https://openalex.org/W4225139566,"Drugs that target histone deacetylase (HDAC) entered the pharmacopoeia in the 2000s. However, some enigmatic phenotypes suggest off-target engagement. Here, we developed a quantitative chemical proteomics assay using immobilized HDAC inhibitors and mass spectrometry that we deployed to establish the target landscape of 53 drugs. The assay covers 9 of the 11 human zinc-dependent HDACs, questions the reported selectivity of some widely-used molecules (notably for HDAC6) and delineates how the composition of HDAC complexes influences drug potency. Unexpectedly, metallo-β-lactamase domain-containing protein 2 (MBLAC2) featured as a frequent off-target of hydroxamate drugs. This poorly characterized palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase is inhibited by 24 HDAC inhibitors at low nanomolar potency. MBLAC2 enzymatic inhibition and knockdown led to the accumulation of extracellular vesicles. Given the importance of extracellular vesicle biology in neurological diseases and cancer, this HDAC-independent drug effect may qualify MBLAC2 as a target for drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4225124346,"This study aimed to examine the associations with epidemiological, behavioral and clinical parameters of IgG antibody responses against the spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) after immunization with two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine in a cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs, n = 439) in Greece. We used a mixed effects model to investigate the potential associations of antibody levels one and three months after vaccination and examined by bootstrapping t-tests the putative effects of gender and age for each period. We also employed exact tests of independence in R × C contingency tables to explore associations between behavioral and gender variables with vaccinations side effects. We found significant differences between males and females as well as between subjects in the youngest (21-30 years) and the older age groups in both study periods. We also detected a decrease in titers with age and time. Males had steeper elimination rates across the age span in both periods, in contrast to females who exhibited a softer elimination titer rate with age in the first period and almost constant titers in the second. Concerning side effects, we found a significant association between pain at the injection site and female sex. Hence, our real-world data analyses revealed potentially important clues into the associations of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike. We discuss the importance of these findings in view of current mass vaccination perspectives and provide useful clues for the design and optimal timing of booster doses for COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4225147667,"Astrocytes are glial cells that interact with neuronal synapses via their distal processes, where they remove glutamate and potassium (K+) from the extracellular space following neuronal activity. Astrocyte clearance of both glutamate and K+ is voltage dependent, but astrocyte membrane potential (Vm) is thought to be largely invariant. As a result, these voltage dependencies have not been considered relevant to astrocyte function. Using genetically encoded voltage indicators to enable the measurement of Vm at peripheral astrocyte processes (PAPs) in mice, we report large, rapid, focal and pathway-specific depolarizations in PAPs during neuronal activity. These activity-dependent astrocyte depolarizations are driven by action potential-mediated presynaptic K+ efflux and electrogenic glutamate transporters. We find that PAP depolarization inhibits astrocyte glutamate clearance during neuronal activity, enhancing neuronal activation by glutamate. This represents a novel class of subcellular astrocyte membrane dynamics and a new form of astrocyte-neuron interaction."

The numerical findings of non-Newtonian fluid are important to the chemical processing industry, mining industry, plastics processing industry, as well as lubrication and biomedical flows. The diversity of regulatory parameters like buoyancy rate, magnetic field, mixed convection, absorption, Brownian motion, thermophoretic diffusion, Deborah number, Lewis number, Prandtl number, Soret number, as well as Dufour number contributes significant impact on the current model. The steps of research methodology are as followed: a) conversion from a separate matrix (PDE) to standard divisive calculations (ODEs), b) Final ODEs are solved in bvp4c program, which developed in MATLAB software, c) The stability analysis part also being developed in bvp4c program, to select the most effective solution in the real liquid state. Lastly, the numerical findings are built on a system of tables and diagrams. As a result, the profiles of velocity, temperature, and concentration are depicted due to the regulatory parameters, as mentioned above. In addition, the characteristics of the local Nusselt, coefficient of skin-friction as well as Sherwood numbers on the Maxwell fluid are described in detail."
https://openalex.org/W4225115301,"Abstract We designed a protein biosensor that uses thermodynamic coupling for sensitive and rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants in serum. The biosensor is a switchable, caged luciferase–receptor-binding domain (RBD) construct that detects serum-antibody interference with the binding of virus RBD to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) as a proxy for neutralization. Our coupling approach does not require target modification and can better distinguish sample-to-sample differences in analyte binding affinity and abundance than traditional competition-based assays."
https://openalex.org/W4225822679,"Iron and steel industries are the major contributors to persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The microbial community present at such sites has the potential to remediate these contaminants. The present study highlights the metabolic potential of the resident bacterial community of PAHs and PCB contaminated soil nearby Bhilai steel plant, Chhattisgarh (India). The GC-MS/MS analysis of soil samples MGB-2 (sludge) and MGB-3 (dry soil) resulted in identification of different classes of POPs including PAHs {benzo[a]anthracene (nd; 17.69%), fluorene (15.89%, nd), pyrene (nd; 18.7%), benzo(b)fluoranthene (3.03%, nd), benzo(k)fluoranthene (11.29%; nd), perylene (5.23%; nd)} and PCBs (PCB-15, PCB-95, and PCB-136). Whole-genome metagenomic analysis by Oxford Nanopore GridION Technology revealed predominance of domain bacteria (97.4%; 97.5%) followed by eukaryote (1.4%; 1.5%), archaea (1.2%; 0.9%) and virus (0.02%; 0.04%) in MGB-2 and MGB-3 respectively. Proteobacteria (44.3%; 50.0%) to be the prominent phylum followed by Actinobacteria (22.1%; 19.5%) in MBG-2 and MBG-3, respectively. However, Eukaryota microbial communities showed a predominance of phylum Ascomycota (20.5%; 23.6%), Streptophyta (18.5%, 17.0%) and unclassified (derived from Eukaryota) (12.1%; 12.2%) in MGB-2 and MGB-3. The sample MGB-3 was richer in macronutrients (C, N, P), supporting high microbial diversity than MGB-2. The presence of reads for biphenyl degradation, dioxin degradation, PAH degradation pathways can be further correlated with the presence of PCB and PAH as detected in the MGB-2 and MGB-3 samples. Further, taxonomic vis-à-vis functional analysis identified Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, Mycobacterium, and Rhodopseudomonas as the keystone degrader of PAH and PCB. Overall, our results revealed the importance of metagenomic and physicochemical analysis of the contaminated site, which improves the understanding of metabolic potential and adaptation of bacteria growing under POP contaminated environments."
https://openalex.org/W4225160271,"Healthcare workers (HCWs) faced a range of stressors during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, contributing to psychological stress. We use a psychological trauma framework to characterize the mental health burden for clinical and non-clinical healthcare worker occupations during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to measure and characterize risk factors for trauma and anxiety-related mental health problems among HCWs at a public hospital in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City (NYC). This study reports findings from a cross-sectional survey of NYC HCWs shortly after the initial 2020 infection surge. Over 800 hospital employees completed the survey that assessed professional quality of life indicators (compassion satisfaction [CS], burnout [BO], secondary traumatic stress [STS]), Coronavirus Anxiety (CS), Obsession with Coronavirus (OC), and PTSD symptoms. The survey also assessed pandemic-related work and life circumstances such as ""do you have a family member or friend who tested positive for COVID"". Relatively small percentages of HCWs endorsed probable Coronavirus Anxiety (6%), PTSD (13%), and Coronavirus Obsession (21%). We observed higher proportions of Burnout (29%), Moderate or High Secondary Traumatic Stress (45%), and High Compassion Satisfaction (52%). Adjusted regression models showed important implications for prior behavioral/emotional health concerns among HCWs, providing care for a patient that died from COVID-19, and other characteristics. This study supports prior studies documenting the mental health consequences for the healthcare workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study builds on that base by including non-clinical staff in the sample and assessing pandemic life-stressors such as caring for sick family members."
https://openalex.org/W4225113875,"Despite advances in resolving the structures of multi-pass membrane proteins, little is known about the native folding pathways of these complex structures. Using single-molecule magnetic tweezers, we here report a folding pathway of purified human glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3) reconstituted within synthetic lipid bilayers. The N-terminal major facilitator superfamily (MFS) fold strictly forms first, serving as a structural template for its C-terminal counterpart. We found polar residues comprising the conduit for glucose molecules present major folding challenges. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane protein complex facilitates insertion of these hydrophilic transmembrane helices, thrusting GLUT3's microstate sampling toward folded structures. Final assembly between the N- and C-terminal MFS folds depends on specific lipids that ease desolvation of the lipid shells surrounding the domain interfaces. Sequence analysis suggests that this asymmetric folding propensity across the N- and C-terminal MFS folds prevails for metazoan sugar porters, revealing evolutionary conflicts between foldability and functionality faced by many multi-pass membrane proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4225132502,"Motivated by the positive psychology movement in the English as Foreign Language (EFL), existing studies have demonstrated that subject-related enjoyment has a positive correlation with academic achievement. However, quite a few studieshave examined why academic enjoyment can predict positive academic achievement. This study aimed to investigate whether behavioral engagement, self-concept, and organizational strategy mediated relations between academic enjoyment and achievement in EFL setting. 528 Chinese secondary school students (Male: N = 280; Female: N = 248) participated in the survey and completed the questionnaires on EFL-related enjoyment, behavioral engagement, self-concept, organizational strategy, and academic performance. Structural equation model (SEM) analyses showed that students' academic enjoyment positively predicted their English achievement. Academic engagement, self-concept, and organizational strategy had parallel multiple mediating effects between academic enjoyment and English achievement. Multi-group SEM analysis demonstrated that the model had invariance across genders, indicating that the model is applicable to both male and female students. Limitations and implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4225162769,"This study was done to investigate the prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation among private medical students in Bangladesh. A total of 237 medical students participated in this cross-sectional web-based survey by e-questionnaire using the Google Form. The study was conducted from November 2020 to December 2020 at Enam Medical College and Hospital which is situated in Savar, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Out of 237 medical students, prevalence of depression was found 58.6%, and prevalence of suicidal ideation was found 27.4% which is higher than the global prevalence. Bivariate and multivariate analysis and logistic regression-based odds ratios (ORs) was done to see the association between grade of depression and suicidal thoughts with different variables. Association between grade of depression with family problems (x2 = 16.716, P = 0.001), drug addiction (x2 = 16.601, P = 0.001), committed relationship status (x2 = 40.292, P = <0.001) were statistically significant. Whereas, the association between suicidal thoughts with family problems (x2 = 29.881, P = <0.001), failed any subject during study (x2 = 12.024, P = 0.007), alcohol uses (x2 = 15.977, P = 0.001), drug addiction (x2 = 22.633, P = <0.001), committed relationship status (x2 = 35.219, P = <0.001) were statistically significant. However, medical students whom had to earn other than their family income were 2.3 times (OR: 2.285, 95% CL: 0.897, 5.820) greater prone to be depressed than those who do not had to earn by themselves. On the contrary, medical students who are single were 2.35 times (OR: 2.352, 95% CL: 0.926, 5.973) greater prone to have suicidal thoughts than the married students. This study showed that a large percentage of Bangladeshi medical students have been suffering from depression and suicidal ideation. Our recommendation for the authority of the medical colleges are, to build a system with counselling facilities inside every medical colleges in Bangladesh."
https://openalex.org/W4225784185,"Next-generation sequencing of circulating tumor DNA presents a promising approach to cancer diagnostics, complementing conventional tissue-based diagnostic testing by enabling minimally invasive serial testing and broad genomic coverage through a simple blood draw to maximize therapeutic benefit to patients. LiquidHALLMARK® is an amplicon-based next-generation sequencing assay developed for the genomic profiling of plasma-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA). The comprehensive 80-gene panel profiles point mutations, insertions/deletions, copy number alterations, and gene fusions, and further detects oncogenic viruses (Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)) and microsatellite instability (MSI). Here, the analytical and clinical validation of the assay is reported. Analytical validation using reference genetic materials demonstrated a sensitivity of 99.38% for point mutations and 95.83% for insertions/deletions at 0.1% variant allele frequency (VAF), and a sensitivity of 91.67% for gene fusions at 0.5% VAF. In non-cancer samples, a high specificity (≥99.9999% per-base) was observed. The limit of detection for copy number alterations, EBV, HBV, and MSI were also empirically determined. Orthogonal comparison of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) variant calls made by LiquidHALLMARK and a reference allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) method for 355 lung cancer specimens revealed an overall concordance of 93.80%, while external validation with cobas® EGFR Mutation Test v2 for 50 lung cancer specimens demonstrated an overall concordance of 84.00%, with a 100% concordance rate for EGFR variants above 0.4% VAF. Clinical application of LiquidHALLMARK in 1,592 consecutive patients demonstrated a high detection rate (74.8% circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-positive in cancer samples) and broad actionability (50.0% of cancer samples harboring alterations with biological evidence for actionability). Among ctDNA-positive lung cancers, 72.5% harbored at least one biomarker with a guideline-approved drug indication. These results establish the high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision of the LiquidHALLMARK assay and supports its clinical application for blood-based genomic testing."
https://openalex.org/W4225132309,"The modern online society requires everyone, especially children and young people, to learn how to use the Internet. Cyberbullying is one misuse that can be detrimental to the cyberbullied individuals' mental health and lifestyle, and it often ends up with the victim becoming depressed, fearful of society, and in the worst cases, suicidal ideation. The aim of this study is to investigate the awareness, perception, and perpetration of cyberbullying by high school students and undergraduates to find ways to prevent cyberbullying in the future. For this cross-sectional study, data were collected in 2020 from 14 schools throughout Thailand and 4 universities in Chiang Mai, Thailand, using two-stage sampling. Chi-squared tests were used to compare differences between the groups. Of the 2,683 high school students, girls perceived cyberbullying more than boys (81.6% vs. 75.4%; p <0.001), with those from the later academic years being more aware of cyberbullying (p = 0.033) and more likely to conduct cyberbullying behavior (p = 0.027). Of the 721 undergraduates, women were more aware of cyberbullying than men (92.1% vs. 82.7%; p <0.001). The most common cause of cyberbullying was aiming to tease the target (67.6% of high school students vs. 82.5% of undergraduates). The most commonly cyberbullying victimization was sending mocking or rebuking messages (29.6% of high school students and 39.6% of undergraduates). The most popular solutions for cyberbullying were to avoid leaving a trace on social media and be with friends who accept who you are. Our findings show that most of the cyberbullying perpetrators did not consider that their actions would have serious consequences and only carried out cyberbullying because of wanting to tease their victims. This is useful information for the cyberbullying solution center, teachers, and parents to recognize how to make the students realize the effects of cyberbullying on the victims."
https://openalex.org/W4225139539,"To improve the recognition accuracy of underwater acoustic targets by artificial neural network, this study presents a new recognition method that integrates a one-dimensional convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network. This new network framework is constructed and applied to underwater acoustic target recognition for the first time. Ship acoustic data are used as input to evaluate the network performance. A visual analysis of the recognition results is performed. The results show that this method can realize the recognition and classification of underwater acoustic targets. Compared with a single neural network, the relevant indices, such as the recognition accuracy of the joint network are considerably higher. This provides a new direction for the application of deep learning in the field of underwater acoustic target recognition."
https://openalex.org/W4225384786,"The mammalian blastocyst undergoes two lineage segregations, that is, formation of the trophectoderm and subsequently differentiation of the hypoblast (HB) from the inner cell mass, leaving the epiblast (EPI) as the remaining pluripotent lineage. To clarify the expression patterns of markers specific for these lineages in bovine embryos, we analyzed day 7, 9, and 12 blastocysts completely produced in vivo by staining for OCT4, NANOG, SOX2 (EPI), and GATA6, SOX17 (HB) and identified genes specific for these developmental stages in a global transcriptomics approach. To study the role of OCT4, we generated OCT4-deficient (OCT4 KO) embryos via somatic cell nuclear transfer or in vitro fertilization. OCT4 KO embryos reached the expanded blastocyst stage by day 8 but lost NANOG and SOX17 expression, while SOX2 and GATA6 were unaffected. Blastocysts transferred to recipient cows from day 6 to 9 expanded, but the OCT4 KO phenotype was not rescued by the uterine environment. Exposure of OCT4 KO embryos to exogenous FGF4 or chimeric complementation with OCT4 intact embryos did not restore NANOG or SOX17 in OCT4-deficient cells. Our data show that OCT4 is required cell autonomously for the maintenance of pluripotency of the EPI and differentiation of the HB in bovine embryos."
https://openalex.org/W4225125200,"The aim of this analysis was to assess the effectiveness of a juvenile outpatient weight management program during the coronavirus pandemic in Germany, which was implemented digitally during the initial lockdown and thereafter under strict hygiene rules (e.g., adapted exercise sessions). Changes in body mass index standard deviation scores (BMI SDS), physical fitness, media consumption, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and social self-concept of 28 children and adolescents were compared to data of 30 participants before the pandemic. Adjusted mean changes from baseline to follow-up in BMI SDS (M = −0.07 ± 0.30), relative physical fitness (M = 0.0 ± 0.3 W/kg), media use (M = 0.5 ± 2.6 hours/day), HRQOL (M = −1.6 ± 15.3), and social self-concept (M = −3.8 ± 13.2) during the pandemic were not significantly different from those of the pre-pandemic participants (all p &gt; 0.05). Therefore, the results suggest that an adjusted approach to weight management, which combined digital and adapted in-person components to meet hygiene requirements during the pandemic, was as effective as the pre-pandemic program. It could thus be a potential solution to ensure continuity of care for vulnerable children with obesity during the pandemic and the associated restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W4225140808,"Mind wandering has been argued to be beneficial for breaking through mental impasses, which leads to better creative performance upon a second attempt (i.e., the incubation effect). However, the evidence is inconsistent. Different from the propensity for mind wandering that has been the focus of past studies, in this study we further examined the role of diversity (i.e., non-repetitiveness of mind wandering respective to its content) and types of mind wandering along the dimensions of intentionality and awareness during incubation when engaging in a 0-back task (a mind wandering-prone condition) and a focused-breathing practice (a mindfulness-induced condition). We proposed that diversity rather than the propensity for mind wandering was crucial for post-incubation divergent creativity and that mindfulness induction would be a more effective way to elicit the incubation effect because it should result in fewer but more diverse mind-wandering incidents than engaging in a mind wandering-prone task. We conducted an experiment with a between-participant variable (incubation tasks: mind wandering-prone, mindfulness-induced, and no incubation). As predicted, the mindfulness-induced group (N = 30) outperformed the control group (N = 31) on flexibility for the unusual uses task measuring divergent thinking after incubation, but the mind wandering-prone group (N = 29) did not outperform the control group. In addition, the diversity of mind wandering and the tendency toward intentional mind wandering predicted the magnitude of incubation effects on flexibility and originality, respectively. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4225156899,"Background Revision endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is often considered for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) if maximal conservative treatment and baseline ESS prove insufficient. Emerging research outlines the risk factors of revision ESS. However, accurately predicting revision ESS at the individual level remains uncertain. This study aims to examine the prediction accuracy of revision ESS and to identify the effects of risk factors at the individual level. Methods We collected demographic and clinical variables from the electronic health records of 767 surgical CRS patients ≥16 years of age. Revision ESS was performed on 111 (14.5%) patients. The prediction accuracy of revision ESS was examined by training and validating different machine learning models, while the effects of variables were analysed using the Shapley values and partial dependence plots. Results The logistic regression, gradient boosting and random forest classifiers performed similarly in predicting revision ESS. Area under the receiving operating characteristic curve ( AUROC ) values were 0.744, 0.741 and 0.730, respectively, using data collected from the baseline visit until six months after baseline ESS. The length of time during which data were collected improved the prediction performance. For data collection times of 0, 3, 6 and 12 months after baseline ESS, AUROC values for the logistic regression were 0.682, 0.715, 0.744 and 0.784, respectively. The number of visits before or after baseline ESS, the number of days from the baseline visit to the baseline ESS, patient age, CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), asthma, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug exacerbated respiratory disease and immunodeficiency or suspicion of it all associated with revision ESS. Patient age and number of visits before baseline ESS carried non-linear effects for predictions. Conclusions Intelligent data analysis identified important predictors of revision ESS at the individual level, such as the frequency of clinical visits, patient age, Type 2 high diseases and immunodeficiency or a suspicion of it."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, home-based delivery of yoga increased. However, no studies to date have explored online home-based yoga for individuals living with MS, more specifically the motivations, experiences, or the sustainability of home-based yoga practice for individuals living with MS.This study aimed to explore the facilitators and barriers of online yoga provision for individuals living with MS.One focus group and three semi-structured interviews were carried out online via Zoom with one yoga instructor and seven yoga participants living with MS. Thematic Analysis was used to analyse this data.Two themes were generated from the interviews, the environment and future provision, each with their own sub-themes. The themes reflect various facilitators and barriers of home-based yoga provision which differed depending upon the individuals home environment, social connections, physical ability, and confidence practising yoga. Furthermore, preferences of home provision fluctuated over time depending upon symptoms of MS.Home-based yoga practice is a viable and enjoyable option for individuals living with MS. It is recommended that yoga studios offering home-based yoga provision consider individual differences in preference, as well as fluctuations in symptoms that may create inequitable access to services and may prevent participation for some."
https://openalex.org/W4225151874,"Reagent urinalysis dipstick and filtration have been recommended diagnostic methods for the detection of urogenital schistosomiasis. However, the accurate diagnosis of light infections using these methods presents a major challenge. This study evaluates the diagnosis accuracy of light infection with Schistosoma haematobium in study participants living in Wolaita Zone, an area targeted for sustainable control of Schistosomiasis, and ultimately interrupt transmission. Urine samples were collected from children and adults in surveys carried out during baseline and longitudinal sentinel site surveys conducted from 2018 to 2020. All urine samples were tested using a reagent urinalysis dipstick test (Haemastix) to detect microhaematuria with reference urine filtration technique as a proxy for S. haematobium infection. Sensitivity and specificity were determined in diagnosing urogenital schistosomiasis. Cohen's Kappa statistics was done for the agreement of these diagnostic methods. A total of 12,102 participants were enrolled in the current baseline study. Among them, 285 (2.35%) samples tested positive for microhaematuria and 21 (0.20%) positive for S. haematobium eggs. A total of 4,357 samples were examined in year 1 and year 2 using urine dipsticks, and urine filtration 172 (3.95%) and 2 (0.05%) were positive for microhaematuria and S. haematobium eggs. The reagent urinalysis dipsticks showed the highest sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing light intensity of infection,100% (95% CI:85.18-100.00) and 97.4% (95% CI: 97.10-97.60), respectively. There is a slight agreement between the two methods (Kappa = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.01-0.18). The present study revealed very low prevalence and light intensity of S. haematobium infections. The study also highlights that the dipstick test is considered a useful adjunct diagnostic tool for population-based control of urogenital schistosomiasis."
https://openalex.org/W4225162129,"There are many patients in general practice with health complaints that cannot be medically explained. Some of these patients attribute their health complaints to dental amalgam restorations. This study examined the cost-effectiveness of the removal of amalgam restorations in patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) attributed to amalgam fillings compared to usual care, based on a prospective cohort study in Norway. Costs were determined using a micro-costing approach at the individual level. Health outcomes were documented at baseline and approximately two years later for both the intervention and the usual care using EQ-5D-5L. Quality adjusted life year (QALY) was used as a main outcome measure. A decision analytical model was developed to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Both probabilistic and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the impact of uncertainty in costs and effectiveness. In patients who attribute health complaints to dental amalgam restorations and fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria, amalgam removal is associated with modest increase in costs at societal level as well as improved health outcomes. In the base-case analysis, the mean incremental cost per patient in the amalgam group was NOK 19 416 compared to the MUPS group, while mean incremental QALY was 0.119 with a time horizon of two years. Thus, the incremental costs per QALY of the intervention was NOK 162 680, which is usually considered cost effective in Norway. The estimated incremental cost per QALY decreased with increasing time horizon, and amalgam removal was found to be cost saving over both 5 and 10 years. This study provides insight into the costs and health outcomes associated with the removal of amalgam restorations in patients who attribute health complaints to dental amalgam fillings, which are appropriate instruments to inform health care priorities."
https://openalex.org/W4225422781,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin disease, which is associated with intense itch, skin barrier dysfunction and eczematous lesions. Aberrant IL-20 expression has been implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. However, the role of IL-20 in AD remains unknown. Here, RNA-seq, Q-PCR, and immunocytochemistry were utilized to examine disease-driven changes of IL-20 and its cognate receptor subunits in skin from healthy human subjects, AD patients and murine AD-models. Calcium imaging, knockdown and cytokine array were used to investigate IL-20-evoked responses in keratinocytes and sensory neurons. The murine cheek model and behavioral scoring were employed to evaluate IL-20-elicited sensations in vivo. We found that transcripts and protein of IL-20 were upregulated in skin from human AD and murine AD-like models. Topical MC903 treatment in mice ear enhanced IL-20R1 expression in the trigeminal sensory ganglia, suggesting a lesion-associated and epidermal-driven mechanism for sensitization of sensory IL-20 signaling. IL-20 triggered calcium influx in both keratinocytes and sensory neurons, and promoted their AD-related molecule release and transcription of itch-related genes. In sensory neurons, IL-20 application increased TLR2 transcripts, implicating a link between innate immune response and IL-20. In a murine cheek model of acute itch, intradermal injection IL-20 and IL-13 elicited significant itch-like behavior, though only when co-injected. Our findings provide novel insights into IL-20 function in peripheral (skin-derived) itch and clinically relevant intercellular neuron-epidermal communication, highlighting a role of IL-20 signaling in the pathophysiology of AD, thus forming a new basis for the development of a novel antipruritic strategy via interrupting IL-20 epidermal pathways."
https://openalex.org/W4225120487,"A standardized objective evaluation method is needed to compare machine learning (ML) algorithms as these tools become available for clinical use. Therefore, we designed, built, and tested an evaluation pipeline with the goal of normalizing performance measurement of independently developed algorithms, using a common test dataset of our clinical imaging. Three vendor applications for detecting solid, part-solid, and groundglass lung nodules in chest CT examinations were assessed in this retrospective study using our data-preprocessing and algorithm assessment chain. The pipeline included tools for image cohort creation and de-identification; report and image annotation for ground-truth labeling; server partitioning to receive vendor “black box” algorithms and to enable model testing on our internal clinical data (100 chest CTs with 243 nodules) from within our security firewall; model validation and result visualization; and performance assessment calculating algorithm recall, precision, and receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). Algorithm true positives, false positives, false negatives, recall, and precision for detecting lung nodules were as follows: Vendor-1 (194, 23, 49, 0.80, 0.89); Vendor-2 (182, 270, 61, 0.75, 0.40); Vendor-3 (75, 120, 168, 0.32, 0.39). The AUCs for detection of solid (0.61–0.74), groundglass (0.66–0.86) and part-solid (0.52–0.86) nodules varied between the three vendors. Our ML model validation pipeline enabled testing of multi-vendor algorithms within the institutional firewall. Wide variations in algorithm performance for detection as well as classification of lung nodules justifies the premise for a standardized objective ML algorithm evaluation process."

The main aim of this study is to describe the distributional biogeography of its coastal fish fauna in relation to contemporary ichthyogeographic and ecoregional concepts. Inferences are drawn with regard to the marine biogeographic arrangement and ecoregional partitioning of the Arabian region. The main datasets comprise eight and twenty selected families including 404 and 898 species, respectively, from Arabian ecoregions. The Socotra Archipelago has close affinities to a putative ecoregion in the eastern Gulf of Aden that extends to southern Oman. It is more closely related to the Arabian Sea coast of Oman than to ecoregions in the Red Sea and a putative ecoregion in the western Gulf of Aden. The Gulf of Aden does not represent a consistent ecoregion in ichthyogeographic terms, because its eastern and western parts are less closely related to one another than to other ecoregions. The Socotra Archipelago and the eastern Gulf of Aden should therefore not be assigned to a joined province with Red Sea ecoregions. The coastal fish faunas of the southern Red Sea have close affinities with those of the western Gulf of Aden. The Arabian/Persian Gulf is least related to the other Arabian ecoregions. The authors posit the Socotra Archipelago as a distinct ecoregion, either on its own or in combination with affiliated mainland areas. This best reflects the ichthyogeographic data and the exceptionally high levels of fish and overall marine diversity. Two alternative ecoregional delineations are proposed, serving as working hypotheses for onward research."
https://openalex.org/W4225149885,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a picornavirus that produces a highly transmissible vesicular disease that can devastate meat and dairy production to such an extent that FMDV-free countries commit significant economic resources to maintain their FMDV-free status. Senecavirus A (SVA), also a picornavirus, causes vesicular disease in swine that is indistinguishable from FMDV. Since 2015, SVA outbreaks have been reported around the world requiring FMDV-free countries to investigate these cases to rule out FMDV. Understanding the pathogenesis of the SVA and its ability to transmit to naïve populations is critical to formulating control and prevention measures, which could reduce FMDV investigations. The primary objective of this study was to determine the infectious dose of SVA in market weight and neonatal pigs. A 2011 SVA isolate was serially hundred-fold diluted to create four challenge inoculums ranging from 106.5 to 100.5 TCID50/ml. Four market weight pigs individually housed were intranasally inoculated with 5 mL of each dose (n = 16). Serial ten-fold dilutions were used to create 6 challenge inoculums ranging from 105.5 to 100.5 TCID50/ml for neonatal pigs. Again, four animals in individual housing were challenged orally with 2 mL of each dose (n = 24). Detection of SVA by PCR in collected samples and/or neutralizing antibody response was utilized to classify an animal as infected. The minimum infectious dose for this study in market weight animals was 1,260 TCID50/ml (103.1 TCID50/ml) and for neonates it was 316 TCID50/ml (102.5 TCID50/ml). Knowledge of the infectious dose of SVA can guide biosecurity and disinfection measures to control the spread of SVA."
https://openalex.org/W4225162066,"Malnutrition and malaria are common co-morbidities in low-income countries, especially among under-fives children. But the malnutrition situation in Masasi and Nanyumbu districts, its interaction with malaria infection and the influence of socioeconomic factors are not well understood.Children aged between 3-59 months in Masasi and Nanyumbu were screened for nutritional status and malaria infection in the community. Nutritional status was determined using age and anthropometric parameters. Z-scores (weight for age (WAZ), height for age (HAZ) and weight for height (WHZ)) were calculated based on the World Health Organisation (WHO) growth reference curves. Malaria infection was determined using malaria rapid diagnostic test and microscopy. Hemoglobin concentration was assessed using HemoCue spectrophotometer, and anemia was classified as hemoglobin concentration < 11.0g/dL. Structured questionnaire was used to collect socio- demographic information electronically.A total of 2242 children, 1539 (68.6%) from Masasi and 1169 (52.1%) females were involved in the study. The mean z-scores (WAZ = -0.60 and HAZ = -1.56) were lower than the WHO reference population. The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 49%, and it was significantly higher in Nanyumbu (52.5%) than in Masasi (47.3%), (x2 = 5.045, p = 0.025). Prevalence of malnutrition was higher in boys (53.0%) than in girls (45.0%) (x2 = 13.9, p < 0.001). Stunting was the most prevalent component of undernutrition; it was slightly prevalent in Nanyumbu (46.5%) compared to Masasi (42.0%), (x2 = 3.624, p = 0.057) and in boys (48.2%) than in girls (39.1%), x2 = 17.44, p<0.001. Only 15.8% of the undernourished children had malaria infection. Sex, age group and anaemia were significantly associated with undernourishment (p<0.05), while district and malaria infection were marginally (p≤0.06) associated with undernourishment. None of the undernutrition indices was associated with malaria infection.Undernutrition was highly prevalent in the study population and was influenced sex, age, anaemia and malaria infection. More emphasis is needed to address the malnutrition problem especially stunting in Masasi and Nanyumbu districts."
https://openalex.org/W4225124475,"Angiogenesis is vital during pregnancy for remodeling and enhancing vasodilation of maternal uterine arteries, and increasing uterine blood flow. Abnormal angiogenesis is associated with decreased uteroplacental blood flow and development of pregnancy disorders such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, preterm delivery, stillbirth, and miscarriage. The mechanisms that contribute to normal angiogenesis remain obscure. Our previous studies demonstrated that expression of the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) is increased while the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) is unchanged in the endothelium of uterine arteries, and that AT2R-mediated pregnancy adaptation facilitates enhanced vasodilation and uterine arterial blood flow. However, the role of AT2R in regulating angiogenesis during pregnancy has never been studied. This study examines whether or not AT2R activation induces angiogenesis and, if so, what mechanisms are involved. To this end, we used primary human uterine artery endothelial cells (hUAECs) isolated from pregnant and nonpregnant women undergoing hysterectomy. The present study shows that Compound 21, a selective AT2R agonist, induced proliferation of pregnant-hUAECs, but not nonpregnant-hUAECs, in a concentration-dependent manner, and that this C21-induced mitogenic effect was blocked by PD123319, a selective AT2R antagonist. The mitogenic effects induced by C21 were inhibited by blocking JNK-but not ERK, PI3K, and p38-signaling pathways. In addition, C21 concentration dependently increased cell migration and capillary-like tube formation in pregnant-hUAECs. The membrane-based antibody array showed that C21 increased expression of multiple angiogenic proteins, including EGF, bFGF, leptin, PLGF, IGF-1, and angiopoietins. Our qPCR analysis demonstrates that C21-induced increase in expression of these angiogenic proteins correlates with a proportional increase in mRNA expression, indicating that AT2R activates angiogenic proteins at the transcriptional level. In summary, the present study shows that AT2R activation induces angiogenesis of hUAECs in a pregnancy-specific manner through JNK-mediated pathways with associated transcriptional upregulation of multiple proangiogenic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4225146918,"Invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) is life-threatening and associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The study aimed to examine the clinical characteristics and hospital-based healthcare resource use and related costs following IMD diagnosis in France.Patients admitted to hospitals due to IMD between 2014 and 2016 were selected from the French hospital discharge database (PMSI). Demographics, clinical outcomes and health utilization (HRU) during index hospitalization were described. HRU and costs during the follow-up period were also examined. A generalized linear model was applied to examine 1-year costs after index hospitalization adjusting for age, type of IMD and presence of sequelae at index hospitalization.A total of 1,344 patients were identified. About 30% cases were in children < 5 years old and 25% aged 10-24 years. Majority of patients presented as meningococcal meningitis (59%), 25% as meningococcaemia, and 9% both. The case fatality rate during the index hospitalization was 6%. About 15% of patients had at least one sequela at index hospital discharge. The median length of stay and the median cost of index hospitalization were 9 days and 8,045€, respectively. Patients with at least one sequela, with clinical manifestation as both meningitis and meningococcaemia, or aged 25 years and older were statistically significantly associated with higher costs than others.IMD is unpredictable and can occur in all ages. The study highlights the severity and high health and economic burdens associated with the disease. The data underlines the importance of prevention against IMD through vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4225147151,"Background and purpose PARP inhibitors have been shown to increase the efficacy of radiotherapy in preclinical models. Radioimmunotherapy results in selective radiation cytotoxicity of targeted tumour cells. Here we investigate the combined effect of anti-CD37 β-emitting 177 Lu-NNV003 radioimmunotherapy and the PARP inhibitor olaparib, and gene expression profiles in CD37 positive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines. Materials and methods The combined effect of 177 Lu-NNV003 and olaparib was studied in seven cell lines using a fixed-ratio ray design, and combination index was calculated for each combination concentration. mRNA was extracted before and after treatment with the drug combination. After RNA-sequencing, hierarchical clustering was performed on basal gene expression profiles and on differentially expressed genes after combination treatment from baseline. Functional gene annotation analysis of significant differentially expressed genes after combination treatment was performed to identify enriched biological processes. Results The combination of olaparib and 177 Lu-NNV003 was synergistic in four of seven cell lines, antagonistic in one and both synergistic and antagonistic (conditionally synergistic) in two, depending on the concentration ratio between olaparib and 177 Lu-NNV003. Cells treated with the combination significantly overexpressed genes in the TP53 signalling pathway. However, cluster analysis did not identify gene clusters that correlate with the sensitivity of cells to single agent or combination treatment. Conclusion The cytotoxic effect of the combination of the PARP inhibitor olaparib and the β-emitting radioimmunoconjugate 177 Lu-NNV003 was synergistic in the majority of tested lymphoma cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W4225149232,"Chloride ions are toxic for most acidophilic microorganisms. In this study, the chloride tolerance mechanisms in the acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacterium Leptospirillum ferriphilum DSM 14647 adapted to 180 mM NaCl were investigated by a transcriptomic approach. Results showed that 99 genes were differentially expressed in the adapted versus the non-adapted cultures, of which 69 and 30 were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively. Genes that were up-regulated include carbonic anhydrase, cytochrome c oxidase (ccoN) and sulfide:quinone reductase (sqr), likely involved in intracellular pH regulation. Towards the same end, the cation/proton antiporter CzcA (czcA) was down-regulated. Adapted cells showed a higher oxygen consumption rate (2.2 x 10-9 ppm O2 s-1cell-1) than non-adapted cells (1.2 x 10-9 ppm O2 s-1cell-1). Genes coding for the antioxidants flavohemoprotein and cytochrome c peroxidase were also up-regulated. Measurements of the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level revealed that adapted cells had a lower level than non-adapted cells, suggesting that detoxification of ROS could be an important strategy to withstand NaCl. In addition, data analysis revealed the up-regulation of genes for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (iscR), metal reduction (merA) and activation of a cellular response mediated by diffusible signal factors (DSFs) and the second messenger c-di-GMP. Several genes related to the synthesis of lipopolysaccharide and peptidoglycan were consistently down-regulated. Unexpectedly, the genes ectB, ectC and ectD involved in the biosynthesis of the compatible solutes (hydroxy)ectoine were also down-regulated. In line with these findings, although hydroxyectoine reached 20 nmol mg-1 of wet biomass in non-adapted cells, it was not detected in L. ferriphilum adapted to NaCl, suggesting that this canonical osmotic stress response was dispensable for salt adaptation. Differentially expressed transcripts and experimental validations suggest that adaptation to chloride in acidophilic microorganisms involves a multifactorial response that is different from the response in other bacteria studied."
https://openalex.org/W4225163425,"This paper analyses the association between self-perceived job insecurity and self-reported health by comparing two population groups, native-born and migrant workers, in EU15 countries. The econometric analysis employs data from the Sixth European Working Conditions Survey that was released in 2017. The health outcome examined in this study is self-reported health, which is a subjective indicator. Self-perceived job insecurity is an individual’s subjective evaluation of the possibility of future job loss. The association between job insecurity and self-reported health was tested using standard probit models and standard ordered probit models, considering the entire population sample, only native-born workers, only migrant workers. The results show that workers who think that they might lose their jobs have a lower probability of reporting very good and good health than workers who do not worry about losing their jobs, with job insecurity reducing the probability of reporting good health more for migrant workers than for native-born workers."
https://openalex.org/W4225370707,"There is increasing evidence that aquatic ectotherms are especially vulnerable to global warming since their metabolic demands increase with ambient temperature while water-oxygen content decreases. The possible role of shrinking aerobic scope in limiting performance has been much discussed; however, less attention has been given to whether tissue-level changes in the efficiency of oxygen usage occur at elevated temperatures. Here, we show that this varies widely among individuals, with consequences for performance. We examined the inter-individual variation in growth rate and mitochondrial function from white muscle and liver of brown trout (Salmo trutta) acclimated to either high (19.5°C) or near-optimal temperature (12°C). Liver (but not muscle) mitochondria showed a positive relationship between growth rate and maximal oxidative phosphorylation at both temperatures, and a negative relationship between growth rate and ROS release. There was a positive correlation in both tissues between individual mitochondrial phosphorylation efficiency and growth rate, but only at 19.5°C. In this representative of aquatic ectotherms, an individual's liver mitochondrial efficiency thus seems to dictate its capacity to grow at elevated temperatures. This suggests that individual heterogeneity in cellular function may cause variation in the thermal limits of aquatic ectotherms and could adversely affect wild populations in warming environments."
https://openalex.org/W4225384246,"Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is caused by the formation of new blood vessels in the angle, iris, and cornea in retinal ischemic disease, such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and retinal vein occlusion (RVO), which can reduce the visual acuity. However, the pathophysiological symptoms of NVG are still not well understood because there is no model for the formation of NVG in the angle, iris, and cornea. The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of NVG during ischemic disease, in a murine model of retinal ischemia. We evaluated the changes of the intraocular pressure (IOP) and pathological symptoms in the anterior eye segment and retina in this model, and the changes in the RNA or protein expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibrosis-related factors were analyzed in the retina and cornea by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or western blot, respectively. Furthermore, we examined the changes in IOP after intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF antibody. First, NVG formed in the retinal ischemic murine model, and the IOP was elevated in mice with NVG formation. Interestingly, VEGF expression was decreased in the retina but increased in the cornea in the murine model of NVG. On the other hand, fibrosis-related factors were increased in the retina and also significantly increased in the cornea in NVG. Moreover, the administration of anti-VEGF antibody immediately after vessel occlusion suppressed the increase in IOP, but administration at 7 days after vessel occlusion accelerated the increase in IOP. These findings suggest that the formation of NVG may be correlated with the pathological symptoms of retinal ischemic disease, via changes in VEGF and fibrosis-related factor expression."

However, as this is a nascent area of research, few tools are available for the rapid analysis of cell behavior. Here, we demonstrate that a novel Fiji/ImageJ-based plugin, Analyze_Blebs, can be used to quickly obtain cell migration parameters and morphometrics from time lapse images. As validation, we show that Analyze_Blebs can detect significant differences in cell migration and morphometrics, such as the largest bleb size, upon introducing different live markers of F-actin, including F-tractin and LifeAct tagged with green and red fluorescent proteins. We also demonstrate, using flow cytometry, that live markers increase total levels of F-actin. Furthermore, that F-tractin increases cell stiffness, which was found to correlate with a decrease in migration, thus reaffirming the importance of cell mechanics as a determinant of Leader Bleb-Based Migration (LBBM)."
https://openalex.org/W4226318985,"Arthropod predators are important for ecosystem functioning by providing top-down regulation of insect herbivores. As predator communities and activity are influenced by biotic and abiotic factors on different spatial scales, the strength of top-down regulation ('arthropod predation') is also likely to vary. Understanding the combined effects of potential drivers on arthropod predation is urgently needed with regard to anthropogenic climate and land-use change. In a large-scale study, we recorded arthropod predation rates using artificial caterpillars on 113 plots of open herbaceous vegetation embedded in contrasting habitat types (forest, grassland, arable field, settlement) along climate and land-use gradients in Bavaria, Germany. As potential drivers we included habitat characteristics (habitat type, plant species richness, local mean temperature and mean relative humidity during artificial caterpillar exposure), landscape diversity (0.5-3.0-km, six scales), climate (multi-annual mean temperature, 'MAT') and interactive effects of habitat type with other drivers. We observed no substantial differences in arthropod predation rates between the studied habitat types, related to plant species richness and across the Bavarian-wide climatic gradient, but predation was limited when local mean temperatures were low and tended to decrease towards higher relative humidity. Arthropod predation rates increased towards more diverse landscapes at a 2-km scale. Interactive effects of habitat type with local weather conditions, plant species richness, landscape diversity and MAT were not observed. We conclude that landscape diversity favours high arthropod predation rates in open herbaceous vegetation independent of the dominant habitat in the vicinity. This finding may be harnessed to improve top-down control of herbivores, e.g. agricultural pests, but further research is needed for more specific recommendations on landscape management. The absence of MAT effects suggests that high predation rates may occur independent of moderate increases of MAT in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W4225114707,"This retrospective cohort study assessed the evolution of corneal transplantation and its indications in the last 21 years (2000-2020) in a specialized ophthalmology department in a tertiary referral center in France.The surgical techniques and indications, patient age and sex, and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) 6 months after keratoplasty were extracted.In total, 1042 eyes underwent keratoplasty in 2000-2020. Annual numbers of corneal transplantations increased by 2.2-fold. Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) was the sole technique for the first 11 years. Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) and Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) were introduced in 2011 and 2014, respectively. Cases of both quickly increased, accounting for 28% and 41% of cases in 2015-2020, respectively. Eventually, DSAEK and DMEK were respectively used for most pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (PBK) and all Fuchs endothelial cell dystrophy (FECD) cases. PKP cases declined to 27%. Deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) was rare (3% of all cases). These changes associated with rises in PBK and particularly FECD cases, and a strong decline in keratoconus, causing FECD, PBK, and keratoconus to move from being the 4th, 1st, and 3rd most common indications to the 1st, 2nd, and 6th, respectively. On average, BCVA improved by 0.1-0.3 logMAR. Patient age dropped steadily over time. Female predominance was observed.The invention of DSAEK and then DMEK precipitated an enormous change in clinical practice and a large expansion of keratoplasty to new indications. This study confirms and extends previous findings in other countries."

Emerging evidence suggests that aberrant DNA repair is an underlying mechanism of lupus development. We previously showed that the POLBY265C/C mutation, which results in development of an aberrant immune repertoire, leads to lupus-like disease in mice. To address whether the hematopoietic compartment is sufficient for lupus development, we transplanted bone marrow cells from POLBY265C/C and POLB+/+ into wild-type congenic mice. Only mice transplanted with the POLBY265C/C bone marrow develop high levels of antinuclear antibodies and renal disease. In conclusion, we show that the hematopoietic compartment harvested from the POLBY265C/C mice is sufficient for development of autoimmune disease."
https://openalex.org/W4225121218,"Use of laparotomy sponges to protect abdominal viscera during gastrointestinal surgery is described in nonspecific terms by various sources, but no definitive guidelines have been established in veterinary literature. The objective of this study was to compare the in vitro efficacy of various layer-densities of laparotomy sponges at reducing bacterial contamination from multiple contaminant volumes during multiple exposure times. A standardized Escherichia coli inoculum water solution was applied over sterile laparotomy sponges overlying blood agar plates. Four laparotomy sponge layer-densities, 4 volumes of E . coli inoculum water solution, and 4 exposure times were evaluated. All blood agar plates were incubated for 48 hours followed by surface area measurements of colonization of each blood agar plate at 24 and 48 hours. The procedure was repeated thrice. Bacterial colonization occurred on 100% (192/192) of inoculated blood agar plates. There was a statistically significant decrease in colonized area with increasing layer-density of laparotomy sponges (P&lt;0.0001). Comparison between the layer-density of sponges were statistically significant in resulting infected area (P&lt;0.01), except comparison between 6- and 8-layers (P = 0.9490). Colonized area was not significantly altered by time of exposure. Results suggested that increasing the layer-density of laparotomy sponges has significant effect on reducing strikethrough bacterial colonization in an in vitro model. The results of this study can be used when performing gastrointestinal surgery to help guide laparotomy sponge use to reduce peritoneal bacterial contamination."
https://openalex.org/W4225128775,"Given the rapidly increasing number of immigrants, it is crucial to address health care issues involving immigrants to facilitate their safe and secure settlement. Especially for common chronic diseases, such as diabetes, immigrants face more complex obstacles to manage their chronic conditions than do native-born residents. Therefore, we aimed to assess differences in the incidence and associated risk factors of cardio-cerebrovascular (CCV) complications of immigrants compared with native-born Koreans with diabetes.Immigrants and native-born Koreans who had new diagnosis of diabetes and simultaneously received anti-diabetic prescriptions in 2012 were defined by using Korean National Health Insurance Claim Database(KNHICD). CCV complications were assessed at a 3-year follow-up from the index date. We assessed differences in the CCV complications and risk factors using multiple cox regression models.In total, 4,008 patients (668 of immigrants and 3,340 of native-born Koreans) who had newly diagnosed diabetes and simultaneously received anti-diabetic prescriptions in 2012 were selected. Immigrants with diabetes were at a 1.39 times higher risk of having CCV complications than native-born Koreans with diabetes (95% CI: 1.021-1.881). Patients who had a usual sources of care (USC) presented a significantly reduced risk of cardio-cerebrovascular complication (HR: 0.452; 95% CI: 0.342-0.598) in both immigrants and native Koreans. In subgroup analysis in immigrants, patients having USC showed decreased risk of CCV incidence (HR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.175-0.703), whereas >60 years old and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score >1 presented increased risk of CCV complications.Immigrants with diabetes have a higher risk of CCV complications than native-born Koreans with diabetes. However, having a USC significantly decreased the risk of CCV complications. Therefore, the utilization of USC will benefit to reduce diabetic complications in immigrants as well as reduction of overall health care cost burden, it would be necessary to implement USC in diabetes care at the initial disease stage."

Aimed at the time-complex and difficulty in applying real-time processing, an evolutionary multi-objective optimization sparse decomposition algorithm for hyperspectral images is proposed. Instead of using OMP for the matching process to search optimal atoms, the proposed algorithm explores the idea of reference point non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA) to optimize the matching process of OMP. Take two objective function to establish the multi-objective sparse decomposition optimization model, including the largest inner product of matching atoms and image residuals, and the smallest correlation between atoms. Utilize NSGA-III with advantage of high accuracy to solve the optimization model, and the implementation process of NSGA-III-OMP is presented. The experimental results and analysis carried on four hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that, compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed NSGA-III-OMP algorithm has effectively improved the sparse decomposition performance and efficiency, and can effectively solve the sparse decomposition optimization problem of hyperspectral images."
https://openalex.org/W4225132566,"Given the relatively high rates of suicidal ideation and attempt among people with chronic pain, there is a need to understand the underlying factors to target suicide prevention efforts. To date, no study has examined the association between pain phenotypes and suicide related behaviors among those with mild traumatic brain injuries.To determine if pain phenotypes were independently associated with suicidal ideation / attempt or if comorbidities within the pain phenotypes account for the association between pain phenotypes and suicide related behaviors.This is a longitudinal retrospective cohort study of suicide ideation/attempts among pain phenotypes previously derived using general mixture latent variable models of the joint distribution of repeated measures of pain scores and pain medications/treatment. We used national VA inpatient, outpatient, and pharmacy data files for Post-9/11 Veterans with mild traumatic injury who entered VA care between fiscal years (FY) 2007 and 2009. We considered a counterfactual causal modeling framework to assess the extent that the pain phenotypes during years 1-5 of VA care were predictive of suicide ideation/attempt during years 6-8 of VA care conditioned on covariates being balanced between pain phenotypes.Without adjustment, pain phenotypes were significant predictors of suicide related behaviors. When we used propensity scores to balance the comorbidities present in the pain phenotypes, the pain phenotypes were no longer significantly associated with suicide related behaviors.These findings suggest that suicide ideation/attempt is associated with pain trajectories primarily through latent multimorbidity. Therefore, it is critical to identify and manage comorbidities (e.g., depression, post-traumatic stress disorder) to prevent tragic outcomes associated with suicide related behaviors throughout the course of chronic pain and mild traumatic brain injury management."

Unrelated adult volunteers (n = 942) were used as the control.No polyalanine tract expansion was detected in the SUID cases. The allelic frequencies of repeat contractions and SNP (rs28647582) in intron 2 were not significantly different from that in those control group. Further extensive sequencing revealed a non-polyalanine repeat mutation (NPARM) of c.905A>C in a sudden death case of a one-month-old male infant. This missense mutation (p.Asn302Thr), registered as rs779068107, was annotated to 'Affected status is unknown', but it might be associated with the sudden death.NPARM was more plausibly related to sudden unexpected death than expansions because of severe clinical complications. This finding indicates possible CCHS involvement in forensic autopsy cases without ante-mortem diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4225134710,"Management actions intended to benefit fish in large rivers can directly or indirectly affect multiple ecosystem components. Without consideration of the effects of management on non-target ecosystem components, unintended consequences may limit management efficacy. Monitoring can help clarify the effects of management actions, including on non-target ecosystem components, but only if data are collected to characterize key ecosystem processes that could affect the outcome. Scientists from across the U.S. convened to develop a conceptual model that would help identify monitoring information needed to better understand how natural and anthropogenic factors affect large river fishes. We applied the conceptual model to case studies in four large U.S. rivers. The application of the conceptual model indicates the model is flexible and relevant to large rivers in different geographic settings and with different management challenges. By visualizing how natural and anthropogenic drivers directly or indirectly affect cascading ecosystem tiers, our model identified critical information gaps and uncertainties that, if resolved, could inform how to best meet management objectives. Despite large differences in the physical and ecological contexts of the river systems, the case studies also demonstrated substantial commonalities in the data needed to better understand how stressors affect fish in these systems. For example, in most systems information on river discharge and water temperature were needed and available. Conversely, information regarding trophic relationships and the habitat requirements of larval fishes were generally lacking. This result suggests that there is a need to better understand a set of common factors across large-river systems. We provide a stepwise procedure to facilitate the application of our conceptual model to other river systems and management goals."
https://openalex.org/W4225142502,"Anaphylaxis is an allergic disease with fatal respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms that require immediate emergency treatment. We aimed to understand the characteristics and frequency of emergency department (ED) visits of patients with anaphylaxis in Korea.Between 2007 and 2013, using data from 147 ED from the National Emergency Department Information System in Korea, we retrospectively evaluated patients with a primary diagnosis of anaphylaxis.During the study, a total 23,313 patients visited the ED due to anaphylaxis. The number of patients with anaphylaxis who visited the ED increased from 3.0 per 100,000 population in 2007 to 11.6 per 100,000 population in 2013 (P<0.001). Overall, the frequency of anaphylaxis emergency department visits increased by 1.24 times each year (95% CI 1.23-1.25). The risk of visiting ED due to anaphylaxis by population-based age-specific group was highest in the 60-69 years old (OR 2.30, 95% CI 1.96-2.70). Deaths from anaphylaxis increased by 1.35 times per year (95% CI 1.13-1.62). The causes of anaphylaxis were unknown (80.8%; 95% CI 80.35-81.38), drugs (8.9%; 95% CI 8.47-9.24), food (4.1%; 95% CI 3.87-4.39), bees (3.2%; 95% CI 3.02-3.48) and arthropods (2.3%; 95% CI 2.11-2.48). In 2009, drugs were the most common cause of anaphylaxis in November (35.5%), followed by food in May (15.5%) (P<0.001). Between July and September, stings from insects were the most common causes (P<0.001). By age, food was the most common cause in children aged <6 years (7.6%, <12 months; 9.0%, 1-6 years) and drugs in those aged ≥7 years. The 7-year overall mortality rate was 0.104 case per 1,000,000 population; men accounted for 77.8% of the deaths. By region, the number of cases was the highest in metropolitan areas, Gyeonggi and Seoul; however, the number of anaphylaxis cases per 100,000 population was the highest in Jeju and Gangwon.Based on ICD-10 codes, the number of ED visits due to anaphylaxis is increasing in Korea, and the incidence of anaphylaxis varies by region, season, and age."
https://openalex.org/W4225143243,"Temperature and competition are two of the main factors determining ant community assemblages. Temperature may allow species to forage more or less efficiently throughout the day (in accordance with the maximum activity temperature of each species). Competition can be observed and quantified from species replacements occurring during resource exploitation. We studied the interspecific competitive interactions of ant communities from the Doñana Biological Reserve (southern Spain). Ants were sampled from pitfall traps and baits in three habitats with contrasted vegetation physiognomy (savin forest, pine forest, and dry scrubland). We measured the temperature during the competitive interactions between species and created a thermal competition index (TCI) to assess the relative contribution of temperature and numerical dominance to the competitive outcomes. Temperature had unequal effects on ant activity in each type of habitat, and modulated competitive interactions. The TCI showed that a species’ success during pair interactions (replacements at baits) was driven by the proportion of workers between the two competing species and by the species-specific effect of temperature (how advantageous the temperature change is for each species during bait replacement). During competitive interactions, the effect of temperature (higher values of TCI) and numeric supremacy (higher worker proportion) gave higher success probabilities. Interspecific competitive relationships in these Mediterranean ant communities are habitat dependent and greatly influenced by temperature."
https://openalex.org/W4225154703,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by blocked differentiation and extensive proliferation of hematopoietic progenitors/precursors. Relapse is often observed after chemotherapy due to the presence of residual leukemic cells, which is also called minimal residual disease (MRD). Subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis was found to be responsible for MRD after treatment. Patient xenograft mouse models are valuable tools for studying MRD after chemotherapy; however, the contribution of the immune system in these models is usually missing. To evaluate its role in leukemic persistence, we generated an immune-competent AML mouse model of persistence after chemotherapy treatment. We used well-characterized (phenotypically and genetically) subclones of the murine C1498 cell line stably expressing the ZsGreen reporter gene and the WT1 protein, a valuable antigen. Accordingly, these subclones were also selected due to their in vitro aracytidine (Ara-c) sensitivity. A combination of 3 subclones (expressing or not expressing WT1) was found to lead to prolonged mouse survival after Ara-c treatment (as long as 150 days). The presence of residual leukemic cells in the blood and BM of surviving mice indicated their persistence. Thus, a new mouse model that may offer insights into immune contributions to leukemic persistence was developed."

Late presentation is a major risk factor for glaucoma induced blindness. The aim of this study was to assess determinants for late presentation of glaucoma among adult glaucomatous patients.A hospital-based case-control study was conducted among 452 adult glaucomatous patients. Late presenters were glaucoma patients diagnosed with cup to disc ratio (CDR) > 0.8 and mean deviation of greater than -14 decibel in either of the eyes at their first presentation. Study participants were selected among glaucomatous follow-up patients by using systematic random sampling. Data were entered into EPI Info version 7 and exported to SPSS version 22 for analysis. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to identify determinants. Variables with P-value < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant.The mean age of participants were 55.1 ± 13.2 years. Being > 60 years of age, 4.51 times (AOR: 4.51; 95% CI: 1.74, 11.67), resided > 53 km away from the hospital 6.02 times (AOR: 6.02; 2.76, 13.14), Presenting IOP > 30 mmHg, 4.49 times (AOR: 4.49, 95% CI: 2.10, 9.12), poor knowledge of glaucoma, 4.46 times (AOR: 4.46, CI: 2.62, 7.58) and absence of regular eye checkup, 2.35 times (AOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.09, 5.47) higher odds of being late presenter.Increasing age, high IOP, poor knowledge of glaucoma, residing far away from the hospital and absence of regular eye checkups were significantly associated with late presentation."
https://openalex.org/W4225164089,"Aminoglycoside antibiotics interfere with the selection of cognate tRNAs during translation, resulting in the synthesis of aberrant proteins that are the ultimate cause of cell death. However, the toxic potential of aberrant proteins and how they avoid degradation by the cell’s protein quality control (QC) machinery are not understood. Here we report that levels of the heat shock (HS) transcription factor σ32 increased sharply following exposure of Escherichia coli to the aminoglycoside kanamycin (Kan), suggesting that at least some of the aberrant proteins synthesized in these cells were recognized as substrates by DnaK, a molecular chaperone that regulates the HS response, the major protein QC pathway in bacteria. To further investigate aberrant protein toxic potential and interaction with cell QC factors, we studied an acutely toxic 48-residue polypeptide (ARF48) that is encoded by an alternate reading frame in a plant cDNA. As occurred in cells exposed to Kan, σ32 levels were strongly elevated following ARF48 expression, suggesting that ARF48 was recognized as a substrate by DnaK. Paradoxically, an internal 10-residue region that was tightly bound by DnaK in vitro also was required for the ARF48 toxic effect. Despite the increased levels of σ32, levels of several HS proteins were unchanged following ARF48 expression, suggesting that the HS response had been aborted. Nucleoids were condensed and cell permeability increased rapidly following ARF48 expression, together suggesting that ARF48 disrupts DNA-membrane interactions that could be required for efficient gene expression. Our results are consistent with earlier studies showing that aberrant proteins induced by aminoglycoside antibiotics disrupt cell membrane integrity. Insights into the mechanism for this effect could be gained by further study of the ARF48 model system."
https://openalex.org/W4225165275,"Mammary gland is present in all mammals and usually functions in producing milk to feed the young offspring. Mammogenesis refers to the growth and development of mammary gland, which begins at puberty and ends after lactation. Pregnancy is regulated by various cytokines, which further contributes to mammary gland development. Epithelial cells, including basal and luminal cells, are one of the major components of mammary gland cells. The development of basal and luminal cells has been observed to significantly differ at different stages. However, the underlying mechanisms for differences between basal and luminal cells have not been fully studied. To explore the mechanisms underlying the differentiation of mammary progenitors or their offspring into luminal and myoepithelial cells, the single-cell sequencing data on mammary epithelia cells of virgin and pregnant mouse was deeply investigated in this work. We evaluated features by using Monte Carlo feature selection and plotted the incremental feature selection curve with support vector machine or RIPPER to find the optimal gene features and rules that can divide epithelial cells into four clusters with different cell subtypes like basal and luminal cells and different phases like pregnancy and virginity. As representations, the feature genes Cldn7, Gjb6, Sparc, Cldn3, Cited1, Krt17, Spp1, Cldn4, Gjb2 and Cldn19 might play an important role in classifying the epithelial mammary cells. Notably, seven most important rules based on the combination of cell-specific and tissue-specific expressions of feature genes effectively classify the epithelial mammary cells in a quantitative and interpretable manner."
https://openalex.org/W4225166136,"The efficacy and safety of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in multiple sclerosis (MS) are well known; however, owing to their high costs, determining real-world outcomes is essential to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to investigate the variability in the annual cost of DMTs associated with a relapse-free patient in a representative population cohort of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and whether this could serve as an appropriate health indicator.We analyzed the patients followed up in our MS clinic during the years 2016 and 2019, and selected patients belonging to our health district diagnosed with RRMS. The treatment cost associated with a relapse-free patient was the ratio between the total cost of DMTs and the number of relapse-free patients, treated and not treated, during the year of the study.A total of 158 patients with RRMS in 2016 and 183 in 2019 were included in our study. In 2016, 101 patients with RRMS (63.9%) received treatment with DMTs and 120 patients (75.9%) remained relapse-free. The mean cost of DMTs per patient in 2016 was €7414.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6325.2-8503.4) considering all the patients (treated and not treated). In 2019, 126 patients (68.9%) received DMTs and 151 patients (82.5%) remained relapse-free. The mean cost of DMTs per patient in 2019 was €6985.4 (95% CI: 5986.9-7983.9) considering all the patients. The cost per year of DMTs to achieve a relapse-free patient was €9762.2 in 2016 and €8465.8 in 2019.The treatment cost per year to achieve a relapse-free patient was stable during successive measurements in the same population. Therefore, it may be considered a good real-world health indicator for patients with RRMS treated with DMTs."
