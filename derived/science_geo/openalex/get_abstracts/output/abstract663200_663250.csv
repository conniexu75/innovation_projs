https://openalex.org/W3101992496,"Changing with the times Pandemic spread of a virus in naïe populations can select for mutations that alter pathogenesis, virulence, and/or transmissibility. The ancestral form of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged from China has now been largely replaced by strains containing the mutation D614G (Asp 614 -to-Gly) in the viral spike protein. Hou et al. compared the characteristics of the new variant against the ancestral form in a series of experiments in human cells and animal models. The variant is better at infecting upper-airway epithelial cells and replicates in greater numbers than the ancestral virus. Evidence indicates modest, if any, significant changes to virulence in animal models. Therefore, the virus appears to have evolved for greater transmissibility in humans rather than for greater pathogenicity. The mutation renders the new virus variant more susceptible to neutralizing antisera without altering the efficacy of vaccine candidates currently under development. Science , this issue p. 1464"

However, very little information is currently available about the abundance, phenotype, functional capacity and fate of pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses during the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we define a set of optimal and dominant SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes. We also perform a high-resolution ex vivo analysis of pre-existing and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, applying peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHCI) tetramer technology. We observe rapid induction, prolonged contraction and emergence of heterogeneous and functionally competent cross-reactive and induced memory CD8+ T cell responses in cross-sectionally analyzed individuals with mild disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection and three individuals longitudinally assessed for their T cells pre- and post-SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8+ T cells exhibited functional characteristics comparable to influenza-specific CD8+ T cells and were detectable in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals who were seronegative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies targeting spike (S) and nucleoprotein (N). These results define cross-reactive and induced SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell responses as potentially important determinants of immune protection in mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functionally competent memory CD8+ T cells specific for different viral epitopes are induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and can be detected in the absence of virus-specific antibodies."

We formally link these domains, provide a mechanistic understanding of the hippocampal role in generalization, and offer unifying principles underlying many entorhinal and hippocampal cell types. We propose medial entorhinal cells form a basis describing structural knowledge, and hippocampal cells link this basis with sensory representations. Adopting these principles, we introduce the Tolman-Eichenbaum machine (TEM). After learning, TEM entorhinal cells display diverse properties resembling apparently bespoke spatial responses, such as grid, band, border, and object-vector cells. TEM hippocampal cells include place and landmark cells that remap between environments. Crucially, TEM also aligns with empirically recorded representations in complex non-spatial tasks. TEM also generates predictions that hippocampal remapping is not random as previously believed; rather, structural knowledge is preserved across environments.

Humans and other animals make complex inferences from sparse observations and rapidly integrate new knowledge to control their behavior. Tolman, 1948Tolman E.C. Cognitive maps in rats and men.Psychol. Rev. 1948; 55: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (3663) Google Scholar argued that these facilities rely on a systematic organization of knowledge called a cognitive map. In the hippocampal formation, during spatial tasks, individual neurons appear precisely tuned to bespoke features of this mapping problem (O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978O’Keefe J. Nadel L. The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. Oxford University Press, 1978Google Scholar; Taube et al., 1990Taube J.S. Muller R.U. Ranck Jr., J.B.

Microstructure of a spatial map in the entorhinal cortex.Nature. 2005; 436: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (2432) Google Scholar). However, the hippocampus is also critical for non-spatial inferences that rely on understanding the relationships or associations between objects and events termed relational memory (Cohen and Eichenbaum, 1993Cohen N.J. Eichenbaum H. Memory, Amnesia, and the Hippocampal System. MIT Press, 1993Google Scholar). While it has been suggested that relational memory and spatial reasoning might be related by a common mechanism (Eichenbaum and Cohen, 2014Eichenbaum H. Cohen N.J. Can we reconcile the declarative memory and spatial navigation views on hippocampal function?.Neuron. 2014; 83: 764-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether such a mechanism exists or how it could account for the diverse array of apparently bespoke spatial cell types. One promising approach casts spatial and non-spatial problems as a connected graph, with neural responses as efficient representations of this graph (Gustafson and Daw, 2011Gustafson N.J. Daw N.D.

Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This has led to new potential interpretations for place cells (Stachenfeld et al., 2017Stachenfeld K.L.K.L. Botvinick M.M. Gershman S.J. The hippocampus as a predictive map.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 1643-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) and grid cells (Stachenfeld et al., 2017Stachenfeld K.L.K.L.

Derdikman D. Extracting grid cell characteristics from place cell inputs using non-negative principal component analysis.eLife. 2016; 5: e10094Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, such approaches cannot account for the rapid inferences and generalizations characteristic of hippocampal function in both spatial and relational memory and do not explain the myriad types of spatial representations observed or predict how they will change across different environments (remapping). We aim to account for this broad set of hippocampal properties by re-casting both spatial and relational memory problems as examples of structural abstraction (Kemp and Tenenbaum, 2008Kemp C. Tenenbaum J.B. The discovery of structural form.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 10687-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) and generalization (Figures 1A–1C and S1). Spatial reasoning can be cast as structural generalization, as different spatial environments share the common regularities of Euclidean space that define which inferences can be made, and which shortcuts might exist. For example, moving south→east→north→west will return you to where you started. Structural regularities also permit inferences in non-spatial relational problems. For example, transitive inference problems (which depend on the hippocampus [Bunsey and Eichenbaum, 1996Bunsey M. Eichenbaum H. Conservation of hippocampal memory function in rats and humans.Nature. 1996; 379: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar; Dusek and Eichenbaum, 1997Dusek J.A. Eichenbaum H. The hippocampus and memory for orderly stimulus relations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar]) require stimuli to be represented on an abstract ordered line, such that A>B and B>C implies A>C. Similarly, abstraction of hierarchical structure permits rapid inferences when encountering new social situations.Figure S1Task Schematics for TEM, Related to Figures 1 and 3Show full caption(A) Learning to predict the next sensory observation in environments that share the same structure but differ in their sensory observations.

Structural generalization offers dramatic benefits for new learning and flexible inference and is a key issue in artificial intelligence. One promising approach is to maintain “factorized” representations in which different aspects of knowledge are represented separately and can then be flexibly re-combined to represent novel experiences (Higgins et al., 2017Higgins I. Matthey L. Pal A. Burgess C. Glorot X. Botvinick M. Mohamed S. Lerchner A. βVAE: Learning basic visual concepts with a constrained variational framework. International Conference on Learning Representations 0.2017Google Scholar). Factorizing the relationships between experiences from the content of each experience could offer a powerful mechanism for generalizing this structural knowledge to new situations. Notably, exactly such a factorization exists between sensory and spatial representations in lateral (LEC) and medial (MEC) entorhinal cortices, respectively (Manns and Eichenbaum, 2006Manns J.R. Eichenbaum H. Evolution of declarative memory.Hippocampus. 2006; 16: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Manns and Eichenbaum, 2006Manns J.R. Eichenbaum H. Evolution of declarative memory.Hippocampus. 2006; 16: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar propose that novel conjunctions of these two representations form the hippocampal representation for relational memory. We demonstrate that this factorization and conjunction approach is sufficient to build a relational memory system (the Tolman-Eichenbaum machine [TEM]) that generalizes structural knowledge in space and non-space, predicts a broad range of neuronal representations observed in spatial and relational memory tasks, and accounts for observed remapping phenomena in both the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Notably, although hippocampal remapping is thought to be random, TEM predicts that this apparent randomness hides a structural representation that is preserved across environments. We verify this prediction in simultaneously recorded place and grid cells and show that suggested differences between spatial and non-spatial hippocampal remapping can be explained by this same mechanism. These results suggest a general framework for hippocampal-entorhinal representation, inference, and generalization across spatial and non-spatial tasks. We consider the unsupervised learning problem where an agent must predict the next sensory experience in a sequence derived from probabilistic transitions on graphs (Figure 1D). The agent does not see the graph, only a sequence of sensory observations and the “relation” or “action” that caused each transition (a transition is a jump between adjacent nodes of the graph). Different types of relation exist, e.g., in a family hierarchy, parent, aunt, child, and nephew imply different transitions on the graph, but each transition-type has the same meaning at every point on the graph. Similarly, in space, action is defined by heading direction (e.g., NESW on 4-connected graphs). If all transitions have been experienced, the graph can be stored in memory and perfect predictions made without any structural abstraction. However, if structural properties of the graph are known a priori, perfect prediction is possible long before all transitions have been experienced; it only requires each node to have been experienced (Figures 1H and 1I). This can be easily understood; when the structure of the graph is known, a new node can be introduced with a single relation (Bob has a daughter, Emily; Figure 1E) and all other relations can immediately be inferred (Emily is Alice’s granddaughter and Cat’s niece, etc.). Similarly, in space, if the structure of 2D graphs is known, then placing a new node on an X-Y coordinate is sufficient to infer relational information to every other point on the graph (Figure 1F). In summary, after experiencing many graphs with different sensory observations and learning their common relational structure, the goal of our unsupervised learning agent is to maximize its ability to predict the next sensory observation after each transition on a new graph (Figure 1G). To build a machine that solves this problem, we first consider a normative solution. This is formalized as a generative model and its approximate Bayesian inversion, described in the STAR Methods. Here, we describe the key elements of this solution and their proposed mapping onto the functional anatomy of the hippocampal system. We want to estimate the probability of the next sensory observation given all previous observations on this and all other graphs. A parsimonious solution will reflect the fact that each task is composed of two factors, a graph-structure and sensory observations (Figure 2A). If you know the relational structure, you can know where you are even when taking paths that have not been previously experienced—a form of path integration but for arbitrary graphs (Figure 2B). Knowing where you are though is not enough for successful predictions—you also need to remember what you have seen and where you saw it. Such relational memories bind sensory observations to locations in the relational structure (Figure 2C). With these two components, sensory prediction becomes easy—path integration tells you where you are and relational memories tell you what’s there. If these components are separated, generalization is also easy; each world has the same underlying relational structure but with a different configuration of sensory observations, thus understanding a new world is simply a problem of relational memory. More formally, to facilitate generalization of knowledge across domains we separate variables of abstract location that generalize across maps (g, general, grid cells) from those that are grounded in sensory experience and therefore specific to a particular map (p, particular, place cells). Although p and g are variables, they are each represented as a population (vector) of units in a neural network. The problem is therefore reduced to learning neural network weights (W) that know how to (1) represent locations in relational structures (g) and (2) form relational memories (p), store them (M), and later retrieve them. Although the weights of the network are learned, we are able to make critical choices in its architecture. The resulting network maps simply onto the functional anatomy of the hippocampal formation and its computations and can be intuitively represented in schematics (Figure 2D). Following Manns and Eichenbaum, 2006Manns J.R. Eichenbaum H. Evolution of declarative memory.Hippocampus. 2006; 16: 795-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, hippocampal representations, (p), are a conjunction between sensory input (x) in the LEC and abstract location (g) in the MEC. By mirroring hippocampal synaptic potentiation (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993Bliss T. Collingridge G. A synaptic model of memory: long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9539) Google Scholar), memories are able to be rapidly stored in weights (M) between p using simple Hebbian learning between co-active neurons and retrieved by the natural attractor dynamics of the resultant auto-associative network (Figure 2D). To infer a new g representation, TEM performs path integration from the previous g, conditional on the current action/relation. This can be related to recurrent neural network models (RNNs) of place and grid cells (Zhang, 1996Zhang K. Representation of spatial orientation by the intrinsic dynamics of the head-direction cell ensemble: a theory.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2112-2126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Burak and Fiete, 2009Burak Y. Fiete I.R. Accurate path integration in continuous attractor network models of grid cells.PLoS Comput. Biol. 2009; 5: e1000291Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Like these models, different recurrent weights mediate the effects of different actions/relations in changing the activity pattern in the network (Figure 2D). Unlike these models, however, weights are learnt from sensory experience, allowing map-like abstractions and path integration to extend to arbitrary non-spatial problems. Path integration accumulates errors (Mittelstaedt and Mittelstaedt, 1980Mittelstaedt M.L. Mittelstaedt H. Homing by path integration in a mammal.Naturwissenschaften. 1980; 67: 566-567Crossref Scopus (480) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, TEM can take advantage of a second source of information about g, the conjunctive representations, p, stored in the hippocampal memory M. TEM indexes M with the current sensory experience, x, to retrieve a set of candidate representations of g (previously visited places with a similar sensory experience) and uses these to refine the path integrated g. When representing tasks that have self-repeating structure, it is efficient to organize cognitive maps hierarchically. To allow such hierarchy to emerge, we separate our model into multiple parallel streams, each as described above (i.e., each stream receives x, each stream’s g can transition via path integration and each stream’s p is a conjunction between its g and x [x is first temporally filtered independently for each stream; see STAR Methods]). These streams are only combined when forming and retrieving memories. When forming memories, connections, M, are also updated between active cells across streams in the hippocampus. When memories are retrieved, these same connections induce an attractor to retrieve p (see STAR Methods for details). The model’s sensory predictions are compared to sensory observations to provide an error signal. The network weights (W) are adjusted along a gradient that reduces these errors using backpropagation. In the artificial neural network model, network weights (W) differ from Hebbian weights (M). Network weights learn slowly, via backpropagation, to generalize across environments. Hebbian weights learn quickly, via Hebbian learning at every time step, to remember what is where in each environment. For aficionados, although this section describes the key elements, TEM can be framed as a generative model of graphs. This allows us to use modern Bayesian methods (Kingma and Welling, 2013Kingma D.P. Welling M. Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes.arXiv. 2013; (1312.61140)Google Scholar; Gemici et al., 2017Gemici M.

Generative Temporal Models with Memory.arXiv. 2017; (1702.046490)Google Scholar) to learn the network weights and perform inference on g and p. The full algorithm is detailed in the STAR Methods (Figures S2, S3, and S4).Figure S3Computations in TEM Generative Model, Related to Figure 2Show full captionThis shows each computation, as described in Generative architecture, making clear the fixed Wtile and Wrepeat matrices perform appropriate dimension changes, though we note that the matrices may not be the sole computation in each step.

We note that the matrices may not be the sole computation in each step. Red/Blue boxes describe two different ‘streams’. In the bottom left, we show that multiplying together the representation after the Wtile and Wrepeat operations is equivalent to an outer product. The model is trained in multiple different environments, differing in size and sensory experience. Different environments use the same network weights, W, for path integration, but different Hebbian weights, M, for memories. The most important weights are those that transition g as they encode the structure of the map. They must ensure (1) that each location in the map has a different g representation (so a unique memory can be built) and (2) that arriving at the same location after different actions causes the same g representation (so the same memory can be retrieved)—a form of path integration for arbitrary graph structures. For example, the relation “uncle” must cause the same change in g as father followed by brother but different from brother followed by father. To summarize, the network only sees sensory inputs x and the actions a at each time step. It must construct an internal representation of the environment. The g representations are a RNN; its recurrent weights define the learnt internal structure and each g representation (at a given time step) corresponding to a position in the map. When the RNN receives an action, it changes its representation, g. The aim is to make the RNN have the same representation on returning to the same point (path integration), so it can retrieve the correct memory, p. To do this, the network must implicitly learn the structure/rules of the environment. p binds a particular g representation to a particular sensory representation, x, and is stored for future recall in a set of weights, M. These weights are Hebbian and therefore change with every experience, whereas the RNN weights are fixed when the network is run and adjusted by backpropagation to minimize overall errors. We first test TEM on classic non-spatial relational memory tasks thought to depend on the hippocampus—transitive inference and social hierarchy tasks (Dusek and Eichenbaum, 1997Dusek J.A. Eichenbaum H. The hippocampus and memory for orderly stimulus relations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 7109-7114Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar; Kumaran et al., 2012Kumaran D. Melo H.L. Duzel E. The emergence and representation of knowledge about social and nonsocial hierarchies.Neuron. 2012; 76: 653-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). After training, TEM immediately makes inferences in new transitive inference tasks without any additional experience (Figure 3A) e.g., after being shown sequences such as A>B>C>D>E—regardless of particular sensory identities (e.g., A,B,C,D,E or cat,dog,elephant,fox,badger) - TEM returns “B” to the query “what is 3 more than E” (the query is an action a). Therefore, TEM has learned ordinal structural knowledge. Equally, in social hierarchy tasks, TEM can infer relationships that it has never seen (Figure 3B). For example, after being shown that “Bob is the brother of Cat who is Fran’s mother”, TEM answers “Fran” when queried “who is Bob’s niece?”. In both cases, TEM was able to answer correctly without having previously seen the particular sensory details of the task before as it had been exposed to similar relational structures from which it could learn from and generalize. Such first presentation inferences are only possible with learned structural knowledge. Knowing the underlying structure allows one to know the entire relational structure after a single visit to each state (Figures 1H and 1I). TEM demonstrates this data efficiency with its performance in line with the proportion of states visited in the graph, not the edges taken (Figures 3D and 3F). We also tested TEM on tasks with an underlying spatial structure (e.g., Figures 1F and 1H). Again, TEM performed first presentation inferences in spatial generalization tasks (Figure 3C)—only possible with both learned structural knowledge and long-term relational memories (Figure 3E). We now interrogate the network’s learned representations to understand how they relate to the computations required for these tasks, as well as known properties of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. We begin by considering TEM agents that diffuse randomly on 2D graphs, constrained only by the neighborhood transitions in the environment. Here, TEM’s “abstract location” (g) representations resemble grid cells (Figures 4A and 4B for hexagonal and square environments, respectively; Figures S5A–S5D for further cells) and band cells (Figure 4D) as recorded in rodent MEC (Hafting et al., 2005Hafting T.

By monitoring changes in the color and intensity in both elastomer-based fibers, the researchers could distinguish bending, stretching, and localized pressing with a spatial resolution down to ∼1 centimeter.

https://openalex.org/W3106117005,"Abstract Cortical neurons exhibit extreme diversity in gene expression as well as in morphological and electrophysiological properties 1,2 . Most existing neural taxonomies are based on either transcriptomic 3,4 or morpho-electric 5,6 criteria, as it has been technically challenging to study both aspects of neuronal diversity in the same set of cells 7 . Here we used Patch-seq 8 to combine patch-clamp recording, biocytin staining, and single-cell RNA sequencing of more than 1,300 neurons in adult mouse primary motor cortex, providing a morpho-electric annotation of almost all transcriptomically defined neural cell types. We found that, although broad families of transcriptomic types (those expressing Vip , Pvalb , Sst and so on) had distinct and essentially non-overlapping morpho-electric phenotypes, individual transcriptomic types within the same family were not well separated in the morpho-electric space. Instead, there was a continuum of variability in morphology and electrophysiology, with neighbouring transcriptomic cell types showing similar morpho-electric features, often without clear boundaries between them. Our results suggest that neuronal types in the neocortex do not always form discrete entities. Instead, neurons form a hierarchy that consists of distinct non-overlapping branches at the level of families, but can form continuous and correlated transcriptomic and morpho-electrical landscapes within families."

https://openalex.org/W3105214972,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) associate with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to direct widespread posttranscriptional gene repression. Although association with AGO typically protects miRNAs from nucleases, extensive pairing to some unusual target RNAs can trigger miRNA degradation. We found that this target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) required the ZSWIM8 Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase. This and other findings support a mechanistic model of TDMD in which target-directed proteolysis of AGO by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway exposes the miRNA for degradation. Moreover, loss-of-function studies indicated that the ZSWIM8 Cullin-RING ligase accelerates degradation of numerous miRNAs in cells of mammals, flies, and nematodes, thereby specifying the half-lives of most short-lived miRNAs. These results elucidate the mechanism of TDMD and expand its inferred role in shaping miRNA levels in bilaterian animals."
https://openalex.org/W3099719836,"Turning the tables on microRNA decay MicroRNAs help to regulate many genes in animal cells. Each microRNA associates with an Argonaute (AGO) protein, forming a complex in which the microRNA pairs with a messenger RNA (mRNA) target and AGO recruits factors that accelerate mRNA decay. However, for some unusual targets, the reverse occurs: Pairing to the target recruits factors that accelerate microRNA decay rather than degradation of the mRNA. Working independently, Shi et al. and Han et al. elucidate the mechanism of this phenomenon. They found that pairing to the unusual targets recruits a ubiquitin ligase that causes degradation of AGO, thereby exposing the microRNA to cellular nucleases. Mutating the ubiquitin ligase in diverse animals and cell types deregulates numerous microRNAs, implying that this phenomenon is widely deployed to sculpt microRNA levels.

These properties make cysteine attractive as a component of prebiotic chemistry, but traditional Strecker synthesis of α-aminonitriles, which can serve as peptide precursors, cannot produce free cysteine. Foden et al. found that a simple acylation of the free amine prevented degradation of cysteine nitrile and enabled synthesis of this cysteine precursor from acetyl dehydroalanine nitrile and a sulfide donor (see the Perspective by Muchowska and Moran).

The studies presented here provide strong evidence that the neural circuits conveying mechanical allodynia in the dorsal horn differ by the nature of the injury. Calretinin (CR) neurons in lamina II inner convey mechanical allodynia induced by inflammatory injuries, while protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ) neurons at the lamina II/III border convey mechanical allodynia induced by neuropathic injuries. Cholecystokinin (CCK) neurons located deeper within the dorsal horn (laminae III-IV) are important for both types of injuries. Interestingly, the Maf+ subset of CCK neurons is composed of transient vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (tVGLUT3) neurons, which convey primarily dynamic allodynia. Identification of an etiology-based circuitry for mechanical allodynia in the dorsal horn has important implications for the mechanistic and clinical understanding of this condition."

How interneurons (INs) in the dorsal horn encode these modalities and transform them into stimulus-appropriate motor behaviors is not known. Here, we use an intersectional genetic approach to functionally assess the contribution that eight classes of dorsal excitatory INs make to sensorimotor reflex responses. We demonstrate that the dorsal horn is organized into spatially restricted excitatory modules composed of molecularly heterogeneous cell types. Laminae I/II INs drive chemical itch-induced scratching, laminae II/III INs generate paw withdrawal movements, and laminae III/IV INs modulate dynamic corrective reflexes. These data reveal a key principle in spinal somatosensory processing, namely, sensorimotor reflexes are driven by the differential spatial recruitment of excitatory neurons."

We included 48 TBM patients (median age 30, 52% female, 8% HIV-infected), most of whom had grade II (90%), bacteriologically confirmed (71%) disease, without antituberculotic resistance. Most patients had more than one brain lesion (83%); baseline MRIs showed meningeal enhancement (89%), tuberculomas (77%), brain infarction (60%) and hydrocephalus (56%). We also performed an exploratory analysis associating MRI findings to clinical parameters, response to treatment, paradoxical reactions and survival.

However, the reliance on radioactive components, large sample volumes and limited throughput renders radioassay testing costly and challenging. We developed a multiplex analysis platform based on antibody detection by agglutination-PCR (ADAP) for the sample-sparing measurement of GAD, IA-2 and insulin autoantibodies/antibodies in 1 μL serum. The assay was developed and validated in 7 distinct cohorts (n = 858) with the majority of the cohorts blinded prior to analysis. Measurements from the ADAP assay were compared to radioassay to determine correlation, concordance, agreement, clinical sensitivity and specificity. The average overall agreement between ADAP and radioassay was above 91%. The average clinical sensitivity and specificity were 96% and 97%. In the IASP 2018 workshop, ADAP achieved the highest sensitivity of all assays tested at 95% specificity (AS95) rating for GAD and IA-2 autoantibodies and top-tier performance for insulin autoantibodies. Furthermore, ADAP correctly identified 95% high-risk individuals with two or more autoantibodies by radioassay amongst 39 relatives of T1D patients tested. In conclusion, the new ADAP assay can reliably detect the three cardinal islet autoantibodies/antibodies in 1μL serum with high sensitivity. This novel assay may improve pediatric testing compliance and facilitate easier community-wide screening for islet autoantibodies."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as essential inflammation regulators. We identify a novel lncRNA termed lncRNA-MAP3K4 that is enriched in the vessel wall and regulates vascular inflammation. In the aortic intima, lncRNA-MAP3K4 expression was reduced by 50% during the progression of atherosclerosis (chronic inflammation) and 70% during endotoxemia (acute inflammation). lncRNA-MAP3K4 knockdown reduced the expression of key inflammatory factors (eg, ICAM-1, E-selectin, MCP-1) in endothelial cells or vascular smooth muscle cells and decreased monocytes adhesion to endothelium, as well as reducing TNF-α, IL-1β, COX2 expression in macrophages. Mechanistically, lncRNA-MAP3K4 regulates inflammation through the p38 MAPK signaling pathway. lncRNA-MAP3K4 shares a bidirectional promoter with MAP3K4, an upstream regulator of the MAPK signaling pathway, and regulates its transcription in cis. lncRNA-MAP3K4 and MAP3K4 show coordinated expression in response to inflammation in vivo and in vitro. Similar to lncRNA-MAP3K4, MAP3K4 knockdown reduced the expression of inflammatory factors in several different vascular cells. Furthermore, lncRNA-MAP3K4 and MAP3K4 knockdown showed cooperativity in reducing inflammation in endothelial cells.

Consequently, the demand for cooling will intensify, driven by climate change as well as improving economic conditions. Cooling requirements for data centers and new technologies may also call for innovative solutions. Developing a wide array of cooling strategies will be vital for human comfort and prevention of heat-induced medical emergencies. A growing number of materials and methods are being designed to improve technologies, meet the temperature needs of data centers and other facilities, and reduce harmful emissions.

Vapor compression systems supply much of the residential and industrial cooling infrastructure. These systems rely on compressing gases, many of which contribute to the greenhouse effect if released into the atmosphere. Finding replacements is a priority but requires balancing trade-offs between toxicity, flammability, and lower efficiency. An alternative approach involves the use of caloric materials—i.e., solids that effectively pump heat as they are electrically, magnetically, or mechanically manipulated.

A completely different cooling strategy is to use materials that regulate heat in the form of infrared radiation. Passive radiative cooling materials take advantage of an atmosphere window for infrared radiation to eject heat into space. When deployed on rooftops, these systems can potentially cool buildings by a few degrees, even in the daytime. Along the same lines, textiles may be modified so that heat can more efficiently radiate through them, allowing people to be more comfortable at higher thermostat set points.

As the planet warms, keeping cool without increasing greenhouse gas emissions will be a challenge, but new materials and technologies are poised to meet this goal."

Podocytes constitute an important component of glomerular filtration, and high basal autophagy is indispensable for podocyte function. The current study aimed to analyze the relationship between sPLA2-IB and podocyte autophagy in IMN and determine whether sPLA2-IB mediates abnormal autophagy regulation in podocytes. The serum sPLA2-IB level and podocyte autophagy were detected, and clinical data were collected from IMN patients with different proteinuria levels. Then, the effects of sPLA2-IB on autophagy signaling pathways were evaluated in cultured human podocytes treated with sPLA2-IB, rapamycin, p38 inhibition, and PLA2R-siRNA in vitro. We found that IMN patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria have a significantly higher level of sPLA2-IB and fewer autophagosomes than those with non-nephrotic-range proteinuria. In vitro sPLA2-IB-induced insufficient autophagy in podocytes and promoted podocyte injury via activation of the mTOR/ULK1ser757 signaling pathway. Moreover, inhibition of p38 MAPK evidently abrogated sPLA2-IB-induced autophagy and the activation of mTOR/ULK1ser757 . Additionally, PLA2R silencing demonstrated that sPLA2-IB-induced abnormal autophagy was also PLA2R-dependent. In conclusion, the results revealed that sPLA2-IB downregulated autophagy and contributed to podocyte injury via PLA2R though activation of the p38MAPK/mTOR/ULK1ser757 signaling pathway."

Design Retrospective cross-sectional study Participants Data of 22,948 participants of the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 2013–2015 were used. Outcome measures Participants were asked if they had OA pain in the hip joint, knee joint, and lower back (yes/no) and whether they experienced anxiety or depression. The EQ-5D questionnaire was used to determine the quality of life of patients with hip, knee, and lower back OA. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed after adjusting. Results A total of 5,401 patients reported pain in the hip joint, knee joint, or lower back. The analysis showed significant relations between pain sites, mental health, and quality of life. First, more female patients with OA experienced stress and depression than males. Second, for males with OA, stress was reported in the order of: lower back &gt; hip &gt; knee, while pain and depression was reported in the order of: lower back &gt; knee &gt; hip ( p &lt; 0.05). For females with OA, stress was reported in the order of: knee &gt; lower back &gt; hip, while depression was reported in the order of: knee &gt; lower back &gt; hip. Third, considering quality of life, for males, hip joint pain had the greatest impact on quality of life and for females, knee joint pain had the largest impact ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions For patients with OA, the effect on the mental health and quality of life differed according to sex and sites of pain. Therefore, this study confirms that pain sites, sex, mental health, and quality of life are independent risk factors when determining OA pain."

Our study aimed to determine the trends of seroprevalence of HIV/syphilis co-infection and syphilis infection overtime through the national surveillance system in Cameroon and to explore associated risk factors. Methods We conducted cross-sectional studies of HIV and syphilis, targeting each year 7000 first antenatal care (ANC-1) attendees at the same sites during the 2009, 2012 and 2017 sentinel surveillance surveys. Pregnant women were enrolled at their ANC-1, sociodemographic and clinical information were collected. HIV and Syphilis test were performed by serial algorithm as per the national guidelines. Trends were assessed for HIV, syphilis and HIV/syphilis by estimating seroprevalence from cross-sectional studies. Associated risk factors were explored using multinomial logistic regression with 4 outcomes: HIV/syphilis co-infection, HIV infection only, syphilis infection only and no infection. Results Overall, 6 632, 6 521 and 6 859 pregnant women were enrolled in 2009, 2012 and 2017 respectively. In 2017, a total of 3 901 pregnant women enrolled were tested for syphilis. Almost half of them (47.9%) were living in urban area and were aged less than 25 years (44.7%). While HIV epidemic was on a decline (from 7.6% (95% CI: 6.99–8.28) in 2009 to 5.7% (95% CI: 4.93–6.4) in 2017), a huge significant increase of syphilis prevalence was observed (from 0.6% (95% CI:0.40–0.80) in 2009 to 5.7% (95% CI:4.93–6.40) in 2017). Pregnant women residing in rural areas were more likely to be infected with syphilis than those living in the urban area (aOR = 1.8 [95% CI: 1.3–2.4]). Unmarried pregnant women were three time more likely to be infected by HIV/Syphilis Co-infection than married, cohabiting, widow or divorced pregnant women (aOR = 2.8 [95% CI: 1.3–2.4]). Furthermore; living in Northern region was associated with a lower risk of being infected with HIV (aOR = 0.6 [95% CI: 0.5–0.9]) and Syphilis infection (aOR = 0.6 [95% CI: 0.4–0.9]). Conclusion The epidemiological dynamics of syphilis suggests a growing burden of syphilis infection in the general population of Cameroon. Our findings support the fact that while emphasizing strategies to fight HIV, huge efforts should also be made for strategies to prevent and fight syphilis infection especially among HIV positive women, in rural area, and southern regions."

TM stem cells reside in a discrete location of the superior TM and generate long-lived clones and committed progenitors (CPs). CP clones exhibit lateral migration, and their proliferative capacity is supported by Pdgfra+ fibroblasts, generating migratory but non-proliferative progeny.

Loss of CL caused a rapid drop in ATP levels and a decline in the ΔΨm. Unbiased proteomic analyses revealed a reduction in the levels of many mitochondrial proteins, most notably of Fo F1 -ATPase subunits and AOX, resulting in a strong decline of glycerol-3-phosphate-stimulated oxygen consumption. The changes in cellular respiration preceded the observed decrease in Fo F1 -ATPase stability, suggesting that the AOX-mediated ETC is the first pathway responding to the decline in CL.

We have recently discovered that TCR-induced calcineurin activates DAPK1, which interacts with TSC2 via its death domain and phosphorylates TSC2 via its kinase domain to mediate mTORC1 activation in CD8+ T cells. However, whether DAPK1 regulates CD8+ trafficking into tumors remains unclear. Here, using pharmacological inhibitor and genetic approaches, we found that like rapamycin, inhibition of DAPK1 activity led to enhanced expression of the homing receptors CD62L and CCR7. Deletion of either kinase domain or death domain in the T cell compartment reduced the T cell activation and maintained the expression of CD62L and CCR7. DAPK1-DD-deficient mice were more susceptible to tumor growth and deficiency of DAPK1 activity significantly reduced the migratory ability of CD8+ into the tumors.

In order to prevent the taxi and other road users from speed-related crash, previous studies have revealed contributors of demographic and driving operation affecting taxi speeding frequency. However, researches regarding road factors, and spatial effect are typically rare. For this sake, the current study explores the contributions of 10 types of road characteristics and two kinds of spatial effects (spatial correlation and spatial heterogeneity) on taxi total speeding and serious speeding frequency. Taxi GPS trajectory data in a Chinese metropolis were used to identify speeding event. The study then established four kinds of Bayesian hierarchical count models base on Poisson and negative binominal distribution to estimate the contributor impacts, respectively. Results show that Bayesian hierarchical spatial Poisson log-linear model is optimum for fitting both total and serious speeding frequency. For the analysis, it is found that drivers are more likely to commit speeding on long multilane road with median strip, and road with non-motorized vehicle lane, bus-only lane and viaduct or road tunnel. Roads with low speed limit, and work zone are associated with increasing speeding as well. In terms of serious speeding, bus-only lane is not a contributor, while road speed camera number and one-way organization are significantly positive to the speeding frequency. Furthermore, it reveals that two spatial effects significantly increase the occurrence of speeding events; the impact of spatial heterogeneity is more critical."

We evaluated the role of the Hmg2 sterol sensing domain (SSD) in mallostery, as well as the involvement of the highly conserved INSIG proteins. We show that the Hmg2 SSD is critical for regulated degradation of Hmg2 and required for mallosteric misfolding of GGPP as studied by in vitro limited proteolysis.

Mutant analyses indicated that SSD-mediated mallostery occurred prior to and independent of HRD-dependent ubiquitination. GGPP-dependent misfolding was still extant but occurred at a much slower rate in the absence of a functional SSD, indicating that the SSD facilitates a physiologically useful rate of GGPP response and implying that the SSD is not a binding site for GGPP. Nonfunctional SSD mutants allowed us to test the importance of Hmg2 quaternary structure in mallostery: a nonresponsive Hmg2 SSD mutant strongly suppressed regulation of a coexpressed, normal Hmg2.

GGPP-dependent misfolding was still extant but occurred at a much slower rate in the absence of a functional SSD, indicating that the SSD facilitates a physiologically useful rate of GGPP response and implying that the SSD is not a binding site for GGPP. Nonfunctional SSD mutants allowed us to test the importance of Hmg2 quaternary structure in mallostery: a nonresponsive Hmg2 SSD mutant strongly suppressed regulation of a coexpressed, normal Hmg2. Finally, we have found that GGPP-regulated misfolding occurred in detergent-solubilized Hmg2, a feature that will allow next-level analysis of the mechanism of this novel tactic of ligand-regulated misfolding. Endoplasmic reticulum(ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) refers to a conserved set of degradation pathways that detect and degrade misfolded, unassembled, and damaged ER-resident proteins (1Needham P.G. Brodsky J.L. How early studies on secreted and membrane protein quality control gave rise to the ER associated degradation (ERAD) pathway: the early history of ERAD.Biochim. Biophys.

Ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation at the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2019; 93: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Both luminal (ERAD-L) and integral membrane (ERAD-M) proteins can be subject to ERAD. ERAD is initiated by the action of a surprisingly small set of conserved E3 ubiquitin ligases that each recognize a large range of substrates. The two major ERAD pathways in yeast—defined by the participant ligases—are the HRD (pronounced “herd”) pathway and the DOA (pronounced “dee-oh-ay”) pathway. The detailed structural features of an ERAD substrate that determine HRD- or DOA-dependent degradation are being unraveled and appear to encompass a large number of variations from wild-type stable configuration. Despite the large variety of possible substrates accommodated by each pathway, ERAD displays high specificity for misfolded versions of the proteins that undergo degradation, as would be required for an evolutionarily successful quality control pathway. In the course of our studies on the sterol synthetic pathway in yeast, we discovered that the HRD ERAD quality control pathway is also used to regulate levels of the normal, rate-limiting sterol synthetic enzyme HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) (5Hampton R.Y.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Specifically, the Hmg2 isozyme undergoes negative feedback regulation effected at the level of HRD-dependent degradation: the 20-carbon sterol pathway molecule geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) accelerates HRD-dependent degradation of Hmg2, thus allowing control over Hmg2 levels keyed to changing cellular demand for sterol pathway products. Interestingly, although the regulatory mechanisms are distinct, mammalian HMGR stability is also controlled in part by GGPP-mediated enhancement of degradation by ER-localized E3 ligases (8Schumacher M.M. Elsabrouty R. Seemann J. Jo Y. DeBose-Boyd R.A. The prenyltransferase UBIAD1 is the target of geranylgeraniol in degradation of HMG CoA reductase.Elife. 2015; 4e05560Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Like other quality control pathways, HRD-mediated ERAD is highly specific for misfolded versions of its many protein substrates. Our studies have revealed that the high selectivity of the HRD pathway for misfolded versions of substrates underlies HRD-dependent regulation of Hmg2 stability by GGPP: when GGPP levels are elevated, Hmg2 undergoes a reversible structural transition to a more misfolded form, allowing enhanced recognition and destruction by the HRD pathway and consequent lowering of Hmg2 activity. It appears that this mode of regulation by quality control has many examples throughout biology (9Song B.-L. Sever N. DeBose-Boyd R.A.

Furthermore, the presence of numerous degradative quality control pathways in all cellular compartments allows for the possibility of translational applications of regulated quality control in which small molecules that program quality control degradation of desired targets could be discovered and developed. Accordingly, we have devoted significant energy toward understanding the mechanisms at play in the GGPP-mediated enhancement of HRD-dependent Hmg2 degradation. We have employed a variety of approaches to observe that GGPP causes reversible misfolding of the Hmg2 protein to enhance HRD-dependent Hmg2 degradation (17Garza R.M. Tran P.N. Hampton R.Y.

Chem. 2011; 286: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Using both in vivo and in vitro methods, we found that the effects of GGPP on Hmg2 structure are remarkably similar to allosteric regulation. Because of these similarities, we have named this ligand-based misfolding “mallostery,” a portmanteau combining the ideas of misfolding with those of allosteric regulation to refer to this type of highly specific ligand-mediated misfolding (13Wangeline M.A. Vashistha N.

Chem. 2018; 293: 14937-14950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In our studies of mallostery, we built the case for the allosteric analogy in Hmg2-regulated degradation, showing high potency and structural specificity of GGPP, providing evidence of specific binding indicated by a close analog—GGSPP—that functions as a GGPP antagonist, and demonstrating that reversible misfolding is central to GGPP's role as an indicator of sterol pathway activity. In the studies below, we examined the in-cis features of Hmg2 regulation by GGPP, using a variety of Hmg2 mutants with highly specific lesions in degradative behavior to both explore the nature of ligand-mediated misfolding and further test the mallosteric model. We paid particular attention to the highly conserved sterol sensing domain (SSD), found in many proteins that pertain to sterol response, synthesis, or transport. The data indicated that the SSD functions as an autonomous motif to promote mallosteric misfolding. Furthermore, the mutants described in these studies allowed a strong test of the importance of the multimeric structure in ligand-regulated Hmg2 misfolding. Finally, we demonstrate that mallosteric regulation of Hmg2 can occur in detergent-solubilized Hmg2, setting the stage for next-level experiments to both understand and harness this highly specific regulatory strategy in both fundamental and translational endeavors. The SSD is a motif found in the multispanning membrane domains of many proteins that function in sterol synthesis, response, or regulation, including yeast Hmg2 (13Wangeline M.A. Vashistha N.

This highly conserved motif occurs in the intra- and juxta-membrane residues over five adjacent membrane-spanning alpha helices. Often, mutation of highly conserved SSD residues alters the regulatory or functional responses of SSD-containing proteins (19Theesfeld C.L. Pourmand D. Davis T. Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y.

Our previous work identified several conserved residues in the SSD of Hmg2 that are required for Hmg2-regulated degradation (Fig. 1A) (19Theesfeld C.L. Pourmand D. Davis T. Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y.

Chem. 2011; 286: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, all SSD mutations that caused changes in Hmg2 degradation, including mutation of the highly conserved S215 residue to A, produced increased stability over wild-type (19Theesfeld C.L. Pourmand D. Davis T. Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y.

Chem. 2011; 286: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), in contrast to the usual role of strongly conserved residues in permitting maximal stability. We had earlier noted that the S215A mutation also blocked the response to the putative regulatory ligand farnesol (FOH) in an in vitro limited proteolysis assay of Hmg2 structure. Later work demonstrated that the bona fide signal for Hmg2-regulated degradation is the highly potent, mallosteric regulator geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is effective at concentrations approximately 1000 times lower than FOH (18Wangeline M.A. Hampton R.Y. “Mallostery”—ligand-dependent protein misfolding enables physiological regulation by ERAD.J.

Accordingly, we examined the importance of these phenotypic, conserved SSD mutations on physiologically relevant, GGPP-induced reversible misfolding of Hmg2, using both in vivo and in vitro approaches. To study the role of the Hmg2 SSD in vivo and in vitro, we employed the Hmg2-GFP reporter, in which the C-terminal catalytic domain of Hmg2 is replaced by GFP (Fig. 1B). Hmg2-GFP lacks HMG-CoA reductase catalytic activity but undergoes quantitatively normal regulated degradation (18Wangeline M.A. Hampton R.Y. “Mallostery”—ligand-dependent protein misfolding enables physiological regulation by ERAD.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We focused on the mutants with the strongest phenotype from our earlier broad survey of this motif. The two mutants featured herein, S215A and L219F, each showed a loss of response to direct addition of the degradation signal GGPP to living cells. Both mutants were nonresponsive to GGPP addition compared with wild-type Hmg2-GFP (Fig. 1C). Similarly, both mutants displayed the expected strong stabilization after addition of cycloheximide, whereas the wild-type protein displayed a drop in steady-state levels due to degradation stimulated by the natural ambient concentration of GGPP (Fig. 1D) (19Theesfeld C.L. Pourmand D. Davis T. Garza R.M. Hampton R.Y.

Chem. 2011; 286: 26298-26307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This lack of degradation in response to GGPP can be further assayed by direct addition of GGPP to cells during cycloheximide chase to stimulate HRD-dependent Hmg2 degradation (18Wangeline M.A. Hampton R.Y. “Mallostery”—ligand-dependent protein misfolding enables physiological regulation by ERAD.J.

This confirmed that the GGPP-stimulated degradation showed the expected dependence on highly conserved SSD residues predicted from our earlier studies, allowing us to delve more deeply into the role of this motif in mallosteric control of Hmg2 folding. To that end, we employed a limited proteolysis assay of Hmg2, involving a myc-tagged version of Hmg2-GFP called 1mycL-Hmg2-GFP—developed early in our studies of regulated degradation—in our analysis of the SSD. The myc tag in 1mycL-Hmg2-GFP is present in the first luminal loop of Hmg2 and so is protected by the ER membrane, allowing detection of the protein and its cleavage products after proteolytic treatment of Hmg2 in isolated microsomes (Fig. 2A). Importantly, 1mycL-Hmg2-GFP is regulated normally (18Wangeline M.A. Hampton R.Y. “Mallostery”—ligand-dependent protein misfolding enables physiological regulation by ERAD.J. Biol.

Lipid-mediated, reversible misfolding of a sterol-sensing domain protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When microsomes prepared from strains expressing 1mycL-Hmg2-GFP are treated with limiting concentrations of trypsin, a characteristic pattern of cleavage fragments is produced that can be detected by blotting for the protected myc tag, an example being shown in Figure 2. When GGPP is included in the proteolysis assay, Hmg2 proteolysis occurs more rapidly (18Wangeline M.A. Hampton R.Y. “Mallostery”—ligand-dependent protein misfolding enables physiological regulation by ERAD.J.

Lipid-mediated, reversible misfolding of a sterol-sensing domain protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Only the rate at which the fragments are produced changes, not the pattern itself (27Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y.

Lipid-mediated, reversible misfolding of a sterol-sensing domain protein.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The highly stable S215A version of 1mycL-Hmg2-GFP did not respond to added GGPP at any concentration tested, even 2000-fold higher than that required to stimulate misfolding in the wild-type protein (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the stabilizing L219F mutation of that conserved SSD residue also blocked the response to GGPP in vitro (Fig. 2C). Thus, it appears that GGPP-dependent misfolding occurred by an SSD-dependent process. The SSD is perhaps best known for mediating sterol-dependent binding to the regulatory proteins known as INSIGs (insulin-stimulated genes). In many cases, an SSD–INSIG interaction underlies regulation that requires an SSD (13Wangeline M.A. Vashistha N. Hampton R.Y. Proteostatic tactics in the strategy of sterol regulation.Annu. Rev.

For example, mammalian HMGR requires SSD-mediated INSIG binding for sterol-regulated degradation (29Sever N. Yang T. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A.

Similarly, mammalian SCAP employs SSD-dependent INSIG binding to control the sterol-regulated trafficking that mediates sterol-based control of transcription (33Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E.

S. cerevisiae has two INSIG homologs called Nsg1 and Nsg2. Nsg1 binds to Hmg2 in a sterol-dependent manner that strongly inhibits its regulated degradation (31Flury I. Garza R. Shearer A. Rosen J. Cronin S. Hampton R.Y. INSIG: a broadly conserved transmembrane chaperone for sterol-sensing domain proteins.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3917-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Theesfeld C.L.

Chem. 2013; 288: 8519-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we wondered if the SSD-dependent, GGPP-stimulated degradation of Hmg2 was in any way dependent on either of the yeast INSIG homologs. Typically, we study Hmg2-regulated degradation at levels of Hmg2 in excess of native promoter-dependent Nsg expression (31Flury I. Garza R. Shearer A. Rosen J. Cronin S. Hampton R.Y. INSIG: a broadly conserved transmembrane chaperone for sterol-sensing domain proteins.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3917-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it was formally possible that the Nsgs were involved in SSD-dependent degradation of Hmg2, so we directly tested that possibility. Simultaneous deletion of Nsg1 and Nsg2 did not affect the steady-state level of Hmg2-GFP as measured by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A, left). Furthermore, Hmg2-GFP remained normally responsive to GGPP in nsg1Δnsg2Δ double null strains (Fig. 3A, right). As a control, we also tested whether INSIG deletion affected the strong acquired stability of the SSD mutant S215A. As expected, S215A Hmg2-GFP levels were unaffected by deletion of both INSIGS, and it remained stable and unresponsive to GGPP in the nsg1Δnsg2Δ strain (Fig. 3B, left and right, respectively). As expected from our earlier studies, expression of Nsg1 from the same strong promoter as that used for Hmg2-GFP, allowing stoichiometric interaction between the Nsg1 and Hmg2, increased the steady-state level of Hmg2-GFP (Fig. 3C, left) and blocked the degradation-stimulating effects of GGPP (Fig. 3C, right). We next confirmed that INSIGs were not required for the SSD-dependent response to GGPP using the in vitro proteolysis assay. When 1mycL-Hmg2-GFP was expressed in the nsg1Δnsg2Δ double null strain, it responded normally to GGPP (Fig. 3D, left). Conversely, the presence of high levels of Nsg1 completely blocked GGPP-dependent misfolding of 1myc-Hmg2-GFP (Fig. 3D, right). Taken together, these data suggest that yeast INSIGs were not required for SSD-dependent regulated Hmg2 misfolding, but instead blocked the function of the SSD by binding, which, as we have shown, occurs in a sterol-dependent manner (34Theesfeld C.L. Hampton R.Y. Insulin-induced gene protein (INSIG)-dependent sterol regulation of Hmg2 endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) in yeast.J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W3099596717,"Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most common valvular heart disease in adults. The cellular mechanisms of CAVD are still unknown, but accumulating evidence has revealed that osteogenic differentiation of human valve interstitial cells (hVICs) plays an important role in CAVD. Thus, we aimed to investigate the function of estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) in the osteogenic differentiation of hVICs. We found that the level of ERRα was significantly increased in CAVD samples compared to normal controls. In addition, ERRα was significantly upregulated during hVIC osteogenic differentiation in vitro. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments were performed to identify the function of ERRα in hVIC calcification in vitro. Inhibition of endogenous ERRα attenuated hVIC calcification, whereas overexpression of ERRα in hVICs promoted this process. RNA sequencing results suggested that heme oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) was a downstream target of ERRα, which was further confirmed by western blotting. Additionally, we also found that downregulation of Hmox1 by shHmox1 efficiently reversed the inhibition of calcification induced by ERRα shRNA in hVICs. ChIP-qPCR and luciferase assays indicated that Hmox1 was negatively regulated by ERRα. We found that overexpression of Hmox1 or its substrates significantly inhibited hVIC calcification in vitro. In conclusion, we found that knockdown of ERRα can inhibit hVIC calcification through upregulating Hmox1 and that ERRα and Hmox1 are potential targets for the treatment of CAVD."
https://openalex.org/W3105123167,"European canker, caused by the necrotrophic fungal phytopathogen Neonectria ditissima , is one of the most damaging apple diseases worldwide. An understanding of the molecular basis of N . ditissima virulence is currently lacking. Identification of genes with an up-regulation of expression during infection, which are therefore probably involved in virulence, is a first step towards this understanding. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) can be used to identify these candidate virulence genes, but relies on the use of reference genes for relative gene expression data normalisation. However, no report that addresses selecting appropriate fungal reference genes for use in the N . ditissima -apple pathosystem has been published to date. In this study, eight N . ditissima genes were selected as candidate RT-qPCR reference genes for gene expression analysis. A subset of the primers (six) designed to amplify regions from these genes were specific for N . ditissima , failing to amplify PCR products with template from other fungal pathogens present in the apple orchard. The efficiency of amplification of these six primer sets was satisfactory, ranging from 81.8 to 107.53%. Analysis of expression stability when a highly pathogenic N . ditissima isolate was cultured under 10 regimes, using the statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, indicated that actin and myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase ( mips ), or their combination, could be utilised as the most suitable reference genes for normalisation of N . ditissima gene expression. As a test case, these reference genes were used to study expression of three candidate virulence genes during a time course of infection. All three, which shared traits with fungal effector genes, had up-regulated expression in planta compared to in vitro with expression peaking between five and six weeks post inoculation (wpi). Thus, these three genes may well be involved in N . ditissima pathogenicity and are priority candidates for further functional characterization."
https://openalex.org/W3104692175,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus may result from insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Prokineticin receptor 1 (Prokr1) improves metabolic phenotype in adipose tissue and the cardiovascular system; however, its effects on skeletal muscle have not been investigated. We investigated the Prokr1 signaling pathways and its metabolic function in murine myoblast, satellite cells, and their differentiated myotubes. We measured the expression levels of Prokr1 in the skeletal muscle of mice as well as human skeletal muscle cell-derived myotubes. Prokineticin 2 (PROK2), a ligand of PROKR1, induced calcium mobilization in a dose-dependent manner and altered the mRNA levels of 578 genes in PROKR1-overexpressed HEK293T cells. Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes revealed that PROKR1 activated Gq-mediated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in skeletal muscle cells. Prokr1 significantly activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in myotubes derived from C2C12 and satellite cells, regardless of the presence or absence of insulin. Prokr1 also promoted the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) into the plasma membrane. In palmitate-induced insulin-resistant myotubes, Prokr1 enhanced insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake. mRNA and protein levels of Prokr1 were significantly decreased in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice, and the amount of PROKR1 protein was significantly decreased in human skeletal muscle cell-derived myotubes under insulin resistance conditions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Prokr1 plays an important role in insulin sensitivity and is a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate insulin resistance in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W3104768288,"The intestinal fatty acid binding protein (FABP) is a small protein expressed along the small intestine that bind long-chain fatty acids and other hydrophobic ligands. Several lines of evidence suggest that, once in the nucleus, it interacts with nuclear receptors, activating them and thus transferring the bound ligand into the nucleus. Previous work by our group suggests that FABP2 would participate in the cytoplasm-nucleus translocation of fatty acids. Because the consensus NLS is absent in the sequence of FABP2, we propose that a 3D signal could be responsible for its nuclear translocation. The results obtained by transfection assays of recombinant wild type and mutated forms of Danio rerio Fabp2 in Caco-2 cell cultures, showed that lysine 17, arginine 29 and lysine 30 residues, which are located in the helix-turn-helix region, would constitute a functional non-classical three-dimensional NLS."

https://openalex.org/W3097976768,"Dietary restriction (DR) increases life span and improves health in most model systems tested, including non-human primates. In C . elegans , as in other models, DR leads to reprogramming of metabolism, improvements in mitochondrial health, large changes in expression of cytoprotective genes and better proteostasis. Understandably, multiple global transcriptional regulators like transcription factors FOXO/DAF-16, FOXA/PHA-4, HSF1/HSF-1 and NRF2/SKN-1 are important for DR longevity. Considering the wide-ranging effects of p53 on organismal biology, we asked whether the C . elegans ortholog, CEP-1 is required for DR-mediated longevity assurance. We employed the widely-used TJ1 strain of cep-1(gk138) . We show that cep-1(gk138) suppresses the life span extension of two genetic paradigms of DR, but two non-genetic modes of DR remain unaffected in this strain. We find that two aspects of DR, increased autophagy and up-regulation of the expression of cytoprotective xenobiotic detoxification program (cXDP) genes, are dampened in cep-1(gk138) . Importantly, we find that background mutation(s) in the strain may be the actual cause for the phenotypic differences that we observed and cep-1 may not be directly involved in genetic DR-mediated longevity assurance in worms. Identifying these mutation(s) may reveal a novel regulator of longevity required specifically by genetic modes of DR."
