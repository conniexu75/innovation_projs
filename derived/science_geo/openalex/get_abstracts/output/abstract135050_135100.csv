The G1 cell cycle arrest is in part caused by the p53-dependent transcriptional activation of the CDK inhibitor, p21Cip1/Waf1. We report here that human p21 protein is rapidly induced but selectively cleaved during the apoptotic response to γ-irradiation. Such an event occurred early, well before the morphological appearance of apoptosis. Ectopical expression of p53 in tumor cells alone could induce p21 expression, followed by p21 cleavage and apoptosis. The cleavage of p21 could be reproduced in extracts prepared from irradiated cells or by recombinant caspase-3, suggesting that a caspase-like activity is responsible for this cleavage. p21 binds independently to both CDK2 and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Our studies indicated that p21 cleavage by the caspase-like activity specifically abolished its interaction with PCNA, suggesting that p21 cleavage may interfere with normal PCNA-dependent repair. Our data suggest that p21 may serve as a critical checkpoint regulator for both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis during the p53-mediated DNA damage response. Manipulation of the checkpoint regulators involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis may thus provide a novel strategy to cancer therapy.

Manipulation of the checkpoint regulators involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis may thus provide a novel strategy to cancer therapy. DNA damage agents are mutagens that induce genetic lesions and cause cancer. Mammalian cells respond to DNA damage signals by activating cell cycle checkpoints which arrest the cell cycle in both G1 and G2 phases or by inducing programmed cell death (apoptosis) (1Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 2White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). It is well established that the p53 tumor suppressor is responsible for both DNA damage-induced G1cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (3Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). The DNA damage-induced G1 cell cycle arrest is in part caused by the p53-dependent transcriptional activation of p21Cip1/Waf1 (4el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M.

Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 8Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The binding of p21 has been shown to inhibit the replication, but not repair, activity of PCNA in vitro (9Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar,10Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Although it remains unclear the in vivo significance of the association between p21 and PCNA, the co-localization of p21 with PCNA at the DNA repair foci, and the fact that p21 can associate with active cell cycle kinases suggest that p21 may play a role during the DNA damage response (8Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 10Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B.

Biol. 1996; 6: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Activation of p53 also induces apoptosis and dysfunction of p53 leads to cellular resistance to genotoxic stress such as DNA damage (3Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how p53 induces apoptosis in certain cells but causes cell cycle arrest in other cells. Several observations suggest that failure to express sufficient levels of p21 converts the normal cell cycle arrest into apoptotic cell death (12Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 13Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In human cancer cells that normally respond to DNA damage by cell cycle arrest, deletion of p21 genes by homologous recombination leads to the loss of cell cycle checkpoint control and cells die through apoptosis (12Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The expression of p21 is also controlled by mitogenic growth factors (13Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth factor withdrawal reduces p21 expression. DNA-damaged cells cultured under growth factor starvation conditions die through apoptotic death instead of normal cell cycle arrest (15Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Conversely, it has been reported that ectopical expression of p21 prevents the p53-mediated apoptosis in human melanoma cells (16Gorospe M. Cirielli C. Wang X. Seth P. Capogrossi M.C. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies indicate that programmed cell death or apoptosis is triggered by activation of the members of the CED-3/caspase protease family (17Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar, 18Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2124) Google Scholar). These proteases preferentially cleave protein substrates at certain aspartic acid residues. Activation of caspases during apoptosis converts the inactive, pro-enzyme form of capases into the active, processed form which in turn cleaves downstream substrates, leading to the appearance of apoptotic morphologies such as condensation of nucleoplasm, blebbing of nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes, and fragmentation of cells to form apoptotic bodies, which are accompanied with biochemical events such as DNA fragmentation (2White E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar). In mammals, a number of caspases have been identified. Among them, caspase-3 (formerly CPP32, Yama, or apopain) has been implicated in playing a critical role during apoptosis (19Alnemri E.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar,20Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). So far, a number of caspase substrates have been identified. These include poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, nuclear lamin, DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and the U1 RNA-associated 70-kDa protein (21Lazebnik Y.A. Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Poirier G.G. Earnshaw W.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 346-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2328) Google Scholar, 22Lazebnik Y.A. Takahashi A. Moir R.D. Goldman R.D. Poirier G.G. Kaufmann S.H. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9042-9046Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 23Casciola-Rosen L.A. Miller D.K. Anhalt G.J. Rosen A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether these proteins are the critical substrates that cause the manifestation of apoptotic morphology and the eventual apoptotic death of the cells. To investigate how cells control the conversion between cell cycle arrest and apoptosis during DNA damage response, we analyzed the molecular events of cell cycle regulation during γ-irradiation. We report here that in cells that are prone to apoptosis, p21 is rapidly induced by DNA damage but is selectively cleaved by a caspase-like activity. p21 thus appears to be a critical checkpoint target for both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The ML-1 (human myeloblastic leukemia) cells were a gift from Dr. David Beach (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory) and were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. WI38 (human lung fibroblasts), HCT116 (human colon carcinoma), and DLD-1 (human colon adenocarcinoma) cells were purchased from ATCC. They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. For metabolic labeling of cells with [35S]methionine, ML-1 cells were irradiated with a137Cs irradiator at various doses and then cultured in the methionine-deficient medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in the presence of 250 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (25Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). For the pulse and chase experiments, the cells were labeled for 2 h in medium containing [35S]methionine. The labeling medium was then removed and the cells were washed twice with warm RPMI 1640 medium. The chase was performed in the regular RPMI 1640 medium in the presence of 1 mm methionine. The rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against full-length human p21 and cyclin A were described previously (8Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The CDK2 antibody was raised against the 12 amino acid residues at the carboxyl-terminal as described (7Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antibody against human p27 was raised against a fusion protein (GST-p27), between glutathione S-transferase and human p27 using the protocols as described previously (7Zhang H. Xiong Y. Beach D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 25Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). All the antibodies were gifts from Dr. David Beach. Control or irradiated cells were harvested and immunoprecipitated in a buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of the following protease inhibitors: trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, and leupeptin, as well as 1 mm benzamidine for 3 h at 4 °C (25Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of various proteins was conducted using the ECL method (Amersham) as described before (25Zhang H. Kobayashi R. Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The kinase assay using histone H1 as the in vitro substrate was conducted as described (8Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The construction of adenoviruses encoding lacZ, p21, and p53 at the E1 locus under the cytomegalovirus promoter control has been described previously (16Gorospe M. Cirielli C. Wang X. Seth P. Capogrossi M.C. Holbrook N.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 26Katayose D. Wersto R. Cowan K. Seth P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

They were amplified using 293 cells as the host. The viruses were purified through two rounds of CsCl density gradient centrifugation according to Graham and Prevec (28Graham F.L. Prevec L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1991; 7: 109-128PubMed Google Scholar). For infection, 5 × 105 cells were grown to log phase and infected with adenoviruses at 10 plaque forming units/cell. Twenty-four or 48 h post-infection, the cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry analysis using propidium iodide staining as described (29Den C. Zhang P. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Leder P. Cell. 1995; 82: 675-684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1926) Google Scholar). The protein level and cleavage of p21 in the adenovirus-infected cells were analyzed using immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses as described above. Non-irradiated and irradiated ML-1 cells were collected 6 h post-irradiation. They were suspended in a buffer containing 10 m Hepes, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml each of the following protease inhibitors: trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, leupeptin, as well as 1 mm benzamidine (30Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer with a loose-type pestle. The cytosolic fraction was obtained after spinning at 100,000 × g and was stored at −80 °C until use. For in vitro translation, the cloned p21 cDNA in Bluescript-II SK- (Stratagene) was transcribed and translated with T3 RNA polymerase in the T3-coupled TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Five microliters of the in vitro translated p21 protein was incubated with 50-μl extracts (40 μg of total protein) or caspase-3 (2 μg) for 30 min at 30 °C. The protein products were isolated by immunoprecipitation. The GST-caspase-3 DNA construct was kindly provided by Dr. Emad Alnemeri (Thomas Jefferson University). It was expressed inEscherichia coli (BL21 strain) and affinity purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The caspase inhibitor, AC-DEVD-CHO, was obtained from Bachem and used at 100 nm. The site-directed mutagenesis for the p21 mutants was conducted using the method as described before (8Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). We used the ML-1 cells, a human myeloblastic leukemia cell that contains a functional p53, to investigate the DNA damage response (31Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D.B.V. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). γ-Irradiation of ML-1 cells induced cell cycle arrest (31Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D.B.V. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). Microscopic examination revealed that a substantial fraction of the cells underwent nuclear fragmentation and cell membrane blebbing, morphological changes typically associated with apoptotic cells (Fig. 1 A). The apoptotic response was damage dose-dependent and occurred in a time dependent fashion (Figs. 1 B and 3 A). After a latent period, apoptotic cells, about 30–50% of the total cell population, appeared at 5–6 h post-irradiation (Fig. 1 B). Further incubation up to 12 h or more, however, did not significantly increase the fraction of the apoptotic cells. To monitor the molecular events that may be associated with the cyclin·CDK and p21 complexes in the irradiated ML-1 cells, the non-irradiated and irradiated cells were labeled with [35S]methionine. The cyclin·CDK and p21 complexes were then isolated by immunoprecipitation with their respective antibodies. The proteins that associated with cyclin·CDK and p21 complexes were resolved in an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and compared between DNA damage treated and non-treated samples. Strikingly, a 14-kDa protein was found to specifically associate with the cyclin A, CDK2, and p21 complexes after irradiation (Fig. 2 A). The specific association of this protein was confirmed by its disappearance from the CDK2 complexes if a competing CDK2 antigenic peptide was included during immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 A). Because of these interesting features, we have further characterized p14.Figure 3p14 is a cleavage product of p21 in cells that undergo apoptosis. A, left panel,ML-1 cells were γ-irradiated (8 gray) and harvested at various time points as indicated; middle panel, WI38 and ML-1 were irradiated with various doses of γ-irradiation as indicated and harvested at 6 h post-damage treatment. Right panel,ML-1 cells were grown under log-phase (log) or saturation (sat) conditions. p21 complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation and detected by Western blot analysis with the anti-p21 antibody. B, p27 and CDK2 were isolated from irradiated cells at various time points by anti-p27 or CDK2 immunoprecipitation and examined by Western blot analyses. The kinase activity of CDK2 from the control and irradiated cells was also assayed using the histone H1 as the substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 2Association of p14 with cyclin A·CDK2 and p21 complexes in response to DNA damage. A, ML-1 cells were irradiated (8 gray) and labeled with [35S]methionine for 8 h. The cyclin A, CDK2, and p21 complexes were isolated from non-irradiated control (0 h) or irradiated cells (8 h) by immunoprecipitation with respective antibodies as indicated. The CDK2 immunoprecipitation was conducted either in the absence (−) or presence of an antigenic CDK2 peptide (+). The molecular weight standards (in kDa) are shown on the left. B,pulse and chase analysis. Irradiated ML-1 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h (pulse). The labeling medium was then removed and cells were cultured in the regular medium in the presence of 1 mm methionine (chase). The cells were harvested at various time points during the chasing period as indicated. The CDK2 complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation. Similar results were obtained with p21 and cyclin A immunoprecipitation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the identity of p14, we tested whether p14 is from a pre-existing protein or a new protein that is induced by DNA damage. To distinguish these possibilities, a pulse and chase experiment was performed. Both control and irradiated cells were pulse labeled for 2 h with [35S]methionine. After removal of the [35S]methionine-containing medium, the cells were re-cultured in regular medium and harvested at different time points (chase). The labeled proteins that associated with cyclin A, CDK2, and p21 complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed for their kinetics of disappearance or appearance. Comparison of the patterns of the proteins associated with the CDK2·p21 complexes revealed that p14 was not present during the initial pulse labeling period (first 2 h) after irradiation. However, although the labeled p21 and other proteins were disappearing during the chasing period, p14, in contrast, started to appear in the cyclin A·CDK2 and p21 complexes during subsequent hours of chasing (Fig. 2 B). As observed before, the association of p14 occurred only in the irradiated cell samples, suggesting that p14 might come from a protein that is labeled during the initial pulse labeling period in irradiated cells. To identify the source of p14, we blotted the immunoprecipitated p21 and cyclin A·CDK2 complexes with p21, CDK2, and cyclin A-specific antibodies. As expected, p21 was rapidly induced after irradiation (Fig. 3 A). In addition, the p21 antibody could detect the induction of an additional protein of 14 kDa in the irradiated cell samples. p14 became detectable between 2 and 3 h after γ-irradiation, which paralleled with the p21 induction profile (Fig. 3 A). To determine whether the presence of p14 is associated with the apoptotic process rather than cell cycle arrest, the p21 complexes from WI38 human fibroblasts and ML-1 cells were compared after γ-irradiation. WI38 cells respond to DNA damage by cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis (32Di Leonardo A. Linke S.P. Clarkin K. Wahl G.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2540-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). Although we could clearly detect the induction of p21 in WI38 cells after irradiation, p14 was present only in irradiated ML-1 cells (Fig. 3 A). To further examine whether p14 is associated with apoptosis, we tested its potential presence in apoptotic cells induced by other means. ML-1 cells undergo apoptotic death once they reach high cell density. p14 was also detectable in the ML-1 high density-induced apoptotic cells but not in the actively growing cells (Fig. 3 A). These studies suggest that p14 might be a proteolytic product of p21 in cells that are prone to apoptotic death. Since p14 is induced much earlier than any detectable apoptotic phenotypes such as nuclear blebbing, the cleavage of p21 appears to be an early event during the DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that the cleavage of p21 is quite selective, since other cell cycle regulators such as CDK2, CDK4, CDC2, cyclin A, and p27, were not detectably cleaved after irradiation (Fig. 3 B, and data not shown). We have examined the kinase activity of CDK2 complexes after irradiation using the histone H1 as the in vitro substrate. The kinase activity of CDK2 became inhibited 3 h after γ-irradiation (Fig. 3 B). This might be due to the fact that only a fraction of p21 is cleaved and there is substantial increase in total amounts of p21 after γ-irradiation (Fig. 3 A). In addition, we found that the transcription of cyclin A and cyclin B became inhibited 6–8 h after the DNA damage treatment (data not shown). Since ML-1 is a p53 positive cell line (31Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D.B.V. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar) and p53 induces both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, we tried to determine whether the expression of p53 alone can induce p21 cleavage. To deliver and express p53 efficiently, we used a recombinant adenovirus that encodes p53. We also used adenoviruses that contain lacZ or p21 genes as the control. Two well characterized human colon carcinoma cell lines, HCT116 and DLD1, were used in these experiments. HCT116 cells contain a functional p53 which have been shown to respond to p53 expression by the cell cycle arrest (33Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). DLD1 cells are deficient in p53 activity and respond to p53 expression by apoptotic death (33Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). While infection of HCT116 or DLD1 cells with adenovirus encoding lacZ or p21 did not affect cell morphology, expression of p53 in DLD1 cells caused a fraction of these cells to become rounded up and detached from the plate within 24–48 h post-infection. Such an apoptotic cell death was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 4 A). As reported before (33Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), p53 expression in HCT116 cells only caused the G1 cell cycle arrest (Fig. 4 A). Analysis of p21 from these adenovirus-infected HCT116 and DLD1 cells revealed that while both p21- and p53-containing adenoviruses induced similar high level expression of p21, p14 was present only in the p53 adenovirus-infected DLD1 cells (Fig. 4 B). These data are consistent with our previous findings in WI38 and ML-1 cells that p14 is likely to associate with the p53-mediated apoptotic response during the DNA damage treatment. The elevation of the p21 level alone is not sufficient to induce p14. To determine the protease that cleaves p21 after γ-irradiation, we prepared cell extracts from the control and γ-irradiated ML-1 cells. To assay for p21 cleavage activity, in vitro translated and [35S]methionine-labeled p21 was incubated with the cell extracts. The reaction products were recovered by immunoprecipitation with p21 antibodies and analyzed by protein gel electrophoresis. In these experiments, the cleavage of p21 could be recapitulated in the γ-irradiated extract but not in the control extract (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the in vitro cleaved p14 product migrated precisely as that of p14 isolated from the in vivoirradiated samples. Since one prominent event during apoptosis is the activation of caspase proteases (30Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar), we tested whether p21 could be cleaved by known caspases such as caspase-3, a close homologue of CED-3. A recombinant fusion protein between the glutathioneS-transferase and caspase-3 (formerly CPP32) (GST-caspase-3) was expressed in bacteria and isolated using glutathione-Sepharose beads. Incubation of in vitro translated p21 with caspase-3 produced a p14 which is identical to the one obtained from eitherin vivo cell samples after γ-irradiation or from the irradiated cell extract (Fig. 5, A and B). Partial V8 protease mapping of p14 obtained from various sources confirmed that they were identical (Fig. 5 C). In addition, we also found that p21 cleavage in the irradiated cell extract could be inhibited by the caspase-3 inhibitor, AC-DEVD-CHO (30Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3766) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 A), suggesting a caspase-like activity in the γ-irradiated cells is responsible for the p21 cleavage. To examine the biological effect of the p21 cleavage, we tried to determine the precise location of the caspase cleavage site. Inspection of the human p21 protein sequence revealed that it contained a potential caspase-3 cleavage motif between aspartic acids 109 and 112 (AEED*HVD*LSL, the first D* is aspartic acid residue 109 and the second is 112) (20Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To test whether these aspartic acids are the recognition and cleavage sites of caspase-3, we converted aspartic acid 109 or 112 individually into alanine (D109A or D112A) by site-directed mutagenesis (8Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Using the in vitro cleavage assays, our data indicated that both D109A and D112A mutants abolished the p21 cleavage by caspase-3 (Fig. 6 A). To further analyze the caspase cleavage site, we generated truncated p21 mutants that have deleted the regions after aspartic acid 109 (Asp109) or 112 (Asp112). These truncated p21 derivatives were in vitro translated and their electrophoretic mobilities were compared with that of p14. Our results indicated that aspartic acid 112 is the caspase cleavage site (Fig. 6 A). Since it has been shown that caspase-3 preferentially cleaves at an aspartic acid if a negatively charged amino acid residue is present near its amino-terminal region (20Xue D. Shaham S. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), the effect of D109A mutant on p21 cleavage is likely caused by the alteration of caspase recognition site on p21. p21 can bind to both CDK and PCNA independently. Such interactions have been shown to reside on two separate regions of p21 (34Chen J. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Dutta A. Nature. 1995; 374: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The CDK recognition domain has been mapped to the amino-terminal half of p21 while the PCNA-binding domain is at the carboxyl-terminal region. To determine the potential significance of p21 cleavage, we examined whether such a cleavage affects its binding to either PCNA or CDK2. p21 and the p21–112Z mutant derivative were fused in-frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST-p21 or GST-p21–112Z, respectively) and expressed in bacteria. The fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads. The purified GST-p21, GST-p21–112Z, and the control GST proteins were incubated with PCNA or CDK2 that was obtained from in vitro translation. The PCNA and CDK2 proteins that bound to the GST p21 proteins were then recovered from the reactions by glutathione-Sepharose beads. Our studies indicated that while GST-p21 could bind to both PCNA and CDK2 in these assays, the GST-p21–112Z protein could only bind to CDK2 and failed to associate with PCNA (Fig. 6 B). This is consistent with the mapped position of p21 cleavage, which is located at the carboxyl region of p21. In addition, we have also analyzed the effects of GST-p21 and GST-p21/112Z on the cyclin A/CDK2 activity. Both the wild type p21 and p21/112Z mutant could inhibit the in vitrokinase activity of cyclin A/CDK2 (Fig. 6 C). These data suggest that one direct consequence of p21 cleavage is the loss of its interaction with PCNA, although we cannot rule out the possibility thatin vivo the cleavage of p21 by the caspase-like activity may potentially affect p21 stability or localization during the DNA damage response. DNA damage induces both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (1Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Many lines of evidence indicate that failure to express p21 can lead to the apoptotic cell fate in response to genotoxic stress (12Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 15Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 33Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the imbalance of the cell cycle signals or failure to arrest the cell cycle may trigger the apoptotic program (1Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1995; 6: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed, ectopic expression of positive cell cycle regulators such as E2F, CDC25, Myc, or viral oncoprotein E1A causes many cells to die through apoptosis (14Galaktionov K. Chen X. Beach D. Nature. 1996; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 35Krek W. Xu G. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 1149-1158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Our finding that p21 is induced in DNA-damaged cells but selectively cleaved by a caspase-like activity prior to the appearance of apoptosis is consistent with the previous observations that the insufficient expression of p21 during DNA damage response may cause apoptosis. Although we show that a direct effect of p21 cleavage is to abolish its interaction with PCNA, the truncation of p21 during apoptosis may cause other effects such as changes in the p21 stability or cellular/nuclear localization. The cleavage of p21 may thus alter its effective inhibitory level in the cell, leading to a failure in the cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. Cells respond to DNA damage by arresting the cell cycle at G1 or G2 phase, a process that allows the time for repairing the DNA lesions (31Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D.B.V. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that p21 associates with PCNA and such an association affects PCNA replication function. Consistently, p21 is normally absent from the replicating nucleus (9Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 11Li R. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, p21 does not appear to inhibit the repair activity of PCNA (10Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). In fact, it has been reported that p21 becomes co-localized with PCNA in the nucleus at the repair foci during the DNA damage response, suggesting p21 may perform a function during the DNA repair process (11Li R. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that p21-associated cyclin·CDK complexes can exist in both active and inactive states (8Zhang H. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1750-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). One possibility is that p21 may bring its associated active cyclin·CDK complexes to the repair sites through its interaction with PCNA. If this is the case, the cleavage of p21 by caspase-like activity may interfere with DNA repair, causing prolonged presence of DNA lesions that may trigger apoptosis. Our data, together with previous reports (12Waldman T. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 13Canman C.E. Gilmer T.M. Coutts S.B. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 600-611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Polyak K. Waldman T. He T.C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1945-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), suggest that p21 is a critical checkpoint target protein for both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Manipulation of the p21 levels during DNA damage response may thus provide a novel strategy to the cancer therapy.

Although CNS neurons maintain some ability to rearrange their axonal and dendritic arbors in the adult brain, regeneration of severed CNS axons over long distances is absent. Transplantations of peripheral nerve explants into various parts of the brain and spinal cord revealed that the lack of regeneration is not primarily due to intrinsic properties of CNS neurons but is instead dependent on the microenvironment encountered by the regenerating fibers (1Richardson P.M. McGuinness U.M. Aguayo A.J. Nature. 1980; 284: 264-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 2David S. Aguayo A.J. Science. 1981; 214: 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar); CNS axons were able to grow over long distances in the peripheral nerve segments, but ceased to grow as they entered the CNS tissue again (2David S. Aguayo A.J. Science. 1981; 214: 931-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the presence of inhibitory factors rather than the lack of growth promoting molecules is responsible to the non-conducive properties of CNS tissue in adult vertebrates (for review, see Ref. 3Schwab M.E. Bartholdi D. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 319-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar).

Similarly, cryostat sections of adult CNS tissue were shown to be non-permissive substrates for neurite outgrowth, especially the densely myelinated areas (5Carbonetto S. Evans D. Cochard P. J.

Briefly, fractions (100 μl) were coated overnight on four-well plates (well area: 1 cm2, Greiner, Nürtingen, Germany) at 4 °C in a humid chamber. Unbound material was removed by three washes with Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hank's solution. 3T3 NIH fibroblasts were detached from approximately 80% confluent cultures by brief 0.1% (w/v) trypsin treatment in prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.025% (w/v) EDTA, pH 8.0. Trypsinization was stopped by addition of a 10-fold excess of serum-containing DMEM; cells were collected and resuspended in DMEM plus 10% FCS. 50 μl (8000 cells/cm2) were added to each well, and cells were scored after 1 h in culture (37 °C, 5% CO2), a time at which more than 70% of the cells had spread to large, typical fibroblasts on plastic control substrates. The percentage of cells that remained round, i.e. did not spread on the test substrate, was determined by counting in five randomly chosen areas of the dish. To determine the protein concentration that had a half-maximal inhibitory effect (EC50 values), different protein concentrations were coated and the percentage of cells that remained round was calculated for each concentration. The EC50 value corresponded to the concentration where 65% of the cells showed inhibition (half-maximal inhibitory effect over a background of ±30% round cells on control substrates). To assess neutralization of inhibitory activity, substrate-coated wells were incubated with 100 μl of Hank's buffer, IN-1, or O1 hybridoma supernatant for 20 min at 37 °C. The wells were then washed briefly with Hank's and cells were applied in the presence of Hank's, IN-1, or O1 hybridoma supernatant diluted 1: 1 with medium. All assays were done in duplicate, and about 150–200 cells were counted per condition tested. The test was performed as described previously (29Rubin B.P. Spillmann A.A. Bandtlow C.E. Keller F. Schwab M.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 2524-2529Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, NGF-primed PC12 cells were detached mechanically, trypsinized for 5 min at 37 °C with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hank's solution, and plated at a density of 3000–5000 cells/cm2 in culture medium with 100 ng/ml NGF. Assays were stopped after 24 h in culture by adding 4% (m/v) formalin buffered with NaCl/Pi(137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 8 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.4) and quantified in duplicates. In six randomly chosen fields per well, we determined the percentage of PC12 cells with neurites shorter than two diameters of the cell body. Treatment with the mAb IN-1 was performed in the same way as for the 3T3 fibroblasts (see above). About 150–200 cells were evaluated per condition tested. EC50values were determined as for the 3T3 assay (see above). 22-mm glass coverslips were coated with 0.1 mg/ml collagen (from rat tail; Ref.42), 1 μg/ml laminin (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h at 37 °C and air-dried. 10 μl of one of the following substrates was coated: 10 μg/ml gel-eluted bNI-220, 10 μg/ml semaIII/collapsin 1 (COS supernatant), or an equivalent amount of gel-eluted control protein (120 kDa, bC120) for 2 h at 37 °C. Coverslips were then blocked with F-12/DMEM culture medium (Dulbecco's MEM NUT MIX F-12 (Ham), Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.5 mg/ml streptomycin or incubated with hybridoma supernatant (mAb O1 or mAb IN-1) containing 6% FCS for 1 h at 37 °C. Four embryonic day 11–13 chick DRG explants were grown on these coverslips with 200 μl of F-12/DMEM culture medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF. Results are from three independent experiments for SemaIII, laminin, and bC120, and five independent experiments for bNI-220. Serial dilutions of purified protein were assayed for growth cone collapse on explanted chick embryonic day 11–13 (E11–E13) DRG similar as described previously (43Luo Y. Raible D. Raper J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 217-227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Briefly, explants were dissected from chick embryos and incubated at 37 °C overnight on a plastic dish coated with 1 μg of laminin (area 1 cm2) in 60 μl of L15 medium (L15 medium = 60 mg/liter imidazole, 15 mg/liter aspartic acid, 15 mg/liter glutamic acid, 15 mg/liter cystine, 5 mg/liter β-alanine, 2 mg/liter vitamin B12, 10 mg/liter inositol, 10 mg/liter choline-Cl, 0.5 mg/literdl-thioeticacid lipoic acid, 0.02 mg/liter biotin, 5 mg/liter p-aminobenzoic acid, 25 mg/liter fumaric acid, 0.4 mg/liter coenzyme A; pH 7.35) containing 50 ng/ml NGF and 0.3% methocel. The following day, 20 μl of liposomes containing different amounts of gel-eluted protein (24Bandtlow C.E. Schmidt M.F. Hassinger T.D. Schwab M.E. Kater S.B. Science. 1993; 259: 80-83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were applied to the explanted culture. Following 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the explants were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde sucrose/PBS solution. Growth cones were scored as being either spread or collapsed. The percentage of collapsed growth cones was then plotted against the concentration of the purified proteins added to the cultured explant. At least 50 growth cones were counted per explants, and for one condition, experiments were performed in duplicate. Data are the mean of three independent experiments. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Inhibitory substrate activity of the obtained fractions was routinely determined by the 3T3 spreading or by the PC12 neurite outgrowth assay. Bovine spinal cord tissue (30 min post mortem frozen to −80 °C) was carefully cleaned by stripping off the meninges and cut into small pieces. Myelin was prepared by the method of Colmanet al. (44Colman D.R. Kraibich G. Frey A.B. Sabatini D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The obtained myelin was then extracted in extraction buffer (60 mm CHAPS, 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA buffer, pH 8.0, 2.5 mmiodacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). To obtain spinal cord extract, the tissue was homogenized directly in CHAPS extraction buffer in a ratio of (1: 1; w: v). The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 100,000 × g (Kontron type: K50.13, fixed angle) for 1 h at 4 °C. The clear supernatant (extract) was immediately applied to a Q-Sepharose column (2.6 × 11.5 cm), equilibrated in buffer A (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS). Bound proteins were eluted with a five-bed volume linear gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in buffer A (100-ml gradient in 50 min). Active fractions containing bNI-220 eluted around 0.4 m NaCl and were pooled (q-pool 1) for subsequent application on a Superdex 200 (2.6 × 60 cm) column, equilibrated in buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.5% (w/v) CHAPS). Active fractions after gel filtration (s-pool 1) were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE (10 × 24 × 0.01 cm gel) under reducing conditions and low constant power (2 watts/gel) to a total of 2500 Vh. Bands and gel regions were identified after Coomassie Blue staining (0.1% w/v R250 in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid), cut out, and extracted in 800 μl of gel elution buffer (0.5% (w/v) CHAPS, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm iodacetamide, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) for at least 48 h at 4 °C (30Spillmann A.A. Amberger V.R. Schwab M.E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The IN-1 neutralizable active gel-eluted material of several gels was re-run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions, and stained with 0.1% (w/v) Coomassie Blue R250 in 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid. The 220-kDa band was cut out, and endoproteinase Lys-C digestion (1:50 molar ratio) was performed directly in the gel. The sample was acidified and applied to a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography column, peptides were separated with a linear gradient (0–100%) of 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid and 80% acetonitrile, and fractions containing single peptide species were subjected to automated Edman degradation. High resolution SDS-PAGE was carried out using 6% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10 × 24 × 0.01 cm) under reducing conditions (100 mmdithiothreitol) according to the method of Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Transfer onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) was performed in 20 mmTris base, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, 0.037% (w/v) SDS, 20% methanol (81Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar) with a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Trans Blot SD). Transfer time was 2 h at 0.8 mA/cm2. Blocking reagent (1 h at room temperature) was 3% gelatin in PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 8 g NaCl, 0.2 g of KH2PO4, 2.8 g of Na2HPO4·12H2O, and 0.2 g of KCl, dissolved in 1 liter of water) and the washing solution contained 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.4% Tween (3 × 10 min at room temperature). Incubation time for the first antibody (for dilution with 1% gelatin in PBS, see “Antibodies”) was usually overnight at 4 °C. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (1:2000) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the ECL chemiluminescence system was used for detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gel-eluted proteins from high resolution SDS-PAGE were precipitated by addition of a 9-fold excess of acetone (1 day at −20 °C), dried in a stream of nitrogen and solubilized in 10 μl of buffer that contained 2% w/v CHAPS, 0.1% w/v Triton X-100, 9 m urea, and 2% v/v ampholines (one-third volume pH 3–10, two-thirds volume pH 4–8; Millipore) (46Persson H. Overholm T. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Undissolved material was pelleted for 5 min at 13000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was applied to isoelectric focusing gels (3.5% acrylamide, 9 m urea, 2% w/v Triton X-100, 0.3 w/v CHAPS, and 6% v/v ampholines (1/3 vol. pH 3–10, 2/3 vol. pH 4–8; Millipore) in 5 cm 0.1 mm capillaries, (46Persson H. Overholm T. Electrophoresis. 1990; 11: 642-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The isoelectrically focused proteins were separated in the second dimension by 6% (w/v) SDS-PAGE (6 × 8 × 0.0075 cm) under reducing conditions (47Boxberg Y.V. Anal Biochem. 1988; 169: 372-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Gel-eluted fractions after high resolution SDS-PAGE as described above were precipitated by addition of a 9-fold excess of acetone (1 day at −20 °C), dried in a stream of nitrogen, and solubilized in 100 μl of buffer, which contained various concentrations of different detergents. Undissolved material was pelleted for 5 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was then tested in the PC12 neurite outgrowth assay. Urea was added to the gel eluted fractions to the desired final concentration. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C, the solution was tested in the PC12 neurite outgrowth assay. Trypsin was added to gel-eluted fractions resulting in a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), incubated for 1 min at 37 °C and then put on ice. As a control, either heat-inactivated trypsin (5 min, 100 °C) or trypsin inhibitor 0.2% (w/v) together with trypsin 0.1% (w/v) were used and processed in the same way. After centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, supernatants were analyzed in the PC12 neurite outgrowth assay and by SDS-PAGE. Gel-eluted fractions were incubated for 0, 5, or 30 min at 100 °C and then put on ice. After centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, supernatants were analyzed in the PC12 neurite outgrowth assay. To verify the presence of sugars in a possible glycoconjugate, the digoxigenin glycan detection kit from Boehringer Mannheim was used. The principle is as follows. Hydroxyl groups of sugars of glycoconjugates are oxidized to aldehyde groups by mild periodate treatment. Digoxigenin is then covalently attached to these aldehydes via a hydrazide group. Digoxigenin is detected in an enzyme immunoassay using a digoxigenin specific antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. N-Glycosidase F treatment was performed according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). Briefly, samples were boiled for 5 min at 100 °C and cooled on ice. Then, 2 units ofN-glycosidase F (Boehringer) was added and the mixture was incubated for 14 h at 37 °C. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 0.1 m NaOH. 50 μl of gel-eluted fractions (∼0.4 μg of protein) were incubated with 20 milliunits of affinity-purified chondroitinase ABC (Sigma) in 40 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, for 3 h at 37 °C (48Watanabe E. Aono S. Matsui F. Yamada Y. Naruse I. Oohira A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 547-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and then put on ice. After centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge, supernatants were analyzed either by SDS-PAGE or in the PC12 neurite outgrowth assay. All data are expressed as means ± standard error of the mean (S.E.). Statistical analysis was performed according to the one-tailed, paired Student's ttest. Protein determination was carried out by the method of Bradford (49Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) or was estimated after silver-stained SDS-PAGE (50Merril C.R. Goldman D. Sedman S.A. Ebert M.H. Science. 1981; 211: 1437-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). For the purification of the IN-1 antigen present in bovine CNS myelin, two culture assays in combination with the neutralizing mAb IN-1 were used. The first bioassay tests the effect of substrates on the spreading behavior of 3T3 fibroblasts, which has been shown previously to be strongly impaired by oligodendrocytes and CNS myelin (10Schwab M.E. Caroni P. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2381-2393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second bioassay analyzes substrate effects on the neurite outgrowth response of PC12 cells (29Rubin B.P. Spillmann A.A.

This transcriptionally regulated receptor is a critical mediator of endothelial cell (EC) growth and vascular development. In this study, we identify a DNA element modulating KDR promoter activity and evaluate the nuclear binding proteins accounting for a portion of the cell-type specificity of the region. KDR promoter luciferase activity was retained within −85/+296 and was 10–30-fold higher in EC than non-EC. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated specific nuclear protein binding to −85/−64, and single point mutations suggested important binding nucleotides between −79/−68 with five critical bases between −74/−70 (5′-CTCCT-3′). DNA-protein complexes were displaced by Sp1 consensus sequence oligodeoxynucleotides and supershifted by Sp1- and Sp3-specific antibodies. Sp1 and Sp3 protein in EC nuclear extracts bound the −79/−68 region even when all surrounding classic Sp1 recognition sites were removed. Sp1 protein in nuclear extracts was 4–24-fold higher in EC than non-EC, whereas Sp3 was 3–7-fold higher. Sp1/Sp3 ratios in EC were 2–10-fold higher. Overexpression of Sp1 protein increased KDR promoter activity 3-fold in both EC and non-EC, whereas simultaneous co-expression of Sp3 attenuated this response. An Sp1 consensus sequence ciselement “decoy” reduced EC KDR promoter activity and mRNA expression by 85 and 69%, respectively. An antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide to Sp1 inhibited Sp1 and KDR protein expression by 66 and 68%, respectively, without changing Sp3 protein expression.These data illustrate that Sp1 and Sp3 modulate KDR promoter activity through a novel recognition binding sequence. However, since Sp1-mediated promoter activation is attenuated by Sp3, endothelial selective KDR promoter activity may be partially regulated by variations in the Sp1/Sp3 ratio.

Recent analysis of the human KDR promoter has demonstrated that maximal activity resides in the −225 to +127 5′-flanking region of the KDR gene relative to the transcriptional start site and that deletions of −95 to −37 result in complete loss of promoter activity (39Patterson C.

This region of the KDR promoter contains putative AP2-, Sp1-, and NFκB-binding sites. DNase I footprinting experiments by Pattersonet al. (40Patterson C. Wu Y. Lee M.-E. DeVault J.D. Runge M.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 8410-8416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) suggest that transcription factor Sp1 binds the human KDR promoter in this region and that Sp1 binding is endothelial cell-specific in vivo, potentially due to cell-specific alterations in chromatin structure. Nevertheless, it has not been documented that Sp1 binding actually alters either KDR promoter activity or KDR expression, and the involvement of other nuclear proteins modulating expression of this gene have not been fully defined. Due to the critical role of KDR in mediating important physiologic and pathologic processes and the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms of endothelial cell-specific KDR gene expression, we have performed a detailed functional characterization of the DNA-binding proteins regulating KDR promoter activity in both endothelial and non-endothelial cells. In this article we provide evidence that transcription factor Sp1 increases KDR promoter activity in both endothelial and non-endothelial cells through binding to a novel recognition sequence, whereas simultaneous co-expression of Sp3 attenuates this response. These data suggest that portions of KDR promoter activity and endothelial selective expression of KDR may in part be regulated by variations in the Sp1/Sp3 ratio. In addition, our data demonstrate that the majority of KDR promoter activity, mRNA expression, and protein synthesis require Sp1 activity in endothelial cells. Primary cultures of bovine retinal endothelial cells (BREC), retinal pericytes (BRPC), retinal pigment epithelial cells (BRPE), smooth muscle cells (BSMC), fibroblasts (BFibro), and aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated from fresh slaughterhouse tissues by homogenization and a series of filtration steps as described previously (14Aiello L.P. Northrup J.M. Keyt B.A. Takagi H. Iwamoto M.A. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1995; 113: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). BREC were cultured in Endothelial Basal Medium (Clonetics, San Diego) with 10% plasma-derived horse serum (Wheaton Scientific), heparin (50 mg/liter), and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth factor (Boehringer Mannheim). BRPC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5.5 mm glucose and 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone). BAEC, BRPE, BSMC, BFibro, COS, Chinese hamster ovary, and 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). HUVEC were cultured in M199 media with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% air, and media were changed every 2–3 days. The pGL2 Basic plasmid (Promega) contains the firefly luciferase gene with no promoter or enhancer. Plasmid pSV40βgal (Promega) contains the β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter and enhancer. A 100-kb human genomic DNA fragment encompassing the KDR gene was obtained by P1 phage cloning (42Pierce J.C. Sternberg N.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 216: 549-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequence comparison to previously published data (39Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A luciferase reporter construct containing 4.3 kb of the KDR 5′-flanking region was created by restriction digestion of the purified P1 phage DNA with BamHI and XhoI, corresponding to the −4-kb and +296 sites of the KDR gene, respectively. In this article, all KDR gene nucleotides are expressed relative to the KDR transcriptional start site which is defined as +1. The fragment was inserted into the pGL2 Basic plasmid. Similar luciferase reporter constructs were created from human KDR regions −101/+296 and −85/+296 (Fig. 1 A). These were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of KDR P1 phage DNA and were inserted into plasmid pGL2 Basic. All constructs were sequenced from both the 5′ and 3′ ends to confirm orientation and sequence. The Sp1 and Sp3 expression vectors were generously provided by Dr. Jonathan M. Horowitz (Duke University Medical Center) and were constructed from Sp1 and Sp3 cDNA cloned into pCMV-4, an expression vector containing the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter, as described previously (43Michelotti E.F.

Nineteen different double-stranded 22-mer oligodeoxynucleotides representing the KDR promoter region −85/−64 were constructed with each incorporating 1–6 nucleotide substitutions by synthesis of complementary single-stranded fragments (Oligos Etc.) and subsequent annealing at room temperature after heating to 95 °C (Fig. 1 B). Site-directed mutagenesis of nucleotides within the human KDR −85/+296 luciferase reporter construct was performed using polymerase chain reaction and the human KDR P1 phage DNA as template. The nucleotides mutated (−85 to −80, −76 to −74, or −73 to −71) were identical to those changed in oligodeoxynucleotide mutations 1, 3, and 4, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1 B. Internal mismatches in the 5′ primer were used in conjunction with a 3′ primer matched to the XhoI site of the coding area. The amplified polymerase chain reaction fragment was gel-purified and digested with XhoI at nucleotide +296 and cloned directly into the pGL2 Basic plasmid. All mutation constructs were sequenced from the 5′ and 3′ ends to confirm orientation and sequence. Plasmid DNA was introduced into all cell types with the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as instructed by the manufacturer. The appropriate luciferase reporter construct (1 μg) was always co-transfected with 1 μg of pSV40βgal to normalize for transfection efficiency in the 1.5–3.0 × 105 cells used. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and an ML3000 microtiter plate luminometer (Dynatech Laboratories). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described previously (46Rosenthal N. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 704-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). For each transfection, luciferase activity was divided by β-galactosidase activity to obtain normalized luciferase activity. The Sp1 and Sp3 expression plasmids and transfection conditions are described above. All cells were transfected with a total of 2 μg of expression plasmids for 48 h in one of the following combinations: 2 μg of pCMV4 (control), 1 μg of Sp1-pCMV4, and 1 μg of pCMV4, 1 μg of Sp3-pCMV4 and 1 μg of pCMV4, or 1 μg of Sp1-pCMV4 and 1 μg of Sp3-pCMV4. All cells were also co-transfected with 1 μg of pSV40βgal to normalize for transfection efficiency. Preparation of nuclear extracts was performed as described previously (47Andrews N.C. Faller D.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (48Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), and the same amount of nuclear protein was subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assays as described previously (49Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were constructed by annealing commercially synthesized complementary single-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to published human sequences (39Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 41Briggs M.R. Kadonaga J.T. Bell S.P.

Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). The KDR sequences used are detailed in Fig. 1. Oligodeoxynucleotide sequences corresponding to DNA binding consensus sites were as follows: Sp1, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; NFκB, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; AP1, 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′; and AP2, 5′-GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT-3′. Radiolabeled probes were generated from double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides by end labeling using 0.2 units/μl polynucleotide kinase, 0.35 pmol/μl DNA, and [γ-32P]dATP in a total volume of 10 μl. After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with EDTA, and the labeled probe was purified using a NAP5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Radiolabeled oligonucleotides (5000–10,000 cpm) were incubated with 7 μg of nuclear protein and 2.0 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a total volume of 15 μl. For competition experiments, nonradioactive double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were added in 100-fold molar excess prior to addition of the probe. For supershift analyses, nuclear extracts were incubated with rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibodies specific for Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, Sp4, c-Fos, c-Jun, AP2, NFκB p65, and NFκB p50 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody specific for retinoblastoma protein (Rb) was also used (PharMingen). All DNA-protein complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis through 5% polyacrylamide gels run in 22.3 mm Tris, 22.3 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Visualization was performed using both a computing PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software analysis (Molecular Dynamics) and autoradiography on Kodak XAR-5 film. Northern and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (53Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Endege W.O. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 54Takagi H. King G.L. Ferrara N. Aiello L.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 1311-1321PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitation of Northern blots was performed using a computing PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Lane loading differences were normalized by hybridization with radiolabeled 36B4 cDNA (55Aiello L.P. Robinson G.S. You-Wei L. Nishio Y. King G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6231-6235Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, rabbit anti-human polyclonal antibodies specific for Sp3 and flk-1(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody specific for Sp1 (PharMingen) were used. Visualization was performed using Amersham Pharmacia Biotech ECL detection system per manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded phosphorothioate-modified oligodeoxynucleotides corresponding to the consensus binding sequences of Sp1 (PS-Sp1) and NFκB (PS- NFκB) were made by annealing complementary single-stranded phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (Oligos, Etc.). Decoys were co-transfected into cells along with the −101/+296 KDR-luciferase pGL2 construct and the pSV40βgal plasmid. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured after 48 h as described above. A phosphorothioate-modified antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-ATATTAGGCATCACTCCAGG-3′) directed against the Sp1 transcription start site and its sense control (5′-CCTGGAGTGATGCCTAATAT-3′) were commercially synthesized (Oligos, Etc.). Cells were transfected with 1 μm oligodeoxynucleotide using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as instructed by the manufacturer. Total protein was harvested for Western blot analysis of Sp1, Sp3, and KDR expression after 48 h as described above. All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar findings, and results are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. The unpaired ttest was used for comparisons of groups with equal variance and normal distribution. The Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test was used for comparison of groups with unequal variance or non-normal distributions. Ap value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To confirm endothelial specific expression of KDR in the primary cell cultures of interest in this study, Northern blot analysis using a human KDR cDNA probe was performed on total RNA (20 μg/lane) extracted from various cell types of both endothelial and non-endothelial origin (Fig. 2 A). KDR mRNA was detected from all endothelial cell cultures (BREC, BAEC, and HUVEC), but no signal was observed from non-endothelial cells (BSMC, BRPC, BRPE, or BFibro). KDR expression was also undetectable using polyadenylated RNA in non-endothelial cells (data not shown). The hybridization signal was greatest for HUVEC probably since both cDNA probe and cell type were of human origin. Between the two bovine endothelial cell types, KDR expression was 2-fold greater in BREC than BAEC. This finding is consistent with our previous report that KDR receptor number is 3-fold higher in BREC than in BAEC (56Thieme H. Aiello L.P. Takagi H. Ferrara N. King G.L. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 98-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study suggested that positive regulatory elements exist in the KDR promoter region −95 to −60 (39Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To evaluate this area further, we isolated a 100-kb human genomic fragment including the KDR gene by P1 phage cloning. A fragment containing the −101/+296 region was cloned into the pGL2 basic firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega) which contains neither a promoter nor enhancer. A similar vector incorporating the −85 to +296 region of the KDR promoter was constructed. The luciferase reporter constructs were co-transfected into a variety of cell types along with pSV40βgal to normalize for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity was measured after 48 h. Results using the −85/+296 construct are shown (Fig. 2 B). Normalized KDR promoter luciferase activity was 500- and 200-fold greater than that of control plasmid in BREC and BAEC, respectively. KDR promoter activity was 2.8-fold greater in BREC than in BAEC. Promoter activity was 8–30-fold lower in the non-endothelial cell types tested. Similar results were observed using the −101 to +296 region of the KDR promoter (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that KDR mRNA expression is restricted to endothelial cells and that the endothelial cell specificity of the KDR promoter is retained within the −85 to +296 region. Previous reports have shown a near complete loss of KDR promoter activity when the region 5′ to nucleotide −60 is deleted (39Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These data and those described above suggest that the region regulating endothelial specific activity resides between −85 and −60. To determine if nuclear proteins could specifically bind this region, EMSA was performed using nuclear extract from BREC and radiolabeled KDR promoter fragment −101/−56 (Fig. 3 A). Specific DNA-protein binding complexes were evident as a major slower migrating band (immediately above a wea"

The apparent molecular masses of purified STL1 and STL2 were estimated to be 84 and 68 kDa, respectively, by gel filtration chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry of these lectins revealed that STL1 was composed of noncovalently linked trimer of 31.4-kDa subunits, and STL2 was noncovalently linked trimer of 21.5-kDa subunits. The minimum concentrations of STL1, a major component, and STL2, a minor component, needed to agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes were 9 and 0.2 μg/ml, respectively. The most effective saccharide in the hemagglutination inhibition assay for both STL1 and STL2 was l-rhamnose. Saccharides possessing the same configuration of hydroxyl groups at C2 and C4 as that in l-rhamnose, such asl-arabinose and d-galactose, also inhibited. The amino acid sequence of STL2 was determined by analysis of peptides generated by digestion of the S-carboxamidomethylated protein with Achromobacter protease I orStaphylococcus aureus V8 protease. The STL2 subunit of 195 amino acid residues proved to have a unique polypeptide architecture; that is, it was composed of two tandemly repeated homologous domains (STL2-N and STL2-C) with 52% internal homology. These two domains showed a sequence homology to the subunit (105 amino acid residues) ofd-galactoside-specific sea urchin (Anthocidaris crassispina) egg lectin (37% for STL2-N and 46% for STL2-C, respectively). The N terminus of the STL1 subunit was blocked with an acetyl group. However, a partial amino acid sequence of the subunit showed a sequence similarity to STL2. Moreover, STL2 also showed a sequence homology to the ligand binding domain of the vitellogenin receptor. We have also employed surface plasmon resonance biosensor methodology to investigate the interactions between STL2 and major egg yolk proteins from steelhead trout, lipovitellin, and β′-component, which are known as vitellogenin digests. Interestingly, STL2 showed distinct interactions with both egg yolk proteins. The estimated values for the affinity constant (K a) of STL2 to lipovitellin and β′ component were 3.44 × 106 and 4.99 × 106, respectively. These results suggest that the fish egg lectins belong to a new family of animal lectin structurally related to the low density lipoprotein receptor super- family.

Lectins are a group of sugar-binding proteins that recognize specific carbohydrate structures and agglutinate a variety of animal cells by binding to cell-surface glycoproteins and glycolipids. The present state of knowledge permits us to organize the known animal lectins into several categories depending on sequence similarity and common characteristics such as sugar binding specificity, conserved carbohydrate recognition domains, and ion requirements, i.e.C-type, I-type, galectins, pentraxins, and P-type lectin (1Drickamer K.

The fish egg lectins are characterized by their binding affinity to l-rhamnose, with a few exceptions (8Krajhanzl A. Adv. Lectin Res. 1990; 3: 83-131Google Scholar, 11Hosono M. Nitta K. Tohoku Yakka Daigaku Kenkyu Nenpo. 1993; 40: 21-43Google Scholar). In other species, l-rhamnose-binding lectins have been found only in American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) (12Kubo T.

The physiological significance of the existence and the structure of the l-rhamnose-binding proteins in fish eggs have not been clarified yet. However, they may be involved in a variety of biological functions, including regulation of carbohydrate metabolism (14Krajhanzl A. Danisova A. Kocourek J. Pancoska P.

In the present paper, we report the isolation and characterization ofl-rhamnose-binding lectins from the egg of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and the complete amino acid sequence of the lectin, STL2. Surprisingly, its tandemly repeated domains are homologous to the ligand-binding domain of the vitellogenin receptor, which belong to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; CAM, S-carboxamidomethyl; Lv, lipovitellin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; VTG, vitellogenin; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; STLs, steelhead trout lectins; SUEL, sea urchin egg lectin. receptor superfamily. Furthermore, the interaction of STL2 with two major egg york proteins, lipovitellin (Lv) and β′ component, which derived from vitellogenin, was demonstrated by a biosensor based on surface plasmon resonance (21Schuster S.C. Swanson R.V. Alex L.A. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 343-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Based on their structural properties and kinetic measurements, we discuss the biological functions of the l-rhamnose-specific lectins from fish eggs. The eggs were obtained from mature steelhead trout (5∼6 years old, 2∼3 kg weight) cultured in Tomakomai Experimental Forest Station, Hokkaido University, Hokkaido, Japan.Achromobacter protease I, Staphylococcus aureusV8 protease, and α-l-rhamnose monohydrate were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Ind. (Osaka, Japan), Epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B, Superdex 200, and HiTrap Q column were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. An l-rhamnose-Sepharose 6B gel was prepared according to the directions by Amersham. All other reagents were the purest grade commercially available. Eggs (5 kg) was homogenized and defatted with acetone and filtered through filter paper, and the filtrate was dried at room temperature to yield 1.7 kg of the acetone powder. The acetone powder (50 g) was homogenized with 300 ml of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl containing 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with l-rhamnose-Sepharose 6B gel (∼50 ml), and the suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 10 h with gentle shaking. Unabsorbed substances were removed by washing the gel with 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.15m NaCl (ABS buffer). The gel was packed in a column (3.0 × 10 cm) and washed with ABS, and then the adsorbed substance was eluted with 0.2 ml-rhamnose in ABS. The fractions with significant absorption at 280 nm were collected and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The lectin fraction was further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q column (5 ml, Amersham) pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in the same buffer. Each peak was collected, dialyzed against distilled water thoroughly, and then lyophilized. During the purification steps, protein concentration was determined by the Bradford dye binding assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were diluted with 50 μl of 0.15 m NaCl on microtiter plates and mixed with 50 μl of 4% rabbit erythrocyte suspension. The mixture was allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 min, and then the hemagglutination activity was measured. The hemagglutination activity was defined as the titer value of maximum dilution with positive agglutination of 2% rabbit erythrocytes. The inhibitory effects of saccharides on hemagglutination were assayed as follows. The saccharide solutions (25 μl) tested in this study were diluted 2-fold in series on microtiter plates and incubated with 25 μl of the lectin solution having hemagglutination titer values of 23 for 15 min. The rabbit erythrocytes suspension (4%, 50 μl) was added to the mixture and incubated for 30 min. The inhibitory activities were estimated by the minimum concentration of sugar needed to cause negative hemagglutination. The thermostability of the lectins was examined by the hemagglutination assay described above after incubating for various periods at 40, 50, 60, or 70 °C. To test the dependence of divalent cations on hemagglutination, the lectins were treated in 0.1 m EDTA for 15 min at room temperature and dialyzed against 0.15 mNaCl at 4 °C overnight. The lectin solution was tested for hemagglutination activity in the absence or presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+ ions in 0.15 mNaCl. The molecular weights of STLs and their subunits were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), gel filtration and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Kompact MALDI I, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (49Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) using 15% separating gel in the presence or absence of 2-mercaptoethanol, and protein bands were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Gel filtration was performed on a Superdex 200 column (1 × 30 cm) eluted with 20 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 10 mml-rhamnose. For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, proteins were embedded in a sinapinic acid (3, 5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) matrix, which absorbs UV-light, for analysis. Desorption and ionization of the mixed sample and matrix were induced by a nitrogen laser at 337 nm with a pulse width of 3 ns. 100 single-shot spectra were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. A second measurement was performed with insulin (M r 5,734.5) (bovine pancreas, Sigma) as an internal standard. Thus, it was possible to determine the molecular weight of the samples with an accuracy of 0.1%. STL2 was reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 0.25 mTris-HCl buffer (pH 8.6) containing 10 mm EDTA and 6m guanidine hydrochloride at 37 °C for 2 h and reacted with 20 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature with shielding from light to convert freshly generated cysteine residues into S-carboxamidomethyl cysteine. Excess reagent was removed by gel filtration on a HiTrap desalting column (5 ml, Amersham) pre-equilibrated with 0.1 mNH4HCO3 (pH 8.0). CAM-STL2 (50 nmol) was dissolved in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 1 m urea and digested withAchromobacter protease I (S/E = 100:1) at 37 °C for 16 h. CAM-STL2 (50 nmol) was also digested with S. aureus V8 protease (S/E = 50:1) in 1 ml of 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) in the presence of 1 murea at 37 °C for 12 h. Each digest was separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a TSKgel ODS 120T column (5 μm, inner diameter 4.6 mm × 250 mm) (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) using a gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Amino acid compositions were determined by the precolumn labeling method (23Knecht R. Chang J.-K. Anal. Chem. 1986; 57: 2375-2379Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 24Muramoto K. Kamiya H. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) using 4-dimethylaminoazobenzene-4′-sulfonyl chloride (Pierce). The amino acid sequences of purified proteins and proteolytic peptides were determined by a gas-phase protein sequencer (Shimadzu PSQ-1). Molecular mass determination of the peptides was performed by using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described above. Homologous sequences were searched by FASTA program (25Pearson W.R. Lipman D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (9393) Google Scholar) accessed by Genome Net WWW 2Internet address: http://www.genome.ad.jp. . Hydropathy profile analysis and the secondary structure prediction of STL2 were performed on the basis of the primary structure according to the methods of Kyte and Doolittle (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar) and Chou and Fasman (27Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar), respectively. BIAcoreTM (Amersham), which is based on surface plasmon resonance, was used to determine the interaction between STL2 and egg yolk proteins from steelhead trout. Two major egg yolk, Lv and β′ component, were isolated according to the procedure of Hara and Hirai (28Hara A. Hirai H. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1978; 59: 339-343Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Purified Lv and β′ component were diluted to a concentration of 10 and 50 μg/ml, respectively, in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0 and 4.0, respectively) and immobilized to the carboxymethylated dextran-modified gold surface of a CM5 sensor chip via primary amino groups using carbodiimide chemistry as described in the manufacture's manual. Briefly, the carboxyl groups on CM5 were activated by 10 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide and 400 mm N-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide followed by the addition of Lv or β′ component. The remaining activated groups were blocked by ethanolamine. Employing these condition, the immobilization of Lv and β′ component resulted in covalent linking of 3300 and 500 resonance units, respectively. For most proteins, 1000 resonance units corresponds to a surface concentration of about 1 ng/mm2. The sensor chip surface was regenerated with 10 mm HCl (40 μl) at the end of each measurement. STL2 was dissolved in HBS (0.01 m HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P-20) at the concentration of 12.5 μg/ml, and 2–16 serial solutions were injected over the Lv- or β′ component-immobilized surfaces and over unmodified sensor chip CM5 as a control at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The effects ofl-rhamnose to the bindings between STL2 and egg yolk proteins were also analyzed by adding 0.2 ml-rhamnose in STL2 solution. Sensorgrams were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using BIAevaluation software. A single-site binding model was adopted for analysis of interactions between STL2 and immobilized Lv and β′ component. A fraction containing lectin was obtained from the acetone powder of the steelhead trout eggs by means of affinity chromatography onl-rhamnose-Sepharose 6B (Fig. 1). The fraction obtained from affinity chromatography gave two peaks on a HiTrap Q anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2). Since both peaks contained protein showing strong agglutination activity on rabbit erythrocytes and gave a single protein band on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3), proteins isolated from the first and second peaks were designated as STL1 and STL2, respectively. TableI summarizes the purification results of STLs. The yields of STL1 and STL2 from 50 g of saline extract of eggs were 170 and 120 μg, respectively. The low recovery of lectins from affinity chromatography was mainly due to the precipitation during dialysis before ion exchange chromatography. Purified STL2 showed more potent hemagglutinating activity (0.2 μg/ml) than did STL1 (9 μg/ml).Figure 2Purification of STLs by anion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q column.

Open table in a new tab Gel filtration on Superdex 200 showed that the approximate molecular masses of STL1 and STL2 were 84 and 68 kDa, respectively (data not shown). Each STL gave single bands at 28 kDa (STL1) and 22 kDa (STL2) on SDS-PAGE in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol and at 35 kDa (STL1) and 28 kDa (STL2) in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 3), suggesting that STL1 and STL2 possess internal disulfide bonds. Furthermore, the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of STL1 gave a predominant peak at 31.4 kDa and minor peaks at 63 and 94 kDa, and STL2 gave a predominant peak at 21.5 kDa and minor peaks at 43 and 64.5 kDa (Fig. 4). These results indicate that STL1 is a noncovalently linked trimer consisting of the 31.4-kDa subunits and that STL2 is a noncovalently linked trimer consisting of 21.5-kDa subunits. The isoelectric points of STL1 and STL2 were measured to be 6.75 and 4.70, respectively, by isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis (data not shown). STL1 completely lost its hemagglutinating activity by heating at 50 °C for 90 min, whereas STL2 retained half of the activity under the same conditions (Fig. 5). However, STL2 was inactivated by heating at 70 °C for 10 min. STLs maintained their hemagglutination activities between pH 4 and 7 (data not shown). No appreciable change was seen in the hemagglutinating activities of STL 1 and STL2 after treatment with 0.1 m EDTA, whereas no enhanced activity was observed by the addition of Ca2+ ion or Mg2+ ion (data not shown). In the hemagglutination inhibition assay using rabbit erythrocytes, l-rhamnose was the most potent monosaccharide inhibitor for both STL1 and STL2 (TableII). Melibiose, l-arabinose. and d-galactose, which possess the same hydroxyl group orientation at C2 and C4 of the pyranose ring structure ofl-rhamnose, also showed inhibitory effects. On the other hand, other monosaccharides tested (Table II) showed no inhibitory activity even at concentrations of 0.2 m. Glycoproteins such as mucine type 1, asialomucine type 1, and fetuin also did not show any inhibition at concentrations up to 0.1%.Table IIInhibition of hemagglutination activity of STLs by saccharidesSaccharideaMinimum concentration of saccharides required for complete inhibition.STL1STL2mml-Rhamnose0.30.3Melibiose12.53.1l-Arabinose25100d-Galactose5050Lactose100100Othersbd-Glucose, d-mannose,d-xylose, l-fucose,d-N-acetylglucosamine,d-N-acetylgalactosamine, mucine type 1, asialomucine type 1, and fetuin.>200>2002% intact rabbit erythrocytes and 8 hemagglutinating units of STLs were used in each well.a Minimum concentration of saccharides required for complete inhibition.b d-Glucose, d-mannose,d-xylose, l-fucose,d-N-acetylglucosamine,d-N-acetylgalactosamine, mucine type 1, asialomucine type 1, and fetuin. Open table in a new tab 2% intact rabbit erythrocytes and 8 hemagglutinating units of STLs were used in each well. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of CAM-STL2 identified the first 38 residues including three CAM-cysteine. The enzymatic digest of CAM-STL2 (50 nmol) withAchromobacter protease I and S. aureus V8 protease was separated by reversed-phase HPLC as shown in Fig. 6. Each generated peptide, designated L1∼L8 for Achromobacter protease I and V1∼V9 forS. aureus V8 protease, was isolated and subjected to amino acid analysis and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (TableIII). The N-terminal sequence of L8 was identical to that of native protein (Fig. 6). The successive amino acid sequences of L1∼L6, V1∼V7, and V9 were determined up to their C terminus by a gas phase protein sequencer (Fig. 6). L5 was a part of L8. The peptides necessary for overlaps were obtained from digestion of CAM-STL2 with V8 protease. The sequences of peptides V3, V9, and V7 established the connections between peptides L8/L5 and L6, between L6 and L7, and between L4 and L3, respectively. The sequence determination of V8 established the connections between peptides L7 and L2 and between L2 and L1. Thus, the complete amino acid sequence of CAM-STL2 was determined as shown at the top of Fig. 7. STL2 was composed of 195 amino acid residues with a molecular mass calculated to be 21,349 Da, which is in good agreement with the value (21,500 Da) obtained from MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. STL2 contained 16 half-Cys and 22 Thr residues. On the other hand, no His, Met, or Trp residues were present. Sugar analysis of CAM-STL2 showed no evidence for the existence of sugar chains in the molecule as predicted from the absence of a potentialN-linked glycosylation site (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr). The hydropathy profile showed that STL2 is rather hydrophilic protein except for a hydrophobic segment existing in the N-terminal region (Fig. 8). STL2 was predicted to form β-structures all over the molecule (data not shown). Amino acid sequence analysis revealed a unique polypeptide architecture of STL2; it was composed of tandemly repeated homologous domains, each of which consisted of 99 and 96 amino acid residues (Fig. 9). Fifty-two percent of amino acids were identical between the N-terminal domain (STL2-N) and the C-terminal domain (STL2-C). All half-Cys residues were conserved between two tandem repeats. The hydrophobicity profiles were also similar to each other (Fig. 8).Table IIIAmino acid compositions of STL2 and peptides used for sequence analysisL8aL and V demonstrate the peptides generated by cleavage of the CAM protein with Achromobacter protease I andS. aureus V8 protease, respectively.L5L6L7L2L1L4L3V4V5V3V9V6V1V8V7V2STL2Asx8.4 (8)4.3 (4)2.1 (2)4.5 (4)2.8 (3)0.6 (1)3.3 (3)0.5 (1)1.5 (2)0.7 (1)1.0 (1)0.2 (0)0.9 (1)4.8 (5)4.3 (4)0.2 (0)20.4 (22)Glx9.0 (9)5.8 (6)2.9 (3)6.9 (7)1.9 (2)0.7 (1)1.1 (1)0.8 (1)1.3 (1)4.1 (4)2.8 (3)1.2 (1)0.7 (1)1.7 (2)4.2 (5)1.9 (2)0.3 (0)23.7 (23)CM-CysbS-Carboxamidomethyl-cysteine was determined as S-carboxymethyl-cysteine (CM) by amino acid analysis.6.4 (5)3.0 (3)1.7 (2)4.5 (4)0.6 (1)1.1 (1)1.0 (2)0.7 (1)1.0 (1)0.9 (1)2.0 (2)0.5 (1)2.0 (2)2.5 (2)3.1 (3)0.8 (1)15.9 (16)Ser1.7 (3)2.1 (2)0.8 (1)4.7 (4)2.9 (3)2.2 (2)0.3 (0)1.2 (1)0.8 (1)1.0 (1)1.3 (1)1.1 (1)4.3 (5)2.3 (2)0.2 (0)16.0 (13)Thr9.1 (9)6.7 (7)1.6 (2)5.1 (6)2.9 (3)1.4 (1)1.0 (1)2.9 (3)3.9 (4)1.0 (1)5.0 (5)3.3 (4)1.3 (1)1.0 (1)17.2 (22)Gly7.4 (7)4.4 (5)1.3 (1)2.8 (3)1.3 (1)2.2 (2)1.2 (1)1.7 (2)2.0 (2)0.8 (1)1.3 (1)0.4 (0)1.1 (1)2.4 (2)2.4 (3)1.1 (1)13.0 (15)Ala2.4 (2)2.4 (2)0.4 (0)2.9 (3)2.4 (2)1.2 (1)1.1 (1)1.0 (1)0.8 (1)1.6 (1)0.4 (0)1.0 (1)1.2 (1)3.5 (4)1.4 (1)0.9 (1)10.9 (10)Arg6.2 (6)4.0 (4)1.0 (1)2.8 (3)1.0 (1)1.0 (1)2.8 (2)1.2 (1)0.9 (1)0.9 (1)1.2 (1)3.2 (3)1.0 (1)14.1 (12)Pro1.3 (1)1.0 (1)1.6 (1)1.7 (1)0.8 (1)2.4 (2)0.2 (0)0.8 (1)0.9 (1)1.0 (1)1.0 (1)1.9 (2)0.2 (0)6.6 (6)Val4.0 (5)1.0 (1)3.7 (4)1.7 (1)1.0 (1)2.0 (2)0.9 (1)0.3 (0)0.3 (0)1.9 (2)1.8 (2)0.3 (0)2.3 (2)1.9 (2)0.8 (1)10.3 (14)MetIle2.6 (3)1.6 (1)3.5 (4)0.7 (1)0.9 (1)0.2 (0)1.3 (1)1.5 (2)2.8 (3)0.6 (1)7.0 (10)Leu5.4 (5)4.4 (4)3.5 (3)2.2 (2)1.1 (1)0.7 (1)1.4 (1)2.5 (2)1.1 (1)1.0 (1)1.1 (1)3.6 (3)2.1 (2)10.9 (12)TrpPhe2.3 (2)0.8 (1)2.3 (1)1.0 (1)0.9 (1)4.0 (4)Lys0.7 (1)1.4 (1)0.8 (1)0.9 (1)1.0 (1)1.1 (1)0.7 (1)0.7 (1)0.8 (1)2.1 (2)1.8 (2)7.6 (6)HisTyr0.7 (1)0.7 (1)0.6 (1)3.1 (4)1.6 (2)1.9 (2)0.8 (1)1.9 (2)0.5 (1)2.4 (2)3.1 (3)0.5 (1)10.7 (10)Total674121492082191319131615744296195TOF-MS7641.74601.32503.85754.02207.5937.42346.61076.21659.92081.51579.81951.91777.4719.24970.83366.9670.821376.5M r(7630.4)(4604.0)(2502.7)(5747.3)(2205.4)(935.0)(2345.2)(1077.3)(1656.8)(2077.2)(1583.8)(1948.2)(1776.0)(718.7)(4964.5)(3369.7)(670.7)(21394.1)Values are expressed as residues/molecule by analysis or, in parentheses, from the sequence in FIG. 7.a L and V demonstrate the peptides generated by cleavage of the CAM protein with Achromobacter protease I andS. aureus V8 protease, respectively.b S-Carboxamidomethyl-cysteine was determined as S-carboxymethyl-cysteine (CM) by amino acid analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2011499712,"Adducin is a protein associated with spectrin and actin in membrane skeletons of erythrocytes and possibly other cells. Adducin has activities in in vitro assays of association with the sides of actin filaments, capping the fast growing ends of actin filaments, and recruiting spectrin to actin filaments. This study presents evidence that adducin exhibits a preference for the fast growing ends of actin filaments for recruiting spectrin to actin and for direct association with actin. β-Adducin-(335–726) promoted recruitment of spectrin to gelsolin-sensitive sites at fast growing ends of actin filaments with half-maximal activity at 15 nmand to gelsolin-insensitive sites with half-maximal activity at 75 nm. β-Adducin-(335–726) also exhibited a preference for actin filament ends in direct binding assays; the half-maximal concentration for binding of adducin to gelsolin-sensitive sites at filament ends was 60 nm, and the K d for binding to lateral sites was 1.5 μm. The concentration of β-adducin-(335–726) of 60 nm required for half-maximal binding to filament ends is in the same range as the concentration of 150 nm required for half-maximal actin capping activity. All interactions of adducin with actin require the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate-related domain as well as a newly defined oligomerization site localized in the neck domain of adducin. Surprisingly, the head domain of adducin is not required for spectrin-actin interactions, although it could play a role in forming tetramers. The relative activities of adducin imply that an important role of adducin in cells is to form a complex with the fast growing ends of actin filaments that recruits spectrin and prevents addition or loss of actin subunits. Adducin is a protein associated with spectrin and actin in membrane skeletons of erythrocytes and possibly other cells. Adducin has activities in in vitro assays of association with the sides of actin filaments, capping the fast growing ends of actin filaments, and recruiting spectrin to actin filaments. This study presents evidence that adducin exhibits a preference for the fast growing ends of actin filaments for recruiting spectrin to actin and for direct association with actin. β-Adducin-(335–726) promoted recruitment of spectrin to gelsolin-sensitive sites at fast growing ends of actin filaments with half-maximal activity at 15 nmand to gelsolin-insensitive sites with half-maximal activity at 75 nm. β-Adducin-(335–726) also exhibited a preference for actin filament ends in direct binding assays; the half-maximal concentration for binding of adducin to gelsolin-sensitive sites at filament ends was 60 nm, and the K d for binding to lateral sites was 1.5 μm. The concentration of β-adducin-(335–726) of 60 nm required for half-maximal binding to filament ends is in the same range as the concentration of 150 nm required for half-maximal actin capping activity. All interactions of adducin with actin require the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate-related domain as well as a newly defined oligomerization site localized in the neck domain of adducin. Surprisingly, the head domain of adducin is not required for spectrin-actin interactions, although it could play a role in forming tetramers. The relative activities of adducin imply that an important role of adducin in cells is to form a complex with the fast growing ends of actin filaments that recruits spectrin and prevents addition or loss of actin subunits. The ubiquitous expression of spectrin and spectrin-associated proteins in most cells of metazoan organisms raises the issue of how spectrin-based structures are assembled and regulated. The erythrocyte membrane skeleton is the best characterized example of a spectrin-actin network, although spectrin also is associated with membranes at sites of cell-cell contact in epithelial cells, along axons in the nervous system, and at specialized sites in striated muscle (1Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 7-66Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Spectrin in erythrocytes is organized into a polygonal network formed by 5–7 spectrin molecules linked to short actin filaments about 40 nm in length (2Byers T.J. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6153-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 3Shen B.W. Josephs R. Steck T.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 4Liu S.-C. Derick L.H. Palek J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Spectrin-actin junctions contain a group of proteins that presumably have functions in promoting spectrin-actin interactions, forming connections with the membrane, and regulation of actin filament length (1Bennett V. Gilligan D.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 7-66Crossref Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 5Fowler V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 86-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Adducin is one of the proteins localized at spectrin-actin junctions (6Derick L.H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Palek J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 317-320PubMed Google Scholar) and was originally purified based on calmodulin binding activity (7Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adducin also is a substrate for protein kinase C and protein kinase A (8Ling E. Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol.

Adducin phosphorylated at the major protein kinase C site is localized in dendritic spines and axonal growth cones of cultured neurons, indicating adducin is a protein kinase C substratein vivo (11Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Adducin is encoded by three closely related genes termed α, β, and γ adducins which are expressed in many types of cells (7Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Fowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Adducins all contain an N-terminal globular head domain, a neck domain, and a protease-sensitive tail domain with a C-terminal basic stretch of 22 amino acids with homology to the MARCKS 1The abbreviations used are: MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DTT, dithiothreitol; EZ-LinkTM Biotin-BMCC, 1-biotinamido-4-[4′-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamido] butane; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate. 1The abbreviations used are: MARCKS, myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate; DSP, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate); DTT, dithiothreitol; EZ-LinkTM Biotin-BMCC, 1-biotinamido-4-[4′-(maleimidomethyl)cyclohexanecarboxamido] butane; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate. protein (9Dong L.

Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MARCKS-related domain of adducin contains the major sites for both protein kinase C phosphorylation and calmodulin binding (10Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25157-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Adducin is a mixture of heterodimers and heterotetramers in solution, with tetramers formed by four head domains in contact with one another to form a globular core, and interacting tail domains extending away from the core (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Adducin oligomers in erythrocytes comprise α/β subunits and in other cells include α/γ as well as α/β combinations of subunits (7Gardner K. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1339-1348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dong L. Chapline C. Mousseau B. Fowler L. Ramsay K. Stevens J.L. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25534-25540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The patterns of expression and cellular localization of adducin are consistent with a role in interaction with spectrin in erythrocytes as well as other cells. Adducin is localized at spectrin-actin junctions in mature erythrocytes (6Derick L.H. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Palek J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 57: 317-320PubMed Google Scholar) and is expressed early in erythropoiesis at a time when the spectrin-actin network is forming (15Nehls V. Drenckhahn D. Joshi R. Bennett V. Blood. 1991; 78: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adducin and spectrin are both concentrated at sites of cell-cell contact in epithelial tissues and at dendritic spines and axon growth cones of cultured neurons (11Matsuoka Y. Li X. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kaiser H.W. O'Keefe E. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 557-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Expression of a dominant-negative form of spectrin that inhibits assembly of spectrin tetramers results in loss of epithelial polarity and disassociation of adducin from the plasma membrane (17Hu R.J. Moorthy S. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Hts, an adducin-related protein inDrosophila, is required for the formation of ring canals, an actin-rich structure, and is co-localized with spectrin in developing germline cells (18Yue L. Spradling A.C. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2443-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Lin H. Yue L. Sprading A.C. Development. 1994; 120: 947-956PubMed Google Scholar). Spectrin and adducin also have been observed associated with a dynactin complex which contains an actin-related protein (20Holleran E.A. Tokito M.K. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1815-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Adducin activities determined in in vitro assays include recruiting spectrin to actin filaments (21Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Bennett V. Gardner K. Steiner J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bundling actin filaments (23Mische S.M. Mooseker M.S. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2837-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 24Taylor K.A. Taylor D.W. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 1976-1983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and capping the fast growing ends of actin filaments (25Kuhlman P.A. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7986-7991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Each of these individual adducin activities may reflect different aspects of adducin function in living cells. In this study we have quantitated the relative affinities of adducin for actin capping, direct binding to actin, as well as recruiting spectrin to the sides and fast growing ends of actin filaments. The conclusion of these experiments is that adducin preferentially associates with and recruits spectrin to the fast growing ends of actin filaments. We also demonstrate that adducin interactions with spectrin and actin require the MARCKS-related domain of adducin as well as a newly defined oligomerization site localized in the neck domain of adducin. EZ-LinkTM Biotin-BMCC, NeutrAvidin, and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) were from Pierce. Electrophoresis reagents and the Bradford protein assay solution were from Bio-Rad. Epoxide-modified microspheres (0.35 μm diameter; MMA/GMA copolymer) were from Bangs Laboratories. Standard microcentrifuge tubes (400 μl) were from Eppendorf. 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent was from ICN Radiochemicals. Pepstatin A, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and benzamidine were from Sigma. Uranyl acetate was from Electron Microscopy Sciences. Copper grids (400 mesh) were from Mason & Morton Ltd. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride was from Boehringer Mannheim. S-Sepharose resin and Mono Q columns were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Protein concentration was determined by the procedure of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using 0.2% SDS with buffers of Fairbanks et al.(27Fairbanks G. Steck T. Wallach D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2606-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6168) Google Scholar) on 1.5-mm thick 3.5–17% exponential gradient gels. Quantitation of proteins by the pyridine dye elution method was basically as described (28Fenner C. Traut R.R. Mason D.T. Wikman-Coffelt J. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 63: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bands corresponding to the targeted proteins were cut out from the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the dyes were extracted in 25% pyridine. The relative amounts of protein were measured by reading the absorbance at 595 nm of dye/pyridine solution. Actin was purified from acetone powder of rabbit skeletal muscle (29Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 217-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with a modification that actin monomer was isolated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 column before the final polymerization step. Bovine brain spectrin was isolated following high salt extraction from brain membranes (30Davis J. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7757-7766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Red blood cell adducin was purified from the low salt extract of human erythrocyte membranes as described previously (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Purified human plasma gelsolin was purchased from Cytoskeleton. Purified recombinant human plasma gelsolin expressed from Escherichia coli was a generous gift from Dr. Paul A. Janmey, Harvard Medical School, Boston. β-Adducin constructs were generated using full-length human β-adducin cDNA (12Joshi R. Gilligan D.M. Otto E. McLaughlin T. Bennett V. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) as a polymerase chain reaction template and were subcloned into a Studier plasmid with a T7 promoter (31Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). Each adducin polypeptide has three additional N-terminal amino acids (Met-Ala-Ser). Procedures for subcloning and bacterial expression of the constructs were as described (32Li X. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15695-15702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The expressed proteins were purified as follows. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 100 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 25% sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.04 mg/ml DNase I, and protease inhibitors including 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mmbenzamidine, 0.01 mg/ml pepstatin A. The suspension was mixed with 200 ml of extraction buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors as mentioned above. Subsequently the lysate was forced through a 20-gauge needle once and centrifuged for 20 min at 5,000 × g. The recombinant proteins were in the Triton-soluble fraction, which was then loaded onto a 15-ml S-Sepharose column. The protein was eluted with 0.5 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm DTT. Optimal column fractions were pooled and dialyzed against the same elution buffer but with 50 mmNaCl. The protein was loaded onto a 10-ml Mono Q high pressure liquid chromatography column and eluted by a linear 0.05–0.5 mNaCl gradient. Generally, a 2-liter culture can result in 5–10 mg of protein with over 90% purity. Purified F-actin was incubated with EZ-LinkTM Biotin-BMCC for 5 h with a 5:1 molar ratio of biotin versus actin. Then the biotinylated F-actin was depolymerized by dialysis for 48 h against G buffer containing 2 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT. Avidin beads were prepared as follows. NeutrAvidin was coupled to epoxide-beads for 48 h in a coupling buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm sodium EGTA, 1 mm NaN3. The reaction was quenched by a buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNaN3 and then the beads were washed twice with coupling buffer. Subsequently the biotinylated and depolymerized actin was incubated with avidin beads at 4 °C for 5 h. The amount of actin bound to the beads (usually 4–9 μg per μl of packed beads) was monitored by measuring free actin before and after the coupling using Bradford assays. The immobilized actin were washed twice by a buffer containing 2 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT. In the final step, beads coupled actin and un-biotinylated actin monomer (with a ratio of 1:9) were co-polymerized in 2 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The co-sedimentation assay using free actin filaments was described previously (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22Bennett V. Gardner K. Steiner J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The co-sedimentation assay using immobilized actin was performed as follows. 125I-Labeled ligand (adducin or spectrin) was incubated with immobilized actin (0.4 μm actin) in a 60-μl volume for 1 h at 4 °C in a buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% sucrose, 0.05% Tween 20, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.5 mm NaN3. The incubated mixtures were then layered onto 200 μl of 20% sucrose dissolved in the same incubation buffer in 400-μl microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 × g. Supernatants and pellets were separated by freezing the tubes on dry ice and cutting the tips of the tubes. The radioactivity of both the supernatant and the pellets was analyzed with a gamma counter. The amount of actin in pellets was determined in parallel experiments under the same conditions. Pyrene-labeled actin was prepared as described (33Weber A. Northrop J. Bishop M.F. Ferrone F.A. Mooseker M.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2528-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). G buffer (2 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT) was used in all assays. The assay quantitated inhibition of actin polymerization at barbed ends utilizing the method of Pollard (34Pollard T.D. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 134: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) in which rapid polymerization was initiated using F-actin nuclei. Briefly, 4 μm G-actin was mixed with adducin, and actin polymerization was initiated by adding 0.25 volume of 1.25 μm F-actin nuclei in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2. Actin polymerization was followed by monitoring the increased pyrene fluorescence of labeled F-actin (excitation at 365 nm and emission of 407 nm) during 30–210 s after initiation of the polymerization using a spectrofluorimeter. The sample temperature was maintained at a constant 25 °C for all experiments using a circulating water bath. Immobilized actin or free actin in a buffer containing 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 50 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm NaN3was applied to a 400-mesh copper grid coated with carbon film for 30 s and washed by 10–20 drops of 1% uranyl acetate. The grid was then air-dried for 5 min and examined by a Philips EM 301 electron microscope. Adducin/actin/spectrin interactions were previously monitored by a binding assay using actin filaments as the sedimentation matrices (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 21Gardner K. Bennett V. Nature. 1987; 328: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 22Bennett V. Gardner K. Steiner J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Li X. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15695-15702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that adducin caps the fast growing ends of actin filaments (25Kuhlman P.A. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7986-7991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In order to evaluate directly interactions of adducin with actin filament ends, we developed a technique for measuring binding to short actin filaments with relatively more ends than in the conventional assay. Biotinylated actin was coupled to avidin beads (referred to as “immobilized actin”). Beads were selected to be (a) impermeable to proteins to minimize the background due to trapping, (b) small (0.35 μm) to maximize surface/volume ratio, and (c) of appropriate density (1.1 g/ml) to sediment through a sucrose barrier. Immobilized actin sediments at 4,000 × g for 10 min, and free actin requires high centrifugation forces (up to 80,000 × g for 60 min) to pellet. Compared with the conventional assay using free actin, the immobilized actin assay can reduce the background that results from sedimentation of ligands independent of actin. The filament lengths of immobilized actin were compared with those of uncoupled actin filaments (referred to as “free actin” in this article). Fields of negatively stained immobilized actin contain much fewer extended actin filaments than a sample of free actin, even though both preparations contain equal concentrations of actin (Fig. 1 A). It suggests that immobilized actin has more short filaments which are coupled to the beads. Moreover, the number of actin filament ends are determined quantitatively by using gelsolin to cap the fast growing ends of actin filaments (35Yin H.L. Hartwig J.H. Maruyama K. Stossel T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9693-9697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin/gelsolin co-sedimentation was performed in a buffer at pH 7.0 and calcium-free to minimize actin filament severing activity of gelsolin (36Yin H.L. BioEssays. 1987; 7: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 37Lamb J.A. Allen P.G. Tuan B.Y. Janmey P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8999-9004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gelsolin does not bind to beads alone but binds to immobilized actin with a ratio of approximately 1 gelsolin/15 actin monomers (Fig. 1 C, lanes 3 and4). In contrast, gelsolin binds to free actin with a ratio below 1 gelsolin/250 actin subunits (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and 2), suggesting much fewer filaments ends available in free actin samples. The immobilized actin assay produces results consistent with those of free actin assay but with a dramatically high signal expressed in terms of signal per actin subunit (Fig. 2). Spectrin recruiting activity of adducin was half-maximal at 50 nm adducin for both free actin and the immobilized actin co-sedimentation assay. This affinity for spectrin recruitment of adducin is also comparable with values measured previously (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, adducin in the immobilized actin assay exhibited a 15–20 times higher signal per actin subunit than the free actin assay. The results support our design of immobilized actin as a tool to study interactions that are related to the ends of actin filaments. Contributions of individual domains to adducin function were evaluated using recombinant polypeptides expressed in bacteria (Fig. 3). We focused on β-adducin as an initial step and have confirmed the major findings with α-adducin. The domain boundaries of adducin subunits were inferred from patterns of polypeptides produced by limited proteolytic digestion of erythrocyte and brain adducin (13Joshi R. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13130-13136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bennett V. Gardner K. Steiner J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5860-5869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mild chymotryptic digestion of adducin yields an N-terminal fragment of 48 kDa (residues 1–436), whereas tryptic digestion produces an N-terminal fragment of 39 kDa (residues 1–354), implying a chymotrypsin-resistant domain of 80 residues (355–435) which is referred to as the neck domain. Twenty additional N-terminal residues were added to constructs encompassing the neck domain to compensate for possible errors in estimates of molecular weight by SDS-electrophoresis (Fig. 3). The tail construct (residues 409–726) designed previously by Hughes and Bennett (14Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18990-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) lacks most of the neck domain. Thus β-adducin residues 335–436 and 437–726 are designated to be the neck and the tail domains, respectively, and were expressed in bacteria with a three amino acid addition at the N terminus but otherwise no additional residues (see “Methods”). The head domain (residues 1–354) was not included due to the limited solubility when expressed in bacteria (data not shown). Activities of β-adducin polypeptides were compared with native erythrocyte adducin in recruitment of spectrin to actin filaments (Fig. 4) and preventing polymerization of actin (Fig. 5). β-Adducin-(335–726) and native erythrocyte adducin exhibited an equivalent binding extent and binding affinity (half-maximal at 50 nm) of spectrin recruiting activity expressed per adducin polypeptide chain (Fig. 4). The capping activities of adducin domains were studied by the pyrene actin polymerization assay (Fig. 5). β-Adducin-(335–726) blocked 70–80% of the actin polymerization, an extent similar with that of native erythrocyte adducin. However, the estimatedK cap for β-335–726 is 150 nm, and the K cap of erythrocyte adducin is about 80 nm. Both values are within the range ofK cap = 100 nm (calculated for adducin dimers) of erythrocyte adducin in the previous report (25Kuhlman P.A. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. Fowler V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7986-7991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).Figure 5Actin capping activity of native adducin and β-adducin recombinant polypeptides. A, raw data. F-actin seeds and salt initiated the filament elongation after adducin or adducin polypeptides (1 μm) were pre-mixed with actin monomers. The increasing pyrene fluorescence versus time was monitored (see “Experimental Procedures”).

The neck-tail of α-adducin, the counterpart of β-adducin-(335–726), exhibited similar spectrin recruiting and actin capping activities (not shown). An experimental benefit of activity of the neck-tail polypeptides is that these recombinant proteins could be employed as an equivalent of native adducin for further analysis of adducin structure and function. β-Adducin-(335–694), which lacks the MARCKS-related domain, almost completely lacked activity in promoting association of spectrin with actin filaments (Fig. 4). β-Adducin-(335–694) also exhibited an 80% reduction in the extent of actin capping activity (Fig. 5) and in actin binding activity (Fig. 6 A). The residual activities of β-adducin-(335–694) in actin capping and actin binding assays are in the range of nonspecific effects. The MARCKS-related domain is not sufficient for activities, however, since a construct, β-adducin residues 437–726, with the MARCKS-related domain and the rest of the tail, but lacking the neck domain, also exhibited minimal spectrin recruiting activity, actin capping activity, and actin binding activity (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). These experiments are the first evidence that the MARCKS-related region is necessary (but not sufficient) for adducin functions. A role for this domain is consistent with the previous findings that calmodulin, which binds to the MARCKS-related domain (10Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol.

We now report that arachidonic acid stimulated the appearance of dual-phosphorylated (active) p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase as detected by Western blotting in HeLa cells, HL60 cells, human neutrophils, and human umbilical vein endothelial cells but not Jurkat cells. An increase in p38 kinase activity caused by arachidonic acid was also observed. Further studies with neutrophils show that the stimulation of p38 dual phosphorylation by arachidonic acid was transient, peaking at 5 min, and was concentration-dependent. The effect of arachidonic acid was not affected by either nordihydroguaiaretic acid, an inhibitor of the 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenases or by indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase. Arachidonic acid also stimulated the phosphorylation and/or activity of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and of c-jun N-terminal kinase in a cell-type-specific manner. An examination of the mechanisms through which arachidonic acid stimulated the phosphorylation/activity of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase in neutrophils revealed an involvement of protein kinase C.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 1-2Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). In in vitro assays, 20:4ω6 and other polyunsaturated fatty acids have been demonstrated to stimulate the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) (2Murakami K.

Science. 1984; 224: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). When added exogenously, 20:4ω6 is biologically active in a wide spectrum of cells. For example, 20:4ω6 has been reported to inhibit gap junctional permeability between adherent cells (4Hii C.S.T. Ferrante A. Schmidt S. Rathjen D.A. Robinson B.S. Poulos A Murray A.W.

Blood. 1994; 84: 3799-3809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms through which the actions of 20:4ω6 are mediated are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated that 20:4ω6 and other polyunsaturated fatty acids stimulate the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in WB rat liver epithelial cells (15Hii C.S.T. Ferrante A. Edwards Y. Huang Z.H. Hartfield P.J. Rathjen D.A. Poulos A. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4201-4204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), suggesting that ERK may mediate some of the biological actions of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Others have reported that arachidonic acid and its metabolites stimulate ERK activity in smooth muscle cells (16Rao G.N. Baas A.S. Glascow W.C. Eling T.E. Runge M.S. Alexander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32586-32591Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ERK and the closely related p38 and jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) are members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family of kinases (17Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). These kinases are activated when cells are exposed to growth factors, cytokines, and/or various forms of stress (17Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 18Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases are achieved through the dual phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine residues in the TXY motif by upstream MAP kinase kinases. MAP kinases have been proposed to regulate a diverse range of biological functions, including cytokine production and cell growth, differentiation, and death (17Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 18Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Although 20:4ω6 has recently been reported to stimulate the activity of JNK in proximal tubular epithelial cells and in stromal cells (19Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3771-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Rizzo M.T. Carlo-Stella C. Blood. 1996; 88: 3792-3800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we are not aware of any studies that have investigated whether 20:4ω6 affects the activity of p38. We now report the novel finding that 20:4ω6 stimulated the dual phosphorylation of p38 in HeLa cells, HL60 cells, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human neutrophils but not in Jurkat T cells. Further characterization in neutrophils demonstrated that 20:4ω6 also stimulated the phosphorylation/activity of ERK but not of JNK, although the activity of JNK was weakly stimulated by 20:4ω6 in Jurkat cells. 20:4ω6 also stimulated the translocation of a number of PKC isozymes to a particulate fraction in neutrophils. The effect of 20:4ω6 on p38 and ERK dual phosphorylation/activity was partially blocked by GF109203X, a specific inhibitor of PKC. These data demonstrate that the ability of 20:4ω6 to stimulate the activity of p38 and JNK is cell type-dependent and suggest that p38, ERK, JNK, and PKC are potential mediators of the biological actions of 20:4ω6. Fatty acids, 20:4ω6, formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), myelin basic protein, kinase A peptide inhibitor, protein A-Sepharose, and general reagents for kinase assays were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 4000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Bresatec, Adelaide, Australia. The anti-ERK antibody, R2, was a kind gift from Dr. S. Pelech, University of British Columbia, or was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY. Rabbit anti-p38 and anti-JNK1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotech. The anti-ACTIVETM ERK and p38 antibodies were obtained from Promega Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) solutions and reinforced nitrocellulose were from NEN Life Science Products and Schleicher and Schuell, respectively. Glutathione-Sepharose beads was from Pharmacia Biotech, Australia. Fatty acids, PMA, and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine were dissolved in ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and Me2SO, respectively. The final concentrations of the vehicles were: ethanol, 0.1% (v/v) and Me2SO, 0.1% (v/v). Control cells received vehicle(s) alone. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbeco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of fetal calf serum (10%) and antibiotics as described previously (21Hii C.S.T. Edwards Y.S. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20238-20243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (0.25 × 106) were plated in 10-cm culture dishes and were used after 4 days. HL60 and Jurkat T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented fetal calf serum with and antibiotics at ≤1 × 106/ml. All cells were washed once with Hanks' balanced salts solution (HBSS) 30 min before being incubated with 20:4ω6 or vehicle. Human neutrophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers by the rapid single-step method of Ferrante and Thong (22Ferrante A. Thong Y.H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1982; 48: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The preparation of neutrophils was of >98% purity and >99% viability as judged by morphological examination of cytospin preparations and the ability of viable cells to exclude trypan blue. Cells in HBSS were incubated in the presence of 20:4ω6 for the times indicated. Incubations were terminated by removing the incubation medium and washing the cells once with HBSS (4 °C). For p38 and JNK assays, cells were lysed in 150 μl of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and benzamidine) for 2 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min), the supernatants were collected for kinase assay or for Western blotting as described below. Activation of ERK was determined by a kinase assay and by Western blotting. Pelleted cells were sonicated (3 × 10 s, output of 2 units, Soniprobe) in buffer B (25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 38 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatants (termed cytosolic fractions) were collected for Western blotting as described below or for kinase assay. Before the kinase assay, cytosolic fractions were batch-adsorbed onto phenyl-Sepharose CL4B. After washing the beads with 10% (2×) and 35% (2×) ethylene glycol in buffer A (v/v), ERK was eluted with 60% ethylene glycol (23Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that phenyl-Sepharose-adsorbed ERK1 and ERK2 are eluted between 35 and 60% ethylene glycol (23Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The activity of ERK was assayed as described below. To study PKC translocation, neutrophils were sonicated in buffer C (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and benzamidine). After incubating on ice for 30 min, samples were centrifuged (100,000 ×g, 30 min), and the pellets were resuspended in Buffer C containing 2% Triton X-100. After a 30-min incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min), the supernatant was mixed with Laemmli buffer, and PKC isozymes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with isozyme-specific anti-PKC antibodies as described below. p38 was immunoprecipitated before determination of kinase activity. Briefly, lysates (700 μg of protein) were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (15 μl/sample). Anti-p38 antibody (3 μg/sample) was added, and tubes were incubated with constant mixing for 90 min at 4 °C. The antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (20 μl/sample). The immunoprecipitates were washed once with buffer A and once with assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 3.8 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm Na3VO4, and 20 μm ATP) at 4 °C. The assay was started by adding 30 μl of assay buffer (30 °C) containing 10 μCi of γ32P-ATP, 3.8 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, and 15 μg of myelin basic protein. After 15 min, the assay was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min at 100 °C. Phosphorylated myelin basic protein was resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was detected and quantitated using an Instant Imager (Packard Instruments). A solid phase assay was used to assay JNK activity as described previously (24Sakata N. Patel H.R. Terada N. Aruffo A. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30823-30828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, glutathioneS-transferase-jun (1–79) fusion protein was purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose beads at 4 °C with gentle rocking. 1 mg of lysate protein, 15 mmMgCl2, and 10 μm ATP were added to 25 μl (packed volume) of glutathione S-transferase-jun (1–79) coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. After centrifugation (16,000 × g, 5 min), the beads were washed once with buffer A, once with wash buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, and the protease inhibitors, which were added to buffer A) and once with assay buffer (see p38 above). The assay was started by adding 35 μl assay buffer containing 8 μCi of γ32P-ATP and bringing the temperature to 30 °C. After 20 min, the assay was terminated by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min at 100 °C. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and detection and quantitation of phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase-jun (1–79) was as described above. ERK activity was assayed as described previously (12DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1590-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar,23Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar) by monitoring the incorporation of 32Piinto myelin basic protein in the presence of EGTA and protein kinase A peptide inhibitor. The assay mixture did not contain added phospholipids. Assays were terminated by spotting aliquots of the reaction mixture onto P81 filter paper. After 3 washes (5 min each) with 75 mm orthophosphoric acid, radioactivity associated with the paper was determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. There was no detectable protein kinase A activity in phenyl-Sepharose-purified fractions, since omission of the protein kinase A peptide inhibitor from the assay mixture did not result in increased phosphorylation of myelin basic protein (Ref. 23Anderson N.G. Maller J.L. Tonks N.K. Sturgill T.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar and data not shown). Active p38, if present in the fractions, was unlikely to contribute to any significant degree toward the total myelin basic protein kinase activity because the time course of ERK activity did not correlate with the appearance of dual-phosphorylated p38 (see “Results”). Consequently, it is unlikely that PKC, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases, p38, or protein kinase A were responsible for phosphorylating myelin basic protein in these samples. Denatured proteins were separated on either 10 (ERK and p38) or 12% (PKC) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (100 V, 1.5 h), and immunoreaction and detection were carried out as described earlier (25Hii C.S.T. Oh S.Y. Schmidt S. Clark K.J. Murray A.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immediately after transfer, blots were stained with Ponceau S (0.1% in 5% acetic acid) to confirm equal loading of all lanes of the gels. Affinity-purified polyclonal anti-ERK antibody, R2, anti-ACTIVETM ERK, or anti-ACTIVETM p38 antibody and anti-PKC isozyme-specific antibodies were used to detect ERK isoforms, dual-phosphorylated ERK, dual phosphorylated p38, and PKC isozymes, respectively. Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (25Hii C.S.T. Oh S.Y. Schmidt S. Clark K.J. Murray A.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Where appropriate, differences were analyzed by analysis of variance or unpaired Student's t test and were considered significant when p < 0.05. Incubation of HeLa cells, HL60 cells, and human neutrophils with 20:4ω6 (20 μm) for 4 min resulted in the dual phosphorylation of p38 as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 1). Similar results were obtained in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (data not shown). Ponceau S staining confirmed that, within a particular experiment, the individual lanes were loaded with equal amounts of proteins (data not shown). Since the anti-ACTIVE™ p38 antibody only detects p38 that had been dual phosphorylated on the TGY activation motif, these results indicate activation of p38 by 20:4ω6. Kinase activity assays in neutrophils confirmed this (Fig. 1). In contrast to the above data, 20:4ω6 did not enhance p38 dual phosphorylation in Jurkat cells (data not shown) that express p38 (26Crawley J.B. Rawlinson L. Lali F.V. Page T.H. Saklatvala J. Foxwell B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15023-15027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Our previous studies in human neutrophils have demonstrated that 20:4ω6 stimulated superoxide production, degranulation, and adherence to plastic surfaces and increased the expression of CD11b/CD18 (5Poulos A. Robinson B.S. Ferrante A. Harvey D.P. Hardy S.J. Murray A.W. Immunology. 1991; 73: 102-108PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bates E.J. Ferrante A. Smithers L. Poulos A. Robinson B.R.

Leucocyte Biol. 1993; 53: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms through which 20:4ω6 exerted these actions, the effects of 20:4ω6 on MAP kinases were studied in more detail in the neutrophils. 20:4ω6 stimulated the dual phosphorylation of p38 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). Thus, dual-phosphorylated p38 could be detected at 5 μm 20:4ω6, and phosphorylation increased with increasing concentrations of 20:4ω6 up to 20 μm, the maximum concentration tested (Fig. 2 a). Stimulation of p38 dual phosphorylation, detectable at less than 2 min, was transient, peaking at 5 min after exposure to 20:4ω6 (Fig. 2 b). Very little dual-phosphorylated p38 was left at 10 min after the addition of 20:4ω6. The ability of 20:4ω6 to stimulate dual phosphorylation of p38 was not diminished by either nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a broad spectrum inhibitor of the 5-, 12-, and 15-lipoxygenase or by indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (Fig. 3). A small amount of dual-phosphorylated p38 was detected in neutrophils that had been exposed to either nordihydroguaiaretic acid or indomethacin per se. This was likely to be due to the accumulation of low levels of endogenous 20:4ω6 in the presence of nordihydroguaiaretic acid or indomethacin.Figure 3Lack of effect of nordihydroguaiaretic acid or indomethacin on the appearance of dual phosphorylated p38.Neutrophils were preincubated for 10 min with either nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) (10 μm) or indomethacin (100 μm) before being exposed to 20:4ω6. Samples were prepared and Western blotted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined whether 20:4ω6 also stimulated the activity of JNK in human neutrophils. Although 20:4ω6 has been reported to stimulate the activity of JNK in stromal and rabbit proximal tubular epithelial cells (19Cui X.L. Douglas J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3771-3776Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 20Rizzo M.T. Carlo-Stella C. Blood. 1996; 88: 3792-3800Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the fatty acid did not stimulate JNK activity in neutrophils (data not shown). This was not because neutrophils do not express JNK, because the presence of JNK1 was detected in neutrophils (data not shown). However, 20:4ω6 stimulated the activity of JNK in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4), although the degree of activation was less than that observed with A23187/PMA (Fig. 4). ω3 fatty acids also stimulated JNK activity in Jurkat cells (data not shown). Although we have previously demonstrated that 20:4ω6 stimulated the activity of ERK in WB rat liver cells (12DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1590-1598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), the effect of 20:4ω6 on ERK activity in neutrophils has not been reported. Because the above data demonstrate that 20:4ω6 stimulated the dual phosphorylation of p38 and the activity of JNK in a cell type-specific manner, it is, therefore, important to determine whether the activity of ERK in neutrophils is affected by 20:4ω6.

Incubation of neutrophils with 20:4ω6 caused a retardation in the electrophoretic mobility of the 42- and 43-kDa forms of ERK to give apparent M r values of 43- and 44-kDa (Fig. 5 a), consistent with their activation by phosphorylation. When the fractions were Western-blotted with anti-ACTIVETM ERK antibody that detects active, dual-phosphorylated ERK, two bands withM r values of approximately 43-and 44-kDa were detected predominantly in samples from 20:4ω6-stimulated cells (Fig. 5 b). Kinase assays demonstrate that the enhancement of ERK activity by 20:4ω6 was concentration-dependent. An increase in kinase activity was detectable at 5 μm20:4ω6, the lowest concentration tested (Fig. 6 a). The effect of 20:4ω6 peaked at around 15 min after the addition of 20:4ω6 (Fig. 6 b) and was longer lasting than stimulation of p38 dual phosphorylation or activity (Fig. 2 b). This argues strongly against the possibility that contaminating p38, which also phosphorylates myelin basic protein (Fig. 1 b), was responsible for phosphorylating myelin basic protein in these fractions, since the appearance of dual-phosphorylated p38 peaked at 5 min after the addition of 20:4ω6 and declined rapidly thereafter. 20:4ω6 also stimulated the activity of ERK in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, human mesangial cells, Jurkat cells, HL60 cells, and human monocytes but not in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (data not shown). The activity of ERK in these cells was also stimulated by the ω3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5ω3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6ω3) (data not shown).Figure 6The activity of ERK in neutrophils was stimulated in a concentration- and time-dependent manner by 20:4ω6. Neutrophils were incubated with 20:4ω6 at the concentrations indicated for 10 min (a) or for the times indicated (b, control (○); 20 μm 20:4ω6 (•)). ERK in cytosolic fractions was partially purified, and the activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are the mean ± S.E. of three determinations (a) or the mean of duplicate determinations (b).

Leszczynska-Piziak J. Weissman G. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 231-236PubMed Google Scholar), the effect of fatty acids on PKC translocation in neutrophils has not been reported. In unstimulated neutrophils, a substantial amount of PKC βII was detected in a particulate fraction, and this was increased after incubation with 20:4ω6 (Fig. 7). The existence of particulate fraction-associated PKC in unstimulated cells has also been observed in the T lymphocyte cell line, CTLL-2 (33Lu Y. Tremblay R. Jouishomme H. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1495-1504PubMed Google Scholar). 20:4ω6 also caused a small amount of PKC α and βI to associate with the particulate fraction (Fig. 7). Neither PKC δ nor ζ was detected in the particulate fraction (data not shown). An involvement of PKC in the activation of MAP kinases by 20:4ω6 was confirmed by the observation that GF109203X, an inhibitor of classical PKC isozymes (34Toullec D. Pianetti D. Coste H.

We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with its cytoplasmic domain and play a role in CD5 proximal signaling events. We found that the β subunit of the serine/threonine kinase casein kinase 2 (CK2) interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic domain of CD5. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed activation-independent association of CK2 with CD5 in human and murine B and T cell lines and murine splenocytes. The interaction of CK2 holoenzyme with CD5 is mediated by the amino terminus of the regulatory subunit β. CK2 binds and phosphorylates CD5 at the CK2 motifs flanked by Ser459 and Ser461. Cross-linking of CD5 leads to the activation of CD5-associated CK2 in a murine B-lymphoma cell line and a human T-leukemia cell line and is independent of net recruitment of CK2 to CD5. In contrast, CK2 is not activated following cross-linking of the B cell receptor complex or the T cell receptor complex. This direct regulation of CK2 by a cell surface receptor provides a novel pathway for control of cell activation that could play a significant role in regulation of CD5-dependent antigen receptor activation in T and B cells.

The serine/threonine sites include four CK2-dependent serine phosphorylation sites and a protein kinase C-dependent threonine phosphorylation site. TCR cross-linking leads to rapid tyrosine phosphorylation followed by serine/threonine phosphorylation of CD5 (14Lankester A.C. van Schijndel G.M. Cordell J.L. van Noesel C.J. van Lier R.A. Eur. J.

In contrast, CD5 ligation leads to tyrosine kinase activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates but only to serine phosphorylation of its own cytoplasmic domain (25Burgess K.E.

CD5 can associate with p56lck and Zap70, but it is unknown if these tyrosine kinases are involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of CD5 in cells (27Raab M. Yamamoto M. Rudd C.E. Mol. Cell.

Places L. Aussel C. Lozano F. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 4307-4315PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that in mature T cells, CD5 functions as a co-stimulatory molecule of T cell activation. In contrast, CD5 appears to attenuate TCR-CD3-induced signals in thymocytes (37Tarakhovsky A. Kanner S.B. Hombach J. Ledbetter J.A. Müller W. Killeen N. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Single positive thymocytes from CD5-deficient mice exhibit enhanced proliferation to TCR-CD3-induced signals, with hyperphosphorylation of Vav and phospholipase C-γ, and enhanced intracellular calcium mobilization. In mature B1a B cells, CD5 appears to function as a negative regulator of BCR-induced signals (38Bikah G. Carey J. Ciallella J.R. Tarakhovsky A. Bondada S. Science. 1996; 274: 1906-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The basis of these opposing effects of CD5 signaling in immature and in mature thymocytes is unclear. To define the molecules that may interact with CD5 and play a role in CD5-proximal signaling, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. The entire 94-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of human CD5, Y378-L471, was fused to the GAL4 binding domain (BD) and used as a “bait” to screen an GAL4 activation domain (AD) cDNA library prepared from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Using this approach, we show that casein kinase 2 (CK2), a serine/threonine kinase, interacts specifically with the cytoplasmic domain of CD5. The interaction of CK2 with CD5 is constitutive in human and mouse cell lines and murine splenocytes and is mediated by the regulatory β subunit of the tetrameric CK2 holoenzyme. We have mapped the CK2 binding and phosphorylation sites on CD5 to the two carboxyl-terminal CK2 motifs and have demonstrated CD5-dependent activation of CK2 in both B and T cell lines. This recruitment of a novel signaling pathway by CD5 is likely to have significant implications for CD5-dependent regulation of TCR- and BCR-induced activation. Murine B-lymphoma cell lines CH12 (gift from Dr. John. F. Kearney) and NYC31 (gift from Dr. Hans-Martin Jäck), and the human T-leukemia cell line Jurkat (gift from Dr. Louis B.

Murine spleens were obtained from 6–8-week-old Balb/c mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Anti-mouse CD5 mAb (clone 53–7.3), anti-human CD3 (clone UCHT1), and anti-human CD19 (clone HIB19) were obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal anti-CD5 rabbit serum to the conserved peptide sequence, TASHVDNEYSQPPR, in the CD5 cytoplasmic domain was a gift from Drs. Greg Appleyard and Bruce Wilkie (39Appleyard G. Wilkie B. Clin.

Goat anti-rabbit μ, F(ab′)2 fraction, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Protein A-agarose and protein G-agarose were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate was obtained from Pierce. Anti-mouse CD5 was conjugated to agarose using the EDC kit from Pierce. The CD5-derived peptide DNSSDSYDLHGAQRL, containing the CD5 cytoplasmic domain residues 456–471, was obtained from Bio Synthesis (Lewisville, TX), and the standard CK2 substrate peptide RRREEETEEE was obtained from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Purified CK2 was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. To generate the GAL4 binding domain-CD5 cytoplasmic domain (BD-CD5) fusion, we amplified by polymerase chain reaction the cDNA representing the 94-amino acid cytoplasmic domain (Tyr378–Leu471) from the CD5 cDNA clone, pT2–2 (15Jones N.H.

After determining the accuracy of the nucleotide sequence by fluorescent dye terminator sequencing (ABI, Foster City, CA), the construct was transformed into the HF7c yeast strain as suggested by the manufacturer (CLONTECH Matchmaker™). The BD-CD5 was screened for nonspecific activation of the GAL4 promoter directly and in association with a co-transformed irrelevant AD-cDNA construct provided. The BD-CD5 construct was used to screen an AD-cDNA library made with mRNA from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed pooled human peripheral blood lymphocytes in the pACT AD vector (40Staudinger J. Perry M. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Biochem. 1993; 268: 4608-4611Google Scholar). Colonies positive for growth on histidine-deficient plates were screened for LacZ expression using the filter assay on Whatman 5 filters. The generation of AD-CK2α, AD-CK2α′, AD-CK2β2–215, AD-CK2β2–132, and AD-CK2β133–215 constructs has been described previously (41Gietz R.D. Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J.

This system makes use of the type II restriction enzyme EamI to generate restriction-site independent deletions. The six primers used to generate all the deletions are as follows: 1) 5′-TCCTCTTCTGACAACCCCACAGCCTCC-3′, 2) 5′-AGCTCTTCAGTCTCGGACGGTTGCCGT-3′, 3) 5′-TCCTCTTCGGACAACGAATACAGCCAA-3′, 4) 5′-CACTCTTCAGTCGGCTGTGGGGTTCTC-3′, 5) 5′-TCCTCTTCTGACTATGATCTGCATGGG-3′, and 6) 5′-GTCTCTTCAGTCGTTGTCAGGCTGCAT-3′. The BD-CD5Δ415–417 construct was generated using primers 1 and 2, the BD-CD5Δ423–425 construct used primers 3 and 4, the BD-CD5Δ415–425 construct used primers 2 and 3, the BD-CD5Δ415–461 construct used primers 2 and 5, the BD-CD5Δ425–461 construct used primers 4 and 5, and the BD-CD5Δ458–461 construct used primers 5 and 6. Site-specific mutagenesis for constructing S459G and S461G single and double mutants of BD-CD5 was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The primers used were 5′-CAGCCTGACAACTCCGGCGACAGTGACTAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATAGTCACTGTCGCCGGAGTTGTCAGGCTG-3′ (antisense) for the S459G mutant, 5′-GACAACTCCTCCGACGGTGACTATGATCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGATCATAGTCACCGTCGGAGGAGTTGTC-3′ (antisense) for the S461G mutant, and 5′- CCTGACAACTCCGGCGACGGTGACTATGATCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGATCATAGTCACCGTCGCCGGAGTTGTCAGGCTG-3′ (antisense) for the S459G,S461G double mutant. To generate the pThioHis-CD5 fusion protein, the CD5 cytoplasmic domain cDNA was amplified using sense primer 5′-ATCGAATTCTACAAGAAGCTAGTGAAG-3′ and the BD-CD5 antisense primer and cloned in frame into the pThioHisA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Site-specific mutants S459A,S461A (single and double mutants) were constructed as described above for BD-CD5 Ser → Gly mutants except that the codons were changed to reflect Ser → Ala mutations. The absence of polymerase chain reaction-introduced artifacts and the presence of desired nucleotide changes were established by bidirectional nucleotide sequencing using dye terminator chemistry. Fusion proteins were prepared as described by Frangioni and Neel (43Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar), and His6-containing fusion proteins were purified with nickel-agarose beads (Probond, Invitrogen). The beads were washed with 20 mm phosphate buffer, 500 mm NaCl at pH 5.5 to remove nonspecifically absorbed proteins, and the bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm phosphate buffer, 500 mmNaCl, pH 4.0. After equilibration to pH 7.0 using 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, the fusion proteins were analyzed by silver stain of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and preparations containing one band of the appropriate molecular weight were used for subsequent experiments. Protein concentration was quantitated using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Cells (2 × 107) were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors (44D'Ambrosio D. Hippen K.L.

The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysate was precleared with protein A-agarose and Sepharose 4B. Lysates prepared from CH12, NYC31, or spleen cells were immunoprecipitated with agarose conjugated anti-mouse CD5 or agarose-conjugated rat IgG2a, and lysates from Jurkat cells were incubated with anti-human CD5 or anti-mouse CD19 (IgG1 isotype control) followed by precipitation with protein G-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using rabbit antiserum to CK2α followed by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate. Ten μg of the CK2 standard substrate peptide RRREEETEEE (45Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or synthetic CD5-derived peptide were incubated in 25 μl of kinase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 20 mmMgCl2, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). The reaction was initiated by addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5U CK2 (Boehringer Mannheim) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture was applied to a P-81 filter disc (Whatman) and washed extensively with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and radioactivity was determined in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman). For some experiments, pThioHisCD5 fusion proteins were used as the substrate in the in vitro kinase assay. For measurement of CK2 activity in immunoprecipitates, the immunoprecipitates from cells stimulated for 5 min with anti-CD5 mAb (20 μg/2 × 107 cells), F(ab′)2 anti-μ (10 μg/2 × 107 cells), anti-CD3 (20 μg/2 × 107 cells), or isotype control antibody (20 μg/2 × 107) cells were washed in kinase buffer and resuspended in 25 μl of kinase buffer. The kinase activity to CK2 standard substrate peptide was determined as described above. For determination of background radioactivity, cpm incorporation was determined in separate tubes that did not contain CK2 standard substrate peptide, and this value was subtracted. In some experiments, heparin (Sigma) was added to the kinase reaction at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic domain of CD5. We fused the entire 94 amino acid cytoplasmic domain of human CD5 to the GAL4 BD to generate BD-CD5 and used it as a bait to screen an AD-cDNA library made from human peripheral blood lymphocytes. From a screen of 6 × 106 co-transformants, we obtained 536 yeast colonies that grew on histidine-deficient plates, of which 510 were positive for LacZ expression by filter assay. We determined the nucleotide sequence of 10 randomly selected AD-cDNA isolated from His+LacZ+ yeast colonies, and a BLAST analysis showed that 6 of the 10 were identical to the β subunit of human CK2 (Fig. 1). In each of the six AD-CK2β clones, the in frame fusion with the GAL4-AD occurred in the 5′-untranslated (UT) region, and five of these six clearly represented independent clones because they had different lengths of 5′-UT amino acids. The interaction of AD-CK2β was specific to CD5 cytoplasmic domain as BD-lamin C or BD alone did not interact with CK2β (TableI). A polymerase chain reaction-based assay using primers that specifically amplify a 300-base pair fragment within the coding region of CK2β and performed directly on yeasts derived from growth-positive yeast colonies revealed that of the remaining 500 colonies, 245 (48%) were AD-CK2β.Table ISpecificity of interaction between AD-CK2β and BD-CD5AD-CK2β clone 11–11+Growth in platesLac Z expressionTrp−Leu−Trp−Leu−His−BD-CD5+++BD lamin CaHuman lamin C(66–230) in pGBT9-pLAM5′.+−−BDbGal4 BD vector pGBT9.+−−a Human lamin C(66–230) in pGBT9-pLAM5′.b Gal4 BD vector pGBT9. Open table in a new tab To determine whether CK2 associates with CD5 in mammalian cells, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. 1% Nonidet P-40 lysates from 2 × 107 murine B-lymphoma cell lines CH12 and NYC31, murine splenocytes, or the Jurkat human T cell line were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD5 or control mAb. Western blots of these immunoprecipitates probed anti-CK2α antibody showed that CK2α co-immunoprecipitated readily with CD5 specifically in each of these tissues (Fig. 2). As determined by comparison to whole cell lysates, the amount of CK2 associated with CD5 was less than 1% of total CK2, a very abundant cellular kinase (data not shown). We did not isolate any clone in the yeast two-hybrid screen that contained either of the two catalytic subunits of CK2, α, or α′. Due to the divergence of sequence homology in human and yeast CK2β, it seemed unlikely that human CK2β could complex with yeast CK2α to mediate the restoration of the GAL4 transcriptional activator. Therefore, the yeast two- hybrid screen suggested that CK2 may interact with CD5 via its regulatory β subunit. However, to directly test whether the interaction of CK2 with CD5 is mediated by its catalytic domains, we tested the ability of BD-CD5 to interact with AD-CK2α or AD-CK2α′ in the yeast two-hybrid assay along with the AD-CK2β clone 15-15 obtained from our library screen. We found that only co-transformants of BD-CD5 and AD-CK2β (clone 15-15) grew on histidine-deficient plates and expressed LacZ. AD-CK2α and AD-CK2α′ did not interact with BD-CD5 (Table II). The lack of interaction between BD-CD5 and either AD-CK2α or AD-CK2α′ is unlikely to be a construct artifact, because these constructs have been shown previously to be functional and have the capability to interact with CK2β (41Gietz R.D. Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biochem. 1995; 270: 13017-13021Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 42Litchfield D.W. Slominski E. Lewenza S. Narvey M. Bosc D.G. Gietz R.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we conclude that the interaction of CK2 to CD5 is mediated by the β subunit.Table IICK2 association with CD5 is mediated by CK2β subunitConstructGrowth in platesLac Z expressionTrp−Leu−Trp−Leu−His−AD-CK2βaAD clone 15–15.+++AD-CK2α+−−AD-CK2α′+−−a AD clone 15–15. Open table in a new tab The observation that each of the six completely sequenced AD-CK2β clones isolated from library were in frame fusions at the 5′-UT region suggested to us that CK2β might be interacting with CD5 via its amino terminus. To test this possibility directly, we compared the ability of the full-length AD-CK2β clone 15-15, which has an in frame fusion in the 5′-UT region, the full-length clone AD-CK2β2–215, which lacks a “linker” region, and deletion constructs of AD-CK2β constructs to interact with BD-CD5 (Fig. 3). Yeast containing BD-CD5 and AD clone 15-15, AD-CK2β2–215, or AD-CK2β2–132, but not AD-CK2β133–215, grew in the absence of histidine and expressed LacZ (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the growth on histidine-deficient plates of yeast containing BD-CD5 and AD clone 15-15 was most rapid. In the LacZ assay, this co-transformant also developed the most intense blue color in the shortest time (30 min versus 3 h) compared with co-transformants containing AD-CK2β2–215 and AD-CK2β2–132. This observation suggests that the “linker” contributed by the 5′-UT region facilitated the interaction between AD-CK2β fusion and BD-CD5, most probably by making the amino terminus more accessible. From these results, we conclude that the amino terminus of CK2β mediates the interaction with CD5 cytoplasmic tail. The cytoplasmic tail of CD5 has four putative serine phosphorylation sites, Ser415, Ser423, Ser459, and Ser461, all of which have the consensus motif ((S/T)XX(D/E)) for phosphorylation by CK2 (47Meggio F. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 401-419PubMed Google Scholar, 48Songynag Z. Lu K.P. Kwon Y.T. Tsai L.-H. Filhol O. Cochet C. Brickey D.A. Soderling T.R. Bartleson C. Graves D.J. DeMaggio A.J. Hoekstra M.F. Blenis J. Hunter T. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6486-6493Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). To determine which of these motifs are involved in interaction with CK2β, we generated a panel of BD-CD5 deletion constructs in which we had deleted one or more of these motifs and tested for their ability to interact with AD-CK2β in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 4 A). We found that deletion of the motif at Ser415 and Ser423 independently or together did not affect the ability of CK2β to interact with CD5. In contrast, the interaction of CK2β with CD5 was completely absent in the three constructs that included Ser459 and Ser461 and the non-CK2 site Ser458. These data show that the interaction of CK2β with CD5 is limited to the two overlapping CK2 motifs that include Ser459 and Ser461(458SSDSDYD464). To determine whether Ser459 and Ser461 were required for interaction with CK2β, we constructed BD-CD5 constructs containing S459G and S461G single and double substitutions and tested these constructs for their ability to interact with AD-CK2β (Fig. 4 B). The analysis showed a quantitatively decreased yet persistent interaction with AD-CK2β compared with “wild type” BD-CD5, indicating that the presence of serine was not an absolute necessity for CK2β binding to CD5 and that residues flanking the CK2 motif can by themselves contribute to binding to CK2β. To determine whether CK2 can phosphorylate CD5, we performed an in vitro kinase assay with purified CK2 using a 16-amino acid synthetic CD5-peptide (456DNSSDSDYDLHGAQRL471) that included Ser459 and Ser461 CK2 motifs and compared its ability to be phosphorylated with CK2 standard substrate peptide (RRREEETEEE) (45Kuenzel E.A. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). After normalizing for equivalent moles of peptide, we determined that the 32P incorporation in CD5-peptide was approximately 1.5-fold greater than CK2 control peptide (Fig. 5 A). Because there is only one available phosphorylation site in the CK2 standard peptide, the greater phosphorylation may indicate that both the CK2 sites in CD5-peptide are phosphorylated. To confirm that Ser459 and Ser461 are phosphorylated by CK2 and to determine whether other serine or threonine sites are phosphorylated following CK2 binding to CD5, we constructed ThioHisCD5 WT cytoplasmic tail fusion protein and S459A and S461A single and double mutant fusion proteins. In an in vitro kinase assay with purified CK2 and these fusion proteins as substrates, we observed essentially no phosphorylation of S459A,S461A double mutant and markedly reduced phosphorylation of both the S459A and the S461A single mutant fusion proteins, compared with wild type fusion protein (Fig. 5 B). Adjusted for protein concentration by densitometric analysis, PhosphorImager analysis showed that the phosphorylation of S459A mutant fusion protein was 2-fold lower than that of S461A fusion protein. Overall these results indicate that both S459A and S461A are sites of CK2 phosphorylation, with Ser459 being preferred. Notably, in the in vitrokinase assay under conditions of high concentrations of substrate and purified kinase, neither Ser415 nor Ser423 was phosphorylated. We tested the possibility that CD5 may function as a regulator of CK2 activity because CK2 interacts with CD5 constitutively via its regulatory subunit in the absence of demonstrable phosphorylation. Using CK2 standard peptide as substrate, we determined the CK2 activity in CD5 immunoprecipitates from the B lymphoma line, CH12, following stimulation with anti-CD5 mAb or control antibody. We found that CD5-associated CK2 activity increased 9-fold following stimulation with anti-CD5 antibody compared with CK2 activity from control antibody-treated cells (Fig. 6 A). The activation of CD5-associated CK2 was not due to net recruitment of CK2 to CD5 because the amount of CK2 protein co-immunopre"

Consistent with the latter, a severalfold increase in the amount of the α1C subunit in the plasma membrane was detected by quantitative confocal laser-scanning microscopy after β3subunit injection. Pretreatment of oocytes with bafilomycin A1, a vacuolar type H+-ATPase inhibitor, abolished the increase of the α1C subunit in the plasma membrane, attenuated current increase, but did not affect the modulation of current kinetics and voltage dependence by the β3 subunit. These results provide clear evidence that the β subunit modifies the calcium channel complex in a binary fashion; one is an allosteric modulation of the α1 subunit function and the other is a chaperoning of the α1 subunit to the plasma membrane.

These results provide clear evidence that the β subunit modifies the calcium channel complex in a binary fashion; one is an allosteric modulation of the α1 subunit function and the other is a chaperoning of the α1 subunit to the plasma membrane. Voltage-gated calcium channels are heteromultimeric protein complexes that consist of at least three (α1, α2/δ, and β) subunits and play a central role in diverse biological functions such as excitation-contraction coupling, excitation-secretion coupling, neurotransmitter release, and regulation of gene expression. The α1 subunit accommodates the channel pore, voltage sensor, and binding sites for various channel-modifying compounds. It has also been shown that the basic characteristics of the different channel types (L-, N-, P-, Q-, and R-type) are carried by the corresponding α1 subunits (1Varadi G. Mori Y. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Auxiliary subunits (α2/δ, β, and γ) modulate calcium channel characteristics, such as current amplitude, voltage dependence, and kinetics of activation and inactivation as well as sensitivity to calcium channel antagonists (2Singer D.

The modulatory effects of the β subunit on the Ca2+channel complex have been extensively studied using coexpression of cDNAs in heterologous systems. It is well established that coexpression of the α1 subunit with a β subunit results in an increase of peak current density (5Mori Y. Friedrich T. Kim M.-S. Mikami A. Nakai J. Ruth P. Bosse E.

However, there have been inconsistencies in the reported mechanism(s) by which these effects occur. Varadi et al. (6Varadi G. Lory P. Schultz D. Varadi M. Schwartz A. Nature. 1991; 352: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) reported a 10-fold increase in the number of DHP-binding sites by coexpression of the α1 subunit with the β subunit, suggesting an increase in available channels within the plasma membrane. In contrast, an increase in current amplitude without affecting charge movement by β subunit coexpression was shown by Neely et al. (8Neely A. Wei X. Olcese R. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Science. 1993; 262: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These same authors later reported two modes of activation of the α1C subunit (13Neely A. Olcese P. Baldelli P. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Stefani E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C732-C740Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Coexpression of a β subunit potentiated current by an increase of the fast-activating component, an acceleration of the slow component, and a larger proportion of long openings. An increase in DHP binding and current density without a change in the amount of α1subunit protein in the plasma membrane was reported by Nishimuraet al. (10Nishimura S. Takeshima H. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 324: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that the β subunit modulates channel properties by “assisting” the α1subunit in establishing a proper conformation suitable for a functional Ca2+ channel, rather than affecting expression, trafficking, or stability of the α1 subunit (reviewed by Catterall (14Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar)). By using immunocytochemical methods, Chien et al. (15Chien A.J. Zhao X. Shirokov R.E. Puri T.S. Chang C.F. Sun D. Rios E. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30036-30044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) showed that the β2a subunit acts as a chaperone-like molecule to facilitate membrane targeting of the α1Csubunit, without affecting the total amount of expressed α1C subunit in human embryonic kidney cells. Coexpression of the α1C subunit with β2a resulted in a marked increase in localization of the α1C subunit to the plasma membrane. These observations were confirmed by Brice et al. (16Brice N.L. Berrow N.S. Campbell V. Page K.M. Brickley K. Tedder I. Dolphin A.C. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) who coexpressed the α1A with α2/δ and several different β subunits. By usingXenopus oocytes as an expression system, Shistik et al. (17Shistik E. Ivanina T. Puri T. Hosey M. Dascal N. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1995; 489: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) reported opposite results in that no change in the amount of α1 subunit protein was found in the plasma membrane when coexpressed with a β subunit. Interestingly, an increase in charge movement has been reported when α1C and β subunits were coexpressed in a mammalian cell system (18Josephson I.R. Varadi G. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1285-1293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Kamp T.J. Perez-Garcia M.T. Marban E. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 492: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These discrepancies have been attributed to differences in expression systems employed (20Hosey M.M. Chien A.J. Puri T.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1996; 6: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, the mechanisms by which the β subunit modulates calcium channel activity remain unclear. The limitation of previous studies are that they were all done using coexpression of the α1 and β subunits, which makes it difficult to answer the question as to which level of the biosynthesis of the channel complex is the β subunit working, i.e. translation, trafficking, and/or direct binding to the membrane-incorporated α1 subunit. We address these questions by injecting a recombinant β subunit protein into Xenopus oocytes expressing the α1C subunit and observing the time course of modulation. We found that changes in voltage dependence of activation and kinetics occurred at an earlier stage in the time course, compared with increases in current amplitude which required a substantially longer time to reach plateau. This suggests that the effects are functionally uncoupled and occur by distinct mechanisms. By using confocal laser-scanning microscopy (CLSM), we found that the amount of the α1 subunit in the plasma membrane was substantially increased by the β subunit. Furthermore, pretreatment of oocytes with bafilomycin A1, a vacuolar type H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) inhibitor (21Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar), inhibited the β subunit effect on current amplitude, abolished the increase in channel amount in the plasma membrane, but did not influence the β effects on voltage dependence and current kinetics. The human calcium channel β3cDNA clone (22Klöckner U. Mikala G. Varadi M. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17306-17310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) between theHindIII and BamHI sites. This plasmid was cleaved with HindIII, and the protruding end was filled in with T4 DNA polymerase and then cut with BamHI to liberate the β3-coding fragment. The pET15(b) vector (Novagen) was cleaved with NdeI, filled in with T4 DNA polymerase, and then cut with BamHI. Finally, the β3 fragment was ligated into the blunt end/BamHI sites. This strategy has generated an in-frame cloning of the β3 protein with the His6-tag sequence and resulted in a fusion product that had the following peptide fused to the N-terminal sequence of the human β3 protein, MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHKLDP. The sequence of the construct was verified by sequencing through the junction regions. Escherichia coli BL21(λDE3) (Novagen) cells were transformed with the above construct and used for mass production of the His6-tagged β3 fusion protein. The cells were cultured in 500 ml of LB medium in the presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown at 37 °C until an A 600of 0.8 was reached. The production of fusion protein was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for various times at temperatures between 23 and 37 °C (we found induction being optimal at 23 °C for 8 h). The cells were pelleted by low speed centrifugation, washed with buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0), resuspended in 10 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.9), and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was further fractionated by differential centrifugation. The resulting pellet (1,000 × g, P12) contained nondisrupted cells and inclusion bodies. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 10,000 × g, resulting in a pellet (P3) and a clear supernatant fraction (S), which was purified on a His-bound column (Ni2+-agarose, Novagen). The column was washed with 60 mm imidazole, pH 7.9, and finally the specifically bound protein was eluted with 1 m imidazole and 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.9. We observed that the eluted protein product aggregated when stored frozen in the elution buffer. To prevent aggregation we dialyzed the eluate gradually against 100 mmEDTA·Tris, pH 7.6, and stored at −80 °C in small aliquots. The protein fractions and purification products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentrations were determined with the Pierce protein assay kit. The I–II, II–III, and III–IV intracellular loops were extracted from the human heart calcium channel cDNA (23Schultz D. Mikala G. Yatani A. Engle D.B. Iles D.E. Segers B. Sinke R.J. Weghuis D.O.

By using PCR we performed site-directed mutagenesis, placing unique BamHI and XhoI restriction sites at both the 5′ and 3′ ends of these fragments. The PCR products containing the I–II loop (nucleotides 1089–1499), the II–III loop (nucleotides 2133–2633), and the III–IV loop (nucleotides 3402–3574) were subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which is under the control of thetac promoter and contains the glutathioneS-transferase (GST) tag. The resulting subclones, pGEXI–II, pGEXII–II, and pGEXIII–IV, were sequenced, and analysis confirmed the presence of the intracellular loops and the absence of additional mutations. The pGEX-4T-1, pGEXI–II, pGEXII–III, and pGEXIII–IV plasmids were transformed into Novablue (DE3) cells (Novagen). Production and purification of GST fusion proteins were done according to the manufacturer's protocol. The pET15(b) plasmid carrying the hβ3 subunit cDNA was used to synthesize hβ3 using the coupled in vitro transcription/translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was used to minimize proteolysis. Screening of fusion proteins with the radioactively labeled hβ3 subunit was performed three times, as described previously (24De Waard M. Witcher D.R. Pragnell M. Liu H. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

A 1:10 dilution was made in fresh media and grown at 37 °C for ∼2–4 h, until anA 600 of 1.0 was reached. The bacterial cultures were then induced with 1 mm IPTG for 4 h at 23 °C. Cultures were sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in ice-cold 1× PBS, 1% Triton X-100 buffer and disrupted by sonication for ∼20 s. After sedimentation of the lysate by centrifugation at 4 °C, the soluble fractions containing the GST fusion proteins were adsorbed to glutathione-bound Sepharose (1 volume lysate, 0.1 volume of 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The slurry was centrifuged at 4 °C and washed 3 times with 1× PBS, 1% Triton X-100 and resuspended in an equal volume of ice-cold 1× PBS, 1% Triton X-100, and 35S-labeled hβ3 subunit was addedin vitro. This mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The slurry was centrifuged and washed 4 times with 1× PBS, 1% Triton X-100 and eluted with 10 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After elution, the slurry was spun for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed and added to an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer. One-half of the eluate was run on a 5–14% gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Blue for protein detection, and the remainder of the eluate was run on another 5–14% gradient SDS-PAGE gel. This gel was fixed, treated with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for fluorography for 30 min, dried, and exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Xenopus laevis oocytes (stage V–VI) were prepared as described previously (26Tang S. Yatani A. Bahinski A. Mori Y. Schwartz A.

After 4–5 days of incubation at 19 °C in the solution containing (in mm) 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2, 5 HEPES, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, 0.5 theophylline, pH 7.5, supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of either β3 subunit fusion protein solution (90 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 10 mm EDTA, 340 ng/μl protein, pH 7.4, with Tris) or vehicle (same composition except protein). The final concentrations in the oocytes were 300 nm β3 subunit fusion protein, 4.5 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, 0.5 mm EDTA, assuming the volume of oocytes was 1 μl. We found this was a saturating amount of protein since in our preliminary experiments higher concentrations did not result in greater effects. In the experiments indicated, oocytes were preincubated in a solution containing 500 nm bafilomycin A1 for 2–3 h prior to the injection of the protein. After injection, they were further incubated in the presence of bafilomycin A1until currents were measured. Bafilomycin A1 was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as a 1 mm stock solution. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was 0.05%, which had no effect on the currents or the β effect. The currents were recorded 1–4 h after injection with the β protein or vehicle using the standard two-electrode voltage-clamp technique at room temperature (20–21 °C). One oocyte was used for only one recording. The recording medium contained (in mm): 40 Ba(OH)2, 50 N-methyl-d-glucamine, 2 KOH, 5 HEPES, 0.5 niflumic acid, pH 7.4, with methanesulfonic acid. The voltage recording electrode and the current injection electrode were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–1mΩ. Currents were recorded using an Axoclamp-2A (Axon Instruments) amplifier. Pulses were applied from a holding potential of −80 mV every 15 s. Whole cell leakage and capacitative currents were digitally subtracted using the P/4 protocol. Data were filtered at 1 kHz, sampled at 1–10 kHz, and stored on a hard disk. Batches of oocytes that showed significant (>20 nA) endogenous Ca2+channel current were excluded from the analysis. The unpairedt test and analysis of variance were performed for the statistical analyses. DNA sequence complementary to the YPYDVPDYA epitope sequence of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) (27Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), which is recognized by the 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody, was introduced to the N terminus immediately after the initiator methionine of human heart L-type calcium channel α1C subunit DNA by PCR-based mutagenesis. The cRNA of the epitope-tagged α1subunit was transcribed and injected into X. laevis oocytes to express tagged channels. The functional characteristics of HA epitope-tagged α1 were tested in a separate set of experiments, and we found that the expressed currents and modulation of them by the β3 subunit were indistinguishable from those of wild type (data not shown). After 4–5 days of incubation, oocytes were injected with the β3 subunit fusion protein as described above. Four hours after injection, oocytes were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.25% glutaraldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature. Oocytes were then post-fixed in 100% methanol at −20 °C overnight, incubated with 2% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 10 μg/ml fluorescein-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) at 4 °C overnight. Oocytes were then washed extensively in PBS and examined by CLSM. The human β3 subunit fusion protein was purified from the soluble fraction of a bacterial culture induced with IPTG at 23 °C for 8 h. The soluble fraction was then applied to a Ni2+-agarose column. Approximately 88.5% of total protein was in the flow-through. A smaller amount of total protein (∼8%) weakly bound to the resin and was washed out by 60 mm imidazole. Approximately 3.5% of the total protein bound firmly to the Ni2+-agarose and was eluted with 1m imidazole and 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of the P12 fraction showed large quantities of the 57-kDa β3 protein, which was insoluble and not suitable for purification. The P3 and S fractions contained sizable amounts of the β3 protein. Ni2+-agarose affinity purification of the S fraction resulted in highly pure β3 protein (estimated purity is higher than 99.5%) with the predicted molecular weight (Fig. 1 B, lane 7). To determine whether the recombinant His6-tagged β3 subunit was able to interact with the calcium channel intracellular I–II loop, as identified by Pragnell et al. (28Pragnell M. De Waard M. Mori Y. Tanabe T. Snutch T.P. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1994; 368: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), we created GST fusion proteins of the I–II, II–III, and III–IV loops of the α1C subunit and screened with an in vitro transcribed and translated,35S-labeled His6-tagged β3subunit. The data from these experiments clearly show that the His6-tagged β3 subunit is able to interact with the I–II loop in a highly specific manner (Fig. 2 A). In addition, these results indicate that the β3 subunit did not interact with the control GST, II–III, and the III–IV loops. A sample of the eluate was run on an 4–15% SDS-PAGE gel and stained with Coomassie Blue to determine whether the purified fusion protein could also be eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose. All four GST fusion proteins were purified and present in the binding assay eliminating the possibility of nonspecific interaction with other protein components (Fig. 2 B). These experiments confirm that the His6-tagged β3 subunit maintains its ability to interact with the I–II loop of the α1C subunitin vitro. Oocytes were injected with human α1C subunit cRNA and incubated for 4–5 days. The control (α1C subunit alone) Ca2+ channels expressed in oocytes showed peak barium currents of 149 ± 14 nA (n = 14) when depolarized from a holding potential of −80 mV to test potentials between −30 and +60 mV. The control current exhibited a slow activation and very little inactivation (Fig. 3 A), in agreement with previous studies (2Singer D. Biel M. Lotan I. Flockerzi V. Hofmann F. Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 9Lory P. Varadi G. Slish D.F. Varadi M. Schwartz A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The threshold potential for current activation was found between −20 and −10 mV, and the current peaked at +40 mV. After injection of the β3 subunit fusion protein, an increase in current amplitude, a change in the voltage dependence of activation, and changes in activation and inactivation kinetics occurred in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A). After injection of the β3 subunit fusion protein the activation threshold shifted to hyperpolarizing potentials between −30 and −20 mV, and the current peaked between +20 and +30 mV. The current-voltage (I–V) relationships corresponding to the current traces depicted in Fig. 3 A are superimposed in Fig. 3 B. Most notably, the shift of the I–V curve occurs within 2 h, whereas the increase in current amplitude requires a longer time scale. Fig. 4 depicts the average time course of peak Ba2+ current amplitude enhancement after injection of the β3 subunit fusion protein. We observed an increase in peak current amplitude, 2.3-fold at 1 h and 2.9-fold at 2 h after injection of the β3 subunit. However, more than half of the increase occurred after 2 h, reaching a plateau at 3 h (6.5- and 6.6-fold for 3 and 4 h after injection, respectively). The effect of the β subunit on the current amplitude is clearly slower than the effect on the voltage dependence of activation (cf. Fig. 5). The time of the half-maximal effect for the increase in current amplitude was between 2 and 3 h. Injection of the vehicle had no significant effect on peak current amplitude, although after 4 h the current amplitude appeared to be smaller in some cases. We attribute this to a nonspecific mechanistic disruption by the injection itself.Figure 5Time-dependent effect of β3 subunit fusion protein on the voltage dependence of activation. A, steady-state activation curves for control (α1C subunit alone) and after the injection of β3 subunit fusion protein. Fractions of activated channels were calculated by fitting individual experiments to the following equation: I =G max(V m −V rev)/(1 + exp(V 0.5 −V m)/k), where G maxis the maximum conductance; V m is the test potential; V rev is the current reversal potential; V 0.5 is the half-activation potential; and k is the slope factor. The curves show Boltzmann distributions that best fit the averaged data. Average and S.E. from 5 to 8 experiments for each group are shown. B, time courses of the β subunit effect on the half-activation potential. Average values from 4 to 14 experiments are shown.Error bars show S.E. Baf, bafilomycin A1-treated group. Half-activation potential was calculated by the above equation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been established that the V-ATPase is responsible for the maintenance of the luminal acidic environment within cell organelles including the Golgi complex, lysosomes, and endosomes (29Forgac M. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the V-ATPase by bafilomycin A1 impairs the intracellular transportation of glycoproteins via alkalinization of the organelles (30Umata T. Moriyama Y. Futai M. Mekeda E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21940-21945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if the β subunit assists the translocation of the α1 subunit to the plasma membrane, inhibition of this pathway may be imposed by consequences on one or all of the auxiliary β subunit modulatory function(s). Therefore, we pretreated oocytes with bafilomycin A1 to determine whether the β subunit participates in the intracellular translocation of the α1C subunit. Pretreatment of oocytes expressing the α1C subunit with bafilomycin A1 for 2–3 h showed a slight decrease in the control (α1C subunit alone) current (114 ± 14 nA, n = 7) compared with the untreated control. However, these data were not statistically different (p = 0.13 versusuntreated control). The effect of the β3 subunit protein on peak current amplitude was effectively blocked by preincubation with bafilomycin A1 prior to subunit injection. Only 1.5-, 1.8-, 1.8-, and 1.7-fold current increase was observed at 1–4 h after injection of the β3 subunit protein, respectively. Steady-state activation curves were derived from I–V relationships, and the β3 subunit effect on the voltage dependence of activation was further analyzed (Fig. 5 A). Control currents showed a shallow activation curve with a half-activation potential of 29.9 ± 1.5 mV (n = 14). Injection of the β3 subunit protein caused a leftward shift of the curve and an increase in the slope. Most dramatic changes occurred within 1 h, and no significant changes were observed between 2, 3, and 4 h after injection. As shown in Fig. 5 B, ∼70% of the negative shift in the half-activation potential occurred within 1 h after injection, reaching a plateau at 2 h. The time of the half-maximal effect was less than 1 h. The vehicle had no effect on the voltage dependence of activation. Bafilomycin A1 treatment did not influence the ability of the β3 subunit to shift the half-activation potential in the negative direction (Fig. 5 B). We measured the time to half-peak current as a parameter of the macroscopic activation kinetics. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the control (α1 subunit alone) current showed slow activation. When depolarized to +30 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV, the time to half-peak was 19.2 ± 1.0 ms (n =9) (Fig. 6 A). The injection of oocytes with the β subunit protein rapidly facilitated activation kinetics, reaching a plateau within 2 h, with the time of the half-maximal effect occurring within 1 h. The vehicle did not change activation kinetics. Pretreatment of oocytes with bafilomycin A1 did not change activation kinetics of control (α1 subunit alone) currents and did no"
https://openalex.org/W2027254518,"A possible regulatory mechanism of protein kinase C (PKC) in the chondrogenesis of chick limb bud mesenchymes has been investigated. Inhibition or down-regulation of PKC resulted in the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase subtype Erk-1 and the inhibition of chondrogenesis. On the other hand, inhibition of Erk-1 with PD98059 enhanced chondrogenesis and relieved PKC-induced blockage of chondrogenesis. Erk-1 inhibition, however, did not affect expression and subcellular distribution of PKC isoforms expressed in mesenchymes nor cell proliferation. The results suggest that PKC regulates chondrogenesis by modulating Erk-1 activity. Inhibition or depletion of PKC inhibited proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells, and Erk-1 inhibition did not affect PKC modulation of cell proliferation. However, PKC-induced modulation of expression of cell adhesion molecules involved in precartilage condensation was reversed by the inhibition of Erk-1. Expression of N-cadherin was detected at the early period of chondrogenesis. Inhibition or depletion of PKC induced sustained expression of N-cadherin, and Erk-1 inhibition blocked the effects of PKC modulation. The expression of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin was found to be increased transiently during chondrogenesis. Depletion or inhibition of PKC caused a continuous increase of the expression of these molecules throughout the culture period, and Erk-1 inhibition abolished the modulating effects of PKC. Because reduction of the examined cell adhesion molecule expression is a prerequisite for the progression of chondrogenesis after cell condensation, our results indicate that PKC regulates chondrogenesis by modulating expression of these molecules via Erk-1 signaling.

Prechondrogenic mesenchymes differentiate to chondrocytes when they become closely packed in the limb buds of chick embryo or duringin vitro micromass culture of mesenchymes (1Solursh M. Curr. Opin.

Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9958) Google Scholar). Chondrogenesis in vitro requires transient proliferation of cells to increase the number of chondrogenic competent cells, and the increased number of cells undergoes extensive cell-cell interaction such as precartilage condensation, which is one of the earliest morphogenetic events (1Solursh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Reddi H.A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 3Hamburger V.

Thereafter, a large amount of cartilage-specific ECM components such as sulfated proteoglycans and type II collagen are synthesized until individual chondrocytes are surrounded by the ECM (1Solursh M.

Several groups of extracellular molecules have been found to regulate chondrogenesis during the stages of cell proliferation and precartilage condensation. For example, a fibroblast growth factor appears to enhance chondrogenesis by increasing the number of chondrogenic competent cells (11Savage M.P. Hart C.E. Riley B.B. Sasse J. Olwin B.B. Falion J.F. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 198: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whereas transforming growth factor β family members enhance chondrogenic differentiation by promoting precartilage condensation (12Duprez D.M. Coltey M. Amthor H. Brikell P.M. Tickle C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Roark E.F. Geer K. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 200: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).Although much progress has been made in finding a mechanism governing chondrogenesis at levels of cell proliferation and precartilage condensation, the signal transduction pathways involved in chondrogenesis are poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that protein kinase C (PKC) might play a key role in chondrogenic differentiation (14Sonn J.-K. Solursh M.

Cell Differ. 1983; 13: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), as shown by the fact that PKC activities in both cytosol and particulate membrane fractions of mesenchymes increased during chondrogenesis (14Sonn J.-K. Solursh M. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The activities of PKC seem to be required for chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymes because inhibition or down-regulation of PKC blocks chondrogenesis (15Choi B. Chun J.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Kang S-.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and also causes dedifferentiation of rabbit costal and articular chondrocytes (16Bouakka M.

Cell Differ. 1983; 13: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PKC is a multigene family composed of 11 known isoforms (18Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar, 20Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Chick limb bud mesenchymes express α, ε, ζ, and λ/ι isoforms, and depletion of PKCα and ε is sufficient to inhibit chondrogenesis (15Choi B. Chun J.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Kang S-.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKCα and/or ε induces chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymes.Although the requirement of PKC in chondrogenesis has been clearly established, its molecular mechanism in the regulation of chondrogenesis is not evident. To elucidate a possible mechanism involved in PKC action, our effort in this study has been focused on whether the regulatory role of PKC in chondrogenesis is mediated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and also on whether PKC and/or MAP kinase regulates chondrogenesis at stages of proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells and precartilage condensation.DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence support the hypothesis that chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymes is regulated by PKC (14Sonn J.-K. Solursh M. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Choi B. Chun J.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Kang S-.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

PKC was initially thought to regulate chondrogenesis in a negative way because staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC, enhanced chondrogenesis (30Kulyk W.M. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it was found later that the stimulatory effect of staurosporine was caused by effects other than its ability to inhibit PKC (31Kulyk W.M. Hoffman L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PKC has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including growth and differentiation of many types of cells (18Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of cellular processes by PKC has been suggested to be mediated by direct regulation of gene expression and/or regulation of activities of other signaling molecules such as MAP kinase (18Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar, 20Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). It is well known that direct stimulation of PKC with phorbol ester leads to an activation of MAP kinase (32Chao T.-S.O.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar).Studies on PKC regulation of MAP kinase indicated that stimulation of PKC activated MAP kinase signaling (32Chao T.-S.O. Foster D.A. Rapp U.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osda S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, in the present study we found that the inhibition or down-regulation of PKC resulted in the activation of Erk-1 and that the activated Erk-1 was responsible for the inhibitory role of PKC in chondrogenesis. This conclusion was derived from the observations that phosphorylation of Erk-1 was related to the inhibition of chondrogenesis (Fig. 2) and that the inhibition of Erk-1 phosphorylation relieved the inhibition of chondrogenesis induced by PKC (Fig. 4). The signaling pathway leading to the activation of Erk-1 by the inhibition or down-regulation of PKC is not currently known. Because stimulation of PKC is known to activate Erk-1 and -2 by the stimulation of upstream signaling molecules such as Raf (32Chao T.-S.O. Foster D.A. Rapp U.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osda S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), it is not likely that activation of Erk-1 is induced by the stimulation of Raf as a consequence of PKC inhibition or depletion. Rather, it is quite possible that inhibition or depletion of PKC inactivates MAP kinase phosphatase, which enhances MAP kinase activation (24Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 25Seger R. Krebs E.G.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar).Subtypes of MAP kinase, Erk-1 and -2, are thought to play a key role in the signaling process of many types of cellular differentiation, acting as an inhibitor or stimulator for cellular differentiation, depending on the types of differentiation. For instance, activation of both Erk-1 and -2 is required for the differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes (34Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and maturation of immature T cells also requires MAP kinase activity because expression of catalytically inactive MAP kinase kinase inhibits T cell maturation (35Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perimutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above, it has been suggested that inactivation of Erk-2 is required for C2C12 myoblasts to initiate myogenesis (36Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Inactivation of MAP kinase is also observed during enterocyte differentiation (37Mamajiwalla S.N. Burgess D.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated in this study that inactivation of Erk-1 is required for the initiation of chondrogenesis.Extracellular molecules known to regulate chondrogenesis exert their effects at the level of cell proliferation and/or precartilage condensation (11Savage M.P. Hart C.E. Riley B.B. Sasse J. Olwin B.B. Falion J.F. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 198: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Duprez D.M. Coltey M. Amthor H. Brikell P.M. Tickle C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Roark E.F. Geer K. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 200: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of PKC and Erk-1 in the regulation of proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells and the expression of cell adhesion molecules known to be involved in precartilage condensation. Because inhibition or down-regulation of PKC reduces cell proliferation (Fig. 6), PKC activity appeared to be required for the proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells. However, the inhibition of cell proliferation by PKC was eliminated not by inhibiting Erk-1 (Fig. 6), whereas chondrogenesis was recovered significantly (Fig. 4). In addition, the inhibition of Erk-1 in the absence of PKC modulation, a condition that enhanced chondrogenesis, did not affect proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells, and PD98059 enhanced chondrogenesis at low cell density without affecting cell proliferation (Fig. 7). Therefore, we conclude that the stimulation and recovery of chondrogenesis by Erk-1 inhibition were not the result of enhancement of cell proliferation.Precartilage condensation is a process that reduces intercellular spaces and formation of extensive cell-cell contacts between prechondrogenic mesenchymes (1Solursh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Reddi H.A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 29Maini P.K. Solursh M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 129: 91-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The biochemical events leading to cell condensation are not yet understood clearly. However, both cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions have been considered to play a role in precartilage condensation. Therefore, the possibility of whether PKC and MAP kinase regulate chondrogenesis by modulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules and ECM components such as N-cadherin, integrin α5β1, and fibronectin was investigated.N-Cadherin has been known to be expressed in prechondrogenic mesenchymes and during cell condensation (4Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda R. Castagnola P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Tsonis P.A. Rio-Tsonis K.D. Millan J.L. Wheelock M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and blockage of its function inhibited precartilage condensation (6Oberlender S.O. Tuan R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 177-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was not expressed in chondrocytes that were completely surrounded by cartilage-specific ECM molecules (4Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda R. Castagnola P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 8) also indicated that N-cadherin was expressed at the early period of micromass culture, and its expression decreased as chondrogenesis proceeded. Inhibition or down-regulation of PKC resulted in sustained expression of N-cadherin, whereas inhibition of Erk-1 enhanced the decrease of N-cadherin expression at the later period of micromass culture. In addition, the effect of PKC on N-cadherin expression was blocked by the inhibition of Erk-1, suggesting that PKC action was mediated by Erk-1. A question of whether the modulation of N-cadherin expression by PKC and Erk-1 is a determinant of chondrogenesis or whether the modulation of chondrogenesis results in the altered expression of N-cadherin remains to be clarified. However, our data clearly indicate that PKC and Erk-1 signaling is closely coupled with the regulation of N-cadherin expression during chondrogenesis.In this study, we presented evidence that the expression of fibronectin and its receptor integrin α5β1 is regulated by PKC through Erk-1 signaling pathway, especially at the later stage of micromass culture,i.e. in cells cultured for 4–5 days (Fig. 8). Thus, the increased expression of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin at the later stage of micromass culture upon inhibition or depletion of PKC is closely correlated with the inhibition of chondrogenesis. On the other hand, the decreased expression of these molecules upon Erk-1 inhibition is correlated with an enhancement of chondrogenesis. The above results are consistent with the facts that an interaction of cells with fibronectin via integrin α5β1 is necessary for cell condensation to occur and that a reduction of fibronectin and its integrin α5β1 receptor after cell aggregation is necessary for the progression of cartilage differentiation (10Tavella S. Bellese G. Castagnola P. Martin I. Piccini D. Doliana R. Colombatti A. Cancedda R. Tacchetti C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2261-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Maini P.K. Solursh M. Int. Rev.

Indeed, it has been known that enhanced expression of fibronectin exerts negative effects on chondrogenesis (39Gerstenfeld L.C. Finer M.H. Boedtker H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Zanetti N.C. Solursh M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Gregg B.C. Rowe A. Brickell P.M. Wolpert L. Development. 1989; 105: 769-777PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated in this study that PKC activity that inactivates Erk-1 is required to reduce the expression of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin and thereby to initiate the progression of chondrogenic differentiation. Because the reduction of fibronectin and integrin α5β1 occurs after the cell aggregation (29Maini P.K. Solursh M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 129: 91-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), our results suggest also that PKC and Erk-1 are not directly related to cell condensation. It is not yet known how the reduction of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin expression causes progression of chondrogenesis and how Erk-1 regulates expression of cell adhesion molecules and ECM components during chondrogenesis. We postulate that Erk-1 modulates synthesis and/or activation of transcription factors that regulate the expression of cell adhesion molecules and ECM components. Further work is needed to define downstream events that lead to the modulation of cell adhesion molecule expression. Prechondrogenic mesenchymes differentiate to chondrocytes when they become closely packed in the limb buds of chick embryo or duringin vitro micromass culture of mesenchymes (1Solursh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Reddi H.A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 3Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9958) Google Scholar). Chondrogenesis in vitro requires transient proliferation of cells to increase the number of chondrogenic competent cells, and the increased number of cells undergoes extensive cell-cell interaction such as precartilage condensation, which is one of the earliest morphogenetic events (1Solursh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Reddi H.A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 3Hamburger V. Hamilton H.L. J. Morphol. 1951; 88: 49-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (9958) Google Scholar). Precartilage condensation is regulated by several cell adhesion molecules such as N-cadherin (4Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda R. Castagnola P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Tsonis P.A. Rio-Tsonis K.D. Millan J.L. Wheelock M.J. Exp.

Thereafter, a large amount of cartilage-specific ECM components such as sulfated proteoglycans and type II collagen are synthesized until individual chondrocytes are surrounded by the ECM (1Solursh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar,2Reddi H.A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Several groups of extracellular molecules have been found to regulate chondrogenesis during the stages of cell proliferation and precartilage condensation. For example, a fibroblast growth factor appears to enhance chondrogenesis by increasing the number of chondrogenic competent cells (11Savage M.P. Hart C.E. Riley B.B. Sasse J. Olwin B.B. Falion J.F. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 198: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whereas transforming growth factor β family members enhance chondrogenic differentiation by promoting precartilage condensation (12Duprez D.M. Coltey M. Amthor H. Brikell P.M. Tickle C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Roark E.F. Geer K. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 200: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Although much progress has been made in finding a mechanism governing chondrogenesis at levels of cell proliferation and precartilage condensation, the signal transduction pathways involved in chondrogenesis are poorly understood. Increasing evidence indicates that protein kinase C (PKC) might play a key role in chondrogenic differentiation (14Sonn J.-K. Solursh M. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Choi B. Chun J.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Kang S-.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cell Differ. 1983; 13: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), as shown by the fact that PKC activities in both cytosol and particulate membrane fractions of mesenchymes increased during chondrogenesis (14Sonn J.-K. Solursh M. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The activities of PKC seem to be required for chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymes because inhibition or down-regulation of PKC blocks chondrogenesis (15Choi B. Chun J.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Kang S-.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and also causes dedifferentiation of rabbit costal and articular chondrocytes (16Bouakka M. Legendre P. Jouis V. Langris M. Beliard R. Loyau G. Bocquet J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 153: 690-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Takigawa M. Fukuo K. Takano T. Suzuki F. Cell Differ. 1983; 13: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). PKC is a multigene family composed of 11 known isoforms (18Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar, 20Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Chick limb bud mesenchymes express α, ε, ζ, and λ/ι isoforms, and depletion of PKCα and ε is sufficient to inhibit chondrogenesis (15Choi B. Chun J.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Kang S-.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that PKCα and/or ε induces chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymes. Although the requirement of PKC in chondrogenesis has been clearly established, its molecular mechanism in the regulation of chondrogenesis is not evident. To elucidate a possible mechanism involved in PKC action, our effort in this study has been focused on whether the regulatory role of PKC in chondrogenesis is mediated by mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and also on whether PKC and/or MAP kinase regulates chondrogenesis at stages of proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells and precartilage condensation. DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence support the hypothesis that chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymes is regulated by PKC (14Sonn J.-K. Solursh M. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Choi B. Chun J.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Kang S-.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 1034-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Bouakka M. Legendre P. Jouis V. Langris M. Beliard R. Loyau G. Bocquet J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

PKC was initially thought to regulate chondrogenesis in a negative way because staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC, enhanced chondrogenesis (30Kulyk W.M. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it was found later that the stimulatory effect of staurosporine was caused by effects other than its ability to inhibit PKC (31Kulyk W.M. Hoffman L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PKC has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including growth and differentiation of many types of cells (18Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of cellular processes by PKC has been suggested to be mediated by direct regulation of gene expression and/or regulation of activities of other signaling molecules such as MAP kinase (18Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar, 20Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). It is well known that direct stimulation of PKC with phorbol ester leads to an activation of MAP kinase (32Chao T.-S.O. Foster D.A. Rapp U.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osda S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) which is a common intermediate in intracellular signaling cascades (24Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 25Seger R. Krebs E.G.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar).Studies on PKC regulation of MAP kinase indicated that stimulation of PKC activated MAP kinase signaling (32Chao T.-S.O. Foster D.A. Rapp U.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osda S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, in the present study we found that the inhibition or down-regulation of PKC resulted in the activation of Erk-1 and that the activated Erk-1 was responsible for the inhibitory role of PKC in chondrogenesis. This conclusion was derived from the observations that phosphorylation of Erk-1 was related to the inhibition of chondrogenesis (Fig. 2) and that the inhibition of Erk-1 phosphorylation relieved the inhibition of chondrogenesis induced by PKC (Fig. 4). The signaling pathway leading to the activation of Erk-1 by the inhibition or down-regulation of PKC is not currently known. Because stimulation of PKC is known to activate Erk-1 and -2 by the stimulation of upstream signaling molecules such as Raf (32Chao T.-S.O. Foster D.A. Rapp U.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osda S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), it is not likely that activation of Erk-1 is induced by the stimulation of Raf as a consequence of PKC inhibition or depletion. Rather, it is quite possible that inhibition or depletion of PKC inactivates MAP kinase phosphatase, which enhances MAP kinase activation (24Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 25Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 26Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar).Subtypes of MAP kinase, Erk-1 and -2, are thought to play a key role in the signaling process of many types of cellular differentiation, acting as an inhibitor or stimulator for cellular differentiation, depending on the types of differentiation. For instance, activation of both Erk-1 and -2 is required for the differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes (34Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and maturation of immature T cells also requires MAP kinase activity because expression of catalytically inactive MAP kinase kinase inhibits T cell maturation (35Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perimutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above, it has been suggested that inactivation of Erk-2 is required for C2C12 myoblasts to initiate myogenesis (36Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Inactivation of MAP kinase is also observed during enterocyte differentiation (37Mamajiwalla S.N. Burgess D.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated in this study that inactivation of Erk-1 is required for the initiation of chondrogenesis.Extracellular molecules known to regulate chondrogenesis exert their effects at the level of cell proliferation and/or precartilage condensation (11Savage M.P.

Therefore, we investigated the role of PKC and Erk-1 in the regulation of proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells and the expression of cell adhesion molecules known to be involved in precartilage condensation. Because inhibition or down-regulation of PKC reduces cell proliferation (Fig. 6), PKC activity appeared to be required for the proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells. However, the inhibition of cell proliferation by PKC was eliminated not by inhibiting Erk-1 (Fig. 6), whereas chondrogenesis was recovered significantly (Fig. 4). In addition, the inhibition of Erk-1 in the absence of PKC modulation, a condition that enhanced chondrogenesis, did not affect proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells, and PD98059 enhanced chondrogenesis at low cell density without affecting cell proliferation (Fig. 7). Therefore, we conclude that the stimulation and recovery of chondrogenesis by Erk-1 inhibition were not the result of enhancement of cell proliferation.Precartilage condensation is a process that reduces intercellular spaces and formation of extensive cell-cell contacts between prechondrogenic mesenchymes (1Solursh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Reddi H.A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 29Maini P.K. Solursh M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 129: 91-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The biochemical events leading to cell condensation are not yet understood clearly. However, both cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions have been considered to play a role in precartilage condensation. Therefore, the possibility of whether PKC and MAP kinase regulate chondrogenesis by modulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules and ECM components such as N-cadherin, integrin α5β1, and fibronectin was investigated.N-Cadherin has been known to be expressed in prechondrogenic mesenchymes and during cell condensation (4Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda R. Castagnola P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Tsonis P.A. Rio-Tsonis K.D. Millan J.L. Wheelock M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and blockage of its function inhibited precartilage condensation (6Oberlender S.O. Tuan R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 177-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was not expressed in chondrocytes that were completely surrounded by cartilage-specific ECM molecules (4Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda R. Castagnola P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 8) also indicated that N-cadherin was expressed at the early period of micromass culture, and its expression decreased as chondrogenesis proceeded. Inhibition or down-regulation of PKC resulted in sustained expression of N-cadherin, whereas inhibition of Erk-1 enhanced the decrease of N-cadherin expression at the later period of micromass culture. In addition, the effect of PKC on N-cadherin expression was blocked by the inhibition of Erk-1, suggesting that PKC action was mediated by Erk-1. A question of whether the modulation of N-cadherin expression by PKC and Erk-1 is a determinant of chondrogenesis or whether the modulation of chondrogenesis results in the altered expression of N-cadherin remains to be clarified. However, our data clearly indicate that PKC and Erk-1 signaling is closely coupled with the regulation of N-cadherin expression during chondrogenesis.In this study, we presented evidence that the expression of fibronectin and its receptor integrin α5β1 is regulated by PKC through Erk-1 signaling pathway, especially at the later stage of micromass culture,i.e. in cells cultured for 4–5 days (Fig. 8). Thus, the increased expression of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin at the later stage of micromass culture upon inhibition or depletion of PKC is closely correlated with the inhibition of chondrogenesis. On the other hand, the decreased expression of these molecules upon Erk-1 inhibition is correlated with an enhancement of chondrogenesis. The above results are consistent with the facts that an interaction of cells with fibronectin via integrin α5β1 is necessary for cell condensation to occur and that a reduction of fibronectin and its integrin α5β1 receptor after cell aggregation is necessary for the progression of cartilage differentiation (10Tavella S.

Indeed, it has been known that enhanced expression of fibronectin exerts negative effects on chondrogenesis (39Gerstenfeld L.C. Finer M.H. Boedtker H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1425-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40Zanetti N.C. Solursh M. Dev. Biol. 1986; 113: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 41Gregg B.C. Rowe A. Brickell P.M. Wolpert L. Development. 1989; 105: 769-777PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated in this study that PKC activity that inactivates Erk-1 is required to reduce the expression of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin and thereby to initiate the progression of chondrogenic differentiation. Because the reduction of fibronectin and integrin α5β1 occurs after the cell aggregation (29Maini P.K. Solursh M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 129: 91-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), our results suggest also that PKC and Erk-1 are not directly related to cell condensation. It is not yet known how the reduction of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin expression causes progression of chondrogenesis and how Erk-1 regulates expression of cell adhesion molecules and ECM components during chondrogenesis. We postulate that Erk-1 modulates synthesis and/or activation of transcription factors that regulate the expression of cell adhesion molecules and ECM components. Further work is needed to define downstream events that lead to the modulation of cell adhesion molecule expression. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymes is regulated by PKC (14Sonn J.-K. Solursh M. Differentiation. 1993; 53: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Choi B. Chun J.-S. Lee Y.-S. Sonn J.-K. Kang S-.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

PKC was initially thought to regulate chondrogenesis in a negative way because staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC, enhanced chondrogenesis (30Kulyk W.M. Dev. Biol. 1991; 146: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, it was found later that the stimulatory effect of staurosporine was caused by effects other than its ability to inhibit PKC (31Kulyk W.M. Hoffman L.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 290-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PKC has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes including growth and differentiation of many types of cells (18Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation of cellular processes by PKC has been suggested to be mediated by direct regulation of gene expression and/or regulation of activities of other signaling molecules such as MAP kinase (18Goodnight J. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 159-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar, 20Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). It is well known that direct stimulation of PKC with phorbol ester leads to an activation of MAP kinase (32Chao T.-S.O. Foster D.A. Rapp U.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osda S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) which is a common intermediate in intracellular signaling cascades (24Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 25Seger R. Krebs E.G.

Studies on PKC regulation of MAP kinase indicated that stimulation of PKC activated MAP kinase signaling (32Chao T.-S.O. Foster D.A. Rapp U.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osda S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, in the present study we found that the inhibition or down-regulation of PKC resulted in the activation of Erk-1 and that the activated Erk-1 was responsible for the inhibitory role of PKC in chondrogenesis. This conclusion was derived from the observations that phosphorylation of Erk-1 was related to the inhibition of chondrogenesis (Fig. 2) and that the inhibition of Erk-1 phosphorylation relieved the inhibition of chondrogenesis induced by PKC (Fig. 4). The signaling pathway leading to the activation of Erk-1 by the inhibition or down-regulation of PKC is not currently known. Because stimulation of PKC is known to activate Erk-1 and -2 by the stimulation of upstream signaling molecules such as Raf (32Chao T.-S.O. Foster D.A. Rapp U.R. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7337-7341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ueda Y. Hirai S. Osda S. Suzuki A. Mizuno K. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23512-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), it is not likely that activation of Erk-1 is induced by the stimulation of Raf as a consequence of PKC inhibition or depletion. Rather, it is quite possible that inhibition or depletion of PKC inactivates MAP kinase phosphatase, which enhances MAP kinase activation (24Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 25Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 26Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Subtypes of MAP kinase, Erk-1 and -2, are thought to play a key role in the signaling process of many types of cellular differentiation, acting as an inhibitor or stimulator for cellular differentiation, depending on the types of differentiation. For instance, activation of both Erk-1 and -2 is required for the differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes (34Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 674-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), and maturation of immature T cells also requires MAP kinase activity because expression of catalytically inactive MAP kinase kinase inhibits T cell maturation (35Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perimutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In contrast to the above, it has been suggested that inactivation of Erk-2 is required for C2C12 myoblasts to initiate myogenesis (36Bennett A.M. Tonks N.K. Science. 1997; 278: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Inactivation of MAP kinase is also observed during enterocyte differentiation (37Mamajiwalla S.N. Burgess D.R. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 377-386PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrated in this study that inactivation of Erk-1 is required for the initiation of chondrogenesis. Extracellular molecules known to regulate chondrogenesis exert their effects at the level of cell proliferation and/or precartilage condensation (11Savage M.P. Hart C.E. Riley B.B. Sasse J. Olwin B.B. Falion J.F. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 198: 159-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 12Duprez D.M. Coltey M. Amthor H. Brikell P.M. Tickle C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 174: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Roark E.F. Geer K. Dev. Dyn. 1994; 200: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the role of PKC and Erk-1 in the regulation of proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells and the expression of cell adhesion molecules known to be involved in precartilage condensation. Because inhibition or down-regulation of PKC reduces cell proliferation (Fig. 6), PKC activity appeared to be required for the proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells. However, the inhibition of cell proliferation by PKC was eliminated not by inhibiting Erk-1 (Fig. 6), whereas chondrogenesis was recovered significantly (Fig. 4). In addition, the inhibition of Erk-1 in the absence of PKC modulation, a condition that enhanced chondrogenesis, did not affect proliferation of chondrogenic competent cells, and PD98059 enhanced chondrogenesis at low cell density without affecting cell proliferation (Fig. 7). Therefore, we conclude that the stimulation and recovery of chondrogenesis by Erk-1 inhibition were not the result of enhancement of cell proliferation. Precartilage condensation is a process that reduces intercellular spaces and formation of extensive cell-cell contacts between prechondrogenic mesenchymes (1Solursh M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Reddi H.A. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1994; 4: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 29Maini P.K. Solursh M. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1991; 129: 91-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The biochemical events leading to cell condensation are not yet understood clearly. However, both cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions have been considered to play a role in precartilage condensation. Therefore, the possibility of whether PKC and MAP kinase regulate chondrogenesis by modulating the expression of cell adhesion molecules and ECM components such as N-cadherin, integrin α5β1, and fibronectin was investigated. N-Cadherin has been known to be expressed in prechondrogenic mesenchymes and during cell condensation (4Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda R. Castagnola P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 5Tsonis P.A. Rio-Tsonis K.D. Millan J.L. Wheelock M.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and blockage of its function inhibited precartilage condensation (6Oberlender S.O. Tuan R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 177-187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was not expressed in chondrocytes that were completely surrounded by cartilage-specific ECM molecules (4Tavella S. Raffo P. Tacchetti C. Cancedda R. Castagnola P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 215: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Our results (Fig. 8) also indicated that N-cadherin was expressed at the early period of micromass culture, and its expression decreased as chondrogenesis proceeded. Inhibition or down-regulation of PKC resulted in sustained expression of N-cadherin, whereas inhibition of Erk-1 enhanced the decrease of N-cadherin expression at the later period of micromass culture. In addition, the effect of PKC on N-cadherin expression was blocked by the inhibition of Erk-1, suggesting that PKC action was mediated by Erk-1. A question of whether the modulation of N-cadherin expression by PKC and Erk-1 is a determinant of chondrogenesis or whether the modulation of chondrogenesis results in the altered expression of N-cadherin remains to be clarified. However, our data clearly indicate that PKC and Erk-1 signaling is closely coupled with the regulation of N-cadherin expression during chondrogenesis. In this study, we presented evidence that the expression of fibronectin and its receptor integrin α5β1 is regulated by PKC through Erk-1 signaling pathway, especially at the later stage of micromass culture,i.e. in cells cultured for 4–5 days (Fig. 8). Thus, the increased expression of integrin α5β1 and fibronectin at the later stage of micromass culture upon inhibition or depletion of PKC is closely correlated with the inhibition of chondrogenesis. On the other hand, the decreased expression of these molecules upon Erk-1 inhibition is correlated with an enhancement of chondrogenesis. The above results are consistent with the facts that an interaction of cells with fibronectin via integrin α5β1 is necessary for cell condensation to occur and that a reduction of fibronectin and its integrin α5β1 receptor after cell aggregation is necessary for the progression of cartilage differentiation (10Tavella S.

(1998)Oncogene 16, in press). Molecular cloning of the gene encoding this 32-kDa protein (TRP32) reveals that it is a novel protein of 289 amino acid residues and contains an NH2-terminal thioredoxin domain with a conserved thioredoxin active site. The human and mouse TRP32 proteins have 99% homology, and the thioredoxin domains are completely identical. The thioredoxin domain of TRP32 has thioredoxin-like reducing activity, which can reduce the interchain disulfide bridges of insulin in vitro. However, the thioredoxin domain of TRP32 is more sensitive to oxidation than human thioredoxin. Northern blot analysis showed that TRP32 is expressed in all human tissues. Expression of TRP32 was also confirmed in all mammalian cell lines tested by Western blot analysis using anti-TRP32 monoclonal antibody. Subcellular fractionation and immunostaining analysis showed TRP32 is cytoplasmic protein. These findings suggest that TRP32 is a novel cytoplasmic regulator of the redox state in higher eukaryotes.

Full-Text PDF Open Access Thioredoxin, a small protein of approximately 100 amino acid residues, is ubiquitously present and is evolutionarily conserved from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes, plants, and animals (1Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is characterized by an amino acid sequence of an active site, -Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-, conserved throughout evolution. The active site of thioredoxin is localized in a protrusion of its three-dimensional structure (4Jeng M.F. Campbell A.P. Begley T. Holmgren A. Case D.A. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. Structure. 1994; 2: 853-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and the two cysteine residues provide the sulfhydryl groups involved in the thioredoxin-dependent reducing activity. Thioredoxin exists in either a reduced form or an oxidized form. Oxidized thioredoxin, Trx-S2, where the two cysteine residues are linked by an intramolecular disulfide bond is reduced by flavoenzyme thioredoxin reductase and NADPH (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced thioredoxin, Trx-(SH)2, contains two thiol groups and can efficiently catalyze the reduction of many exposed disulfides. Thus, thioredoxin participates in various redox reactions via the reversible oxidation and reduction of the two cysteine residues in the active center. In Escherichia coli, thioredoxin was first identified as an electron donor for ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme that reduces ribonucleotides to deoxynucleotides for DNA synthesis and repair (5Laurent T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 3436-3444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).E. coli thioredoxin can also function as a hydrogen donor for 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate reductase in the sulfate assimilation pathway as well as methionine sulfoxide reductase (6Tsang M.L. Schiff J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1976; 125: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ejiri S.I. Weissbach H. Brot N. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 161-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from these functions, E. coli thioredoxin functions as the essential subunit of T7 DNA polymerase and in the maturation of filamentous bacteriophages M13 and f1 (8Chamberlin M. J. Virol. 1974; 14: 509-516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Russel M. Model P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Lim C.J. Haller B. Fuchs J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 799-802Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, thioredoxin has been implicated in a wide variety of biochemical and biological functions. It can function as a hydrogen donor, similar to the prokaryotic thioredoxin (2Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, thioredoxin can facilitate refolding of disulfide-containing proteins (11Lundstrom J. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9114-9120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modulate the activity of some transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1 (12Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A.

A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin is an efficient antioxidant, which can reduce hydrogen peroxide (14Spector A. Yan G.Z. Huang R.R. McDermott M.J. Gascoyne P.R. Pigiet V. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4984-4990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), scavenge free radicals (15Schallreuter K.U. Wood J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Yamaoka Y. Ozawa K. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1994; 42: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Another role of thioredoxin is the growth stimulation of human T cells. Adult T cell leukemia-derived factor, which augments the expression of interleukin-2 receptor, was found to be identical to human thioredoxin (17Tagaya Y. Maeda Y. Mitsui A. Kondo N. Matsui H. Hamuro J. Brown N. Arai K. Yokota T. Wakasugi H. Yodoir J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 757-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thioredoxin reportedly inhibits the expression of human immunodeficiency virus in macrophages (18Newman G.W. Balcewicz S.M. Guarnaccia J.R. Remold H.G. Silberstein D.S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A number of eukaryotic proteins are known to contain domains evolutionarily related to thioredoxin, and most of them appear to belong to the protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) 1The abbreviations used are: PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; Trx, thioredoxin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FCS, fetal calf serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; kb, kilobase pair(s); MST, mammalian STE-20-like. family, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enzymes that catalyze the rearrangement of disulfide bonds in various proteins (19Freedman R.B.

Holmgren A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar), are primarily retained within the ER lumen by the recognition system for their carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide motif, (K/H)DEL. DsbA, the bacterial functional equivalent of PDI, also contains a Trx domain and acts as a thiol:disulfide interchange protein that allows disulfide bond formation in some periplasmic proteins (23Loferer H. Hennecke H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 169-171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here we report on the biochemical purification and cloning of a novel protein, designated TRP32, which is a 32-kDa protein with an N-terminal Trx domain. TRP32 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and mammalian cell lines and localized in the cytoplasm. Human thymoma-derived cell line, HPB-ALL was cultured to 5 × 105 cells/ml in 20 liters of RPMI supplemented with 10% bovine fetal calf serum (FCS), 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were concentrated to a density of 2.5 × 107 cells/ml and stimulated with 1 μg/ml anti-Fas monoclonal antibody (CH-11) (24Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara M. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1747-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1429) Google Scholar) for 2 h. After washing once with cold PBS, cells were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell pellets were thawed on ice and suspended with 90 ml of 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin (buffer IA), and cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with 10 strokes. After centrifugation for 1 h at 100 000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was loaded onto SP Sepharose FF (20 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After adding NaCl to 0.18 m, the flow-through fraction was loaded onto HiPrep 16/10 Q Sepharose FF (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0.18–0.5 m NaCl, and the eluted fractions were assayed by an in-gel kinase assay using histone (0.3 mg/ml) as substrate as described previously (25Kameshita I. Fujisawa H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). All subsequent kinase assays in this study were performed by this method. Fractions of the 34-kDa kinase were pooled and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (10 ml, Bio-Rad), which had been equilibrated with 10 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 6.8) containing 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin (buffer HA). The column was eluted with a 250-ml gradient of 10–500 mm potassium phosphate. Fractions of the 34-kDa kinase were pooled and dialyzed against buffer QA (buffer IA containing 0.18m NaCl) and loaded onto a Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 0.18–0.5m NaCl, and the fractions of the 34-kDa kinase were concentrated to 2.5 ml by vacuum evaporation and then resolved on Hiload 16/60 Superdex 75. An aliquot of the kinase fraction was subjected to two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and analyzed by sliver staining and in-gel kinase assay. The purified fraction of the 34-kDa kinase was precipitated with an equal volume of cold acetone and dissolved in sample solution for isoelectric focusing (8 murea, 65 mm DTT, 2% Pharmalyte 3–10, 0.5% Triton X-100). After being resolved by two-dimensional SDS-PAGE using the Multiphor II system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the Investigator two-dimensional electrophoresis system (Millipore Corp.), the protein spots that co-migrated with activity by the in-gel kinase assay were recovered, crushed, and digested with lysylendopeptidase (Wako, Japan) as described (26Kawasaki H. Emori Y. Suzuki K. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 191: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). After SDS was removed with a DEAE-Tosopearl 650S column (Toso, Japan), the resulting peptide solution was separated with a reverse phase Wakopak column (Wako, Japan) and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis (Procise 492; Perkin-Elmer). Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed based on peptide sequences 1 and 2 (Fig. 1). Sense (5′-GAYCCNGAYTTYACNCCNGA-3′) and antisense (5′-GCRTCNGCNCCYTGRTAYTG-3′) primers were used to amplify cDNA fragments by reverse transcriptase PCR from the first strand cDNA of human HPB-ALL cells, which was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) with oligo(dT) primer. The resulting 290-nucleotide PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced with a model 310 genetic analyzer (Perkin-Elmer). The 290-nucleotide cDNA fragment was used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed HPB-ALL cDNA library in the pME18S vector by colony hybridization. Nine positive clones were isolated at a rate of ∼6 × 10−5 colonies. The longest 1.3-kb clone was sequenced in both directions. A mouse homologue was obtained by colony hybridization from Ba/F3 cDNA library (27Sakamaki K. Tsukumo S. Yonehara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using the human 1.3-kb cDNA as a probe. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using GeneWorks (IntelliGenetics), and public data base searches were performed using BLAST. The 1.3-kb full-length TRP32 cDNA in pME18S vector (pME18S-G14) was used as a template for PCR to create in-frame constructs for further cloning. pME18S-HA vector in which a hemagglutinin (HA) tag sequence of 11-amino acid extension is inserted after the initial methionine of the pME18S vector, was used to create HA-tagged TRP32 for mammalian expression. pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to create glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-fused TRP32. pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) was used to create histidine-tagged TRP32 and human thioredoxin for bacterial expression. The two conserved cysteine residues of the Trx-like domain in TRP32 were replaced by serine using Quick change site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The GST fusion proteins and His-tagged proteins were expressed in E. coli strain XL1blue. The expression of recombinant proteins was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 37 °C at a cell density of A 600 = 1.0. GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and eluted with glutathione as described previously (28Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were loaded onto a His-Trap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with a 5–500 mm imidazole gradient. Adult and fetal human multiple-tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized in accordance with manufacturer's instructions. A probe of 723 base pairs encoding the N-terminal 241 amino acid residues of TRP32 was generated by PCR, random-radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP, and spin column-purified (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mice were immunized with bacterially expressed GST-TRP32. Lymphocytes from the immunized mice were collected, fused with NS-1 myeloma cells, and grown in ASF104 medium (Ajinomoto, Japan) supplemented with 10% FCS and hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine for the selection of fused cells. Two cloning procedures by serial dilution were carried out after the selection, and finally all of the wells containing single clones became positive for anti-TRP32 antibody production. Cloned hybridoma cells were grown in ASF104 medium with 10% FCS until confluent, and then the hybridoma cells were moved to ASF104 medium without FCS. Culture supernatant without FCS was loaded onto protein G-Sepharose column and eluted with 50 mm glycine·HCl (pH 2.3). The eluate was immediately neutralized with 1 m Tris·HCl (pH 9.0) and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5). Cellular total proteins (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked in TBST (20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 h. Antibodies were applied to TBST containing 5% skim milk at the appropriate dilutions for 1 h. The membranes were then washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The specific signals were detected on x-ray films using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Jurkat, WR19L, HL-60, and HPB-ALL cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. KB, NIH3T3, Balb/c 3T3, HT-29, COS-7, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 μg/ml kanamycin. NIH3T3 cells were seeded at 1 × 105cells/35-mm tissue culture dish 1 day before transfection and then transfected with lipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. E. colithioredoxin (MBI Fermentas), His-tagged human thioredoxin, and His-tagged TRP32 were compared for the reducing activity of insulin disulfide bonds as described previously (29Wollman E.E. d'Auriol L. Rimsky L. Shaw A. Jacquot J.P. Wingfield P. Graber P. Dessarps F. Robin P. Galibert F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15506-15512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A reduced form of the proteins was prepared by incubating with 2 mm DTT, and oxidized proteins were prepared by incubation with 10 mm Na2SeO3 at 4 °C overnight. Then excess amounts of DTT or Na2SeO3 were removed by gel chromatography on a NAP-5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with ice-cold nitrogen equilibrated 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1 mm EDTA. The 200-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.17 mm porcine insulin (Sigma). A reaction was initiated by adding 2 mm DTT, and the absorbance at 690 nm was immediately recorded at room temperature. For subcellular fractionation, HPB-ALL cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were centrifuged at 900 × g for 10 min to obtain the nuclear pellet, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to separate the cytoplasmic fraction from the membrane fraction. The nuclear pellet and membrane pellet were washed once with PBS and suspended in lysis buffer. To investigate the subcellular localization of TRP32, NIH3T3 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding HA-tagged TRP32 using lipofectAMINE (see above). After a 36-h cultivation of the cells on chamber slides (Nunc), the cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min, and stained with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5; Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h. Slides were then washed in PBS. The secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Cappel), was used at a 1:500 dilution for 45 min. Cells were washed with PBS, incubated with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml), and washed again. Slides were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. Previously, we reported that a histone kinase with a molecular mass of 34 kDa is activated in Fas-mediated apoptosis, and this kinase was identified as catalytic fragment of MST, a STE20-related serine/threonine kinase (30Lee K.-K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16 (in press)Google Scholar). In the course of the purification of this kinase, we purified a protein of 32 kDa that was co-eluted with a catalytic fragment of MST to the final chromatographic purification step (see below). To clarify the molecular identity of this protein, we sequenced the polypeptides that were derived from proteolytic digestion with lysylendopeptidase. Eight peptide sequences were revealed (Fig. 1), and since a public data base search showed no homology to any known proteins, we tried cDNA cloning of this protein, designated TRP32. Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to peptides 1 and 2 (Fig. 1) were used for reverse transcriptase PCR using mRNA from HPB-ALL cells as a template. One cDNA fragment of 290 nucleotides was obtained and sequenced. The data base search showed that this cDNA fragment encoded a novel protein with a Trx-like domain. Using the amplified cDNA fragments as probes, we screened the human HPB-ALL cDNA library. A clone of 1.3 kb was isolated and contained a perfect Kozak consensus sequence (AGGATGG) and a stop codon upstream from the putative start codon at the 5′ side (Fig. 1). The putative polyadenylation site and poly(A) tail were also identified at the 3′ side. The 1.3-kb cDNA contained an open reading frame of 289 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular mass of 32 kDa that coincided well with the molecular weight of the purified TRP32 estimated by SDS-PAGE (see below). All eight peptide sequences obtained from the purified protein were confirmed in the open reading frame of TRP32. We also cloned a mouse homologue of human TRP32. Mouse TRP32 showed 99% homology to human TRP32, and only three amino acids were substituted. Data base searches using the BLAST program showed that the predicted amino acid sequence of the TRP32 gene was a novel protein and that the N-terminal 100 amino acid residues shared significant similarities with thioredoxin, an evolutionarily conserved ubiquitous protein that participates in various redox reactions (Fig. 2 A). The N-terminal domain of TRP32 has 43% identity and 56% similarity to human thioredoxin and has 26–29% identity and 40–43% similarity to the Trx domains of other Trx-related proteins (Fig. 2 B). All thioredoxin molecules from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes have the conserved active site sequence Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys, and in particular, two active site cysteines are preserved in all proteins containing the functional Trx domain. The Trx-like domain of TRP32 also has the active site sequence Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys. Taken together, the N-terminal 100 residues of TRP32 are closely related to thioredoxin in the primary structure. The C-terminal 190 amino acids of TRP32, however, had no similarity to any proteins in the public data bases. The C-terminal domain was rich in acidic amino acids, and the calculated pI was 4.3, similar to the theoretical and experimentally determined pI of TRP32 (see below), although it was more acidic than the N-terminal Trx-like domain (pI 7.1). The C-terminal region did not contain any predicted peptide sequences for subcellular localization or extended hydrophobic regions for secretion or membrane spanning. Northern blot analysis using poly(A+) RNA from multiple human tissues demonstrated that the TRP32 transcript was ubiquitously expressed (Fig. 3). A specific 1.4-kb mRNA was expressed at the highest levels in the heart and skeletal muscle. We prepared anti-TRP32 monoclonal antibodies and performed immunoblot analysis using one clone, LE4, that recognized the C-terminal 190 amino acids. LE4 recognized a protein of 32 kDa in all human (HPB-ALL, Jurkat, 293, KB), mouse (NIH3T3, Balb/c 3T3), and monkey (COS-7) cells examined (Fig. 4). A band with the same molecular weight was also detected by LE4 in the highly purified TRP32 fraction. In addition, recombinant HA-tagged TRP32 (HA-TRP32), with an 11-amino acid extension at the N terminus, could be detected as a slower migrating band on Western blots with LE4. 2K.-K. Lee and S. Yonehara, unpublished data. These results show that LE4 specifically recognizes TRP32. Taken together, both the TRP32 transcript and protein are ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and various mammalian cell lines.Figure 4Expression of the TRP32 proteins. TRP32 protein was detected by Western blotting using anti-TRP32 monoclonal antibody, LE4, in various cell lines as indicated. The experiment was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Highly purified TRP32 fraction from Mono-Q column chromatography was also detected by immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Final chromatographic fractions from the Superdex 75 gel filtration were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. A doublet with a molecular mass of 32 kDa, which was identified as TRP32 by peptide sequencing, was eluted at the expected elution volume from its molecular weight (Fig. 5 A). The anti-TRP32 antibody, LE4, also specifically recognized doublet bands of 32 kDa, proving the LE4-reactive proteins to be TRP32 (Fig. 5 B). The purified TRP32 might be modified or cleaved during chromatographic procedures because TRP32 was detected as a single band in the total cell lysates (Fig. 4). Only a single band of TRP32 was also observed in apoptosis-induced HPB-ALL cells. 2K.-K. Lee and S. Yonehara, unpublished data. The elution pattern of TRP32 by gel filtration chromatography was nearly identical to that of the kinase-active catalytic fragment of MST (Fig. 5, C andD), confirming the co-purification of these two proteins. TRP32 and the catalytic fragment of MST were superimposable even in the two-dimensional electrophoresis analysis (30Lee K.-K. Murakawa M. Nishida E. Tsubuki S. Kawashima S. Sakamaki K. Yonehara S. Oncogene. 1998; 16 (in press)Google Scholar) with a molecular mass of 32–34 kDa and isoelectric point (pI) of 5.2 (Fig. 5 E). The pI of purified TRP32 was slightly higher than the theoretical value of 4.6. To investigate the Trx-like reducing activity of TRP32, we expressed recombinant TRP32 and human thioredoxin as His-tagged forms (His-TRP32 and His-Trx) inE. coli. A truncated TRP32 (His-TRP32N) consisting of N-terminal Trx-like 107 amino acid residues was also prepared. In addition, Cys → Ser mutants, His-TRP32(C34S,C37S) and His-TRP32N(C34S,C37S), in which the two cysteines (Cys34and Cys37) homologous to those in the thioredoxin active site were mutated to serines, were generated from His-TRP32 and His-TRP32N, respectively. The expressed recombinant proteins were purified by His-Trap column chromatography. His-TRP32N showed reducing activity for the insulin disulfide bonds with kinetics slower than that of His-Trx (Fig. 6 A) but faster than that of purified E. coli thioredoxin. His-TRP32N(C34S,C37S) completely failed to reduce insulin, indicating that the N-terminal Trx-like domain of TRP32 is functionally related to thioredoxin. However, full-length His-TRP32 failed to reduce insulin, suggesting that the C-terminal region may regulate the activity of the N-terminal Trx domain or that bacterially expressed His-TRP32 may not be folded to its native structure. We tested the effect of the C-terminal region on the N-terminal reducing activity by mixing His-TRP32C (residue 107–289). However, His-TRP32C did not inhibit the reducing activity of His-TRP32N even in the presence of a 5-fold molar excess. In addition, direct interaction between the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of TRP32 could not be detected either in vitro or in vivo. 2K.-K. Lee and S. Yonehara, unpublished data. We studied the effect of oxidation on the reducing activity of the His-TRP32N (Fig. 6 B). The reducing activity of oxidized His-TRP32N had not recovered after 2 h of incubation with DTT, although His-Trx rapidly recovered the reducing activity within 5 min in the presence of DTT, suggesting that reduction to reductase-active His-TRP32N by DTT is a time-consuming and rate-limiting process. These results imply that the Trx domain of TRP32 is functionally related to thioredoxin but not identical. To investigate the subcellular distribution of endogenous TRP32, we prepared subcellular fractions from HPB-ALL cells. The endogenous TRP32 was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction. 2K.-K. Lee and S. Yonehara, unpublished data. The cytoplasmic distribution of TRP32 did not change when HPB-ALL cells underwent apoptosis by treatment with the anti-Fas monoclonal antibody, CH-11. NIH3T3 cells were transiently transfected with HA-TRP32, and the localization of expressed protein was visualized using the anti-HA monoclonal antibody. HA-TRP32 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, confirming the result of the subcellular fractionation. 2K.-K. Lee and S. Yonehara, unpublished data. We have purified a protein with a molecular mass of 32 kDa, which was co-purified with the catalytic fragment of protein kinase MST. cDNA cloning of the gene encoding this protein, TRP32 (thioredoxin-related protein of32 kDa), shows that TRP32 is a novel protein containing one Trx domain. Human and mouse TRP32 proteins are 99% identical, and in particular, the Trx domains are completely homologous. We also identified a Drosophila expressed sequence tag (GenBankTM accession number AA264961) whose predicted N-terminal 100 residues are similar to the Trx domain of TRP32 (48% identity). This clone may be a Drosophila homologue of TRP32 because the adjacent region to the Trx domain (100–150 residues) shows high homology to the C-terminal domain of TRP32, which has no similarity to any proteins in the public data bases. However, we could not identify any putative TRP32 homologue in E. coli or yeast genome sequences. Thus, TRP32 may be evolutionarily conserved in multicellular eukaryotes. TRP32 seems to be closely related to thioredoxin. The Trx domain of TRP32 is most similar to thioredoxin in mammalian Trx-related proteins. TRP32 is widely expressed in human tissues, and expression of TRP32 protein has been confirmed in various mammalian cell lines (Figs. 3 and4). The recombinant Trx domain of TRP32 (His-TRP32N) has reducing activity comparable with human thioredoxin (Fig. 6). TRP32 is localized in the cytoplasm. TRP32 might have acquired specialized functions in multicellular eukaryotes during evolution from thioredoxin, which is conserved from prokaryotes to animals. Despite the high similarity of the two proteins, however, some functional and structural differences were observed. The Trx domain of TRP32 is more sensitive to oxidation than thioredoxin, and full-length TRP32 has no reducing activity (Fig. 6). Mammalian thioredoxin contains other conserved cysteine residues in addition to the two cysteine residues in the active site. The human thioredoxin contains three such extra cysteine residues (Fig. 2 A). These noncatalytic cysteine residues, Cys62, Cys69, and Cys73, in human thioredoxin can reportedly undergo oxidation, which leads to inactivation and dimerization of thioredoxin (31Ren X. Bjornstedt B. Shen B. Ericson M.-L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In particular, Cys73, located on the surface close to the active site, is reportedly linked to the redox regulation of human thioredoxin (32Qin J. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 503-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 33Forman-Kay J.D. Clore G.M. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2685-2698Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, the Trx domain of TRP32 has only one extra cysteine residue, Cys64, corresponding to the Cys62 of human thioredoxin. Cys73 of human thioredoxin is replaced by Ala in TRP32, which is also changed to Gly74 in E. coli thioredoxin. Thus, the reducing activity of TRP32 may be differently regulated from mammalian thioredoxin, and TRP32 is functionally different from thioredoxin, since the C-terminal region of TRP32 may regulate the reducing activity (Fig. 6). The C-terminal region of human TRP32 does not have homology to other proteins but is conserved in mouse and probablyDrosophila, suggesting its functional importance. The role of the C-terminal region of TRP32 should be elucidated. The function of TRP32 may be also different from that of the PDI family because TRP32 has no homology to PDI except in the Trx domain. Furthermore, the Trx domain of TRP32 is significantly different from PDI. TRP32 has one Trx domain, but two or three Trx domains exist in the PDI family. In addition, TRP32 and mammalian thioredoxins have the conserved active site sequence, Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys, in which the third Pro is replaced by His in the PDI family (Fig. 2 B). Pro → His-replaced thioredoxin reportedly shows increased reduction potential and can complement the PDI null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisae (34Chivers P.T. Laboissiere M.C. Raines R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2659-2667Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), implying that the Trx domain of TRP32 is biochemically and biologically different from that of PDI. Different localization of two proteins, PDI in ER and TRP32 in cytoplasm, also suggests different functions in the different environments. Recently, two new mammalian Trx-related proteins have been reported (Table I). Trx2 (35Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda V.A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), which consists of 166 amino acid residues with the active site sequences found in mammalian thioredoxin, has higher homology with the E. colithioredoxin than with the known mammalian proteins. Trx2 has a mitochondrial translocation signal, and the mature protein is localized in mitochondria. Kurooka et al. (36Kurooka H. Kato K. Minoguchi S. Takahashi Y. Ikeda J. Habu S. Osawa N. Buchberg A.M. Moriwaki K. Shisa H. Honjo T. Genomics. 1997; 39: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) reported another Trx-related nuclear protein, nucleoredoxin. Nucleoredoxin has one Trx domain in the central region with a modified active site sequence, -Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys, but it can reduce insulin disulfide in vitro. The second Pro residue in the active site sequence is quite rare, and no other proteins with Pro in this residue have been reported. Nucleoredoxin is localized in the nucleus when overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells. TRP32 may be also functionally different from these two proteins. First, these proteins have no homologous regions except the Trx domain and show a low homology only at the sequences surrounding the active site of the Trx domain. Second, their subcellular localizations are completely different. Trx2 and nucleoredoxin are mitochondrial and nuclear protein, respectively, whereas TRP32 is a cytoplasmic protein. The restricted localization of these proteins including PDI may reflect their specific roles in different subcellular compartments.Table IMammalian Trx-related proteinsTrx-related proteinMolecular massLocalizationEvolutionary conservationFunctionskDaTrx12Cytoplasm MembraneAll speciesReduction of protein disulfide.

The DNA binding activity of some transcription factors, including AP-1, NF-κB, Myb, and Ets are known to be regulated by a thiol-redox control mechanism (37Abate C. Patel L. Rauscher F.D. Curran T. Science. 1990; 249: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 38Wasylyk C. Wasylyk B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 39Myrset A.H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2279-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin augments the DNA binding and transcription activities of the p50 subunit of NF-κB by reducing Cys62 in its DNA-binding loop (41Matthews J.R. Wakasugi N. Virelizier J.L. Yodoi J. Hay R.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3821-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 42Okamoto T. Ogiwara H. Hayashi T. Mitsui A. Kawabe T. Yodoi J. Int. Immunol. 1992; 4: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin enhances the DNA binding activity of Jun and Fos (12Meyer M. Schreck R. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2005-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 13Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrugger W. Droge W. Schulze O.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Furthermore, thioredoxin translocates from the cytoplasm into the nucleus by treatment with PMA and UV irradiation in a nucleus localization signal-independent manner (43Hirota K. Matsui M. Iwata S. Nishiyama A. Mori K. Yodoi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar,44Masutani H. Hirota K. Sasada T. Ueda T.Y. Taniguchi Y. Sono H. Yodoi J. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It may be interesting to investigate whether TRP32 has such a redox activity on transcription factors and whether it signal-dependently translocates into the nucleus. Another possible function of TRP32 is the regulation of apoptosis. Reactive oxygen intermediates are implicated in apoptosis (32Qin J. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Structure. 1994; 2: 503-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Some process of apoptosis might be regulated by the cellular redox state, and TRP32 may regulate apoptosis through the control of the redox state. TRP32 was co-purified with the catalytic fragment of MST, which is proteolytically activated by caspase in apoptosis. The possibility cannot be excluded that TRP32 controls apoptosis by regulating the activity of MST and/or vice versa, although our preliminary experiment does not show co-immunoprecipitation of TRP32 and the catalytic fragment of MST. 2K.-K. Lee and S. Yonehara, unpublished data. A study of TRP32 upon apoptosis is currently under way. Our cloning of a novel human thioredoxin-related protein may contribute to elucidating the regulation of the redox state in cells, and the function of TRP32 should be further clarified.

https://openalex.org/W2039441286,"Sialylation of glycoproteins and glycolipids plays an important role during development, regeneration, and pathogenesis of diseases. During times of intense plasticity within the nervous system, such as development and regeneration, sialylation of neural cells is distinct from the time of its maintenance. In this study, a synthetic precursor of neuraminic acid,N-propanoylmannosamine (N-propanoyl neuraminic acid precursor (P-NAP)), is applied to the culture medium of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, microglia, astrocytes, and neurons from neonatal rat brains to alter sialylation of glycoconjugates within these cells. P-NAP is metabolized and incorporated as N-propanoyl neuraminic acid into glycoproteins of the cell membrane. P-NAP stimulates the proliferation of astrocytes and microglia but not of oligodendrocyte progenitor in vitro. However, P-NAP increases the number of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells expressing the early oligodendroglial surface marker A2B5 epitope. In the presence of P-NAP, cerebellar neurons (but not astrocytes) in microexplant cultures start to express the oligodendroglial progenitor marker A2B5 epitope, which is normally undetectable on these cells. The controls, which were performed in the absence of any additive or in the presence of the physiological precursor of neuraminic acid,N-acetylmannosamine, did not show any increase in A2B5 expression.

Cell surface components such as terminal neuraminic acids of glycoconjugates orchestrate a variety of biological functions such as proliferation, cell-cell interaction, and migration (for a review, see Ref. 1Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). One strategy to interfere with cell surface neuraminic acids,i.e. sialylation, is to exploit its natural metabolism. It was shown earlier that synthetic neuraminic acid precursors that do not occur naturally are tolerated and metabolized by different cells (2Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16934-16938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,3Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W. Pawlita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). New strategies for remodeling cell surfaces emerge from these findings, since they offer a possibility to introduce also (nonphysiological) reactive functional groups on the surface of cells (4Mahal L.K. Yarema K.J. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). The consequences of such remodeling must be analyzed for the distinct cell types of different organs, particularly in our case the mammalian brain. Numerous studies on the function of sialic acids in the immune system have shown that they contribute to its regulation (for a review, see Ref. 5Pilatte Y. Bignon J. Lambre C.R. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, the role of sialic acids is complex and diverse. For example, sialic acids facilitate the binding affinities of the host endogenous cell membrane for factors involved in the regulation of the complement system (5Pilatte Y. Bignon J. Lambre C.R. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 201-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 198: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 7Frank M.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1992; 4: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The content of sialic acids on the surface of cells also determines the recognition by phagocytes as desialylated erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes are phagocytosed by macrophages (8Schauer R. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1982; 40: 131-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 9Kluge A. Reuter G. Lee H. Ruch Heeger B. Schauer R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, sialic acids act in concert with selectins during the first steps in the homing of blood cells, thus being involved in cell-cell adhesion. In some systems, the higher the content of sialic acids on cell surface molecules, the lower their binding efficiency to their receptors, as has been shown for the leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 binding to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (10Diamond M.S. Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Springer T.A. Cell. 1991; 65: 961-971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). To study the biological functions of N-acetylneuraminic acid, there are, in principle, two possibilities. First,N-acetylneuraminic acid can be removed from the cell surface by the use of neuraminidases. Second, it is also possible to influence specific functions of neuraminic acid by application of synthetic, unnatural N-acylmannosamines, which serve as precursors for neuraminic acid. These precursors, such asN-propanoylmannosamine (N-propanoyl-substituted neuraminic acid precursor (P-NAP) 1The abbreviations used are: P-NAP,N-propanoyl neuraminic acid precursor; A-NAP,N-acetylneuraminic acid precursor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. ), are metabolized and incorporated as N-propanoyl neuraminic acid into glycoconjugates of cells in vivo and in vitro by simple application to the cell's exterior (Refs. 2Kayser H. Zeitler R. Kannicht C. Grunow D. Nuck R. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16934-16938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M. Kayser H. Grunow D.

FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; this study). In vitro experiments revealed that biological functions such as virus infection and cell proliferation can be influenced by altering the neuraminic acid composition. For example, the application of P-NAP to an epithelial cell line results in the partial replacement of N-acetylneuraminic acid byN-propanoyl neuraminic acid by about 50% (3Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W. Pawlita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). This modification inhibits the sialic acid-dependent infection of these cells with primate polyomaviruses (3Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W. Pawlita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Furthermore, human fibroblasts lose their density-dependent inhibition of proliferation when treated with P-NAP (12Wieser J.R. Heisner A. Stehling P. Oesch F. Reutter W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 395: 170-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In our studies, we concentrate on the individual cell types of the mammalian central nervous system. We applied the unnatural sialic acid precursor P-NAP to cell cultures enriched for three glial cell types and to cerebellar microexplant cultures of the developing rat brain. These microexplants contain neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and additionally progenitors of myelin-forming oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells are proliferative and migratory, features that have been proposed to play also an important role in the regeneration of the adult nervous system when naturally occurring cell death or myelin damage requires compensation (for a review, see Ref.13). Cerebellar microexplant cultures serve as a model system to study the outgrowth pattern of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, astrocytes, and neurons as well as neurite fasciculation (14Fischer G. Künemund V. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 605-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schmidt C. Künemund V. Wintergerst E.S. Schmitz B. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 12-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). They were maintained in the presence of synthetic neuraminic acid precursors to study some of these aspects. We also used enriched cell cultures to compare proliferative effects of P-NAP on the three glial cell types. We show that P-NAP is metabolized by glial cells in culture and is expressed as N-propanoyl neuraminic acid in glycoproteins of the cell membrane. P-NAP induces the proliferation of astrocytes and microglia but not of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Instead, we provide evidence that P-NAP-treatment of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and cerebellar neurons induces the expression of the A2B5 epitope. P-NAP increases the number of A2B5-positive early oligodendrocytes. The A2B5 antibody has been described as reacting with gangliosides of neural tissues (16Eisenbarth G.S. Walsh F.S. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 75: 4913-4917Google Scholar, 17Fredman P. Magnani J.L. Nirenberg M. Ginsburg V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Dubois C. Manuguerra J.C. Hauttecoeur B. Maze J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2797-2803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been regarded as a specific marker for a subset of rat oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (for a review, see Ref. 19Cameron R.S. Rakic P. Glia. 1991; 4: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). However, some rat neurons in culture have also been shown to carry the A2B5 epitope (20Ashton F, A. Levison S.W. McCarthy K.D. Brain Res. 1990; 529: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Although cerebellar neurons do not express the A2B5 epitope under the culture conditions of our experiments, they start to express this epitope on their neurites after application of P-NAP. Mixed glial cell cultures from whole brains of neonatal Wistar rats were prepared according to the method of McCarthy and de Vellis (21McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3403) Google Scholar). It is well established that neurons do not survive under these culture conditions. After 7–14 days in culture, microglia and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were sequentially shaken off the confluent astrocyte monolayers and plated onto glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (P1524; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany; 20 μg/ml in water). Remaining astrocytes were detached from the culture flasks after 5 min of trypsinization according to standard procedures. Oligodendroglia, mainly comprising oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, were plated at a density of 5 × 104, microglia were plated at a density of 2.5 × 104 (low density) or 1 × 105, astrocytes at a density of 1 × 105 cells/coverslip (11 mm diameter). Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were maintained in Sato medium (supplemented with 1% horse serum (22Bottenstein J.E. Sato G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 514-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar)). Microglia and astrocytes were maintained in basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. Enriched cell cultures were maintained for 1–3 days in the presence or absence of unnatural or naturally occurring neuraminic acid precursors (see below). PC12 cells were grown in plastic dishes, 35 mm in diameter, coated with collagen I (20 μg/ml, Sigma) using RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. Differentiation and neurite outgrowth was stimulated with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (Boehringer Mannheim) (23Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). Cerebella of 6–7-day-old Wistar rats were prepared as described earlier (15Schmidt C. Künemund V. Wintergerst E.S. Schmitz B. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 12-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In brief, cerebelli were freed from the meninges, choroid plexus, and deep cerebellar nuclei. The remaining cerebellar cortex was then forced through a Nitrex nylon mesh (pore size 300 μm) and washed three times in Sato medium. Explants were plated on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (20 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)) and maintained for up to 5 days in culture in Sato medium in the presence or absence of the novel neuraminic acid precursor. Under these conditions, cells migrated out of the explants within a few days. The distances migrated by the different cell types from the explant cores were calculated as the mean of each cell type that had migrated the farthest from the rims of the explant cores. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity. The physiological precursor for neuraminic acid isN-acetylmannosamine (N-acetylneuraminic acid precursor (A-NAP)). A-NAP was purchased from Sigma. The synthetic derivative of neuraminic acid precursor P-NAP is not commercially available and was synthesized as described by Keppler et al.(3Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W. Pawlita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). All staining procedures were performed as described by Schmidtet al. (24Schmidt C. Ohlemeyer C. Labrakakis C. Walter T. Kettenmann H. Schnitzer J. Glia. 1997; 20: 284-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PC12 cells, primary cultures of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, astrocytes, microglia, or cerebellar microexplant cultures were immunohistochemically stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against A2B5-, O4-, or O7 antigen, respectively, and/or with polyclonal antibodies directed against the neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (25Rathjen F.G. Schachner M. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Staining was done on nonfixed cells. Immunocytochemistry with polyclonal antibodies against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and with myelin basic protein was performed with paraformaldehyde-fixed cells. If cells were not fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde before immunocytochemistry, they were fixed prior to embedding with Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany). A2B5, O4, and myelin basic protein antibodies were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. O7 antibodies were a kind gift of Dr. I. Sommer (University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK). Polyclonal L1 antibodies have been described by Park et al. (26Park T.-U. Lucka L. Reutter W. Horstkorte R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Dichlorotriazinyl amino fluorescein- or Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). For A2B5 and O4 immunocytochemistry, chain-specific Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies were used. Glycolipids dissolved in methanol were added to the wells of 96-well microtiter plates (50 μl/well; Falcon 3912) and adsorbed to the plastic by evaporating the methanol at room temperature. Glycoproteins of crude membranes solubilized in buffer containing 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton, and a protease inhibitor mixture (P 8340, Sigma) at pH 7.4 were also added to the wells of 96-well microtiter plates (50 μl/well) and adsorbed to the plastic by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (200 μl/well) for 1 h at room temperature. After wells were washed three times with PBS, they were incubated for 1 h with monoclonal antibodies to neural cell adhesion molecule (5B8; Hybridoma Bank) or A2B5 epitope (0.2 μg/ml, 100 μl/well) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Plates were again washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin; bound secondary antibodies were visualized by incubation with H2O2 and 2,2-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate-6 (Sigma) as horseradish peroxidase substrates, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The color reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.6% aqueous SDS, and the optical density of the reaction products was determined at 405 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader. The proliferation of cells in single cell cultures was analyzed using the 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling and detection kit III from Boehringer Mannheim. Labeling was performed according to the supplier's instructions in 24-well plates. Single cells were allowed to settle for 4 h before the addition of any neuraminic acid precursor or growth factors. The platelet-derived growth factor (Boehringer Mannheim) and basic fibroblast growth factor (British Bio-Technology Limited, Oxford, UK) were both used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml as a positive control for the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cell cultures (27Noble M. Murray K. Stroobant P. Waterfield M.D. Riddle P. Nature. 1988; 333: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 28Bogler O. Wren D. Barnett S.C. Land H. Noble M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6368-6372Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Murine macrophage colony-stimulating factor (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) turned out to be a potent stimulator of rat microglia proliferation at a concentration of 30 ng/ml (this study) and was therefore used as a positive control for these cultures. Astrocytes and microglia were incubated for 2–3 days with BrdUrd and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells for 1–2 days, depending on the age of the primary cultures from which these cells were shaken off. In each experiment (with double values) the background, omitting BrdUrd, was subtracted. Mixed glia cultures were maintained for 3 days in the presence of 5 mm A-NAP or P-NAP before cells were scratched off and pelleted. Cell pellets (107 cells) were lysed by hypotonic shock in distilled water and repeated freezing and thawing (two times). The crude membrane fractions were pelleted by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min (4 °C). The pellets were lyophilized. Glycolipids were extracted using methanol/chloroform (1:2, 1:1, 2:1 (v/v)) for 30 min each and centrifugation at 10,000 ×g (30 min, 4 °C). Glycolipid-containing methanol/chloroform supernatants were collected and lyophilized. Dried samples were hydrolyzed for 2 h with 200 μl of 2 macetic acid. The pH values of the hydrolysates were adjusted to 4, and further purification was carried out on a cation exchanger (AG-50W-X12, H+ form; Bio-Rad, München, Germany). Glycoprotein-containing pellets were hydrolyzed and purified as described for glycolipids. Purified eluted neuraminic acids were fluorescence-labeled according to Hara et al. (29Hara S. Takemori Y. Yamaguchi M. Nakamura M. Ohkura Y. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 164: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Labeled neuraminic acids were chromatographed using a reversed phase C18 column (Lichrosorb C18, 5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm; Knauer, Berlin, Germany) with a fluorescence detector (Ginkotek; excitation wavelength, 377 nm; emission wavelength, 448 nm). Eluent A contained distilled water, while eluent B contained acetonitrile/methanol (60:40, v/v). The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and separations were carried out using a gradient that first ran for 20 min in the isocratic mode with 10% B; then B was raised to 25% within 25 min and finally to 50% within another 15 min. Eluted neuraminic acids were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight mass spectrometry and quantified using defined standards as performed and described in Keppler et al. (3Keppler O.T. Stehling P. Herrmann M. Kayser H. Grunow D. Reutter W. Pawlita M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1308-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cerebellar microexplants from neonatal brains mostly consist of small cerebellar neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (14Fischer G. Künemund V. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 605-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schmidt C. Künemund V. Wintergerst E.S. Schmitz B. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 12-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). They send out radially oriented, partly fasciculated neurites (14Fischer G. Künemund V. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 605-612Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schmidt C. Künemund V. Wintergerst E.S. Schmitz B. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 43: 12-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), which we also detected under our culture conditions (Fig. 1, A,D, and F; open arrows). Cells of different morphologies left the explant cores within 5 days in culture; most of them exhibited small and round cell bodies (Fig. 1,A and D, arrowheads). Due to their morphology, these cells were regarded as small cerebellar neurons. When the explants were treated with 5 mm P-NAP (Fig. 1 D), there was no significant difference in the outgrowth pattern of these neurons when compared with the control in the absence of neuraminic acid precursors (Fig. 1 A). It is well established that the proliferative and migratory active pool of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells differentiates into cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage and astrocytes, depending on the culture conditions (19Cameron R.S. Rakic P. Glia. 1991; 4: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 30Lillien L.E. Raff M.C. Neuron. 1990; 5: 111-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Progressive developmental stages of oligodendrocytes are distinguishable by their sequential expression of antigenic markers. One of the first identifiable markers of a subset of very early progenitors is the A2B5 epitope, which is followed by O4 expression before differentiation occurs into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (for a review, see Ref. 19Cameron R.S. Rakic P. Glia. 1991; 4: 124-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). When cerebellar explants were maintained in the presence of P-NAP for 5 days and immunostained with the A2B5 antibody, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells with typically elongated cell bodies and a few processes had migrated out of the explant cores (Figs. 1 F and 4 C,arrows). These A2B5-positive cells were exclusively found in the presence of P-NAP (Fig. 1 F) but not in the presence of physiological A-NAP (Fig. 2) or in the absence of neuraminic acid precursors (Fig. 1 C). A2B5-positive cells were already detected after 1 day in culture in the presence of 5 mm P-NAP and predominantly exhibited a bipolar morphology (not shown). Under control conditions, in the absence of P-NAP, A2B5-positive cells appeared after 3 days in culture with a weaker A2B5 staining (not shown) and were no longer detected after 5 days (Fig. 1 C).Figure 2A2B5-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells migrated distinct distances from cerebellar microexplants.Explants from 6-day-old rats were maintained for 5 days in the presence of up to 50 mm P-NAP or 50 mm A-NAP. Significant numbers of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells appear with 0.5 mm P-NAP and do not appear with maximal concentrations of A-NAP. Bars, mean values ± S.E. of one representative experiment out of three with at least 12 explants analyzed within each group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The A2B5-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells had migrated a significant distance from the rim of the explant cores (Fig. 1 F, arrows, and Fig. 2). The distances migrated by these A2B5-positive cells that had migrated from the explant cores were dose-dependent and became maximal with 5 mm P-NAP (Fig. 2). Proliferation assays were not performed in these cultures due to the low overall number of cells outside the explant cores (but see below). When microexplant cultures were stained with O4 antibodies, more mature oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were seen in the presence and in the absence of P-NAP (Fig. 3). There was also no effect of P-NAP on the distances of O4-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells that had migrated from the rims of the explants (Fig. 3). Immunostaining with antibodies against later mature developmental stages of the oligodendroglial lineage such as O7 or myelin basic protein antibodies did not show significant numbers of positive cells (not shown). The area covered by GFAP-positive astrocytes was also not affected by P-NAP as compared with the control (Fig. 1, Band E). Neurites extending from rat cerebellar microexplants normally do not express the A2B5 epitope. In the presence of P-NAP (Fig. 1, open arrows), neurites become strongly A2B5-positive (for comparison see Fig. 1,C and F). A2B5-positive neurites were already seen after 1 day in culture (not shown). The cell bodies of the morphologically identified small cerebellar neurons (Fig. 1,arrowheads) were not stained by A2B5 antibodies (Fig. 1, compare D and F). In the presence of P-NAP, A2B5 expression on neurites coincided with the expression of the neuronal marker L1 (Fig. 4, compare B and C, open arrows). This confirms that these A2B5-positive processes are of neuronal origin. A2B5 expression on the neurites of the small cerebellar neurons was prominent at a concentration of 5 mm P-NAP as seen in Figs. 1 F and 4 C but was not seen with lower concentrations of P-NAP (0.05 and 0.5 mm; data not shown). A2B5-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and their processes were not positive for the neuronal marker L1 as shown for the cells in Fig. 4, B and C (arrows). Neurites of nerve growth factor-differentiated PC12 cells did not express the A2B5 epitope in the presence of P-NAP after 5 days in culture (not shown). GFAP-positive astrocytes of the microexplant cultures are also negative for the A2B5 epitope (Fig. 1, compareE and F). Cell cultures enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were maintained for up to 5 days in the presence of P-NAP or A-NAP both at a concentration of 5 mm. For all further experiments, this concentration was used because it showed the most prominent effects on the presence of A2B5-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells outside the microexplant cultures (Fig. 2). After treatment with P-NAP, the number of A2B5-expressing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells increased in comparison with A-NAP-treated cultures and with control cultures in the absence of neuraminic acid precursors after 24 and 48 h (Fig. 5 A). The morphology of A2B5-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells was the same under all conditions. We observed a decrease in the total number of A2B5-positive cells from 24 h to 5 days in culture (Fig. 5 A) and a continuous increase in O4-positive oligodendrocyte progenitor cells under all conditions (Fig. 5 B) implicating a progressive differentiation of the cells. Although the number of A2B5-positive cells increased in the presence of P-NAP, the number of O4-positive cells was not significantly different at each time point selected. We performed proliferation assays using the incorporation of BrdUrd as a measure to answer the following questions: 1) is the increase in the number of A2B5-positive cells in the presence of P-NAP due to an increase in the proliferation rate of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells? and 2) are other glial cell types of the mammalian brain such as astrocytes or microglia also influenced by synthetic P-NAP? Cell cultures enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, astrocytes, or microglia were maintained in 5 mm P-NAP or A-NAP for 3 days. Proliferation of microglia was specifically stimulated by P-NAP and not by A-NAP, whereas proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells was not significantly altered by any neuraminic acid precursor (Fig. 6). Astrocyte cultures were stimulated by both A-NAP and P-NAP (Fig. 6). The specific proliferative effect of P-NAP for microglia was also seen when cells were plated at low density (2.5 × 104; data not shown). Mixed glial cultures were maintained for 3 days in the presence of P-NAP or A-NAP, both at 5 mm in the culture medium. To prove that glial cells can synthesize N-propanoyl neuraminic acid from the appropriate precursor (P-NAP), all sialic acid components of membrane glycoproteins or glycolipids present in mixed glial cultures were isolated and quantified. After HPLC purification of hydrolyzed glycoconjugates, 180 pmol of neuraminic acids/107 cells could be isolated from glycoprotein fractions of both P-NAP- and A-NAP-treated cultures (Fig. 7). When mixed glial cultures were maintained in the presence of A-NAP, these 180 pmol of neuraminic acids were represented only as N-acetylneuraminic acid, whereas in the presence of P-NAP, 42 pmol (or 23%) of all neuraminic acids were represented by N-propanoyl neuraminic acid (Fig. 7). In a second series of experiments, the incorporation ofN-propanoyl neuraminic acid into glycolipids was analyzed. No N-propanoyl neuraminic acid could be detected in any glycolipid fraction (data not shown). This shows that P-NAP was metabolized and incorporated only in glycoproteins under our culture conditions. To exclude the possibility that mixed glial cultures express the A2B5 epitope on glycoproteins after growing in the presence of P-NAP, we performed dot-blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We found A2B5 immunoreactivity only in the glycolipid fraction of cells grown in the presence of P-NAP and not in any glycoprotein fraction (data not shown). We have shown that mixed glial cell cultures metabolize synthetic neuraminic acid precursors and express them as novel, modified neuraminic acids on their cell surfaces after we simply added these substances to the culture medium. It is thus possible to biochemically engineer sialylation, i.e. the composition of sialylated glycoproteins. This precursor is not cytotoxic, as we confirmed for neural cells in this study. We demonstrate a differential role of P-NAP on the proliferation of various cell types of the central nervous system. In contrast to oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, microglia were stimulated to proliferate in the presence of P-NAP. This proliferation was independent of the density of cells used for the assay. A role for cell-cell contact in the P-NAP-dependent process of proliferation seems, therefore, unlikely. Astrocytes were stimulated to proliferate by P-NAP and also by A-NAP, the physiological neuraminic acid precursors. This might be explained by a general shortage ofN-acetylneuraminic acid for maximal proliferation of astrocytes under the culture conditions used in our studies. In our present study, we support previous findings that sialic acids might play a role in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell migration. The potential of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to migrate represents a form of plasticity within the nervous system, and this not only occurs during development but also during adulthood. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells can migrate to demyelinated regions when transplanted at a distance (31Vignais L. Nait Oumesnar B. Mellouk F. Gout O. Labourdette G. Baron-Van Evercooren A. Gumpel M. Int. J. Dev. Neurosci. 1993; 11: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). It is the A2B5-positive rather than the more mature O4-positive cell type that migrates considerable distances and is able to remyelinate (32Warrington A.E. Barbarese E. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in culture that were maintained in the presence of P-NAP transiently accumulated or were retained in an A2B5-positive developmental stage. The functional role of the A2B5 epitope, which is described to be part of gangliosides (16Eisenbarth G.S. Walsh F.S. Nirenberg M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 75: 4913-4917Google Scholar, 17Fredman P. Magnani J.L. Nirenberg M. Ginsburg V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 233: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 18Dubois C. Manuguerra J.C. Hauttecoeur B. Maze J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2797-2803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has not yet been determined, but the A2B5-positive stage of oligodendrocytes has been shown to correlate with the migratory active phase of these cells in vitro (24Schmidt C. Ohlemeyer C. Labrakakis C. Walter T. Kettenmann H. Schnitzer J. Glia. 1997; 20: 284-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and in vivo(32Warrington A.E. Barbarese E. Pfeiffer S.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 34: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The application of the naturally not occurring P-NAP but not of the physiological A-NAP led to an accumulation of potentially migratory active oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in vitro. This was not due to proliferation. It is not clear whether oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which are not positive for the A2B5 epitope are forced by P-NAP to become A2B5-positive or whether P-NAP forces A2B5-positive cells to remain in this state. If the A2B5 epitope is considered to be a functional marker of cells of the early oligodendrocyte lineage, P-NAP can be considered as a potent regulator of the lineage progression of oligodendrocytes at early stages of their development. In agreement with these findings, P-NAP did not influence the number of the more mature O4-positive cells. Unfortunately, there was no other specific marker available to immunostain oligodendrocyte progenitor cells that would recognize the same early stage of the oligodendroglial lineage as does the A2B5 antibody. Although we observed a dose-dependent effect of P-NAP on the distances oligodendrocyte progenitor cells migrated out of the cerebellar explants in culture, this does not necessarily mean that single cells have an increased velocity. Another possibility is that with increasing P-NAP concentration more oligodendrocyte progenitor cells might stay in the A2B5-positive developmental stage, and/or this potentially active migratory phase might be prolonged. Based on our results, we suggest that nontoxic agents such as P-NAP that sustain this A2B5-positive state may support regenerative events in this respect. It is not very likely that N-propanoyl neuraminic acid itself is recognized by the A2B5 antibody, since astrocytes, PC12 cells and microglia, which also metabolize P-NAP, were A2B5-negative. Furthermore, the finding that A2B5 immunoreactivity is not detectable on glycoproteins of mixed glial cultures grown in the presence of P-NAP is another indication that P-NAP itself is not recognized by the A2B5. The only cells that are induced to express the A2B5 epitope by P-NAP are those that carry, at a crucial point of their development, this particular epitope, namely oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and subsets of neurons. We claim that P-NAP treatment of neurons can induce antigen expression, as we have exemplified by the P-NAP-specific induction of the A2B5-antigen on the surface of neurites of cerebellar neurons in vitro. This is in congruence with findings that P-NAP can induce the expression of β1-integrins in some tumor cell lines. 2C. Schüler, personal communication. Any functional consequence of P-NAP-induced A2B5 expression on neurons is of potential interest and remains to be elucidated.

The phenotypes result from defects of collagen VII, the major component of the anchoring fibrils at the dermo-epidermal junction; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotypes remain elusive. We investigated naturally occurring COL7A1 mutations and showed that some, but not all, glycine substitutions in collagen VII interfered with biosynthesis of the protein in a dominant-negative manner. Three point mutations in exon 73 caused glycine substitutions G2006D, G2034R, and G2015E in the triple helical domain of collagen VII and interfered with its folding and secretion. Confocal laser scanning studies and semiquantitative immunoblotting determined that dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa keratinocytes retained up to 2.5-fold more procollagen VII within the rough endoplasmic reticulum than controls. Limited proteolytic digestions of mutant procollagen VII produced aberrant fragments and revealed reduced stability of the triple helix. In contrast, the glycine substitution G1519D in another segment of the triple helix affected neither procollagen VII secretion nor anchoring fibril function and remained phenotypically silent. These data demonstrate that collagen VII presents a remarkable exception among collagens in that not all glycine substitutions within the triple helix exert dominant-negative interference and that the biological consequences of the substitutions probably depend on their position within the triple helix.

They represent polymers of collagen VII, a large homotrimeric protein with a central triple helix and flanking amino- and carboxyl-terminal globular domains. Epidermal keratinocytes synthesize and secrete collagen VII as a triple helical precursor (procollagen VII) into the extracellular matrix. After secretion, procollagen VII undergoes proteolytic trimming to collagen VII (3Bruckner-Tuderman L. Nilssen Ö. Zimmermann D. Dours-Zimmermann M.-T. Kalinke U.D. Gedde-Dahl Jr., T. Winberg J.-O.

However, despite a growing number of known collagen VII mutations, the biological consequences of these mutations and the pathogenic pathways from the gene defect to dermo-epidermal tissue separation in the skin have remained elusive. Glycine substitution mutations in other collagen genes underlie heritable connective tissue diseases, such as osteogenesis imperfecta, chondrodysplasias, certain subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or Alport's syndrome (for reviews, see Refs. 21Byers P.

These mutations cause pathologic phenotypes through dominant-negative interference. Therefore, the prediction was that glycine substitution mutations inCOL7A1 had similar effects. Surprisingly, however, molecular genetic analyses of a number of DEB families disclosed several compound heterozygous glycine substitution mutations in COL7A1 that did not cause a pathologic phenotype in obligate carriers (20Christiano A.M. McGrath J.A. Tan K.C. Uitto J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 671-681PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to establish genotype-phenotype relationships and to elucidate the different biological consequences in COL7A1mutations, we identified glycine substitution mutations inCOL7A1 exons 44 and 73 and investigated the biological and clinical phenotypes of the mutations. Whereas a glycine substitution mutation in exon 44 remained biologically and clinically silent, three glycine substitution mutations in exon 73 interfered with the biosynthesis and function of collagen VII in a dominant-negative manner.

His father and brother were deceased, but were reported to have had similar blistering tendency. No other family member had a skin disease or a genetic disorder.

Direct sequencing of the 286-base pair PCR product of exon 73 disclosed point mutations in all probands (Fig. 1). The affected members of family 1 were heterozygous for a 6017G→A transition (G2006D), family 2 for a 6100G→A transition (G2034R), and family 3 for a 6044G→A transition (G2015E). The sequence variations did not represent neutral polymorphisms since they were not found in healthy first-degree relatives or in 100 normal chromosomes by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Mutation G2034R was recently also identified in a Japanese epidermolysis bullosa patient (35Kon A. Nomura K. Pulkkinen L. Sawamura D. Hashimoto I. Uitto J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1997; 109: 684-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Proband 4 was heterozygous for a 4556G→A transition in exon 44 (G1519D), as described elsewhere.2 Immunofluorescence staining with antibodies to collagen VII demonstrated a weak intracellular granular staining in normal control keratinocytes (Fig. 2) that colocalized with protein-disulfide isomerase, a resident protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (data not shown). In contrast, two of the three DDEB keratinocyte strains (1-1 and 2-1) revealed a clearly increased intracellular collagen VII content as evidenced by a strong IF signal (Fig. 2 and Table I). A certain proportion of 1-1 (26König A. Raghunath M. Steinmann B. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 2-1 keratinocytes exhibited confluent intracellular granular patches. These were consistent with accumulation of collagen VII in dilated cisternae of the rough endoplasmic reticulum as evidenced by colocalization with protein-disulfide isomerase (data not shown). Use of domain-specific antibodies against the NC-1, NC-2, and triple helical domains demonstrated that the retained material consisted of procollagen VII molecules. These observations were in concert with previous investigations on proband 1-1 keratinocytes, which accumulated collagen VII in the rough endoplasmic reticulum as shown by IF and immunoelectron microscopy (26König A. Raghunath M. Steinmann B. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1994; 102: 105-110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The results of immunoblotting of keratinocyte extracts were consistent with the IF staining. A single 320-kDa band representing the pro-α1(VII) polypeptide chain was found in control and DDEB cell media and extracts, but quantitative differences emerged (Fig. 3). The procollagen VII bands derived from 2-1 and 3-1 cell extracts were stronger than controls, whereas the bands derived from the media of the cultures appeared similar. A semiquantitative immunoblot assay using water-soluble chromophores and a spectrophotometric determination of the immune signal (28König A. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) revealed a higher cell layer/medium ratio of procollagen VII in DDEB cells than in controls, indicating intracellular accumulation of procollagen VII. When the calculated cell layer/medium ratio was set at 1.0 in controls, it was 2.5 in 2-1 cells and 1.7 in 3-1 cells (Table I). In contrast to the cells of probands 1-1, 2-1, and 3-1, cultured keratinocytes of proband 4 did not retain procollagen VII, as demonstrated by IF staining and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4). Semiquantitative assessment of the immunoblot signals revealed a normal cell layer/medium ratio of procollagen VII in the keratinocyte cultures of proband 4, indicating that no intracellular accumulation occurred. The calculated cell layer/medium ratio was 1.0 in both controls and in the cells of proband 4 (Table I). To assess the stability of the mutant procollagen VII retained in the cells, the protein was extracted from control and DEB keratinocytes and probed by limited pepsin digestion or a sequential pepsin/trypsin treatment (33Bruckner P. Prockop D. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Since collagen VII is very sensitive to proteolysis (1Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a low enzyme concentration and a reaction temperature were chosen for the pepsin digestion. Under these conditions, the globular NC-1 and NC-2 domains were removed from procollagen VII. The triple helical domain mostly resisted digestion, except for a partial cleavage into the P1 and P2 fragments (Fig. 3 B) at the site of the hinge region in the center of the helical domain, as described by Burgeson (1Burgeson R.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 101: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of mutant 3-1, pepsin treatment led to a fragment pattern similar to that of controls, but mutant 2-1 yielded a double band of the C-terminal P1 fragment, reflecting decreased stability of the triple helix in mutant procollagen VII (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the cell extracts were subjected to a combined, limited pepsin/trypsin digestion (Fig. 3 C). To define conditions under which the triple helix of normal collagen VII loses its resistance to this combined proteolytic digestion, the trypsin incubations were carried out at different temperatures. In controls, the triple helical fragment lost its stability around 35 °C. Subsequently, the stability of normal and mutant collagen VII was compared at 33 °C for the trypsin digestion. No significant difference between pepsin digestion alone and the pepsin/trypsin combination was observed in controls at 33 °C,i.e. both the triple helical region and the P1 fragment were visualized on immunoblots (Fig. 3 C). In contrast, collagen VII from 2-1 cells was less stable. As shown in Fig. 3 C(lane 6), the triple helical fragment was completely digested, and the double band of the P1 fragment appeared weaker. These observations demonstrate that the triple helix of the mutant collagen VII molecules from 2-1 cells is less stable against proteolysis, suggesting that the glycine substitution causes abnormal, incomplete folding of the collagen. Cell extracts of probands 1-1 and 1-2 were not available for these analyses. The ultrastructure of anchoring fibrils in DDEB skin was altered. Electron microscopic examination of the dermo-epidermal basement membrane zone in 1-1 and 3-1 skin (Fig. 5) showed a reduced number of anchoring fibrils as compared with normal control skin (Fig. 5 a). In 1-1, patches of some normal appearing and some slender, narrow anchoring fibrils along the dermo-epidermal junction were observed (Fig. 5 b), but long stretches of the basement membrane zone were devoid of fibrils. In 3-1, only rudimentary fibril-like structures could be discerned (Fig. 5 c). Since early studies on folding of fibrillar collagens with long uninterrupted triple helices, i.e. collagens I–III, had shown that the presence of a glycine in every third amino acid position in the polypeptide is a prerequisite for formation and secretion of a stable triple helix (for review, see Ref. 23Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), it has been generally assumed that glycine substitutions prevent adequate folding of all collagens by dominant-negative interference. We now demonstrate that collagen VII presents an exception to this rule in that not all glycine substitutions lead to abnormal folding of the molecule. We show that naturally occurring glycine substitutions in the segment encoded by exon 73, but not by exon 44, of COL7A1 interfere with secretion of procollagen VII by keratinocytes in vitro and affect the function of the anchoring fibrils in the skin. Since all four mutations in this study led to substitution of a Gly residue by a larger amino acid, the initial prediction was that procollagen VII molecules containing one, two, or three mutant pro-α1(VII) polypeptide chains undergo slow and/or inadequate triple helix folding, delayed secretion, intracellular accumulation, and degradation. This phenomenon, coined “protein suicide” (23Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar), has been shown to apply to disorders of collagen genes includingCOL1A1, COL1A2, COL2A1, andCOL3A1 (21Byers P. Royce P.M Steinmann B. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, New York1993: 317-350Google Scholar, 22Steinmann B. Royce P.M. Superti-Furga A. Royce P.M. Steinmann B.

In the case of a homotrimeric collagen, with equal amounts of the normal and mutant chains synthesized, seven-eighths of the trimeric molecules contain at least one mutant pro-α-chain, and only one-eighth consists solely of normal polypeptides. The normal molecules, and presumably some mutant ones, are secreted into the extracellular matrix. Protein suicide can be regarded as a protective mechanism since incorporation of abnormally folded molecules into fibrillar polymers destabilizes the suprastructures and renders them ultrastructurally abnormal and functionally inadequate. The present findings with collagen VII mutants G2006D, G2034R, and G2015E on intracellular accumulation of procollagen VII and secretion of only a fraction of the molecules are consistent with the above hypothesis. They also explain the ultrastructural observations of a reduced number and abnormal appearance of anchoring fibrils in the probands' skin (Fig. 5). In concurrence, a quantitative ultrastructural study showed that, in DDEB skin, the number of anchoring fibrils was reduced to 0–30% of normal (37Tidman M.J. Eady R.A.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1985; 88: 448-453Google Scholar). In view of the above considerations, the finding that glycine substitution G1519D did not interfere with folding and secretion of procollagen VII was unexpected. The evaluation of procollagen VII synthesis and secretion in keratinocytes of proband 4 was comparable to that of controls, an observation consistent with the lack of a clinical phenotype in the proband. The mutation obviously causes pathologic consequences only in combination with another gene defect, as exemplified by the daughter of proband 4. The child was compound heterozygous for G1519D and a second maternal glycine substitution and presented with skin blistering at birth.2 Clinical and genetic evidence of “silent” glycine substitution mutations inCOL7A1 has been found in some DEB families, but no biochemical studies on these have been reported. Such mutations include G1782R, G2749R, G2569R, G2653R, and G2674R (20Christiano A.M. McGrath J.A. Tan K.C. Uitto J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 671-681PubMed Google Scholar); G2575R (15Shimizu H.

The reasons why these glycine substitutions remain clinically silent when combined with a normal allelic product remain unclear at present. One reason may be the location of the substituted glycine within the collagen VII molecule and the degree of abnormal folding it causes. The exon 73 mutations described here cause glycine substitutions in close vicinity of the non-collagenous hinge region in the center of the long triple helix (Fig. 6). The segment encoded by the exon contains amino acid residues 1994–2060 as part of a 35-triplet stretch of -Gly-X-Y- that is flanked by non-collagenous sequences of 39 and 6 amino acid residues in length (Fig. 6). In the middle of the 35 triplets, an imperfection in the form of an additional single leucine residue occurs. The mutated glycine residues within the 35-triplet segment are evolutionarily highly conserved in human, mouse, and hamster (41Greenspan D.S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Kivirikko S. Li K. Christiano A.M. Uitto J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 1300-1306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggesting the functional importance of these amino acids. Substitution of such glycine residues in this short, imperfectly collagenous segment may lead to a greater destabilization than glycine substitutions within a long uninterrupted collagenous segment or close to the N or C terminus. Most silent substitutions are located close to either the N- or C-terminal ends of the triple helix or in the middle of long uninterrupted segments of -Gly-X-Y- repeats, like the G1519G substitution investigated here. Gly-1519 is located within a long uninterrupted stretch of the collagen VII triple helix, within the P2 fragment (Fig. 6). These long helix stretches may be more stable than the segment encoded by exon 73 next to the hinge region, and the substitution of one glycine may not abolish the function of the molecule. Among other collagen genes, a silent glycine substitution mutation has been identified in the COL11A2 gene encoding the α2-chain of collagen XI (43Vikkula M. Mariman E.C.M. Lui V.C.H. Zhidkova N.I. Tiller G.E. Goldring M.B. van Beersum S.E.C. de Waal Malefijt M.C. van den Hoogen F.H.J. Ropers H.-H. Mayne R. Cheah K.S.E. Olsen B.R. Warman M.L. Brunner H.G. Cell. 1995; 80: 431-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In recessive osteochondrodysplasia, a substitution of arginine for glycine in the α2(XI)-chain caused a severe phenotype in homozygous individuals, but remained silent in heterozygous carriers. Although no protein chemical or other phenotypic studies were performed, the prediction was that the position of the glycine substitution within the collagen XI triple helix was important. The silent glycine substitution was localized close to the amino terminus of the molecule and may have allowed incorporation of mutated molecules into collagen fibrils and permitted some residual function. Like collagen VII, collagen XI is not a classical fibrillar collagen consisting of uninterrupted -Gly-X-Y- repeat sequences, but has an interrupted triple helix and globular domains. Therefore, the rules found for the effects of glycine substitutions in fibrillar collagens may not apply without exception to other collagen types, and it is likely that further examples of mutations causing unanticipated biological and clinical phenotypes will be found when new defects in other collagen genes are disclosed.

While an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK is recognized as an early event in the action of multiple agents, much less is known about the regulation of the tyrosine kinase activity of FAK in response to extracellular stimuli. Integrin engagement with fibronectin and v-Src transformation have been shown to increase FAK-associated tyrosine kinase activity in immunoprecipitates (33Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 36Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 905-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies, however, showed that these conditions also promote the formation of a complex between autophosphorylated FAK at Tyr-397 and the SH2 domain of Src (48Xing Z. Chen H.C. Nowlen J.K.

Consequently, it is not clear whether the increase in the kinase activity of FAK immune complexes is mediated by FAK or by co-immunoprecipitating Src. Furthermore, the effect of neuropeptide agonists or bioactive lipids on FAK-associated tyrosine kinase activity has not been examined. In the present study we demonstrate that stimulation of Swiss 3T3 cells with bombesin, vasopressin, LPA, and SPC induces a rapid increase in FAK-associated tyrosine kinase activity. Our results show that this increase in FAK activity can be dissociated from the presence of Src kinase members in the FAK immunoprecipitates. Bombesin induces FAK activation through a PKC- and Ca2+-independent pathway that requires the integrity of the actin filament network. Stock cultures of Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air at 37 °C. For experimental purposes, Swiss 3T3 cells were plated in 35-mm Nunc Petri dishes at 105 cells/dish in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and used after 6–8 days when the cells were confluent and quiescent (14Rozengurt E. Sinnett-Smith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2936-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells (1–2 × 106 cells) were washed twice with DMEM, equilibrated in the same medium at 37 °C for at least 15 min, and then treated with peptide factors in 1 ml of DMEM for the times indicated. The stimulation was terminated by aspirating the medium and solubilizing the cells in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.35, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min and the pellets were discarded. After centrifugation, supernatants were transferred to fresh tubes and proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 3 h with either protein A-agarose linked polyclonal anti-FAK (C-20) or polyclonal anti-Src family (SRC-2) antibodies or with protein G-agarose linked mAb directed against FAK (mAb 2A7) as described previously (18Zachary I.

Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, extracted in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol), by boiling 5 min, fractionated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, and further analyzed as described under “Results” and in the figure legends. Immunoprecipitates obtained with C-20, 2A7, or SRC-2 were also used for in vitro kinase reactions. FAK immunoprecipitates were washed and pelleted (2,500 rpm for 10 min in the cold) 3 times in lysis buffer. When C-20 polyclonal antibody was used, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with FAK kinase buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 3 mm MnCl2). Pellets were dissolved in 40 μl of kinase buffer and reactions were started by adding 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 15 min, and stopped on ice by adding 10 mm EDTA. In some experiments poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) (40 μg) was added to the C-20 immunocomplex. The incorporation of 32P label into poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) was stopped by removing the supernatant from the agarose beads and adding 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. When mAb 2A7 was used, immunoprecipitates were washed twice with FAK kinase buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.01% Brij-35, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, 150 mm NaCl). These immunoprecipitates were then dissolved in 40 μl of kinase buffer and reactions were started by adding 20 μl of ATP mixture composed of 30 mmMgCl2, 30 μm cold ATP, pH 7.0, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 40 min, and were stopped on ice by adding 10 mm EDTA. After the in vitro kinase reactions the pellet was washed twice in lysis buffer containing 5 mmEDTA, extracted for 5 min at 95 °C in 2 × SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After fixing and drying of the gels, autoradiography was performed at −80 °C. Autoradiograms were scanned using an LKB Ultrascan XL densitometer and labeled bands were quantified using the Ultrascan XL internal integrator. Phosphorylation of the highly specific Src peptide,p-Ala-Glu-Glu-Glu-Ile-Tyr-Gly-Glu-Phe-Glu-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys-Lys-NH2(56Zhou S. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), and RaytideTM substrate were performed as follows. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer as above and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Brij) and resuspended in 20 μl of this buffer. Kinase reactions were initiated by the addition of 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, in the presence of 100 μmSrc peptide or RaytideTM substrate, in a total volume of 30 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 5 min (Src peptide) or 30 min (RaytideTM substrate), peptide phosphorylation was stopped by the addition of 120 μl of 10% phosphoric acid, and the reaction mixture was then applied onto P-81 ion exchange chromatography paper. Papers were washed five times in 0.5% phosphoric acid, once with acetone, dried, and counted in a scintillation counter. Treatment of quiescent cultures of cells with factors, cell lysis, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described above. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to Immobilon membranes for 2 h at 400 mAmp in transfer buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris base, 0.075% SDS, 0.6 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20% methanol). After transfer, membranes were blocked using 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and incubated for 2 h at 22 °C either with the anti-FAK mAb from Transduction Laboratories, or with the polyclonal anti-FAK C-20 antibody, both diluted 1:500 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk. After incubating membranes with secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies to rabbit or mouse immunoglobulin), immunoreactive bands were visualized using ECL reagents. This analysis was carried according to Ref. 57Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar. Bombesin, vasopressin, SPC, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), cytochalasin D, poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1),o-phospho-dl-threonine,o-phospho-dl-tyrosine,o-phospho-dl-serine, agarose-linked anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Sigma and [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) and ECL reagents were from Amersham (Buckinghamshire, UK). Protein A-agarose and protein G-agarose were from Boehringer Mannheim. The highly specific Src peptide substrate was synthesized at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund. RaytideTM was from Oncogene Science, Inc. The PKC inhibitor GF109203X, the Src inhibitor PP-1, and thapsigargin were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd., Nottingham, United Kingdom. The 2A7 mAb anti-FAK was from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY. FAK anti-peptide polyclonal antibody C-20 and Src-family affinity-purified anti-peptide polyclonal antibody (SRC-2) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Anti-FAK mAb used in Western blotting was from Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY. All other reagents used were of the purest grade available. To examine the effect of bombesin on FAK-associated tyrosine kinase activity, quiescent cultures of Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with or without 10 nm bombesin for 2.5 min and lysed. The lysates were incubated with the 2A7 mAb, which recognizes the C-terminal sequence of FAK (58Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The resulting immune complexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 1 A (2A7, upper) bombesin induced an increase in the phosphorylation of a 125-kDa band that exactly co-migrated with immunoreactive FAK. In order to confirm that the radiolabeled 125-kDa band was FAK, the phosphorylated band was eluted by denaturation and incubated with a different anti-FAK mAb that recognizes an epitope in the kinase domain of FAK (corresponding to amino acids 354–533 of the chicken protein). The re-immunoprecipitation of the 125-kDa radiolabeled band (Fig. 1 A, a-FAK) confirmed that it is phosphorylated FAK. Immunoblotting with anti-FAK mAb of anti-FAK immunoprecipitates prepared in parallel with those used for the assays of kinase activity verified that similar amounts of FAK were recovered after bombesin treatment (Fig. 1 A, ip:2A7; wb:a-FAK). An increase in FAK phosphorylation following in vitro kinase assays was also obtained when lysates of Swiss cells stimulated with bombesin were immunoprecipitated with C-20, a polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1033–1052 mapping at the carboxyl terminus of human FAK (Fig. 1 A,C-20, upper). Densitometric scanning showed that bombesin induced a 2.5 ± 0.5-fold (n = 15) and 2.3 ± 0.5-fold (n = 9) increase in the phosphorylation of FAK in immunoprecipitates obtained with 2A7 mAb and C-20 polyclonal antibody, respectively (Fig. 1 A, lower panels). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the phosphorylated FAK band obtained after the in vitro kinase reaction showed that only tyrosine residues were phosphorylated (Fig. 1 B). An increase in the activity of FAK-associated kinase after bombesin treatment of intact Swiss 3T3 cells was also demonstrated when lysates of quiescent and bombesin-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with 2A7 mAb and kinase activity was determined by the ability of the immunoprecipitates to phosphorylate exogenously added substrates, including RaytideTM (4.3-fold stimulation, Fig. 1 C), or poly(Glu-Tyr) (4:1) (not shown). In all cases, no kinase activity was detected when the lysates were immunoprecipitated with non-immune serum (results not shown). An increase in FAK-associated tyrosine kinase in anti-FAK immunoprecipitates was a rapid consequence of the addition of bombesin to intact Swiss 3T3 cells, reaching a maximum between 1 and 2.5 min of incubation (Fig. 2 A). Immunoblotting with anti-FAK mAb of anti-FAK immunoprecipitates prepared in parallel with those used for the assays of kinase activity verified that similar amounts of FAK were recovered after different times of bombesin treatment (Fig. 2 A). Bombesin induced FAK phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner reaching half-maximum and maximum effects at 0.05 and 1 nm, respectively (Fig. 2 B). To examine whether activation of other G-protein coupled receptors also increases FAK-associated tyrosine kinase activity, Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated with 20 nm vasopressin, 2 μm LPA, or 5 μm SPC for various times. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), vasopressin and LPA induced a rapid and sustained increase in the phosphorylation of FAK which reached a maximum 2 min after agonist stimulation. SPC also induced a very rapid increase in FAK-associated kinase activity, but it was transient rather than sustained (Fig. 3 C). Western blotting with anti-FAK mAb of anti-FAK immunoprecipitates, carried out in parallel with those used for the assays of in vitro kinase activity, confirmed that similar amounts of FAK protein were recovered after vasopressin, LPA, and SPC treatment (Fig. 3). Autophosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 either in v-Src transformed cells or in cells replated on fibronectin, creates a binding site for the SH2 domain of members of the Src family that leads to the formation of a signaling complex in which Src kinases are active (48Xing Z.

Consequently, the increase in tyrosine kinase activity measured in FAK immunocomplexes under these conditions could be due to co-immunoprecipitating Src rather than to FAK. Similarly, the increase in FAK-associated tyrosine kinase activity induced by bombesin and other agonists shown in the present study could be mediated by co-precipitating Src kinases rather than to FAK activation and autophosphorylation. Here, we provide several lines of evidence indicating that bombesin and other agonists induce FAK activation in Swiss 3T3 cells. We found that lysis of Swiss 3T3 cells in a buffer solution containing 1% Triton (the composition of the lysis buffer is given under “Experimental Procedures”) rather than in modified RIPA buffer greatly diminished complex formation between FAK and Src family members, as judged by Western blot analysis with anti-FAK C-20 antibody of Src immunoprecipitates (results not shown). To examine further whether Src family members were present in FAK immunocomplexes under our experimental conditions, Triton lysates from control and bombesin-stimulated Swiss 3T3 cells were immunoprecipitated with the 2A7 mAb and the immunocomplexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and the synthetic peptide AEEEIYGEFEAKKKK, which has been identified as a Src optimal peptide substrate (56Zhou S. Carraway 3rd, K.L. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Feldman R.A. Mohammadi M. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Smith D.P. Eng C. Lorenzo M.J. Ponder B.A. Mayer B.J. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, Src kinase activity was not detected in these FAK immunoprecipitates. In contrast, AEEEIYGEFEAKKKK phosphorylation was readily observed when the polyclonal anti-Src antibody SRC-2 was used to immunoprecipitate Src family members from lysates of parallel cell cultures treated with or without bombesin (Fig. 4 A, right panel). The increase in Src kinase activity induced by treatment with bombesin is in agreement with our recent results (55Rodrı́guez-Fernández J.L. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27895-27901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In order to verify that the increase in FAK activity in the in vitro kinase assays was not mediated by the presence of Src family members in the immunoprecipitates, we examined the effect of the pyrazolopyrimidine PP-1, a novel inhibitor of the Src kinase family members (59Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Lysates of Swiss 3T3 cells treated with 10 nmbombesin were incubated with either C-20 or SRC-2 to immunoprecipitate FAK and Src family members, respectively. Then, the immune complexes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP with either the Src optimal peptide substrate or Raytide in the absence or in the presence of 1 μm PP-1, a concentration previously shown to inhibit Src kinase activity (59Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Addition of PP-1 caused a marked inhibition of Src kinase activity (Fig. 4 B). In striking contrast, PP-1 had only a slight effect on FAK kinase activity, as measured by the phosphorylation of Raytide (Fig. 4 C). To substantiate the differential inhibition of Src and FAK by PP-1 presented in Fig. 4, we examined the effect of increasing concentrations of this compound on the autophosphorylation of FAK and Src. As shown in Fig. 5 A, addition of PP-1 caused a marked inhibition of immunoprecipitated Src autokinase"
https://openalex.org/W2008202443,"Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by the expansion of a glutamine repeat in the protein huntingtin. The expanded glutamine repeat is thought to mediate a gain of function by causing huntingtin to abnormally interact with other proteins. We previously identified a rat huntingtin-associated protein (HAP1) that binds to huntingtin; HAP1 binds more tightly to huntingtin with an expanded glutamine repeat than to wild type huntingtin. Identification of the human homologue of HAP1 is necessary for investigation of the potential role of HAP1 in HD pathology. Here, we report the cloning of a human HAP1 homologue (hHAP) that shares 62% identity with rat HAP1 over its entire sequence and 82% amino acid identity in the putative huntingtin-binding region. The hHAP gene encodes a 4.1-kilobase transcript and a 75-kDa protein which are specifically expressed in human brain tissues. Its expression in Huntington's disease brains is reduced in parallel with a decreased expression of huntingtin. While two isoforms of rat HAP1 are expressed at similar levels in rat brain, only a single major form of hHAP is found in primate brains. In vitro binding, immunoprecipitation, and coexpression studies confirm the interaction of hHAP with huntingtin. The in vitro binding of hHAP to huntingtin is enhanced by lengthening the glutamine repeat. Despite similar binding properties of rat HAP1 and hHAP, differences in the sequences and expression of hHAP may contribute to a specific role for its interaction with huntingtin in humans.

Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 2205-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) which participates in dynein-mediated retrograde transport. It remains to be shown whether human brain also contains a HAP1 homologue with similar binding properties. Since mice with normal levels of mutant huntingtin do not display any abnormal phenotype (8White J.K. Auerbach W. Duyao M.P. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Joyner A.L. MacDonald M.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), specific properties of the proteins which associate with human huntingtin may account for the HD phenotype that occurs in man. Therefore, it will be interesting to identify human proteins that associate with huntingtin.In this study, we isolated a human HAP1 homologue (hHAP) by molecular cloning. hHAP shares 62% amino acid identity with rat HAP1-A. Although its binding to huntingtin is comparable to that of rat HAP1, hHAP only has a single major form expressed in primate brains, in contrast to two isoforms of HAP1 in rat brain. The different sequences and expression of hHAP could contribute to a specific role in the interaction of hHAP and huntingtin in human brain. Identification of the human HAP1 homologue will facilitate the study of the relevance of the interaction between HAP1 and huntingtin in the pathology of HD.DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence in the present study demonstrate that hHAP is a human counterpart of rat HAP1. First, the sequence of hHAP shows a high degree of homology to that of rat HAP1. Second, like rat HAP1 (15Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 20Li X.J. Sharp A.H. Li S.H. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4839-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), primate HAP1 is enriched in monkey and human brains. In addition, hHAP appears to be expressed with huntingtin in the neurons that are vulnerable in HD. Third, in vitro binding, immunoprecipitation, and coexpression studies consistently show that hHAP specifically interacts with huntingtin, and its in vitro binding seems to be enhanced by an expanded glutamine repeat. Rat HAP1 has been also found to bind more tightly to huntingtin (15Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 24Li S.-H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.-J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of hHAP and rat HAP1 in their sequences and binding to huntingtin suggests that hHAP and rat HAP1 bind to huntingtin in the same manner.There are also differences between hHAP and rat HAP1. The amino acid sequences of hHAP display a number of insertions or deletions when compared with the sequences of rat HAP1. Unlike huntingtin which is highly conserved between humans and rodents (91% amino acid identity), hHAP and rat HAP1 share 62% amino acid identity overall. However, amino acids in the huntingtin-binding regions of both proteins are well conserved (82% identity), suggesting that their binding properties are similar while other functional aspects may not be identical. In addition, unlike rat HAP1 which is expressed as two isoforms (HAP1-A and HAP1-B), hHAP only displays a single major form in primate brains. The expression pattern of hHAP in transfected cells is also different from that of rat HAP1-A. These differences may reflect unique properties of hHAP that could confer a specific role of the interaction of HAP1 and huntingtin in human brain.Several hHAP cDNA variants were found during cDNA screening. Most of them have insertions or deletions after the putative huntingtin-binding region. This may explain why no one has succeeded in isolating hHAP using yeast two-hybrid screening. However, the hHAP amino acid sequence presented in Fig. 1 is likely to represent the major protein product of the hHAP gene. This is because the cDNA probe and the antibody to the middle region of cloned hHAP consistently detect a major band on Northern and Western blots, respectively. Also, the mass of transfected hHAP is the same as that of native hHAP on Western blots. Several other weak bands are also seen. These weak bands could represent alternatively spliced products or other homologues of hHAP. Whether other hHAP cDNA variants are also expressed remains to be studied using antibodies specifically to their encoding amino acids.Identification of hHAP further suggests a potential role of HAP1 in the pathology of HD. First, the parallel reduction in the expression of huntingtin and hHAP in the HD brains suggests that both proteins are expressed in the same neurons that are vulnerable in HD. However, the expression of hHAP is not restricted to the brain regions that can be affected in HD. The selective neurodegeneration in HD may also be associated with heterogeneous expression of huntingtin in the striatum (32Ferrante R.J. Gutekunst C.A. Persichetti F. McNeil S.M. Kowall N.W. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Beal M.F. Hersch S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3052-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or other specific neuronal factors. Second, like rat HAP1, hHAP binds to the N-terminal region of huntingtin in vitro. Proteins that bind to the N-terminal region of huntingtin are especially interesting because the N-terminal fragment of huntingtin (amino acids 1–67) with an additional 150 glutamines has been found to cause neurological disorders in transgenic mice (31Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P.

Mangiarini L. Bates G.P. Cell. 1997; 90: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1889) Google Scholar). We observed that the binding of the N-terminal huntingtin (amino acids 1–230) with the glutamine repeat (23Q, 44Q, or 73Q) to GST-hHAP is increased by lengthening the repeat. Although the increase is not dramatic in vitro, it could contribute to cumulative effects of huntingtin mutation or late onset of pathophysiology if it also occurs in vivo. The interaction of hHAP and huntingtin is also supported by their co-localization in hHAP immunoreactive inclusions in transfected cells. Their co-localization is specific because DRPLA, another glutamine repeat protein, does not co-localize with hHAP on these distinct structures. Rat HAP1 has been found to associate with similar cytoplasmic structures in the rat brain. 2C. A. Gutekunst, S-H. Li, X-J. Li, and S. M. Hersch, unpublished observations. Whether human brain also contains hHAP immunoreactive cytoplasmic inclusions remains to be studied.Unique components or specific properties of human huntingtin complexes may account for the neuropathology of HD in man. This is suggested by recent findings that transgenic mice expressing mutant human huntingtin do not display the graded loss of neurons in brain (8White J.K. Auerbach W. Duyao M.P. Vonsattel J.P.

It remains to be shown whether human brain also contains a HAP1 homologue with similar binding properties. Since mice with normal levels of mutant huntingtin do not display any abnormal phenotype (8White J.K. Auerbach W. Duyao M.P. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Joyner A.L. MacDonald M.E. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), specific properties of the proteins which associate with human huntingtin may account for the HD phenotype that occurs in man. Therefore, it will be interesting to identify human proteins that associate with huntingtin. In this study, we isolated a human HAP1 homologue (hHAP) by molecular cloning. hHAP shares 62% amino acid identity with rat HAP1-A. Although its binding to huntingtin is comparable to that of rat HAP1, hHAP only has a single major form expressed in primate brains, in contrast to two isoforms of HAP1 in rat brain. The different sequences and expression of hHAP could contribute to a specific role in the interaction of hHAP and huntingtin in human brain. Identification of the human HAP1 homologue will facilitate the study of the relevance of the interaction between HAP1 and huntingtin in the pathology of HD. DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence in the present study demonstrate that hHAP is a human counterpart of rat HAP1. First, the sequence of hHAP shows a high degree of homology to that of rat HAP1. Second, like rat HAP1 (15Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A.

A. 1996; 93: 4839-4844Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), primate HAP1 is enriched in monkey and human brains. In addition, hHAP appears to be expressed with huntingtin in the neurons that are vulnerable in HD. Third, in vitro binding, immunoprecipitation, and coexpression studies consistently show that hHAP specifically interacts with huntingtin, and its in vitro binding seems to be enhanced by an expanded glutamine repeat. Rat HAP1 has been also found to bind more tightly to huntingtin (15Li X.J. Li S.H. Sharp A.H. Nucifora Jr., F.C. Schilling G. Lanahan A. Worley P. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 398-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 24Li S.-H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.-J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The similarity of hHAP and rat HAP1 in their sequences and binding to huntingtin suggests that hHAP and rat HAP1 bind to huntingtin in the same manner.There are also differences between hHAP and rat HAP1. The amino acid sequences of hHAP display a number of insertions or deletions when compared with the sequences of rat HAP1. Unlike huntingtin which is highly conserved between humans and rodents (91% amino acid identity), hHAP and rat HAP1 share 62% amino acid identity overall. However, amino acids in the huntingtin-binding regions of both proteins are well conserved (82% identity), suggesting that their binding properties are similar while other functional aspects may not be identical. In addition, unlike rat HAP1 which is expressed as two isoforms (HAP1-A and HAP1-B), hHAP only displays a single major form in primate brains. The expression pattern of hHAP in transfected cells is also different from that of rat HAP1-A. These differences may reflect unique properties of hHAP that could confer a specific role of the interaction of HAP1 and huntingtin in human brain.Several hHAP cDNA variants were found during cDNA screening. Most of them have insertions or deletions after the putative huntingtin-binding region. This may explain why no one has succeeded in isolating hHAP using yeast two-hybrid screening. However, the hHAP amino acid sequence presented in Fig. 1 is likely to represent the major protein product of the hHAP gene. This is because the cDNA probe and the antibody to the middle region of cloned hHAP consistently detect a major band on Northern and Western blots, respectively. Also, the mass of transfected hHAP is the same as that of native hHAP on Western blots. Several other weak bands are also seen. These weak bands could represent alternatively spliced products or other homologues of hHAP. Whether other hHAP cDNA variants are also expressed remains to be studied using antibodies specifically to their encoding amino acids.Identification of hHAP further suggests a potential role of HAP1 in the pathology of HD. First, the parallel reduction in the expression of huntingtin and hHAP in the HD brains suggests that both proteins are expressed in the same neurons that are vulnerable in HD. However, the expression of hHAP is not restricted to the brain regions that can be affected in HD. The selective neurodegeneration in HD may also be associated with heterogeneous expression of huntingtin in the striatum (32Ferrante R.J. Gutekunst C.A. Persichetti F. McNeil S.M. Kowall N.W. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Beal M.F. Hersch S.M. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3052-3063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or other specific neuronal factors. Second, like rat HAP1, hHAP binds to the N-terminal region of huntingtin in vitro. Proteins that bind to the N-terminal region of huntingtin are especially interesting because the N-terminal fragment of huntingtin (amino acids 1–67) with an additional 150 glutamines has been found to cause neurological disorders in transgenic mice (31Mangiarini L.

We observed that the binding of the N-terminal huntingtin (amino acids 1–230) with the glutamine repeat (23Q, 44Q, or 73Q) to GST-hHAP is increased by lengthening the repeat. Although the increase is not dramatic in vitro, it could contribute to cumulative effects of huntingtin mutation or late onset of pathophysiology if it also occurs in vivo. The interaction of hHAP and huntingtin is also supported by their co-localization in hHAP immunoreactive inclusions in transfected cells. Their co-localization is specific because DRPLA, another glutamine repeat protein, does not co-localize with hHAP on these distinct structures. Rat HAP1 has been found to associate with similar cytoplasmic structures in the rat brain. 2C. A. Gutekunst, S-H. Li, X-J. Li, and S. M. Hersch, unpublished observations.

https://openalex.org/W1976453734,This article discusses Thailands proactive and committed efforts to slow the spread of AIDS and HIV infections. Thailand established HIV/AIDS strategies and policies based on research and evaluation. Government made a commitment to financing and implementation. The spread of HIV/AIDS slowed but about 1 million became infected. The Thai government altered strategies and policy as knowledge of the extent of risk behavior grew and the social economic and cultural roots of the epidemic were revealed. Programs expanded beyond the public health sector to socioeconomic sectors. Equal partnerships were formed between private businesses nongovernmental and community organizations. By 1996 the Thai government supported 91% of AIDS program efforts. Research studies were initiated in 1989. In 1991 all government sponsored sexually transmitted disease clinics promoted condom use in the commercial sex trade. There was encouragement among commercial sex owners sex workers and clients to use condoms. AIDS education was incorporated into school curricula in 1990. AIDS education evolved to include life skills empowerment. Early studies alerted the government to increased HIV infections among the Royal Thai Armys new young recruits and pregnant women. During 1990-97 declines occurred in exposure to sex workers and extramarital sex. There is evidence of change in sex behavior among at-risk groups. The prevalence of HIV is still high despite declining trends. The crisis will be exacerbated by financial crises increased immigration from neighboring countries and reduced AIDS budgets.

The Tax response elements (TxREs) of the long terminal repeat resemble cAMP response elements (CREs), the target of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). CREB binds the TxRE with reduced affinity; however, the interaction is specifically enhanced by Tax. Using a fluorescence quenching method, we determined that CREB dimerizes in the absence of DNA, and that Tax does not enhance dimerization. DNA footprinting of the TxRE with 1,10-phenanthroline-copper complex demonstrates that Tax contacts DNA and extends the footprint of CREB to GC-rich sequences flanking the core CRE-like element. The minor groove-binding drug chromomycin A3, but not distamycin A, disrupted Tax-enhanced CREB binding to the TxRE. Substitution of the guanine-rich sequences flanking the core of the TxRE with inosine residues also blocked the Tax effect. Finally, the IC-substituted TxRE binds CREB with increased affinity, suggesting flanking DNA influences the binding of CREB to the core CRE-like element. These data indicate that Tax does not regulate DNA binding of CREB by altering dimerization, but rather enhances DNA binding by additionally interacting with the minor groove of flanking DNA sequences.

Dittmer J. Reid R.L. Brady J.N. Human Retroviruses. IRL Press, New York1993: 159-192Google Scholar). Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma develops only in a small percentage of patients, typically many years following infection with HTLV-1. The virus remains in a state of latency in infected T-cells, producing low levels of transcripts from the long terminal repeat (LTR). Activation of viral RNA synthesis depends on cooperation between virally encoded proteins and cellular factors. The pX region of the HTLV-1 genome encodes Tax, a 40-kDa protein that is essential for viral pathogenesis. Tax is a positive transcriptional activator of both cellular and viral promoters, but Tax is thought to activate transcription through interactions with cellular proteins rather than by binding to DNA itself (2Giam C.-Z.

We and others have shown that Tax augmentation of CREB DNA binding activity is sequence-specific; Tax enhances binding of CREB (and cAMP-responsive element modulator, or CREM) to the TxRE but not to the perfect palindromic CRE derived from the somatostatin promoter (12Paca-Uccaralertkun S.

In addition Tax forms a stable complex with CREB and DNA, also in a sequence-specific manner, dependent on flanking GC-rich DNA motifs (12Paca-Uccaralertkun S. Zhao L.-J. Adya N. Cross J.V.

Although Tax does not associate with CREB bound to the somatostatin CRE, it will bind to CREB in the absence of DNA (22Goren I. Semmes O. Jeang K.-T. Moelling K. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 5806-5811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Adya N. Giam C.-Z. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1834-1841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Adya N. Zhao L.J. Wan H. Boros I. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl.

The stable complex of Tax, CREB, and the TxRE is termed the “ternary complex,” although the precise stoichiometry is unknown. This DNA-directed ternary complex recruits the CREB coactivator CREB-binding protein in a phosphorylation-independent manner, probably through a direct association with CREB-bound Tax (19Kwok R.P. Laurance M.E. Lundblad J.R. Goldman P.S. Shih H. Connor L.M. Marriott S.J. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1996; 380: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar,21Laurance M.E. Kwok R.P.S. Huang M.S.

Thus, through the activity of Tax, the TxRE DNA directs the assembly of a topologically distinct activator-coactivator complex at the HTLV-1 LTR promoter, permitting transcriptional activation through CREB in a cAMP-independent manner. The proposed molecular mechanisms of Tax-enhanced binding of CREB to DNA and ternary complex formation are controversial. Wagner and Green (26Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar) have proposed that Tax augments the dimerization of CREB as well as other B/ZIP factors. Although Tax interacts specifically with the basic region of B/ZIP proteins (18Bantignies F. Rousset R. Desbois C. Jalinot P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2174-2182Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Adya N. Zhao L.J. Wan H. Boros I. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the contribution of Tax to dimerization, mediated by the leucine zipper motif, is unclear. Tax increases the DNA binding of chimeric peptides consisting of the GCN4 basic region and unrelated dimerization motifs (27Perini G. Wagner S. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and, in the context of CREB, specific residues within the leucine zipper may be essential for the Tax effect on DNA binding (17Yin M.-J. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3156-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Yin M.-J. Paulssen E. Seeler J.-S. Gaynor R.B. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3420-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, by using nonspecific cross-linking, Wagner and Green (26Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), and Perini et al. (27Perini G. Wagner S. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), suggest that Tax increases dimeric association of the GCN4 B/ZIP through interactions with the basic segment. The DNA sequence specificity of the Tax effect, however, argues against the idea that enhanced dimerization accounts for the increased DNA binding activity. Indeed, the ability of Tax to stimulate the DNA binding activity of cross-linked basic region peptides independently of dimerization (15Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm M.K. Giebler H.A. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) suggests that Tax might associate with specific DNA sequences, despite the lack of evidence to date for direct Tax-DNA interactions (12Paca-Uccaralertkun S. Zhao L.-J. Adya N. Cross J.V. Cullen B.R. Boros I.M. Giam C.-Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 456-462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In this report, we directly measure CREB dimerization by using a solution-binding assay based on fluorescence quenching and demonstrate that Tax does not affect this aspect of CREB function. By DNA footprinting with 1,10-phenanthroline-copper complex, a minor groove-selective cleavage reagent, we demonstrate that Tax interacts with the minor groove of the DNA flanking the core CRE-like motif of the TxRE, in the context of the CREB-Tax-DNA ternary complex. The GC-selective minor groove-binding drug chromomycin A3selectively disrupts the Tax effect on CREB recruitment. Furthermore, alteration of minor groove structure by substitution of GC with IC base pairs in the flanking region disrupts Tax-enhanced DNA binding by CREB. These findings support a model of Tax acting through minor groove DNA contacts, specifically increasing the association of CREB with the HTLV-1 LTR TxRE. The bacterial expression vector for HTLV-1 Tax has been described previously (28Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding a single cysteine form of CREB327 was prepared by site directed mutagenesis of cysteines at codons 286 and 323 to serines using the Altered Sites system (Promega) (29Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Wild type CREB327 and the single cysteine mutant of CREB327 (cysteine → serine 286, cysteine 296, cysteine → serine 323) were each subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET11d as a NcoI-BamHI fragment (Novagen) and expressed as full-length proteins without polyhistidine tags inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) by identical procedures. Sequences were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). E. coli BL21(DE3) cells harboring the CREB expression vectors were grown as described previously (29Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested after 3 h at 37 °C, washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT (TED) and lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i. (Aminco). Lysates were cleared of insoluble cellular debris by centrifugation at 30,000 ×g for 30 min. The lysate was then heated to 70 °C for 15 min, and recentrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Nucleic acid was precipitated from the supernatant by addition 0.2% polyethyleneimine following adjustment of the supernatant to 0.3m NaCl. CREB was then precipitated from the supernatant with 20% (w/v) ammonium sulfate. Pellets were solubilized in TED and dialyzed, and then soluble protein was applied to a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were then eluted with a continuous concentration gradient from 0 to 1 m NaCl in TED. Fractions containing CREB were then adjusted to 2 mNaCl and applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column, washed, and eluted with low salt. Fractions containing CREB were pooled and fractionated by heparin-agarose chromatography. CREB was dialyzed into TED+100 mm NaCl and 5% glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. CREB protein concentrations were determined as described previously (31Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). HTLV1 Tax expressed as a C-terminally histidine-tagged protein inE. coli HB101 was prepared essentially as described previously (28Zhao L.-J. Giam C.-Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11445-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), except that Tax partially purified by nickel-nitriloacetic acid resin (Qiagen Inc.) was further purified by Q-Sepharose anion exchange column chromatography. Single cysteine CREB327(approximately 20 μm) was dialyzed extensively into 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and then incubated with 2 mm fluorescein-maleimide or tetramethylrhodamine-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 2 h at 20 °C and then 4 °C overnight. Reactions were quenched with 5 mm DTT and modified protein separated from unreacted fluor by gel filtration (HiTrap Desalting column, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Modified proteins were then dialyzed extensively against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the somatostatin CRE have been described previously (32Loriaux M.M. Rehfuss R.P. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9046-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A duplex oligonucleotide corresponding to the promoter proximal Tax-responsive element (−107 to −81; Ref. 1Gitlin S.D. Dittmer J. Reid R.L. Brady J.N. Human Retroviruses. IRL Press, New York1993: 159-192Google Scholar) was formed by annealing 5′-GATCTCCTCAGGCGTTGACGACAACCCCTCAC-3′(upper strand), to the complementary oligonucleotide, 5′-GATCGTGAGGGGTTGTCGTCAACGCCTGAGGA-3′. Oligonucleotides with inosine substitutions flanking the CRE-like sequence of the TxRE (IC-TxRE) were synthesized commercially (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR) with the sequences 5′-GATCTCCTCAIICITTGACGACAACCCCTCAC-3′ (upper strand), and 5′-GATCGTGAIIIITTGTCGTCAACICCTGAGGA-3′. Steady state fluorescence measurements of labeled proteins were made using a SPEX Fluoromax spectrofluorimeter. All binding measurements were determined in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol, 50 μg/ml BSA, at 20 °C in a 1-ml binding reaction. For dimerization reactions, efficiency of fluorescence quenching was determined from fluorescein emission at 515 nm, following excitation at 485 nm. Data were fitted to a simple bimolecular binding model by nonlinear regression (33Lundblad J.R. Laurance M. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). 1,10-Phenanthroline-copper DNA footprinting was performed as described previously (34Sigman D.S. Kuwabara M.D. Chen C.-H. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 414-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) using a DNA fragment corresponding to the −1 to −300 region of the HTLV-1 LTR end-labeled at a single terminus with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (1Gitlin S.D. Dittmer J. Reid R.L. Brady J.N. Human Retroviruses. IRL Press, New York1993: 159-192Google Scholar). Footprinting ladders were resolved on 6% acrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel and exposed to a storage phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics). A DNA sequencing ladder (30Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8988) Google Scholar) was run next to the cleavage reactions to identify the location of the TxRE 21 base pair repeats. DNA binding was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (32Loriaux M.M. Rehfuss R.P. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9046-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Duplex oligodeoxyribonucleotides were radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (>6000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). Binding reactions consisted of a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml poly(dI·dC), 200 μg/ml BSA (New England Biolabs), 1 nm32P-labeled duplex oligodeoxyribonucleotide, and Tax and CREB concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. Free and protein-bound DNA were electrophoretically separated by 5% native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA, and exposed to a storage phosphor screen. Minor groove-binding drugs distamycin A and chromomycin A3 were obtained from Sigma. Distamycin A (100 mm) was prepared in distilled water and stored at −20 °C. Chromomycin A3 (100 mm) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide and stored at −20 °C. We utilized an approach based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer to detect self-association of CREB in the absence of DNA binding and to determine whether Tax enhances the DNA binding activity of CREB through enhancement of dimerization. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements have been used previously to study dimerization of Fos and Jun, the components of the AP-1 complex (35Patel L.R. Curran T. Kerppola T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7360-7364Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The specificity of this approach relies on the strict distance dependence of nonradiative energy transfer (36Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). For this assay, we used a single cysteine form of CREB327in which cysteines at positions 286 and 323 were changed to serine residues by site-directed mutagenesis, preserving a single cysteine residue at amino acid 296 (at the first c position within the coiled-coil heptad repeat, Fig. 1 A). Previous studies have demonstrated that these cysteines are dispensable for high affinity DNA binding. For example, the B/ZIP of GCN4 lacks these cysteine residues, yet binds CRE sequences with high affinity (37Sellers J.W. Vincent A.C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5077-5086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Weiss M.A. Ellenberger T.E. Wobbe C.R. Lee J.P. Harrison S.C. Struhl K. Nature. 1990; 347: 575-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Santiago-Riveraet al. (39Santiago-Rivera Z.I. Williams J.S. Gorenstein D.G. Andrisani O.M. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1461-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) demonstrated that iodoacetamide carboxymethylation of CREB B/ZIP peptides at these cysteines did not alter DNA binding activity, but rather diminished aggregation and enhanced solubility of these peptides in solution. Mutation of a cysteine to a serine in the basic regions of Fos and Jun had a similar stabilizing effect (40Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Finally, Richards et al. (29Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13716-13723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) demonstrated that DNA binding of CREB341 lacking these three cysteine residues was not altered. The structure of the CREB B/ZIP is not known, but may be modeled on the structure of the GCN4 B/ZIP bound to DNA (41Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar,42König P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Based on GCN4, the cysteine at position 296 is predicted to lie on the outer face of the dimeric coiled-coil leucine zipper motif, away from the dimerization interface. The sulfur-sulfur distance between subunits of a homodimer of single cysteine CREB is predicted to be approximately 18 Å. We labeled single cysteine CREB327 (Cys-296) with thiol-reactive fluorescein-maleimide (F-CREB) or tetramethylrhodamine-maleimide (Rh-CREB). The Förster distance, or the distance of 50% energy transfer efficiency, for the fluorescein-rhodamine pair is about 46 Å (36Selvin P.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 300-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar); thus, we expected heterodimerization of F-CREB with Rh-CREB would result in significant energy transfer between fluorochromes. In the binding assay a trace amount of fluorescein-conjugated CREB is mixed with an increasing concentration of tetramethylrhodamine-labeled CREB, pairing F-CREB with Rh-CREB under conditions of Rh-CREB excess. Energy transfer from donor fluorescein to acceptor rhodamine, detected by a quenching of the fluorescein fluorescence intensity, depends on the precise steric positioning of dimerization. Because of the sixth power dependence of efficiency of energy transfer, no quenching will occur in the absence of dimerization. Fig. 1 B shows an emission spectrum of fluoresceinated CREB in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration of rhodamine-CREB, with an excitation wavelength of 485 nm, the optimum for fluorescein. In the absence of Rh-CREB, F-CREB has an emission maximum of 515 nm. In the presence of Rh-CREB, we observed reduced fluorescence intensity at 515 nm, and increased fluorescence intensity at the tetramethylrhodamine emission peak of 575 nm, indicating energy transfer. The kinetics of fluorescence quenching were determined by a rapid mixing experiment, in which 5 nm F-CREB was mixed in a cuvette with 100 nm Rh-CREB in binding buffer, and then fluorescence emission intensity was measured at 515 nm at 1-s intervals for 900 s (Fig. 2 A). The kinetics of dimer exchange (the dissociation of F-CREB and Rh-CREB dimers by dilution, followed by association of F-CREB and Rh-CREB into heterodimers) are slow. The decay fits a single exponential, with a half-life of 104 ± 1 s. These results suggest a high affinity for dimerization. Injection of F-CREB alone into sample buffer had no effect on fluorescence intensity with time (Fig. 2 A). We demonstrated the specificity of the assay by performing the same experiment under conditions where the dimerization of CREB could not occur. We first performed the same kinetic experiment in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride. The same concentrations of F-CREB and Rh-CREB were rapidly mixed in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol. Under these conditions, we detected no fluorescence quenching (Fig. 2 B). We performed a similar experiment by using a single cysteine CREB destabilized by amino acid substitutions in thee and g positions of the leucine zipper. This mutant, which fails to form homodimers and bind DNA (32Loriaux M.M. Rehfuss R.P. Brennan R.G. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9046-9050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) also fails to interact in this assay (data not shown). We then measured the equilibrium dissociation constant (K d) for CREB dimerization and asked whether HTLV-1 Tax enhanced CREB dimerization. For these experiments, 500 pm F-CREB was titrated with increasing concentrations of Rh-CREB in the absence of specific DNA and allowed to come to equilibrium. Fig. 3 shows the extent of quenching as a function of CREB concentration in the absence or presence of bacterially expressed Tax. First, the equilibrium dissociation constant for dimerization of CREB as measured by this method is low, with a K d of 0.6 nm. Tax had no significant effect on the affinity of dimerization, as shown by the half-maximal quenching concentration (K d = 0.8 nm); however, Tax did reduce the maximum efficiency of energy transfer, suggesting that the association of Tax with the CREB dimer increases the intersubunit distance. The fluor-conjugated proteins bound the somatostatin CRE with an affinity identical to wild type CREB as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (data not shown). The modified proteins were also recruited to the TxRE by Tax in a manner identical to the wild type proteins (data not shown), demonstrating that the conjugation does not alter the interaction of CREB with DNA, or the effect of Tax. Previous studies from several laboratories have demonstrated that Tax forms a stable complex with CREB both in the absence (22Goren I. Semmes O. Jeang K.-T. Moelling K. J.

The cDNA for human PAPS synthase (hPAPSS) along with polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to several NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments were cloned and expressed in COS-1 cells. A 1–268-amino acid fragment expressed APS kinase activity, whereas a 220–623 fragment evinced ATP sulfurylase activity. The 1–268 fragment and full-length hPAPSS (1–623) exhibited hyperbolic responses against APS substrate with equivalent K m values (0.6 and 0.4 μm, respectively). The 1–268 fragment demonstrated Michaelis-Menten kinetics against ATP as substrate (K m 0.26 mm); however, full-length hPAPSS exhibited a sigmoidal response (apparent K m1.5 mm) suggesting cooperative binding. Catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) of the 1–268 fragment was 64-fold higher than full-length hPAPSS for ATP. The kinetic data suggest that the COOH-terminal domain of hPAPSS exerts a regulatory role over APS kinase activity located in the NH2-terminal domain of this bifunctional protein. In addition, the 1–268 fragment and full-length hPAPSS were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and column purified. Purified full-length hPAPSS, in contrast to the COS-1 cell-expressed cDNA construct, exhibited a hyperbolic response curve against ATP suggesting that hPAPSS is perhaps modified in vivo. The universal sulfonate donor, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS), is synthesized by the concerted action of ATP sulfurylase and adenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) kinase, which in animals are fused into a bifunctional protein. The cDNA for human PAPS synthase (hPAPSS) along with polymerase chain reaction products corresponding to several NH2- and COOH-terminal fragments were cloned and expressed in COS-1 cells. A 1–268-amino acid fragment expressed APS kinase activity, whereas a 220–623 fragment evinced ATP sulfurylase activity. The 1–268 fragment and full-length hPAPSS (1–623) exhibited hyperbolic responses against APS substrate with equivalent K m values (0.6 and 0.4 μm, respectively). The 1–268 fragment demonstrated Michaelis-Menten kinetics against ATP as substrate (K m 0.26 mm); however, full-length hPAPSS exhibited a sigmoidal response (apparent K m1.5 mm) suggesting cooperative binding.

The sulfonation of endobiotics and xenobiotics is a fundamental metabolic process of major importance. The sulfoconjugation of biomolecules occurs widely, involves compounds with molecular weights ranging in size from <103 to >106 and results in a dramatic change in the physicochemical property of the sulfonated compounds (1Huxtable R.J. Biochemistry of Sulfur. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 293-358Crossref Google Scholar). Sulfonated macromolecules such as glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans are involved in cell surface structure and connective tissue. The sulfonation of tyrosine residues has been established as a widespread post-translational modification for many secretory and membrane proteins. Sulfolipids such as sphingolipids and galactoglycerolipids are concentrated in the brain, peripheral nerves, and reproductive tissues. Additionally, sulfoconjugation is important in the biotransformation of many endogenous low molecular weight compounds such as neurotransmitters and hormones, e.g.catecholamines, iodothyronines, and steroids. The sulfonation of drugs and xenobiotics functions primarily to inactivate and clear these generally hydrophobic compounds from the body, although there are examples where the active form of a drug is sulfonated. In the course of sulfonation, inorganic sulfate must beactivated prior to being transferred to an acceptor molecule (2Gregory J.D. Robbins P.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1960; 29: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In mammalian metabolism, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) 1The abbreviations used are: PAPS, 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate; hPAPS, human PAPS; APS, adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl; CMV, cytomegalovirus. has been identified as the activated sulfate molecule (3Robbins P.W. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 681-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and represents the universal sulfonate (SO3−) donor for all sulfotransferase reactions (4Farooqui A.A. Int. J. Biochem. 1980; 12: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The activation of inorganic sulfate to form PAPS results from the concerted action of two enzymes (3Robbins P.W. Lipmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 233: 681-685Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bandurski R.S. Wilson L.G. Squires C.L. J. Am. Chem.

The first step is catalyzed by ATP-sulfurylase (ATP:sulfate adenylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.4) and involves the reaction of inorganic sulfate with ATP to form adenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (APS) and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). This reaction results in the formation of a high energy phosphoric-sulfuric acid anhydride bond that is the chemical basis for sulfate activation (8Leyh T.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 515-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the direction of APS formation the enzyme has an unfavorable equilibrium (K eq ∼ 10−7m) (9Segal I.H. Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); it has been suggested that the reaction is driven in the physiologic direction by the hydrolysis of PPi by the action of a ubiquitous inorganic pyrophosphatase (9Segal I.H. Renosto F. Seubert P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The second step is catalyzed by APS kinase (ATP:adenylylsulfate 3′-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.25) and involves the reaction of APS with ATP to form PAPS and ADP. Unlike ATP sulfurylase, APS kinase is not involved in the activation of sulfate, and its raison d'être is not known (8Leyh T.S. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 515-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase cloned from bacteria (10Leyh T.S. Taylor J.C. Markham G.D. J. Biol.

Acta. 1994; 1218: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Leustek T. Murillo M. Cervantes M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) are found on separate polypeptide chains. In these species the molecular mass of ATP sulfurylase ranges from 35.2 to 63.9 kDa, whereas the molecular mass of APS kinase ranges from 22.3 to 29.7 kDa. In contrast to what is found in bacteria, fungi, yeast, and plants, however, ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase isolated from mammalian tissues, e.g. rat chondrosarcoma (20Lyle S. Stanczak J. Ng K. Schwartz N.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5920-5925Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and guinea pig adrenal 2K. V. Venkatachalam and C. A. Strott, unpublished data. are physically linked on bifunctional proteins of M r 56,000 and 55,000, respectively. Confirmation of this important finding was obtained with the cloning of cDNAs from the marine worm (21Rosenthal E. Leustek T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 165: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and mouse (22Li H. Deyrup A. Mensch Jr., J.R. Domowicz M. Konstantinidas A.K. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29453-29459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) that expressed a protein containing both ATP sulfurylase and APS kinase activity (PAPS synthase). The dual nature of worm and mouse PAPS synthase indicates that APS kinase and ATP sulfurylase, located on separate polypeptide chains in lower life forms, have fused into a single bifunctional protein in higher organisms. Using an expressed sequence tag from a directionally cloned human infant brain cDNA library that shares 60% identity to yeast APS kinase (23Adams M.D. Soares M.B. Kerlavage A.R. Fields C. Venter J.C. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), we have cloned the cDNA for human PAPS synthase using fetal brain RNA. To identify functional domains, various NH2- and COOH-terminal constructs of hPAPS synthase were expressed in COS-1 cells, assayed for catalytic activity, subjected to kinetic analysis, and the results compared with those obtained with full-length hPAPS synthase. Additionally, the full-length PAPS synthase protein and the enzymatically active NH2-terminal peptide fragment were overexpressed in bacteria, purified, and analyzed kinetically for comparison to the COS-1 cell-expressed recombinant DNA constructs. Radionucleotides [α-35S]ATP for DNA sequencing and [35S]PAPS for enzyme assays were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Cruachem (Dulles, VA). Taq polymerase and reagents for PCR were obtained from Perkin-Elmer. Human fetal brain poly(A)+ RNA was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). TA cloning kit was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Version-2 sequencing kit was obtained from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Reverse transcription-PCR kit was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Agarose was purchased from FMC (Rockland, ME) and thin-layer chromatography plates came from E. Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). All PCR primers used to generate the various constructs were designed based on the DNA sequence of hPAPS synthase and are indicated in Fig. 1. The depicted sequences given for PCR primers contain an overhang region identified by underlining. Reverse transcription-PCR was performed using human fetal brain poly(A)+ RNA and the antisense primer AS-4 (5′-CTAAGGAAGCATGTCCAGACAGACACC-3′) that corresponds to a region in the 3′-untranslated region. Reverse transcription and cDNA purification were performed according to instructions provided by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). First strand cDNA was synthesized using 1 μg of human fetal brain poly(A)+RNA and Superscript II reverse transcriptase. RNA in the presence of the primer was denatured for 7 min at 75 °C and then chilled on ice for 1 min; transcription was carried out at 42 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by incubation at 72 °C for 15 min. The RNA was degraded with RNase H at 52 °C, and the cDNA was purified using a GlassMAX spin cartridge (Life Technologies, Inc.). An aliquot of the first strand cDNA was used as a template for subsequent PCR amplification using the antisense primer AS-1 and the sense primer S-1(5′-AATTTAATATAACCGGTCATGGAGATCCCCG-GGAGCTTG-3′). The S-1 primer extends from the 5′-untranslated region into the coding region and contains a variation of the Kozak sequence (24Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar). Thermal cycle phases consisted of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. The PCR product was analyzed on a 1% low melting agarose gel; the expected product (1.98 kilobase pairs) was sliced out of the gel and purified with a spin cartridge (Superec-01) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Panvera, Madison, WI). The 1.98-kilobase pair PCR product (contains the complete coding region) was directly ligated into a PCR 3.1 bidirectional mammalian TA cloning-expression vector, the ligated plasmid construct transformed into F-10 competent cells and recombinant clones were selected. Recombinant bacteria were mini-prepped (Promega, Madison, WI), and the resulting plasmid was verified for the presence of the PAPS synthase insert and the CMV promoter in the proper orientation by DNA sequencing using T7 and PCR 3.1 reverse primer provided by Invitrogen. The full-length hPAPS synthase PCR product served as a template for constructing NH2-terminal (amino acids 1–174, 1–209, 1–268) and COOH-terminal (amino acids 220–623, and 264–623) fragments (cf. Fig. 1). Procedures for performing PCR, isolation of PCR products, insertion into the TA cloning vector, transformation, and sequencing were the same as those used for the full-length construct. The amino acid 1–174 PCR product was obtained using the sense primer S-1 and the antisense primer AS-1 (5′-CTAGTAGAGTCCTTTGACATCCCTCTGTTCACT-3′). The amino acid 1–209 PCR product was obtained using the sense primer S-1 and the antisense primer AS-2 (5′-CTATACATCACAGGAGTCTGTTTTCAGCACCAA-3′). The amino acid 1–268 PCR product was obtained using the sense primer S-1 and the antisense primer AS-3 (5′-CTACTGCACCCACTGCATATCCAC-3′). All antisense primers contain a CTA overhang which generates a TAG stop codon on the sense strand. The amino acid 220–623 PCR product was obtained using the sense primer S-2 (3′-AATTTAATATAACCGGTCATGCTACAGGAACGGGATATTGTACCT-3′) and the antisense primer AS-4. The amino acid 264–623 PCR product was obtained using the sense primer S-3 (5′-AATTTAATATAACCGGTCATGCAGTGGGTGCAGGTTTTCGCA-3′) and the antisense primer AS-4. The overhang of the S-3 primer along with a mutation of the C following the ATG start codon to a G (cf. Fig. 1) creates the same Kozak sequence variation as is present for the full-length construct (the mutation converts the normal glutamine residue to a glutamate). The NH2- and COOH-terminal constructs were cloned into the PCR 3.1 expression vector, similar to the full-length construct; the plasmids were verified for proper orientation with respect to the CMV promoter by DNA sequencing. Controls consisting of an empty vector and a vector with the full-length construct inserted in the reverse orientation relative to the CMV promoter were used. Bacterial clones containing mammalian expression vectors for the full-length, NH2-, and COOH-terminal constructs were isolated and grown in bulk to obtain large quantities of DNA using a mega-prep kit as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The purified plasmids were used for transfection of mammalian COS-1 cells. The full-length PAPS synthase and 1–268 NH2-terminal PCR 3.1 constructs were amplified by PCR using primers designed to contain BamHI restriction sites: full-length PAPS synthase primers; forward primer, 5′-TAAGGATCCAATGGAGATCCCCGGGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TAGTGGATCCAGCATGTCCAGACAGACACC-3′. 1–268 NH2-terminal peptide primers: forward primer, 5′-TAAGGATCCAATGGAGATCCCCGGGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TAGTGGATCCCTACTGCACCCACTG-3′. Briefly, PCR conditions were optimized (annealing 52/48 °C, 35 cycles) to give sufficient amounts of product for cloning. After preparative PCR ∼ 0.5 μg of product was excised, eluted from agarose gels, and digested with BamHI after which the restriction enzyme was inactivated and the DNA extracted with phenol-chloroform. The DNA preparation was diluted into appropriate exchange buffer and concentrated by Centricon-100 centrifugation (also removes small digestion fragments). Two pET-19b vectors, containing a proprietary 122-base pair NcoI-NdeI cassette (Veritas, Potomac, MD) encoding the calmodulin-binding site of calcineurin followed by a histidine tag and enterokinase cleavage site, were similarly digested with BamHI and purified. Amplified PCR products were ligated into the two vectors using T-4 DNA ligase at 3:1, 5:1, and 10:1 molar ratio of insert to vector. Fresh competent cells (strain DH-5a) were prepared by the CaCl2 procedure for transformation (efficiency was verified by transforming the batch of cells with pUC-18 plasmid), which was carried out overnight at 37 °C on ampicillin plates. Transformants were analyzed by PCR using primer combinations (T7/reverse, forward/reverse, and controls that precluded spurious positives (e.g. T7/forward). Colonies showing correct orientation and insert size were grown separately for plasmid purification using Qiagen columns and analyzed by gel electrophoresis using the PCR analysis. Briefly, colonies are grown in ampicillin medium to an OD of 0.6, at which time 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside is added to induce expression. Cells are collected by centrifugation and extracted with TE buffer plus 1 mg/ml lysozyme (extracts are frozen at −70 °C). Extracts are thawed, homogenized with tube and pestle to reduce viscosity, and clarified by centrifugation; the supernatants are adjusted with 0.25 NaCl and adsorbed to nickel columns (nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose). The columns are washed with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, plus 0.25 m NaCl) and eluted with 0.25 m imidazole, pH 7.0. Column eluates are dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 20% sucrose. The eluted material is analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to demonstrate the isolated ∼70 kDa full-length PAPS synthase or ∼30 kDa 1–268 NH2-terminal peptide by silver staining and immunoblot. A preparation of His-fusion protein is carried out using 1 liter of cells, which have endogenous APS kinase “repressed” by adding cysteine and methionine to the growth medium. COS-1 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown in 75-cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. When cells reached 50–60% confluency they were placed in serum- and antibiotic-free medium and co-transfected with 30 μg of plasmid DNA of various constructs and 15 μg β-galactosidase plasmid (Promega), respectively. Transfections were achieved with 150 μl of LipofectAMINE® in 12 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and incubations were carried out for 5 h, at which point additional medium containing serum and antibiotics was added and the incubations continued for an additional 15 h. The transfection medium was removed and cells were placed in fresh complete medium and incubated for another 48 h, after which cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by scraping, centrifuged briefly at 1000 × g and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20% sucrose, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml aprotinin and soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The resuspended cells were lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles, and the resulting homogenates spun at 10,000 rpm for 15 min in a microcentrifuge. The prepared cellular extracts were assayed for enzymatic activity. The substrate [35S]APS was prepared from [35S]PAPS by a modification of the procedure outlined by Satishchandran et al. (25Satishchandran C. Markham G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15012-15021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, [35S]PAPS was treated with mung bean 3′-nuclease (Sigma), which yielded quantitative production of [35S]APS. The preparation of [35S]APS was subjected to gel filtration using a 1-ml Sephadex G-25 mini-column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the purified radioactive APS was used for the enzyme assays. The APS kinase assay was performed in a total volume of 10 μl. The APS kinase assay consisted of 3 μl of reaction buffer (150 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EDTA, 45 mm dithiothreitol), 4 μl enzyme preparation, 1 μl of H2O or 50 mm ATP, 2 μl [35S]APS (50–100 pmol/2–3 × 105 cpm). The ATP sulfurylase assay was performed in a total volume of 20 μl and consisted of 6 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 12 mm MgCl2, 45 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm NaF), 2 μl enzyme preparation, 4 μl of 40 mm PPi, 4 μl [35S]APS (50–100 pmol/2–3 × 105 cpm), and 4 μl of H2O. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 15 min for the APS kinase assay and 5 min for the ATP sulfurylase assay and stopped by placing reaction tubes in boiling water for 5 min. 1-μl aliquots were transferred to polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin-layer chromatography plates and chromatographed using 0.9m LiCl as the solvent system. Following chromatography the thin-layer chromatography plates were dried and exposed overnight to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The respective spots for PAPS, APS, and sulfate were cut out, and the radioactivity determined by liquid scintillation. For the overexpressed and purified NH2-terminal fragment of hPAPS synthase and the full-length hPAPS synthase protein, samples containing ∼1 μg of protein were assayed. Cellular extracts (100 μl) were diluted with 175 μl of water and 225 μl of 2× assay buffer (Promega). Samples were mixed and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of 1 mNaCO3. The reaction product was assayed by OD at 420 nm, and the β-galactosidase activity (in units) was determined using a standard curve. All peptides based on human PAPS synthase were prepared by Peptide Technologies Corp. (Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, NH2-terminal-specific peptide (LDGDNIRQGLNKNLGFS, residues 86–102) and COOH-terminal-specific peptide (RGYRRPVLLLHPLGWTKDDDVPLMWRMKQH, residues 442–471) were synthesized by solid-phase methods coupling Fmoc amino acid derivatives and removal of the peptide from the resin and deprotection of side chains by reaction with trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and analyzed for identity and purity by amino acid analysis and analytical high pressure liquid chromatography. The NH2-terminal-specific peptide with Cys at the NH2 terminus was synthesized starting with Fmoc-butyl-Ser Wang resin; the final peptide was 98.4% pure. The COOH-terminal-specific peptide also with Cys at the NH2terminus was synthesized on Fmoc-trityl-His tentagel resin; the final peptide was 97.4% pure by high pressure liquid chromatography. The peptides were coupled through the NH2-terminal cysteine residues to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the N-maleimidylN-hydroxysuccinimide coupling method (26Kitagawa T. Aikawa T. J. Biochem. 1976; 79: 223-236Google Scholar, 27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). The conjugates were dialyzed and analyzed by amino acid analysis to indicate coupling of peptides to carrier. Antibodies were produced in New Zealand White rabbits by a modification of the multiple intradermal protocol (28Vaitukaitis J.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 46-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) using an initial dose of 500 μg of peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Booster injections of 250 μg of peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were repeated at 3 week intervals, and blood samples were collected at 10–14 days following each boost. Proteins in cellular extracts (30 μl) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% polyacrylamide gels obtained from Novex, Inc. (San Diego, CA) and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P membranes from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.1% casein in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (blocking buffer), following which the membranes were exposed to the primary antibody (1:1500 dilution) for 1 h. The blots were then washed three times with the blocking buffer and incubated with the secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution) for an additional 1 h. Finally, the membranes were subjected to three washes in blocking buffer and two additional washes in reaction buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and the blots were developed by color reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions (KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) The software program used for protein alignment was GeneWorks 2.5 (Oxford Molecular Group, Campbell, CA). GeneWorks employs a progressive alignment method, building the alignment in approximate phylogenetic order as determined by a scoring algorithm similar to FASTA and the CLUSTAL V multiple sequence alignment algorithm. The 1–268 amino acid NH2-terminal fragment of hPAPS synthase is significantly homologous to APS kinase cloned from other species (Table I), specifically yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae (GenBankTM accession no. S17244), the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum(GenBankTM accession no. U39393), Escherichia coli cys C gene product (GenBankTM accession no. A44200), symbiotic nodulating bacteria Rhizobium meliloti (GenBankTMaccession no. M68858), and Azospirillum brasilense(GenBankTM accession no. M94886) nod Qgene products, and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana(GenBankTM accession no. S47640). Sequence alignment (Fig. 2) reveals 51 identities (25%) and 88 similarities (44%). Furthermore, there are three conserved nucleotide binding motifs (indicated by bold boxes in Fig. 2): a P-loop nucleotide binding motif, a GTP interactive motif, and a PAPS binding motif. The P-loop motif is variously represented as GXXXXGK (29Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar, 30Dever T.E. Glynias M.J.

Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), GXXXXGK(S/T) (32Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), GXXXXGK(T/S) (33Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar), and GXXGXGK (34Müller C.W. Schulz G.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). It is the latter form that is present in hPAPS synthase. The GTP interactive motif consists of DXXG (30Dever T.E. Glynias M.J. Merrick W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1814-1818Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 32Valencia A. Chardin P. Wittinghofer A. Sander C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4637-4648Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the PAPS binding motif consists of K(A/G)XXGXXX(N/E)X(0–1)FT (35Satishchandran C. Hickman Y.N. Markham G.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11684-11688Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Additionally, a FISP motif, present between the P-loop and DXXG motifs, is also conserved (cf. Fig. 2).

On the basis of their reactivity with DTNB (0.5 mm), three classes of thiols have been defined as follows: fast reacting (fHbSH), with t½ <100 ms; slow reacting (sHbSH), with t½ 30–50 s; and very slow reacting (vsHbSH), with t½ 180–270 s. Under paraphysiological conditions, fHbSH (identified with Cys-125β(H3)) conjugates with DTNB 100 times faster than glutathione and ∼4000 times more rapidly than (v)sHbSH (Cys-13α(A11) and Cys-93β(F9)). Such characteristics of fHbSH reactivity that are independent of the quaternary state of hemoglobin are mainly due to the following: (i) its low pK (∼6.9, the cysteinyl anion being stabilized by a hydrogen bond with Ser-123β(H1)) and (ii) the large exposure to the solvent (as measured by analysis of a model of the molecular surface) and make these thiols the kinetically preferred groups in rat erythrocytes for S-conjugation. In addition, because of the high cellular concentration (8 mm, i.e. four times that of glutathione), fHbSHs are expected to intercept damaging species in erythrocytes more efficiently than glutathione, thus adding a new physiopathological role (direct involvement in cellular strategies of antioxidant defense) to cysteinyl residues in proteins.

In the present study, the reactivities of cysteinyl residues in rat hemoglobin components have been characterized, and the differences have been interpreted in terms of molecular structure. The reported results are consistent with a major role played, in the transient adaptation of rat erythrocyte to oxidative stress, by thiols that do not show conformational-associated changes in their microenvironment.DISCUSSIONSince amino groups generally remain protonated below pH 10, the major nucleophilic functionality available in biological systems are thiols, which, accordingly, are the chemical groups that provide strong defense against electrophilic species. One of the objectives of the present research was to characterize in kinetic terms the reactivity of rat hemoglobin thiols under conditions mimicking the physiological ones. Therefore, this study was limited to free reactive thiols, whereas the so-called masked sulfhydryls, i.e.Cys-104α(G11) and Cys-111α(G18), which are located at the α1β1 interface and whose reactivity is controlled by the tetramer dissociation beyond the dimer stage (52Chiancone E. Currell D.L. Vecchini P. Antonini E. Wyman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4105-4111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were neglected.The peculiar reactivity of fHbSH present on most of the rat hemoglobin components is clearly responsible for the formation of HbSSG after oxidative stress by diamide. Thiols in proteins are integral to a number of cellular functions, including protein folding, enzyme catalysis, and metabolic regulation (36Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 53Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: XIIICrossref Google Scholar). The reported findings clearly suggest an involvement of fHbSH as a direct moderator of oxidative stress at least in rat erythrocytes. Red cells are regularly subjected to high oxygen tension and are among the first body cells exposed to exogenous oxidative substances that are ingested, inhaled, or injected. The importance of an antioxidant function in erythrocytes is well known and is shown, e.g. by the massive oxidant-induced hemolysis seen in subjects with a marked deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (54Luzzatto L. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1987; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).The possible contribution of fHbSH to the intracellular detoxifying mechanism appears to be in line with the definition of the term antioxidant (55Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radical Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, London1989: 9Google Scholar, 56Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar) for both the intrinsic chemical properties and the intraerythrocyte concentration. However, this thiol system seems to be suited to resist acute episodes of oxidant fluxes but not the prolonged ones, because its efficiency is somewhat impaired by the long recovery time (see Table I). Since the reactivity of Cys-125β(H3) is not linked to the oxygenation nor to the quaternary state of hemoglobin (see Table III), fHbSH are expected to quickly produceS-conjugates in both the arterial and venous blood; in other words, flow in the blood circulation is expected not to induce a cycle (speeding up and slowing down) in the reactivity of fHbSH, as described for the highly conserved Cys-93β(F9) (and possibly true also for Cys-13α(A11)) that, being oxygen-linked, modulates arterial-venous differences in intraerythrocyte S-nitrosothiols (57Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar, 58Di Simplicio P. Lusini L. Giannerini F. Giustarini D. Bellelli A. Boumis G. Amiconi G. Rossi R. Moncada S. Higgs H.A. Bagetta G. Nitric Oxide and Cell: Proliferation and Death. Portland Press Ltd., London1998Google Scholar). Moreover, the S-conjugation capacity of fHbSH is very high. In fact, from the mean red cell volume (61.6 fl), the mean erythrocyte hemoglobin concentration (21.1 pg), the molecular mass of tetrameric hemoglobin (65 kDa), the fraction of isoforms carrying fHbSH (0.76), and the number of fast reacting cysteinyl residues per tetramer (two), an intracellular level of fHbSH equal to 8 mm can be calculated; this value, which is four times that of glutathione (2 mm), is great enough to force the conclusion that fHbSH works as a buffer system able to trap a large amount of attacking (electrophilic) species in a very short time. Finally, in the particular case investigated it can be also speculated that the efficient nonenzymatic antioxidant defense offered by fHbSH is able to compensate for the poor catalytic activity of glutathione reductase in rat erythrocytes (see Table III).In conclusion and from a more general point of view, the reported results emphasize an additional function of some kinds of protein cysteinyl residues, i.e. a direct detoxification role by conjugation more efficient than low molecular weight thiols, such as glutathione. Human but not rat erythrocytes are reported (1Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. Vol. III. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1989: 319-356Google Scholar) to be able to restore the cellular pool of GSH, which is strongly decreased after treatment with diazenedicarboxylic acid bis(N,N-dimethylamide), a thiol-oxidizing agent known by the trivial name diamide (2Kosower N.S.

In the present study, the reactivities of cysteinyl residues in rat hemoglobin components have been characterized, and the differences have been interpreted in terms of molecular structure. The reported results are consistent with a major role played, in the transient adaptation of rat erythrocyte to oxidative stress, by thiols that do not show conformational-associated changes in their microenvironment. DISCUSSIONSince amino groups generally remain protonated below pH 10, the major nucleophilic functionality available in biological systems are thiols, which, accordingly, are the chemical groups that provide strong defense against electrophilic species. One of the objectives of the present research was to characterize in kinetic terms the reactivity of rat hemoglobin thiols under conditions mimicking the physiological ones. Therefore, this study was limited to free reactive thiols, whereas the so-called masked sulfhydryls, i.e.Cys-104α(G11) and Cys-111α(G18), which are located at the α1β1 interface and whose reactivity is controlled by the tetramer dissociation beyond the dimer stage (52Chiancone E. Currell D.L. Vecchini P. Antonini E. Wyman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4105-4111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were neglected.The peculiar reactivity of fHbSH present on most of the rat hemoglobin components is clearly responsible for the formation of HbSSG after oxidative stress by diamide. Thiols in proteins are integral to a number of cellular functions, including protein folding, enzyme catalysis, and metabolic regulation (36Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 53Packer L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: XIIICrossref Google Scholar). The reported findings clearly suggest an involvement of fHbSH as a direct moderator of oxidative stress at least in rat erythrocytes. Red cells are regularly subjected to high oxygen tension and are among the first body cells exposed to exogenous oxidative substances that are ingested, inhaled, or injected. The importance of an antioxidant function in erythrocytes is well known and is shown, e.g. by the massive oxidant-induced hemolysis seen in subjects with a marked deficiency of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (54Luzzatto L. Cell Biochem. Funct. 1987; 5: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar).The possible contribution of fHbSH to the intracellular detoxifying mechanism appears to be in line with the definition of the term antioxidant (55Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radical Biology and Medicine. Clarendon Press, London1989: 9Google Scholar, 56Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar) for both the intrinsic chemical properties and the intraerythrocyte concentration. However, this thiol system seems to be suited to resist acute episodes of oxidant fluxes but not the prolonged ones, because its efficiency is somewhat impaired by the long recovery time (see Table I). Since the reactivity of Cys-125β(H3) is not linked to the oxygenation nor to the quaternary state of hemoglobin (see Table III), fHbSH are expected to quickly produceS-conjugates in both the arterial and venous blood; in other words, flow in the blood circulation is expected not to induce a cycle (speeding up and slowing down) in the reactivity of fHbSH, as described for the highly conserved Cys-93β(F9) (and possibly true also for Cys-13α(A11)) that, being oxygen-linked, modulates arterial-venous differences in intraerythrocyte S-nitrosothiols (57Jia L.

Moreover, the S-conjugation capacity of fHbSH is very high. In fact, from the mean red cell volume (61.6 fl), the mean erythrocyte hemoglobin concentration (21.1 pg), the molecular mass of tetrameric hemoglobin (65 kDa), the fraction of isoforms carrying fHbSH (0.76), and the number of fast reacting cysteinyl residues per tetramer (two), an intracellular level of fHbSH equal to 8 mm can be calculated; this value, which is four times that of glutathione (2 mm), is great enough to force the conclusion that fHbSH works as a buffer system able to trap a large amount of attacking (electrophilic) species in a very short time. Finally, in the particular case investigated it can be also speculated that the efficient nonenzymatic antioxidant defense offered by fHbSH is able to compensate for the poor catalytic activity of glutathione reductase in rat erythrocytes (see Table III).In conclusion and from a more general point of view, the reported results emphasize an additional function of some kinds of protein cysteinyl residues, i.e. a direct detoxification role by conjugation more efficient than low molecular weight thiols, such as glutathione.

https://openalex.org/W2088230474,"The mammalian transcription factor LSF (also known as CP2 and LBP-1c) binds as a homo-oligomer to directly repeated elements in viral and cellular promoters. LSF and theDrosophila transcription factor NTF-1 (also known as Elf-1 and Grainyhead) share a similar DNA binding region, which is unlike any established DNA binding motifs. However, we demonstrate that dimeric NTF-1 can bind an LSF half-site, whereas LSF cannot. To characterize further the DNA binding and oligomerization characteristics of LSF, truncation mutants were used to demonstrate that between 234 and 320 amino acids of LSF are required for high affinity DNA binding. Mixing of a truncation mutant with full-length LSF in a DNA binding assay established that the form of LSF that binds DNA is larger than a dimer. Unexpectedly, one C-terminal deletion derivative, partially defective in oligomerization properties, could occupy odd numbers of adjacent, tandem LSF half-sites, unlike full-length LSF. The numbers of DNA-protein complexes formed on multiple half-sites with this mutant indicated that LSF binds DNA as a tetramer, although cross-linking experiments confirmed a previous report concluding that LSF is primarily dimeric in solution. The DNA binding and oligomerization properties of LSF support models depicting novel mechanisms to prevent continual, adjacent binding by a protein that recognizes directly repeated DNA sequences."

Properties of PilD mutants at positions Gly<sup>95</sup> and/or Lys<sup>96</sup> which were differentially affected in leader peptidase and <i>N</i>-methyltransferase function were characterized.

https://openalex.org/W1963595786,"We previously demonstrated that acis-element (−489 to −467) in the brain-specific fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 promoter (FGF-1.B) binds multiple nuclear factors, and this binding enhances transcriptional activity of this promoter. Here we report the isolation of three cDNA clones, VL1, VL2 and VL3, from a human brain stem cDNA expression library using four tandem repeats of the 26-base pair sequence (−492 to −467) as the probe. These cDNA clones represent the variant of bHLH protein E2–2/SEF2–1 in having 12 additional nucleotides encoding the amino acids RSRS. The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of VLl, VL2, and VL3 immunologically react with anti-E2–2 antibody and anti-GST-VL2 antibody. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and methylation interference assay revealed that the GST fusion proteins specifically bind to an imperfect E-box sequence (GACCTG) present in the 26-base pair sequence. Transient expression of the full-length E2–2 without RSRS in U1240MG glioblastoma cells resulted in repression of FGF-1.B promoter activity. We further showed a significant repression of promoter activity (>40 fold) by E2–2 (lacking the amino acid sequence RSRS) when the E47 reporter construct, containing a hexameric E-box site, was used. In contrast, the E2–2 variant containing the RSRS sequence has no significant effect on either the FGF-1 promoter or E47 promoter. These results suggest that the relative abundance of the two splice variants of E2–2 in brain could be an important determinant for the expression of FGF-1.

A family of proteins that bind to a consensus DNA sequence CANNTG, also known as E-box, has been identified. E-box-binding proteins share a common amino acid sequence motif that is proposed to form two amphipathic helices interrupted by a loop, designated the helix-loop-helix (HLH) 1The abbreviations used are: HLH, helix-loop-helix; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; bp, base pair(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase. motif. The HLH domain of these proteins mediates the dimerization, and a basic region located N-terminal of the HLH domain is responsible for DNA binding (1Kadesch T. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar). HLH proteins are mainly of two types, ubiquitous and tissue-specific. The interplay of these HLH proteins is particularly interesting because it plays a significant role in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression (1Kadesch T. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-1 is a prototype member of the structurally related FGF family, which comprises 14 proteins (2Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv. Cancer Res. 1992; 59: 115-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar, 3Smallwood P.M. Munoz-Sanjuan I. Tong P. Macke J.P. Hendry S.H.C. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9850-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). It is found primarily in brain and retina, although low levels of its mRNA have been demonstrated in other tissues (4Chotani M.A. Payson R.A. Winkles J.A. Chiu I.-M.

By in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis, it has been shown that the expression of this growth factor in brain is exclusively in neuronal cells but not in glial cells (7Alam K.Y.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4688-4700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that the expression of FGF-1 mRNA in neurons is correlated with specific developmental events (10Wilcox B.J. Unnerstall J.R. Neuron. 1991; 6: 397-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and that FGF-1 coexists with tyrosine hydroxylase in neuronal cells (11Bean A.J. Elde R. Cao Y. Oellig C. Tamminga C. Goldstein M. Pattersson R.F. Hökfelt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10237-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Importantly, transcription of tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme for catecholamine synthesis, requires both FGF-1 and an activator (12Du X. Stull N.D. Iacovitti L. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7688-7694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-1 mRNA and protein levels were also reported to elevate in lesioned rat brain (13Hara Y. Tooyama I. Yasuhara O. Akiyama H. McGeer P.L. Handa J. Kimura H. Brain Res. 1994; 664: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 14Logan A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 58: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FGF-1 mRNA expression was reported to increase significantly in glioblastoma, the major human intracranial tumor (5Myers R.L. Chedid M. Tronick S.R. Chiu I.-M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 785-789PubMed Google Scholar,15Takahashi J.A. Mori H. Fukumoto M. Igarashi K. Jaye M. Oda Y. Kikuchi H. Hatanaka M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The study of tissue- and cell-specific distribution of FGF-1 transcripts has led to the identification of four different transcripts having the same protein coding exons but different 5′-untranslated exons (16Chiu I.-M. Wang W.-P. Lehtoma K. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 755-762PubMed Google Scholar, 17Payson R.A. Canatan H. Chotani M.A. Wang W.P. Harris S.E. Myers R.L. Chiu I.-M.

FGF-1.B is the predominant transcript in brain, gliomas, and some glioblastoma cell lines (e.g. U1240MG and U251MG) (5Myers R.L. Chedid M. Tronick S.R. Chiu I.-M.

We have identified a 23-bp cis-element (−489 to −467) in FGF-1.B promoter that binds to a 37-kDa protein, p37brn, and this binding is linked to the enhanced functional activity of the promoter (22Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Here we screened a human brain stem cDNA expression library for DNA-binding proteins using a labeled oligonucleotide probe made of four tandem repeats of the sequence −492 to −467. We have isolated and expressed three overlapping cDNA clones. All three clones represent a splice variant of the E2–2 gene product (23Henthron P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the encoded protein binds to an imperfect E-box present in the probe. We further showed that overexpression of an E2–2 variant lacking RSRS represses the transcriptional activities of both the FGF-1.B promoter and the E47 reporter containing a hexameric E-box site. A λgt11 expression library, made from human brain stem as described previously (16Chiu I.-M. Wang W.-P. Lehtoma K. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 755-762PubMed Google Scholar), was screened for expression of DNA-binding proteins using the protocol described by Singh et al. (25Singh H. LeBowitz J.H. Baldwin Jr., A.S Sharp P.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 415-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). ASpeI–BamHI fragment with four tandem repeats of the sequence −492 to −467 (in the head-to-tail orientation) was labeled with [α-32P]dATP by the Klenow reaction and used as a probe. Three positive clones, VL1, VL2, and VL3, were plaque-purified using the same DNA probe. Standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were used to purify the phage DNA, and the cDNA inserts from the phage clones were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II KS(+). The cDNA clones were sequenced using Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). DNA sequence alignment was performed using DNASTAR software (Madison, WI). The VL2 cDNA was used as a probe to hybridize to human multiple-tissue Northern blot (BIOS Laboratories). The Northern blot contained 20 μg of total RNA extracted from different human tissues. The blot was subjected to Northern blot analysis using standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed in a buffer containing 50% formamide at 42 °C for 16 h. The final washes were done in 0.1× SSC at 50 °C for 30 min. The cDNA fragments of 1272, 1037, and 700 bp obtained by EcoRI digestion of VL2, VL3, and VL1 phage clones, respectively, were blunt ended and inserted, in frame with the glutathione S-transferase gene, into blunt endedAvaI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proper orientation of the insert was confirmed by restriction digestion. The GST-fusion proteins were expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli (BL21, pLysS) using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by Smith and Johnson (27Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The purified GST-VL2 protein was used as the antigen for antibody production in rabbits (Cocalico Biologicals, Reamstown, PA). The antibodies were purified by protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) affinity column as described by Harlow and Lane (28Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Anti-E2–2 and anti-E2A antibodies were purchased from Pharmingen. Purified GST fusion proteins of the spliced E2–2 gene products (GST-VL1, GST-VL2, and GST-VL3) and Nalm6 nuclear extract were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For immunodetection, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blocked by 3% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) containing 0.1% Nonidet 40 (Nonidet P-40). The membranes were probed with either monoclonal anti E2–2 antibody or polyclonal anti-GST-VL2 antibody at 1:1000 dilution and washed three times (each for 15 min) with the blocking solution. The blots were then incubated with either horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (for the monoclonal anti-E2–2 antibody) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (for the polyclonal anti-GST-VL2 antibody) at a dilution of 1:1000. Finally, the immunodetection was carried out by autoradiography using ECL kits (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 26-bp (−492 to −467) double-stranded oligonucleotide was end-labeled with [α-32P]dATP using the Klenow enzyme. The sequence was described elsewhere (29Ray S.K. Yang X.-Q. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The binding reaction contained the binding buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 40 mmKCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) with radiolabeled DNA probe (30,000 cpm), 0.2 μg of poly(dI-dC), the GST fusion protein (0.3 μg), and a cold competitor, when desired, in a total volume of 20 μl. The brain nuclear extract (2 μg) was also assayed in EMSA in the presence of 0.1 μg of GST or GST-VL2 under similar conditions except that 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) was used. Following 30 min of incubation at room temperature, the reaction mixture, when indicated, was further incubated with antibody for 1 h at 0 °C. The reaction mix (12 μl) was analyzed in a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE (22.25 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Following electrophoresis, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. The human brain nuclear extract was made in accordance with the method described by Gorski et al.(30Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U.

DNA-protein complexes were separated from the free DNA by EMSA, eluted from the gel, cleaved with piperidine, and then analyzed in 8% sequencing gel as described (22Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). VL3-FL is a full-length E2–2 expression plasmid that was constructed by replacing, in frame, theEcoRV–EcoRI fragment of pCMV2961 (SEF2–1B) (24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the EcoRV-EcoRI fragment from VL3. This replacement allows the resulting construct to encode full-length E2–2/SEF2–1 with four additional amino acids (RSRS) as shown in Fig. 1. The constructs SEF2–1B, pCMVΔCAT, and E47 luciferase reporter (31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Drs. Brit Corneliussen and Thomas Grundström. SEF2–1B, previously designated as pCMV2961, was cloned in the expression vector pCMVΔCAT (24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E47/pCSA, an expression vector for the bHLH protein E47 (32Bain G. Gruenwald S. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3522-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), was provided by Dr. Andrew Lassar (Harvard Medical School, Boston). Plasmid pRL-tk (Promega) contains the sea pansy Renilla luciferase gene driven by the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. The transfection protocols were as described previously (22Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, U1240MG cells were plated in 60-mm Falcon tissue culture dishes (Becton Dickinson Labware) to achieve 60–80% confluence by day 2. On day 2, cells were transfected with the reporter and expression plasmid DNA using the cationic lipid transfection reagent, DOTAP (Boehringer Mannheim). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen plasmid kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA). In each experiment, all constructs were transfected in triplicate. The results show the mean of at least two separate experiments. The luciferase activity was normalized by the protein contents as described (22Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or by the Renilla luciferase activity using the Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer's protocol. Using both functional and biochemical analyses, we previously identified a 26-bp region (−492 to −467) within RR2 of the brain-specific FGF-1.B promoter (22Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Ray S.K. Yang X.-Q. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 26-bp sequence was concatenated, and a probe with four tandem repeats was used to screen a human brain stem cDNA expression library constructed in λgt11 (16Chiu I.-M. Wang W.-P. Lehtoma K. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 755-762PubMed Google Scholar). Two positive clones (VL1 and VL2) were isolated during the first screening, and an additional clone (VL3) was isolated during the second screening. The cDNA inserts from three phage clones were subcloned into pBluescript II KS(+). Sequence analysis showed that the three clones have an identical sequence with E2–2, also known as SEF2–1 and ITF-2, a basic HLH (bHLH) protein which was previously isolated using E-box probes (23Henthron P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both E2–2 (23Henthron P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and one of the four SEF2–1 (24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cDNAs lack four amino acids (RSRS) just upstream of the bHLH region. Using sequence analysis and restriction digestion, we showed that all three of our cDNA clones contain the RSRS sequence (Fig. 1). The difference most likely resulted from alternative splicing of the same E2–2/SEF2–1 gene (23Henthron P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the tissue distribution of E2–2 mRNA, we hybridized Northern blot containing an equal amount of RNA from different human tissues with VL2 cDNA probe. As shown in Fig. 2, the 7.5-kilobase pair human E2–2 transcript is detected in brain (lane 1), lung (lane 4), and to a lesser extent spleen (lane 6). The expression of the 7.5-kilobase transcript in other tissues (e.g. liver, heart, ovary, skeletal muscle, and duodenum) was below the detectable level. It is also noted that the expression of E2–2 mRNA is relatively higher in the brain. In order to characterize the protein encoded by our cDNA clones (VL1, VL2, and VL3), we expressed these cDNAs as GST fusion proteins and raised antibody in rabbit against one of the fusion proteins (GST-VL2) (Fig. 3). The fusion proteins were then tested for the immunoreactivity with the commercially available E2–2 antibody or anti-GST-VL2 antibody. In the same assay, we also included nuclear extract from Nalm6 (pre-B) cell line, which is known to express E2–2 protein (32Bain G. Gruenwald S. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3522-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It is evident from the results that anti-E2–2 antibody recognized GST-VL3 (lane 3) and GST-VL2 (lane 4), but it did not cross-react with GST (lane 1) nor with GST-VL1 (lane 2). Multiple protein bands were observed to cross-react with anti-E2–2 antibody in the case of GST-VL3 or GST-VL2. This could be due to degradation of the fusion proteins or its premature termination of translation. The sizes of the major GST fusion proteins that were recognized by anti-E2–2 antibody for GST-VL2 and for GST-VL3 are similar to the size predicted based on the nucleotide sequence information (Fig. 1). Two major proteins of 90 and 70 kDa (marked in Fig. 3 by the open arrowheads) in nuclear proteins from Nalm6 cells also cross-reacted with the same antibody (lane 5). The nucleotide sequence analyses showed that the three clones reported in this paper are the splice variant of the E2–2 gene. The fact that GST-VL1 was not recognized by anti-E2–2 is probably due to the lack of epitope in this protein that can be recognized by the monoclonal anti-E2–2 antibody. Hence, we repeated the same experiment with anti-GST-VL2 antibody (lanes 6–10). This antibody recognized all the GST fusion proteins (lanes 7–9) and GST itself (lane 6). The same two major polypeptides (90 and 70 kDa) were found to be present in Nalm6 cells that could cross-react with both anti-E2–2 (lane 5, open arrowhead) and anti-GST-VL2 (lane 10, closed arrowhead) antibodies. It is noteworthy to mention that Bainet al. (32Bain G. Gruenwald S. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3522-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) detected a 90-kDa protein in Nalm6 cells cross-reacting with anti-E2–2 antibody. Therefore, it is most likely that the antigenic determinant for anti-GST-VL2 antibody includes both the GST and E2–2 portion of the fusion proteins. We do not know whether the 70-kDa protein is a degradative E2–2 protein or a related protein having the common epitope. These results suggest that the epitope for the anti-E2–2 antibody lies in the 100-amino acid domain encoded by nucleotides 1396–1720, and that VL1, VL2, and VL3 represent the splice variant of E2–2 gene product. To confirm the sequence-specific binding, we performed EMSA using the GST fusion protein and labeled oligonucleotide probe containing the sequence −492 to −467 in the absence or presence of a 50-fold molar excess of cold competitor A (−492 to −467) or B (−484 to −467) (Fig. 4). It is evident that GST-VL1 (lane 1), GST-VL3 (lane 6), and GST-VL2 (lane 11) retarded the migration of the labeled oligonucleotide probe, and the degree of retardation was dependent on the size of the binding protein. It is also clear that these retarded DNA-protein complexes are specific, since they could be competed by the cold competitor A (lanes 2,7, and 12). The lack of competition by the same molar excess of cold competitor B (lanes 3,8, and 13) suggests that the site where these proteins bind resides within the seqence −492 to −484. Interestingly, a closer look of this binding site revealed a sequence ACGACCTGC (29Ray S.K. Yang X.-Q. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) that contains an imperfect E-box (μE5) site, GACCTG (23Henthron P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). To further confirm the identity of these proteins, we added anti-E2–2 or anti-E2A antibody following the DNA-protein complex formation. As shown in Fig. 4, anti-E2–2 antibody supershifted the DNA-protein complex formed either by GST-VL3 (lane 9) or GST-VL2 (lane 14). These supershifts are also specific for the E2–2 antibody, since anti-E2A was unable to supershift the retarded complex (lanes 10 and 15). However, the DNA-protein complex formed by GST-VL1 was not supershifted in the same assay by anti-E2–2 antibody. This result conforms to the earlier data (Fig. 3), which showed that GST-VL1 lacked the epitope to be recognized by anti-E2–2 antibody. However, anti-GST-VL2 could supershift the DNA-protein complex formed with GST-VL1 (Fig. 5,lane 4). The same antibody was also shown to supershift GST-VL3-DNA complex (lane 9). The control antibody (IgG from the same rabbit used to generate anti-GST-VL2) failed to supershift GST-VL1-DNA (lane 5) or GST-VL3-DNA (lane 10) complex.Figure 5Anti-GST-VL2 antibody supershifts the DNA-protein complex formed with GST-VL1 or GST-VL3 in EMSA.Approximately 300 ng of GST-VL1 (lanes 1–5) or GST-VL3 (lanes 6–10) protein was incubated with the labeled oligonucleotide A in the absence (lanes 1 and 6) or presence (lanes 2 and 7) of a 50-fold molar excess of cold competitor A as described in Fig. 4. The identity of protein was tested by an antibody supershift assay using anti-E2–2 antibody (lanes 3 and 8), anti-GST-VL2 antibody (lanes 4 and 9), or control antibody (lanes 5 and10).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the exact contact point in the DNA where these fusion proteins bind, we performed the methylation interference assay using GST-VL2 and the methylated probe as described under “Materials and Methods.” Fig. 6 A shows that the guanine nucleotide in the antisense strand at −484 is important for the binding of this GST fusion protein with the DNA. It is noteworthy to mention that this guanine nucleotide at −484 is in close proximity to the imperfect E-box (μE5) site. Fig. 6 Brepresents the quantitative levels by a comparison of the G-ladder radioactivity of free versus bound. It is also obvious from this analysis that the peak radioactivity at −484 in the bound is significantly reduced (42%) in comparison with the same in the free. To confirm the methylation interference data, we performed EMSA using GST-VL2 and the 26-bp (−492 to −467) oligonucleotide probe having the wild type sequence or having mutation C to A at −484, −478, and −472 (Fig. 7). The binding of GST-VL2 with the mutant probe was reduced dramatically in comparison with that achieved by the wild type probe. Since the binding site of GST-VL2 was identified to be in the region −492 to −484 (Fig. 4), it is most likely that the mutation at −484 caused this diminution of the DNA-protein interaction. Since GST-VL2 binds to the sequence from −492 to −484, we looked for the endogenous E2–2 protein in crude brain nuclear extract that can bind to that site (Fig. 8). Although we could detect one such complex (shown by the open arrowhead,lane 7), it was not recognized by anti-E2–2 antibody (lane 9) or by anti-E2A (lane 10). However, we could detect an additional complex (shown by the solid arrowhead, lane 1) having mobility faster than GST-VL2 (lane 12) when the crude brain nuclear extract was preincubated with GST-VL2. This complex was not formed when the nuclear extract was preincubated with GST under the same conditions (lanes 6–10). Importantly, this additional complex was supershifted by anti-E2–2 antibody (lane 4) but not by the anti-E2A antibody (lane 5). These results suggest that E2–2 forms a heterodimer with partner proteins present in brain and that the heterodimer binds to the site −492 to −484. Two spliced forms of E2–2 proteins, with and without RSRS, are known to be expressed in different cells (23Henthron P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3555-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The three cDNA clones (VL1, VL2, and VL3) isolated from human brain stem cDNA library represent the splice variant of E2–2 containing RSRS (Fig. 1). However, an E2–2 cDNA that lacks the sequence encoding RSRS was isolated from a murine brain cDNA library (33Pscherer A. Dörflinger U. Kirfel J. Gawlas K. Rüschoff J. Buettner R. Schüle R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6680-6690Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Hence, the potential presence of both spliced forms of E2–2 in brain is possible. Considering these facts, we tested the effect of transient overexpression of both spliced forms (with and without RSRS) on the FGF-1.B promoter activity in U1240MG cells (Fig. 9). We observed that SEF2–1B, which encodes full-length E2–2 protein without RSRS (24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), significantly reduced the promoter activity, while the other splice variant with RSRS (VL3-FL) did not affect this promoter activity. Under the same conditions, the empty vector pCMVΔCAT and another bHLH protein NeuroD (35Lee J.E. Hollenebrg S.M. Snider L. Turner D.L. Lipnick N. Weintraub H. Science. 1995; 268: 836-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) did not alter the activity of the FGF-1.B promoter. To determine whether repression of FGF-1.B promoter activity is specific, we tested E47 promoter reporter construct which contains a hexameric E-box (μE5–μE2) site. The reporter activity of this promoter construct was previously shown to increase upon expression of E47 effector cDNA (23Henthron P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 31Corneliussen B. Holm M. Waltersson Y. Onions J. Hallberg B. Thornell A. Grundström T. Nature. 1994; 368: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 32Bain G. Gruenwald S. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3522-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Fig. 10 A shows that the expression plasmid E47/pCSA, encoding E47 protein (an E2A gene product), activated the E47 reporter, and this activation attained a peak level of 27-fold at a 0.5-μg dose in comparison with that achieved by the same dose of the empty vector, pCMVΔCAT. These results suggest that the activation of the promoter through the μE5–μE2 sites is also reproducible in U1240MG cells. On the other hand, at the same dose level and under the similar experimental conditions, SEF2–1B, which encodes the full-length E2–2 protein without RSRS exerted a dramatic inhibition (7-fold) of the promoter activity. This inhibition of the reporter activity was dependent on the dose of this E2–2 splice variant having the repression greater than 40-fold when 5 μg of the SEF2–1B effector plasmid was cotransfected (Fig. 10 A). In contrast, VL3-FL (E2–2 with RSRS) did not confer any remarkable effect on this E47 reporter activity at any of the doses tested (Fig. 10 A). Interestingly, the activity of the FGF-1.B(−540) promoter (containing an imperfect μE5 site at −490 to −485) was also repressed in SEF2–1B-co-transfected cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 10 B). Although the degree of reduction of FGF-1.B promoter activity was not as dramatic as that of E47 reporter, it was reproducible in all five experiments carried out in our laboratory. The transfection of E47/pCSA, on the other hand, did not affect the FGF-1.B promoter activity. These results suggest that the μE5 site present in both promoters may be the target of suppression by E2–2 protein lacking the RSRS domain. The present study was undertaken to identify thetrans-acting factor(s) that binds to RR2 of FGF-1.B promoter. Earlier studies (22Myers R.L. Ray S.K. Eldridge R. Chotani M.A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8257-8266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Ray S.K. Yang X.-Q. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) showed that the specific DNA-protein interaction in a 23-bp sequence (−489 to −467) of RR2 is linked to the enhanced functional activity of the FGF-1.B promoter in the FGF-1.B-positive glioblastoma cell line, U1240MG. The present paper reports the identification of three E2–2/SEF2–1 cDNA clones (VL1, VL2, and VL3) from the brain stem cDNA library using four tandem repeats of the sequence −492 to −467. Comparison of VL1, VL2, and VL3 with the full-length SEF2–1B cDNA (24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6084-6093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that our clones encode four additional amino acids (RSRS) N-terminal to the bHLH domain (Fig. 1). The immunoreactivity of GST fusion proteins of VL1, VL2, and VL3 to the monoclonal anti-E2–2 antibody in Western blot and in EMSA further confirmed that these clones represent a splice variant of the E2–2 gene product. The localization of the binding site by using competitor oligonucleotides of overlapping sequence as well as by methylation interference assay revealed that the protein product of these cDNA clones binds to an imperfect E-box (μE5) site within the sequence −492 to −484. Recently, we showed that the 18-bp sequence (−484 to −467) of FGF-1.B is sufficient to activate the promoter in U1240MG cells (29Ray S.K. Yang X.-Q. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hence, the DNA-protein interaction at the μE5 site may not be essential in the context of FGF-1.B promoter activity in U1240MG cells. On the other hand, this study's findings are important because (i) FGF-1.B is expressed in neuronal cells (7Alam K.Y. Frostholm A. Hackshaw K.V. Evans J.E. Rotter A. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol.

Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar), are also expressed in neuronal cells (35Lee J.E. Hollenebrg S.M. Snider L. Turner D.L. Lipnick N. Weintraub H.

Neuron. 1991; 6: 397-409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the specific binding of these E2–2 proteins (GST-VL1, GST-VL2, and GST-VL3) with the oligonucleotide probe (−492 to −467) was through the imperfect E-box (μE5 site). However, we were unable to detect, by EMSA, cellular E2–2 homodimer either in U1240MG cells (data not shown) or in human brain nuclear extract (Fig. 8) that can bind to the imperfect μE5 site. The Northern blot analysis showed that the steady state levels of SEF2–1 mRNA is relatively higher in brain tissue than in other tissues studied. Therefore, it is unlikely that the level of this protein in the brain tissue is too low to be detectable. However, it is pertinent to mention that protein binding to the μE5 site has not been detected in crude nuclear extract (41Lenardo M. Pierce J.W. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 236: 1573-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 42Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar). We do not know at this point whether our failure to detect the endogenous DNA-protein complex is due to the low affinity of the E2–2 proteins for the imperfect μE5 site or to the fact that the concentration of this protein in crude nuclear extract in a suitable form to bind to this site is too low to be detectable. The former possibility is unlikely, because the fusion of VL1 cDNA with the GAL4 activation domain could activate, in the yeast one-hybrid system (43Wang M.M. Reed R.R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), the minimal histidine promoter containing four tandem repeats of the same DNA binding sequence (−492 to −467) (data not shown). Moreover, the addition of GST-VL2 protein in the brain nuclear extract generated a unique retarded complex (most likely a heterodimer), which can be recognized by the E2–2 antibody (Fig. 8). Given the fact that the 18-bp (−484 to −467) cis-sequence is sufficient to activate the FGF-1.B promoter in normally growing U1240MG cells (29Ray S.K. Yang X.-Q. Chiu I.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7546-7555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the regulation of FGF-1.B promoter activity in other condition (e.g. in neuronal cells at different stages of development) awaits further exploration. In fact, the transfection experiment in U1240MG cells showed that the overexpression of the full-length E2–2 protein lacking the RSRS domain can reduce the activity of an heterologous promoter through μE5–μE2 sites or of FGF-1.B promoter containing the μE5 site. The stretch of the four amino acids, RSRS, is absent in SEF2–1B cDNA obtained from a human thymocyte cDNA library (24Corneliussen B. Thornell A. Hallberg B. Grundström T. J.

This suggests that the brain contains proportionally more E2–2 with RSRS than without RSRS. Although E2–2 has been shown to repress muscle-specific cardiac α-actin promoter activity by heterodimerizing with MyoD (34Skerjanc I.S. Truong J. Filion P. McBurney M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3555-3561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), our observation here represents the first report showing that a splice variant of homodimeric E2–2 (without RSRS) has repressor activity. The mechanism that could discriminate the two splice variants of E2–2 protein (i.e. with or without RSRS) in terms of their effect on the promoter activity through the μE5 site is not known. The possibility of squelching effect through overexpressed SEF2–1B (without RSRS) also has not been ruled out. However, it is interesting to note that RSRS is inside a highly negatively charged stretch of 50 amino acids. In fact, the activation domains of many transcriptional activators are highly negatively charged (44Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence or absence of RSRS inside of the highly negatively charged domain in the E2–2/SEF2–1 protein (encoded by one of the splice variants) could be very important, contributing to the different transcriptional properties of these proteins. It is likely that the relative abundance and dynamic equilibrium of the two splice variants in the brain could be an important determinant for the expression of FGF-1.B. Finally, we showed that in brain nuclear extract, a heterodimer comprising E2–2 binds to the imperfect μE5 site of the FGF-1.B promoter (Fig. 8). It would be of interest to identify the brain-specific bHLH transcription factor that partners with E2–2 or with other bHLH proteins to activate the FGF-1.B gene expression in the brain.

APP is an integral membrane protein with a short intracellular carboxyl terminus. Normal proteolytic processing of APP generates two fragments, a large extracellular amino-terminal domain (sAPPα) and a truncated carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTFα), both of which are products of cleavage within the Aβ domain. Another form of proteolytic processing occurring at β-site(s) gives rise to limited production of carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFβ) and Aβ in unidentified intracellular compartments of the protein secretory pathway (14Haass S. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that the α-secretase responsible for cleavage of APP at the α-site is active in the trans-Golgi network or other end-stage compartments of the protein secretory pathway (15De Strooper B. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Kuentzel S.L. Ali S.M. Altman R.A. Greenberg B.D. Raub T.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing the APP of familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD), such as APP with the “Swedish” double mutation (K595N/M596L, numbering for the APP695 isoform), suggest that APP cleavage at the β-site by β-secretase occurs in themedial-Golgi network and in unidentified compartments proximal to the plasma membrane (17Perez R.G.

Bieger S.C. Brühl B. Tienari P.J. Ida N. Allsop D. Roberts G.W. Masters C.L. Dotti C.G. Unsicker K. Beyreuther K. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is generally held that the increased production of CTFβ always gives rise to more Aβ, although the molecular mechanisms of CTFβ production by β-secretase from wild-type APP and of subsequent Aβ production following the cleavage of CTFβ by γ-secretase are still unknown in sporadic AD patients, who constitute the majority of AD cases. The APP cytoplasmic domain is thought to be responsible for the intracellular transport of APP. Two internalization signals, NPTY (APP770 amino acids 759–762 and APP695 amino acids 684–687) and YTSI (APP770 amino acids 728–731 and APP695 amino acids 653–656), have been identified (20Norstedt C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The NPXY motif in the cytoplasmic domain of membrane proteins is believed to mediate interactions between internalized proteins and the clathrin cage of the clathrin-coated vesicle (22Pearse B.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The YXXI motif conforms to a potential 4-residue tyrosine-based internalization signal consensus sequence (21Lai A. Sisodia S.S. Trowbridge I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3565-3573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sorting signal(s) in the cytoplasmic domain of APP are thought to play an important role in the distribution of APP within the protein secretory pathway (15De Strooper B. Umans L. Van Leuven F. Van Den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), although the sorting signal has not been well analyzed. Therefore, using site-directed mutagenesis, we performed further analysis of the sorting signal(s) in the cytoplasmic domain of APP, which may be responsible for the regulation of APP metabolism such as the production of CTFβ and/or Aβ. Identification and characterization of the signal(s) in the APP cytoplasmic domain are important for our understanding of the molecular mechanism that directs APP into a protein secretory pathway where CTFβ and/or subsequent Aβ production occurs without an FAD mutation. In this study, we introduced an alanine-scanning mutation into the cytoplasmic domain of APP and established many cell lines that expressed stably transfected APP carrying a single amino acid mutation in its cytoplasmic domain. Among the cell lines, cells that expressed APP carrying a mutation at amino acid 747 of APP770 (position 672 of APP695) generated a greater amount of CTFβ, but this did not result in an increase of Aβ secretion, indicating that the intracellular increase in CTFβ is not necessarily related to an increase in Aβ production. This effect was not due to a simple intracellular accumulation of CTFβ resulting from a lack of γ-secretase. These results suggest that the basic amino acid at position 747 of APP770 (position 672 of APP695) plays an important role in the direction of APP into the normal secretory pathway, in which APP is cleaved preferentially at the α-site. Thus, APP carrying this mutation may be metabolized in a different protein secretory pathway distinct from the normal one. Our findings provide a new insight into what regulates the processing of CTFβ by γ-secretase and the nature of the compartment in which γ-secretase cleavage occurs in the case of sporadic AD."

In this report the overexpression of the genes for the carboxyltransferase component is described. The steady-state kinetics of the recombinant carboxyltransferase are characterized in the reverse direction, in which malonyl-CoA reacts with biocytin to form acetyl-CoA and carboxybiocytin. The initial velocity patterns indicated that the kinetic mechanism is equilibrium-ordered with malonyl-CoA binding before biocytin and the binding of malonyl-CoA to carboxyltransferase at equilibrium. The biotin analogs, desthiobiotin and 2-imidazolidone, inhibited carboxyltransferase. Both analogs exhibited parabolic noncompetitive inhibition, which means that two molecules of inhibitor bind to the enzyme. The pH dependence for both the maximum velocity (V) and the (V/K)biocytinparameters decreased at low pH. A single ionizing group on the enzyme with a pK of 6.2 or lower in the (V/K)biocytin profile and 7.5 in theV profile must be unprotonated for catalysis. Carboxyltransferase was inactivated by N-ethylmaleimide, whereas malonyl-CoA protected against inactivation. This suggests that a thiol in or near the active site is needed for catalysis.

The enzyme is found in all animals, plants, and bacteria and catalyzes the biotin-dependent carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA in the two steps of Reaction 1.

Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biotin carboxylase catalyzes the first half-reaction in which biotin is carboxylated to form carboxybiotin. Carboxyltransferase catalyzes the second half-reaction where the carboxyl group is transferred from biotin to acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA. Both biotin carboxylase and the carrier protein are homodimers, whereas the carboxyltransferase component is an α2β2 tetramer. Each of the three components can be isolated separately, and the biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase components retain catalytic activity in the absence of the other two components. Moreover, biotin carboxylase and carboxyltransferase will utilize free biotin as a substrate, which makes them ideal model systems for studying mechanistic aspects of biotin-dependent enzymes. Most mechanistic studies of acetyl-CoA carboxylase have focused on the biotin carboxylase component because the gene for the enzyme has been cloned and overexpressed (3Li S.-J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 855-863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a three-dimensional structure of biotin carboxylase has been determined by x-ray crystallography (4Waldrop G.L. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10249-10256Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast, virtually no mechanistic studies have been done on carboxyltransferase for more than 20 years because despite cloning of the genes for carboxyltransferase (5Li S.-J. Cronan Jr., J.E. J.

As a result, it has been difficult to obtain sufficient amounts of protein for kinetic, structural, and site-directed mutagenesis studies. In this report we describe the overexpression of the genes for carboxyltransferase, purification, and kinetic characterization of the recombinant enzyme including the kinetic mechanism, inhibition and chemical modification studies, and the pH dependence of the reaction. Structural and mechanistic studies of this enzyme may lend insight into the design of better inhibitors because the carboxyltransferase component is the site of action in plant acetyl-CoA carboxylase for several herbicides (8Gronwald J.W.

The expression vector, pET14b, and the host strain, E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, were from Novagen. The Wizard kit for plasmid isolation and purification was from Promega. All restriction enzymes, dNTPs, deep vent polymerase, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Primers were synthesized by Life Technologies Inc. A Sequenase Quick-Denature plasmid sequencing kit with sequenase version 2.0 was from Amersham Promega Biotech. His-binding resin, columns, and protocol were from Novagen. All other reagents were from Sigma. The steps used to construct the expression vectors pCZB4 and pCZB5 are summarized in Fig. 1. The gene for the α subunit of carboxyltransferase, designated accA, was contained on pLS181, which was obtained from Dr. John Cronan, University of Illinois. The gene for the β subunit of carboxyltransferase, designated accD, was contained on pCS, which was obtained from Dr. Dean Tolan, Boston University. The accA gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using the primers (5′-CCG CTC GAG TTC TCC TTA CGC GTA ACC GTA GCT CAT CAG GCG) and (5′-GGA ATT CCA TAT GAG TCT GAA TTT CCT TGA TTT TGA A), which incorporated the restriction sites EcoRI,NdeI and XhoI and a ribosome binding site into the 959-base pair amplified fragment. The accD gene was amplified using the primers (5′-CGG GAT CCT CAG GCC TCA GGT TCC TGA TCC GGT AC-3′) and (5′-CCG CTC GAG ATG AGC TGG ATT GAA CGA ATT AAA AGC-3′), which incorporated the restriction sites XhoI andBamHI into the 899-base pair amplified fragment. Polymerase chain reaction cycling conditions were as follows: melting, 1 min at 94 °C; annealing, 1 min at 55 °C; and extension, 1.5 min at 72 °C for 40 cycles. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with EcoRI andXhoI in the case of accA and XhoI andBamHI in the case of accD using conditions recommended by the enzyme supplier (New England Biolabs). TheaccA and accD fragments were then ligated to similarly digested pGem-11zf to generate plasmids pCZB2 and pCZB1, respectively. pCZB1 was digested with the restriction enzymesXhoI and BamHI, and the 0.9-kilobase fragment containing accD was isolated by DNA gel electrophoresis. The 0.9-kilobase fragment containing accD was then ligated to similarly digested pCZB2 resulting in a new plasmid, pCZB3, containing both accA and accD. accA andaccD were subcloned out of pCZB3 and into pET22b and pET14b with the restriction enzymes NdeI and BamHI to produce the vectors pCZB4 and pCZB5, respectively. pCZB5 contains a His-tag sequence that allows for expression of carboxyltransferase with a 20-amino acid His-tag (Novagen) fused to the amino terminus of the α subunit. pCZB4 and pCZB5 were transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS, which contains a chromosomal copy of the T7 RNA polymerase gene under the control of the lacUV5 promoter. Bacteria were grown in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. A fresh overnight culture from a single colony was used to inoculate 0.5 liter of medium (50 ml in 10 125-ml Erlenmeyer flasks). Attempts to do growths in 2-liter flasks resulted in an increase in insoluble protein. The cultures were grown at 37 °C until A 600reached 0.60–0.70, then lactose was added to a final concentration of 28 mm. The temperature was decreased to 30 °C upon induction, and the cultures were incubated an additional 2.5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell paste from 0.5 liter of culture was suspended in 20 ml of binding buffer (50 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9) and lysed by the freeze-thaw method. His-binding resin was used for rapid one-step affinity purification of carboxyltransferase containing the His-tag sequence. The protocol recommended by Novagen for His-tag protein purification was followed except that carboxyltransferase was eluted from the 2.5-ml His-tag columns with a solution of 170 mmimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 120 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9. The protein solution was dialyzed overnight against 0.67 mmEDTA, 10 mm KHPO4, pH 7.0, and then dialyzed overnight against 500 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. Carboxyltransferase was concentrated by placing dialysis tubing containing the enzyme in a container and covering the tubing with polyvinylpyrrolidone. Freezing of carboxyltransferase was found to cause irreversible precipitation/denaturation, therefore all protein solutions were stored at 4 °C. Carboxyltransferase activity was measured in the reverse direction with a spectrophotometric assay in which the production of acetyl-CoA was coupled to the combined citrate synthase-malate dehydrogenase reaction requiring NAD+ reduction (10Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Lane M.D. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 32-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 10 mml-malate, 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3.6 units/ml malic dehydrogenase, 6.8 units/ml citrate synthase. For inhibition studies with desthiobiotin, the ionic strength was held constant by the addition of KCl. pH studies were done in a three-component buffer system of 0.1 mMes, 1The abbreviations used are: Mes, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; NEM, N-methylmaleimide; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. 0.051 m N-ethylmorpholine, and 0.051 m diethanolamine. Over the pH range of 6.2–9.6, for which the initial velocities were measured, the ionic strength of the buffer mixture remained constant at a value of 0.1 m (11Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Data were collected using a Uvikon 810 (Kontron Instruments) spectrophotometer interfaced to a PC equipped with a data acquisition program. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C by a circulating water bath with the capacity to heat and cool the thermospace of the cell compartment. NADH formation was followed spectrophotometrically at 340 nm. Specific activity is expressed as μmol/min/mg of carboxyltransferase. A diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC) stock solution was prepared in anhydrous ethanol and used within a few hours. The concentration of the stock solution was determined by measuring the change in the absorbance at 230 nm when an aliquot was added to a solution of 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and using an extinction coefficient of 3000 m−1cm−1 for the resulting N-carbethoxyimidazole product (12Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Enzyme modifications by DEPC and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) were performed in 10 mm Hepes, 500 mm KCl, pH 7.0. The reactions were initiated by the addition of one of the inactivators to the carboxyltransferase solution. Aliquots were removed at regular time intervals and assayed for remaining activity. Aliquots were of sufficiently small volume compared with the assay volume such that the inactivating reagent was diluted 100-fold. NEM and DEPC were used at 4 and 1 mm, respectively. The protection by either malonyl-CoA or biocytin or both was assayed by incubating the protective agent with the enzyme in 10 mm Hepes, 500 mm KCl, pH 7.0, for 2 min before adding the inactivating agent. The pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of carboxyltransferase by NEM was not determined in the tripart buffer system used for the rate profiles because of inactivation of NEM by diethanolamine. The buffer system used was Mes, pH 6.2–6.5, Pipes, pH 6.5–7.0, Hepes, pH 7.0–8.0. Data were fitted to the appropriate equation using either the computer program Enzfitter or the computer programs of Cleland (13Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1924) Google Scholar). Initial velocities obtained by varying one of the substrates (A) were substituted in Equation 1 to yield values for the maximum velocity (V) and the Michaelis constant for the substrate (K). v=VA/(K+A)Equation 1 When one substrate was varied at fixed levels of the other, velocity data were fitted to Equation 2, which describes the equilibrium-ordered initial velocity pattern, where v is the experimentally determined velocity, V is the maximum velocity, A and B are the substrate concentrations,K a and Kb are the respective Michaelis constants, and Kia is the dissociation constant of A. v=VAB/(KiaKb+KbA+AB)Equation 2 Data conforming to parabolic noncompetitive inhibition were fitted to Equation 3, v=VA/(K(1+I/Kis1+I2/Kis2)+A(1+I/Kii1+I2/Kii2))Equation 3 in which I is the inhibitor concentration; Kis1 and Kis2 are the slope inhibition constants for site 1 and 2, respectively; and Kii1 and Kii2 are the intercept inhibition constants for site 1 and 2, respectively. The variation of the values for V, V/K, andk, the rate of inactivation of carboxyltransferase by NEM as a function of pH were fitted to the log form of Equation 4. In this equation y represents the value of V orV/K at a particular pH value, C represents the pH-independent value of the parameter; K a is an acid dissociation constant, and H is the hydrogen ion concentration. y=C/(1+H/KA)Equation 4 The genes for the α and β subunits of carboxyltransferase are not contiguous on the E. coli genome, yet they are presumably expressed stoichiometrically to give the α2β2 tetramer of carboxyltransferase. Therefore, an overexpression system needed to be developed such that the genes for the α and β subunits were contiguous and expressed stoichiometrically. The gene for the α subunit was expressed using the ribosomal binding site from the pET vector. Thus, what was needed was an intercistronic region that allowed for efficient expression of the gene for the β subunit. To accomplish this, a 12-base pair intercistronic region that was very similar to that found between the genes for the catalytic and regulatory subunits of E. coliaspartate transcarbamylase was used (14Yang Y.R. Schachman H.K. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Like carboxyltransferase, aspartate transcarbamylase is composed of two different subunits, a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. The genes for each subunit are contiguous on the E. coli genome and are expressed stoichiometrically so that intact aspartate transcarbamylase is composed of six catalytic subunits and six regulatory subunits. The 12-base pair intercistronic region that was incorporated between the genes for the α and β subunits of carboxyltransferase contains a ribosomal binding site and an XhoI site and allowed the gene for the β subunit to be co-overexpressed with the α subunit. When bacteria containing pCZB5 (Fig. 1) were grown at 37 °C after induction, the genes for both the α and β subunit were expressed very well. Unfortunately, the enzyme was found in inclusion bodies. To obtain enzyme in the soluble fraction, bacteria were grown at 30 °C after induction. His-tag carboxyltransferase was purified to apparent homogeneity using a nickel column (Fig. 2), and control experiments verified that the native carboxyltransferase did not bind to the nickel column. The average yield of carboxyltransferase was 6 mg from 3 g of E. coli cells. In contrast, it takes 2 kg of E. coli cells to obtain 6 mg of carboxyltransferase when the genes are not overexpressed (2Guchhait R.B. Polakis S.E. Dimroth P. Stoll E. Moss J. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6633-6645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to remove the His-tag from carboxyltransferase by treatment with thrombin resulted in complete degradation of the α subunit. Because the presence of the His-tag did not hinder the catalytic ability of the enzyme, the His-tag carboxyltransferase was left intact. The α and β genes for carboxyltransferase were sequenced and compared with published sequences to ensure that the polymerase chain reaction did not introduce any mutations (5Li S.-J. Cronan Jr., J.E.

The kinetic parameters for carboxyltransferase-catalyzed transcarboxylation from malonyl-CoA to biotin and two biotin analogs are shown in Table I. Biotin methyl ester and biocytin had maximal velocities 3 orders of magnitude higher than biotin. Biocytin is biotin with lysine attached to the carboxyl group of the valeric acid side chain via an amide linkage with the ε-amino group (Fig. 3). Because biotin reacted considerably slower than the other two analogs and biotin methyl ester had to be dissolved in dimethylformamide, all of the subsequent studies utilized biocytin as substrate.Table IValues of kinetic parameters for biotin and biotin analogsSubstratesK mV maxmmμmol/min · mgd-Biotin2.2 ± 0.30.040 ± 0.003Biotin methyl ester (DMF)19.3 ± 2.025.3 ± 1.2Biocytin8.25 ± 0.0322.40 ± 0.03Transcarboxylation rates were determined as described under “Materials and Methods”; the K m of each substrate was determined at a fixed concentration of malonyl-CoA, 0.1 mm.

K m is in mm,V max is in μmol/min·mg. DMF stands for dimethylformamide. The kinetic mechanism of carboxyltransferase was investigated by determining the initial velocity pattern. When malonyl-CoA was varied at several fixed levels of biocytin an intersecting pattern was obtained, indicating the sequential addition of malonyl-CoA and biocytin prior to product release (Fig. 4A). When biocytin was varied at several fixed levels of malonyl-CoA the pattern was intersecting; however, the intersection point was on the vertical axis (Fig. 4B). A replot of the slopes of the data versus the reciprocal of the biocytin concentration when malonyl-CoA was varied went through zero. These data indicate an ordered addition of substrates to the enzyme with malonyl-CoA binding before biocytin with the binding of malonyl-CoA to the enzyme at equilibrium. The data fit best to Equation 2 to yield the binding constant of malonyl-CoA to the enzyme, Kiamalonyl-CoA = 0.10 ± 0.01 mm, the Michaelis constant for biocytin, Kbiocytin = 6.3 ± 0.7 mm and the maximum velocity of the reactionV = 19.6 ± 0.9 μmol/min/mg. The biotin analogs desthiobiotin and 2-imidazolidone (Fig. 3) were found to inhibit the activity of carboxyltransferase. Polakis et al. (15Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Zwergel E.E. Lane M.D. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6657-6667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) determined that desthiobiotin and 2-imidazolidone were not alternate substrates for carboxyltransferase so the observed inhibition is the result of formation of a dead-end complex between the inhibitor and the enzyme. Reciprocal plots of the velocity versus biocytin at various concentrations of desthiobiotin gave noncompetitive inhibition (Fig. 5). Replots of both the slopes and intercepts versus the desthiobiotin concentration resulted in parabola-shaped curves. Because the replots of the slopes and intercepts versus the desthiobiotin concentration were both parabolic the data were fitted to an equation that describes noncompetitive inhibition where both the slopes and intercepts are parabolic functions of the inhibitor concentration (Equation 3). For comparison the data were also fitted to equations that describe noncompetitive inhibition where only the slope or the intercept is a parabolic function of inhibitor concentration. The data fit best to Equation 3 based on the fact that the average least squares of the residuals was the lowest for Equation 3. The inhibition constants for the two inhibitor binding sites are given in TableII. The fact that the inhibition data conform to parabolic noncompetitive inhibition means that two molecules of desthiobiotin bind to the enzyme simultaneously.Table IIInhibition constants for biotin analogsInhibition constantsInhibitorDesthiobiotin2-ImidazolidonemmK is10.054 ± 0.0191.1 ± 0.5K is22.9 ± 1.01.2 ± 0.6K ii10.27 ± 0.5538 ± 520K ii23.2 ± 1.41.4 ± 0.9The error for the inhibition constants is the standard error.

Open table in a new tab The error for the inhibition constants is the standard error. It was derived from the nonlinear regression analysis and was calculated from the square root of the variance of the parameter (22Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. 1967; 29: 1-32PubMed Google Scholar). The biotin analog 2-imidazolidone also acted as a parabolic noncompetitive inhibitor of carboxyltransferase, although it was a much worse inhibitor than desthiobiotin. The inhibition constants are given in Table II. It should be noted that although 2-imidazolidone is not an alternate substrate, it was found to stimulate the decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA (15Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Zwergel E.E. Lane M.D. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6657-6667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the rates of decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA at each level of 2-imidazolidone were subtracted from the velocities obtained in the presence of biocytin. The rate of decarboxylation of malonyl-CoA by 2-imidazolidone was 5% or less of the rate of carboxyl group transfer. The effect of pH on the carboxyltransferase reaction was determined over the pH range of 6.2–9.6 by varying the biocytin concentrations at a saturating fixed level of malonyl-CoA. Under these conditions, the reaction examined was that of biocytin with the enzyme malonyl-CoA complex. As shown in Fig. 6, both logV and log (V/K)biocytin decreased with decreasing pH, although the (V/K)biocytinonly decreased 2-fold. Fitting the data to Equation 4 yielded a pK of 7.52 ± 0.10 for the V profile and 6.21 ± 0.10 for the V/K profile. However, because data could not be obtained below pH 6.2 due to enzyme instability, the pK value in the V/K profile can only be estimated to be 6.2 or less. DEPC reacts preferentially with histidine residues to yield an N-carbethoxyhistidyl derivative (12Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Incubation of carboxyltransferase with 1 mm DEPC resulted in a time-dependent loss in activity with a pseudo-first order rate constant of 0.09 min−1. However, neither biocytin nor malonyl-CoA provided significant protection against DEPC inactivation, indicating that the histidine is probably not in the active site. Modification of the poly-His-tag by DEPC is not occurring because nickel sulfate did not protect against the modification. Carboxyltransferase was found to be susceptible to inactivation by the sulfhydryl-modifying reagent NEM. NEM (4 mm) inactivated carboxyltransferase with a pseudo-first order rate constant of 0.06 min−1. In the presence of 330 μmmalonyl-CoA, almost complete protection (90%) against inactivation by NEM was observed. Biocytin provided no protection against inactivation by NEM. The rate of inactivation of carboxyltransferase by NEM decreased with decreasing pH (Fig. 7). Fitting the data to Equation 4 yielded a pK value of 7.32 ± 0.16. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase plays a critical role in metabolism in that it catalyzes the committed and regulated reaction in the synthesis of long chain fatty acids. The metabolic significance of this enzyme is evident from the fact that inhibitors directed against the plant or mammalian form of the enzyme can be either herbicides or plasma lipid-lowering drugs. These agents work by inhibiting the carboxyltransferase component of acetyl-CoA carboxylase. Despite the apparent importance of acetyl-CoA carboxylase to agriculture and medicine, very little work has been done on the carboxyltransferase component, presumably because there has never been an adequate source of the enzyme. With the overexpression system described here significant amounts of protein have been obtained, allowing for a more rigorous characterization of carboxyltransferase than has been done previously (15Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Zwergel E.E. Lane M.D. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 6657-6667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major experimental problem with site-directed mutagenesis studies ofE. coli enzymes is contamination of the mutant enzyme with wild-type enzyme derived from the chromosomal copy of the gene. In most cases this problem can be overcome by removing the chromosomal copy of the gene. If the enzyme is involved in an essential metabolic pathway, then for mutant enzymes with very little to no activity, a metabolic intermediate subsequent to the step in question can be added to the culture medium to sustain bacterial growth. Unfortunately, none of the metabolic intermediates after the step catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase are transported into E. coli. Because fatty acid synthesis is essential for bacterial growth, it would be impossible to remove the chromosomal copy of carboxyltransferase and sustain bacterial growth while overexpressing a mutant form of carboxyltransferase with very little to no activity. Because one of the uses of the overexpression system for carboxyltransferase will be for production of mutant enzymes, the genes for the α and β subunits of carboxyltransferase were subcloned into pET14b to produce the expression vector pCZB5 (Fig. 1). Using this expression vector carboxyltransferase is produced with a His-tag sequence fused to the NH2 terminus of the α subunit which allows the enzyme to be purified by affinity chromatography using a nickel column. The chromosomal copy of the enzyme, which lacks the His-tag sequence, does not bind to the nickel column. Therefore, the His-tag version of carboxyltransferase was purified and characterized to lay the groundwork for future site-directed mutagenesis studies. The intersecting initial velocity pattern when malonyl-CoA and biocytin are varied indicates that the kinetic mechanism of carboxyltransferase is sequential. That the lines intersected on the 1/v axis when biocytin was varied at several fixed levels of malonyl-CoA (Fig. 4 B) and that a replot of the slopes of the dataversus the reciprocal of the biocytin concentration went through zero suggest that the kinetic mechanism is equilibrium-ordered with malonyl-CoA binding before biocytin and the binding of malonyl-CoA at equilibrium. An equilibrium-ordered pattern means that the biocytin does not form a binary complex with the enzyme but only combines with the enzyme-malonyl-CoA complex. Dead-end inhibition studies would be extremely helpful to define further the kinetic mechanism. However, no suitable inhibitor was found. Because the assay for carboxyltransferase involves detecting the production of acetyl-CoA using citrate synthase, the inhibition studies precluded the use of CoA analogs and thus were limited to analogs of biotin. Although not very informative mechanistically, inhibition by two analogs of biotin proved very interesting and worth noting. Both desthiobiotin and 2-imidazolidone were parabolic noncompetitive inhibitors of the carboxyltransferase reaction when either biocytin or malonyl-CoA was varied. In the case of dead-end inhibitors like desthiobiotin and 2-imidazolidone, parabolic noncompetitive inhibition occurs only when two molecules of the inhibitor bind to the enzyme(16Cleland W.W. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. Vol. 2. Academic Press, New York1970Google Scholar). One inhibitor site (site 1) may be at or near the binding site for biocytin, and the second inhibitor is probably at another location on the enzyme (site 2) because saturating amounts of substrate do not relieve inhibition totally. This interpretation would help to explain why the error for the inhibition constant for site 1 at saturating levels of substrate (K ii1) is greater than the parameter. Also, it is not clear why there is a second inhibitor binding site. It should be noted, however, that the carboxyltransferase component of E. coli acetyl-CoA carboxylase is inhibited by guanosine 5′-diphosphate-3′-diphosphate (ppGpp) and guanosine 5′-triphosphate-3′-diphosphate (pppGpp) (17Polakis S.E. Guchhait R.B. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 7957-7966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These nucleotides have been shown to inhibit RNA synthesis during amino acid starvation in what is referred to as the stringent response (18Lazzarini R.A. Cashel M. Gallant J. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4381-4385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid synthesis is also reduced during amino acid starvation. The decrease in fatty acid synthesis is thought to be mediated by inhibition of carboxyltransferase by ppGpp and pppGpp. The second inhibitor site on carboxyltransferase may be the same site at which ppGpp and pppGpp bind to regulate fatty acid synthesis. The pH dependence of the carboxyltransferase reaction suggests that an enzymic residue acts as a base in catalysis. The activity for both the log V and the log (V/K)biocytinparameters decreased at low pH indicating that a group must be deprotonated for activity. The group has a pK value of 7.5 in the V profile. The V profile indicates the pK values of groups in the enzyme substrate complex that are required for catalysis. Thus, it is very probable that the observed base acts in a catalytic role because it is found in the Vprofile. The inactivation of carboxyltransferase by NEM and the protection against inactivation by malonyl-CoA suggest that an active site cysteine residue is needed for catalysis. Like the pH dependence of theV and V/K parameters, the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of carboxyltransferase by NEM decreased with decreasing pH. The pK value derived from the pH dependence of inactivation (7.32 ± 0.16) was, within error, the same as the pK value seen in the V profile (7.52 ± 0.10). Thus, given the similarity of the pH rate profiles and the pH dependence of the rate of inactivation of carboxyltransferase by NEM it is plausible that the residue that must be deprotonated for activity is a cysteine. The reverse reaction of carboxyltransferase requires an activated biocytin molecule that has the proton removed from the 1′-nitrogen prior to carboxylation. The thiolate ion of the cysteine suggested above may be the catalytic base that abstracts the N1′ proton of biocytin. It has been proposed that the thiolate ion of cysteine abstracts the N1′ proton of biotin in biotin carboxylase (19Tipton P.A. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4317-4325Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and pyruvate carboxylase (20Attwood P.V. Tipton P.A. Cleland W.W.

Verification of this mechanism in terms of which cysteine residue is involved would be aided greatly by a three-dimensional structure of carboxyltransferase followed by site-directed mutagenesis studies. To this end, overexpression of the gene for carboxyltransferase now provides us with ample amounts of enzyme for structure/function studies such as crystallography and site-directed mutagenesis experiments. The His-tag carboxyltransferase allows mutant enzyme to be separated from the wild-type chromosomal copy so that there are no ambiguities in the interpretation of the kinetics of the mutant enzyme. And finally, crystals of the carboxyltransferase have been obtained and the crystal structure determination is currently underway.

Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 228-230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The regulation of phosphorylation is controlled by a large number of protein kinases which are grouped into different categories depending on the activating signals, the substrates which become phosphorylated by these kinases, and the specific amino acid residues that become phosphorylated (5Hunter T. Cell. 1987; 50: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar, 6Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3826) Google Scholar).

The activity of this class of kinases is dependent on Ca2+, but independent of calmodulin, and the enzyme has been purified from a number of plant species (11Harmon A.C. Putnam-Evans C. Cormier M.J.

Besides Ca2+, the phosphatidylinositol cycle has been shown to be involved in signal transduction (22Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 159-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2455) Google Scholar). The receptor-mediated hydrolysis of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate by phospholipase C (PLC) results in the generation of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Inositol trisphosphate releases Ca2+from internal stores, whereas DAG transduces signals via the activation of PKC, an enzyme belonging to the class of serine/threonine kinases (23Asaoka Y. Nakamura S. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 414-417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 24Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 334: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar). Protein kinase C is also activated by the tumor-promoting phorbol esters (25Parker P.J. Coussens L. Totty N. Rhee L. Young S.

The PKC gene family contains at least 10 different isozymes with different activation requirements, subcellular distributions, and substrate specificities (27Pears C. J. Biosci. 1995; 20: 311-332Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In recent years, the involvement of the phosphatidylinositol cycle in a variety of plant signal responses has been demonstrated (19Drobak B.K. Smallwood M. Knox J.P. Bowles D.J. Membranes: Specialized Functions in Plants. BIOS Scientific Publishers, Oxford, UK1996: 195-214Google Scholar). However, the characterization of PKC is still lacking. A number of reports confirms the existence of such kinases in plants. The presence of a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent kinase was first shown in cytosolic fractions of zucchini (28Schäfer A. Bygrave F. Matzenauer S. Marme D. FEBS Lett. 1985; 187: 35-38Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Later such kinases were reported from oat (29Schaller G.E. Harmon A.C. Sussman M.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1721-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and the chloroplast envelope (30Muto S. Shimogawara K. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 88-92Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The presence of PKC was also shown by using partially purified fractions from Amarnthus tricolor (31Elliot D.C. Kokke Y.S. Phytochemistry. 1987; 26: 2929-2935Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Elliot D.C. Kokke Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1987; 145: 1043-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and rice (33Morello L. Giani S. Oraggio I. Breviario D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by using antibodies raised against the animal enzyme. In rice an enzyme fraction was found to phosphorylate a specific PKC substrate, MARCKS, and this enzyme activity was inhibited by staurosporine and calphostine (33Morello L. Giani S. Oraggio I. Breviario D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the same system, Komatsu and Hirano (34Komatsu S. Hirano H. Plant Sci. 1993; 94: 127-137Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) found a staurosporine-inhibited kinase activity. They further characterized a Ca2+-, PS-, and PMA-stimulated kinase activity, and the phosphorylation of 45- and 43-kDa polypeptides was increased by PMA. Earlier, in wheat, a lipid- and PMA-stimulated kinase was reported (35Olah Z. Kiss Z. FEBS Lett. 1986; 195: 33-37Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A partially purified kinase activity was also obtained fromBrassica compestris and maize, and both of them were stimulated by Ca2+, PS, and OAG or PMA (36Namori T. Taguaki W. Kinugasa M. Oji Y. Sahara S. Fukami Y. Kikkawa U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 311-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 37Chandok M.R. Sopory S.K. J. Plant Biochem. Biotech. 1996; 5: 7-11Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The presence of a PKC equivalent enzyme is also supported by the presence of PKC inhibitors (38Simpson G.G. Clark G. Brown J.W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1222: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 39Chen Z. Fu H. Liu D. Chang P.L. Narasimhan M. Ferl R. Hasegawa P.M. Bressan R. Plant J. 1994; 6: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The isolation of a DAG kinase gene and the identification of PLC further suggested the existence of PKC in plants (40Katagiri T. Mizoguexi T. Shinzaki K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 301: 647-653Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of PKC in higher plants has been indicated either by demonstrating the stimulation of partially purified enzyme fractions by Ca2+ and phospholipids or by immunoblotting with antibodies raised against animal PKC. However, the purification and detailed biochemical analyses of the lipid-stimulated kinases in the plants are still lacking. We have shown earlier that serotonin, an activator of phosphatidylinositol cycle and PMA could replace the requirement of light for the induction of nitrate reductase (NR) transcripts and enzyme activities in maize. A PKC equivalent enzyme activity was partially purified (41Chandok M.R. Sopory S.K. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 2255-2258Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 42Chandok M.R. Sopory S.K. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 43Chandok M.R. Sopory S.K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 44Raghuram N. Sopory S.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 45Sopory S.K. Chandok M.R. Biswas B.B. Biswas S. Subcellular Biochemistry. 26. Plenum Press, New York1996: 345-364Google Scholar). In this paper we report the purification of a PKC-type kinase to homogeneity, its partial characterization, and the production of polyclonal antibodies against the first plant PKC. We further demonstrate that the PKC level is regulated by PMA, a chemical which also stimulated the nitrate reductase transcript level. Seeds of Zea mays var. Ganga-5 were obtained from National Seed Corp., New Delhi, India and were grown on germination paper at 25 ± 1 °C in complete darkness. PMA treatments were given to excised etiolated leaves as described earlier (41Chandok M.R. Sopory S.K. Phytochemistry. 1992; 31: 2255-2258Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PS, OAG, HEPES, histone, PMA, 4α-PMA, Tris, MES, BCIP, HRP conjugate, and o-phenylenediamine were purchased from Sigma. [3H]PMA was purchased from NEN Life Science Products, [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]ATP from Bhabha Atomic (BARC), Bombay, India. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Unless mentioned otherwise all steps of protein purification were carried out at 4 °C. Etiolated leaves were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol. The homogenate was first centrifuged at 15,000 rpm in RPR 20-2 rotor using a Hitachi centrifuge for 30 min and then at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The final supernatant was loaded onto DEAE-Sephacel (80–100 ml) in a Bio-Rad column pre-equilibrated with equilibration buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mmDTT, 2 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol) as reported earlier (37Chandok M.R. Sopory S.K. J. Plant Biochem. Biotech. 1996; 5: 7-11Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). After loading the extract, the column was washed with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 5 mmEGTA, 10 mm mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and the proteins were eluted with a linear salt gradient of 0–0.4m KCl in 300 ml of equilibration buffer at a flow rate of 30 ml/h, and 8-ml fractions were collected. The peak fractions showing kinase activity were pooled and reverse-dialysed to 10–15 ml with PEG 20,000 at 4 °C. The concentrated DEAE-Sephacel-pooled fractions were dialysed against equilibration buffer (without EGTA and EDTA) for 2 h at 4 °C, and leupeptin (100 μm) was added before loading onto the PS affinity column, which was prepared according to the procedure of Uchida and Filburn (46Uchida T. Filburn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12311-12314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein was eluted first with 15 ml of column buffer containing 14 mmCaCl2 followed by 45 ml of 1 mmCaCl2, followed by CaCl2, and the final elution was done with 2 mm EGTA and additional 3-ml fractions were collected. All fractions were collected in plastic tubes and immediately assayed for kinase activity and protein estimations. Purified protein was passed through gel filtration in a Sephacryl 300 (90 × 2 cm) column equilibrated with equilibration buffer, and the elution was carried out at a flow rate of 20 ml/h using the same buffer. Fractions containing kinase activity were pooled, reverse-dialysed, and stored at −20 °C. SDS-PAGE was done according to Laemmli (47Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). A 10% gel was used, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver staining (48Merril C.R Goldman D. VanKeuren M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The protein was eluted from gel slices using a modified method of Satiel et al.(49Satiel A.R. Fox J.A. Sherline P. Sahyoun N. Cuatrecasas P. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 759-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, after SDS-PAGE, one lane was stained, destained, and aligned with the rest of the gel. The protein band of interest was cut and minced in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The kinase C-type activity was assayed using histone H-1 (Type III) as a substrate. The reaction volume (100 μl) contained 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 40 μg of histone, 10 μg of PS, 100 μm CaCl2, 4 μg of OAG or 15 ng of PMA, and 50 μl of enzyme solution. The enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (200,000 cpm, specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol; obtained from BARC). The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 5 min and stopped by ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10%). Precipitates were collected on GF/C Whatman filter discs, washed 4–5 times with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and counted in a LKB scintillation counter. Enzyme assays were performed by using P81 paper (50Polya G.M. Chandra S. Condron R. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 545-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The specific activity is expressed as pmol of 32P incorporated min−1mg−1 protein. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Bradford (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. For identifying amino acids that are phosphorylated in histone, samples were digested in the presence of 5.7 n HCl at 110 °C for 2 h. The acid hydrolysate was lyophilized, resolubilized in water (100 μl), and applied on Whatman chromatography paper along with standards. Phosphoamino acids were separated by using a solvent consisting of propionic acid:1m NH4OH:isopropyl alcohol (45:17.5:17.5) as used by Neufeld et al. (52Neufeld E. Goren H.J. Boland D. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 1771: 138-143Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After the run, paper was dried and sprayed with ninhydrin to develop the spots. The paper was exposed to x-ray films. Binding studies with [3H]PMA were performed as described earlier (53Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3577-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The conditions used for binding were similar to those used for kinase assays. Binding reactions were carried out at 4 °C for 2 h followed either by PEG 8000 precipitation (54Sharkley N.A. Leach K.L. Blunberg P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) or collected on GF/C (46Uchida T. Filburn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12311-12314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or GF/F filters as described (53Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3577-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To analyze PMA binding on gel the precipitates were collected, washed with buffer (30 mmHEPES, 5 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 100 μm leupeptin), dissolved in native gel buffer, and analyzed by electrophoresis. The gel was cut into different segments and counted in a scintillation counter. New Zealand White rabbit was used for raising antibodies. A homogenous preparation of the enzyme eluted from the gel after SDS-PAGE was used for immunization (55Harlow E.D. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 53-135Google Scholar). Four intradermal injections (0.5 ml) were given to the rabbits at a gap of 1 month at multiple sites. The test bleeding was done from the ear vein, and the debris was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. For ELISA, wells of the microtiter plate were coated with purified kinase of different dilutions (1:500, 1:1000, 1:2000). The enzyme was immunoprecipitated by adding different amounts of antiserum to a fixed concentration (1 μg) of purified kinase. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 7–8 h, centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, and the enzyme activity was checked in the supernatant. 1:4000 and 1:5000 dilutions of the antisera were used. To detect the antibodies, HRP conjugate was used with o-phenylenediamine as the substrate, and absorbance at 492 nm was read on an ELISA reader (Labsystems Multiscan Biochromatic by Biological Diagnostic Supplies Ltd., Aryashire, UK). Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose paper according to the procedure of Towbin et al. (56Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordont J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). For developing immunoblots, the antibodies raised for Z. mays kinase were used as primary antibodies at 1:200 dilution. Blocking was done with bovine serum albumin (3% w/v in phosphate-buffered saline) for 2 h at 37 °C with constant shaking. The blots were incubated in the primary antibodies for 2–3 h and then for 30 min with the secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies (HRP) or alkaline phosphatase-linked antibodies (1:30,000). Three washes of 5 min each were given with PBST (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.3), Tween 20 (0.1%)) after each incubation. The protein-antibody complex was detected by using 4-chloronaphthol as a substrate for the HRP-linked assay and with BCIP and NBT for the alkaline phosphatase-linked assay. RNA was isolated according to the methods of Logemann et al. (57Logemann J. Schell J. Willmitzer L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar) and as described earlier (44Raghuram N. Sopory S.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thirty μg of RNA samples were denatured in the presence of 6% formaldehyde and 50% formamide at 50 °C for 1 h and blotted on a GeneScreen Plus membrane. The RNAs were cross-linked to the membrane utilizing the stratalinker (Stratagene). The filters were baked at 80 °C. A32P-labeled probe was generated by the random primer extension method using a NR cDNA of maize (58Gowri G. Campbell W.H. Plant Physiol. 1989; 90: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or a chicken actin cDNA. The labeling was performed by a commercial labeling kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific activity of the probe was 9 × 108 dpm/μg. Pre-hybridization was performed for 15–30 min at 65 °C in 0.5m NaCl, 0.1 m NaH2PO4, 0.1m Tris base, 2 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Denatured probe (l × 106 dpm/ml) was added, and the hybridization was continued for 24 h at 65 °C. Washings were done using 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS, initially at room temperature and then at hybridization temperature. For chicken actin probe the specific activity obtained was 5 × 106 dpm/μg. The hybridization was carried out at 55 °C in 6 × SSC, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Washings were done in 2 × SSC, 1% SDS at hybridization temperature followed by 0.5 × SSC at room temperature. The washed filters were exposed for autoradiography. Each experiment was repeated at least three times and in addition the kinase assays were done in triplicate. For Northern blot, data from a representative experiment are given. Seven-day-old etiolated seedlings of Z. mays (var. Ganga-5) were used for the extraction of the enzyme as given under “Experimental Procedures.” The supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 100,000 ×g was loaded onto a DEAE-Sephacel column. The protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient (0–0.4 m), and the fractions were assayed for kinase activity in the presence of PS, PMA, Ca2+ using histone H1 as a substrate. Fig. 1 A shows the protein elution and kinase activity profiles of DEAE-Sephacel fractions. The fractions showing maximum kinase activities were pooled, leupeptin was added to avoid proteolytic degradation of PKC, and the fractions were loaded onto a PS affinity column. The elution was done first with 1 mm Ca2+ followed by a buffer containing 0.1 mm Ca2+ and finally by EGTA (2 mm). All fractions were assayed for kinase activity. Fig. 1 Bshows the protein and kinase activity profiles of the fractions obtained after PS affinity column chromatography. Most of the protein was eluted with 1 mm Ca2+. An analysis of the protein composition of fraction 18 on SDS-PAGE, which showed the maximum enzyme activity and eluted with 0.1 mmCa2+, showed two polypeptides of 70 and 55 kDa. Both polypeptides could also be detected on native gels. To separate these two proteins, the peak kinase activity fractions were pooled, reverse-dialysed, and loaded onto a gel filtration column. Fig. 2 A shows the protein profile and kinase activity profile. The analysis of the protein composition from three different fractions showed that the PS, PMA, and Ca2+ kinase activity was associated with a 70-kDa protein (Fig. 2 A, inset). To further purify the protein and to improve its recovery, the side fractions, which also contained the 55-kDa polypeptide, were combined and loaded onto a preparative SDS-PAGE, and the 70-kDa protein was gel-eluted and again loaded on to a SDS gel. The eluted protein was finally loaded onto a gel filtration column. Fig. 2 B shows the elution profile of the kinase activity, and the inset(SDS-PAGE) shows the homogeneity of the protein. The kinase was enriched 329-fold with a yield of approximately 0.07% (TableI). The molecular mass of the gel-purified protein (70 kDa) corresponds to that found in gel filtration assays (69.8 kDa). This suggests that the protein functions as a monomer. It was named Z. mays conventional protein kinase C (ZmcPKC).Table ISummary of purification of protein kinase C homolog (ZmcPKC70) from etiolated Z. maysFractionTotal proteinSpecific activity-Fold purificationYieldmgnmol/min/mgCrude850021100DEAE-Sephacel16008419PS affinity282991490.35Gel filtration165282640.18First PAGE106123060.12Gel filtration5.56783290.07 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 shows that the optimum pH for the purified kinase activity was 7.5. Fig. 4shows that the optimal Mg2+ concentration was 5 mm in the presence of optimal PS and OAG at optimum free Ca2+ concentrations. The effects of varying concentrations of different lipids (PS, OAG, and PMA) were checked in the presence of optimum Ca2+ concentration (100 μm). The free Ca2+ was estimated to be 1.48 × 10−8m as calculated by Sillen and Martell (59Sillen L.G. Martell A.E. Stability Constants of Metal Ions Complexes. The Chemical Society, Burlington House, London1971Google Scholar). Fig. 4 also shows that the PS optimum for kinase activity was 10 μm,that of OAG was 4 μm, and that of PMA was 15 nm in the presence of optimal PS and Ca2+concentrations. Fig. 5 shows that the kinase activity in the presence of PS and PMA is dependent on Ca2+. In the absence of lipids, Ca2+ alone stimulated the kinase activity 20–30% and even with increasing concentrations of Ca2+ the activity of the kinase was not further stimulated. However, to activate the kinase maximally by lipids, Ca2+ was essential. At 100 μmCa2+, a 12-fold stimulation in the activity was achieved by the addition of PS and PMA. When calmodulin was added in place of lipids, the kinase activity was not stimulated more than 35% (data not given). These results indicated that the enzyme is a lipid-stimulated and Ca2+-requiring kinase.Figure 4Effect of various effectors on ZmcPKC70 activity.

Effect of Ca2+ on histone phosphorylation was monitored in the presence (PS and PMA) (•——•) and in absence of lipids (∣——∣).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm the nature of the kinase each component was tested at its optimal level either individually or together. Fig. 6 A shows that the PKC equivalent was maximally stimulated in the presence of PS, PMA, and Ca2+. The extent of stimulation in the presence of either PMA or OAG were comparable. To check this further, the substrate histone, H1, was separated, loaded onto a SDS-PAGE following phosphorylation by ZmcPKC70, and autoradiographed. Fig. 6 Bshows that PMA or OAG along with Ca2+ and PS maximally stimulated the phosphorylation of histone H1. To determine the amino acid residue at which histone H1 is phosphorylated, the phosphorylated histone band from SDS-PAGE was cut and digested with acid. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on paper chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As is seen in Fig. 6 C the histone was phosphorylated at serine residues. Using histone H1 as a substrate the kinetic behavior of ZmcPKC in the presence and absence of lipids was studied. Fig. 7 shows that theK m was high (9.7 μm) in the absence of PS, PMA, and Ca2+. The K m value was lowered to 7.8 μm on the addition of PS and PMA and was further lowered to 3.12 μm by the addition of Ca2+ suggesting that the enzyme activity is dependent on lipid and Ca2+. Decrease in V max in the presence of PS, PMA, and Ca2+ suggest the noncompetitive inhibition (Table II). In addition the Ca2+- and lipid-dependent kinase activity of ZmcPKC was inhibited in the presence of the kinase inhib"
https://openalex.org/W2043491104,"Pax-3, a transcription factor that is required for development of the embryonic neural tube, neural crest, and somitic derivatives, contains two DNA-binding domains, a paired domain, and a paired-type homeodomain. Although Pax-3 binds to sequences related to the e5 element of the Drosophila even-skipped gene, the sequence requirements of an optimal Pax-3 response element have not been well characterized. Using both DNA-binding domains and a pool of random oligonucleotides, we identified a new paired box consensus motif, “GTTAT,” which was located 1, 4, 5, 8, or 13 base pairs downstream of the homeobox binding motif, “ATTA.” Binding analysis of these sequences demonstrated that the distance between recognition elements for the homeodomain and the paired domain affects affinity. Specifically, spacing elements 1 or 13 base pairs apart from each other conferred low affinity Pax-3 binding, whereas intermediate spacing (5 or 8 base pairs) conferred high affinity binding. Contrary to previous reports, oligonucleotides deleted for either the ATTA or the GTTAT could also be bound by Pax-3, although both sites were necessary for maximal affinity. Finally, transient transfections demonstrated that Pax-3 trans-activation correlated with binding affinity. Because the Pax-3-responsive genes identified to date contain almost exclusively low affinity binding sequences, our analysis indicates that they may be responsive to Pax-3 only when cellular levels are high.

Because the Pax-3-responsive genes identified to date contain almost exclusively low affinity binding sequences, our analysis indicates that they may be responsive to Pax-3 only when cellular levels are high. Pax-3 encodes a bipartite DNA-binding transcription factor that is essential for vertebrate embryogenesis. The two DNA-binding domains consist of a 128-amino acid paired domain, which itself is comprised of two helix-turn-helix subdomains that bind to distinct DNA recognition sequences (1Czerny T. Schaffner G. Busslinger M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2048-2061Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar, 2Jun S. Desplan C. Development ( Camb. ). 1996; 122: 2639-2650PubMed Google Scholar), and a 61-amino acid paired-type homeodomain. In the mouse embryo, expression ofPax-3 begins on day 8.5 in the dorsal neuroepithelium along the anterior-posterior axis (3Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). By day 9.5, Pax-3expression extends into the lateral dermomyotome, somitic mesoderm, and neural crest (3Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). The Pax-3 gene is essential for differentiation of the neural tube and otherPax-3-expressing tissues, as mutation or deletion of the gene is responsible for the Splotch phenotype in mice (4Goulding M.D. Lumsden A.

Zool. 1954; 127: 305-329Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Similarly, reduced expression of Pax-3 in embryos of diabetic mice causes exencephaly (8Phelan S.A. Ito M. Loeken M.R. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that a threshold level of functional protein is critical for proper neural tube development. The amino acid sequence of the murine Pax-3 paired domain is 100% identical to the human PAX-3 paired domain, suggesting that it performs similar regulatory functions during embryogenesis of mice and humans (9Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Newton V.E. Patton M. Gruss P. Harris R. Strachan T. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Indeed, mutations in the human PAX-3 gene have been found in patients with Waardenburg Syndrome (9Tassabehji M. Read A.P. Newton V.E. Patton M. Gruss P. Harris R. Strachan T. Nat.

Additional evidence of Pax-3's role in regulatory processes is that in humans, the pediatric solid tumor, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, appears to result from a genetic translocation which causes production of a fusion protein comprised of the DNA-binding domains of PAX-3 and the trans-activation domain of the FKHR protein (12Shapiro D.N.

The prototypical paired domain was first identified in the protein products of several Drosophila segmentation genes, includingpaired (prd) and gooseberry(gsb) (15Baumgartner S. Bopp D. Burri M.

The Drosophila Prd protein binds specifically to the e5 sequence found in the promoter of theDrosophila even-skipped gene (18Treisman J. Gonczy P. Vashishtha M. Harris E. Desplan C.

Like theDrosophila Prd protein, murine Pax-3 can bind specifically to the e5 sequence (3Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Nuclease protection analysis has suggested that the Pax-3 homeodomain binds to an ATTA motif within the e5 sequence, and the paired domain binds to a GTTCC core motif (20Chalepakis G. Goulding M. Read A. Strachan T. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3685-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which is 5 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; hGH, human growth hormone; nt, nucleotide(s); CMV, cytomegalovirus. downstream of the ATTA. Study of the effects of base substitution within the paired domain binding element of e5 have indicated that Pax-3 binding can tolerate some sequence variation at the last three positions within the 5-bp core paired recognition element (9Tassabehji M.

Cell. 1986; 47: 735-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Although each of the DNA-binding domains of Drosophila Prd can bind to e5 recognition elements independent of the other (18Treisman J. Gonczy P. Vashishtha M. Harris E. Desplan C. Cell. 1989; 59: 594-604Google Scholar, 21Treisman J. Harris E. Desplan D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), albeit with lower affinity than binding by both domains together (2Jun S. Desplan C. Development ( Camb. ). 1996; 122: 2639-2650PubMed Google Scholar), previous studies have demonstrated that Pax-3 binding to e5 oligonucleotides requires both the homeodomain binding sequence and the paired domain binding sequence (20Chalepakis G. Goulding M. Read A. Strachan T. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3685-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Furthermore, localization of the paired domain and homeodomain recognition elements within 2–10 bp of each other has been found to be essential for Pax-3 binding (22Chalepakis G. Wijnholds J. Gruss P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3131-3137Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results would indicate that a sequence, ATTA-N2–10-GTT/CAT/C is important for Pax-3 binding and transcription regulation. However, among the few genes that are positively or negatively regulated by Pax-3 in vertebrate embryos, including myelin basic protein, N-CAM, c-Met, and myoD(23Epstein J.A. Shapiro D.N. Chang J.

In the case of the N-CAM promoter, a Pax-3 variant containing just the paired domain is able to bind to a Pax-3-responsive region, but the intact protein is not (24Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Edelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12745-12749Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This suggests that additional analysis of the sequence determinants for Pax-3 binding must be performed to identify putative Pax-3 response elements in its downstream regulated genes. We report here the identification of a new consensus sequence for Pax-3 binding from a pool of random oligonucleotides using both the DNA-binding domains of Pax-3. Oligonucleotides containing variations of the consensus sequence were evaluated for Pax-3 binding affinity and for trans-activation by Pax-3. From these results, a model in which the magnitude of transcriptional responsiveness of target genes depends on binding affinity is presented. The RF1-Pax-3 expression plasmid (28Maulbecker C.C. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), kindly provided by George Chalepakis (Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Germany), was used as a template for PCR amplification of a 775-bp region surrounding the complete paired box and paired-type homeobox of the Pax-3 cDNA using the forward and reverse primers, ACTGCGAATTCGCTGGAAGTG and TGACGGAATTCATCAGTTGATTGGC, respectively. Each primer was designed to contain an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′ terminus of the PCR product. PCR reactions contained 0.2 μm each of the above Pax-3 primers, 180 ng RF1/Pax-3 DNA, 0.5 mm dNTP, 1 × PCR buffer, and 1 unit of AmpliTaq (Perkin-Elmer). 30 cycles were performed using the following conditions: 95 °C for 2 min, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a 5 min extension at 72 °C. The entire PCR reaction was digested with EcoRI and electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, from which the 795-bp fragment was isolated using the Geneclean kit (Bio-101, Inc.) using the manufacturer's suggestions. This fragment was ligated into EcoRI-digested, dephosphorylated pGEX-3X plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to transform DH5α strain of Escherichia coli cells that had been made competent as described (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1–2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). The sequence of the resulting GST/Pax-3 fusion cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar) using a Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The GST/Pax-3 fusion protein was prepared using the GST gene fusion system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fusion protein production was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 2 h, and protein was isolated and purified according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Samples from the initial bacterial cell lysate and the final bead eluates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) using a 10% polyacrylamide gel. High molecular weight prestained protein standards (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used to the estimate the sizes of the protein products. Following electrophoresis, protein gels were either fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize protein components (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1–2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar) or used for Western blotting as follows. Protein gels were electroblotted with a Semi-Phor TE70 semi-dry blotter (Hoefer Scientific) onto Duralon UV nylon membranes (Stratagene). Membranes and filter paper were presoaked in transfer buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.01% SDS, then electroblotted for 1 h at 200 mA. Membranes were rinsed in TBS (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl), then blocked for 1 h at room temp with rocking, in 1% dry milk in TBS. Membranes were incubated with 10 ml of a 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-GST antibody, kindly provided by Dr. Bill Kaelin (Dana Farber Cancer Institute), diluted in 1% dry milk/TBS solution, and rocked overnight at 4 °C. Following three subsequent 10 min washes with TBS, membranes were incubated with 20 ml of a 1:5000 dilution (100 milliunits) of goat anti-mouse IgG antibody solution (Oncogene Science) and rocked for 1 h at room temperature. Three additional 10-min washes with TBS were followed by a 1-min rinse with 1 × AP buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). 30 ml of AP buffer were mixed with 49.5 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, then 99 μl of 4-nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (both from Boehringer Mannheim), after which the solution was immediately added to the blot and rocked at room temp until color reaction appeared (approximately 2–3 min). Reactions were stopped by rinsing the blot with distilled H2O, and blots were subsequently stored in aluminum foil to preserve color. Ten nmol of double-stranded e5 oligonucleotide were prepared by annealing equal molar amounts of complementary oligonucleotides (GATCCTCGACTCTCAGCACCGCACGATTAGCACCGTTCCGCTCCCTGCA and GGGAGCGGAACGGTGCTAATCGTGCGGTGCTGAGAGTCGAG) (3Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) in 100 μl containing 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaPO4. Reactions were heated to 85 °C for 3 min, then the solution was allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. Approximately 50 pmol were used for 3′ end labeling reactions (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 1–2. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar) with 5 units of Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, using 2 μl of [32P]dGTP (3000 Ci/mmol). DNA was phenol-chloroform- and chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 10 μl of H2O. Approximately 20 fmol of probe were incubated with 1 μl of eluted GST or GST/Pax-3 protein and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim), in 90 mm KCl, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 6.5% glycerol (32Chalepakis G. Gruss P. Gene ( Amst. ). 1995; 162: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed in the presence of unlabeled competitor DNA (e5, or E2, described below) at a 0-, 50-, 100-, or 200-fold molar excess and were carried out for 20 min at 30 °C and were electrophoresed for 2 h at 150 volts on a 0.75-mm 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE. Gels were dried onto 3MM filter paper (Whatman) and exposed to film at −80 °C for 16–72 h. The sequence of the random oligonucleotide was designed according to previously described flanking anchor sequences (33Norby P.L. Pallisgaard N. Pedersen F.S. Jorgensen P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6317-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), for cloning. This sequence, CGGGCTGAGATCAGTCTAGA TCT(N)35GGATCCGAGACTGAGCGTCGTC, where the XbaI and BamHI restriction sites are underlined, and the internal BglII restriction site is indicated in italics. An oligonucleotide containing the e5 sequence, and the flanking anchor sequences in the random oligonucleotide, was designed to be used as a control. The sequence of this oligonucleotide was: CGGGCTGAGATCAGTCTAGA TCTGATCCTCGACTCTCAGCACCGCACGATTAGCACCGTTCCGCTCCCTGCAGGATCCGAGACTGAGCGTCGTC, with internally designed restriction endonuclease digestion sites indicated as above. Double-stranded radiolabeled probes were synthesized by annealing each oligonucleotide with the following 3′ anchor primer: GACGACGCTCAGTCTCGGATCC, followed by extension with Klenow, as described above, in the presence of 1 μl of [32P]dCTP in place of unlabeled dCTP. Probes were electrophoresed on an 8% nondenaturing acrylamide gel, and bands were excised and eluted overnight at 37 °C in 400 μl of acrylamide extraction buffer (0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% SDS, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) (34Perkins A.S. Fishel R. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2665-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). DNA was phenol-chloroform- and chloroform extracted and precipitated with 0.25m NaCl, 10 μg glycogen, and 3 × volume of 100% ethanol for 1 h at −80 °C. DNA was resuspended in 100 μl of TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA), and incorporated radioactivity was measured in counts/min (cpm) in a scintillation counter. Binding site selection procedure was performed as described previously (35Blackwell T.K. Kertzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. Between 12,000 and 15,000 cpm of probe were incubated with 1 μl of eluted GST/Pax-3 protein in a 20 μl of binding reaction containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 10 μl of GST fusion protein binding buffer (36Fainsod A. Margalit Y. Haffner R. Gruenbaum Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ZnSO4, mm dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol), for 30 min, at 30 °C. Reactions were electrophoresed as described above. The initial binding reaction was electrophoresed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel alongside a complex of GST/Pax-3 and radiolabeled e5 probe that was used as a migration control. The lane containing random oligonucleotide was excised from the gel at the same position as a GST/Pax-3·e5 complex, and bound DNA at that position was eluted from the gel, phenol-extracted, and precipitated as described above. Half of the eluted oligonucleotides were PCR-amplified in 50 μl of PCR reactions containing 0.2 μm each of a 5′ anchor primer, CGGGCTGAGATCAGTCTAGATCT, and the 3′ anchor primer used for second strand synthesis, 200 μm of each dATP, dTTP, and dGTP, 2 μm dCTP, 1 μl of [32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 2.5 mmMgCl2, 1 × AmpliTaq buffer (Perkin-Elmer), and 5 units of AmpliTaq polymerase. 30 cycles of PCR were performed using the following cycling conditions: 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 2 min; 72 °C, 30 s; followed by a 5-min extension at 72 °C. PCR reactions were electrophoresed on 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and exposed to x-ray film for 1–3 min. Probes were excised, eluted, precipitated, and counted, as described above. Approximately 12,000–15,000 cpm were used for a subsequent round of binding and amplification. This selection procedure was repeated for a total of four complete rounds of enrichment, and following the fourth round of selection, the final PCR products were digested with XbaI and BamHI, purified on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, and cloned into the XbaI-BamHI sites of the pBluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene). The selected oligonucleotides are referred to as SAAB (selected and amplifiedbinding sites) (35Blackwell T.K. Kertzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) sequences. Individual clones were selected and digested with BglII to verify the presence of insert. Sequencing of selected clones was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (30Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52669) Google Scholar) with the Sequenase version 2.0 kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), using the supplied M13 −40 reverse primer. Individual probes for gel shift assays were radiolabeled by PCR amplification using [32P]dCTP, as described above for random oligonucleotide selection. DNA templates for PCR included approximately 10–100 pmol of double-stranded oligonucleotide (for the GST/Pax-3-selected random oligonucleotide pool, e5, e5seq, and e5spac) or 100 ng plasmid DNA from cloned saab oligonucleotides (for saab-1, saab-8, and saab-13). Probes were gel purified, as described above, and resuspended in 100 μl of TE. Specific activity was determined by counting 1 μl of resuspended probe in a scintillation counter and calculating molar amount of probe from percent incorporation of labeled dCTP. Five to ten fmol of32P-labeled probe were incubated with GST/Pax-3 protein as described above, in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide, as indicated in figure legends. Sequences for oligonucleotides used for probes in competition assays included e5, CGGGCTGAGATCAGTCTAGATCTATTAGCACCGTTCCGGATCCGAGACTGAGCGTCGTC; e5seq, CGGGCTGAGATCAGTCTAGATCTATTAGCACCGTTATGGATCCGAGACTGAGCGTCGTC; and e5 spac, CGGGCTGAGATCAGTCTAGATCTATTAAGTTCCGGATCCGAGACTGAGCGTCGTC. In addition, oligonucleotides were designed to the saab-8 sequence, base-substituted for either the ATTA or GTTAT motif. These two single site oligonucleotides were designated PDbs (containing the putative paired domain binding site): GACGACGCTCAGTCTCGGATCCTAATAATGAACATGTATGCCGTATATTTAGTTATTAGATCTAGACTGATCTCAGCCCG and HDbs (containing the putative homeodomain binding site): CGGGCTGAGATCAGTCTAGATCTACGCCGTAAATATATAATATACATGTTCATTATTAGGATCCGAGACTGAGCGTCGTC. Retained putative binding sites are shown in boldface, and mutated bases are underlined. Sequences of the homologous competitors for each selected oligonucleotide were AGCTTTAGTGAATTATGTTATTAAAATGGTCTAGAC (for saab-1), AGCTTTGTATATTATATATTTAGTTATGGTCTAGAC (for saab-8), and AGCTTATTATGTTTTACTAGATGTTATGGTCTAGAC (for saab-13). Reactions were analyzed on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was subsequently dried onto Whatman 3MM paper, and exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C, overnight. Dried gels from gel mobility shift assays were exposed on a phosphor screen for 16–72 h, and images were scanned on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Bands were analyzed and quantitated with ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The Rf1-Pax-3 expression plasmid (28Maulbecker C.C. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2361-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), obtained from George Chalepakis (here referred to as pCMV/Pax-3), was used for co-transfection experiments. A negative control expression plasmid, referred to as pCMV, was derived from pCMV/Pax-3 by excision of the Pax-3 cDNA fragment with BamHI and XbaI. Blunt ends were formed using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, and linearized plasmid was excised from the gel and purified by Geneclean methods. The plasmid was circularized with T4 DNA Ligase. For construction of reporter plasmids, double-stranded saab-1, saab-8, and saab-13 oligonucleotides (described above), as well as a PRS-9 control (AGCTTGATTAGCACCGTTACGGTCTAGAGGTCTAGC) were kinased with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The pTKGH reporter plasmid (HGH-TGES 100T kit, Nichols Institute), which contains herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter sequences fused to the hGH (human growth hormone) gene, was digested withHindIII and dephosphorylated as described above. 50 ng of each double-stranded oligonucleotide was used in ligation reactions along with 100 ng of HindIII-digested dephosphorylated pTKGH. Individual clones were used in PCR reactions containing primers designed to the pTKGH plasmid, flanking the site of insertion, to verify the presence of insert. These forward and reverse primers were GTAAAACGACGGCCAGTG and TGAAGCAGGACCTGCAGC, respectively. The sequences of inserts were verified by sequencing with an upstream primer designed to the pTKGH vector, GCAAGGCGATTAAGTTGG. Recombinant reporter plasmids contained PRS-9, saab-1, and saab-13 inserts with the ATTA 5′ to the GTTAT element, and the saab-8 insert was found in the opposite orientation. NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 μg/ml Streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and were grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 35-mm tissue culture plates and transiently transfected when they were 60–70% confluent with a total of 30 μg of DNA by CaPO4-mediated transfection, using the CellPhect transfection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 10 μg of reporter plasmid, 10 μg of pCMV/Pax-3 or pCMV, and 10 μg of calf thymus DNA (Sigma) were used to transfect duplicate cultures, in three separate experiments. DNA precipitates were incubated with cells for 16 h, followed by removal of the precipitate and incubation for 1 h with fresh medium. This medium was again replaced, and cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. At the end of the culture period, media were collected for secreted growth hormone assays, using the HGH-TGES 100T radioimmunoassay kit (Nichols Institute), according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. hGH standards, provided with the kit, were diluted with medium to determine a standard curve for each individual assay, to estimate actual amounts of hGH expression. Results of four repeated transfection experiments performed on successive days, each of which was performed in duplicate plates for each combination of transfected DNA, was analyzed statistically by analysis of variance, followed by post hoc Duncan's multiple range test, using a Statistica software application for the Macintosh. To express both of the Pax-3 DNA-binding domains for selection of novel binding sequences, a GST/Pax-3 fusion vector was constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This GST/Pax-3 fusion protein was able to bind to an oligonucleotide containing the Drosophila e5 sequence, a cognate Pax-3 binding element, as shown by gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 1). A single shifted complex was formed in the presence of the GST/Pax-3 fusion protein (Fig. 1, lane 1), and this complex was competed by 50–200-fold molar excess of unlabeled e5 oligonucleotide (Fig. 1,lanes 2–4). In contrast, a nonspecific oligonucleotide, derived from nt −30 to +40 of the adenovirus E2A promoter (E2), did not compete for binding (Fig. 1, lanes 5–7), demonstrating that the interaction between GST/Pax-3 and e5 was specific. The GST protein alone failed to form a complex with the e5 probe (Fig. 1,lane 8), demonstrating that the DNA-binding domains of Pax-3 were required for this interaction. This GST/Pax-3 fusion protein was used in the selection of Pax-3 binding sites from a pool of random oligonucleotides using a modification of the “saab” (selected andamplified binding sites) procedure (35Blackwell T.K. Kertzner L. Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1149-1151Cr"

Mammalian TPP II removes N-terminal tripeptides, has wide distribution, and has been identified as the cholecystokinin-degrading peptidase in rat brain. Size exclusion and ion exchange chromatography produced a 70-fold purification of dTPP II activity from Drosophila tissue extracts. The substrate specificity and the inhibitor sensitivity of dTPP II is comparable to that of the human enzyme. In particular, dTPP II is sensitive to butabindide, a specific inhibitor of the rat cholecystokinin-inactivating activity. We isolated a 4309-base pairdTPP II cDNA which predicts a 1354-amino acid protein. The deduced human and Drosophila TPP II proteins display 38% overall identity. The catalytic triad, its spacing, and the sequences that surround it are highly conserved; the C-terminal end of dTPP II contains a 100-amino acid insert not found in the mammalian proteins. Recombinant dTPP II displays the predicted activity following expression in HEK cells. TPP II maps to cytological position 49F4-7; animals deficient for this interval show reduced TPP II activity.

Intercellular communication depends critically on both the generation and termination of biological signals. In the case of neuropeptides and neurohormones, the signaling molecules may be cleaved by extracellular enzymes to produce new active peptides (e.g. by angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE 1The abbreviations used are: ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; aa, amino acid(s); bp, base pairs; CCK, cholecystokinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; EST, expressed sequence tag; HEK, human embryonic kidney cells; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; kb, kilobase pairs; pNA, para-nitroanilide; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; suc, succinyl; TPP II, tripeptidyl peptidase II.

Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar)). These peptidases are found in the extracellular space or on the cell surface and typically have low specificity (for example substance P, neurokinins, neurotensin, and the endothelins can all be cleaved by enkephalinase, reviewed in Refs. 4Turner A.J.

Res. 1995; 104: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although a large number of peptidases have been identified in various tissues, only a handful have been shown definitively to be ectoenzymes with neuropeptide-degrading capability (reviewed in Refs. 4Turner A.J. Matsas R. Kenny A.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 1347-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholarand 5Csuhai E. Little S.S. Hersh L.B. Prog. Brain. Res. 1995; 104: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the current hypothesis that diverse neuropeptides are inactivated by a relatively small number of enzymes. Recently Rose et al. (6Rose C. Vargas F. Facchinetti P. Bourgeat P. Bambal R.B. Bishop P.B. Chan S.M.T. Moore A.N.J. Ganellin C.R. Schwartz J.-C. Nature. 1996; 380: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) identified a membrane-associated variant of the enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP II) as the peptidase responsible for cleavage and inactivation of the mammalian neuropeptide CCK-8. Intravenous injection of the potent TPP II inhibitor, butabindide, has pro-satiety effects on both behavior and gastric emptying (6Rose C. Vargas F. Facchinetti P. Bourgeat P. Bambal R.B. Bishop P.B. Chan S.M.T. Moore A.N.J. Ganellin C.R. Schwartz J.-C. Nature. 1996; 380: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Based on this pharmacology, as well as its substrate specificity, and its correlated expression in CCK-responsive tissues, Rose et al. (6Rose C. Vargas F. Facchinetti P. Bourgeat P. Bambal R.B. Bishop P.B. Chan S.M.T. Moore A.N.J. Ganellin C.R. Schwartz J.-C. Nature. 1996; 380: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) propose that the neuropeptidase activity of TPP II is intimately associated with CCK signaling and not broadly active on diverse neuropeptides. TPP II was previously isolated and characterized as an extra-lysosomal peptidase that could release N-terminal tripeptides from a wide range of larger substrates (7Bålöw R.-M. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11622-11628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bålöw R.-M. Tomkinson B. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2409-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TPP II is a serine protease with a subtilisin-like catalytic domain, but compared with other subtilases, it contains an extended C-terminal region (9Tomkinson B. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Zetterqvist Ö. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7508-7512Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The native form of the enzyme has a remarkably high molecular mass (>1000 kDa) that suggests an oligomeric association of the ∼138-kDa subunits (7Bålöw R.-M. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11622-11628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bålöw R.-M. Tomkinson B. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 380: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) enzymes have been cloned, and the genomic region encoding a putative homologue in Caenorhabditis elegans has been sequenced (GenBankTM accession number U23176). In both human and mouse cDNAs (12Tomkinson B. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), an alternatively spliced exon encoding an additional 13 amino acids has been identified, which is involved in complex formation (13Tomkinson B. Hansen M. Cheung W.-F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Rose et al. (6Rose C. Vargas F. Facchinetti P. Bourgeat P. Bambal R.B. Bishop P.B. Chan S.M.T. Moore A.N.J. Ganellin C.R. Schwartz J.-C. Nature. 1996; 380: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) identified both cytoplasmic and membrane-associated forms of rat TPP II and suggested that an alternatively spliced TPP II mRNA was involved in the membrane association through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor. Neuropeptides are important signaling molecules in insects (for review see Refs. 14O'Brien M.A. Taghert P.H. Zool. Sci. 1994; 11: 633-645PubMed Google Scholar and 15Nassel D.R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 842-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and the enzymes involved in neuropeptide regulation appear to be highly conserved (16Kolhekar A.S. Roberts M.S. Jiang N.

Previous studies of neuropeptidases in Drosophila have defined enzyme activities resembling enkephalinase (17Isaac R.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 18Lamango N.S. Isaac R.E. Insect Biochem. Mol.

J. 1987; 245: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In each case, theDrosophila activities displayed similar substrate specificities and inhibitor sensitivities to known mammalian enzymes. Furthermore, the gene encoding the Drosophila ACE,AnCE, demonstrates a high degree of sequence similarity to one form of mammalian ACE (20Cornell M.J. Williams T.C. Lamango N.S. Coates D. Corcol P.

We propose to use Drosophilagenetics to investigate the extent to which TPP II enzyme function has been conserved. In the current study, we show that a TPP II-like activity is present in Drosophila extracts. Furthermore, we partially purify this enzyme activity and characterize it in comparison to the mammalian enzyme. We have cloned and expressed a dTPP II cDNA. Finally, we use genetics to demonstrate that this cloned gene is largely responsible for the observed TPP II activity in tissue extracts. Chromogenic substrates were obtained from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland) and Sigma. N-Ethylmaleimide, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin, andp-chloromercuribenzoate were purchased from Sigma; iodoacetamide was obtained from BDH, and bestatin was from Boehringer Mannheim (Bromma, Sweden). Sepharose CL-4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden), and DEAE-cellulose (DE52) was from Whatman. A Nucleosil C18 column (10 μm; 4 × 250 mm) for HPLC was packed by Skandinaviska GeneTec AB (Kungsbacka, Sweden). Human TPP II was purified from red blood cells as described previously (8Bålöw R.-M. Tomkinson B. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2409-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications subsequently reported (9Tomkinson B. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Zetterqvist Ö. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7508-7512Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 22Tomkinson B. Zetterqvist Ö. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The inhibitor butabindide was a generous gift from Drs. Schwartz and Ganellin (6Rose C. Vargas F. Facchinetti P. Bourgeat P. Bambal R.B. Bishop P.B. Chan S.M.T. Moore A.N.J. Ganellin C.R. Schwartz J.-C. Nature. 1996; 380: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Standard culture methods were used to obtain large numbers of adult Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R strain) from which eggs were collected on agar-apple juice plates. Eggs were collected in 24-h intervals, washed in H2O, and stored at −70 °C until needed. Flies used for enzyme purification were 14–18 days old, quieted, and collected at 4 °C and frozen to −70 °C for storage. The deficiency lines Df(2R)vg 33 (49D;50A), Df(2R)vg 56 (49D;49F), Df(2R)vg B (49D3–4;50A1–2) andDf(2R)vg C (49B2–3;49E7-F1) were mapped according to complementation analysis inter seand with stocks bearing mutations (23Lasko P.F. Pardue M.L. Genetics. 1988; 120: 495-502PubMed Google Scholar, 24Morgan T.H. Bridges C.B. Schultz J. Carnegie Inst. Wash. Year Book. 1938; 37: 298-309Google Scholar). The following 12 ethyl methanesulfonate and one irradiated mutant stocks which potentially represent dTPP IIwere analyzed: vr3-2, vr4-57, vr5-5,vr5-48, vr6-6, vr6-R6 (gamma ray),vr 8-9, vr9-11, vr9,15-43, vr 9-23, vr11-14, vr13-24, andvr17-32. TPP II-like activity was measured in a 96-well plate by combining 100 μl of sample mixed with 50 μl of 0.8 mm Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA (AAF-pNA) and 50 μl of a 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, that contained 8 mm DTT. The plate was incubated at 37 °C and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was measured in a Multiscan PLUS reader (Labsystems). Tissue extract and cell lysate assays contained 100 μm bestatin to inhibit aminopeptidases. The enzyme preparations were diluted in a 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, that contained 30% glycerol and 1 mm DTT; this solution stabilizes the mammalian enzyme (7Bålöw R.-M. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11622-11628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We defined 1 unit to equal a change in absorbance of 0.001/min, which under these conditions corresponds to the hydrolysis of 0.04 nmol of the substrate, using the molar absorbance of 9.6 mm−1 cm−1 (25Peters K. Pauli D. Hache H. Boteva R.N. Genov N.C. Fittkau S. Curr. Microbiol. 1989; 18: 171-177Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). One unit defined as above corresponds to about 0.01 unit defined previously (11Tomkinson B. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 727-729PubMed Google Scholar) using the substrate Arg-Arg-Ala-[32P]Ser-Val-Ala, as determined by measuring of the same sample of purified human TPP II under the two assay conditions. Drosophila TPP II enzyme was partially purified from embryos and from adult flies in a two-step purification process. Tissues were homogenized at 1 g/4 ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, using a probe tip homogenizer (Ultra-turrax T25) with 2 pulses (10 s each) followed by sonication (MSE Soniprep 150) with 3 pulses (5 s each). Extract samples were prepared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min and filtration of the supernatant through glass wool. The filtered extract was loaded onto a Sepharose CL-4B column (Fig. 1 A). The active fractions were pooled and further purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography (Fig. 1 C). The column was eluted with a potassium gradient, and fractions were collected and analyzed by the standard assay. Active fractions were pooled for further characterization. The amount of protein in the samples was measured by the modified Bradford method (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217547) Google Scholar, 28Read S.M. Northcote D.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Samples were mixed with sample buffer to give final concentrations of 2.3% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C before loading onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel. The SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis were performed essentially as described previously (29Tomkinson B. Nyberg F. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using chicken anti-human TPP II antibody. Silver staining of the polyacrylamide gel was performed according to Morrisey (30Morrisey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2942) Google Scholar). Assays to determine substrate specificity were conducted according to the standard procedure, but various chromogenic substrates were substituted for the standard AAF-pNA, all at a concentration of 0.2 mm. During inhibitor sensitivity assays, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was substituted for DTT in the enzyme dilution buffer to stabilize the enzyme because the presence of 1 mm DTT would hamper the effect of the thiol-reactive compounds. The final concentration of DTT in the incubation was therefore about 50 μm. In control experiments greater than 95% of the activity was retained under these conditions. Inhibitor solutions were prepared according to manufacturers' protocols, and none of the solvents used had any effect on dTPP II activity at the concentrations used. The enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor for 30 min at 22 °C before addition of the substrate. For the determination of K m, 2–5 units of enzyme prepared from Drosophila according to Table I or purified recombinant dTPP II were incubated in triplicates with AAF-pNA at concentrations of 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.025 mm in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, that contained 15% glycerol and 2.5 mm DTT and 1% Me2SO. TheK m was calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plots to 157 and 138 μm using two different Drosophilaenzyme preparations and to 107 and 103 μm for two different preparations of recombinant dTPP II. For the determination ofK i for butabindide, the enzyme was incubated with AAF-pNA at concentrations of 0.5, 0.1, or 0.025 mm in the absence or presence of butabindide (0.025, 0.1, or 0.4 μm) at 37 °C and pH 7.5, as described above. TheK i was determined in two separate experiments to 0.12 and 0.15 μm using two differentDrosophila enzyme preparations and 0.11 and 0.14 μm for two different preparations of recombinant dTPP II.Table IPurification of dTPP II from Drosophila extractsPurification stepTotal volumeProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurification factorμg/μlunits/μl%units/μgExtract2.014.87.580.51100Sepharose CL-4B11.50.40.942.35714.6DEAE-cellulose9.60.0220.7735.04969The enzyme was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data represent one purification out of four performed. Open table in a new tab The enzyme was purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data represent one purification out of four performed. For analysis of cleavage products, 6 units of enzyme were incubated with the nonapeptide GVLRRASVA (10 nmoles) in 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, that contained 2 mm DTT and 3% glycerol, in a final volume of 100 μl at 37 °C. As a control the enzyme was incubated without the substrate. The reaction was interrupted by diluting the sample 10-fold with buffer A, and the sample was stored at −20 °C. An aliquot (200 μl) was loaded on a Nucleosil C18 column that was equilibrated with a mixture containing 90% (v/v) buffer A (60 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.8, 15 mm sodium pentane sulfonate, and 17.7 mm triethylamine) and 10% buffer B (18 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 2.8, 15 mmsodium pentane sulfonate, 17.7 mm triethylamine, and 35% (v/v) ethanol). As per Rosén et al. (31Rosén J. Tomkinson B. Pettersson G. Zetterqvist O. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3827-3834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), elution was performed at 1 ml/min, with a gradient of 10–90% buffer B. The gradient was started at 10 min and finished at 40 min, and the column was thereafter eluted with 90% buffer B for 20 min. A partial clone, PGA9, recovered from a 9- to 12-h embryonic cDNA library (K. Zinn, CalTech) showed high sequence homology to the 5′ end of the mammalian TPP II. 2R. Nusse and F. Van Leeuwen, personal communication. The missing 3′ portion of the dTPP II gene was cloned using two PCR steps. Nested, gene-specific oligonucleotides were made in the sense direction corresponding to positions +2171 (CCAAGCAATCCTGTCGT) and +2278 (TGCATTGCCAAGTACTG) of the PGA9 clone. In the first round of PCR, oligonucleotide +2171 and the lambda gt11 reverse vector oligonucleotide were used to amplify templates from 5 μl of an amplified stock of the Zinn library. Klentaque LA (Sigma) enzyme was added prior to a 5-min 95 °C phage-denaturing step followed by 30 cycles of 20-s 96 °C denaturing, 30-s 50 °C annealing, and 3-min 68 °C extension. 5% of the unpurified product of the first PCR reaction served as template for a second round of amplification with the nested gene-specific oligonucleotide +2278 and the lambda gt11 reverse vector oligonucleotide. The same cycling conditions, without the initial denaturing step, were used and produced a distinct band. This product was cloned into the T/A vector according to manufacturer's recommendations (Promega, Madison, WI) with the exception that the Klentaque LA enzyme was used. A full-length clone, LD18681, containing EST sequence number AA538993, was obtained from Genome Systems (St. Louis, MO). Genomic clones containingdTPPII sequences were isolated from a Charon 4A library using the PGA9 clone and standard techniques (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence was determined by automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems) using gene- and vector-specific oligonucleotides. Low stringency Southern blot analysis was performed using a 50% formamide hybridization solution at 37 °C. The filter was rinsed with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature. ThedTPP II cDNA clone LD18681 was amplified by PCR using the vector oligonucleotide T3 and a gene-specific oligonucleotide that included the stop codon and introduced a NotI restriction site for cloning into the expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Clones were recovered in both the forward and reverse orientation. The mouse TPP II gene was cloned into theEcoRI site of the same vector (13Tomkinson B. Hansen M. Cheung W.-F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The constructs were introduced into HEK cells in culture by lipid transfection (TransITTM) according to manufacturer's protocol (Mirus Corp., Madison, WI) and incubated 40–60 h. Cells were harvested, rinsed in PBS, lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 1% Triton X-100 (100 μl/106 cells), and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted 10-fold in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer that contained 30% glycerol and 1 mm DTT. TPP II activity was assayed according to standard procedure. For the preparation of stable transformants the constructs were introduced into HEK cells in culture by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and stable clones were selected after growing the cells in medium containing Geneticin, as described previously (13Tomkinson B. Hansen M. Cheung W.-F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Approximately 30 × 106 cells were harvested, lysed (10 μl lysis buffer/106 cells), centrifuged, and diluted as described above. The diluted supernatant (2.6 ml) was loaded onto a Sepharose column for chromatography and analysis as described in Fig. 1 A. Pooled fractions were loaded as a 10-ml sample onto a DEAE-cellulose column, and chromatography was performed as described in Fig. 1 C. The peak fractions were pooled and used for further characterization. Two independent strategies were used to identify the cytological location of the dTPP II gene.In situ hybridization of the genomic phage clones to polytene chromosomes of salivary glands of third instar larvae was carried out using a biotin-avidin detection system (ENZO Detek) and standard techniques (33Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 37-49Google Scholar). As the second strategy, we screened aDrosophila P1 library (34Smoller D.A. Petrov D. Hartl D.L. Chromosoma. 1991; 100: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Genome Systems) with a 1-kb 3′ fragment of the dTPP II cDNA. To investigate the endogenous TPP II-like activity in Drosophila extracts we used the substrate AAF-pNA (8Bålöw R.-M. Tomkinson B. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2409-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tomkinson B. Hansen M. Cheung W.-F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The activity was measured in the presence of the inhibitor bestatin in order to protect the substrate from sequential aminopeptidase degradation. We found approximately 0.5 units/μg protein in Drosophila extracts (TableI). To achieve a partial purification of the Drosophila TPP II activity, we used the purification procedure that was previously designed for partial purification of TPP II from rat liver (7Bålöw R.-M. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11622-11628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sepharose CL-4B followed by DEAE-cellulose chromatography produced a 70-fold purification, and 48% total recovery, of TPP II-like activity from the extract (Fig. 1 and Table I). In the Sepharose CL-4B chromatography, the enzyme eluted at a K av of 0.26, which is comparable to the value for the purified mammalian enzyme (7Bålöw R.-M. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11622-11628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bålöw R.-M. Tomkinson B. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2409-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tomkinson B. Hansen M. Cheung W.-F. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This indicates that, like the mammalian enzyme, the native M r is above 106 for theDrosophila enzyme and suggests that oligomeric dTPP II-included complexes are formed (Fig. 1 A). Unlike mammalian TPP II, the Drosophila enzyme was not retained by the DEAE-cellulose column. Based upon the dTPP II gene sequence (see below) the deduced isoelectric point is 7.0 for the dTPP II enzyme, compared with 6.2 for the human enzyme. The prediction of a higher isoelectric point for dTPP II is consistent with the observation that it does not bind under these conditions (Fig. 1 C). Nevertheless, a large portion of the contaminating proteins did bind the anion exchanger, and a significant purification factor was achieved (Table I) as illustrated by the silver-stained gel (Fig. 2). We monitored the extent of dTPP II purification using an antibody raised against the human TPP II (29Tomkinson B. Nyberg F. Neurochem. Res. 1995; 20: 1443-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed a ∼150,000-Da band co-eluting with the enzyme activity in the Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 1 B and Fig. 2). Following the DEAE chromatography (Fig. 2), the active fractions retained the same ∼150-kDa TPP II immunoreactive band. This size is consistent with that predicted by the dTPP II sequence (see below). A few additional immunoreactive bands of lower molecular weight also co-purified with the enzyme activity; these may represent partially degraded subunits still incorporated in the high molecular weight complex and/or other cross-reacting proteins. Immunoreactive bands of lower molecular weight were also seen in the purification of human TPP II (8Bålöw R.-M. Tomkinson B. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2409-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Tomkinson B. Zetterqvist Ö. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 149-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found a higher specific activity in extracts from embryos (0.83 units/μg) as compared with adult Drosophila. The same purification scheme applied to the embryonic extracts produced an overall purification of only 40-fold. In preliminary experiments, the enzyme preparation from the embryo and adult tissues behaved identically with respect to substrate specificity and inhibitor sensitivity (data not shown). Due to its greater purity, the enzyme preparation derived from adult tissue was selected for further characterization. In order to characterize further the partially purified dTPP II, we investigated its pH optimum, substrate specificity, inhibitor sensitivity, and kinetics. The optimal pH for cleavage of the standard substrate AAF-pNA was between 7.5 and 7.8 (data not shown). For comparison, the mammalian enzyme has a pH optimum of 7.5 with the hexapeptide Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser(P)-Val-Ala as the substrate (7Bålöw R.-M. Ragnarsson U. Zetterqvist Ö. J. Biol.

Chem. 1986; 261: 2409-2417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This feature differentiates TPP II from the lysosomal enzyme TPP I that prefers an acidic environment (35Doebber T.W. Divor A.R. Ellis S. Endocrinology. 1978; 103: 1794-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 36Page A.E. Fuller K. Chambers T.J. Warburton M.J. Arch. Biochem.

The sequential cleavage of a larger substrate to form a series of tripeptides is the defining nature of a tripeptidyl peptidase. The tripeptidyl peptidase specificity of the partially purified dTPP II was confirmed by cleavage of the nonapeptide Gly-Val-Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Val-Ala. Fig. 3 shows that the major products corresponded to tripeptides cleaved sequentially from the N terminus of the nonapeptide. No additional cleavage products were detected. To pursue the hypothesis that the activity contains a true tripeptidyl peptidase, we used the chromogenic substrates Ala-pNA, Phe-pNA, and Suc-Ala-Ala-Phe-pNA (Table II). None of these substrates were cleaved at a detectable rate by the p"
https://openalex.org/W130618297,The author executive director of the Joint UN Program on HIV/AIDS calls for a redirection of current biomedical research in this area with an emphasis on technologies that are both globally relevant and affordable. Scientific progress related to HIV/AIDS has been of little benefit to the millions of men women and children in poor countries who lack access to antiretroviral combinations or drugs to prevent vertical HIV transmission. In general the societal response to the AIDS epidemic has lagged behind advances in biomedical research. Programs with documented effectiveness--school-based sex education condom promotion and needle exchange for example--have not been widely implemented. The AIDS crisis has potential to provide a new paradigm for the interaction between science and society caregivers and patients and public health agencies and affected communities. However this demands a new culture of international cooperation with increased emphasis on sustaining social interventions and strengthening research institutions. Ethical questions on how to ensure high research standards in developing country settings where health resources are severely limited must be addressed. Over the long term development of an effective HIV vaccine will be the touchstone of global commitment to the application of science to a social good.
https://openalex.org/W1997724687,"We previously reported that the transcription of the human macrophage stimulating protein (MSP) gene was positively regulated by the binding of NF-Y to the CAATT sequence in the promoter region of this gene. Here we confirmed our previous results and further characterized the MSP promoter. Luciferase assay with deletion constructs showed the importance of the region, +32 to +39, for the promoter activity in Hep3B cells. Two nuclear protein-DNA probe (+15 to +40) complexes, C1 and C2, were detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. C2 was specific to hepatoma cells and contained hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4). DNase I footprinting with recombinant HNF-4 located another HNF-4-binding site in the distal region, −89 to −54. Mutations in the CAATT or the proximal HNF-4-binding site significantly reduced the promoter activity in Hep3B cells and HNF-4-transfected HeLa cells, whereas mutations in the distal HNF-4-binding site had no effect. The close proximity between the CAATT and the proximal HNF-4-binding site suggested that a direct contact between NF-Y and HNF-4 might be important. Protein-protein interaction between the A-subunit of NF-Y and HNF-4 was detected by a yeast two-hybrid system. The binding of in vitro translated HNF-4 to immobilized NF-YA and in vitro translated NF-YA to immobilized HNF-4 was also detected. These results suggest the binding of HNF-4 to the proximal HNF-4-binding site directs the basal transcription of theMSP gene, and the maximal promoter activity may depend on the direct association between HNF-4 and NF-Y.

We and others (2Yoshimura T. Yuhki N. Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15461-15468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Han S. Stuart L.A. Degen S.J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9768-9780Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) previously reported that MSP mRNA was predominantly and constitutively expressed in the liver, probably in hepatic cells. The transcriptional mechanisms of genes specifically expressed in hepatic cells, such as albumin, transthyretin, α1-antitrypsin, or fibrinogen, have been previously investigated (11Lai E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 427-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In most of the cases, transcription of these genes is positively regulated by liver-specific transcriptional factors such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) (12Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F.

Gene Dev. 1990; 4: 2353-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Recently, we cloned the 5′-flanking region of the human MSP gene and found that the transcription of the human MSP gene was regulated by positive and negative regulatory elements (PRE and NRE) (16Ueda A. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20265-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The PRE was located in the region between 34 and +2 and was essential for the maximal transcription of this gene. This sequence carried the “CCAAT” sequence and was the binding site for the ubiquitously expressedtrans-activator, MSP-PRE-binding protein-1, and MSP-PRE-binding protein-2 (identical to NF-Y/CCAAT-binding factor) (16Ueda A. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20265-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The NRE was located in the region between −141 and −34 and appeared to be responsible for the tissue-specific expression of this gene. Waltz et al. (17Waltz S.E. Gould F.K. Air E.L. McDowell S.A. Degen S.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9024-9032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) also investigated the mechanisms of the human MSP gene transcription. There were significant differences between the data obtained by two groups. Waltz et al. (17Waltz S.E. Gould F.K. Air E.L. McDowell S.A. Degen S.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9024-9032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) identified putative transcription initiation sites at −75 and −76 (corresponding to −27 and −28 in out study), located on the CCAAT sequence, by using RNA from HepG2 cells transfected with the pL5CAT (−1348/+1) chimeric construct, but they could not obtain primer extension products from RNA isolated from untransfected HepG2 cells. Waltz et al. (17Waltz S.E. Gould F.K. Air E.L. McDowell S.A. Degen S.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9024-9032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) also reported that the binding of HNF-4 to the region between −135 and −105 (corresponding to −98 and −69 in our study) activated the transcription of this gene (17Waltz S.E. Gould F.K. Air E.L. McDowell S.A. Degen S.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9024-9032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The binding of HNF-4 to the region was shown by EMSA and supershift.trans-Activity of HNF-4 was demonstrated with a CAT construct, pL5CAT5 (−135/−105), constructed by ligating the sequence between −135 and −105 to the upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in pBLCAT5. The thymidine kinase promoter contained TATA box, whereas the wild-type MSP promoter does not contain TATA box. Thus, the presence of TATA box in pL5CAT 5 (−135/−105) could influence the outcome of their experiments. After the publication of our results (16Ueda A. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20265-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we further characterized the PRE and NRE by DNase I protection assay. Two distinct footprints were detected with Hep3B cell nuclear extracts. One was the region between −33 and −4 that included the CCAAT sequence, and the other was the region between −80 and −65. In contrast, a broad region between −104 and −4 was protected with HeLa or HOS nuclear extracts. By EMSA and supershift assay, we confirmed that HNF-4 bound to the region between −80 and −65 as shown by Waltz et al. (17Waltz S.E. Gould F.K. Air E.L. McDowell S.A. Degen S.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9024-9032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of HOS cells with an HNF-4 expression vector and a vector containing 1 kilobase pair of the MSP promoter fused to theCAT gene dose-dependently increased CAT activity, suggesting that the binding of HNF-4 to this region was important for the tissue-specific expression of MSP mRNA. However, it was surprising that the deletion of the HNF-4 binding sequence from the pMD1k or mutation on the HNF-4 binding sequence did not affect the promotor activity of the MSP gene in Hep3B, HepG2, and HNF-4-transfected HOS cells. 2A. Ueda and T. Yoshimura, unpublished data. 2A. Ueda and T. Yoshimura, unpublished data.Thus, although some of our results agreed with that reported by Waltzet al. (17Waltz S.E. Gould F.K. Air E.L. McDowell S.A. Degen S.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9024-9032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we could not explain tissue-specific expression of MSP mRNA simply by the binding of HNF-4 to the previously reported HNF-4-binding site. There appear to be other mechanisms that regulate tissue-specific expression of MSP mRNA. As described above, the 5′-region of the MSP gene does not contain TATA box. In promoters that do not have TATA box, an initiator (Inr) is functionally analogous to TATA and capable of directing basal transcription by RNA polymerase II (18Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 19Kaufmann J. Smale S.T. Gene Dev. 1994; 8: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the promoter region of the MSP gene, a sequence similar to the weak consensus sequence for the Inr (−3YYCAYYYYY+6) (18Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar) was found between +23 and +31. In our preliminary study, deletion of the region between −5 and +49 resulted in a significant decrease (1/20) in the CAT activity in Hep3B cells. In contrast, deletion of the region between +37 and +49 had no effect, suggesting that the region between −5 and +36 could be functionally important for the promoter activity. In the present study, we first repeated CAT assay to confirm our previous results that suggested that the transcription of theMSP gene was regulated by PRE and NRE. After the confirmation of our previous results, we further analyzed theMSP promoter located between −5 and +49 and found that the binding of HNF-4 to the sequence between +32 and +39 was critical for the basal transcription of this gene, and the maximal promoter activity depended on the cooperation between HNF-4 and NF-Y.

Hep3B and HepG2 hepatoma cells were cultured in minimum essential medium containing 10% FCS. Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FCS. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transiently transfected with 15 μg of each luciferase construct and 5 μg of pSV-β galactosidase plasmid DNA per 100-mm tissue culture plate by a calcium phosphate precipitation technique (20Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar). After 24 h incubation with each DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in fresh medium for another 48 h. The cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured by the luciferase assay system. The resulting luciferase activity was corrected based on the β-galactosidase activity in the same cell extract. CAT constructs, pMD5.3k, pMD1.5k, pMD1k, pMD223, pMD141, pMD34, and pM2, were described previously (16Ueda A. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20265-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To obtain additional 5′-deletion CAT constructs, pMD121, pMD101 and pMD81, DNA fragments covering from −121 to +49, −101 to +49, or −81 to +49 were amplified by PCR with sense oligonucleotide primers that corresponded to the region from −121 to −102 (primer −121, 5′-GGCTGCAGTGGGACCTGAGGCCTGGCCC-3′), from −101 to −82 (primer −101, 5′-GGCTGCAGCTCATGGCTCCTGTCACCAG-3′), and from −81 to −62 (primer −81, 5′-GGCTGCAGTCTCAGGTCAGGGTCCAGC-3′) with an antisense probe from +30 to +49 (5′-GGTCTAGACCTTCTGGCTGGAGGCTGCA-3′). PstI orXbaI linkers were incorporated in the 5′-ends of these primers. The pMD1k was used as the PCR template. The PCR products were subcloned into the PstI-XbaI site of the pCAT basic vector after digestion with PstI andXbaI. To obtain the pGLMD1k containing the wild-type MSP promoter, the 1-kilobase pair 5′-flanking region, between −967 and +49, of the human MSP gene was PCR-amplified with a sense primer D967 (5′-GGGGTACCCGGACCGCGAAGGGAATA-3′) and an antisense primer 49 (5′-GGAGATCTCCTTCTGGCTGGAGGCTGCA-3′) by using the pMD5k plasmid (16Ueda A. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20265-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as a template. KpnI or BglII linkers were incorporated in the 5′-end of these primers. This PCR product was gel-purified, digested with BglII and KpnI, and then ligated into the BglII-KpnI site of the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). To obtain 3′-deletion mutants, pGLM38, pGLM31, pGLM26, and pGLM15, DNA fragments covering from −967 to +38, −967 to +31, −967 to +26, or −967 to +15 were amplified by PCR with a sense oligonucleotide primer, D967, with an antisense probe that corresponded to the region from +19 to +38 (primer 38, 5′-GGGAGATCTGAGGCTGCACTGTGACCCCA-3′), from +12 to +31 (primer 31, 5′-GGGAGATCTCACTGTGACCCCACCACAGC-3′), from +7 to +26 (primer 26, 5′-GGGAGATCTGACCCCACCACAGCCCATCC-3′), and from −5 to +15 (primer 15, 5′-GGGAGATCTCAGCCCATCCGGGAAGTTGT-3′). The PCR products were gel-purified, digested with BglII and KpnI, and then ligated into the BglII-KpnI site of the pGL3-basic plasmid. Mutated constructs, pmDH, pmY, pm1PH, pm2PH, pm3PH, pm4PH, and pm5PH, were obtained by a two-step PCR mutagenesis method (21Baowei C. Alan E.D. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 657-659PubMed Google Scholar) with chemically synthesized mutated sense oligonucleotides, mDH (5′- CTGTCACCAGGTCgacGGTCAGGG-3′), mY (5′-GCCACCgAaTcCCGTAGGGA-3′), and m1PH (5′-GGTTTCACAACTTCCCGGATGGGCTGTGGcccGGTC-3′), m2PH (5′-TGGTGGGGatcCAGTGCAGCCTCCAGCCAG-3′), m3PH (5′-TGGTGGGGTCACAGctgAGCCTCCAGCCAG-3′), m4PH (5′-TGGTGGGGTCACAGTGCAggaTCCAGCCAG-3′), and m5PH (5′-CACAGTGCAGCCTCCctgCAGAAGGAGATCT-3′).

The coding region of the human HNF-4 cDNA was amplified by PCR from the pMT7HNF-4 (generous gift from Dr. F. M. Sladek, University of California, Riverside, CA) and subcloned into the pcDNA3 (pcHNF4) and pET32a. The murine p65 expression vector CMV-LDp65 and human p50 expression vector CMV-399 (this vector coded amino acids 1 to 399 of p50) were provided by Dr. N. Rice (NCI-FCRDC, Frederick, MD). In vitro coupled transcription and translation were performed with the TnT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to a protocol provided by the supplier. Briefly, 1 μg of each pcDNA3 vector containing a different cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase were added to a 50-μl reaction mix and then the mix was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. For radiolabeling,l-[35S]methionine was used at final activity of 0.8 μCi/μl. Recombinant proteins were induced in the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain by addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 16 h at room temperature. The bacteria were lysed by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. After ultracentrifugation, the clear bacterial lysates were applied onto a His·Bind Resin column. The bound proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole and dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For protein-protein interaction assay, histidine-tagged HNF-4, NF-YA, and NF-YB were immobilized on His·Bind Resin in buffer B at 4 °C. The resin was packed in Pasteur pipettes, and the columns were washed with 10 volumes of the buffer. The columns were loaded with in vitro translated 35S-labeled HNF-4, NF-YB, NF-κB p50, or RelA and then rinsed with binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 2% polyethylene glycol 8000). The columns were washed extensively with the binding buffer containing 30 mmimidazole. After the final wash, the bound proteins were eluted with 300 mm imidazole and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To prepare the coding strand DNA carrying the MSP promoter region (−141 to +49), the pMD141 plasmid (16Ueda A. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20265-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was digested with HindIII, and the overhangs were filled in with [32P]dCTP, followed by a digestion with EcoRI. The resulting 350-base pair fragment was purified after gel electrophoresis. To prepare the noncoding strand DNA, the pGLMD141 was digested with NcoI, and the overhangs were filled in with [32P]dCTP, followed by a digestion with PstI. The resulting 243-base pair fragment was purified after gel electrophoresis. DNase I digestion was performed with 4 ng of the coding or noncoding strand DNA and bacterially expressed recombinant HNF-4 protein by the method described by Lefevre et al. (25Lefevre C. Imagawa M. Dana S. Grindlay J. Bodner M. Karin M. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and the digested samples were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels. EMSA was carried out as previously reported (16Ueda A. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20265-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Ueda A. Okuda K. Ohno S. Shirai A. Igarashi T. Matsunaga K. Fukushima J. Kawamoto S. Ishigatsubo Y. Okubo T. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2052-2063PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the probes were prepared by annealing each sense oligonucleotide with antisense oligonucleotide shown in Table I. The binding reaction was performed at 20 °C for 30 min in 10 ml of 1× binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 14% glycerol, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 10 fmol of each probe end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, 1 μg of dI-dC, and 3 μg of each nuclear extract. For the competition assay, 10-, 20-, or 50-fold excess amounts of appropriate unlabeled probes were added to the binding reaction mixtures. For supershift assay, nuclear extract was preincubated with 1 μl of normal rabbit serum or antiserum for 20 min before mixing with the probe. Gel electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V for 2 h after a prerun at 200 V for 30 min.Table IOligonucleotides used in the EMSAsProbeSequenceRef.−83/−645′-AGGTCTCAGGTCAGGGTCCTCCAGAGTCCAGTCCCAGG-5′c/EBPα5′-TGCAGATTGCGCAATCTGCA12Landschulz W.H.

Briefly, the full-length cDNAs for NF-YA, NF-YB, NF-YC, and TFIIB were obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The cDNAs for HNF-4, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC were ligated into theNcoI-EcoRI site, and the TFIIB cDNA was ligated into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the pAS2-1 vector carrying the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DNA-BD) (27Harper J.W.

To investigate interactions between two transcription factors, a yeast strain, Y187 (MATa, trp 1, leu 2, URA3::GAL1USA-GAL1TATA-LACZ), was transformed with various combinations of the pAS2-1 vector coding different GAL4 DNA-BD fusion proteins and the pACT2 coding different GAL4 transcriptional AD fusion proteins. β-Galactosidase activity in the yeast was assayed by colony-lift filter assay as qualitative assay and by liquid culture assay as quantitative assay (29Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 30Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development.

For colony-lift assay, yeast colonies were streaked out onto synthetic dropout selection agar plates without leucine or tryptophan, and the plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. Sterile VWR filters presoaked in Z buffer/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactosidase were placed on the plates. The filters were lifted carefully and submerged in liquid nitrogen for 10 s. The filters were thawed at room temperature and placed on presoaked filters and then incubated at 30 °C until blue color appeared. For liquid culture assay, yeast colonies were inoculated into 5 ml of synthetic dropout without leucine or tryptophan and cultured overnight at 30 °C with shaking. Two ml of the overnight cultures were inoculated into 8 ml of YPD liquid, and the cells were grown at 30 °C for 3–5 h with shaking until the A 600reached 0.5–0.8. One and a half ml of the cultures were transferred into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and the tubes were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 30 s. After removal of the supernatants, cells were washed and finally resuspended in 0.3 ml of Z buffer. One hundred μl of the cell suspensions were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes and placed in liquid nitrogen until the cells were frozen. The cells were thawed at 37 °C, and 700 μl of Z buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol were added to the tubes. One hundred sixty μl ofo-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml in Z buffer) were added to each tube, and the tubes were incubated at 30 °C. When the yellow color developed, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.4 ml of 1 m Na2CO3. The tubes were centrifuged, and the supernatants were subjected to spectrophotometry at A 420. As described in the Introduction, our previous results on the cis-element responsible for the positive regulation of the MSP gene transcription were significantly different from that by Waltz et al. (17Waltz S.E. Gould F.K. Air E.L. McDowell S.A. Degen S.J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9024-9032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first repeated CAT assay with previously constructed CAT constructs containing different lengths of the 5′-flanking region of the MSP gene obtained by progressive deletion of the 5′-end (16Ueda A. Yoshimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20265-20272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and also with newly created CAT constructs (Fig. 1 B). A significant CAT activity was detected in the extracts of Hep3B cells transfected with pMD5.3k. Progressive deletion of the 5′-flanking region from −5.3k (pMD5.3k) to −34 (pMD34) resulted in a gradual increase in CAT activity. In contrast, no significant CAT activity was found in HeLa cells transfected with either pMD5.3k or other constructs containing the 5′-flanking regions progressively deleted up to −141. However, when the 5′-flanking region was deleted to −121, −101, or −81, CAT activity was increased 2.5-fold. Further deletion from −81 to −34 resulted in another 2-fold increase in CAT activity. These results suggested that the region between −141 and −34 might negatively regulate the transcription of the MSP gene. In both cells, deletion to +2 (pM2) resulted in a significant decrease in CAT activity. The region between −34 and +2 carries the CAATT sequence we previously identified as an NF-Y-binding site. Removal of the remaining proximal MSP gene sequence (pCAT-basic) resulted in a total loss of CAT activity, suggesting that the proximal 5′-flanking region between +2 and +49 may also be responsible for the positive regulation of the MSP gene transcription. Thus, these results further support our hypothesis that the transcription of the MSP gene is regulated by PRE and NRE. To characterize the putative regulatory element located in the region between +2 and +49, we constructed additional luciferase plasmid constructs (Fig. 1 C). High luciferase activities were detected in Hep3B cells transfected with either pGLMD1k or pGLM38. However, luciferase activities were significantly decreased when the 3′-sequen"
https://openalex.org/W2053027343,"Earlier studies from our laboratory showed that a secreted binding protein for fibroblast growth factors (FGF-BP) is expressed at high levels in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines. Overexpression studies or conversely reduced expression of FGF-BP by ribozyme targeting have elucidated a direct role of this protein in angiogenesis during tumor development. We have also observed a significant up-regulation of FGF-BP during TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) promotion of skin cancer. Here we investigate the mechanism of TPA induction of FGF-BP gene expression in the human ME-180 SCC cell line. We found that TPA increased FGF-BP mRNA levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner mediated via the protein kinase C signal transduction pathway. Results from actinomycin D and cycloheximide experiments as well as nuclear transcription assays revealed that TPA up-regulated the steady-state levels of FGF-BP mRNA by increasing its rate of gene transcription independently ofde novo protein synthesis. We isolated the human FGF-BP promoter and determined by deletion analysis that TPA regulatory elements were all contained in the first 118 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Further mutational analysis revealed that full TPA induction required interplay between several regulatory elements with homology to Ets, AP-1, and CAATT/enhancer binding protein C/EBP sites. In addition, deletion or mutation of a 10-base pair region juxtaposed to the AP-1 site dramatically increased TPA induced FGF-BP gene expression. This region represses the extent of the FGF-BP promoter response to TPA and contained sequences recognized by the family of E box helix-loop-helix transcription factors. Gel shift analysis showed specific and TPA-inducible protein binding to the Ets, AP-1, and C/EBP sites. Furthermore, distinct, specific, and TPA-inducible binding to the imperfect E box repressor element was also apparent. Overall, our data indicate that TPA effects on FGF-BP gene transcription are tightly controlled by a complex interplay of positive elements and a novel negative regulatory element.

Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGF-BP mRNA has been found to be up-regulated in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines of different origin, in SCC tumor samples from the head and neck, and in some colon cancer cell lines (1Wu D. Kan M. Sato G.H. Okamoto T. Sato J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16778-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, developmental expression of the mouse FGF-BP gene was found to be prominent in the skin and intestine during the perinatal phase and is down-regulated in adult mice (3Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We previously described that expression of FGF-BP in a non-tumorigenic human cell line (SW-13) which expresses bFGF leads to a tumorigenic and angiogenic phenotype (2Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of FGF-BP in these cells solubilizes their endogenous bFGF from its extracellular storage and allows it to reach its receptor, suggesting that FGF-BP serves as an extracellular carrier molecule for bFGF (2Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rak J. Kerbel R.S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1083-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Expression of FGF-BP under the control of a tetracycline-responsive promoter system in SW-13 cells revealed its role during the early phase of tumor growth (5Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Schulte A.M. Cardillo M. Wellstein A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 930-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To assess the significance of FGF-BP endogenously expressed in tumors, we depleted human SCC (ME-180) and colon carcinoma (LS174T) cell lines of their FGF-BP by targeting with specific ribozymes (6Czubayko F. Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Aigner A. Tuveson A.T. Berchem G. Wellstein A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1137-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This study showed that the reduction of FGF-BP reduced the release of biologically active bFGF from cells in culture. In addition, the growth and angiogenesis of xenografted tumors in mice was decreased in parallel with the reduction of FGF-BP, suggesting that some human tumors can utilize FGF-BP as an angiogenic switch molecule. The fact that FGF-BP has been detected in only a few types of tumors, where it seems to play a crucial role in angiogenesis, led us to investigate the mechanisms responsible for turning its expression on or off. Studying the regulation of FGF-BP in SCC cell lines, we showed that all-trans-retinoic acid, used as a chemotherapeutic agent against SCCs, down-regulates FGF-BP gene expression in vitro by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (7Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21303-21308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In vivo all-trans-retinoic acid treatment reduces FGF-BP expression in SCC xenografts and inhibits their tumor growth and angiogenesis (8Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Berchem G.J. Wellstein A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 179-184PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, FGF-BP mRNA expression in the adult mouse skin was found to be dramatically increased during the early stages of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/TPA-induced mouse skin papilloma formation (3Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), as well as in 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene/TPA-treated human skin grafted onto SCID mice. 2A. Aigner and A. Wellstein, unpublished data. Similarly, FGF-BP expression in vitro was up-regulated in epidermal cell lines carrying an activated ras gene, implicating the ras/PKC pathway in the regulation of FGF-BP (3Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this context, and given the fact that FGF-BP could play a critical role in the development of human skin cancer, we decided to investigate the effects of the tumor promoter TPA on FGF-BP gene regulation. Our results show that FGF-BP mRNA expression is up-regulated by TPA in the ME-180 SCC cell line and that this induction is mediated by direct transcriptional mechanisms. Analysis of the human FGF-BP promoter reveals that the TPA induction is mediated by cooperation of several inducible regulatory elements. Furthermore, the induction of gene expression by TPA can be modified by a repressor element juxtaposed to the AP-1 site which contains sequences recognized by E box element factors. The ME-180 squamous cell carcinoma cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). Cells were cultured in improved minimum essential medium (Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). ME-180 cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150-mm tissue culture dishes, washed three times in serum-free IMEM, and then treated 16 h later with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (Sigma) in serum-free IMEM. Total RNA was isolated with the RNA STAT-60 method using commercially available reagents and protocols (RNA STAT-60TM, Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). 30 μg of total RNA were separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and then blotted onto nylon membranes (MSI, Westboro, MA). The blots were prehybridized in 6× SSC (0.9 m sodium chloride, 0.09m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.5% (w/v) SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% (w/v) Ficoll, 0.1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA) (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 4 h at 42 °C. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42 °C in the same buffer. After hybridization, blots were washed three times with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 10 min at 42 °C and finally once with 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS for 20 min at 65 °C. Autoradiography was performed using intensifying screens at −70 °C. Blots were stripped by boiling 2 × for 10 min in 1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. Hybridization probes were prepared by random-primed DNA labeling (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) of purified insert fragments from human FGF-BP (2Czubayko F. Smith R.V. Chung H.C. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28243-28248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human GAPDH (CLONTECH). The final concentration of the labeled probes was always greater than 106 cpm/ml hybridization solution. Quantitation of mRNA levels was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). ME-180 cells were grown to 80% confluence on 150-mm tissue culture dishes. Cells were washed three times in serum-free IMEM and then treated 16 h later with TPA in serum-free IMEM for indicated times. Nuclei from 107 cells for each time point were isolated after incubation in lysis buffer containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 as described (7Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21303-21308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nuclear transcription assays were performed with [α-32P]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (7Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21303-21308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of radioactivity (0.5–1 × 107cpm) were hybridized to nitrocellulose filters containing 3 μg of each plasmid. After hybridization for 4 days at 42 °C, the filters were washed 4 times with 2X SSPE, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at 25 °C and treated for 30 min at 25 °C in 2X SSPE containing 20 μg/ml RNase A. The filters were then washed 4 times for 30 min in 1X SSPE, 1% SDS at 65 °C. The amount of radioactivity present in each slot was determined using a PhosphorImager after overnight exposure, and autoradiograms were exposed for 1–3 days with intensifying screens. Primer 1 was designed from the coding region of the human FGF-BP cDNA (5′-GTGAGGCTACAGATCTTC-3′), primer 2 from the FGF-BP 5′-UTR (5′-GTTCACCTTGTTCTGAGCACACGGATCCA-3′), and a control primer for the 1.2-kb kanamycin RNA (Promega). 10 pmol of each primer was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and 30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h, and labeled primers were purified over a ChromaSpin-10 gel filtration column (CLONTECH). Total RNA from ME-180 cells was isolated as described for Northern analysis. ME-180 mRNA was purified from total RNA over an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (Life Technologies, Inc). 100 fmol of each FGF-BP-specific primer was incubated with or without 7 μg of ME-180 mRNA or control primer with or without 2 ng of 1.2-kb kanamycin control RNA (Promega) in the presence of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.5, Boehringer Mannheim) and allowed to anneal for 1 h at 50 °C. Annealed mixtures were then incubated in the presence of 2 mm dNTPs, 50 units of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim), and 40 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at 42 °C. Samples were then run on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel along with radiolabeled HinfI markers and exposed overnight for autoradiography. 1.8 kb of genomic sequence lying upstream of the human FGF-BP gene was isolated from a human genomic library using the PCR-based PromoterFinder DNA Walking Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's recommendations using rTth XL DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Gene-specific primers derived from the 5′-UTR of the human FGF-BP cDNA were 5′-ACACGGATCCAGTGCAATCC-3′ (+91 to +72) for the primary round of PCR and 5′-GGAGTGAATTGCAGGCTGCAGCTGTGTCAG-3′ (+62 to +33) for secondary PCR. Secondary PCR products from a DraI library (1.1 kb) and PvuII library (1.8 kb) were cloned into a TA Cloning Vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen), sequenced by automated cycle sequencing (ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing, Perkin-Elmer), and confirmed to contain contiguous genomic sequence. This sequence has been submitted to GenBankTM (accession numberAF062639). Promoter fragments were cloned into the PXP1 promoterless luciferase reporter vector (9Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-456PubMed Google Scholar). PCR products fromPvuII (−1829/+62) and DraI (−1060/+62) libraries were removed from pCR2.1 using HindIII andXhoI sites in the pCR2.1 multiple cloning site and ligated into the HindIII and XhoI site of PXP1 to generate pX-1829/+62Luc and pX-1060/+62Luc. Both constructs contained aBamHI site carried over from the pCR2.1 vector and located 3′ of the FGF-BP sequence and 5′ of the luciferase gene. The 5′ promoter deletion constructs pX-118/+62Luc, pX-93/+62Luc, pX-77/+62Luc, pX-67/+62Luc, pX-56/+62Luc, and pX-31/+62Luc were generated by PCR from pX-1060/+62 Luc template using upstream primers spanning −118 to −100, −93 to −76, −77 to −59, −67 to −49, −56 to −35, and −31 to −11, respectively, all containing a 5′-linked BamHI site. Downstream primer was derived from the luciferase gene 5′-CCATCCTCTAGAGGATAGAATGGCGCCGGGCC-3′. PCR was carried out usingTaq DNA Polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). Products were cut with BamHI, gel-purified, and cloned into the PXP1BamHI site. Correct sequence and orientation were verified by dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing with a Sequenase kit 2.0 (U.S. Biochemical). Internal promoter deletions were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. Complementary overlapping oligonucleotides containing specific promoter deletions were generated as follows. Ets site deletion from −76 to −67 was incorporated into primers spanning −58 to −93 and −85 to −47; AP-1 site deletion from −65 to −58 was incorporated into primers spanning −47 to −83 and −72 to −35; Ets/AP-1 site deletion from −76 to −58 was incorporated into primers spanning −49 to −93 and −85 to −36; C/EBPβ site deletion from −47 to −33 was incorporated into primers spanning −24 to −66 and −57 to −11; and deletion from −57 to −47 was incorporated into primers spanning −35 to −75 and −69 to −27. The −58 point mutant was made by incorporating a C to T point mutation at position −58 into primers representing both strands from −70 to −51. For each construct, two separate PCR reactions were carried out with either theBamHI-linked −118 to −99 upstream primer or the luciferase-specific downstream primer. The products were separated from excess primers and mixed, denatured, and allowed to reanneal. Amplification of the heteroduplex with overlapping 3′ ends was carried out by 3′ extension in the absence of primers followed by amplification using outside primers (BamHI-linked −118 to −99 primer and Luciferase-specific primer) in a secondary round of PCR. Final PCR products were digested with BamHI, gel-purified, and ligated into the PXP1 BamHI site. Correct sequence and orientation were verified by dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing with a Sequenase kit 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To control for TPA effects on vector sequences unrelated to the FGF-BP promoter insert, we tested a number of non-TPA responsive promoters inserted into the PXP 1 vector for their response to TPA under the conditions used in our experiments. Control vectors, as seen in Fig. 6, consisted of fragments of the pro-opiomelanocortin promoter (10Riegel A.T. Lu Y. Remenick J. Wolford R.G. Berard D.S. Hager G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1973-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the thymidine kinase minimal promoter (9Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-456PubMed Google Scholar), or the CMV minimal promoter which were cloned into PXP1 vector. All these vectors demonstrated an approximately 2-fold induction after TPA treatment (see “Results”). 24 h before transfection, ME-180 cells were plated in 6-well plates in IMEM, 10% FBS at a density of 750,000 cells/well. For each transfection, 1.0 μg FGF-BP-luciferase construct and 10 μl of LipofectAMINE Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) were combined in 200 μl of IMEM, and liposome-DNA complexes were allowed to form at room temperature for 30 min. Volume was increased to 1 ml with IMEM, added to rinsed cells, and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and incubated in IMEM for 3 h and then treated for 18 h with vehicle alone (Me2SO, final concentration 0.1%) or 10−7m TPA. Transfection efficiency for each construct was determined by co-transfection with 1.0 ng of a CMV-drivenRenilla luciferase reporter vector pRL-CMV (Promega) and found to be the same for all BP-PXP1 constructs. However, due to a 2-fold background TPA induction of pRL-CMV (see above), results were normalized for protein content and not for Renillaluciferase activity. Cells were lysed by scraping into 150 μl of Passive Lysis buffer (Promega), and cell debris was removed by brief centrifugation. 20 μl of extract was assayed for both firefly andRenilla luciferase activity using the Dual-LuciferaseTM Reporter assay system (Promega). Light intensity was measured in a Monolight 2010 luminometer. Light units are expressed firefly light units/μg of protein. Protein content of cell extracts was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). ME-180 cells were grown to 80% confluency on 150-mm dishes, serum-starved for 6 h, and treated with or without 10−7m TPA for 90 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (11Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (15 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) (12Rice N.R. Ernst M.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4685-4695Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) with 1× CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer Mannheim) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Crude nuclei were pelleted at 700 g and resuspended in 50 μl of ice-cold buffer C (0.42 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1× CompleteTMprotease inhibitor mixture) and vortexed at 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 × g, supernatant was used directly in binding assays and stored at −70 °C. 4.8 pmol of each synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, and labeled primers were purified over a G-25 Sephadex column (Boehringer Mannheim). Binding reactions consisted of 2.5 μg (−80/−63 probe) or 5 μg of ME-180 nuclear extracts, binding buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mmDTT, 0.1 mm EDTA), and 200 ng of poly(dI-dC) (−80/−63 and −70/−51 probes) or 1.0 μg of poly(dA-dT) (−55/−30 probe) and incubated for 10 min on ice. Unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added and incubated for another 10 min before adding 20 fmol of labeled probe. Reactions were carried out 45 min on ice and analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 1× TBE buffer at 80 V. The AP-1 consensus sequence was 5′-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′. We have previously detected an up-regulation of FGF-BP mRNA following TPA treatment of mouse skin during the development of skin tumors (3Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and also in human skin xenografts.2 These data suggest that the control of this angiogenic switch factor may play an important role in skin carcinogenesis. To examine this further we studied the effect of the tumor promoter TPA on FGF-BP gene expression in ME-180 cells which express high levels of the FGF-BP transcript (7Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21303-21308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 10−7m TPA from 1 to 24 h which resulted in an increase in the steady-state levels of FGF-BP mRNA detectable 1 h after treatment (Fig. 1 A). PhosphorImager analysis showed that the induction was maximal after 6 h by 452 ± 44% (Fig. 1 A). GAPDH mRNA remained unaffected by TPA treatment, as judged relative to the total amount of RNA loaded and was used to standardize FGF-BP mRNA. The dose dependence of TPA induction of FGF-BP mRNA in ME-180 is shown in Fig. 1 B. We estimated the half-maximal effective concentration as 1 nm. The inductive effect of TPA on FGF-BP mRNA was also observed in two other SCC cell lines, FaDu and A431 (data not shown) demonstrating that TPA induction of FGF-BP mRNA is generally preserved in SCC cell lines. To establish whether TPA induction of FGF-BP mRNA was mediated through a PKC-dependent pathway, ME-180 cells were pretreated or not pretreated for 2 h with 100 nmhighly specific PKC inhibitor, calphostin C (13Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar), and then treated with or without 10−7m TPA for 4 h. As can be seen in Fig. 1 C, pretreatment of the cells with calphostin C prior to TPA treatment totally blocked the TPA effect, demonstrating that the induction of FGF-BP transcript by TPA is mediated via a PKC-dependent mechanism. In addition, it is known that TPA causes an immediate up-regulation of PKC followed by long term down-regulation of PKC activity. In contrast, although long term calphostin C appears to be able to down-regulate protein kinase C, it does not cause early induction of PKC activation but rather blocks the inductive effects of TPA on PKC (14Berghard A. Gradin K. Pongratz I. Whitelaw M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 677-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus the fact that Calphostin C causes no induction of FGF-BP mRNA and blocks the TPA effect argues that induction of FGF-BP mRNA is through an up-regulation of PKC activity rather than a consequence of long term down-regulation. We have previously shown that FGF-BP gene expression can be regulated through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (7Liaudet-Coopman E.D.E. Wellstein A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21303-21308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore we next attempted to determine whether the TPA induction of FGF-BP mRNA was at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. We first assessed whether TPA treatment affected the stability of the FGF-BP mRNA. Experiments were performed to determine whether addition of inhibitors of transcription (actinomycin D) or translation (cycloheximide) could inhibit the TPA induction of FGF-BP mRNA. Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) were added with or without TPA (10−7m), and FGF-BP mRNA levels were determined 6 h after treatment. As shown in Fig. 2 A, simultaneous addition of TPA and actinomycin D completely blocked the TPA induction, whereas simultaneous addition of TPA and cycloheximide had no effect. These data suggest that TPA directly increased the rate of FGF-BP gene transcription independently of de novo protein synthesis and did not affect the stability of the FGF-BP transcript. To verify further that the stability of the FGF-BP transcript was not modified by TPA treatment, ME-180 cells were pretreated for 2 h with TPA and then actinomycin D was added to inhibit transcription. As shown in Fig. 2 B, pretreatment of cells with TPA did not increase the half-life of the FGF-BP mRNA indicating that the stability of the FGF-BP transcript is not affected by TPA. To prove directly that TPA increases the rate of transcription of the FGF-BP gene, we then performed nuclear transcription run-on assays. ME-180 cells were treated with or without 10−7m TPA for various periods. 32P-Labeled nascent transcripts were prepared from isolated ME-180 cell nuclei and hybridized to a nylon membrane bearing immobilized target DNA sequences. As shown in Fig. 3, TPA increased FGF-BP transcript levels maximally after 1 h of treatment. Quantitation and normalization to β-actin showed that FGF-BP transcription was up-regulated by 647 ± 1, 448 ± 16, and 197 ± 31% after 1, 4, and 24 h of treatment, respectively (Fig. 3). β-Actin plasmid DNA was used as a control since transcription of this gene remained constant. These findings are consistent with the above results studying steady-state mRNA and the effects of actinomycin D and cycloheximide treatment. Clearly the induction of FGF-BP mRNA by TPA in ME-180 cells is directly due to a rapid up-regulation of transcription. In order to understand better the transcriptional regulation of the human FGF-BP gene, 1.8 kb of genomic sequence upstream to the known 5′-UTR sequence of human FGF-BP cDNA was isolated from a human genomic library and sequenced. The transcription start site of the human gene was determined using primer extension analysis with nested primers derived from known cDNA sequence (Fig. 4). The precise start site compatible with the primer extension results is indicated in Fig. 5. Alignment between the human and mouse FGF-BP promoter which we cloned previously (3Kurtz A. Wang H.L. Darwiche N. Harris V. Wellstein A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2671-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) revealed a region of high homology with 70% nucleotide identity within the first 200 nucleotides upstream from the transcription start (Fig. 5). Nucleotide homology dropped significantly in more upstream sequences, suggesting that the proximal conserved 200 nucleotides of the promoter could be important for transcriptional regulation of FGF-BP in both species.Figure 5Structure and homology of the human FGF-BP promoter. Top, the structure of the human FGF-BP promoter from −1829 to +62 is shown schematically.

As shown in Fig. 5, a consensus TATA box is located at about −25 base pairs upstream from the transcription start for both promoters. Between −48 and −40 of the human FGF-BP promoter we found a highly conserved consensus binding site for C/EBPβ, a member of the CCAAT/enhancer bindin"
https://openalex.org/W2009486598,"The expression of the melanin operon (melC) of Streptomyces antibioticus requires the chaperone-like protein MelC1 for the incorporation of two copper ions (designated as CuA and CuB) and the secretion of the apotyrosinase (MelC2) via a transient binary complex formation between these two proteins. To investigate whether the copper ligand of tyrosinase is involved in this MelC1.MelC2 binary complex function, six single substitution mutations were introduced into the CuA and CuB sites. These mutations led to differential effects on the stability, copper content, and export function of binary complexes but a complete abolishment of tyrosinase activity. The defects in the tyrosinase activity in mutants were not because of the impairment of the formation of MelC1. MelC2 complex but rather the failure of MelC2 to be discharged from the copper-activated binary complex. Moreover, the impairments on the discharge of the mutant MelC2 from all the mutant binary complexes appeared to result from the structural changes in their apoforms or copper-activated forms of the complexes, as evidenced by the fluorescence emission and circular dichroism spectral analysis. Therefore, each of six copper ligands in Streptomyces tyrosinase binuclear copper sites plays a pivotal role in the final maturation and the discharge of tyrosinase from the binary complex but has a less significant role in its secretion."

Cavert and Haase propose the creation of tissue banks from HIV-positive individuals who have died from other causes such as accidents or trauma.

https://openalex.org/W2154091223,"We cloned a protein phosphatase 2C gene fromParamecium (PtPP2C), which codes for one of the smallest PP2C isoforms (Klumpp, S., Hanke, C., Donella-Deana, A., Beyer, A., Kellner, R., Pinna, L. A., and Schultz, J. E. (1994)J. Biol. Chem. 269, 32774–32780). After mutation of 9 ciliate Q codons (TAA) to CAA PtPP2C was expressed as an active protein in Escherichia coli. The catalytic core region contains 284 amino acids as defined by C- and N-terminal deletions. The C terminus from amino acid 200–300 of PP2C isoforms has only about 20% similarity.

Upon proteolytic truncation enzyme activity was lost, i.e. the C terminus of PP2C is indispensable for enzyme activity. During these experiments isoleucine 214 was fortuitously identified to be essential for PP2C catalysis. Mutation of the hydrophobic amino acid to glycine in the ciliate or bovine isoforms resulted in inactive protein. Because Ile214 is in a loop region without defined secondary structure, our data clearly go beyond the x-ray structure. The functional equivalence of the 180 amino acid long C terminus from the bovine PP2C with the 100 amino acid long carboxy end of the PtPP2C was demonstrated by producing an active chimera, i.e. the PP2C from Paramecium has no obvious regions which may be specifically involved in subcellular localization or substrate recognition. Using antibodies against recombinant PtPP2C we localized the enzyme by immunogold labeling in the cytosol and nucleus and very distinctly on the ciliary microtubule/dynein complex. The data suggest a role for PtPP2C in the regulation of dyneins, i.e. in cellular cargo transport and ciliary motility. We cloned a protein phosphatase 2C gene fromParamecium (PtPP2C), which codes for one of the smallest PP2C isoforms (Klumpp, S., Hanke, C., Donella-Deana, A., Beyer, A., Kellner, R., Pinna, L.

In addition, several physiological functions of PP1, 2A, and 2B have been tentatively identified using specific inhibitors (for a review, see Cohen (5Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar)). No specific inhibitors are available for protein phosphatase 2C isozymes (PP2C) which belong to a separate family of Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent phosphatases (PPM-family) with a low degree of conservation in their primary structure (6Bork P. Brown N.P. Hegyi H. Schultz J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 7Mann D.J. Campbell D.G. McGowan C.H. Cohen P.T.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The molecular weights range from 48 kDa (fromArabidopsis thaliana; 433 amino acids) to the smallest versions of 33 kDa from Paramecium tetraurelia (300 amino acids) and 31 kDa from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (TPD1, 282 amino acids) (8Robinson M.K. van Zyl W.H. Phizicky E.M. Broach J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3634-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This large variability was suggested to indicate a functional diversity of PP2C enzymes although presently our knowledge about PP2C functions is rather limited (9Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Lately, a deletion analysis with a human liver PP2Cα isoform (382 amino acids) was reported (10Marley A.E. Sullivan J.E. Carling D. Abbott W.M. Smith G.J. Taylor I.W.F. Carey F. Beri R.K. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Two C-terminal truncations of 75 and 179 and one N-terminal deletion of 51 amino acids were constructed. Only the expression product of PP2Cα1–307 was active. This is in agreement with the recently published x-ray structure of a human PP2Cα, which shows that the C terminus starting around amino acid position 300 contains three α helices forming an appendix to the catalytic core (9Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Consequently, the C-terminal domain was speculated to affect substrate specificity. The 300-amino acid long protozoan PP2C completely lacks this C-terminal domain. How are the cellular localization and substrate specificity of PP2C defined in the ciliate? First, we determined the minimal core structure of the PtPP2C, which is essential for catalytic activity,i.e. we constructed N- and C-terminal deletion mutants at the DNA level and, additionally, C-terminal truncations via targeted proteolysis. Fortuitously, we identified an invariant isoleucine at position 214 in an unordered loop region as cardinal to enzyme activity in PP2C enzymes. Second, we assessed the functional equivalence of protozoan PP2C regions with their mammalian counterparts by generating an active bovine/ciliate chimera. Finally we localized PP2C inParamecium by immunochemical and -cytochemical methods in the cytoplasm, nucleus and the cilia. Because of the targeting of PtPP2C to motor components in the cilia we propose that PtPP2C participates in the regulation of cytoplasmic, nuclear and ciliary dynein regulation. pBluescriptII SK(+/−) and E. coli XL1 Blue were from Stratagene. All restriction enzymes and nucleases were purchased from either Boehringer Mannheim or New England Biolabs. Sequenase Version 2.0 from U. S. Biochemical Corp. was used for DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS and the plasmid pET16b were from Novagen. Point mutations were made in E. coliBMH71-18mutS from CLONTECH. Ni2+-nitriloacetate-agarose (NiNTA) was from Qiagen, TEV-protease from Life Technologies, Inc., and factor Xa-protease from Boehringer Mannheim. Radioisotopes were from Amersham Corp. The PtPP2C gene contains 9 TAA triplets coding for Q which were converted to CAA by site-directed mutagenesis (11Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). NdeI and XhoI restriction sites were added by PCR to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, to clone the mutated PtPP2C cDNA into the pET16b expression vector. The cDNA for the bovine PP2Cα isoform with 5′-XhoI and 3′-BamHI restriction sites was from Dr. D. Selke, University of Marburg. Using the PtPP2C as the N-terminal region a PCR fragment was generated which had an MaeI 3′-restriction site at base pairs 578, i.e. at G193 within the third conserved region (12Klumpp S. Hanke C. Donella-Deana A. Beyer A. Kellner R. Pinna L.A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32774-32780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an NdeI cutting site for ligation into pET16b at the 5′-end. The complementary C-terminal fragment of the bovine PP2Cα had an MaeI site 5′ and an XhoI site 3′. The appropriately digested and gel-purified PCR products andNdeI/XhoI cut pET16b were used in a triple ligation to obtain the full-length chimeric PP2C DNA construct in the expression vector. At the N terminus all deletions retained the methionine at position 1 as part of the NdeI restriction site. The N-terminal truncations were PtPP2CΔ2–3, PtPP2CΔ2–11, PtPP2CΔ2–13, PtPP2CΔ2–15, and PtP2CΔ2–19. Truncations at the C terminus were made by cutting off amino acids one by one up to a total of 10. All constructs were generated by PCR using respective oligonucleotide primers and plasmid pET16b/PtPP2C as a template. The PCR products were cloned into the NdeI/XhoI sites of the pET16b expression vector. A TEV protease digestion site (ENLYFQG) was introduced into PtPP2C at positions 219 and 254. Because the DNA sequence encoding the TEV cleavage site can be made to contain an EcoRII restriction site (GAGAATCTTTATTTCCAGGGC) which is absent in the PtPP2C cDNA, placement of the TEV sites could be freely selected. We replaced amino acids 219–226, PtPP2C219TEV, and 254–261, PtPP2C254TEVHisN. To switch the His tag in PtPP2C254TEVHisN to the C terminus creating PtPP2C254TEVHisC, we recloned PtPP2C254TEV into the NcoI site of pET16b in front of the His tag. A Factor Xa cleavage site (IEGRA), whose encoding cDNA contained anAscI restriction site (ATCGAAGGGCGCGCC), was introduced into the PtPP2C by replacement of the amino acids 212–216, PtPP2C212FXa. Single amino acid exchanges at positions 212 to 215 are listed in Table I. The fidelity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequencing.Table IEnzymatic activities of Paramecium protein phosphatase 2C mutantsEnzyme variantSpecific activitymilliunits/mgPtPP2C wild type15.7PtPP2CFXa0PtPP2C Q212I8.3PtPP2C L213E12.3PtPP2C I214G0PtPP2C I214A9.7PtPP2C I214L19.2PtPP2C I215R11.2PtPP2C I215G5.4Bovine PP2Cα2.5Bovine PP2Cα V215G0The data are from a single experimental series, repeated three times with similar results.

Usually, single transformed colonies of E. coli BL21DE3plysS were inoculated into 5 ml of LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and grown over night at 37 °C and 260 rpm. 400 μl were used to inoculate 20 ml of LB medium with antibiotics, grown to anA 600 of 0.4–0.6 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After 3 h, cells were harvested (3,200 × g, 4 °C, 10 min) and resuspended in 800 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm imidazole, 250 mmNaCl, pH 7.9). Bacteria were broken by freeze-thaw and sonication and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min). 100–300 μl of the supernatant were applied to a 25-μl NiNTA column equilibrated with binding buffer. The column was washed with 250 μl of binding buffer and 150 μl of wash buffer (20 mmTris/HCl, 60 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.9). Bound protein was eluted with 150 μl of elution buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 1 m imidazole, 500 mmNaCl, pH 7.9). Protein purity was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad method. The conditions for TEV digestion were as suggested by Life Technologies, Inc. Bovine casein (Sigma C-4765) was phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP by cAMP-dependent protein kinase and purified according to McGowan and Cohen (13McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). PP2C assays (30 μl) contained 20 mm Mg2+ acetate, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μm [32P]casein (about 30,000 cpm). After 10 min at 30 °C dephosphorylation was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid (w/v). After centrifugation radioactivity was determined in the supernatant. Dephosphorylation was restricted to 30% of the total 32P activity to guarantee linearity. One unit of activity is the amount of enzyme which catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 1 μmol of [32P]casein/min (13McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were raised in a rabbit using 200 μg of the recombinant PtPP2C as an immunogen together with Pam3Cys-Ser-(Lys)4x3HCl and Pam3Cys-TH* (250 μg each) as adjuvants (14Jung G.

The antiserum could be used without further purification. Cilia and affinity-purified recombinant proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gels onto nitrocellulose membranes (Optitran, Schleicher & Schuell) by semidry blotting (75 min, 1.1 mA/cm2; blotting buffer 48 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.2, 39 mm glycol, 0.0375% SDS, 20% methanol). The membrane was blocked with TBS (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.9% NaCl) containing 5% non-fat milk powder (M-TBS) and probed with the antiserum diluted 1:5000 in M-TBS. The Amersham ECL detection system was used. Paramecium 7S wild-type cells, grown to early stationary phase in sterile medium (16Kaneshiro E.S. Beischel L.S Merkel S.J. Rhoads D. J. Protozool. 1979; 26: 147-158Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), were harvested and deciliated by a CaCl2 shock (10 min on ice in 5 mmPipes/HCl, pH 7.0, 3 mm KCl, and 40 mmCaCl2). Cell fractionation, protein determination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were carried out as described earlier (17Momayezi M. Wloga D. Kissmehl R. Plattner H. Jung G. Klumpp S. Schultz J.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 891-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence cells were fixed for 10 min at 0 °C in 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with either 0.02% digitonin, 1% saponin, or 0.05% Triton X-100 (with equal results), incubated with anti-PP2C-antiserum (diluted 1:30) and subsequently with goat anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-IgGs. Similarly, pre-embedding electron microscopy immunolabeling studies were carried out with horseradish peroxidase- or 6-nm gold-protein A conjugates (pA-Au6; for details, see Momayezi et al. (17Momayezi M. Wloga D. Kissmehl R. Plattner H. Jung G. Klumpp S. Schultz J.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 891-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar)). For post-embedding labeling cells were fixed for 10 min at 22 °C in 4% formaldehyde + 0.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mcacodylate buffer, pH 7.1. After ethanol dehydration, cells were impregnated with Unicryl® (British BioCell Int., London) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ultrathin sections were prepared, labeled with pA-Au6, stained, and quantitatively evaluated as described elsewhere (18Kissmehl R. Hauser K. Gössringer M. Momayezi M. Klunke N. Plattner H. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We cloned a PP2C gene from aParamecium cDNA library (12Klumpp S. Hanke C. Donella-Deana A. Beyer A. Kellner R. Pinna L.A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32774-32780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its heterologous expression was impossible because in this protozoan the universal stops TAA and TAG code for Q. We now mutated all 9 TAA/Q triplets of the PP2C cDNA to universal CAA/Q triplets and inserted the gene into the expression vector pET16b, thereby attaching a deca His tag and a factor Xa protease site to the N terminus. PtPP2C was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)plysS. Approximately 8 mg of enzymatically active PtPP2C (about 30 milliunits/mg) were purified from a 1-liter culture,i.e. the high A/T content of the Paramecium gene (62%) and the resulting skewed codon usage did not affect the expression in E. coli which has an A/T content of only 50%. A comparison of the enzymatic properties of the native, ciliary and the recombinant PtPP2C showed identical temperature optima (46 °C), yet, the activation energies derived from linear Arrhenius plots were 69 and 30 kJ/mol for the ciliary and the recombinant enzyme, respectively. The most prominent difference was the effect of divalent cations. Substituting 20 mm Mg2+ with 20 mmMn2+ decreased the activity of the native enzyme by 36%, whereas the activity of the recombinant enzyme was almost doubled. Posttranslational modifications of the ciliary enzyme may account for these differences. With only 300 amino acids, the PtPP2C is one of the shortest enzymes of the PPM family. To determine the amino acids essential for catalytic activity we constructed and expressed enzyme proteins which were truncated either at the 5′- or the 3′-end. At the N terminus the following amino acid deletion mutants were generated: PtPP2CΔ2,3, PtPP2CΔ2–11, PtPP2CΔ2–13, PtPP2CΔ2–15, and PtPP2CΔ2–19. All constructs were expressed as soluble proteins with approximately equal efficiency (Fig. 1 A). Removal of up to 10 N-terminal amino acids affected enzymatic activity only slightly. However, deletion of 12 N-terminal amino acids (PtPP2CΔ2–13) diminished activity by 80%. Larger N-terminal truncations yielded soluble expression products, albeit without activity (Fig. 1 A). At the C terminus 4 amino acids (YLRR) were sequentially removed one by one without loss of activity, e.g. the specific activity of PtPP2CΔ297–300 was comparable to the full-length enzyme (Fig. 1 B). The expression of these constructs was about as good as the untruncated PtPP2C. Removal of 5 (VYLRR) or more amino acids (up to 10) from the carboxy end led to drastic changes. First, enzyme activity was lost; second, the yield of purifiable material was diminished,i.e. either the expression rates or the stability of the expressed proteins was reduced. Notably, all C-terminally shortened expression products displayed an anomalous electrophoretic mobility upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, running at an apparent larger molecular mass than the untruncated version (Fig. 1 Band data not shown). Therefore, in addition to the routine verification of all constructs by DNA sequencing we used amino acid analysis and ion-spray mass spectrometry to ascertain the identity of PtPP2CΔ299–300. Data from both methods unequivocally established the correct identity (data not shown). The anomalous electrophoretic mobility of the shortened expression products may be related to the removal of the two terminal basic arginine residues. PP2C isoforms from various phyla share three reasonably long conserved regions within the 200 N-terminal amino acids and only very short stretches of conservation from 200 to 300 (6Bork P. Brown N.P. Hegyi H. Schultz J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 12Klumpp S. Hanke C. Donella-Deana A. Beyer A. Kellner R. Pinna L.A. Schultz J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32774-32780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that the highly diverged C termini may partly be dispensable for catalysis but serve other roles, e.g. in protein folding, targeting to specific cellular locations, or substrate binding. To test this hypothesis we inserted at two different positions a TEV-protease recognition site, which should permit a C-terminal truncation by proteolysis after expression, folding, and purification. Amino acids 219–226 (PtPP2C219TEV, replacement of the weakly conserved sequence DVKKTEL in the β9 strand) and 254–261 (PtPP2C254TEVHisN, replacement of the nonconserved TIGQAQV in the α5 helix) were changed to the TEV cutting sequence ENLYFQG. The constructs were expressed as soluble proteins, purified by NiNTA chromatography, and were recognized by a PtPP2C-specific antibody in Western blots at their calculated molecular masses (data not shown). PtPP2C219TEV was inactive. To reduce the number of exchanged amino acids as well as to replace less conserved amino acids we created PtPP2C212FXa in which the sequence QLII (212–215) was changed to IEGR, thus generating, in conjunction with Ala216, a factor Xa cleavage site (IEGRA). Somewhat surprisingly, PtPP2C212FXa was also inactive (TableI). Individual amino acid exchanges at each of the changed positions showed that exclusively the I214G conversion was responsible for the loss of function (Table I). In an I214A PtPP2C expression product 62% of wild-type activity was retained, and an I214L PtPP2C was at least as active as the wild-type enzyme (Table I). Strikingly, the adjacent isoleucine at position 215 was not crucial for enzyme activity. Neither an I215R nor an I215G conversion abolished PtPP2C activity (Table I). The highly specific knock-out of the enzymatic activity by the replacement of Ile214 with G was unexpected because in the x-ray structure of the human PP2Cα isoform the corresponding region is without a defined secondary structure (9Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to know whether the result with the PtPP2C was due to a structural peculiarity of the protozoan enzyme or was representative of an important, as yet unrecognized structural feature common to all members of this class of phosphatases. Alignment shows that in the bovine PP2Cα isoform a valine at position 215 corresponds to Ile214 of the PtPP2C (see Fig. 3for an extended alignment of PP2C sequences). A bovine PP2Cα construct in pPET16b, which contained a V215G conversion, was expressed in E. coli, yet it was enzymatically inactive, whereas the expressed Val215wild-type enzyme was active (Table I). PtPP2C254TEVHisN carries the TEV site in a linker region connecting the α5 and α6 helices. The expressed protein was active,i.e. the nonconservative exchange of 6 amino acids in this region did not impair protein folding or phosphatase activity (Fig. 2). Upon TEV digestion enzymatic activity was strongly reduced. Yet, due to the incomplete proteolysis and an apparent association of the digested C-terminal peptide with the remaining protein we were unable to fully separate PtPP2CΔ254–300 from the 40-amino acid proteolytic fragment as apparent in Western blots (data not shown). Therefore, we switched the His tag to the C terminus (PtPP2C254TEVHisC). This did not affect phosphatase activity. Now, after TEV digestion we obtained pure PtPP2CΔ254–300 in the flow-through of a NiNTA column which retained all undigested protein and the C-terminal peptide (Fig. 2). PtPP2CΔ254–300 was devoid of phosphatase activity. We conclude that the complete C terminus of the PtPP2C with the exemption of the last 4 amino acids is required for catalytic activity. Taken together the truncation experiments define a PtPP2C of 284 (13–296) as the catalytic core. To prove the functional interchangeability of the C termini we constructed a hybrid PP2C enzyme in which the conservative N terminus (amino acids 1–193) from Parameciumwas linked within the conserved region III (193SRALGD198) to the C-terminal end from the bovine PP2Cα, i.e. 188 amino acids (195–382) of the mammalian enzyme replaced 105 amino acids (194–300) from the PtPP2C. This chimera was expressed as a soluble protein and had a specific activity of 14 milliunits/mg, roughly as the parent PP2C isoforms (35 and 8 milliunits/mg for the Paramecium and bovine PP2C, respectively). This demonstrated that the N and C termini of the bovine and protozoan PP2C are functionally interchangeable despite the low degree of sequence conservation at the amino acid level (22%). Furthermore, it showed that the 80-amino acid extension of the bovine PP2C is irrelevant as far as enzyme activity is considered. All PP2C proteins lack pre- or prosequences and nothing is known about secondary modifications which may serve to target the protein to a particular cytoplasmic compartment. Based on the above data, we must assume that in the PtPP2C only 12 N-terminal and possibly four C-terminal amino acids may be used for subcellular targeting or substrate recognition. It is the more important to determine whether the PtPP2C shows a distinct subcellular localization in the ciliate, which might lead to clues concerning physiological functions of this enzyme. PtPP2C-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays of different cellular fractions showed that 98.6% of the immunoreactivity reside in the deciliated cell bodies, 0.8% in the isolated cilia and 0.6% in the supernatant of the deciliation procedure. Considering that the volume of the cell body is about 98% and of the cilia 2%, one can assume that the PP2C concentration in these compartments is similar. As seen in immunofluorescence analysis of permeabilized cells (Fig. 4 A), cilia contained substantial amounts of PP2C. A more detailed immunocytochemical analysis was carried out by post-embedding pA-Au6 labeling which avoids loss of soluble proteins (Fig. 4 and Table II). Labeling density in the cytoplasm, including the endoplasmic reticulum, exceeded that in any other organelles. Only the nuclei and the cilia were also labeled, whereas other identifiable structures were not significantly labeled (Fig. 4 B). Within the cytoplasm a differentiation between cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum was not possible. Within the cilia, a more detailed structural analysis was made using pre-embedding labeling with pA-Au6. In this method access of the antibody is facilitated by the presence of 0.05% Triton X-100 as a detergent during fixation. This method could be used because biochemical data have shown that in the cilia the PtPP2C is in the particulate fraction and requires 1% Brij 35 as a detergent for solubilization (12Klumpp S.

We observed that 83% of the gold label was associated with axonemal structures, i.e. with the microtubules (42%) and dynein arms (26%) and only 3% with the ciliary membrane (TableIII). In agreement with this it was found that horseradish peroxidase labeling was restricted to the axonemes (Fig. 4 C).Table IIQuantitative evaluation of anti-PP2C-antiserum/pA-Au6 labeling on unicryl sections of nonpermeabilized cells (postembedding labeling), off-cell background correctedSubcellular structureAu grainsn an = individual structures analyzed from a total of 10 cells.ms/μm2Cytoplasm (including endoplasmic reticulum)53.910Macronucleus13.03Cilia9.429Trichocysts0.910Alveolar sacs0.311Fat droplets0.03Mitochondria0.033a n = individual structures analyzed from a total of 10 cells.
