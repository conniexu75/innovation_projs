https://openalex.org/W2004829503,"Mice lacking the known subunit of the type I interferon (IFN) receptor were completely unresponsive to type I IFNs, suggesting that this receptor chain is essential for type I IFN-mediated signal transduction. These mice showed no overt anomalies but were unable to cope with viral infections, despite otherwise normal immune responses. Comparison of mice lacking either type I or type II IFN receptors showed that, at least in response to some viruses, both IFN systems are essential for antiviral defense and are functionally nonredundant."

https://openalex.org/W2067887310,"Formation of a short (less than 2.5 angstroms), very strong, low-barrier hydrogen bond in the transition state, or in an enzyme-intermediate complex, can be an important contribution to enzymic catalysis. Formation of such a bond can supply 10 to 20 kilocalories per mole and thus facilitate difficult reactions such as enolization of carboxylate groups. Because low-barrier hydrogen bonds form only when the pKa's (negative logarithm of the acid constant) of the oxygens or nitrogens sharing the hydrogen are similar, a weak hydrogen bond in the enzyme-substrate complex in which the pKa's do not match can become a strong, low-barrier one if the pKa's become matched in the transition state or enzyme-intermediate complex. Several examples of enzymatic reactions that appear to use this principle are presented."

https://openalex.org/W1970328692,"A pathway by which calcium influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels leads to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation has been characterized. In PC12 cells, membrane depolarization leading to calcium influx through L-type calcium channels activates the dual specificity MAPK kinase MEK1, which phosphorylates and activates MAPK. Calcium influx leads within 30 s to activation of the small guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras. Moreover, activation of MAPK in response to calcium influx is inhibited by the dominant negative mutant RasAsn17, indicating that Ras activity is required for calcium signaling to MAPK. Ras is also activated by release of calcium from intracellular stores and by membrane depolarization of primary cortical neurons. The pleiotropic regulatory potential of both Ras and the MAPK pathway suggests that they may be central mediators of calcium signaling in the nervous system."

https://openalex.org/W2083126580,"A 175-kilodalton erythrocyte binding protein, EBA-175, of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum mediates the invasion of erythrocytes. The erythrocyte receptor for EBA-175 is dependent on sialic acid. The domain of EBA-175 that binds erythrocytes was identified as region II with the use of truncated portions of EBA-175 expressed on COS cells. Region II, which contains a cysteine-rich motif, and native EBA-175 bind specifically to glycophorin A, but not to glycophorin B, on the erythrocyte membrane. Erythrocyte recognition of EBA-175 requires both sialic acid and the peptide backbone of glycophorin A. The identification of both the receptor and ligand domains may suggest rational designs for receptor blockade and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1976275689,"Maternal sources of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are shown here to contribute to the normal appearance and perinatal survival of TGF-beta 1 null newborn mice. Labeled TGF-beta 1 crossed the placenta and was recovered intact from various tissues after oral administration to mouse pups. TGF beta-1 protein was also detected in cells recovered from breast milk. In immunohistochemical analyses, TGF-beta 1 null embryos and null newborn pups born to TGF-beta 1 heterozygotes stained positive for TGF-beta 1, whereas those born to a null female were negative and had severe cardiac abnormalities. These results suggest an important role for maternal sources of TGF-beta 1 during development and, more generally, provide evidence for maternal rescue of targeted gene disruption in the fetus."
https://openalex.org/W2054243030,"In E. coli, replication initiates at a genetically unique origin, oriC. Rapidly growing cells contain multiple oriC copies. Initiation occurs synchronously, once and only once per cell cycle at all origins present. Secondary initiations are prevented by a sequestration process that acts uniquely on newly replicated origins, which are marked because they are hemimethylated at GATC sites. We report the identification of a gene required for sequestration and demonstrate that this gene, seqA, also serves as a negative modulator of the primary initiation process. All previously identified in vivo initiation factors play positive roles. Thus, precise control of replication initiation may involve a balance between positive and negative elements. We suggest that SeqA might be a cooperativity factor, acting to make the replication initiation process dependent upon cooperative interactions among components."

https://openalex.org/W2108576156,"To identify genes involved in mechanotransduction, Drosophila larvae were screened for X-linked mutations affecting a behavioral response to touch. Many mutations that caused nondevelopmental defects were recovered, among them multiple alleles of the genes uncoordinated (unc) and uncoordinated-like (uncl). Adult flies mutant in these genes showed reduced viability that was associated with behavioral phenotypes ranging from reduced locomotor activity to total uncoordination. Behavioral analysis of mosaic flies indicated that external sensory bristles are a focus of the unc mutant defect. Extracellular recordings from mutant mechanosensory bristles revealed that mechanoreceptor potentials were absent or reduced in both unc and uncl mutants. A second genetic screen, for unc-like uncoordination, yielded mutations in seven genes on the second chromosome; mutations in five of these genes also reduced or eliminated bristle mechanoreceptor potentials. These mutants provide the basis for a genetic, electrophysiological, and molecular dissection of mechanotransduction."

https://openalex.org/W1602374960,"The charybdotoxin receptor, purified from bovine tracheal smooth muscle, consists of two subunits (alpha and beta) and, when reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers, forms functional high conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. Amino acid sequence, obtained from proteolytic fragments of the beta-subunit, was used to design oligonucleotide probes with which cDNAs encoding this protein were isolated. The cDNAs encode a protein of 191 amino acids that contains two hydrophobic (putative transmembrane) domains and bears little sequence homology to subunits of other known ion channels. Site-directed antisera, raised against putative extracellular epitopes of this protein, specifically immunoprecipitated 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter beta-subunit as well as [125I]charybdotoxin-cross-linked beta-subunit. Under nondenaturing conditions, however, these anti-beta sera immunoprecipitated a complex consisting of both the alpha- and beta-subunits. The data demonstrate that, in vivo, the high conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ channel exists as a multimer containing both alpha- and beta-subunits, and this cDNA represents the first beta-subunit of a potassium channel cloned to date. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the cloned protein is the subunit to which charybdotoxin is specifically and covalently incorporated when cross-linked to the channel."
https://openalex.org/W2021951044,"The mechanisms underlying interferon (IFN)-induced antiviral states are not well understood. Interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) is an IFN-inducible transcriptional activator, whereas IRF-2 suppresses IRF-1 action. The inhibition of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) replication by IFN-alpha and especially by IFN-gamma was impaired in cells from mice with a null mutation in the IRF-1 gene (IRF-1-/- mice). The IRF-1-/- mice were less resistant than normal mice to EMCV infection, as revealed by accelerated mortality and a larger virus titer in target organs. The absence of IRF-1 did not clearly affect replication of two other types of viruses. Thus, IRF-1 is necessary for the antiviral action of IFNs against some viruses, but IFNs activate multiple activation pathways through diverse target genes to induce the antiviral state."

https://openalex.org/W2040631469,"Many high threshold, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, including the dihydropyridine-sensitive class (L-type), inactivate in response not only to voltage, but also to entry of Ca2+. Despite the physiological importance of this Ca(2+)-sensitive inactivation, its molecular mechanism is understood only in broad outline. We now demonstrate that Ca(2+)-dependent inactivation transpires by a Ca(2+)-induced shift of channel gating to a low open probability mode, distinguished by a more than 100-fold reduction of entry rate to the open state. A gating mechanism that explains this shift quantitatively and enables successful separation of Ca(2+)- and voltage-sensitive forms of inactivation is deduced and tested. Finally, both calmodulin activation and channel (de)phosphorylation are excluded as significant signaling events underlying Ca(2+)-induced mode shifts, leaving direct binding of Ca2+ to the channel as a likely chemical initiation event for inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2048159226,"During positive selection, developing thymocytes are rescued from programmed cell death by T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated recognition of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. MHC-bound peptides contribute to this process. Recently we identified individual MHC-binding peptides which can induce positive selection of a single TCR. Here we examine peptide fine specificity in positive selection. These data suggest that a direct TCR-peptide interaction occurs during this event, and strengthens the correlation between selecting peptides and TCR antagonists. Certain positively selecting peptides are weakly antigenic. We demonstrate that thymocytes 'educated' on such a peptide are specifically non-responsive to it and have decreased CD8 expression levels. Similar reduction of CD8 expression on mature T cells converts a TCR agonist into a TCR antagonist. These data indicate that thymocytes may maintain self-tolerance towards a positively selecting ligand by regulating co-receptor expression."
https://openalex.org/W1588736007,"Previous studies have shown that pulmonary surfactant protein D (SP-D) is composed of a 43-kDa polypeptide with a short NH2-terminal domain, a collagen sequence, and a COOH-terminal C-type lectin domain. In the present studies, ultrastructural and biochemical techniques were used to examine the quaternary structure of native rat SP-D (rSP-D). Electron microscopy of freeze-dried preparations demonstrated a highly homogeneous population of molecules with four identical rod-like arms (46 nm in length), each with an 8-9-nm diameter globular terminal expansion. The arms, which are similar in diameter to the type I collagen helix (approximately 4 nm), emanate from the central hub in two pairs that closely parallel each other for their first 10 nm. This structure is consistent with hydrodynamic studies that predict an highly asymmetric and extended molecule (f/f0 = 3.26) with a large Stokes radius (Rs = 18 nm). Pepsin digestion gave glycosylated, trimeric collagenous fragments (43 +/- 4 nm, 17 kDa/chain). Trimeric subunits containing intact triple helical domains were also liberated from SP-D dodecamers by sulfhydryl reduction under non-denaturing conditions. Digestion of rSP-D with bacterial collagenase generated a COOH-terminal carbohydrate binding fragment and a smaller peptide (approximately 12 kDa, unreduced) that contains interchain disulfide bonds. Electron microscopy also demonstrated higher orders of multimerization, with as many as 8 molecules associated at the hub. These studies demonstrate that SP-D is assembled as homopolymers of four identical trimeric subunits, that interactions between the amino-terminal domains of the trimers are stabilized by interchain disulfide bonds, and that SP-D molecules can associate to form complex multimolecular assemblies."

https://openalex.org/W1588444780,"Expression of the O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene in human glioma cell lines is strongly associated with resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. To examine the possibility that methylation of the body and promoter regions of the MGMT gene is associated with MGMT expression in a graded, rather than a completely on/off fashion, the present study analyzed the methylation status of the MGMT gene in human glioma cell lines exhibiting a wide range of MGMT expression. Methylation in the body of the gene was uniform within each cell line and correlated directly with MGMT expression. The level of MGMT promoter methylation was also graded across the cell lines, at 21 of 25 CpGs tested, but correlated inversely with MGMT expression. Two sites in the MGMT promoter were also much more accessible to restriction enzyme digestion, and thus in a more open chromatin conformation, in nuclei from high MGMT expressors relative to nuclei from cells with little or no MGMT expression. We conclude that the level of methylation, in both the body and promoter of the MGMT gene, is associated with MGMT expression in a graded fashion and may be important in setting the transcriptional state of the MGMT promoter through changes in chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2078427502,"The basic notions of transition state theory have been exploited in the past to generate highly selective catalysts from the vast library of antibody molecules in the immune system. These same ideas were used to isolate an RNA molecule, from a large library of RNAs, that catalyzes the isomerization of a bridged biphenyl. The RNA-catalyzed reaction displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a catalytic rate constant (kcat) of 2.8 x 10(-5) per minute and a Michaelis constant (Km) of 542 microM; the reaction is competitively inhibited by the planar transition state analog with an inhibition constant (Ki) value of approximately 7 microM. This approach may provide a general strategy for expanding the scope of RNA catalysis beyond those reactions in which the substrates are nucleic acids or nucleic acid derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W2053659274,"Photoreceptors of dissociated Drosophila retinae were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicators, fluo-3 and Calcium Green-5N. In fluo-3-loaded, wild-type photoreceptors, a rapid increase in fluorescence (Ca2+ signal) accompanied the light-evoked inward current. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ greatly reduced the Ca2+ signal, indicating Ca2+ influx as its major cause. In Calcium Green-5N-loaded trp mutants, which lack a large fraction of the Ca2+ permeability underlying the light-evoked inward current, the Ca2+ signal was smaller relative to wild-type photoreceptors. Fluo-3-loaded norpA mutant photoreceptors, which lack a light-activated phospholipase C, generated no light-evoked inward current and no Ca2+ signal. The phosphoinositide pathway therefore appears necessary for both excitation and changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2068947207,"The structure of the leech protein decorsin, a potent 39-residue antagonist of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance. In contrast to other disintegrins, the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-containing region of decorsin is well defined. The three-dimensional structure of decorsin is similar to that of hirudin, an anticoagulant leech protein that potently inhibits thrombin. Amino acid sequence comparisons suggest that ornatin, another glycoprotein IIb-IIIa antagonist, and antistasin, a potent Factor Xa inhibitor and anticoagulant found in leeches, share the same structural motif. Although decorsin, hirudin, and antistasin all affect the blood clotting process and appear similar in structure, their mechanisms of action and epitopes important for binding to their respective targets are distinct."
https://openalex.org/W2072952476,"Fragile sites are chemically induced nonstaining gaps in chromosomes. Different fragile sites vary in frequency in the population and in the chemistry of their induction. DNA sequences encompassing and including the rare, autosomal, folate-sensitive fragile site, FRA16A, were isolated by positional cloning. The molecular basis of FRA16A was found to be expansion of a normally polymorphic p(CCG)n repeat. This repeat was adjacent to a CpG island that was methylated in fragile site-expressing individuals. The FRA16A locus in individuals who do not express the fragile site is not a site of DNA methylation (imprinting), which suggests that the methylation associated with fragile sites may be a consequence and not a cause of their genesis."
https://openalex.org/W1492572803,"Secretion of catecholamines from individual bovine adrenal medullary cells in culture was examined by amperometry with 1-micron radius carbon-fiber electrodes. Vesicular secretion is observed as a series of current spikes upon exposure to a secretagogue. The small size of the electrodes was exploited to map exocytotic release sites on the surface of bovine adrenal medullary cells. These studies reveal for the first time that release sites are spatially localized on endocrine cells in culture for a time scale of at least 15 min. Fluorescent monitoring by confocal microscopy of deposition of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase from the vesicular membrane into the plasma membrane during exocytosis confirms the existence of zones of exocytotic inactivity on the surface of the cell. Measurement of coincident spikes with two adjacent electrodes (2.5-microns radius) has allowed the spatial resolution for measurement of exocytosis to be defined as 2 microns from the projected circumference of the electrode on the surface of the cell. In this small domain, point-source release and diffusional broadening would result in narrow spikes (Schroeder, T. J., Jankowski, J. A., Kawagoe, K. T., Wightman, R. M., Lefrou, C., and Amatore, C. (1992) Anal. Chem. 64, 3077-3083), a feature not seen in the data. Thus, for adrenal medullary cells, release following vesicular fusion is not instantaneous, but is a prolonged event occurring over several milliseconds."
https://openalex.org/W1512900768,"PECAM-1 (CD31) is a 130-kDa glycoprotein found on platelets, endothelial cells, granulocytes, and monocytes, as well as on certain myelomonocytic cell lines. Recent studies have shown that PECAM-1 may be involved in activation of leukocyte integrins and may also be involved in adhesive interactions of circulating leukocytes and the vessel wall. In spite of the important functional role that PECAM-1 plays in these processes, little is known about the biosynthesis, processing, and turnover of PECAM-1 on the cell surface. We have studied the biosynthesis of PECAM-1 in the promonocytic cell line U937, and in endothelial cells, by pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation. PECAM-1 was synthesized as a 110-kDa precursor form, which was processed into the 130-kDa mature form within 1-3 h, during which time it began to move to the cell surface. The protein disappeared from the cell surface in both cell types about 48 h after labeling. A soluble form of PECAM-1, which is 5-10 kDa smaller than cell-associated PECAM-1 and contains the cytoplasmic tail, was observed in the culture media of HUVECs and phorbol ester-treated U937 cells. This form of soluble PECAM-1 is encoded by an alternatively spliced mRNA from which the exon containing the transmembrane domain has been removed. Soluble PECAM-1 was also detected in normal human plasma at levels of 10-25 ng/ml. Two isoforms of plasma PECAM-1, which differed in the presence of the cytoplasmic tail, were observed by Western blot analysis. In parallel with soluble forms of other cell adhesion molecules, soluble PECAM-1 may play a role in modulating the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W1539413326,"Coagulation factors V and VIII are homologous glycosylated plasma proteins that provide essential functions for hemostasis. Factor V is secreted as a single chain polypeptide, whereas factor VIII is processed intracellularly to yield a metal-ion-associated heterodimer that is stabilized through interaction with von Willebrand factor. In transfected mammalian cells, factor V is more efficiently secreted than factor VIII. To provide insight into the different secretion efficiencies, we compared the post-translational processing requirements for factor V and factor VIII expressed in mammalian cells. In contrast to factor VIII, factor V was not detected in association with the immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), a chaperonin protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Depletion of intracellular ATP levels by treatment of cells with low concentrations of carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), protonophore that uncouples oxidative phosphorylation, inhibited secretion of factor VIII but had no effect on the secretion of factor V. Inhibition of N-linked oligosaccharide addition by treatment with tunicamycin prevented secretion of both factor V and factor VIII, whereas treatment with an inhibitor of complex oligosaccharide addition, deoxymannojirimycin, did not affect secretion, although the specific activities of both factor V and factor VIII were slightly increased. Thus, complex oligosaccharide addition was not required for secretion or functional activity of either factor V or factor VIII. Depletion of intralumenal calcium with the ionophore A23187 did not affect secretion of either factor V or factor VIII. In the presence of A23187, the secreted factor V was fully functional, whereas the factor VIII heavy and light chains were not associated and the secreted molecule was inactive. In addition, A23187 treatment inhibited addition of serine/threonine (O)-linked oligosaccharides to factor V and factor VIII. The differences between factor V and factor VIII were further evaluated by characterization of a single chain mutant factor VIII. The single chain factor VIII was secreted with an efficiency similar to wild-type factor VIII and also required von Willebrand factor for stabilization. In addition, the activity of single chain factor VIII was also inhibited by A23187 treatment, suggesting a unique metal-ion requirement within the secretory pathway for functional factor VIII folding. The differences identified in BiP association, ATP requirements, and metal-ion dependence for effective functional secretion of these two molecules may underlie mechanisms accounting for their different secretion efficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W2070913297,"Triphalangeal thumb is a developmental anomaly, sometimes dominantly transmitted, characterized by a long, finger-like thumb with three phalanges instead of two. The underlying genetic defect is unknown, but presumably involves genes that regulate the differentiation of the developing forelimb. In two large kindreds with triphalangeal thumb, evidence for linkage to the long arm of chromosome 7 was obtained with a maximum lod score of 12.61. Multipoint linkage and haplotype analysis placed the gene close to the telomere of the long arm. To our knowledge this is the first time that a human gene involved solely in the pathologic morphogenesis of the hand and feet has been localized."

https://openalex.org/W1557616402,"The human and mouse cripto-1 (CR-1) genes can code for proteins related in structure to epidermal growth factor (EGF). A specific 36-kDa immunoreactive protein was detected by Western blot analysis in human cell lines that express CR-1 mRNA but not in cell lines that fail to express this transcript. Immunoprecipitation of GEO colon carcinoma or mouse embryonal carcinoma cells detected 27-29-kDa and 24-kDa proteins, respectively. Cell lysates and conditioned medium that were prepared from several CHO clones and were expressing either a recombinant human or mouse CR-1 cDNA contained immunospecific 27-29-kDa and 24-kDa proteins, respectively. Monensin or tunicamycin treatment resulted in a shift of the 27-29-kDa human CR-1 protein to 24 kDa and 20 kDa, respectively. The 20-kDa protein was also observed after digestion of the 27-29-kDa human CR-1 protein with N-glycosidase F. Using two CR-1 synthetic refolded peptides that correspond to the EGF-like domain of the human CR-1 sequence or conditioned medium obtained from human CR-1 expressing CHO cells, growth stimulatory activity could be detected on non-transformed human mammary epithelial cells and on two human breast cancer cell lines. EGF receptor-blocking antibody did not inhibit the growth stimulatory action of the CR-1 protein. Likewise, the CR-1 refolded peptides or conditioned medium from the human CR-1-expressing CHO cells failed to inhibit the binding of 125I-EGF in an EGF-radioreceptor assay. These data demonstrate that the CR-1 is a glycoprotein that can function as a growth factor through an EGF receptor-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2106933249,"Both the 5' cap (m7GpppN) and the 3' poly(A) tail of eukaryotic mRNAs are important regulators of translation efficiency in vivo. Their function, however, is markedly reduced in in vitro translation systems derived from either rabbit reticulocytes or wheat germ. The impact of exogenous poly(A) on cap-dependent translation was examined in vitro. The translation of uncapped mRNA was preferentially repressed in the presence of exogenous poly(A). As a result, translation became increasingly cap-dependent with the increase in exogenous poly(A). The translation in wheat germ lysate was stimulated by the addition of purified eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4B or eIF-4F; however, addition of poly(A) prevented this eIF-4B- or eIF-4F-mediated stimulation. Addition of eIF-4F or eIF-4B, alone, was not sufficient to restore translation in lysate to which poly(A) had been added. Restoration, however, was observed when eIF-4F, eIF-4B, and eIF-4A were added in combination. These data suggest that 1) exogenous poly(A) may bind to and sequester factors required for translation and 2) that capped messages compete with poly(A) more efficiently for these factors than do uncapped mRNAs. Gel shift analysis of purified initiation factors isolated from wheat germ confirmed that eIF-4B and eIF-4F do in fact form complexes with poly(A) in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1553594457,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) receptor levels and chondrocyte maturation during endochondral ossification. Chondrocytes were isolated from the growth plate of rabbit ribs and maintained in the presence of 10% serum in mass cultures. Treatment with PTH-(1-84) and a PTH-(1-34) fragment suppressed the increases in alkaline phosphatase activity and in type X collagen and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor levels and abolished 45Ca incorporation into mineral, all of which occurred in parallel untreated cultures in the hypertrophic (terminal) stage. These effects of PTH were observed at low concentrations (10(-10) to 10(-9) M) and within 24-48 h of treatment. PTH-(1-84) and PTH-(1-34) also increased [35S]sulfate incorporation into newly synthesized proteoglycans. In contrast, the middle and carboxyl-terminal fragments of PTH tested had little effect on proteoglycan synthesis or terminal differentiation. The binding of 125I-PTH-(1-34) to cells in the growth plate was greater than that to cells in liver, skin, muscle, brain, or kidney. When the correlation between binding levels and stage of maturation was examined, we found that 125I-PTH-(1-34) binding to its 72-kDa receptor was low in resting and proliferating chondrocytes, increased 10-fold in matrix-forming chondrocytes, and thereafter decreased in hypertrophic chondrocytes both in vitro and in situ. Scatchard analysis revealed that the changes in PTH binding were due to changes in the number, and not in the affinity, of the receptor. The changes in PTH-(1-34) binding paralleled those in [35S]sulfate incorporation into proteoglycans. These findings suggest that stage-dependent increases in PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor levels localize the hormone stimulation of proteoglycan synthesis and inhibition of precocious hypertrophy in the matrix-forming zone of growth plates."
https://openalex.org/W2222372567,"When stimulated, neutrophils undergo a respiratory burst converting oxygen to superoxide. Although superoxide is critical for microbial killing by phagocytic cells, the precise role it plays has yet to be established. It has been proposed to optimize their production of hypochlorous acid and to be required for the generation of hydroxyl radicals. Superoxide is also involved in the hydroxylation of salicylate by neutrophils. However, the mechanism of this reaction is unknown. We found that neutrophils stimulated with opsonized zymosan hydroxylated salicylate to produce mainly 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate. Its formation was dependent on superoxide and a heme protein but was independent of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals. Production of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate was enhanced by methionine, which scavenges hypochlorous acid. Neutrophils from an individual with myeloperoxidase deficiency hydroxylated salicylate at only 13% of the level of control cells. Purified human myeloperoxidase and xanthine oxidase plus hypoxanthine hydroxylated salicylate to produce 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate. As with neutrophils, the reaction required superoxide but not hydrogen peroxide and was unaffected by hydroxyl radical scavengers. Thus, myeloperoxidase catalyzes superoxide-dependent hydroxylation. This newly recognized reaction may be relevant to the in vivo functions of superoxide and myeloperoxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1513560629,"Stimulation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity is achieved in vivo by diacylglycerol but can also be obtained with tumor-promoting phorbol esters. Evidence is presented indicating that these two classes of activator may interact at different regions of the enzyme. The activity of a calcium-dependent PKC isoform (PKC-I) preparation was determined using 1,2-dioleoylglycerol (DOG) together with the phorbol ester 4 beta-12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The resulting PKC activity was in excess of that attained with either activator alone, each being at a maximum concentration for activation. A similar result was obtained with purified PKC-alpha and -epsilon isoforms, indicating that the additive effect was not due to sites being on distinct enzyme molecules. Support for two dissimilar activator sites came from the observation that the inactive phorbol ester 4 alpha-TPA competed for TPA but not for DOG in PKC activation. Other differences were observed between TPA- and DOG-activated PKC. It was found that 1-butanol inhibited DOG-activated PKC-I, while being without effect on stimulation by TPA. Also, the inclusion of phosphatidylethanolamine in the lipid vesicles led to a potentiation of PKC-I activity which was greater when activation was achieved by DOG compared to TPA. Further, the calcium- and DOG-dependent active conformational change of PKC was fully reversible upon calcium chelation, while that stimulated by TPA was only partially reversible. These experiments taken together suggest that diacylglycerols and phorbol esters bind with different affinities and at different sites on PKC, and induce distinct activated conformational forms of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1479824186,"The myogenin gene, a member of the gene family encoding muscle-specific basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors, is activated in myoblasts at the onset of differentiation and can be induced in fibroblasts by forced expression of MyoD or its relatives. Here, we report that a small proximal promoter region of the Myf-4 gene, the human myogenin homolog, suffices to direct muscle-specific expression and up-regulation by MyoD. The minimal promoter contains an E-box and a MEF-2 consensus element. Paradoxically, we find that the MEF-2 binding site but not the E-box is necessary for cell type-specific expression and activation by MyoD in tissue culture cells. This suggests an activating mechanism which is independent of direct protein interactions at the E-box. MEF-2 binding complexes were detected in myoblasts and myotubes, as well as in fibroblasts with no strict correlation to myogenin expression. Moreover, transcription of myogenin could be induced in the presence of potent inhibitors of protein synthesis. From these results we conclude that myogenin expression is not mediated primarily through de novo synthesis of MEF-2 but rather involves a post-translational mode of activation."
https://openalex.org/W1599349952,"The predominant functions of secreted IgM, complement fixation and transcytosis across epithelial barriers via the poly(Ig) receptor, are properties of IgM polymers; thus, the mechanisms that regulate oligomerization are critical to immune function. We have developed methods to assess the mechanism and subcellular location of IgM polymer formation. Using denaturing agarose/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sucrose gradient fractionation, we demonstrate that IgM polymers are assembled in a stepwise fashion in which primary intermediates, including heavy chain-light chain complexes, are sequentially incorporated. Assembly intermediates include both covalent and non-covalent components, suggesting that IgM subunit interactions precede covalent assembly. IgM polymers are assembled from primary intermediates containing immature N-linked oligosaccharides. Polymerization is insensitive to brefeldin A and occurs at temperatures that inhibit protein transport along the secretory pathway. Together, these data demonstrate that IgM polymerization occurs early in the secretory pathway, most likely in the endoplasmic reticulum. These results are consistent with a model in which secretory IgM represents an oligomeric protein that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and does not mature along the secretory pathway until complete assembly is achieved."

https://openalex.org/W1541312802,"The cDNA encoding the 116-kDa polypeptide of the bovine brain vacuolar-type proton translocating ATPases has been cloned and sequenced. One of five clones differed from all others in that it contained an 18-base pair deletion within the coding region, whereas it was identical to the other clones in overlapping coding and noncoding regions, indicating that this heterogeneity arises through an alternative splicing mechanism. By conventional Northern analysis, only one 4.1-kilobase mRNA was identified in bovine brain, heart, kidney, liver, and spleen. However, a polymerase chain reaction-based analysis revealed two species of mRNA with a tissue-specific distribution. Type I, containing the 18-base pair insert, was found in brain, whereas the truncated (Type II) form was found in all tissues examined. Similar tissue distributions of rat mRNA were observed. The deletion site accounting for this variability occurs within a predicted protease sensitivity motif (PEST site), suggesting that differences in the biological half-life of the two 116-kDa isoforms may exist."
https://openalex.org/W1536034321,"We have studied the kinetics of muscarinic receptor trafficking between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments in NG108-15 cells. A model of trafficking is proposed that includes four transport steps, delivery to the plasma membrane from the Golgi complex (linear) and endosomes (exponential) internalization from the plasma membrane into endosomes (exponential), and a degradative route from endosomes into lysosomes (linear). Based upon this model, a general equation has been derived that describes changes in receptor number at the plasma membrane and in endosomes in response to agonist stimulation. By following the movement of receptors into and out of the plasma membrane under various experimental conditions, it has been possible to determine the values of the four rate constants in the general equation and also the size of the endosomal receptor pool created by agonist stimulation. The consequences of changes in these constants for receptor trafficking are demonstrated. The model accounts for the effect of varying the duration of agonist stimulation on the size of the endosomal receptor pool and also permits an estimation of the receptor trafficking that underlies the well-established phenomenon of agonist-induced receptor internalization."
https://openalex.org/W1589511079,"Abstract Recent studies have shown that serine protease inhibitors can be regulated in their activity, specificity, and location by glycoprotein or extracellular matrix (ECM) co-factors. Protease nexin-1 (PN-1) is a member of the serpin superfamily of serine protease inhibitors which can rapidly inhibit thrombin, urokinase, and plasmin. PN-1 binds tightly to and is regulated by the ECM. This interaction accelerates the inhibition of thrombin by PN-1 and blocks urokinase and plasmin inhibition by PN-1. Previous work showed that heparan sulfate proteoglycan is largely responsible for the acceleration of thrombin inhibition by PN-1. Our current studies were directed at identifying ECM component(s) that decreased the ability of PN-1 to inhibit urokinase and plasmin. These studies showed that collagen type IV decreased the formation of SDS-stable complexes between urokinase or plasmin and PN-1 without affecting formation of complexes between thrombin and PN-1. The second order rate constant for inhibition of urokinase by PN-1 was markedly decreased with increasing collagen type IV, whereas the second order rate constant for inhibition of thrombin by PN-1 was unaffected by addition of collagen type IV. Other ECM components (collagen type I, vitronectin, fibronectin, and heat-denatured collagen type IV) did not affect complex formation or the rate of inhibition of proteases by PN-1, indicating that these effects were specific to collagen type IV. Binding of PN-1 to immobilized collagen type IV was demonstrated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the concentration of PN-1 necessary to obtain 50% saturation of the immobilized collagen type IV binding sites was approximately 15 nM. Collagen type IV was also copurified with PN-1 from fibroblast-conditioned medium. These results demonstrate a novel regulation of serpin specificity in which an ECM co-factor decreased the inhibition of certain proteases by the serpin without affecting the inhibition of its target protease."
https://openalex.org/W140120344,"Fibronectin is a dimeric adhesion molecule that consists of three types of repeating modules. Adherent cells bind soluble fibronectin and incorporate it into insoluble fibrils in the extracellular matrix. The amino-terminal 70-kDa portion of fibronectin mediates binding to the cell surface, but amino-terminal fragments do not accumulate in the extracellular matrix. The ninth type I and first type III modules, the cell adhesion region, and the cysteines that form the interchain disulfide bonds have also been implicated in matrix assembly. To further define which regions of fibronectin are essential for matrix assembly, we generated a dimeric protein (d70 kDa) in which the 70-kDa amino terminus is directly linked to the last 51 amino acids of fibronectin, which contain the cysteines involved in interchain disulfide bonding. d70 kDa bound to cells and accumulated in the extracellular matrix. Incorporation of d70 kDa into the extracellular matrix was dependent upon protein synthesis; in cycloheximide-treated cultures that lacked a pre-existing matrix, d70 kDa accumulated in the extracellular matrix only in the presence of intact fibronectin. Monomeric 70-kDa protein was not incorporated into the matrix in the presence or absence of cycloheximide. These data indicate that fibronectin molecules containing only the amino-terminal 70-kDa region and the carboxyl-terminal 51 amino acids can become assembled into the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2102896921,"The Goodpasture antigen is the target of anti-basement membrane autoantibodies in Goodpasture's disease, a severe human autoimmune disease characterized by glomerulonephritis and lung hemorrhage. It has been identified as the NC1 domain of the alpha 3 chain of type IV collagen (alpha 3(IV)NC1), a minority component of glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Protocols for obtaining pure human antigen are laborious and low yielding and require cadaver kidneys. Recombinant alpha 3(IV)NC1 produced in Escherichia coli has been insoluble and poorly recognized by patients' autoantibodies. We have used the baculovirus expression system to produce the antigen as a soluble product in Sf9 cells. A transfer vector was constructed from cDNAs encoding the leader peptide, NH2 terminus, and 7 S domain of the human alpha 1 chain of type IV collagen and was joined inframe to the NC1 domain and COOH terminus of the human alpha 3 chain under the control of the polyhedrin promoter. It therefore encodes a hybrid mini-collagen chain from which the majority of the central triple helical region has been deleted. The recombinant antigen was seen on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blots of supernatants at its predicted molecular size of 41 kDa and as dimers of 82 kDa. It reacted strongly with human autoantibodies by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, inhibited binding of autoantibodies to human GBM, and bound two monoclonal antibodies known to recognize human alpha 3(IV)NC1. A common alternatively spliced variant alpha 3(IV)NC1 mRNA, leading to a truncated NC1 domain of 60 amino acids, was expressed as a fusion protein with the same alpha 1 NH2-terminal sequence. It failed to be exported from the cell and was not recognized by autoantibodies. Other NC1 domains could be expressed in the same way. These recombinant molecules should prove invaluable for the in vitro study of the immunopathogenesis of Goodpasture's disease, and the approach provides a means by which interactions between the different type IV collagen chains found in GBM could be studied in vitro."
