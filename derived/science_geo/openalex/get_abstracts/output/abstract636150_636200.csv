https://openalex.org/W2957696726,"Megacities are facing serious water pollution problems due to urbanization, rapid population growth and economic development. Water is an essential resource for human activities and socio-economic development and water quality in urban settings has important implications for human and environmental health. Urbanization and lack of sewerage has left the water in Jakarta, Indonesia in a heavily polluted condition. Rigorous assessment of urban water quality is necessary to understand the factors controlling water quality conditions. We use trend analysis to assess the current water quality conditions in Jakarta, focusing on Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Dissolved Oxygen (DO), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS). In most monitoring stations analyzed, BOD and TSS concentrations have decreased over time, but from large starting concentrations. DO in most monitoring stations has increased. Although Jakarta’s water quality has shown some improvement, it remains heavily impaired. The average value of BOD is low in upper stream stations compared to middle and lower stream stations. BOD and TSS trends of some water quality stations in middle and lower streams show increasing trends. Cluster analysis results suggest three groups for BOD and TSS, and four groups for DO. Understanding water quality conditions and factors that control water quality suggest strategies for improving water quality given current trends in climate, population growth and urban development. Results from this study suggest research directions and management strategies to address water quality challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2962360208,"Acute abdominal pain (colic) is the most common reason for emergency veterinary treatment in the horse. Consolidation of data through a systematic review is important to inform evidence-based medicine and clinical guidelines, but there are currently no published systematic reviews on colic in the horse. The aim of this study was to identify, categorize and appraise the evidence on factors associated with increased risk of developing abdominal pain (colic) due to gastrointestinal disease in the adult horse. A scoping review was performed to identify and categorize evidence on all risk factors for colic. A systematic review of management-related risk factors was then performed following PRISMA guidelines. Both searches were conducted in Medline, CAB Abstracts and Web of Science databases, and publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. For the scoping review, study and participant characteristics of included publications and key results were extracted and tabulated. For the systematic review, cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies investigating acute abdominal pain in horses within two weeks of management changes were assessed. Study characteristics, participant characteristics and study results of included publications for the systematic review were extracted and tabulated. Included publications were appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools for cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies. The scoping review search identified 3,756 publications. Fifty eight studies met final inclusion criteria, and 22 categories of risk factors were identified. These were grouped into three broad areas: horse-related factors, management-related factors and environment-related factors. The largest body of evidence related to management change. The systematic review of management change identified 410 publications: 14 met inclusion criteria for analysis. These consisted of one cohort, eight case-control and five cross-sectional studies. The studies were conducted between 1990–2008, and the majority of studies were located in the USA (8/14) or UK (3/14). The risk factors related to management change that were assessed were feed, carer, exercise, pasture, water and housing. The largest bodies of evidence for increased risk of colic associated with management change were changes in feed (5/14 publications) and recent change in housing (3/14). Most studies (8/14) did not meet the JBI criterion on confounding factors. There was marked heterogeneity of study methodologies and measures. This is the first study to use a combined scoping and systematic review to analyse evidence for modifiable risk factors for a common condition in the horse. It provides a comprehensive review that will be a key resource for researchers, veterinary practitioners and horse owners. It identified modifiable risk factors associated with an increased risk of colic which should be a key target for preventative health programmes. The findings from the critical appraisal were used to develop recommendations for future research to improve the quality of evidence-based veterinary medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2960479439,"Background Depression, one of the most costly and common mental disorders, is reported to be associated with lower quality of life (QoL) in several studies. Improved understanding of the associated factors with QoL is necessary to optimize long-term outcomes and reduce disability in patients with depression. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify factors that are associated with lower QoL among patients with depression. Methods The study was based on the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional health examination, years 2008 to 2014. The final analyzed sample consisted of a total of 1,502 study subjects who had been diagnosed by clinicians as having depression. A multivariate logistic regression model was performed to exam the association between the clinical characteristics (age, sex, demographic and health-related characteristics) and QoL. Analysis of covariance was also used to analyze EQ-5D according to mental health. Results Older age, lower level of education, lower income, worse subjective perception of health, unemployment, obesity and mental health struggles were found to be significantly associated with low QoL in depressive individuals after adjustment for multiple covariates. Conclusions This study has outlined grounding data in identifying patients who are at risk of QoL impairment. Policy makers should direct their interests to these individuals and provide appropriate management."
https://openalex.org/W2961164679,"We aimed to investigate metabolites associated with the 28-joint disease activity score based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using capillary electrophoresis quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Plasma and urine samples were collected from 32 patients with active RA (DAS28-ESR≥3.2) and 17 with inactive RA (DAS28-ESR<3.2). We found 15 metabolites in plasma and 20 metabolites in urine which showed a significant but weak positive or negative correlation with DAS28-ESR. When metabolites between active and inactive patients were compared, 9 metabolites in plasma and 15 in urine were found to be significantly different. Consequently, we selected 11 metabolites in plasma and urine as biomarker candidates which significantly correlated positively or negatively with DAS28-ESR, and significantly differed between active and inactive patients. When a multiple logistic regression model was built to discriminate active and inactive cohorts, three variables—histidine and guanidoacetic acid from plasma and hypotaurine from urine—generated a high area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve value (AUC = 0.8934). Thus, this metabolomics approach appeared to be useful for investigating biomarkers of RA. Combination of plasma and urine analysis may lead to more precise and reliable understanding of the disease condition. We also considered the pathophysiological significance of the found biomarker candidates."
https://openalex.org/W2960608730,"Background Lifestyle factors predicting successful aging as a unified concept or as separate components of successful aging are important for understanding healthy aging, interventions and preventions. The main objective was to investigate the effect of midlife predictors on subsequent successful aging 20 years later. Materials and methods Data were from a population-based health survey, the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), with an average follow-up of 22.6 years. Individuals free of major disease at baseline in 1984–86 with complete datasets for the successful aging components in HUNT3 in 2006–08, were included (n = 4497; mean age at baseline 52.7, range 45–59, years). Successful aging was defined either as a unified category or as three components: being free of nine specified diseases and depression, having no physical or cognitive impairment, and being actively engaged with life. The midlife predictors (smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption, obesity and social support) were analysed both as separate predictors and combined into a lifestyle index controlling for sociodemographic variables, using multivariable regression analysis. Results Successful aging as a unified concept was related to all the lifestyle factors in the unadjusted analyses, and all except alcohol consumption in the adjusted analyses. The individual components of successful aging were differently associated with the lifestyle factors; engagement with life was less associated with the lifestyle factors. Non- smoking and good social support were the most powerful predictors for successful aging as a unified concept. When the lifestyle factors were summed into a lifestyle index, there was a trend for more positive lifestyle to be related to higher odds for successful aging. Conclusions Lifestyle factors predicted an overall measure of SA, as well as the individual components, more than 20 years later. Modifiable risk factors in midlife, exemplified by social support, may be used for interventions to promote overall health and specific aspects of health in aging."
https://openalex.org/W2961100055,"Therapeutic footwear becomes the first treatment line in the prevention of diabetic foot ulcer and future complications of diabetes. Previous studies and the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot have described therapeutic footwear as a protective factor to reduce the risk of re-ulceration. In this study, we aimed to analyze the efficacy of a rigid rocker sole to reduce the recurrence rate of plantar ulcers in patients with diabetic foot.Between June 2016 and December 2017, we conducted a randomized controlled trial in a specialized diabetic foot unit.Fifty-one patients with diabetic neuropathy who had a recently healed plantar ulcer were randomized consecutively into the following two groups: therapeutic footwear with semi-rigid sole (control) or therapeutic footwear with a rigid rocker sole (experimental). All patients included in the study were followed up for 6 months (one visit each 30 ± 2 days) or until the development of a recurrence event.Primary outcome measure was recurrence of ulcers in the plantar aspect of the foot.A total of 51 patients were randomized to the control and experimental groups. The median follow-up time was 26 [IQR-4.4-26.1] weeks for both groups. On an intention-to-treat basis, 16 (64%) and 6 (23%) patients in the control and experimental groups had ulcer recurrence, respectively. Among the group with >60% adherence to therapeutic footwear, multivariate analysis showed that the rigid rocker sole improved ulcer recurrence-free survival time in diabetes patients with polyneuropathy and DFU history (P = 0.019; 95% confidence interval, 0.086-0.807; hazard ratio, 0.263).We recommend the use of therapeutic footwear with a rigid rocker sole in patients with diabetes with polyneuropathy and history of diabetic foot ulcer to reduce the risk of plantar ulcer recurrence.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02995863."
https://openalex.org/W2957877311,"Exposure to air pollution particulate matter (PM) and tuberculosis (TB) are two of the leading global public health challenges affecting low and middle income countries. An estimated 4.26 million premature deaths are attributable to household air pollution and an additional 4.1 million to outdoor air pollution annually. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) infects a large proportion of the world's population with the risk for TB development increasing during immunosuppressing conditions. There is strong evidence that such immunosuppressive conditions develop during household air pollution exposure, which increases rates of TB development. Exposure to urban air pollution has been shown to alter the outcome of TB therapy. Here we examined whether in vitro exposure to urban air pollution PM alters human immune responses to M.tb. PM2.5 and PM10 (aerodynamic diameters <2.5μm, <10μm) were collected monthly from rainy, cold-dry and warm-dry seasons in Iztapalapa, a highly populated TB-endemic municipality of Mexico City with elevated outdoor air pollution levels. We evaluated the effects of seasonality and size of PM on cytotoxicity and antimycobacterial host immunity in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA)+ and IGRA- healthy study subjects. PM10 from cold-dry and warm-dry seasons induced the highest cytotoxicity in PBMC. With the exception of PM2.5 from the cold-dry season, pre-exposure to all seasonal PM reduced M.tb phagocytosis by PBMC. Furthermore, M.tb-induced IFN-γ production was suppressed in PM2.5 and PM10-pre-exposed PBMC from IGRA+ subjects. This observation coincides with the reduced expression of M.tb-induced T-bet, a transcription factor regulating IFN-γ expression in T cells. Pre-exposure to PM10 compared to PM2.5 led to greater loss of M.tb growth control. Exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 collected in different seasons differentially impairs M.tb-induced human host immunity, suggesting biological mechanisms underlying altered M.tb infection and TB treatment outcomes during air pollution exposures."
https://openalex.org/W2960415539,"Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum herbicide that is used worldwide. It represents a potential harm to surface water, and when commercially mixed with surfactants, its uptake is greatly magnified. The most well-known glyphosate-based product is Roundup. This herbicide is potentially an endocrine disruptor and many studies have shown the cytotoxicity potential of glyphosate-based herbicides. In breast cancer (BC) cell lines it has been demonstrated that glyphosate can induce cellular proliferation via estrogen receptors. Therefore, we aimed to identify gene expression changes in ER+ and ER- BC cell lines treated with Roundup and AMPA, to address changes in canonical pathways that would be related or not with the ER pathway, which we believe could interfere with cell proliferation. Using the Human Transcriptome Arrays 2.0, we identified gene expression changes in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 exposed to low concentrations and short exposure time to Roundup Original and AMPA. The results showed that at low concentration (0.05% Roundup) and short exposure (48h), both cell lines suffered deregulation of 11 canonical pathways, the most important being cell cycle and DNA damage repair pathways. Enrichment analysis showed similar results, except that MDA-MB-468 altered mainly metabolic processes. In contrast, 48h 10mM AMPA showed fewer differentially expressed genes, but also mainly related with metabolic processes. Our findings suggest that Roundup affects survival due to cell cycle deregulation and metabolism changes that may alter mitochondrial oxygen consumption, increase ROS levels, induce hypoxia, damage DNA repair, cause mutation accumulation and ultimately cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the effects of Roundup and AMPA on gene expression in triple negative BC cells. Therefore, we conclude that both compounds can cause cellular damage at low doses in a relatively short period of time in these two models, mainly affecting cell cycle and DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W2959929769,"Bacterial Panicle Blight (BPB), caused by Burkholderia glumae, is a bacterial disease in rice (Oryza sativa) that reduces rice yield and quality for producers and consequently creates higher market prices for consumers. BPB is caused by the simultaneous occurrence of high daily minimum temperatures (~22°C) and relative humidity (~77%), which may increase under the current scenario of global warming. This study hypothesized that the economic damage from warming may cause an increase in economic losses, though at a decreasing rate per degree. Thus, this study estimates the yield losses associated with BPB occurrences at the county level in the Mid-South United States (US) for annual rice production in 2003-2013 and under +1-3°C warming scenarios using daily weather information with appropriate thresholds. From the estimated losses, the total production potential of a BPB-resistant rice was quantified using a spatial equilibrium trade model to further estimate market welfare changes with the counterfactual scenario that all US county-level rice production were BPB resistant. Results from the study indicate that the alleviation of BPB would represent a $69 million USD increase in consumer surplus in the US and a concomitant increase in rice production that would feed an additional 1.46 million people annually assuming a global average consumption of 54 Kg per person. Under the 1°C warming scenario, BPB occurrences and production losses would cause price increases for rice and subsequently result in a $112 million USD annual decrease in consumer surplus in the US and a loss of production equivalent to feeding 2.17 million people. Under a 3°C warming scenario, production losses due to BPB cause an annual reduction of $204 million USD in consumer surplus in the US, and a loss in production sufficient to feed 3.98 million people a year. As global warming intensifies, BPB could become a more common and formidable rice disease to combat, and breeding for BPB resistance would be the primary line-of-defense as currently no effective chemical options are available. The results of this study inform agriculturalists, policymakers, and economists about the value of BPB-resistance in the international rice market and also help support efforts to focus future breeding toward climate change impact resilience."
https://openalex.org/W2960173629,"Mindfulness interventions have garnered significant attention as a complementary health treatment for many physical and psychological conditions. While some research has shown that mindfulness training can decrease psychological and physiological stress responses, it remains unclear whether mindfulness training impacts inflammation-a predictor of poor health outcomes. In addition, little research has examined the active components of mindfulness that may drive health-related improvements. Here, we provide data from two 3-arm randomized controlled trials that examined the effect of mindfulness training on inflammation in stressed community adults. Specifically, we examined whether training individuals to have an accepting attitude towards present moment experiences is a key emotion regulation skill that can lead to decreases in inflammation. Both studies randomly assigned participants to one of three conditions: mindfulness training that taught both attention monitoring and acceptance skills (Monitor+Accept); mindfulness training teaching monitoring without the acceptance component (Monitor Only); or a control condition. Study 1 employed a novel 2-week smartphone-based intervention and Study 2 employed a standard 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) intervention. We hypothesized that Monitor+Accept training would lead to reductions in the inflammatory biomarker C-Reactive Protein (CRP) compared to Monitor Only training and control groups. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that Monitor+Accept mindfulness training did not lead to reductions in CRP. Exploratory analyses combining study subsamples, however, suggest that both mindfulness interventions may reduce CRP in populations at risk for systemic inflammation-midlife-to-older adults and individuals with high BMI. Overall, the present studies contribute significantly to the question of whether mindfulness interventions can reduce systemic markers of low-grade inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2961303963,"Several studies have recently applied sentiment-based lexicons to Twitter to gauge local sentiment to understand health behaviors and outcomes for local areas. While this research has demonstrated the vast potential of this approach, lingering questions remain regarding the validity of Twitter mining and surveillance in local health research. First, how well does this approach predict health outcomes at very local scales, such as neighborhoods? Second, how robust are the findings garnered from sentiment signals when accounting for spatial effects? To evaluate these questions, we link 2,076,025 tweets from 66,219 distinct users in the city of San Diego over the period of 2014-12-06 to 2017-05-24 to the 500 Cities Project data and 2010-2014 American Community Survey data. We determine how well sentiment predicts self-rated mental health, sleep quality, and heart disease at a census tract level, controlling for neighborhood characteristics and spatial autocorrelation. We find that sentiment is related to some outcomes on its own, but these relationships are not present when controlling for other neighborhood factors. Evaluating our encoding strategy more closely, we discuss the limitations of existing measures of neighborhood sentiment, calling for more attention to how race/ethnicity and socio-economic status play into inferences drawn from such measures."
https://openalex.org/W2958119992,"JNK1 plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis in response to the osteoclastogenic cytokine receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). JNK1 is widely accepted as an autophagy regulator under stress conditions. However, the role of JNK1-mediated autophagy in osteoclastogenesis remains largely unknown. In the current study, our data showed that JNK1 inhibition by a pharmacological inhibitor or RNA interference significantly reduced the autophagic response induced by RANKL in osteoclast precursors (OCPs) derived from bone marrow-derived macrophages. Overexpression of the key autophagy protein Beclin1 rescued autophagy deficiency and osteoclastogenesis in the presence of a JNK inhibitor (SP600125). In contrast, JNK activator (anisomycin)-induced autophagy was blocked by Beclin1 knockdown in OCPs. In addition, JNK1 inhibition increased apoptosis and blocked autophagy, whereas overexpression of Beclin1 reversed the enhanced apoptosis induced by JNK1 inhibition in OCPs. Furthermore, RANKL could induce the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, subsequently dissociating Beclin1 from the Bcl-2-Beclin1 complex, which could be blocked by JNK1 inhibition. Collectively, this study revealed that JNK1 regulated osteoclastogenesis by activating Bcl-2-Beclin1-autophagy signaling in addition to the classic c-Jun/activator protein 1 pathway, which provided the first evidence for the contribution of JNK1 signaling to OCP autophagy and the autophagic mechanism underlying JNK1-regulated osteoclastogenesis. An important osteoclastogenesis-regulating signaling pathway (JNK1-Bcl-2-Beclin1-autophagy activation) was identified, which provides novel potential targets for the clinical therapy of metabolic bone diseases.—Ke, D., Ji, L., Wang, Y., Fu, X., Chen, J., Wang, F., Zhao, D., Xue, Y., Lan, X., Hou, J.

https://openalex.org/W2958459540,"Waterlogging stress is one of the most important abiotic stresses limiting sorghum growth and development. Consequently, the responses of sorghum to waterlogging must be monitored and studied. This study investigated changes in the leaf water status, xylem exudation rate, leaf anatomical structure, leaf temperature and photosynthetic performance. Waterlogging-tolerant (Jinuoliang 01, abbreviated JN01) and waterlogging-sensitive (Jinza 31, abbreviated JZ31) sorghum cultivars were planted in pots. The experiment was carried out using a split block design with three replications. Waterlogging stress was imposed at the sorghum five-leaf stage. The leaf free water content (FWC) and relative water content (RWC) decreased under the waterlogged condition. The leaf thickness was thinner under the waterlogged condition, and the main changes occurred in the upper epidermal and mesophyll cells. Gas exchange parameters and the xylem exudation rate were also restrained by waterlogging; however, greater responses of these parameters were observed in JZ31. JZ31 had a higher leaf-air temperature difference (ΔT) than JN01. We found that changes in ΔT were always consistent with changes in the RWC and the gas exchange parameters. ΔT was significantly associated with the leaf RWC, photosynthetic rate (Pn) and transpiration rate (Tr). The results suggest that ΔT may be an indicator reflecting the water status in leaves and can be used to evaluate the tolerance of sorghum to waterlogging."
https://openalex.org/W2959957459,"Liver fibrosis is an important pathologic process in injured liver tissues. A protein kinase, receptor-interacting protein (RIP)3, plays a crucial role in mediating different diseases. However, the role of RIP3 in macrophages in liver fibrosis has not yet been studied. In our study, we found that RIP3 expression was up-regulated in liver tissues and macrophages of humans and mice with liver fibrosis. Absence of RIP3 in macrophages could alleviate inflammation and macrophage or neutrophil accumulation in mice after carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) or bile duct ligation (BDL) treatment. Importantly, RIP3 deficiency in macrophages could decrease CCl4-induced and BDL-induced liver fibrosis in mice. Moreover, RIP3 deficiency could inhibit the TLR4–NF-κB pathway through suppressing Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK)l in macrophages. To explore the connection of ROCK1 and RIP3 in macrophages of mice with liver fibrosis in vivo, ROCK1-overexpressed macrophages were infused to RIP3-deficient mice, which resulted in increased inflammation and liver fibrosis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that RIP3 plays a crucial proinflammatory role in liver fibrosis by regulating the ROCK1–TLR4–NF-κB signaling pathway in macrophages and therefore may be a potential therapeutic target for immune-mediated liver fibrosis.—Wei, S., Zhou, H., Wang, Q., Zhou, S., Li, C, Liu, R., Qiu, J., Shi, C, Lu, L.

https://openalex.org/W2961822874,"Most aspects of our lives are governed by large, highly developed institutions that integrate several governance tasks under one authority structure. But theorists differ as to the mechanisms that drive the development of such concentrated governance systems from rudimentary beginnings. Is the emergence of integrated governance schemes a symptom of consolidation of authority by small status groups? Or does integration occur because a complex institution has more potential responses to a complex environment? Here we examine the emergence of complex governance regimes in 5,000 sovereign, resource-constrained, self-governing online communities, ranging in scale from one to thousands of users. Each community begins with no community members and no governance infrastructure. As communities grow, they are subject to selection pressures that keep better managed servers better populated. We identify predictors of community success and test the hypothesis that governance complexity can enhance community fitness. We find that what predicts success depends on size: changes in complexity predict increased success with larger population servers. Specifically, governance rules in a large successful community are more numerous and broader in scope. They also tend to rely more on rules that concentrate power in administrators, and on rules that manage bad behavior and limited server resources. Overall, this work is consistent with theories that formal integrated governance systems emerge to organize collective responses to interdependent resource management problems, especially as factors such as population size exacerbate those problems."
https://openalex.org/W2958894699,"The genus Callistemon comprises evergreen shrubs or small trees, widely cultivated as ornamentals and for essential oil production. Callistemon is well-recognized in folk medicine for its anti-cough, anti-bronchitis, and insecticidal activities. In the current study, we profiled the essential oil composition of the leaves of C. citrinus, C. rigidus and C. viminalis (Myrtaceae) collected during different seasons by GLC-MS coupled to multivariate data analysis. Antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities of Callistemon essential oils were evaluated. A total of 29 compounds were tentatively identified. Oxygenated monoterpenes dominated in essential oils, where eucalyptol represented the major constituent in the three Callistemon species in all seasons. Multivariate data analysis including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) were applied to discriminate between different Callistemon species in each season and to investigate any correlation between the metabolic profile of each species within different seasons. As expected, PCA plot could discriminate the three Callistemon species in the four seasons. The dendrogram from HCA confirmed the results of PCA as it showed the same segregation pattern regarding the discrimination of different Callistemon species. C. viminalis showed more pronounced antioxidant activity than C. citrinus, exhibiting IC50 values of 1.40 mg/mL and 1.77 mg/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, C. rigidus showed very weak antioxidant activity. All oils showed membrane stabilization activity in hypotonic solution induced haemolysis assay, where C. viminalis showed potent membrane stabilizing activity exhibiting IC50 value of 25.6 μg/mL comparable to that of the standard drug, indomethacin (17.02 μg/mL). Nevertheless, Callistemon essential oils were not cytotoxic in HCT-116 and Hela human cancer cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2961733437,"Simulator imperfection, often known as model error, is ubiquitous in practical data assimilation problems. Despite the enormous efforts dedicated to addressing this problem, properly handling simulator imperfection in data assimilation remains to be a challenging task. In this work, we propose an approach to dealing with simulator imperfection from a point of view of functional approximation that can be implemented through a certain machine learning method, such as kernel-based learning adopted in the current work. To this end, we start from considering a class of supervised learning problems, and then identify similarities between supervised learning and variational data assimilation. These similarities found the basis for us to develop an ensemble-based learning framework to tackle supervised learning problems, while achieving various advantages of ensemble-based methods over the variational ones. After establishing the ensemble-based learning framework, we proceed to investigate the integration of ensemble-based learning into an ensemble-based data assimilation framework to handle simulator imperfection. In the course of our investigations, we also develop a strategy to tackle the issue of multi-modality in supervised-learning problems, and transfer this strategy to data assimilation problems to help improve assimilation performance. For demonstration, we apply the ensemble-based learning framework and the integrated, ensemble-based data assimilation framework to a supervised learning problem and a data assimilation problem with an imperfect forward simulator, respectively. The experiment results indicate that both frameworks achieve good performance in relevant case studies, and that functional approximation through machine learning may serve as a viable way to account for simulator imperfection in data assimilation problems."
https://openalex.org/W2957885510,"Background 2-Cl-C.OXT-A (COA-Cl) is a novel synthesized adenosine analog that activates Sphingosine-1-phosphate 1 receptor (S1P1R) and combines with the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) in G proteins and was shown to enhance angiogenesis and improve the brain function in rat stroke models. However, the role of COA-Cl in hearts remains unclear. COA-Cl, which has a similar structure to xanthine derivatives, has the potential to suppress phosphodiesterase (PDE), which is an important factor involved in the beating of heart muscle. Methods and results Cardiac organoids with fibroblasts, human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes (hiPSC-CMs), and hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-ECs) were cultured until they started beating. The beating and contraction of organoids were observed before and after the application of COA-Cl. COA-Cl significantly increased the beating rate and fractional area change in organoids. To elucidate the mechanism underlying these effects of COA-Cl on cardiac myocytes, pure hiPSC-CM spheroids were evaluated in the presence/absence of Suramin (antagonist of A1R). The effects of COA-Cl, SEW2871 (direct stimulator of S1P1R), two positive inotropes (Isoproterenol [ISO] and Forskolin [FSK]), and negative inotrope (Propranolol [PRP]) on spheroids were assessed based on the beating rates and cAMP levels. COA-Cl stimulated the beating rates about 1.5-fold compared with ISO and FSK, while PRP suppressed the beating rate. However, no marked changes were observed with SEW2871. COA-Cl, ISO, and FSK increased the cAMP level. In contrast, the level of cAMP did not change with PRP or SEW2871 treatment. The results were the same in the presence of Suramin as absence. Furthermore, an enzyme analysis showed that COA-Cl suppressed the PDE activity by half. Conclusions COA-Cl, which has neovascularization effects, suppressed PDE and increased the contraction of cardiac organoids, independent of S1P1R and A1R. These findings suggest that COA-Cl may be useful as an inotropic agent for promoting angiogenesis in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2953121490,"There is growing evidence that leaders’ effectiveness derives in part from their creation of a sense of identity that is shared by members of a group they are attempting to lead (i.e., their identity entrepreneurship). Little is known, however, about the impact of identity entrepreneurship in sport and exercise settings, particularly in relation to its effect on group members’ effort and performance. Using a pre-post between subjects experimental design, we examined the effect of leaders’ identity entrepreneurship on group members’ effort and performance during 5km cycling time trials. Following a baseline session (in which time trials were completed individually), participants (N = 72) were randomly allocated to either a high or low identity entrepreneurship condition, and further randomly divided into groups of five (including a leader who was a confederate). In the subsequent test sessions (which participants attended with their fellow group members), leaders displayed either high or low identity entrepreneurship behaviors. Results indicated that, compared to participants in the low identity entrepreneurship condition, those in the high identity entrepreneurship condition maintained greater effort (maximum heart rate), and demonstrated improved (rather than poorer) performance (average power output in the first 60 seconds of time trials). Examination of pacing showed that the largest increases in participants’ average power output occurred in the early stages of their second time trials for those in the high identity entrepreneurship condition only. Results provide causal evidence that leaders who create a shared sense of identity among team members are able to inspire greater participant effort and performance."
https://openalex.org/W2957906026,"Why do people who care about the environment adopt behaviours that are not consistent with their beliefs? Previous studies approach this as a case of cognitive dissonance, researchers looking into the strategies through which people reduce gaps between their attitudes and their behaviours. Here we start from the premise that there is no dissonance, and that people have consistent reasons of why they are doing what they are doing. The research task is then to shed light on these reasons. Using Q-methodology, a mixed quantitative-qualitative approach, we interviewed 42 environmentally-minded researchers asking them why they eat meat. Our interviewees were aware of and cared about the environmental and ethical impacts of meat eating, but reasoned that they eat meat because either technological, or political changes are more important than what they personally do, because of doubts about the impact of personal action in a complex world, or simply because they lack the determination to stop eating meat. Our analysis suggests that policies and messages that try to educate or guilt meat-eaters are unlikely to work with those well aware of the impacts of their actions."

Method A 5-year (2012–2016) retrospective analysis of electronic TB surveillance data from Kilifi County, Kenya. The outcome was all-cause mortality within 180 days after starting TB treatment. The risk factors examined were demographic and clinical features at the time of starting anti-TB treatment. We performed survival analysis with time at risk defined from day of starting TB treatment to time of death, lost-to-follow-up or completing treatment. To account for ‘lost-to-follow-up’ we used competing risk analysis method to examine risk factors for all-cause mortality. Results 10,717 patients receiving TB treatment, median (IQR) age 33 (24–45) years were analyzed; 3,163 (30%) were HIV infected. Overall, 585 (5.5%) patients died; mortality rate of 12.2 (95% CI 11.3–13.3) deaths per 100 person-years (PY). Mortality rate increased from 7.8 (95% CI 6.4–9.5) in 2012 to 17.7 (95% CI 14.9–21.1) in 2016 per 100PY (Ptrend<0.0001). 449/585 (77%) of the deaths occurred within the first three months after starting TB treatment. The median time to death (IQR) declined from 87 (40–100) days in 2012 to 46 (18–83) days in 2016 (Ptrend = 0·04). Mortality rate per 100PY was 7.3 (95% CI 6.5–7.8) and 23.1 (95% CI 20.8–25.7) among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected patients respectively. Age, being a female, extrapulmonary TB, being undernourished, HIV infected and year of diagnosis were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions We found most deaths occurred within three months and an increasing mortality rate during the time under review among patients on TB treatment. Our results therefore warrant further investigation to explore host, disease or health system factors that may explain this trend."
https://openalex.org/W2961086606,"The mature lexicon encodes semantic relations between words, and these connections can alternately facilitate and interfere with language processing. We explore the emergence of these processing dynamics in 18-month-olds (N = 79) using a novel approach that calculates individualized semantic structure at multiple granularities in participants’ productive vocabularies. Participants completed two interleaved eye-tracked word recognition tasks involving semantically unrelated and related picture contexts, which sought to measure the impact of lexical facilitation and interference on processing, respectively. Semantic structure and vocabulary size differentially impacted processing in each task. Category level structure facilitated word recognition in 18-month-olds with smaller productive vocabularies, while overall lexical connectivity interfered with word recognition for toddlers with relatively larger vocabularies. The results suggest that, while semantic structure at multiple granularities is measurable even in small lexicons, mechanisms of semantic interference and facilitation are driven by the development of structure at different granularities. We consider these findings in light of accounts of adult word recognition that posits that different levels of structure index strong and weak activation from nearby and distant semantic neighbors. We also consider further directions for developmental change in these patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2956255781,"Objective An ideal disease modifying osteoarthritis drug (DMOAD) has chondroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects. This study describes the production and characterization of a canine IL4-10 fusion protein (IL4-10 FP) and evaluates its in vivo DMOAD activity in a canine model of osteoarthritis (OA). Design The canine Groove model was used as an in vivo model of degenerative knee OA. Six weeks after OA induction dogs were intra-articularly injected weekly, for ten weeks, with either IL4-10 FP or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In addition to the use of human IL4-10 FP, canine IL4-10 FP was developed and characterized in vitro, and tested in vivo. Force plate analysis (FPA) was performed to analyze joint loading as a proxy measure for pain. After ten weeks dogs were euthanized and cartilage and synovial tissue samples were analyzed by histochemistry (OARSI scores) and biochemistry (cartilage proteoglycan turnover). Results Repetitive intra-articular injections with human IL4-10 FP led to antibody formation, that blocked its functional activity. Therefore, a canine IL4-10 FP was developed, which completely inhibited LPS-induced TNFα production by canine blood cells, and increased proteoglycan synthesis of canine cartilage in vitro (p = 0.043). In vivo, canine IL4-10 FP restored the, by OA impaired, joint loading (p = 0.002) and increased cartilage proteoglycan content (p = 0.029). Conclusions This first study on the potential DMOAD activity upon prolonged repeated treatment with IL4-10 FP demonstrates that a species-specific variant has anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects in vitro and chondroprotective and analgesic effects in vivo. These data warrant further research on the DMOAD potential of the IL4-10 FP."
https://openalex.org/W2960846160,"Two dimensions of temperament, namely, (high levels of) novelty seeking and (low levels of) harm avoidance are related to substance addictions. However, their implications for smartphone addiction remain unexplored. Medical students are heavy smartphone users. Accordingly, screening for the risk of smartphone addiction based on individual differences in temperament can facilitate the identification of the best possible prevention strategy. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the relationship between temperament and the vulnerability to smartphone addiction among medical students in Jakarta, Indonesia. The research study adopted a cross-sectional research design and used a simple random sampling technique. The Indonesian versions of the Temperament and Character Inventory and the Smartphone Addiction Scale were used to measure the study variables. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the relationships between demographic factors, patterns of smartphone use, temperament, and vulnerability to smartphone addiction. A majority of the 185 participants were found to have the following temperament profile: low levels of novelty seeking and high levels of reward dependence and harm avoidance. The average duration of daily smartphone use was 7.83 hours (SD = 4.03) and the age at first smartphone use was 7.62 years (SD = 2.60). The respondents used smartphone to communicate with other people and access social media. A high level of harm avoidance was significantly associated with the risk of smartphone addiction (Odds Ratio [OR] = 2.04, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.12, 3.70). The findings suggest that smartphone addiction is comparable to other addictive behaviors. Further, harm avoidance increases the risk of smartphone addiction. Therefore, the risk of smartphone addiction among medical students must be ascertained based on their temperament profiles."
https://openalex.org/W2961907177,"We investigated whether use of American College of Radiology thyroid imaging report and data system (ACR TIRADS) in combination with K-RAS mutation status may facilitate risk stratification of patients with cytological Bethesda Category III and IV thyroid nodules. Ultrasonographic, cytological, and histopathological diagnoses were retrospectively correlated with K-RAS mutation status in a series of 43 cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules (CITNs) that were referred for surgical excision. K-RAS mutations were detected in 8/43 (18.6%) fine-needle aspiration (FNA) samples as against 11/43 (25.6%) surgical specimens. ACR TIRADS level (TR) TR3 lesions had a malignancy risk of 40%; the K-RAS mutation rate in FNA samples and surgical specimens of category TR3 lesions was 40% and 60%, respectively. K-RAS mutation-positive malignancy was significantly more frequently detected in follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN) lesions than that in atypia or follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) (P<0.01). Combined use of ACR TIRADS (TR5 as the diagnostic threshold) and K-RAS mutation status helped identify 83.3% (10/12) malignant nodules (58.6% specificity, 45.5% positive predictive value, 89.5% negative predictive value, and 65.9% accuracy). CITNs with ACR TIRADS category TR3 showed an unexpectedly high risk of malignancy. K-RAS mutation-positive FN/SFN nodules have a 50% risk of malignancy and surgery should be recommended. Combined use of ACR TIRADS and K-RAS mutation may facilitate risk-stratification of patients with CITNs. The high negative predictive value (NPV) for malignancy seems sufficient to allow conservative management of patients with active surveillance."

https://openalex.org/W2958369447,"Mycoplasma anatis, M. anseris, M. cloacale and M. sp. 1220 colonise geese and ducks, and could be associated with infections of avian respiratory and nervous systems, cause mild to severe inflammation of cloaca and genital tracts, and embryo lethality. Co-occurrence of these Mycoplasma species in waterfowl is frequently detected and the identification of these mycoplasmas to the species level at a regular microbiology laboratory is difficult due to their similar morphological, cultural and biochemical properties. Moreover, species differentiation is only possible based on the sequence analysis of the product of a genus-specific PCR assay. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to develop an effective and robust method for the identification of these species in avian clinical specimens. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using species-specific primers, which target housekeeping genes in order to identify these species, were designed in the present study. The developed PCR assays can precisely identify these four mycoplasmas to the species level directly from DNA samples extracted from clinical specimens, and no cross-amplification was observed among these species and with other well-known avian mycoplasmas. The average sensitivity of the assays was 101−102 genomic equivalents per reaction. These conventional PCR assays can be run simultaneously at the same PCR cycling program, and the species can be differentiated directly (without sequence analysis) by gel electrophoresis due to the specific sizes of the amplicons. In conclusion, the presented species-specific assays were found to be suitable for routine use at regular veterinary diagnostic laboratories and promote the rapid, simple and cost-effective differentiation of these waterfowl Mycoplasma species."
https://openalex.org/W2956319007,"Background Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The aim of this analysis was to examine the association between RBC transfusions and long-term survival for patients undergoing elective open infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair with up to 15 years of follow-up. Methods Prospective cohort study using data from The Danish Vascular Registry from 2000–2015. Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Secondary endpoints were in-hospital complications. Transfused patients were divided into subgroups based on received RBC transfusions (1, 2–3, 4–5 or > 5). Using Cox regression multi-adjusted analysis, non-transfused patients were compared to transfused patients (1, 2–3, 4–5, >5 transfusions) for both primary and secondary endpoints. Results There were 3 876 patients included with a mean survival of 9.1 years. There were 801 patients who did not receive transfusions. Overall 30-day mortality was 3.1% (121 patients) and 3.6% (112) for all transfused patients. For the five subgroups 30-day mortality was: No transfusions 1.1% (9 patients), 1 RBC 1.2% (4 patients), 2–3 RBC 2.2% (26 patients), 4–5 RBC 1.9% (14 patients) and > 5 RBC 7.9% (68 patients). After receiving RBCs, the hazard ratio for death was 1.54 (95% CI 1.27–1.85) compared to non-transfused patients. There was a significant increase in mortality when receiving 2–3 RBC: HR 1.32 (95% CI 1.07–1.62), 4–5 RBC: 1.64 (1.32–2.03) and >5 RBC: 1.96 (1.27–1.85) in a multi-adjusted model. Conclusion There is a dose-dependent association between RBC transfusions received during elective AAA repair and an increase in short- and long-term mortality. Approximately 25% of included patients had preoperative anemia. These findings should raise awareness regarding potentially unnecessary and harmful RBC transfusions."
https://openalex.org/W2957659820,"Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Vascular factors play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of glaucoma. Expressed in the vascular endothelium, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2J2 is one of the CYP epoxygenases that metabolize arachidonic acid to produce epoxyeicosatrienoic acids and exert pleiotropic protective effects on the vasculature. In the present study, we investigated whether endothelium-specific overexpression of CYP2J2 (tie2-CYP2J2-Tr) protects against retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss induced by glaucoma and in what way retinal vessels are involved in this process. We used a glaucoma model of retinal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats and found that endothelium-specific overexpression of CYP2J2 attenuated RGC loss induced by retinal I/R. Moreover, retinal I/R triggered retinal vascular senescence, indicated by up-regulated senescence-related proteins p53, p16, and β-galactosidase activity. The senescent endothelial cells resulted in pericyte loss and increased endothelial secretion of matrix metallopeptidase 9, which further contributed to RGC loss. CYP2J2 overexpression alleviated vascular senescence, pericyte loss, and matrix metallopeptidase 9 secretion. CYP2J2 suppressed endothelial senescence by down-regulating senescence-associated proteins p53 and p16. These 2 proteins were positively regulated by microRNA-128-3p, which was inhibited by CYP2J2. These results suggest that CYP2J2 protects against endothelial senescence and RGC loss in glaucoma, a discovery that may lead to the development of a potential treatment strategy for glaucoma.-Huang, J., Zhao, Q., Li, M., Duan, Q., Zhao, Y., Zhang, H.

https://openalex.org/W2962466764,"Clavibacter is an agriculturally important genus comprising a single species, Clavibacter michiganensis, and multiple subspecies, including, C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis which causes Goss's wilt/blight of corn, accounts for high yield losses and is listed among the five most significant diseases of corn in the United States of America. Our research objective was to develop a robust and rapid multiplex TaqMan real-time PCR (qPCR) to detect C. michiganensis in general and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis with enhanced reliability and accuracy by adding non-complementary AT sequences to the 5’ end of the forward and reverse primers. Comparative genomic analyses were performed to identify unique and conserved gene regions for primer and probe design. The unique genomic regions, ABC transporter ATP-binding protein CDS/ABC-transporter permease and MFS transporter were determined for specific detection of C. michiganensis and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis, respectively. The AT-rich sequences at the 5’ position of the primers enhanced the reaction efficiency and sensitivity of rapid qPCR cycling; the reliability, accuracy and high efficiency of the developed assay was confirmed after testing with 59 strains from inclusivity and exclusivity panels–no false positives or false negatives were detected. The assays were also validated through naturally and artificially infected corn plant samples; all samples were detected for C. michiganensis and C. m. subsp. nebraskensis with 100% accuracy. The assay with 5’ AT-rich sequences detected up to 10- and 100-fg of C. michiganensis and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis genome targets, respectively. No adverse effect was observed when sensitivity assays were spiked with host genomic DNA. Addition of 5’ AT-rich sequences enhanced the qPCR reaction efficiency from 0.82 (M = -3.83) and 0.91 (M = -3.54) to 1.04 (with optimum slope value; M = -3.23) for both C. michiganensis and C. michiganensis subsp. nebraskensis, respectively; an increase of 10-fold sensitivity was also obtained with C. michiganensis primer set. The methodology proposed here can be used to optimize reaction efficiency and to harmonize diagnostic protocols which have prodigious applications in routine diagnostics, biosecurity and microbial forensics."
https://openalex.org/W2956677480,"The Sustainable Energy Development Authority of Malaysia (SEDA) regularly receives complaints about damaged components and distribution boards of PV systems due to lightning strikes. Permanent and momentary interruptions of distribution circuits may also occur from the disturbance. In this paper, a solar PV Rooftop system (3.91 kWp) provided by SEDA was modelled in the PSCAD/EMTDC. The Heidler function was used as a lightning current waveform model to analyse the transient current and voltage at two different points susceptible to the influence of lightning events such as different lightning current wave shape, standard lightning current and non-standard lightning current. This study examines the effect on the system components when lightning directly strikes at two different points of the installation. The two points lie between the inverter and the solar PV array and between inverter and grid. Exceptionally high current and voltage due to the direct lightning strike on a certain point of a PV Rooftop system was also studied. The result of this case study is observed with and without the inclusion of surge protective devices (SPDs). The parameters used were 31 kA of peak current, 10 metres cable length and lightning impulse current wave shape of 8/20μs. The high current and voltage at P1 striking point were 31 kA and 2397 kV, respectively. As for the AC part, the current and voltage values were found to be 5.97 kA and 5392 kV, respectively.Therefore, SPDs with suitable rating provided by SEDA were deployed. Results showed that high transient current voltage is expected to clamp sharply at the values of 1.915 kV and 0 A at the P1 striking point. As for the AC part, the current and voltage values were found to be 0 kA and 0.751 V, respectively. Varying lightning impulse current wave shapes at striking point P2 showed that the highest voltage was obtained at waveshape 10/350 μs at 11277 kV followed by wave shapes of 2/70 μs, 8/20 μs and 0.7/6 μs. The high value of transient voltage was clamped at a lower level of 2.029 kV. Different lightning amplitudes were also applied, ranging from 2-200 kA selected based on the CIGRE distribution. It showed that the current and voltage at P1 and P2 were directly proportional. Therefore, the SPD will be designed at an acceptable rating and proper position of SPD installation at solar PV Rooftop will be proposed. The results obtained in this study can then be utilised to appropriately assign a SPD to protect the PV systems that are connected to the grid. Installing SPDs without considering the needs of lightning protection zones would expose the expensive equipment to potential damage even though the proper energy coordination of SPDs is in place. As such, the simulation results provide a basis for controlling the impacts of direct lightning strikes on electrical equipment and power grids and thus justify SPD coordination to ensure the reliability of the system."
https://openalex.org/W2957882379,"Castor bean is an important seed oil crop. Castor oil is a highly demanded oil for several industrial uses. Currently, castor bean varieties suffer from low productivity and high risk of insect pests and diseases. It is in urgent need to mine elite genes from wild materials for castor breeding. 29 pairs of polymorphic SRAP primers out of 361 pairs were used to analyse the genetic diversity of 473 wild castor materials from South China. 203 bands were amplified by the 29 pairs of primers, of which 169 bands were polymorphic, with a polymorphic percentage of 83.25%. With an average number of alleles per locus (Ap) of 1.801, average number of effective alleles per locus (Ae) of 1.713 and average percentage of polymorphic loci (P) of 90.04%, these primers were proven to be useful and effective. Nei' genetic distance between the materials ranged from 1.04 to 25.02, with an average of 13.03. At the genetic distance of 25.02, the materials clustered into two major groups, consistent with the result of population structure analysis. However, more subgroups existed between 5.21 and 13.32. Although not all the materials from the same region were clustered in the same group, an obvious trend existed where the groups were related to regions to a great extent. Based on multiple indices, the genetic diversity of materials from Hainan was the lowest. However, there was not much difference between West Guangdong and Guangxi, although the former was slightly higher. Moderate genetic differentiation was observed in wild materials in South China. The genetic differentiation mainly occurred within population, with maximum differentiation in Guangxi, followed by West Guangdong and the minimum in Hainan. Nonetheless, there was an extensive geneflow between populations. The above results provided a direction for the conservation and breeding application of these materials."

The study presents the results of the genomic surveillance of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in the Czech Republic for the period of 2015–2017.


Material and methods 
The study set includes all available IMD isolates recovered in the Czech Republic and referred to the National Reference Laboratory for Meningococcal Infections in 2015–2017, a total of 89 Neissseria meningitidis isolates—from 2015 (n = 20), 2016 (n = 27), and from 2017 (n = 42). All isolates were studied by whole genome sequencing (WGS).


Results 
Serogroup B (MenB) was the most common, followed by serogroups C, W, and Y. Altogether 17 clonal complexes were identified, the most common of which was hypervirulent complex cc11, followed by complexes cc32, cc41/44, cc269, and cc865. Over the three study years, hypervirulent cc11 (MenC) showed an upward trend. The WGS method showed two clearly differentiated clusters of N. meningitidis C: P1.5,2:F3-3:ST-11 (cc11). The first cluster is represented by nine isolates, all of which are from 2017. The second cluster consisted of five isolates from 2016 and eight isolates from 2017. Their genetic discordance is illustrated by the changing nadA allele and subsequently by the variance in BAST type. Clonal complex cc269 (MenB) also increased over the time frame. WGS identified the presence of MenB vaccine antigen genes in all B and non-B isolates of N. meningitidis. Altogether 49 different Bexsero antigen sequence types (BAST) were identified and 10 combinations of these have not been previously described in the PubMLST database.


Conclusions 
The genomic surveillance of IMD in the Czech Republic provides data needed to update immunisation guidelines for this disease. WGS showed a higher discrimination power and provided more accurate data on molecular characteristics and genetic relationships among invasive N. meningitidis isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2959273757,"Background The world population is aging very rapidly and the impact is more severe in developing countries because of insufficient resources and low awareness of the challenges faced by older people. This study aimed to explore multimorbidity of older people in Myanmar and their health seeking behaviours. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in both urban and rural areas of Bago Region and Mon State during October 2016. A multistage sampling method was used to select 4,859 people aged 60 years and older. Participants were interviewed face-to-face using a questionnaire. Multinominal logistic regression was used to analyse data. Results More than half of the study participants (57.9%) reported at least one chronic condition in the last year and 33.2% reported two or more conditions (multimorbidity). The common conditions were hypertension (67.3%), arthritis (24.7%), arrhythmia (14.7%), coronary heart disease (13.8%) and diabetes (13.7%). A majority (61.7%) of participants with a chronic condition took western medicine. Older people usually saw a doctor (60.2%) or health assistant (21.9%) at a nearby clinic or rural health center; 1.6% reported seeing uncredentialed medical persons. Factors associated with multimorbidity were being female (adjusted Prevalence Ratio (aPR) = 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63–2.82) and having fair (aPR = 2.20, 95% CI 1.59–3.04) or poor self-reported health (aPR = 3.93, 95% CI 2.79–5.52). Those with less than middle school education (aPR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.25–0.99) and those living in rural areas (aPR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.62–0.98) were less likely to have multimorbidity. Older people in rural areas had less access to health care than their urban counterparts. Conclusion Chronic conditions are common among older people in Myanmar, with higher prevalence in women and in urban areas. The lower prevalence of chronic conditions in those who live in rural areas may be related to living a more traditional lifestyle."
https://openalex.org/W2959900506,"Although combined antiretroviral treatment (cART) has improved overall survival of HIV infected patients, liver fibrosis and liver related-mortality still constitute major challenges in HIV positive patients. Collagen accumulates in the liver during fibrogenesis. Recent studies showed that circulating levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) fragments might reflect degree of portal hypertension and fibrosis stage in liver disease. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between liver fibrosis assessed by Fibroscan and levels of the formation and degradation markers of type III and IV collagen in HIV positive patients receiving cART.116 HIV positive patients (82.7% male, median age 47 years) were enrolled into the study. Liver stiffness and liver fat content were determined using a Fibroscan with integrated CAP function. We quantified ECM formation and degradation fragments of collagen III and IV: PRO-C3, PRO-C4, C3M and C4M. These fragments were measured in peripheral serum by using specific ELISAs.Fifteen (12.9%) out of the 116 HIV positive patients had relevant fibrosis with a liver stiffness ≥ 7.1 kPa, and 79 patients had relevant steatosis with a CAP value > 248 dB/m. Circulating PRO-C3 levels significantly correlated with increasing degree of liver fibrosis assessed by Fibroscan (p = 0.0005), as well as with APRI score (p = 0.015). Interestingly, circulating PRO-C3 levels were significantly correlated with bilirubin (p = 0.022), reduced platelet count (p = 0.0008) and low albumin levels (p = 0.001), suggesting the association of type III collagen deposition with impaired liver function. None of the other measured ECM components significantly correlated with fibrosis or steatosis.The formation marker of type III collagen, PRO-C3 not only reflects liver fibrosis, but might also mirror liver dysfunction in HIV positive patients receiving cART. Therefore, the circulating levels of PRO-C3 might be suitable to monitor progression of liver fibrosis and deterioration of liver function in HIV positive patients receiving cART."

Aim To compare the learning outcome in terms of practical skills and knowledge of BLS after participating in learning activities related to BLS, with and without web-based education in cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Methods Laymen (n = 2,623) were cluster randomised to either BLS education or to web-based education in CVD before BLS training. The participants were assessed by a questionnaire for theoretical knowledge and then by a simulated scenario for practical skills. The total score for practical skills in BLS six months after training was the primary outcome. The total score for practical skills directly after training, separate variables and self-assessed knowledge, confidence and willingness, directly and six months after training, were the secondary outcomes. Results BLS with web-based education was more effective than BLS without web-based education and obtained a statistically significant higher total score for practical skills at six months (mean 58.8, SD 5.0 vs mean 58.0, SD 5.0; p = 0.03) and directly after training (mean 59.6, SD 4.8 vs mean 58.7, SD 4.9; p = 0.004). Conclusion A web-based education in CVD in addition to BLS training enhanced the learning outcome with a statistically significant higher total score for performed practical skills in BLS as compared to BLS training alone. However, in terms of the outcomes, the differences were minor, and the clinical relevance of our findings has a limited practical impact."
https://openalex.org/W2956817002,"Objective To investigate the accuracy and precision of ultrasound shear wave elasticity measurements as a function of target elasticity and acquisition depth. Materials and methods Using five ultrasound systems (VTQ, VTIQ, EPIQ 5, Aixplorer, and Aplio 500), two operators independently measured shear wave elasticities in two phantoms containing five different target elasticities (8±3, 14±4, 25±6, 45±8, and 80±12 kPa) at depths of 15, 30, 35, and 60 mm. Accuracy was assessed by evaluating measurement errors and the proportions of outliers, while factors affecting accuracy were assessed using logistic regression analysis. Measurement errors were defined as differences between the measured values and 1) the margins of the target elasticity, and 2) the median values of the target elasticity. Outliers were defined as measured values outside the margins of the target elasticity. Precision was assessed by calculating the reproducibility of measurements using the within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV). Results Mean measurement errors and the proportions of outliers were higher for high than for low target elasticities (p<0.001), but did not differ in relation to acquisition depth, either within an elastography system or across the different systems. Logistic regression analysis showed that target elasticity (p<0.001) significantly affected accuracy, whereas acquisition depth (p>0.05) did not. The wCV for the 80±12 kPa target (31.33%) was significantly higher than that for lower elasticity targets (6.96–10.43 kPa; p<0.001). The wCV did not differ across acquisition depths. The individual elastography systems showed consistent results. Conclusions Targets with high elasticity showed lower accuracy and lower precision than targets with low elasticity, while acquisition depth did not show consistent patterns in either accuracy or precision."

Numerous studies have explored the association between calcification and abdominal artery aneurysm. However, evidence regarding the association between AC and acute aortic dissection (AAD) is limited. We aimed to evaluate the association between AC-related variables and the development of intimal tear (IT) in patients with AAD.We conducted a retrospective observational study involving 64 patients with type A AAD and 32 patients with type B AAD from February, 2011 to January, 2017 at a tertiary referral medical center in Taiwan. We used the default analysis module ""calcification score analysis"" to calculate all the calcification variables, including AC scores and volume.We identified an association between AC and AAD. Patients with AAD had a greater AC volume in the aortic arch and greater AC scores for both the ascending aorta and the aortic arch than did patients without AAD. However, hypertension and coronary artery disease, rather than AC remained to be the independent risk factor for AAD in multivariate analysis. Patients with type A AAD had greater mean and cumulative AC volumes in the aortic arch, greater cumulative AC volumes in the whole aorta and higher cumulative AC scores in the aortic arch than did patients with type B AAD. ACs were superimposed on ITs in nearly half of the patients with AAD. In patients with type A AAD, AC was more commonly located distal to the IT and farther from the IT.We identified the associations between AC-related variables and the location of IT in patients with AAD. However, AC was not an independent risk factor for AAD. The distribution of AC was different between patients with type A and type B AAD."
https://openalex.org/W2958934106,"Background In 2017, 2.5 million newborns died, mainly from prematurity, infections, and intrapartum events. Preventing these deaths requires health systems to provide routine and emergency care at birth, and quality inpatient care for small and sick newborns. Defined levels of emergency obstetric care (EmOC) and standardised measurement of “signal functions” has improved tracking of maternal care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Levels of newborn care, particularly for small and sick newborns, and associated signal functions are still not consistently defined or tracked. Methods Between November 2016-November 2017, we conducted an online survey of professionals working in maternal and newborn health. We asked respondents to categorise 18 clinical care interventions that could act as potential signal functions for small and sick newborns to 3 levels of care they thought were appropriate for health systems in LMICs to provide: “routine care at birth”, “special care” and “intensive care”. We calculated the percentage of respondents that classified each intervention at each level of care and stratified responses to look at variation by respondent characteristics. Results Six interventions were classified to specific levels by more than 50% of respondents as “routine care at birth,” three interventions as “special care” and one as “intensive care”. Eight interventions were borderline between these care levels. Responses were more consistent for interventions with relevant WHO clinical care guidelines while more variation in respondents’ classification was observed in complex interventions that lack standards or guidelines. Respondents with experience in lower-income settings were more likely to assign a higher level of care for more complex interventions. Conclusions Results were consistent with known challenges of scaling up inpatient care in lower-income settings and underline the importance of comprehensive guidelines and standards for inpatient care. Further work is needed to develop a shortlist of newborn signal functions aligned with emergency obstetric care levels to track universal health coverage for mothers and their newborns."
https://openalex.org/W2961764161,"Noise is considered as one of the challenging problems in big cities. However, this noise could be utilized in producing energy especially in dense urban areas. Sound as a form of mechanical energy, it can be converted to electric energy through many approaches including heating, by using the diaphragm and through using piezoelectric materials. This research aims at utilizing noise through using piezoelectric materials as an approach of conversion to produce green sustainable electric energy that can be used to decrease the energy consumption from non-renewable sources and utilizing this energy in street lighting. The study was carried in three bus stations in Alexandria by having measurements during weekdays and weekends in order to study the noise produced in the selected stations and the amount of electric energy that could be produced and utilized in street lighting. The noise level index LDEN was calculated for each of the three selected locations. The equivalent noise level values were always exceeding the limits through the day, evening and night. At daytime they ranged between 75-85 dB which is higher that the permissible limit by 10-20 dB, at evening they ranged from 80-85 dB which is also higher than the permissible limit with 20-25 dB and at the night they ranged from 75-80 dB which is higher by 20-25 dB than the permissible limit. The research concluded that utilizing noise using the piezoelectric material is successful. The electric energy produced from an area of 1.45 m2 containing 690 piezoelectric QB220-503YB transducers at each of the selected stations was about 0.024 watt hr. This amount of electric energy is too small to be used in an application. So the application area should be maximized to hundreds of square meters to produce beneficial electric energy that can be used in lighting 1 LED street lamp or it can be stored and used when needed in applications that use greater amount of electric energy and this would help in reducing the energy consumed."
https://openalex.org/W2961917597,"The aim of this research was to improve nutritive value of fishmeal-based feed by lactobacilli in order to achieve satisfactory nutrient availability needed to support fish development. Feed was solid-state treated at a laboratory scale with the combination of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGHN14 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus BGT10 in different experimental settings, which included the variation of strain ratio, total lactobacilli concentration, percentage of moisture and duration of incubation. Short peptides, soluble proteins, phospho-, neutral and unsaturated lipids were quantified. Differences among treated and control feeds were evaluated by Student t-test, while Gaussian process regression (GPR) modeling was employed to simulate the incubation process and define the optimal treatment combination in the context of overall feed nutritional profile. Treatment duration was shown to be the critical determinant of final outcome, either as single factor or via interaction with strain ratio. Optimal nutrient balance was achieved with 12 h incubation period, 260% moisture, 75:25 and 50:50 BGHN14:BGT10 ratios and 200 mg of lactobacilli per g of dry feed. This study should serve as the basis for large-scale tests which would simulate on-farm production of both fishmeal-based and unconventional, lower cost aquafeed with added value."
https://openalex.org/W2961978147,"Uric acid has gained considerable attention as a potential neuroprotective agent in stroke during the last decades, however, its role in the pathophysiology of ischemic stroke remains poorly understood. A serial evaluation of uric acid levels during the acute phase of stroke and its association with infarct size on magnetic resonance imaging is lacking.We present a cohort study of 31 patients with ischemic stroke who were not candidates for thrombolysis according to current criteria at the time. We performed daily measurements of serum uric acid and total antioxidant capacity of plasma during the first week after symptoms onset and 30 days after. Infarct size was determined in the acute phase by a DWI sequence and the final infarct size with a control MRI (FLAIR) at day 30.Uric acid significantly decreases between days 2 to 6 compared to day 1, after adjustment by sex, age and DWI at diagnosis, with a nadir value at 72h. A mixed model analysis showed a negative association between DWI at diagnosis and uric acid evolution during the first week after stroke. Moreover, multivariable linear regression of uric acid values during follow up on DWI volumes demonstrated that DWI volume at diagnosis is negatively associated with uric acid levels at day 3 and 4. There were no significant associations between total antioxidant capacity of plasma and DWI at diagnosis, or FLAIR at any point.Patients with larger infarcts exhibited a significant decrease in serum uric acid levels, accounting for a more prominent reactive oxygen species scavenging activity with subsequent consumption and decay of this antioxidant. The different kinetics of total antioxidant capacity of plasma and serum uric acid levels suggests a specific role of uric acid in the antioxidant response in ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2957629143,"Microbial dysbiosis commonly occurs in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). Exogenous causes of dysbiosis such as antibiotics and diet are well described, but host derived causes are understudied. A20 is a potent regulator of signals triggered by microbial pattern molecules, and A20 regulates susceptibility to intestinal inflammation in mice and in humans. We now report that mice lacking A20 expression in dendritic cells, A20FL/FL CD11c-Cre mice (or A20dDC mice), spontaneously develop colitogenic intestinal dysbiosis that is evident upon weaning and precedes the onset of colitis. Intestines from A20dDC mice express increased amounts of Reg3β and Reg3γ, but not Ang4. A20 deficient DCs promote gut microbiota perturbation in the absence of adaptive lymphocytes. Moreover, A20 deficient DCs directly induce expression of Reg3β and Reg3γ but not Ang 4 in normal intestinal epithelial cell enteroid cultures in the absence of other cell types. These findings reveal a pathophysiological pathway in which defective expression of an IBD susceptibility gene in DCs drives aberrant expression of anti-bacterial peptides and luminal dysbiosis that in turn confers host susceptibility to intestinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2960770765,"According to some theoretical models, information contained in visual short-term memory (VSTM) consists of two main memory stages/storages: sensory memory, a system wherein information is stored for a brief time with high detail and low resistance to visual interference, and visual working memory, a low-capacity system wherein information is protected from visual interference and maintained for longer delays. Previous studies have consistently shown a strong relationship between attention and visual working memory. However, evidence is contradictory on whether or not attention modulates the construction and maintenance of visual representations in sensory memory. Here, we examined whether and how spatial attention differentially affects sensory and working memory contents, by separately analysing attentional costs and attentional benefits. Results showed that both sensory memory and visual working memory were reliably affected by the distribution of spatial attention, suggesting that spatial attention modulates the VSTM content starting from very early stages of memory storage. Moreover, endogenously attending a specific location led to similar performance in sensory and working memory, and therefore to larger attentional benefits in working memory (where there was more room for improvement than in sensory memory, because of worse performance in unattended locations). On the other hand, exogenous attentional capture by peripheral unpredictive cues produced invariant attentional costs and invariant attentional benefits regardless of the memory type, with performance being higher in sensory memory than in working memory even at the attended location."
https://openalex.org/W2958380116,"Binocular rivalry (BR) is a dynamic visual illusion that provides insight into the cortical mechanisms of visual awareness, stimulus selection, and object identification. When dissimilar binocular images cannot be fused, perception switches every few seconds between the left and right eye images. The speed at which individuals switch between alternatives is a stable, partially heritable trait. In order to isolate the monocular and binocular processes that determine the speed of rivalry, we presented stimuli tagged with a different flicker frequency in each eye and applied stimulus-phase locked MEG source imaging. We hypothesized that the strength of the evoked fundamental or intermodulation frequencies would vary when comparing Fast and Slow Switchers. Ten subjects reported perceptual alternations, with mean dominance durations between 1.2–4.0 sec. During BR, event-related monocular input in V1, and broadly in higher-tier ventral temporal cortex, waxed and waned with the periods of left or right eye dominance/suppression. In addition, we show that Slow Switchers produce greater evoked intermodulation frequency responses in a cortical network composed of V1, lateral occipital, posterior STS, retrosplenial & superior parietal cortices. Importantly, these dominance durations were not predictable from the brain responses to either of the fundamental tagging frequencies in isolation, nor from any responses to a pattern rivalry control condition, or a non-rivalrous control. The novel cortical network isolated, which overlaps with the default-mode network, may contain neurons that compute the level of endogenous monocular difference, and monitor accumulation of this conflict over extended periods of time. These findings are the first to relate the speed of rivalry across observers to the ‘efficient coding’ theory of computing binocular differences that may apply to binocular vision generally."
https://openalex.org/W2959664674,"Zooplankton plays a pivotal role in linking primary production to higher level consumers in the food webs of marine ecosystems. The distribution of zooplankton is affected by general water conditions, monsoons, currents, and spatial and temporal factors. In the Arctic Ocean, the sea surface is naturally covered with ice. Under ice, water masses interplay to create complex environments that facilitate the transport and distribution of zooplankton, thus altering community structures at geospatial and vertical scales. The present study investigated the species composition and copepod community structures by using geospatial and multiple depth scales, and using multivariate analyses to evaluate the relation of sampling stations and layers. During July–August 2010, zooplankton samples were collected and the temperature and salinity of seawater measured from three stations in the Canada Basin and two stations in the Makarov Basin of the Arctic Ocean (maximum distance of approximately 1400 km). A total of 55 copepod species (including 25 species that were solely identified to the generic level) and 7 taxa of copepodites, altogether belonging to 28 genera, 11 families, and 2 orders were identified, and significant differences were detected in copepod community structures among sampling strata and at geospatial scales. Numerically, Calanus hyperboreus, Calanus copepodite, Calanoida copepodite, Calanus glacialis, and Metridia longa were the most dominant species and taxa. At the local scale, copepod compositions responded differently at each of the sampling stations. At the geospatial scale, the distance between stations MS03 and ICE explained variations in the pattern of dominant species and of copepod community richness. Our study demonstrated varied spatial distribution which indicates that (1) the abundance of copepods at 0–200 m was significantly higher than at other strata, (2) vertical strata affected the distribution of copepod communities, and (3) the interplay of North Pacific and Atlantic waters shaping the copepod assemblage structure at geospatial scales in the Arctic Ocean. The results of our research provide base data for Arctic zooplankton biodiversity and biogeographic distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2959962522,"Objectives To analyse the internal consistency of an adaption of the methotrexate intolerance severity score (MISS); and to describe and compare the level of methotrexate intolerance evaluated by the MISS in Danish children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), treated with low-dose methotrexate (MTX). Methods Cross-sectional study of children diagnosed with JIA or ALL, treated with low-dose MTX, aged 9 years or above, and cognitively intact. The patient’s parents completed the MISS. MTX intolerance was defined as a total MISS score above 6. Results We enrolled 120 children with JIA and 23 children with ALL. The MISS had a good internal consistency in the JIA group. The median MISS score was higher in the JIA group than in the ALL group (JIA: 8; ALL: 1; p<0.0001); and the JIA group had a larger proportion of MTX intolerant children than the ALL group (JIA: 73/120; ALL: 4/23; p<0.001). Within both the JIA group and the ALL group, the MISS total score was not significantly correlated with age, MTX dose or the duration of low-dose MTX treatment. Conclusion In the JIA group the level of MTX intolerance was higher and more attributed to anticipatory, associative and behavioural symptoms than in the ALL group. The MISS may help to uncover whether MTX intolerance is present and which aspects are affected in the individual patient, thus guiding intervention. The MISS may also be applicable within leukaemia care."
https://openalex.org/W2956335890,"In this paper, a method was developed to assess the vertical response of piles considering crushing characteristics. A load transfer model of a pile is built and the relationship between the crushing characteristics and load transfer function of a pile was analyzed. Based on the analysis results, the transfer equation of load function considering the crushing characteristics was derived using the finite difference method. The ideal side resistance and the load transfer mechanism of a pile can be obtained by the transfer equation of load function. The predicted response of piles with the proposed method is in good agreement with the response observed in some pile tests reported in the literature. Further study was conducted to discuss the effect of the parameters related to the load transfer model considering crushing characteristics on the load-settlement response of a single pile."
https://openalex.org/W2959475264,"This paper is dedicated to the analysis of the improvement of heat transfer and the reduction of the pressure losses induced by the use of an active exchanger of millimeter size in a cooling loop. For pressure conditions imposed at the terminals of such a mini-channel whose upper wall is deformed by a progressive sinusoidal wave and for low Reynolds numbers (Re < 1000), we study the influence of the deformation parameters on the thermo-hydraulic performance of the exchanger (flow, heat transfer). The mechanical power applied to the deformed wall is connected to these parameters as well as to the pressure difference imposed by the external pump. The overall performance increases slightly with the value of the mechanical power up to a critical value for a given wall corrugation. Nevertheless, overall performance is up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than conventional static corrugated channels."
https://openalex.org/W2959714193,"Health disparities are commonplace and of broad interest to policy makers, but are also challenging to measure and communicate. The Health Disparity Calculator software (HD*Calc, v1.2.4) offers Monte Carlo simulation (MCS)-based confidence interval (CI) estimation of eleven disparity measures. The MCS approach provides accurate CI estimation, except when data are scarce (e.g., rare cancers). To address sparse data challenges to CI estimation, we propose two solutions: 1) employing the gamma distribution in the MCS and 2) utilizing a zero-inflated Poisson estimate for Poisson sampling in simulation experiments. We evaluate each solution through simulation studies using female breast, female brain, lung, and cervical cancer data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. We compare the coverage probabilities (CPs) of eleven health disparity measures based on simulated datasets. The truncated normal distribution implemented in the MCS with the standard Poisson samples (the default setting of HD*Calc) leads to less-than-optimal coverage probabilities (<95%). When both the gamma distribution and the estimated mean from the zero-inflated Poisson are used for the MCS, the coverage probabilities are close to the nominal level of 95%. Simulation studies also demonstrate that collapsing age categories for better CI estimation is not a pragmatic solution."
