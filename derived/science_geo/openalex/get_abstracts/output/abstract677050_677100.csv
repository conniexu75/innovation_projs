https://openalex.org/W3182054494,"Background Transgender and nonbinary people are disproportionately affected by structural barriers to quality healthcare, mental health challenges, and economic hardship. This study examined the impact of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis and subsequent control measures on gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability among transgender and nonbinary people in multiple countries. Methods We collected multi-national, cross-sectional data from 964 transgender and nonbinary adult users of the Hornet and Her apps from April to August 2020 to characterize changes in gender-affirming care, mental health, and economic stability as a result of COVID-19. We conducted Poisson regression models to assess if access to gender-affirming care and ability to live according to one’s gender were related to depressive symptoms, anxiety, and changes in suicidal ideation. Results Individuals resided in 76 countries, including Turkey (27.4%, n = 264) and Thailand (20.6%, n = 205). A majority were nonbinary (66.8%, n = 644) or transfeminine (29.4%, n = 283). Due to COVID-19, 55.0% (n = 320/582) reported reduced access to gender-affirming resources, and 38.0% (n = 327/860) reported reduced time lived according to their gender. About half screened positive for depression (50.4%,442/877) and anxiety (45.8%, n = 392/856). One in six (17.0%, n = 112/659) expected losses of health insurance, and 77.0% (n = 724/940) expected income reductions. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and increased suicidal ideation were 1.63 (95% CI: 1.36–1.97), 1.61 (95% CI: 1.31–1.97), and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.07–2.82) times higher for individuals whose access to gender-affirming resources was reduced versus not. Discussion The COVID-19 crisis is associated with reduced access to gender-affirming resources and the ability of transgender and nonbinary people to live according to their gender worldwide. These reductions may drive the increased depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal ideation reported in this sample. To improve health of transgender and nonbinary communities, increased access to gender-affirming resources should be prioritized through policies (e.g., digital prescriptions), flexible interventions (e.g., telehealth), and support for existing transgender health initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W3181032299,"This study evaluates the nexus of regional integration, socioeconomic determinants and sustainable development (SD) by investigating the effect of health, humans and age structure on sustainable development, with the regional integration (RI) as the moderating variable. Socioeconomic determinants have an important role in sustainable development, while regional integration has fueled up the development process. The sample is based on 64 Belt and Road (BRI) countries from 2003–2018. Pair-wise correlation results indicate that human development, health expenditure and age structure showed a positive relationship with sustainable development. Two-step System-GMM direct effect outcomes are mixed and reveal that human development, health expenditure per capita, age structure, governance index and population size have a positive impact on sustainable development. On the other hand, e-government, government size, and globalization showed negative effects on SD. Apart from that, the moderating channel of regional integration (RI), interaction term with human development and health expenditure, showed a significant and positive impact on sustainable development. However, age structure interaction with regional integration showed a negative impact on SD. Other socio-economic factors, i.e., governance index and population contribute positively towards SD. It can be concluded that the dynamic nature of sustainable development is positive and the net present value is increasing. Therefore, BRI countries are on the sustainable path from 2003–2018, as suggested by economic and social welfare theory. The integration of BRI can be labeled as an entrance to successful sustainable development. However, weak e-government systems, globalization and government resources need to be utilized amicably in Belt and Road countries. Driscoll-Kraay standard-errors regression confirmed and validated the two-step System-GMM results. The findings of the current research have important policy implications for balanced and sustainable growth."
https://openalex.org/W3178778073,"To those involved in discussions about rigor, reproducibility, and replication in science, conversation about the “reproducibility crisis” appear ill-structured. Seemingly very different issues concerning the purity of reagents, accessibility of computational code, or misaligned incentives in academic research writ large are all collected up under this label. Prior work has attempted to address this problem by creating analytical definitions of reproducibility. We take a novel empirical, mixed methods approach to understanding variation in reproducibility discussions, using a combination of grounded theory and correspondence analysis to examine how a variety of authors narrate the story of the reproducibility crisis. Contrary to expectations, this analysis demonstrates that there is a clear thematic core to reproducibility discussions, centered on the incentive structure of science, the transparency of methods and data, and the need to reform academic publishing. However, we also identify three clusters of discussion that are distinct from the main body of articles: one focused on reagents, another on statistical methods, and a final cluster focused on the heterogeneity of the natural world. Although there are discursive differences between scientific and popular articles, we find no strong differences in how scientists and journalists write about the reproducibility crisis. Our findings demonstrate the value of using qualitative methods to identify the bounds and features of reproducibility discourse, and identify distinct vocabularies and constituencies that reformers should engage with to promote change."
https://openalex.org/W3178193710,"Background Previous research studies have demonstrated a relationship between low levels of physical activity and high amounts of screen time in children and adolescents. However, this is usually based on self-reported data. Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between objectively measured smartphone screen time and physical activity among children and adolescents aged 10–15 years. Methods During seven consecutive days, we objectively assessed smartphone screen time, using the SCRIIN smartphone application, and physical activity, using the SCRIIN activity tracker, in children and adolescents recruited from two schools in Stockholm County, Sweden. Moreover, the children/adolescents and their parents responded to a questionnaire, obtaining among other things: self-reported screen time, physical activity, sleep and health-related quality of life. Results A total of 121 children and adolescents (mean age: 12.1 ± 1.5) were included in the study. Objectively measured smartphone screen time was 161.2 ± 81.1 min/day. Mean physical activity, measured with the SCRIIN activity tracker, was 32.6 ± 16.5 active min/day. Minutes of screen time and physical activity did not differ between the children and adolescents from the two schools, despite located in different socioeconomic areas. Further, we found no association between smartphone screen time and physical activity. However, girls aged 14–15 years, had more smartphone screen time (p&lt;0.01) and were significantly more physically active (p&lt;0.01) than girls aged 10–12 years. In addition, boys reported more than five times more time spent on computer and video games than girls did. Conclusion Smartphone screen time was not associated with physical activity level among children and adolescents aged 10–15 years."
https://openalex.org/W3182971338,"In current clinical settings, typically pain is measured by a patient’s self-reported information. This subjective pain assessment results in suboptimal treatment plans, over-prescription of opioids, and drug-seeking behavior among patients. In the present study, we explored automatic objective pain intensity estimation machine learning models using inputs from physiological sensors. This study uses BioVid Heat Pain Dataset. We extracted features from Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electromyogram (EMG) signals collected from study participants subjected to heat pain. We built different machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Neural Networks and Extreme Gradient Boosting for continuous value pain intensity estimation. Then we identified the physiological sensor, feature set and machine learning model that give the best predictive performance. We found that EDA is the most information-rich sensor for continuous pain intensity prediction. A set of only 3 features from EDA signals using SVR model gave an average performance of 0.93 mean absolute error (MAE) and 1.16 root means square error (RMSE) for the subject-independent model and of 0.92 MAE and 1.13 RMSE for subject-dependent. The MAE achieved with signal-feature-model combination is less than 1 unit on 0 to 4 continues pain scale, which is smaller than the MAE achieved by the methods reported in the literature. These results demonstrate that it is possible to estimate pain intensity of a patient using a computationally inexpensive machine learning model with 3 statistical features from EDA signal which can be collected from a wrist biosensor. This method paves a way to developing a wearable pain measurement device."
https://openalex.org/W3180052893,"Listening to speech in noise is effortful for individuals with hearing loss, even if they have received a hearing prosthesis such as a hearing aid or cochlear implant (CI). At present, little is known about the neural functions that support listening effort. One form of neural activity that has been suggested to reflect listening effort is the power of 8–12 Hz (alpha) oscillations measured by electroencephalography (EEG). Alpha power in two cortical regions has been associated with effortful listening—left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and parietal cortex—but these relationships have not been examined in the same listeners. Further, there are few studies available investigating neural correlates of effort in the individuals with cochlear implants. Here we tested 16 CI users in a novel effort-focused speech-in-noise listening paradigm, and confirm a relationship between alpha power and self-reported effort ratings in parietal regions, but not left IFG. The parietal relationship was not linear but quadratic, with alpha power comparatively lower when effort ratings were at the top and bottom of the effort scale, and higher when effort ratings were in the middle of the scale. Results are discussed in terms of cognitive systems that are engaged in difficult listening situations, and the implication for clinical translation."
https://openalex.org/W3178008869,"Background In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, incoming travelers were quarantined at specific centers in Nepal and major checkpoints in Nepal-India border. Nepal adopted a generic public health approaches to control and quarantine returnee migrants, with little attention towards the quality of quarantine facilities and its aftermath, such as the poor mental health of the returnee migrants. The main objective of this study was to explore the status of anxiety and depression, and factors affecting them among returnee migrants living in institutional quarantine centers of western Nepal. Methods A mixed method approach in this study included a quantitative survey and in-depth interviews (IDIs) among respondents in quarantine centers of Karnali province between 21 st April and 15 th May 2020. Survey questionnaire utilized Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) tools, which were administered among 441 quarantined returnee migrants. IDIs were conducted among 12 participants which included a mix of six quarantined migrants and healthcare workers each from the quarantine centres. Descriptive and inferential analyses were conducted on quantitative data; and thematic analysis was utilized for qualitative data. Results Mild depression (9.1%; 40/441) and anxiety (16.1%; 71/441) was common among respondents followed by moderate depression and anxiety {depression (3.4%; 15/441), anxiety (4.1%; 18/441)} and severe depression and anxiety {depression (1.1%; 5/441), anxiety (0.7%; 3/441)}. Anxiety and depression were independent of their socio-demographic characteristics. Perceived fear of contracting COVID-19, severity and death were prominent among the respondents. Respondents experienced stigma and discrimination in addition to being at the risk of disease and possible loss of employment and financial responsibilities. In addition, poor (quality and access to) health services, and poor living condition at the quarantine centres adversely affected respondents’ mental health. Conclusion Depression and anxiety were high among quarantined population and warrants more research. Institutional quarantine centers of Karnali province of Nepal were in poor conditions which adversely impacted mental health of the respondents. Poor resource allocation for health, hygiene and living conditions can be counterproductive to the population quarantined."
https://openalex.org/W3183060136,"Salinity is one of the main abiotic stresses limiting crop productivity. In the current study, the transcriptome of wheat leaves in an Iranian salt-tolerant cultivar (Arg) was investigated in response to salinity stress to identify salinity stress-responsive genes and mechanisms. More than 114 million reads were generated from leaf tissues by the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. An amount of 81.9% to 85.7% of reads could be mapped to the wheat reference genome for different samples. The data analysis led to the identification of 98819 genes, including 26700 novel transcripts. A total of 4290 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were recognized, comprising 2346 up-regulated genes and 1944 down-regulated genes. Clustering of the DEGs utilizing Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) indicated that transcripts associated with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, transporters, transcription factors, hormone signal transduction, glycosyltransferases, exosome, and MAPK signaling might be involved in salt tolerance. The expression patterns of nine DEGs were investigated by quantitative real-time PCR in Arg and Moghan3 as the salt-tolerant and susceptible cultivars, respectively. The obtained results were consistent with changes in transcript abundance found by RNA-sequencing in the tolerant cultivar. The results presented here could be utilized for salt tolerance enhancement in wheat through genetic engineering or molecular breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3180327395,"Sepsis and septic shock are key contributors to mortality in critically ill patients and thus prompt recognition and management thereof is central to achieving improved patient outcomes. Early initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy constitutes a crucial component of the management strategy and thus early identification of the causative pathogen is essential in informing antimicrobial therapeutic choices. The BioFire FilmArray blood culture identification (BCID) panel is a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rapid, multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for use on positive blood cultures. This study evaluated its clinical utility in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting, in terms of amendment of empiric antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients with sepsis. The assay proved useful in this setting as final results were made available to clinicians significantly earlier than with conventional culture methods. This, in turn, allowed for modification of empirical antimicrobial therapy to more appropriate agents in 32% of patients. Additionally, the use of the BioFire FilmArray BCID panel permitted the prompt implementation of additional infection prevention and control practices in a sizeable proportion (14%) of patients in the study who were harbouring multidrug resistant pathogens. These findings support the use of the BioFire FilmArray BCID panel as a valuable adjunct to conventional culture methods for the diagnosis and subsequent management of critically ill patients with sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W3180113260,"Maize is a cold sensitive crop that exhibits severe retardation of growth and development when exposed to cold spells during and right after germination, including the slowdown in development of new leaves and in formation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Improving cold tolerance in maize would allow early sowing to improve crop yield by prolonging a growing season and by decreasing the negative effects of summer drought, diseases, and pests. Two maize inbreds widely incorporated into American maize germplasm, B73 and Mo17, exhibit different levels of tolerance to low temperature exposure at seedling stage. In addition, thirty seven diverse inbred maize lines showed large variation for seedling response to low temperature exposure with lines with extremely low tolerance to seedling exposure to low temperatures falling into stiff stalk, non-stiff stalk, and tropical clades. We employed the maize intermated B73×Mo17 (IBM) recombinant inbred line population (IBM Syn4 RIL) to investigate the genetic architecture of cold stress tolerance at a young seedling stage and to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling this variation. A panel of 97 recombinant inbred lines of IBM Syn4 were used to measure, and score based on several traits related to chlorophyll concentration, leaf color, and tissue damage. Our analysis resulted in detection of two QTLs with high additive impact, one on chromosome 1 (bin 1.02) and second on chromosome 5 (bin 5.05). Further investigation of the QTL regions using gene expression data provided a list of the candidate genes likely contributing to the variation in cold stress response. Among the genes located within QTL regions identified in this study and differentially expressed in response to low temperature exposure are the genes with putative functions related to auxin and gibberellin response, as well as general abiotic stress response, and genes coding for proteins with broad regulatory functions."
https://openalex.org/W3180630130,"Sea-level rise resulting from climate change is impacting coasts around the planet. There is strong scientific consensus about the amount of sea-level rise to 2050 (0.24–0.32 m) and a range of projections to 2100, which vary depending on the approach used and the mitigation measures taken to reduce carbon emissions. Despite this strong scientific consensus regarding the reality of climate change-related sea-level rise, and the associated need to engage publics in adaptation and mitigation efforts, there is a lack of empirical evidence regarding people’s understanding of the issue. Here we investigate public understanding of the amount, rate and causes of sea-level rise. Data from a representative sample of New Zealand adults showed a suprising tendency for the public to overestimate the scientifically plausible amount of sea-level rise by 2100 and to identify melting sea ice as its primary causal mechanism. These findings will be valuable for scientists communicating about sea-level rise, communicators seeking to engage publics on the issue of sea-level rise, and media reporting on sea-level rise."
https://openalex.org/W3182281250,"Background Research suggests that being exposed to the suicide of others increases risk of subsequent suicidal or self-harming thoughts or behaviours. What is less clear is whether this applies to adolescents, and if the risk exceeds that following other causes of death, which has implications on suicide prevention approaches. This study aimed to systematically review the evidence on adolescent bereavement experiences by different causes to address this gap. Methods A comprehensive literature search using four databases (MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Embase) identified 21 studies which measured suicidal or self-harm outcomes among bereaved adolescents aged between 12 to 18 years old. The literature was screened, data was extracted using pre-piloted forms, and risk of bias was assessed using versions of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale; a proportion of papers were double extracted and assessed for bias. The review has been registered with PROSPERO (CRD42016051125). Results A narrative synthesis of the literature demonstrated divergent findings depending on the outcome being measured. Suicide bereavement appears to be strongly associated with suicide mortality among parentally bereaved youth, while self-harm or non-fatal suicide attempts (either presenting to hospital or self-reported) showed mixed evidence. Suicidal ideation was not uniquely associated with suicide bereavement. An exploration of circumstances surrounding the death, characteristics of the person who died, and characteristics of the young person across each outcome measure suggested that earlier experiences of loss, shorter timeframes following the death, and maternal death are associated with particularly elevated risk of suicidal outcomes. Conclusions Findings suggest that suicide loss is associated with subsequent suicide, and may be associated with non-fatal self-harm. A detailed account of the risk and protective factors surrounding suicide bereavement among young people is crucial to understand the pathways through which suicidal behaviours develop. Researchers, policy makers and practitioners with an interest in suicide prevention will benefit from clarity around the needs of young bereaved individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3179735622,"The large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance are the key factor affecting fine-grained image classification. Recently, some algorithms have been more accurate and efficient. However, these methods ignore the multi-scale information of the network, resulting in insufficient ability to capture subtle changes. To solve this problem, a weakly supervised fine-grained classification network based on multi-scale pyramid is proposed in this paper. It uses pyramid convolution kernel to replace ordinary convolution kernel in residual network, which can expand the receptive field of the convolution kernel and use complementary information of different scales. Meanwhile, the weakly supervised data augmentation network (WS-DAN) is used to prevent over fitting and improve the performance of the model. In addition, a new attention module, which includes spatial attention and channel attention, is introduced to pay more attention to the object part in the image. The comprehensive experiments are carried out on three public benchmarks. It shows that the proposed method can extract subtle feature and achieve classification effectively."
https://openalex.org/W3178366135,"Ayapana triplinervis is a plant species used in traditional medicine and in mystical-religious rituals by traditional communities in the Amazon. The aim of this study are to develop a nano-emulsion containing essential oil from A . triplinervis morphotypes, to evaluate larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti and acute oral toxicity in Swiss albino mice ( Mus musculus ). The essential oils were extracted by steam dragging, identified by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and nano-emulsions were prepared using the low energy method. Phytochemical analyses indicated the major compounds, expressed as area percentage, β-Caryophyllene (45.93%) and Thymohydroquinone Dimethyl Ether (32.93%) in morphotype A; and Thymohydroquinone Dimethyl Ether (84.53%) was found in morphotype B. Morphotype A essential oil nano-emulsion showed a particle size of 101.400 ± 0.971 nm (polydispersity index = 0.124 ± 0.009 and zeta potential = -19.300 ± 0.787 mV). Morphotype B essential oil nano-emulsion had a particle size of 104.567 ± 0.416 nm (polydispersity index = 0.168 ± 0.016 and zeta potential = -27.700 ± 1.307 mV). Histomorphological analyses showed the presence of inflammatory cells in the liver of animals treated with morphotype A essential oil nano-emulsion (MAEON) and morphotype B essential oil nano-emulsion (MBEON). Congestion and the presence of transudate with leukocyte infiltration in the lung of animals treated with MAEON were observed. The nano-emulsions containing essential oils of A . triplinervis morphotypes showed an effective nanobiotechnological product in the chemical control of A . aegypti larvae with minimal toxicological action for non-target mammals."
https://openalex.org/W3178309446,"Rice cultivation usually involves high water and fertilizer application rates leading to the nonpoint pollution of surface waters with phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). Here, a 10-year field experiment was conducted to investigate N and P losses and their impact factors under different irrigation and fertilization regimes. Results indicated that T2 (Chemical fertilizer of 240 kg N ha −1 , 52 kg P ha −1 , and 198 kg K ha −1 combined with shallow intermittent irrigation) decreased N loss by 48.9% compared with T1 (Chemical fertilizer of 273 kg N ha −1 , 59 kg P ha −1 , and 112 kg K ha −1 combined with traditional flooding irrigation). The loss ratio (total N loss loading/amount of applied N) of N was 9.24–15.90%, whereas that of P was 1.13–1.31% in all treatments. Nitrate N (NO 3 - −N) loss was the major proportion accounting for 88.30–90.65% of dissolved inorganic N loss through surface runoff. Moreover, the N runoff loss was mainly due to high fertilizer input, soil NO 3 - −N, and ammonium N (NH 4 + −N) contents. In addition, the N loss was accelerated by Bacteroidetes , Proteobacteria , Planotomycetes , Nitrospirae , Firmicutes bacteria and Ascomycota fungi, but decreased by Chytridiomycota fungi whose contribution to the N transformation process. Furthermore, T2 increased agronomic N use efficiency (AEN) and rice yield by 32.81% and 7.36%, respectively, in comparison with T1. These findings demonstrated that T2 might be an effective approach to ameliorate soil chemical properties, regulate microbial community structure, increase AEN and consequently reduce N losses as well as maintaining rice yields in the present study."
https://openalex.org/W3179872271,"Banana is a staple food and a major export commodity in the tropics. However, banana production systems are affected by the plant-soil relationships, where properties such as quality and quantity of soil organic matter play an important role in the dynamics of soil physical properties. In order to evaluate the effect of the soil organic carbon (SOC) content and its distribution in the water-stable of soil aggregates (WAS), and the physical fractions of the macro-organic matter, a study was conducted in lacustrine soils under Banana cv. ʻGrand Nainʼ in Venezuela. Soil sampling was carried out in two batches differentiated by their textural class and crop production. A completely randomized design under a directed random sampling technique was carried out. In each condition, 12 composite samples were taken at depths 0–5 and 5–10 cm, respectively. WAS were separated into micro (&lt; 250 μm) and macroaggregates (&gt; 250 μm). Also, physical fractionation by size-density of the macro-organic matter into light (LF), intermediate (IF), and heavy (HF) fraction using a silica gel solution, and SOC, were determined and correlated with banana yield and other agronomic traits. A major proportion of aggregates &gt; 250 μm were found in both conditions and depths. Organic Carbon within soil aggregates ranged between 29.7 and 35.3 g kg -1 . The HF was superior to IF and LF; however, its C content was higher in the LF. The results allow inferring that the stability conferred to these soils is primarily associated with the presence of the snail, which shares the same size as the aggregates studied. High yields are associated with high C content in stable aggregates, as well as in the most labile fractions of macro-organic matter. These results highlight the importance of the use of organic fertilizers less recalcitrant as a strategy for sustainable management of banana cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W3180144928,"The agaves are plants of cultural importance which have been used by humans for about 10,000 years and about 40 specific uses. The most culturally and economically important of those uses are for the production of fermented (pulque) and distilled beverages (mescal). Pulque continues to be produced in nearly all of Mexico, and the agaves used for this purpose have shown domestication syndrome. We carry out an ethnobotanical, morphological, and genetic analysis of the traditional varieties of pulque agave used in the production of aguamiel (agave sap) and pulque in the state of Hidalgo. We did semi-structured interviews, free listings, and tours with 11 agave managers. We analyzed morphology and studied genetic diversity and structure using nuclear microsatellites. We found wild-collected, tolerated, transplanted, and cultivated varieties of agave. This comprised 19 traditional varieties of pulque agave, 12 of them in production during the study, which corresponded to the species Agave americana , A . salmiana y A . mapisaga and five intraspecific entities. The varieties were grouped morphologically according to a management gradient; the wild-collected varieties were the smallest, with more lateral teeth and a larger terminal spine. The cultivated varieties clearly exhibited domestication syndrome, with larger plants and smaller dentition. The expected heterozygosity (He) of the varieties ranged from 0.204 to 0.721. Bayesian clustering suggested the existence of three genetic groups, both at the level of traditional varieties of pulque agaves and for management categories, a result that matches multivariate clustering. Pulque producers in the studied localities maintain high agrobiodiversity. The cultivated varieties exhibit domestication syndrome, as has been reported for other species of the genus with the same selection purposes. Our results support the hypothesis of a decrease in genetic diversity in crops compared to wild-growing agaves, which seems to be due to vegetative propagation, among other factors."
https://openalex.org/W3180825328,"Background and objectives Nurses’ caring behaviors, professional activities, and behaviors for the benefit of patients, influence patients’ perception of care and satisfaction with the quality of care provided. Caring behaviors of nurses are contextual and various factors such as patients’ social structure, lifestyle, culture, and interests, as well as their biographical, social, and physiological characteristics, can influence perceptions of caring behaviors of nurses, as caring behaviors are an interactive and mental process between patients and nurses. This study was conducted to provide a transcultural translation and psychometric analysis of Caring Behaviors Inventory (CBI) among nurses in Iran. Methodology Transcultural translation of the 16-item CBI was performed. Then, face validity (qualitative), content validity (quantitative and qualitative), and construct validity were examined in a cross-sectional study of 509 patients. A demographic questionnaire and the 16-item CBI were sent to enrolled patients via online questionnaires. The reliability of the instrument was assessed by internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha. Then, construct validity of the single factor CBI was assessed using Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Since one factor CBI was not confirmed, construct validity was examined using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). The final number of factors was confirmed using CFA. Results The internal consistency of the instrument was good with Cronbach’s alpha 0.89. Based on EFA, the CBI were loaded on two factors, eigenvalues &gt;1, no item was removed. The emergent factors were named ""Communicating respectfully"" and ""Professional knowledge and skill"". These two factors explained 50.197% of the total variance. Then, CFA showed an acceptable fit for the two factors CBI. Conclusion The results showed that the Persian version of the 16-item CBI had adequate validity and reliability. Accordingly, this instrument can be used to study nurses’ caring behaviors."

https://openalex.org/W3112562283,"Background Aerosolization of respiratory droplets is considered the main route of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, reducing the viral load of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shed via respiratory droplets is potentially an ideal strategy to prevent the spread of the pandemic. The in vitro virucidal activity of intranasal Povidone-Iodine (PVP-I) has been demonstrated recently to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral titres. This study evaluated the virucidal activity of the aqueous solution of Iodine-V (a clathrate complex formed by elemental iodine and fulvic acid) as in Essential Iodine Drops (EID) with 200 μg elemental iodine/ml content against SARS-CoV-2 to ascertain whether it is a better alternative to PVP-I. Methods SARS-CoV-2 (USAWA1/2020 strain) virus stock was prepared by infecting Vero 76 cells (ATCC CRL-1587) until cytopathic effect (CPE). The virucidal activity of EID against SARS-CoV-2 was tested in three dilutions (1:1; 2:1 and 3:1) in triplicates by incubating at room temperature (22 ± 2°C) for either 60 or 90 seconds. The surviving viruses from each sample were quantified by a standard end-point dilution assay. Results EID (200 μg iodine/ml) after exposure for 60 and 90 seconds was compared to controls. In both cases, the viral titre was reduced by 99% (LRV 2.0). The 1:1 dilution of EID with virus reduced SARS-CoV-2 virus from 31,623 cell culture infectious dose 50% (CCID 50 ) to 316 CCID 50 within 90 seconds. Conclusion Substantial reductions in LRV by Iodine-V in EID confirmed the activity of EID against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, demonstrating that Iodine-V in EID is effective at inactivating the virus in vitro and therefore suggesting its potential application intranasally to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission from known or suspected COVID-19 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3178776638,"As the amounts of data and use of distributed systems for data storage and processing have increased, reducing the number of replications has turned into a crucial requirement in these systems, which has been addressed by plenty of research. In this paper, an algorithm has been proposed to reduce the number of replications in big data transfer and, eventually to lower the traffic load over the grid by classifying data efficiently and optimally based on the sent data types and using VIKOR as a method of multivariate decision-making for ranking replication sites. Considering different variables, the VIKOR method makes it possible to take all the parameters effective in the assessment of site ranks into account. According to the results and evaluations, the proposed method has exhibited an improvement by about thirty percent in average over the LRU, LFU, BHR, and Without Rep. algorithms. Furthermore, it has improved the existing multivariate methods through different approaches to replication by thirty percent, as it considers effective parameters such as time, the number of replications, and replication site, causing replication to occur when it can make an improvement in terms of access."

Data was collected between August 2019 and March 2020. Total sample included 43,167 individuals aged ≥15 years who had at least one dental appointment in the last 12 months before interview. Study outcome was ‘public dental service utilisation’, and Andersen’s behavioral model was adopted for selecting independent variables. A multilevel analysis was performed using individual factors as first level and federation units as second level. Results The highest prevalence of public dental service utilisation on an individual level was observed among unable to read or write people (PR: 3.31; p&lt;0.001), indigenous (PR: 1.40; p&lt;0.001), black or brown (PR: 1.16; p&lt;0.001), with per capita household income of up to U$124 (PR: 2.40; p&lt;0.001), living in the rural area (PR: 1.28; p&lt;0.001), and who self-rated oral health as regular (PR: 1.15; p&lt;0.001) or very bad/bad (PR: 1.26; p&lt;0.001). On the contextual level, highest PR of public dental service utilisation was observed among those living in federal units with increased oral health coverage in primary health care. Conclusions Public dental service utilisation is associated with individual and contextual factors. These results can guide decision-making based on evidence from policymakers, demonstrating the potential for mitigating oral health inequalities and increasing service coverage in a public and universal health system."
https://openalex.org/W3179305932,"Manual dissection and histologic examination are commonly used to investigate human structures, but there are limitations in the damage caused to delicate structures or the provision of limited information. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) enables a three-dimensional volume-rendered observation of the sample without destruction and deformation, but it can only visualize hard tissues in general. Therefore, contrast-enhancing agents are needed to help in visualizing soft tissue. This study aimed to introduce microCT with phosphotungstic acid preparation (PTA-microCT) by applying the method to different types of human tissue. Specimens from human cadavers were used to examine the orbicularis retaining ligament (ORL), nasolabial fold (NLF), and the calcaneal tunnel of the sole. Using PTA-microCT, relevant information of human structures was identified. In the ORL study, tiny and delicate ligamentous fibers were visualized in detail with multidirectional continuity. In the NLF study, complex structural formation consisting of various types of soft tissue were investigated comprehensively. In the calcaneal tunnel study, the space surrounded by diverse features and its inner vulnerable structures were examined without damage. Consequently, we successfully applied the PTA-microCT technique to the analysis of specific human soft tissue structures that are challenging to analyze by conventional methods."
https://openalex.org/W3179413926,"Background &amp; aims HCV CD4+ and CD8+ specific T cells responses are functionally impaired during chronic hepatitis C infection. DAAs therapies eradicate HCV infection in more than 95% of treated patients. However, the impact of HCV elimination on immune responses remain controversial. Here, we aimed to investigate whether HCV cure by DAAs could reverse the impaired immune response to HCV. Methods We analyzed 27 chronic HCV infected patients undergoing DAA treatment in tertiary care hospital, and we determined the phenotypical and functional changes in both HCV CD8+ and CD4+ specific T-cells before and after viral clearance. PD-1, TIM-3 and LAG-3 cell-surface expression was assessed by flow cytometry to determine CD4+ T cell exhaustion. Functional responses to HCV were analyzed by IFN-Ɣ ELISPOT, intracellular cytokine staining (IL-2 and IFN-Ɣ) and CFSE-based proliferation assays. Results We observed a significant decrease in the expression of PD-1 in CD4+ T-cells after 12 weeks of viral clearance in non-cirrhotic patients (p = 0.033) and in treatment-naive patients (p = 0.010), indicating a partial CD4 phenotype restoration. IFN-Ɣ and IL-2 cytokines production by HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells remained impaired upon HCV eradication. Finally, a significant increase of the proliferation capacity of both HCV CD4+ and CD8+ specific T-cells was observed after HCV elimination by DAAs therapies. Conclusions Our results show that in chronically infected patients HCV elimination by DAA treatment lead to partial reversion of CD4+ T cell exhaustion. Moreover, proliferative capacity of HCV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells is recovered after DAA’s therapies."

In order to ensure the smooth development of the NIMBY facility PPP projects, the problem of choosing the most suitable operation mode among many PPP modes is still scarce and unscientific. In order to select the operation mode of the PPP projects that best fits the characteristics of the project, this paper constructs the operation mode selection of the NIMBY facility PPP project. Firstly, the index system of operation mode selection of the NIMBY facility PPP project is determined. G1 subjective weighting method and information entropy objective weighting method are introduced to solve the optimal weight of each index. Grey correlation theory is used to improve TOPSIS method, and the calculation form of relative proximity degree is optimized to determine the most suitable operation mode for the project. In this paper, combined weighting and TOPSIS method are applied to the research of NIMBY facility PPP project, and the operation mode selection of NIMBY facility PPP project is established, which makes up the blank of this part. Finally, a PPP project in Qingdao, Shandong Province, China, is taken as an example to verify the applicability of the model. The effectiveness of this model was tested by comparing the results of TOPSIS method, Grey target model, Extended matter-element mode and GRA-TOPSIS. It is hoped to provide useful reference for the operation mode selection of NIMBY facility PPP project."
https://openalex.org/W3178371503,"Aim Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is an increasingly recognized cause of heart failure (HF) with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), typically presenting as restrictive cardiomyopathy. The potential co-existence of ATTR-CA with systolic heart failure has not been studied. The aim of this study is to describe the prevalence of ATTR-CA and its clinical characteristics in HF patients with reduced LVEF. Methods Patients with an unexplained cause of LV systolic dysfunction were screened for ATTR-CA by a 99m Tc-PYP planar scintigraphy. Patients in whom presence of ≥ 2 uptake was confirmed by SPECT imaging were included. Their clinical, laboratory and echocardiographic data were collected. Results Out of 75 patients (mean age 65±12 years, LVEF 35.8±7.9%) included in this study, 7 (9.3%) patients (mean age 75±6 years, LVEF 32.0±8.3%) had ATTR-CA. Patients with ATTR-CA were more symptomatic at diagnosis (NYHA FC 3–4 (86% vs 35% (p = 0.03)) and had a more severe clinical course evident by recurrent hospitalizations for HF, and a need for intravenous diuretic treatment (p = 0.04 and p&lt;0.01, respectively) at follow-up, compared with patients with no ATTR-CA. Patients with ATTR-CA had similar LVEF but a clear trend for larger LV mass index (157.1±60.6 g/m 2 vs. 121.0±39.5 g/m 2 , p = 0.07) and a larger proportions of ATTR-CA patients had IVS thickness &gt;13 mm (57.1% vs 13.1%, p = 0.02) as compared to HF patients with no ATTR-CA. Conclusion In our study, a meaningful percentage of patients with unexplained LV dysfunction had a co-existing ATTR-CA indicating that the clinical heterogeneity of ATTR-CA is much broader than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W3178476829,"The zona pellucida (ZP) is a transparent envelope that surrounds the mammalian oocyte and mediates species-selective sperm–oocyte interactions. The bovine ZP consists of the glycoproteins ZP2, ZP3, and ZP4. Sperm-binding mechanisms of the bovine ZP are not yet fully elucidated. In a previous report, we established the expression system of bovine ZP glycoproteins using Sf9 insect cells and found that the ZP3/ZP4 heterocomplex inhibits the binding of sperm to the ZP in a competitive inhibition assay, while ZP2, ZP3, ZP4, the ZP2/ZP3 complex, and the ZP2/ZP4 complex do not exhibit this activity. Here, we show that bovine sperm binds to plastic plates coated with ZP4 in the absence of ZP3. We made a series of ZP4 deletion mutants to study the sperm-binding sites. The N-terminal region, Lys-25 to Asp-136, and the middle region, Ser-290 to Lys-340, of ZP4 exhibit sperm-binding activity. These results suggest that among the three components of bovine ZP glycoproteins, ZP4 contains the major potential sperm-binding sites, and the formation of a multivalent complex is necessary for the sperm-binding activity of ZP4."
https://openalex.org/W3178522840,"Magnetic particle tracking is a recently developed technology that can measure the translation and rotation of a particle in an opaque environment like a turbidity flow and fluidized-bed flow. The trajectory reconstruction usually relies on numerical optimization or filtering, which involve artificial parameters or thresholds. Existing analytical reconstruction algorithms have certain limitations and usually depend on the gradient of the magnetic field, which is not easy to measure accurately in many applications. This paper discusses a new semi-analytical solution and the related reconstruction algorithm. The new method can be used for an arbitrary sensor arrangement. To reduce the measurement uncertainty in practical applications, deep neural network (DNN)-based models are developed to denoise the reconstructed trajectory. Compared to traditional approaches such as wavelet-based filtering, the DNN-based denoisers are more accurate in the position reconstruction. However, they often over-smooth the velocity signal, and a hybrid method that combines the wavelet and DNN model provides a more accurate velocity reconstruction. All the DNN-based and wavelet methods perform well in the orientation reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W3181852597,"The objective of this study was to determine whether maternal or paternal ages have any impact on the prenatal incidence of genomic copy number variants (CNV) in fetuses with structural anomalies. We conducted a non-paired case-control study (1:2 ratio) among pregnancies undergoing chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) because of fetal ultrasound anomalies, from December 2012 to May 2020. Pregnancies with any pathogenic copy number variant (CNV), either microdeletion or microduplication, were defined as cases. Controls were selected as the next two pregnancies with the same indication for CMA but with a normal result. Logistic regression was used, adjusting by use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) and parental smoking. Stratified analysis was performed according to CNV type (de novo/inherited and recurrent/non-recurrent). The study included 189 pregnancies: 63 cases and 126 controls. Mean maternal age in cases was 33.1 (SD 4.6) years and 33.9 (SD 6.0) years in controls. Mean paternal mean age was 34.5 (SD 4.8) years in cases and 35.8 (SD 5.8) years in controls. No significant differences in maternal or paternal age were observed, neither in stratified analysis according to the CNV type. Moreover, the proportion of cases were not significantly different between non-advanced and advanced ages, either considering paternal or maternal ages. The presence of pathogenic CNV at CMA in fetuses with structural anomalies was not found to be associated with advanced paternal or maternal age."
https://openalex.org/W3178467103,"Forests play an important role in the global carbon (C) balance, but their biomass has decreased globally mainly because of deforestation and a reduction in forest cover. However, little is known about the C stock of tree biomass related to environmental factors in the remnant forest patches. Thus, the present study aimed at assessing the status of C stocks of tree biomass using an allometric equation in Kibate Forest (Ethiopia). Sixty–six plots (30×30 m) were laid out at 100 m interval distance along the altitudinal gradients in five transects. The results revealed that the highest C stocks (67.4%) per species were contributed by Juniperus procera , Ilex mitis var. mitis , Nuxia congesta , and Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata . The mean total tree biomass was 91.9 ± 10.01 Mg ha −1 . The mean total C stock was 45.9 ± 5.17 Mg ha −1 , out of which 38.3 ± 4.31 and 7.7 ± 0.91 Mg ha −1 were stored in above- and belowground C pools, respectively. Anthropogenic factors were negatively associated with the C-stock distribution in the study area. Thus, the status of the C stock of tree biomass related to anthropogenic factors indicates that sustainable forest management practice is needed in the study area to conserve biodiversity and mitigate climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3179532247,"Individuals with autistic traits display impaired social interaction and communication in everyday life, but the underlying cognitive neural mechanisms remain very unclear and still remain controversial. The mind-blindness hypothesis suggests that social difficulties in individuals with autistic traits are caused by empathy impairment in individuals; however, the intense world theory suggests that these social difficulties are caused by sensory hyper-reactivity and sensory overload, rather than empathy impairment. To further test these two theories, this study investigated event-related potentials (ERPs) to explore the cognitive neural processing of repetitive expressions in individuals with autistic traits. This study employed the Mandarin version of the autism-spectrum quotient (AQ) to assess autistic traits in 2,502 healthy adults. Two subset groups were used, e.g., the participants of a high-AQ group were randomly selected among the 10% of individuals with the highest AQ scores; similarly, the participants in the low-AQ group were randomly selected from the 10% of participants with the lowest AQ scores. In an experiment, three different facial expressions (positive, neutral, or negative) of the same person were presented successively and pseudo-randomly in each trial. Participants needed to define the expression of the face that was presented last. The results showed that compared with the low-AQ group, the high-AQ group exhibited higher P1 amplitudes induced by the second and third presented expressions, as well as higher P3 amplitudes induced by the third presented negative expressions. This indicates that individuals with autistic traits may experience overly strong perception, attention, and cognitive evaluation to repetitive expressions, particularly negative expressions. This result supports the intense world theory more strongly than the mind-blindness hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W3179722784,"Objectives The impact of benign gynecological conditions on life of women and on costs for the society is high. The purpose of this study is to gain knowledge and understanding of costs of the treatment of these disorders in order to be able to improve the clinical care processes, gain insight into feasible savings opportunities and to allocate funds wisely. Methods The healthcare processes of 311 women attending university or community hospitals in the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District between June 2012 and August 2013 due to a benign gynecological condition were followed up for two years and treatment costs analysed. Results Total direct hospital costs averaged 689€ at six months and 2194€ at two years. The most expensive treatment was that of uterine fibroids in the short term and that of endometriosis and fibroids later on. Costs did not depend on hospital size. Surgical operations caused nearly half of hospital costs. Productivity loss caused biggest expenses outside of the hospital. LNG-IUD (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device) accounted for the largest pharmaceutical costs for patients. Hospital treatment was associated with a reduced need for outpatient services during follow-up. Conclusions A majority of direct hospital costs arise over time. This stresses the need for prolonged healthcare management. To control costs, the need for repetitive doctors’ appointments, monitoring tests, and ward treatments should be carefully evaluated. Procedures not needing an operation theatre (for example hysteroscopy for polypectomy), should be done ambulatorily."
https://openalex.org/W3180789599,"Boosting techniques from the field of statistical learning have grown to be a popular tool for estimating and selecting predictor effects in various regression models and can roughly be separated in two general approaches, namely gradient boosting and likelihood-based boosting. An extensive framework has been proposed in order to fit generalized mixed models based on boosting, however for the case of cluster-constant covariates likelihood-based boosting approaches tend to mischoose variables in the selection step leading to wrong estimates. We propose an improved boosting algorithm for linear mixed models, where the random effects are properly weighted, disentangled from the fixed effects updating scheme and corrected for correlations with cluster-constant covariates in order to improve quality of estimates and in addition reduce the computational effort. The method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches from boosting and maximum likelihood inference which is shown via simulations and various data examples."
https://openalex.org/W3178001353,"Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), a folate-dependent enzyme, is reportedly involved in several cancer types. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism influences many biological processes, including tumorigenesis. However, the association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and breast cancer (BC) subtypes is not fully understood. In this study, the MTHFR C677T polymorphism was genotyped in 490 individuals with or without BC from southwestern China. Analysis of the association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and BC revealed that there was a significant association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) (OR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.12-9.51, P = 0.0401). Furthermore, the MTHFR C677T polymorphism can also serve as a protective factor in luminal A breast cancer (OR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34-0.94, P = 0.0258). Evaluation of the association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and clinical characteristics indicated that people who suffered from hypertension had an increased risk for BC (OR = 2.27; 95% CI: 1.08-4.6; P = 0.0264), especially TNBC (OR = 215.38; 95% CI: 2.45-84430.3; P = 0.0317). Our results suggest that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism is significantly associated with susceptibility to luminal B breast cancer and TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W3178642729,"Background Bioavailable 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) may be a better indicator of vitamin D sufficiency than total 25OHD. This report describes a novel assay for measuring serum bioavailable 25OHD. Methods We developed an assay for 25OHD % bioavailability based on competitive binding of 25OHD tracer between vitamin D-binding protein (DBP)-coated affinity chromatography beads and serum DBP. Bioavailable 25OHD, total 25OHD, albumin, and DBP protein concentrations were measured in 89 samples from hospitalized patients and 42 healthy controls to determine how the DBP binding assay responds to differences in concentrations of DBP and compares to calculated bioavailable 25OHD values. Results DBP binding assay showed a linear relationship between DBP-bound 25OHD tracer recovered from bead supernatant and DBP calibrator concentrations (y = 0.0017x +0.731, R 2 = 0.9961, p&lt;0.001). Inversion of this relationship allowed interpolation of DBP binding equivalents based upon 25OHD tracer recovered. The relationship between DBP binding equivalents and % bioavailability fits a non-linear curve, allowing calculation of % bioavailable 25OHD from DBP binding equivalents (y = 10.625x -0.817 , R 2 = 0.9961, p&lt;0.001). In hospitalized patient samples, there were linear relationships between DBP protein concentrations and DBP binding equivalents (y = 0.7905x + 59.82, R 2 = 0.8597, p&lt;0.001), between measured vs. calculated % bioavailability (y = 0.9528 + 0.0357, R 2 = 0.7200, p&lt;0.001), and between absolute concentrations of measured vs. calculated bioavailable 25OHD (y = 1.2403 + 0.1221, R 2 = 0.8913, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions The DBP-binding assay for bioavailable 25OHD shows expected changes in 25OHD % bioavailability in response to changes in DBP concentrations and concordance with calculated bioavailable 25OHD concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W3178672439,"Objective This study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of a standard clinical training program for new graduate nurses in Vietnam. Methods A quasi-experimental longitudinal study with a difference-in-differences design was conducted. A total of 280 new graduate nurses completed a self-administered questionnaire. The intervention group consisted of 206 respondents (those having participated in standard clinical training) and the control group (those that did not receive training) of 74. Differences in mean increases in competency scores between the intervention and control groups were estimated. The effect size of the intervention was estimated by calculating Cohen’s d. A generalized linear model was employed to identify the factors associated with mean increases. Results The mean increase in total competency scores (range: 0–6 points) in the intervention group was 0.73 points greater than in the control group with an intermediate effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.53; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.80). A greater reduction in standard deviation of total competency scores in the intervention group was confirmed. Participation in standard clinical training produced a positive association with a mean increase in total competency score without significance (β = 0.04, P = 0.321). Provincial hospitals as clinical training venues had a significantly positive association (β = 0.11, P = 0.007) with the mean increase in total competency scores. Competency at pre-clinical training was negatively (β = -0.75, P &lt; 0.001) associated with the mean increase. Conclusion Findings implied that the standard clinical training program could contribute to both increasing and standardizing new graduate nurses’ competencies in Vietnam. Further studies are needed to more precisely examine the attribution of standard clinical training to better increase new graduate nurses’ competencies."
https://openalex.org/W3179790579,"Coarse woody debris (CWD) is a significant component of the forest biomass pool; hence a model is warranted to predict CWD decomposition and its role in forest carbon (C) and nutrient cycling under varying management and climatic conditions. A process-based model, CWDDAT (Coarse Woody Debris Decomposition Assessment Tool) was calibrated and validated using data from the FACE (Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment) Wood Decomposition Experiment utilizing pine ( Pinus taeda ), aspen ( Populous tremuloides ) and birch ( Betula papyrifera ) on nine Experimental Forests (EF) covering a range of climate, hydrology, and soil conditions across the continental USA. The model predictions were evaluated against measured FACE log mass loss over 6 years. Four widely applied metrics of model performance demonstrated that the CWDDAT model can accurately predict CWD decomposition. The R 2 (squared Pearson’s correlation coefficient) between the simulation and measurement was 0.80 for the model calibration and 0.82 for the model validation ( P &lt;0.01). The predicted mean mass loss from all logs was 5.4% lower than the measured mass loss and 1.4% lower than the calculated loss. The model was also used to assess the decomposition of mixed pine-hardwood CWD produced by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 on the Santee Experimental Forest in South Carolina, USA. The simulation reflected rapid CWD decomposition of the forest in this subtropical setting. The predicted dissolved organic carbon (DOC) derived from the CWD decomposition and incorporated into the mineral soil averaged 1.01 g C m -2 y -1 over the 30 years. The main agents for CWD mass loss were fungi (72.0%) and termites (24.5%), the remainder was attributed to a mix of other wood decomposers. These findings demonstrate the applicability of CWDDAT for large-scale assessments of CWD dynamics, and fine-scale considerations regarding the fate of CWD carbon."
https://openalex.org/W3181674920,"As extreme weather is expected to become more frequent with global climate change, it is crucial to evaluate the capacity of species to respond to short-term and unpredictable events. Here, we examined the effect of a strong storm event during the chick-rearing stage of little penguins ( Eudyptula minor ) from a mega colony in southern Australia. We investigated how a 3-day storm affected the foraging behaviour of little penguins by comparing their foraging activities and body mass change before, during and after the storm event. As strong winds deepened the mixed layer in the birds’ foraging zone during the storm, penguins increased their foraging trip duration, had a lower prey encounter rate and a lower body mass gain. The adverse effects on the foraging efficiency of little penguins continued several days after the storm ceased; even though the water column stratification had returned as before the storm, suggesting a prolonged effect of the storm event on the prey availability. Thus, short-term stochastic events can have an extended impact on the foraging efficiency of penguins. When occurring at a crucial stage of breeding, this may affect breeding success."
https://openalex.org/W3177584193,"Solid tumour growth is often associated with the accumulation of mechanical stresses acting on the surrounding host tissue. Due to tissue nonlinearity, the shear modulus of the peri-tumoural region inherits a signature from the tumour expansion which depends on multiple factors, including the soft tissue constitutive behaviour and its stress/strain state. Shear waves used in MR-elastography (MRE) sense the apparent change in shear modulus along their propagation direction, thereby probing the anisotropic stiffness field around the tumour. We developed an analytical framework for a heterogeneous shear modulus distribution using a thick-shelled sphere approximation of the tumour and soft tissue ensemble. A hyperelastic material (plastisol) was identified to validate the proposed theory in a phantom setting. A balloon-catheter connected to a pressure sensor was used to replicate the stress generated from tumour pressure and growth while MRE data were acquired. The shear modulus anisotropy retrieved from the reconstructed elastography data confirmed the analytically predicted patterns at various levels of inflation. An alternative measure, combining the generated deformation and the local wave direction and independent of the reconstruction strategy, was also proposed to correlate the analytical findings with the stretch probed by the waves. Overall, this work demonstrates that MRE in combination with non-linear mechanics, is able to identify the apparent shear modulus variation arising from the strain generated by a growth within tissue, such as an idealised model of tumour. Investigation in real tissue represents the next step to further investigate the implications of endogenous forces in tissue characterisation through MRE."
https://openalex.org/W3177805036,"We have modified the periplasmic Escherichia coli glucose/galactose binding protein (GBP) and labelled with environmentally sensitive fluorophores to further explore its potential as a sensor for the evaluation of glucose concentration in airway surface liquid (ASL). We identified E149C/A213R GBP labelled with N,N'-Dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N'-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)ethylenediamine (IANBD, emission wavelength maximum 536nm) with a Kd for D-glucose of 1.02mM and a fluorescence dynamic range of 5.8. This sensor was specific for D-glucose and exhibited fluorescence stability in experiments for several hours. The use of E149C/A213R GBP-IANBD in the ASL of airway cells grown at air-liquid-interface (ALI) detected an increase in glucose concentration 10 minutes after raising basolateral glucose from 5 to 15mM. This sensor also reported a greater change in ASL glucose concentration in response to increased basolateral glucose in H441 airway cells compared to human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) and there was less variability with HBEC data than that of H441 indicating that HBEC more effectively regulate glucose movement into the ASL. The sensor detected glucose in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALf) from diabetic db/db mice but not normoglycaemic wildtype mice, indicating limited sensitivity of the sensor at glucose concentrations <50μM. Using nasal inhalation of the sensor and spectral unmixing to generate images, E149C/A213R GBP-IANBD fluorescence was detected in luminal regions of cryosections of the murine distal lung that was greater in db/db than wildtype mice. In conclusion, this sensor provides a useful tool for further development to measure luminal glucose concentration in models of lung/airway to explore how this may change in disease."
https://openalex.org/W3177951062,"Objectives Previous studies have shown that adipokines may serve as potential biomarkers reflecting disease activity in various autoimmune diseases. Here, we investigated the relationship between four adipokines and clinical/laboratory findings in patients with microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Methods Sera from 63 patients with MPA and GPA who were registered in a prospective cohort were used to detect serum levels of adiponectin, chemerin, resistin, and vaspin using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Associations between adipokines and clinical and laboratory data was assessed using Pearson’s correlation analysis. Results The median age was 65.0 years, 24 patients were male, and 42 patients were diagnosed with MPA. The median levels of adiponectin, chemerin, resistin, and vaspin in patient sera were 13.9 ng/mL, 9.2 ng/mL, 23.7 ng/mL, and 0.1 ng/mL, respectively. A significant correlation between chemerin level and five-factor score (FFS) was found (r = 0.320, p = 0.011), and resistin was correlated with both Birmingham vasculitis activity score and FFS (r = 0.256, p = 0.043 and r = 0.320, p = 0.011). Regarding laboratory data, adiponectin level was associated with creatinine, and chemerin level was associated with creatinine, albumin, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). On the other hand, resistin was found to be associated with white blood cell count, creatinine, ESR, and C-reactive protein. Age did not have a significant impact on the levels of adipokines. Conclusions The expression of adipokines in the sera of patients with MPA and GPA differs depending on clinical and laboratory features, and serum resistin may be suggested as a potential biomarker reflecting disease activity."
https://openalex.org/W3179297150,"Is it possible to achieve a collaboration between Infectious Diseases (ID) Specialists and General Practitioners (GPs) in the management of chronic HIV infection? A cross sectional survey was conducted among People Living with HIV (PLWHIV) attending the outpatient services of four Italian Infectious Diseases Centers to understand to which extent patients trust their GPs and involve them in the management of their chronic condition. Information about level of communication with GPs, subjective perception of the disease, and presence of co-medications were collected and matched with socio-demographic data using χ 2 statistics. A p&lt;0 . 05 was considered statistically significant. From December 2019 to February 2020, 672 patients completed the survey, 59% males and 56% &gt;50 years. Overall, 508 patients (76%) had informed GPs about HIV-positivity. Communication of diagnosis was significantly associated with age &gt;50years, lower education level, history of disease &gt;10 years and residency in Northern Italy. The “Undetectable = Untrasmittable” (U = U) concept was investigated as an indirect measure of perceived stigma. 23% of subjects was unaware of its meaning. Despite undetectable status, 50% of PLWHIV found difficult to communicate their condition to GPs, especially married (52% vs 48% of unmarried, p = 0 . 003) , well-educated patients (51% vs 48, p = 0 . 007) , living in Southern vs Northern Italy (52% vs 46%, p&lt; 0 . 001 ). More than 75% of the participants consulted the ID specialist for co-medications and DDIs management, often complaining a lack of communication of the former with GPs. Overall, a good level of communication between PLWHIV and GPs was outlined, even if a wider involvement of the latter in HIV care is desirable."
https://openalex.org/W3177826140,"This study estimated the potential impact of early diagnosis programs on health outcomes in England. Specifically, if advising individuals to visit their family doctor due to a suspected case of mild hypertension would result in (i) an increase in the diagnosis and treatment of high blood pressure; (ii) an improved lifestyle reflected in objective measures such as the body-mass-index and blood pressure levels; (iii) a reduced probability of the onset of other cardiovascular diseases, such as diabetes. To address potential selection bias in screening, a feature of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing is exploited, motivating a regression discontinuity design. If respondents’ blood pressure measurements are above a standard clinical threshold, they are advised to visit their family doctor to confirm hypertension. Two years after the protocol, there is evidence of an increase in diagnosis (5.7 pp, p-val = 0.06) and medication use (6 pp, p-val = 0.007) for treating the condition. However, four years after the protocol, the difference in diagnosis and medication disappeared (4 pp, p-val = 0.384; 3.4 pp, p-val = 0.261). Moreover, there are no differences on observed blood pressure levels (systolic 0.026 mmHg, p-val = 0.815; diastolic -0.336 mmHg, p-val = 0.765), or Body-Mass-Index ((0.771, p-val = 0.154)). There are also no differences on diagnosis of diabetes (1.7 pp, p-val = 0.343) or heart related conditions (3.6 pp, p-value = 0.161). In conclusion, the nudge produces an earlier diagnosis of around two years, but there are no perceivable gains in health outcomes after four years."
https://openalex.org/W3178945539,"A broad body of scientific literature exists on the effects that COVID-19 related confinement has had on the population: mental health problems, isolation, and problems concerning cohesion and employment, among others. However, there is a gap in the literature on the actions that reverse some of the effects generated during lockdown. This article collects the results of a study conducted with 53 people participating in a dialogic gathering of films (DGF) that was held online during two months of confinement. The data from the survey show that the development of this DGF generated improvements in 1) personal welfare and attitudes concerning the management of confinement, 2) living together and online relationships, 3) motivation and creativity in the professional domain, and 4) openness to a diversity of perspectives and realities, which improves the understanding, argumentation and positioning in social, scientific and ethical debates."
https://openalex.org/W3179093186,"Although a number of previous studies have shown that different lymphocyte subsets, including B cells, vary with age, how different B cell subsets vary with age in Malawian population has not been shown before. We recruited Malawian participants of different ages and analyzed their venous blood samples for different B cell subsets. We found that both percentage and absolute counts of B cells varied with age peaking in the 7 to 12 months age group. Proportion of naïve B cells was highest in neonates and decreased with age whereas the percentage of memory B cells was lowest in neonates and increased with age. When we zeroed in on the age band within which the proportion of B cells was highest, both classical and activated memory B cells increased with age and the naïve followed the opposite trend. These results provide additional knowledge in our understanding of the dynamics of B cell subsets in individuals of a specific ethnicity as they age."
https://openalex.org/W3179345151,"Human Infection Studies (HIC) involve intentional infection of volunteers with a challenge agent or pathogen with the aim of understanding and developing vaccines as well as understanding the disease pathophysiology in a well-controlled environment. Though Africa carries the highest burden of vaccine-preventable diseases, the region is only now being primed to conduct HIC relevant to its population. Given the imminent introduction of HIC in Zambia, we sought to understand potential participants' willingness to volunteer for such studies. We used a qualitative exploratory approach to understand the potential participants' perceptions on willingness to participate in HIC using the example of typhoid. Healthy adults, recruited using random selection and purposive sampling from higher learning institutions in Lusaka, participated in 15 in-depth interviews (IDIs) and 5 Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) respectively. Participants considered typhoid a serious disease with potential for life-long consequences and death. After sharing audio-visual materials introducing the concepts of HIC, some participants expressed open willingness to participate or alternatively the need to consult parents and professors, and expressed fear of death and illness. Though willing to be quarantined for up to six months, participants expressed concerns regarding separation from family and duties, having insufficient information to decide, inadequate access to care, severe disease, life-long injury or side-effects, death, and vaccine failure. These concerns along with possibility of underlying conditions that compromise individual immunity, competing priorities, parental refusal, and distrust of study or vaccine efficacy could lead to refusal to participate. Reasons for willingness to participate included monetary compensation, altruism and being part of a team that comes up with a vaccine. Though afraid of deliberate typhoid infection, potential participants are willing to consider participation if given adequate information, time to consult trusted persons, compensation and assurance of adequate care."

This study aimed to describe the cascade of care in Oman in 2019 and highlight disparities at the sub-population level. Methods We used the UNAIDS Spectrum modelling software to estimate the number of people living with HIV. A national HIV surveillance database was used to identify Omani people (≥13 years old) diagnosed with HIV from 1984 through December 2019. We calculated the cascade indicators as of 31 December 2019 stratified by sex, age, HIV risk factor, residence, and region of HIV care. We also performed multivariate logistic regression to determine the predictors of attrition at linkage, retention, on ART, and viral suppression. Results As of December 2019, the estimated number of people living with HIV in Oman was 2440. Out of the estimated number of people living with HIV, 69% were diagnosed, 66% were linked to care, 61% were retained in care, 60% were on ART, and 55% were virally suppressed. Of the 1673 diagnosed individuals, 96% were linked to care, 88% were retained in care, 87% were on ART, and 81% were virally suppressed. People who received HIV care outside Muscat had the largest attrition (11% loss) in the transition from linkage (97%) to retention (86%). Similarly, people aged 13–24 years had the largest attrition (13% loss) from “on ART” (88%) to viral suppression (75%). Logistic regression showed that both not reporting a specific HIV risk factor and receipt of HIV care outside Muscat independently predicted attrition at each cascade stage from linkage to care through viral suppression. Conclusions Our findings identified substantial disparities across various subpopulations along the cascade of care in Oman. This analysis will be invaluable in informing future interventions targeting patient subgroups who are at the highest risk of attrition."
https://openalex.org/W3181330512,"The prevalence of tuberculosis among military health system (MHS) and Veterans Affairs (VA) beneficiaries in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands has not been previously reported. Our analysis evaluates the prevalence of M . tuberculosis (MTB) among acid fast bacilli culture(s) (AFB) tested at Tripler Army Medical Center (TAMC) on Oahu, HI and describes demographic factors associated with positive samples. We analyzed 9,768 AFBs from 4,129 individuals with AFB specimens processed at TAMC from January 2002 to November 2019: of those who were tested 3,178 were MHS beneficiaries and 951 were VA beneficiaries. There were a total of 40 individuals with MTB-positive cultures over the period of study: 31 MHS beneficiaries and 9 VA beneficiaries. Of the MTB-positive specimens, 93% were from pulmonary samples while the remainder were from lymph node aspirates (5%) and peritoneal samples (2%). Cumulative incidence rates of MTB-isolation were 1.8 per 100,000 MHS beneficiaries and 1.2 per 100,000 VA beneficiaries, both of which were lower than reported incidence rates in Hawaii, the U.S.-affiliated Pacific Islands and the United States for the study period. MHS beneficiaries of Asian-Pacific Islander race or ethnicity had nearly 20 times higher odds of positive AFB than white MHS beneficiaries (OR = 19.56, 95% CI 5.52, 69.29, p = &lt; 0.001). This study demonstrated a higher odds of MTB-positivity associated with Asian-Pacific Islander race or ethnicity and low incidence rates of TB among MHS and VA beneficiaries in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands when compared with the civilian population."
https://openalex.org/W3182483128,"Background Binge drinking is a pattern of harmful use of alcohol and it is defined as four drinks for women and five drinks for men in about 2 hours. This behavior causes public health problems like damaging different body organs. Objective To assess binge drinking and associated factors among Bahir Dar University students in Northwest Ethiopia. Method A cross sectional study was conducted in November 2017. Systematic sampling technique was used to select 422 participants. Structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Linear and Logistic regression models were used to predict the role of explanatory variables on behavioral intention and binge drinking, respectively. Independent variables with a p-value of &lt;0.05 at 95% confidence interval were considered as statistically significant in the final model. Result A total of 413 students participated in this study and 33.4%(95% CI: 28.3–38.9) were engaged in binge drinking. Experiential attitude, instrumental attitude, and self-efficacy were found to be significant predictors of intention to binge drinking (p&lt;0.05). Experiential attitude, environmental constraint, injunctive norm, and knowledge predictors were significantly associated with binge drinking (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion Our study indicated that one-third of the students practiced binge drinking. This behavior was associated with experiential attitude, injunctive norm, environmental constraints, and knowledge factors. Additionally, experiential attitude, instrumental attitude, and self-efficacy constructs had explained behavioral intention. This implies focusing on the abovementioned determinant factors is imperative while designing intervention strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3182629193,"The analysis of dental wear, at both the microscopic and macroscopic scale, is one of the most widely used tools in archeology and anthropology to reconstruct the diet and lifestyle of past human populations. Biomechanical studies have indicated that tooth wear helps to dissipate the mechanical load over the crown surface, thus reducing the risk of tooth fracture. To date, there are only a few studies that have examined functional tooth wear variation in modern humans. Here we propose to study masticatory efficiency through the use of the Occlusal Fingerprint Analysis method, a well-developed digital approach that allows the reconstruction of the occlusal dynamics occurring during mastication. The aim of this study is to provide the first longitudinal quantitative data of molar and premolar macrowear patterns within a functional context. We examined the mixed and permanent dentition of one Australian Aboriginal child (from ages 8 to 17) from Yuendumu, using high-resolution surface scans of dental casts including both upper and lower arches. Our results suggest that the occlusal macrowear patterns of this individual did not significantly change through time. Occlusal contact parameters such as functional area, inclination and direction remain relatively unaltered throughout childhood and adolescence, indicating little change in the masticatory function of this individual. The functional tooth wear pattern in this individual did not change longitudinally indicating the degree of masticatory efficiency has most probably remained unaltered."
