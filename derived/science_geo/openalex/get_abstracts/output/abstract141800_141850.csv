https://openalex.org/W2064470441,"The amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) is directly and efficiently cleaved by caspases during apoptosis, resulting in elevated amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide formation. The predominant site of caspase-mediated proteolysis is within the cytoplasmic tail of APP, and cleavage at this site occurs in hippocampal neurons in vivo following acute excitotoxic or ischemic brain injury. Caspase-3 is the predominant caspase involved in APP cleavage, consistent with its marked elevation in dying neurons of Alzheimer’s disease brains and colocalization of its APP cleavage product with Aβ in senile plaques. Caspases thus appear to play a dual role in proteolytic processing of APP and the resulting propensity for Aβ peptide formation, as well as in the ultimate apoptotic death of neurons in Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W2026169768,"Misfolding or unfolding of polypeptides can occur as a consequence of environmental stress and spontaneous mutation. The abundance of general chaperones and proteases suggests that cells distinguish between proteins that can be refolded and ""hopeless"" cases fated to enter the proteolytic pathway. The mechanisms controlling this key metabolic decision are not well understood. We show here that the widely conserved heat shock protein DegP (HtrA) has both general molecular chaperone and proteolytic activities. The chaperone function dominates at low temperatures, while the proteolytic activity is present at elevated temperatures. These results show that a single cellular factor can switch between two key pathways, controlling protein stability and turnover. Implications of this finding for intracellular protein metabolism are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1971908364,"A peat core from a bog in northwest Spain provides a record of the net accumulation of atmospheric mercury since 4000 radiocarbon years before the present. It was found that cold climates promoted an enhanced accumulation and the preservation of mercury with low thermal stability, and warm climates were characterized by a lower accumulation and the predominance of mercury with moderate to high thermal stability. This record can be separated into natural and anthropogenic components. The substantial anthropogenic mercury component began ∼2500 radiocarbon years before the present, which is near the time of the onset of mercury mining in Spain. Anthropogenic mercury has dominated the deposition record since the Islamic period (8th to 11th centuries A.D.). The results shown here have implications for the global mercury cycle and also imply that the thermal lability of the accumulated mercury can be used not only to quantify the effects of human activity, but also as a new tool for quantitative paleotemperature reconstruction."

https://openalex.org/W2008243144,"Salmonella typhimurium lacking DNA adenine methylase (Dam) were fully proficient in colonization of mucosal sites but showed severe defects in colonization of deeper tissue sites. These Dam – mutants were totally avirulent and were effective as live vaccines against murine typhoid fever. Dam regulated the expression of at least 20 genes known to be induced during infection; a subset of these genes are among those activated by the PhoP global virulence regulator. PhoP, in turn, affected Dam methylation at specific genomic sites, as evidenced by alterations in DNA methylation patterns. Dam inhibitors are likely to have broad antimicrobial action, and Dam – derivatives of these pathogens may serve as live attenuated vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1573413333,"It has been hypothesized that neoplastic progression develops as a consequence of an acquired genetic instability and the subsequent evolution of clonal populations with accumulated genetic errors1. Accordingly, human cancers and some premalignant lesions contain multiple genetic abnormalities not present in the normal tissues from which the neoplasms arose2,3. Barrett oesophagus (BE) is a premalignant condition which predisposes to oesophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) that can be biopsied prospectively over time because endoscopic surveillance is recommended for early detection of cancer4,5. In addition, oesophagectomy specimens frequently contain the premalignant epithelium from which the cancer arose6. Neoplastic progression in BE is associated with alterations in TP53 (also known as p53) and CDKN2A (also known as p16) and non-random losses of heterozygosity7,8,9,10,11 (LOH). Aneuploid or increased 4N populations occur in more than 90-95% of EAs, arise in premalignant epithelium and predict progression10,12,13. We have previously shown in small numbers of patients that disruption of TP53 and CDKN2A typically occurs before aneuploidy and cancer10,11,14,15. Here, we determine the evolutionary relationships of non-random LOH, TP53 and CDKN2A mutations, CDKN2A CpG-island methylation and ploidy during neoplastic progression. Diploid cell progenitors with somatic genetic or epigenetic abnormalities in TP53 and CDKN2A were capable of clonal expansion, spreading to large regions of oesophageal mucosa. The subsequent evolution of neoplastic progeny frequently involved bifurcations and LOH at 5q, 13q and 18q that occurred in no obligate order relative to each other, DNA-content aneuploidy or cancer. Our results indicate that clonal evolution is more complex than predicted by linear models."

In a screen for small molecules that activate the human insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, a nonpeptidyl fungal metabolite (L-783,281) was identified that acted as an insulin mimetic in several biochemical and cellular assays. The compound was selective for insulin receptor versus insulin-like growth factor I (IGFI) receptor and other receptor tyrosine kinases. Oral administration of L-783,281 to two mouse models of diabetes resulted in significant lowering in blood glucose levels. These results demonstrate the feasibility of discovering novel insulin receptor activators that may lead to new therapies for diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2054708511,"Ethylene is an important regulator of plant growth. We identified an Arabidopsis mutant, responsive-to-antagonist1 (ran1), that shows ethylene phenotypes in response to treatment with trans-cyclooctene, a potent receptor antagonist. Genetic epistasis studies revealed an early requirement for RAN1 in the ethylene pathway. RAN1 was cloned and found to encode a protein with similarity to copper-transporting P-type ATPases, including the human Menkes/Wilson proteins and yeast Ccc2p. Expression of RAN1 complemented the defects of a ccc2delta mutant, demonstrating its function as a copper transporter. Transgenic CaMV 35S::RAN1 plants showed constitutive expression of ethylene responses, due to cosuppression of RAN1. These results provide an in planta demonstration that ethylene signaling requires copper and reveal that RAN1 acts by delivering copper to create functional hormone receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2155511306,"Cytosolic phospholipase A2 initiates the biosynthesis of prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor (PAF), mediators of the pathophysiology of asthma and arthritis. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of human cPLA2 at 2.5 A. cPLA2 consists of an N-terminal calcium-dependent lipid-binding/C2 domain and a catalytic unit whose topology is distinct from that of other lipases. An unusual Ser-Asp dyad located in a deep cleft at the center of a predominantly hydrophobic funnel selectively cleaves arachidonyl phospholipids. The structure reveals a flexible lid that must move to allow substrate access to the active site, thus explaining the interfacial activation of this important lipase."
https://openalex.org/W2063260609,"To study the nuclear organization and dynamics of nucleotide excision repair (NER), the endonuclease ERCC1/XPF (for excision repair cross complementation group 1/xeroderma pigmentosum group F) was tagged with green fluorescent protein and its mobility was monitored in living Chinese hamster ovary cells. In the absence of DNA damage, the complex moved freely through the nucleus, with a diffusion coefficient (15 +/- 5 square micrometers per second) consistent with its molecular size. Ultraviolet light-induced DNA damage caused a transient dose-dependent immobilization of ERCC1/XPF, likely due to engagement of the complex in a single repair event. After 4 minutes, the complex regained mobility. These results suggest (i) that NER operates by assembly of individual NER factors at sites of DNA damage rather than by preassembly of holocomplexes and (ii) that ERCC1/XPF participates in repair of DNA damage in a distributive fashion rather than by processive scanning of large genome segments."
https://openalex.org/W2060763966,Transcription factors are often phosphorylated at multiple sites. Here it is shown that multiple phosphorylation sites on the budding yeast transcription factor Pho4 play distinct and separable roles in regulating the factor's activity. Phosphorylation of Pho4 at two sites promotes the factor's nuclear export and phosphorylation at a third site inhibits its nuclear import. Phosphorylation of a fourth site blocks the interaction of Pho4 with the transcription factor Pho2. Multiple phosphorylation sites provide overlapping and partially redundant layers of regulation that function to efficiently control the activity of Pho4.

https://openalex.org/W1978440190,"The double-ring chaperonin GroEL mediates protein folding in the central cavity of a ring bound by ATP and GroES, but it is unclear how GroEL cycles from one folding-active complex to the next. We observe that hydrolysis of ATP within the cis ring must occur before either nonnative polypeptide or GroES can bind to the trans ring, and this is associated with reorientation of the trans ring apical domains. Subsequently, formation of a new cis-ternary complex proceeds on the open trans ring with polypeptide binding first, which stimulates the ATP-dependent dissociation of the cis complex (by 20- to 50-fold), followed by GroES binding. These results indicate that, in the presence of nonnative protein, GroEL alternates its rings as folding-active cis complexes, expending only one round of seven ATPs per folding cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2114972602,"E. coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) is a class II enzyme that represses the translation of its own mRNA. We report the crystal structure at 2.9 Å resolution of the complex between tRNAThr and ThrRS, whose structural features reveal novel strategies for providing specificity in tRNA selection. These include an amino-terminal domain containing a novel protein fold that makes minor groove contacts with the tRNA acceptor stem. The enzyme induces a large deformation of the anticodon loop, resulting in an interaction between two adjacent anticodon bases, which accounts for their prominent role in tRNA identity and translational regulation. A zinc ion found in the active site is implicated in amino acid recognition/discrimination."

The individual components are designed and fabricated of polyurethane by molding; selected faces are coated with a thin film of liquid, metallic alloy. Under mild agitation in warm, aqueous potassium bromide solution, capillary forces between the films of alloy cause self-assembly. The structures of the resulting, self-assembled arrays are determined by structural features of the component parts: the three-dimensional shape of the components, the pattern of alloy on their surfaces, and the shape of the alloy-coated surfaces. Self-assembly of appropriately designed chiral pieces generates helices."
https://openalex.org/W2027197597,"The PCH2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for the meiotic checkpoint that prevents chromosome segregation when recombination and chromosome synapsis are defective. Mutation of PCH2 relieves the checkpoint-induced pachytene arrest of the zip1, zip2, and dmc1 mutants, resulting in chromosome missegregation and low spore viability. Most of the Pch2 protein localizes to the nucleolus, where it represses meiotic interhomolog recombination in the ribosomal DNA, apparently by excluding the meiosis-specific Hop1 protein. Nucleolar localization of Pch2 depends on the silencing factor Sir2, and mutation of SIR2 also bypasses the zip1 pachytene arrest. Under certain circumstances, Sir3-dependent localization of Pch2 to telomeres also provides checkpoint function. These unexpected findings link the nucleolus, chromatin silencing, and the pachytene checkpoint."

https://openalex.org/W2068598166,"Resistance in the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner), to a commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) Berliner toxin, Dipel ES, appears to be inherited as an incompletely dominant autosomal gene. This contrasts with the inheritance of resistance to Bt in other insects, where it has usually been characterized as a recessive trait. The proposed high-dose/refuge strategy for resistance management in Bt maize depends on resistance being recessive or partially recessive. If field resistance turns out to be similar to this laboratory resistance, the usefulness of the high-dose/refuge strategy for resistance management in Bt maize may be diminished."

It accurately reproduces most ground state vibration-rotation-tunneling spectra and yields excellent second viral coefficients. The calculated dimer structure and dipole moment are very close to those determined from microwave spectroscopy and high-level ab initio calculations. The dimer binding energy and acceptor switching and donor-acceptor interchange tunneling barriers are in excellent agreement with recent ab initio theory, as are cyclic water trimer and tetramer structures and binding energies."

https://openalex.org/W2087437823,"Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and type 2 NO synthase (NOS2) are crucial for defense against bacterial and parasitic pathogens, but their relationship in innate immunity is unknown. In the absence of NOS2 activity, IL-12 was unable to prevent spreading of Leishmania parasites, did not stimulate natural killer (NK) cells for cytotoxicity or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) release, and failed to activate Tyk2 kinase and to tyrosine phosphorylate Stat4 (the central signal transducer of IL-12) in NK cells. Activation of Tyk2 in NK cells by IFN-alpha/beta also required NOS2. Thus, NOS2-derived NO is a prerequisite for cytokine signaling and function in innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2161314639,"Several growth factor- and calcium-regulated kinases such as pp90 rsk or CaM kinase IV can phosphorylate the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) at serine 103 (Ser-103). However, it is unknown whether stress-regulated kinases can also phosphorylate SRF. We show that treatment of cells with anisomycin, arsenite, sodium fluoride, or tetrafluoroaluminate induces phosphorylation of SRF at Ser-103 in both HeLa and NIH3T3 cells. This phosphorylation is dependent on the kinase p38/SAPK2 and correlates with the activation of MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2). MK2 phosphorylates SRFin vitro at Ser-103 with similar efficiency as the small heat shock protein Hsp25 and significantly better than CREB. Comparison of wild type murine fibroblasts with those derived from MK2-deficient mice (Mk(−/−)) reveals MK2 as the major SRF kinase induced by arsenite. These results demonstrate that SRF is targeted by several signal transduction pathways within cells and establishes SRF as a nuclear target for MAPKAP kinase 2.

SREs are bound by the transcription factor serum response factor (SRF) permitting the recruitment of SRF accessory factors like the Ets-family ternary complex factors (TCFs). SRF binds with its MADS domain as a homodimer to the CArG box, which has the consensus sequence C2(A/T)6G2 (1Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Ternary complex factors, namely Elk-1, Sap-1, and Net-1 can only bind to the c-fos SRE via adjacent GGAT Ets-binding sites in the presence of SRF. In addition, on its 3′-site the c-fosSRF-binding site is flanked by an AP-1-like site (3Velcich A. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6273-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In vivo footprinting studies suggest that all three sites of the c-fos SRE element are continuously occupied (4Herrera R.E. Shaw P.E. Nordheim A. Nature. 1989; 340: 68-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The SRE is a converging point for several signal transduction cascades. Particularly well documented is the role of TCFs as nuclear targets in signal transduction. C-terminal TCF phosphorylation by MAP kinases such as ERKs, JNKs, or p38 members results in transcriptional activation (5Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E.

In contrast, the role of SRF in phosphorylation-regulated gene expression is not well understood. Small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family regulate c-fos expression via SRF (12Hill C.S. Wynne J.

However, it is unclear which kinase cascade transmits the signal toward SRF, and whether SRF is a direct target of phosphorylation, or instead acts primarily as a docking element for another protein. SRF contains several phosphorylation sites (14Marais R.M. Hsuan J.J. McGuigan C. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), although functional consequences, particularly of C-terminal SRF phosphorylation, have not been identified unequivocally. N-terminal phosphorylation including that of Ser-103 immediately N-terminal to the MADS box affects the interaction of SRF with its DNA recognition sequence (14Marais R.M. Hsuan J.J. McGuigan C. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15Janknecht R. Hipskind R.A. Houthaeve T. Nordheim A. Stunnenberg H.G.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Two groups of kinases have been shown so far to phosphorylate SRF at Ser-103: pp90 rsk, also known as MAPKAP-K1, which is activated by serum via ERKs, as well as CaM kinases II and IV, which are regulated by calcium levels (16Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.-H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 17Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We wondered whether a link existed between activation of gene expression by Rho GTPases and SRF phosphorylation at Ser-103. Here we investigated whether agents known to activate SRF-dependent gene expression, possibly involving activation of or cooperation with Rho GTPases, cause SRF phosphorylation at Ser-103. In addition, we intended to identify kinases phosphorylating SRF. Using in-gel kinase assays we screened for SRF kinases induced by anisomycin, tetrafluoroaluminate, arsenite, and stress factors, and measured the resulting SRF phosphorylation of Ser-103. We show that these factors activate p38-dependent SRF kinases. In particular we identify MAPKAP-K2 (MK2) as an SRF kinase and demonstrate that MK2 contributes to SRF phosphorylation at Ser-103in vivo. In Mk2(−/−) fibroblasts arsenite-induced SRF phosphorylation at Ser-103 is greatly reduced. Our data identify SRF as a direct intracellular target of signal transduction cascades activated by tumor-promoting and stress-inducing stimuli (18Cohen P. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Cells were kept at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 92% humidity. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/l streptomycin, HeLa cells in minimal essential medium containing 10% FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/liter streptomycin. For immortalization, mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived fromMk2(+/+) and Mk2(−/−) mice 2A.

For the preparation of cell extracts cells were grown on 10-cm dishes. After treatment, cell culture supernatants were discarded and cell layers were washed with 5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 mm sodium fluoride and 2 mmNa3VO4. The washing solution was removed completely followed by addition of 400 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 μmZnCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 400 nm ocadaic acid, 10 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm Na3VO4, 500 μmbenzamidin, 1 unit/ml α-macroglobulin, 2 mg/l aprotinin, 500 μg/l leupeptin, 500 μg/pepstatin, and 500 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (19Zinck R.

Lysed cells were collected by scraping, transferred into a 1.5-ml reaction tube, and vortexed. Lysates were obtained by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C at 16,000 × g. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. To immunoprecipitate MK2 and JNKs, cell extracts (25 μl) were incubated with 10 μl of a 50% suspension of anti-MK2/3 (20Schultz H.

After centrifugation and washing twice with lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl followed by two further washes with lysis buffer, the conjugate was resuspended in 20 μl of sample buffer and subjected to an in-gel kinase assay.

To analyze the SRF phosphorylation status at Ser-103, 0.5 μl of affinity purified anti-P-SRF antibody was included in the reaction mixture. This phospho-specific antiserum recognizes SRF when phosphorylated at Ser-103 (16Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.-H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell.

After a 30-min incubation period at room temperature the DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5 × Tris borate buffer at 10 V/cm. After electrophoresis gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImaging screens (Fuji). To express recombinant SRF, a BamHI/EcoRI fragment containing the SRF gene with an N-terminal His-tag was cloned into pILA503 (21Schauder B. Blöcker H. Frank R. McCarthy J.E.G. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). His-tagged SRF was purified from Escherichia coli BL21-LysS/pILASRF after heat induction. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A (6 m guanidinium-HCl, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) per g of pellet net weight and swirled for 1 h at room temperature. After addition of 1.25 ml of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) the suspension was incubated under rotation for another 45 min. The suspension was transferred into a column and washed three times with 4 column volumes of buffer C (8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmTris, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 6.3). SRF was eluted with 8 column volumes of buffer E (8 m urea, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 4.1). Fractions of 2 ml were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. SRF-containing fractions were combined, glycerol was added to 10%, and the solution was dialyzed against 100 fraction volumes of dialysis buffer (100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) containing 4m urea and 25% glycerol at 4 °C. After every 2 h the dialysis buffer was exchanged against fresh buffer containing a 2-fold lower concentration of urea. After final dialysis overnight at 4 °C against urea-free dialysis buffer containing 43% glycerol, SRF aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Cell extracts were mixed with an equal volume of sample buffer (20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 25 mg/l bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8), heated for 5 min at 95 °C and cooled on ice. The samples were loaded on 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5 mg/l His-SRF or 40 mg/liter of the other substrates used. After electrophoresis at 20 V/cm the gels were incubated for 30 min in 250 ml of DR buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol) containing 20% 2-propanol followed by 30 min in 250 ml of DR buffer. The proteins were denatured by incubation for 1 h in 150 ml of DR buffer containing 6 m guanidinium thiocyanate with exchange of the buffer after 30 min. Renaturation of electrophoresed proteins was performed by incubation of the gel in 250 ml of DR buffer containing 0.04% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight, followed by a 2-h incubation with two buffer exchanges. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h in 240 ml of kinase buffer (25 mmHEPES pH 7.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmMgCl2, 90 μm Na3VO4), the gel was swirled in 10 ml of kinase buffer containing 5 MBq of [α-32P]ATP for 1 h, followed by incubation in 250 ml of washing buffer (5% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mmsodium pyrophosphate) for 2 days with frequent buffer exchanges. Finally, gels were dried and exposed to PhosphorImaging screens. For in vitro phosphorylation, constitutively active kinase MK2Δ3BΔPC was incubated in kinase assay buffer (50 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.4, 100 μm EDTA, 100 μm ATP (22 kBq/μl), 4 mm magnesium) acetate with 80 mg/liter substrate protein for 10 min at 30 °C. His-tagged SRF, His-tagged CREB and murine Hsp25 were used as substrates. For immunoblotting analysis, 140 mg/l SRF were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of sample buffer. After denaturation at 65 °C for 5 min, the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by either PhosphorImaging analysis or blotting on a PVDF membrane. Immunoblotting was essentially performed as described (17Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Blots were blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBST (1.4 mm KH2PO4, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 2 h followed by overnight incubation with affinity purified anti-P-SRF antibody (1:500 diluted in PBST containing 4% bovine serum albumin). Phospho-SRF was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham). After detection of phospho-SRF, the blots were rinsed with methanol and shaken for 30 min at 50 °C in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). After blocking with 4% bovine serum albumin in PBST the blots were incubated with an anti-SRF antiserum (1:200 diluted), and SRF was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. For the detection of MK2 phosphorylation sites in SRF, 20 μg of either full-length SRF or core SRF (amino acids 90–244 of SRF) were labeled as described above, with the exception of an extended labeling time of 8 h.32P-Labeled SRF (0.4 mg/ml) was digested with 0.4 μg of endopeptidase Lys-C (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.1, for 14 h at 37 °C. Digestion was terminated by addition of one-fifth volume of 10% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides generated were fractionated by reversed phase-HPLC applying the mixture to a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 narrow bore column from the SMART™ System (LKB Pharmacia, Sweden) with peak detection. The peptides were eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid buffer using a gradient of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile (5–50%). Elution was for 60 min and a flow rate of 100 μl/min at room temperature was applied. About 80 fractions were automatically collected and subjected to Cerenkov counting. Peptide identification in the radioactive fractions was first performed conventionally with a Procise protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems model 494A) operating with the routine sequencer program. Then, another part of the fraction was covalently bound to a Sequelon arylamine membrane (Millipore) and solid phase sequenced collecting the anilinothiazolinones after their extraction from the arylamine disc (methanol/water, 9:1, 1 mm phosphate) with the fraction collector of an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer. At each cycle of Edman degradation 32P radioactivity released was measured. Stimulation of serum-starved NIH3T3 fibroblasts with FCS results in a rapid and transient induction of SRF phosphorylation at Ser-103, which, at least in part, can be attributed to the activity of the protein kinase pp90 rsk(MAPKAP-K1) (16Rivera V.M.

However, other downstream kinases of the MAPK cascades, such as MAPKAP-K2 (MK2) (22Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R.

To examine more specifically the role of stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathways of the JNK and p38 classes, we stimulated HeLa cells with anisomycin and tetrafluoroaluminate which have been recently shown to induce immediate early gene expression including c-fos by activating or cooperating with Rho GTPases (12Hill C.S.

We analyzed kinase activities and SRF phosphorylation by EMSA supershift assays using an α-phospho-Ser-103-SRF antiserum (Fig.1), by in-gel kinase assays (Fig.2) and by directly measuring kinase activities in all cell extracts (Fig. 3). Since tetrafluoroaluminate is formed in solution by mixing aluminum chloride and sodium fluoride, we included these two compounds as controls in our study. In all assays shown in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, we analyzed the identical extracts to allow a direct comparison of the results.Figure 2Induction of SRF kinases and c-Jun kinases in HeLa cells. Identical HeLa cell lysates as used in Fig. 1 were examined by in-gel kinase analysis. The length standards are shown on the left of each gel, the copolymerized substrate (SRF, c-Jun, or no substrate) is indicated on the right side. All three gels were run using the same extracts, whereby the SRF gel was run on a different day than the c-Jun and the control gels. Panel A, in-gel kinase assay with SRF as copolymerized substrate. Thearrow indicates the major induced SRF kinase of 50 kDa. As shown, this kinase activity corresponds to MK2. Panel B,in-gel kinase assay with c-Jun as copolymerized substrate.

MK2 (Panel A) or p38/SAPK2 (Panel B) were immunoprecipitated from the identical HeLa extracts used for Figs.1 and 2 and examined for their activity using either GST-Hsp25 (Panel A) or GST-MK2 (Panel B) as substrates for phosphorylation. The reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the intensities of bands corresponding to32P-labeled substrates were quantified by PhosphorImaging analysis. Inducers were anisomycin, sodium fluoride, tetrafluoroaluminate, or aluminum chloride. The relative inductions were measured 15 (black bars), 30 (hatched bars), and 60 (gray bars) min after addition of the corresponding inducer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Using EMSA supershift analysis we first examined the extent of SRF Ser-103 phosphorylation before and after treatment of cells with the different agents. As a DNA-binding probe we used the c-fosSRE sequence. Addition of a phospho-Ser-103-specific α-SRF antiserum to the DNA binding reaction causes a mobility supershift of phospho-SRF-containing protein-DNA complexes (16Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.-H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 17Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In these assays, HeLa cell extracts show two bands (Fig. 1). According to control lanes with recombinant protein (Fig. 1, lane 1), the faster migrating band represents the binary complex containing only SRF homodimer bound to the SRE whereas the slower band represents the ternary complex containing SRE, SRF homodimer, and an additional TCF protein. In extracts of uninduced cells, addition of α-phospho-Ser-103-SRF antiserum causes only a very weak supershift (Fig. 1, lane 2). Therefore, only a minor fraction of SRF is phosphorylated at Ser-103 in uninduced HeLa cells. Treatment of these cells for 15, 30, or 60 min with anisomycin induces SRF phosphorylation at Ser-103, leading to a complete supershift of both SRF containing bands (Fig. 1, lanes 3–5). No obvious decrease in the degree of SRF phosphorylation is observed during 60 min of anisomycin treatment. The tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor sodium fluoride also induces SRF phosphorylation, albeit with slower kinetics compared with anisomycin (Fig. 1, lanes 6–8). No significant SRF phosphorylation can be detected after 15 min, whereas after 30 and 60 min both the binary and the ternary complex bands are completely supershifted by α-phospho-Ser-103-SRF antiserum. Aluminum chloride does not induce SRF phosphorylation (Fig. 1, lanes 9–11). However, tetrafluoroaluminate induces SRF phosphorylation with similar kinetics as sodium fluoride (Fig. 1, lanes 12–14). Indeed, we observed no difference between sodium fluoride and tetrafluoroaluminate in any assay used in this report. To characterize potential SRF kinases induced by anisomycin, sodium fluoride, and tetrafluoroaluminate, the HeLa cell lysates used in Fig.1 were analyzed by in-gel kinase assays with copolymerized SRF (Fig.2 A). Several bands, particularly at 50, 55, and 60 kDa become visible after induction, with the 50-kDa band being the most prominent one. This increase in intensity cannot be attributed to autophosphorylation, since the corresponding region in the substrate-free control gel shows only weakly activated kinase bands (Fig. 2 C, compare indicated bands in lanes 3, 4, 7, or 10 with lane 1). Interestingly, anisomycin (lanes 2–4) induces the corresponding kinases within 15 min and, therefore, more rapidly than either sodium fluoride (lanes 5–7) or tetrafluoroaluminate which required 30 min (lanes 8–10). With these three stimulators the induction lasts for at least 60 min. Aluminum chloride does not induce any SRF kinase (lanes 11–13). Therefore, the activation kinetics of these SRF kinases parallel the phosphorylation kinetics of SRF at Ser-103 (Fig. 1). Since the size of the 55-kDa band seen in Fig. 2 A agrees with the reported molecular weight of JNK2 (26Cano E. Doza Y.N. Ben-Levy R. Cohen P. Mahadevan L.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 805-812PubMed Google Scholar), we examined JNK/SAPK1 activation in parallel in the same lysates using, instead of SRF, c-Jun as in-gel substrate (Fig. 2 B). In c-Jun-containing gels, a different pattern of induced kinases compared with SRF gels is observed. Whereas the 50-kDa kinase is absent, two bands of 46 and 55 kDa are strongly induced. Thus, these two bands very likely reflect activated JNK1 and -2. As already seen for SRF kinases (Fig.2 A), anisomycin (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2–4) activates both JNKs with faster kinetics than tetrafluoroaluminate (lanes 5–7) and sodium fluoride (lanes 8–10). Again, no Jun kinase is activated by addition of aluminum chloride (lanes 11–13). The observed increase in intensities is not due to autophosphorylation, as shown by the control gel (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, anisomycin, sodium fluoride, and tetrafluoroaluminate apparently induce the same SRF and Jun kinases, respectively, but with different kinetics. Aluminum chloride does not induce any kinase in the in-gel kinase assays used here. Based on the apparent molecular mass, the 50-kDa band seen in the SRF gel of Fig. 2 A may represent human MK2 (26Cano E. Doza Y.N. Ben-Levy R. Cohen P. Mahadevan L.C. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 805-812PubMed Google Scholar). To examine directly the possible activation of MK2 and its upstream activating kinase, namely p38/SAPK2, both kinases were immunoprecipitated from the respective HeLa cell extracts followed by analysis of their activities by in vitro phosphorylation assays (Fig. 3). In contrast to aluminum chloride, which does not activate either MK2 (Fig.3 A) or p38/SAPK2 (Fig. 3 B), anisomycin, sodium fluoride, and tetrafluoroaluminate lead to activation of both MK2 and p38/SAPK2. Anisomycin activates both kinases within 15 min to maximal extent, whereas maximal activation of MK2 and p38/SAPK2 by sodium fluoride or tetrafluoroaluminate takes more than 30 min. In addition, p38/SAPK2 isolated from sodium fluoride- or tetrafluoroaluminate-treated cells exhibits only 50% of the activity caused by anisomycin treatment. Thus, despite similar extents of MK2 activation, sodium fluoride and tetrafluoroaluminate are less potent p38 inducers than anisomycin. However, anisomycin-, sodium fluoride-, and tetrafluoroaluminate-mediated activation of the p38/MK2 signal transduction pathway correlates with the induction of SRF phosphorylation at Ser-103. Since activation of MK2 parallels SRF phosphorylation at Ser-103, we suspected that MK2 might directly phosphorylate SRF. To test whether MK2 phosphorylates SRFin vitro, we analyzed recombinant constitutively active MK2 and anisomycin-induced HeLa extracts using in-gel kinase assays. Different in-gel substrates were employed (Fig.4, A-F). Hsp25 is a published MK2 substrate (27Engel K. Kotlyarov A. Gaestel M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3363-3371Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and served as a positive control for renaturation of MK2 during in-gel kinase assays. The size of recombinant MK2 is 66 kDa due to its GST tag. In this assay both the recombinant as well as endogenous anisomycin-induced MK2 phosphorylate Hsp25 and SRF (Fig. 4,A and B). Recombinant MK2 also phosphorylates c-Jun, whereas endogenous MK2 is probably masked by prominent JNK/SAPK1 activity (Fig. 4 C). Endogenous MK2 phosphorylates the MK2 substrate weakly, whereas with recombinant MK2 autophosphorylation is not visible (Fig. 4 E). This finding is consistent with the autophosphorylation of the 50-kDa band observed in Fig. 2 C. Neither recombinant nor endogenous MK2 phosphorylate the TCF/Ets transcription factor Elk-1 (Fig. 4 D) or histone H1 (Fig.4 F). However, Elk-1 (Fig. 4 D), as well as c-Jun (Fig. 4C), are efficiently phosphorylated by two 46- and 55-kDa kinases correlating w"

While this colinear relationship is a property of most metazoans with an anterior to posterior polarity, the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. Previous work suggested that Hox genes were made progressively available for transcription in the course of gastrulation, implying the existence of an element capable of initiating a repressive conformation, subsequently relieved from the clusters sequentially. We searched for this element by combining a genomic walk with successive transgene insertions upstream of the HoxD complex followed by a series of deletions. The largest deficiency induced posterior homeotic transformations coincidentally with an earlier activation of Hoxd genes. These data suggest that a regulatory element located upstream of the complex is necessary for setting up the early pattern of Hox gene colinear activation."

Comparison of the structures of the substrate-free enzyme and the complex with a bisubstrate analog, coenzyme A-S-acetyltryptamine, demonstrates that acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) binding is accompanied by a large conformational change that in turn leads to the formation of the serotonin-binding site. The structure of the complex also provides insight into how the enzyme may facilitate acetyl transfer. A water-filled channel leading from the active site to the surface provides a pathway for proton removal following amine deprotonation.

https://openalex.org/W2072722219,"The external nucleus of the inferior colliculus in the barn owl contains an auditory map of space that is based on the tuning of neurons for interaural differences in the timing of sound. In juvenile owls, this region of the brain can acquire alternative maps of interaural time difference as a result of abnormal experience. It has been found that, in an external nucleus that is expressing a learned, abnormal map, the circuitry underlying the normal map still exists but is functionally inactivated by inhibition mediated by γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A ) receptors. This inactivation results from disproportionately strong inhibition of specific input channels to the network. Thus, experience-driven changes in patterns of inhibition, as well as adjustments in patterns of excitation, can contribute critically to adaptive plasticity in the central nervous system."

The vertebrate APC is thought to be composed of 8 subunits, whereas in budding yeast several additional APC-associated proteins have been identified, including a 33-kDa protein called Doc1 or Apc10. Here, we show that Doc1/Apc10 is a subunit of the yeast APC throughout the cell cycle. Mutation of Doc1/Apc10 inactivates the APC without destabilizing the complex. An ortholog of Doc1/Apc10, which we call APC10, is associated with the APC in different vertebrates, including humans and frogs. Biochemical fractionation experiments and mass spectrometric analysis of a component of the purified human APC show that APC10 is a genuine APC subunit whose cellular levels or association with the APC are not cell cycle-regulated. We have further identified an APC10 homology region, which we propose to call the DOC domain, in several protein sequences that also contain either cullin or HECT domains. Cullins are present in several ubiquitination complexes including the APC, whereas HECT domains represent the catalytic core of a different type of ubiquitin-protein ligase. DOC domains may therefore be important for reactions catalyzed by several types of ubiquitin-protein ligases."

Examples include the regulation of cytokine production from neutrophils, 2Page, S. M., Gleich, G. J., and Thomas, L. L. (1999) J. Immunol. Methods, in press. eosinophils (11Kita H. Abu-Ghazaleh R.I.

Gleich G.J. Thomas L.L. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1981-1991Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Additionally, blood concentrations of the pro-form of MBP (pro-MBP) increase dramatically during human pregnancy (14Wagner J.M. Bartemes K. Vernof K.K. Dunnette S. Offord K.P. Checkel J.L.

Altogether, these observations support MBP's involvement in the pathophysiology of allergic and eosinophil-associated diseases and its beneficial role in resistance to parasitic disease. To further characterize gene products important in eosinophil function, we sought to identify novel genes transcribed by precursor blood cells cultured in the presence of interleukin (IL)-5, a cytokine that causes eosinophil proliferation, differentiation, and activation (3Kita H. Adolphson C.R. Gleich G.J. Middleton Jr., E. Reed C.E. Ellis E.F. Adkinson Jr., N.F. Yunginger J.W. Busse W.W. 5th Ed. Allergy: Principles and Practice. 1. Mosby, St. Louis1998: 242-260Google Scholar). The approach chosen involved large scale cDNA sequencing (18Okubo K. Hori N. Matoba R. Niiyama T. Fukushima A. Kojima Y. Matsubara K. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) of thousands of plasmid-inserted cDNAs generated from the IL-5-differentiated precursor cells. The resulting frequency profile of the sequenced cDNAs, referred to as a Transcript Image, provides a quantitative and qualitative record of gene expression (18Okubo K. Hori N. Matoba R. Niiyama T. Fukushima A. Kojima Y. Matsubara K. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 19Anderson L. Seilhamer J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Transcript Image of the IL-5-differentiated precursor cells revealed a transcript with significant homology to human prepro-major basic protein (hprepro-MBP). This transcript was named hprepro-MBP homolog (hprepro-MBPH). Compared with previous MBP molecules, the deduced amino acid sequence corresponding to the MBP section of the hprepro-MBPH transcript showed a marked reduction in the number of positively charged amino acids. This marked basicity difference, the transcript's high abundance, hMBP's association with various health and disease processes, and the possible contribution of hMBPH to previously recognized hMBP activities prompted us to further characterize this MBP-like molecule. We report here the identification, isolation, and characterization of this novel, highly divergent homolog of hMBP. Differentiating eosinophils were produced in vitro by stimulation of umbilical cord precursor cells (UCC) with recombinant human IL-5, a generous gift from Schering-Plow Research Institute, Kenilworth, NJ, essentially as described before (20Popken-Harris P.

Cytokine. 1991; 3: 350-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Eosinophil differentiation was monitored with cyanide-resistant peroxidase staining (22Ten R.M. Pease L.R. McKean D.J. Bell M.P. Gleich G.J. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1757-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), a marker for eosinophil peroxidase. By days 10–12, 60–100% of the cultured cells stained positive for eosinophil peroxidase. Cells from the recombinant human IL-5-stimulated cultures were pelleted and lysed in 4 m guanidine thiocyanate at 107 cells/ml. Lysates were stored at −70 °C until processing. Total RNA was extracted using standard CsCl methods (24Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1, Chapter 4. Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997Google Scholar). One hundred micrograms of pooled total RNA was utilized for construction of a cDNA library for Transcript Image generation. Total RNA, prepared from recombinant human IL-5-stimulated UCC populations following guanidinium lysis as described above, was subjected to DNase treatment, and polyadenylated RNA was isolated using Qiagen Oligotex (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Polyadenylated RNAs were converted to cDNA using the SuperScript Plasmid System (Life Technologies, Inc.), where the plasmid cloning vector was a polylinker-modified pSPORT. Prior to cloning, cDNAs were size-fractionated on Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Following transformation, individual colonies were picked, and plasmid DNA was released and purified using the REAL Prep 96 plasmid kit (Qiagen). Sequencing of cDNA using ABI 377 sequencers and standard ABI sequencing protocols was performed on 15,000 plasmid DNAs. All plasmid sequences were screened to identify putative cDNA inserts followed by iterative screening of these cDNAs against public nucleic acid and protein data bases for sequence identification. This process yielded a total of 8,146 useable sequences (i.e.nonmitochondrial and nonribosomal sequences). The number of times a unique cDNA was identified was recorded, resulting in a steady state transcription profile or image, and referred to as a Transcript Image. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers specific for the “pro” section of hprepro-MBP or hprepro-MBPH were designed using Oligo software (National Biosciences, Inc., Plymouth, MN). The hprepro-MBP primer pair 5′-TCTGAGACTTCCACCTTTGAGACC-3′ and 5′-GTTTTTGTCCACCATATCTGGCAC-3′ and hprepro-MBPH primer pair 5′-AGAATGATGCCCCCCATCTG-3′ and 5′-CACTGGAAGTCCTTGTCTAAGGCAG-3′ were expected to produce PCR products of 198 base pairs and 214 base pairs in length, respectively. Template cDNAs from human tissues (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were tested for the presence of hprepro-MBP or hprepro-MBPH sequence: brain, bone marrow, colon, heart, kidney, lymph node, liver, lung, ovary, peripheral blood leukocytes, pancreas, placenta, prostate, skeletal muscle, small intestine, spleen, testis, thymus, and tonsil. The Expand PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used with cycling parameters of initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min, 10 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s followed by 28 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s with an additional 20 s each cycle and a final extension time of 7 min at 72 °C. PCR products were visualized with ethidium bromide in 2% agarose gels. The full-length cDNA sequence of hprepro-MBPH was used to search for matching sequences (>95% identity) in Incyte's assembled data base. This data base was composed of Transcript Image data derived from multiple tissue samples divided into 20 distinct tissue categories (see Table III). The total number of sequence matches (i.e. “absolute abundance”) and the distribution of matches across the distinct tissue samples composing a given tissue category (i.e. “found in”) were recorded.Table IIIElectronic Northern tissue expression profile of human prepro-MBPHTissue categoryTotal clones sequencedFound inaNumber of distinct tissue samples that contains one or more sequences matching that of hprepro-MBPH per total number of tissue samples composing a tissue category.Absolute abundancebTotal number of sequences matching that of hprepro-MBPH in a given tissue category.Cardiovascular system185,1780 /500Connective tissue70,5950 /260Digestive system126,0200 /810Embryonic structures59,2260 /160Endocrine system156,1930 /390Exocrine glands184,5520 /420Genitalia, female213,6540 /570Genitalia, male304,0360 /870Germ cells5,8430 /40Hemic and immune system458,6081 /98133cThe greater absolute abundance versus that listed in Table I, i.e. 93, was due to less stringent screening of Transcript Image sequence data used in this electronic Northern analysis.

Open table in a new tab A peptide corresponding to a segment of the N-terminal sequence of hMBPH (see below; Fig. 1) with minimal homology to hMBP was synthesized and covalently coupled to Imject maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce) in the Mayo Protein Core Facility (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin peptide (approximately 50 μg) in RIBI adjuvant (RIBI ImmunoChem Research, Hamilton, MT) was injected intraperitoneally into five BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) monthly for 3 months followed by a final intravenous injection of approximately 50 μg of keyhole limpet hemocyanin peptide in saline 3 days prior to harvesting the spleens (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 207-213Google Scholar). Spleen cells were fused to FO myeloma cells and cultured as described previously (25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Kikuchi M.T. Gleich G.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1472-1480PubMed Google Scholar). Conditioned media were screened for reactivity to the immunizing peptide using the F.A.S.T. system (Falcon Assay Screening Test; Becton Dickinson, Oxnard, CA) with the immunizing peptide covalently coupled to125I-labeled Imject maleimide-activated bovine serum albumin (Pierce) (27McConahey P.J. Dixon F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Antibodies were selected for specificity and avidity using peptide alone immobilized on Immulon-4 Removawell microtiter wells (Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA). Hybridomas were subcloned using standard limiting dilution methods. Verification of monoclonal antibody reactivity was further assessed by slot blot analysis of immunizing peptide bound to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Ultimately, one hybridoma, J191–12H11, was cultured, and the antibody was purified using a POROS 20 G - Protein G column (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Eosinophils (about 1 × 1011 cells/patient, final purity of 90%) were collected by cytapheresis of patients with the hypereosinophilic syndrome (28Spry C.J.F. Davies J. Tai P.C. Olsen E.G.J. Oakley C.M. Goodwin J.F. Q. J. Med. 1983; 52: 1-22PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were further processed to isolate eosinophil granules and granule proteins, as described earlier (29Durack D.T. Ackerman S.J. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5165-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 30Gleich G.J. Loegering D.A. Mann K.G. Maldonado J.E. J. Clin.

Fractions (1 ml each) from the Sephadex G-50 column were probed for hMBPH and hMBP with monoclonal antibodies J191–12H11 and J6–8A4, respectively, by Western blotting essentially as described previously (26Popken-Harris P. McGrogan M. Loegering D.A. Checkel J.L. Kubo H. Thomas L.L. Moy J.N. Sottrup-Jensen L. Snable J.L. Kikuchi M.T. Gleich G.J. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1472-1480PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions containing hMBPH were pooled and refractionated on Sephadex G-50. Fractions positive for hMBPH with J191–12H11 and negative for hMBP with J6–8A4 by Western blotting and showing a single band by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) staining were pooled, concentrated, and stored at −20 °C as purified hMBPH. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of hMBPH and hMBP were analyzed by Edman degradation microsequencing with the PE/Applied Biosystems 492 Procise Protein Sequencing System (Perkin-Elmer Corp./Applied Biosystems Division) using pulsed liquid chemistry in the Mayo Protein Core Facility. Data were collected and analyzed with PE/Applied Biosystems model 610 Sequencing Software. The desalted protein samples were absorbed to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes with the PE/Applied Biosystems ProSorb cartridges before sequencing. A MAGIC 2000 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources Inc., Auburn, CA) fitted with a C8 column (50 × 0.5 mm; Michrom Bioresources Inc.) in series with a Finnigan MAT 900 double sector mass spectrometer (Bremer, Germany) fitted with a position- and time-resolved ion counter array detector was used to analyze purified hMBPH and hMBP. A 15-min gradient from 5 to 60% mobile phase B (89.5% acetonitrile, 7% water, 3% n-propanol, 0.5% acetic acid, 0.02% trifluoroacetic acid) in mobile phase A (2% acetonitrile, 97.5% water, 0.5% acetic acid, 0.018% trifluoroacetic acid) at a flow rate of 30 μl/min was utilized, giving an estimated gradient delay of 2 min. Effluent from the HPLC column was interfaced with the MS via a fused silica capillary (180-μm outer diameter × 25 μm inner diameter; Polymicro Technologies, Phoenix, AZ) passed coaxially through the inner bore of the electrospray needle. This needle was biased at 4.8 kV with respect to the accelerating voltage of 5 kV. Ionization was by positive ion electrospray with N2sheath gas flow to assist nebulization (1.5 liters/min). The mass spectrometer was operated over a mass range of 500–2500 Da at a scan rate of 5 s/decade. The position- and time-resolved ion counter detector was operated at a microchannel voltage of 820 V and a mass window of 8%. For alkylation of protein prior to mass spectrometric analysis, hMBPH and hMBP were incubated with iodoacetamide (IA; 20 mol of IA/mol of protein) in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 30 min. Similarly, reduction and alkylation were performed with dithiothreitol (20 mol/mol of protein) in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0 at 37 °C for 30 min followed by the addition of IA (40 mol/mol of protein) and continued incubation for 30 min. Purified hMBPH or hMBP in acetate buffer (25 mm sodium acetate, 150 mmNaCl, pH 4.2) with an absorbance at 280 nm of about 0.75 was centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 20 min just prior to the addition of the supernatant to a 1 × 1-cm quartz cuvette. An absorbance spectrum (250–400 nm) was then acquired on a dual beam Varian CARY 2200 spectrophotometer with acetate buffer as the blank. Three 50-μl samples were taken directly from the cuvette using three separate calibrated pipettors. A portion of each sample was then subjected to amino acid analysis in triplicate with postcolumn ninhydrin detection to quantitate the total mass of protein present. Briefly, the proteins were vapor-hydrolyzed with 6 mhydrochloric acid and 1% phenol for 24 h under vacuum at 110 °C. The hydrolysates were analyzed on a Beckman 6300 amino acid analyzer (Beckman Instruments) modified with the Pickering Laboratories column, Na+ buffers (pH 3.28, 4.25, 6.40), and Trione ninhydrin reagent (Pickering Laboratories, Mountain View, CA). Norleucine was the internal standard, and a sample of standardized bovine serum albumin (Pierce) was the hydrolysis control. Extinction coefficients for hMBPH and hMBP were subsequently calculated from their respective absorbance values at 280 nm corrected for light scattering (32Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) (correction resulted in a 3–4% reduction in the uncorrected absorbance values at 280 nm), and their average protein concentrations were determined from the three 50-μl samples. The S.D. of the average protein concentrations for hMBPH and hMBP were used to estimate the errors of their respective calculated extinction coefficients. Theoretical molar extinction coefficients (ε) for hMBPH and hMBP were also calculated using the equation ε (m−1cm−1) = 5540(n Trp) + 1480(n Tyr) + 134(n S–S) (32Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), where n Trp, n Tyr, and n S-S are the numbers of tryptophans, tyrosines, and disulfide linkages within the protein of interest (hMBPH: 7 Trp, 5 Tyr, and 2 S–S; hMBP: 7 Trp, 6 Tyr, and 2 S–S). Cytotoxic effects of hMBPH and hMBP were tested using human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells (CCL-243; American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) essentially as described earlier. 3H. Kubo, D. A. Loegering, Y. Tohda, J. Bankers-Fulbright, C. R. Weiler, H. Nakajima, L. L. Thomas, C. R. Adolphson, and G. J. Gleich, submitted for publication. Twenty-five microliters of these leucine-starved K562 cells (2.5 × 104 cells) were added in triplicate to a Costar half-area, flat bottom 96-well plate (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) followed by the addition of 2.5 μl of buffer or protein solution. The plate was incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 h, and then 0.1 μm [14C]leucine was added. After a final incubation at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 h, 100 μl of 0.1% SDS was added to each well; the contents were mixed; and the solution was transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. A wash of 100 μl of 0.1% SDS was added to each well, mixed, and transferred to its respective tube containing the first wash. Less than 1% of the radioactive counts remained in the well. Bovine serum albumin (100 μl of a 0.1% solution) was added to each tube followed by 300 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate protein (34Sivaraman T. Kumar T.K.S. Jayaraman G. Yu C. J.

Voltage-dependent calcium channels are the primary triggers for electrically evoked release of chemical transmitters. Understanding the mechanisms underlying their regulation is central to the development of a molecular picture of key events in neuronal signaling. Calcium channels are well known targets for inhibition by receptor-G protein pathways, and multiple forms of inhibition have been described (1Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 187-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 2Beech D.J. Bernheim L. Hille B. Neuron. 1992; 8: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The termination of the response or desensitization represents a main mechanism for controlling synaptic strength in an activity-dependent manner. Much of the knowledge about agonist-dependent desensitization comes from studies of ionotropic receptors such as GABAergic 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; GAIP, Gα interacting protein; KS, kinetic slowing; NE, norepinephrine; RGS, regulators of G protein signaling; SSI, steady-state inhibition; RT, reverse transcription; PCR, polymerase chain reaction and glutamatergic receptors. In addition to the ionotropic receptor-mediated fast synaptic transmission, signaling in the nervous system relies heavily on G protein-coupled receptors for more prolonged and sustained synaptic action. Norepinephrine (NE) inhibits N-type (ω-conotoxin GVIA-sensitive) Ca2+ channels in embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons through two pathways (3Diversé-Pierluissi M. Dunlap K.

Low concentrations of NE (<10 μm) produce reductions in N current with no changes in its time course of activation (termed “steady-state inhibition” (SSI)), whereas higher NE concentrations (>10 μm) evoke a slowing of the activation kinetics termed “kinetic slowing” (KS) (3Diversé-Pierluissi M.

This inhibition of the N-type calcium current is a transient phenomenon as the response desensitizes under prolonged exposure to 100 μm NE (6Diversé-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H.

The onset of desensitization in DRG neurons requires receptor-mediated G protein activation. 2M. A. Diversé-Pierluissi, unpublished observation. Although both KS and SSI require the activation of the same G protein-coupled receptor kinase, GRK3 (6Diversé-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Dunlap K.

Recently, a new family of proteins, regulators of G protein signaling (RGS), has been found to play a role in desensitization (7Arshavsky V.Y. Pugh E.N.

Nature. 1996; 383: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Experiments presented in this paper show that RGS proteins selectively alter the time course of desensitization of the two signaling pathways. Although recent reports have shown that there is selectivity in the actions of RGS proteins on Gq- and Gi-mediated pathways (17Huang C. Hepler J.R. Gilman A.G. Mumby S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6159-6163Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Shuey D.J. Betty M. Jones P.G. Khawaja X.Z. Cockett M.I. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1964-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), little is known about the ability of these proteins to interact with different members of the Gi subfamily. Here we show that RGS4 and GAIP selectively interact with the Gi- and Go-mediated pathways. RGS4 alters the rate of desensitization of the Gi- and voltage-independent inhibition of calcium current whereas GAIP accelerates the rate of desensitization of the Go- and voltage-dependent inhibition of calcium current. Furthermore, our data suggest that a domain outside of the RGS domain might be responsible for the G protein subtype selectivity in RGS actions. Embryonic chick sensory neurons were grown in culture as described previously (3Diversé-Pierluissi M. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1993; 10: 753-760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Dorsal root ganglia were dissected from 11–12-day-old embryos. Cells were plated at a density of ∼50,000 cells per collagen-coated 35-mm tissue culture dish and studied between 1 and 3 days in vitro. Whole-cell recordings were performed as described previously (19Horn R. Marty A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 145-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1462) Google Scholar). For extracellular application, agents were diluted into standard extracellular saline and applied via a wide-bore (140 μm inner diameter) pipette, which exchanges solutions with subsecond kinetics. For the experiments presented in this report, calcium current has been corrected for rundown by measuring calcium current as a function of time in control cells without transmitter. Cells used for experiments exhibited a rundown of the current of <1%/min. Data were filtered at 3 kHz, acquired at 10–20 kHz, and analyzed using PulseFit (HEKA) and Igor (WaveMetrics) on a Macintosh computer. Strong depolarizing conditioning pulses (to 80 mV) that precede test pulses (to 0 mV) reverse NE-induced KS without affecting SSI. Such conditioning pulses have no effect on control currents recorded in the absence of NE. During the application of the transmitter, test pulse currents measured before and after the conditioning pulse are subtracted to yield the KS component. Test pulses measured following the conditioning pulse are subtracted from control currents (measured in the absence of NE) to yield the SSI component. Integration of these two currents gives measurements of total charge entry carried by the two modulatory components. Rat pGBT9 Gαo1(originally a gift from E. Neer (9De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A.

Bacteria pellets were resuspended in 25 mm Tris (pH 8), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 1% Tween 20, and 200 μg/ml lyzozyme for GAIP/RGS4 constructs, or 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 2 mmMgCl2, 30 μm AlCl3, 20 mm NaF, 100 μm GDP, 1% Tween 20, and 200 μg/ml lyzozyme for Gαo1. After sonication, 100,000 × g supernatants were applied to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetate resin (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), and histidine-tagged proteins were eluted with 250 mmimidazole. 250 nmGαo1 was loaded with [γ-32P]GTP (1 μm) for 40 min in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether (C12E10) at 30 °C. The temperature was then reduced to 4 °C. All GTP hydrolysis measures were performed under single turnover conditions at 4 °C (15Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Reactions were started by addition of RGS mix consisting of 15 mmMgSO4, 150 μm GTP, and 2 μm(final concentrations) of each GAIP/RGS4 polypeptide. 50-μl aliquots were removed at the indicated times and added in 750 μl of a 5% (w/v) charcoal slurry in 50 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 2.0). Zero time point was obtained by adding 30 μl of [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Gαo1 in charcoal slurry. After vortex, 20 μl of RGS mix was added. Tubes containing charcoal slurry were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 12,000 × g. 400-μl aliquots were counted by Cerenkov scintillation. Antibodies against RGS4 N terminus, RGS4 C terminus, GAIP N terminus, and RGS10 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Full-length GAIP antibodies were raised and characterized as described by De Vries et al. (20De Vries L. Elenko E. McCaffery J.M. Fischer T. Hubler L. McQuistan T. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Antibodies against RGS2 and RGS12 were a kind gift of Dr. David P. Siderovski (Amgen Institute, Toronto, Canada). Total RNA was isolated from 11–12-day-old embryonic chick DRG neurons using TRIzol (Life Technologies Inc). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using FastTrack (Invitrogen). Primers for RGS4 were a kind gift from Dr. David P. Siderovski. The PCRs were performed with a “touch-down/touch-up” annealing temperature protocol described by Siderovski and colleagues (12Snow B.E. Antonio L. Suggs S. Gutstein H.B. Siderovski D.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 233: 770-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PCR products were gel-purified and subcloned into a TA cloning vector, pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). Chicken RGS4 and GAIP RT-PCR fragments were excised from pCR2.1 by EcoRI digestion and radioactively labeled by random hexanucleotide extension (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's suggested procedure. 5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were loaded per lane and separated by electrophoresis on denaturing formaldehyde 1% agarose gels. Hybridization was done in 50% formamide, 6× SSC, 10× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA in a hybridization oven (Robbins Scientific, Mountain View, CA) at 42 °C. The blots were washed sequentially with 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS at 25 °C, 1× SSC, 0.25% SDS at 42 °C, and 0.2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at 65 °C, and exposed to film. We generated functional recombinant proteins in E. colitagged on their N termini with a hexahistidine epitope for purification purposes. GAIP-(1–217), RGS4, and GAIP-(79–206) were able to speed up basal GTPase activity of Gαo1 triggered with 15 mm MgSO4 (Fig.1 B). These results are in agreement with previous reports (14Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 15Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). To test the effects of these RGS proteins, calcium currents were recorded from the cell bodies of embryonic chick sensory neurons 1–3 days after plating. Application of 100 μm NE induced a 55 ± 7% decrease in calcium current. To separate the voltage-dependent (KS) from the voltage-independent (SSI) component, we used a +80-mV, 15-ms pulse with a 5-ms interval between the conditioning and test pulses (5Luebke J.I. Dunlap K. Pfluegers. Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1994; 428: 499-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This inhibition is transient as the response is maximally desensitized by 2 min. The NE-mediated KS and SSI desensitize at different rates (6Diversé-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 579-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). In yeast two-hybrid experiments GAIP interacts more effectively with Gαi3 and Gαo than with Gαi2(9De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This suggested that in chick sensory neurons, GAIP might exhibit differential effects on Go-mediated KS and Gi-mediated SSI. Using tight-seal, whole-cell recording, DRG neuron calcium current was measured before and during prolonged exposure to transmitter. Currents were evoked by a 10-ms voltage step from −80 to 0 mV every 10 s. Cells were equilibrated with control or RGS-containing (0.2–200 nm) internal solution for 10 min prior to transmitter application; calcium current as a function of time was measured to check for any agonist-independent effect that the recombinant protein might have. In control cells (n = 16), NE inhibited N-type calcium current by an average of 40% (25% SSI and 15% KS). In GAIP-treated cells, the KS component was eliminated (n = 14), whereas SSI was unaffected (Fig.2 A). Inclusion of GAIP in the recording solution blocked the Go-mediated pathway. This result was corroborated in experiments in which GABA was used. GABA via GABAB receptors induces kinetic slowing and steady-state inhibition of voltage-dependent calcium channels in chick DRG neurons by pathways mediated through Go (4Diversé-Pierluissi M. Goldsmith P.K. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1994; 14: 191-200Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (119) Google Scholar). GAIP blocked the GABAB-mediated inhibition of the N-type calcium current (Fig. 2 A). Inclusion of GAIP in the recording internal solution did not have an effect on the magnitude of the basal calcium current or the percentage of rundown of calcium current over time. Experiments performed using more frequent depolarizations (every 2 s) revealed that the apparent block of the response is a result of an alteration in the time course of the NE-mediated inhibition of calcium. In control cells (Fig. 2 B), NE inhibits the calcium current and the effect persists during the experiment for the first 40 s in the presence of agonist. Cells that contained GAIP in the internal recording solution exhibited a maximal recovery in 8 s despite the continued presence of 100 μm NE. This accounts for the lack of response observed when the cells were depolarized every 10 s. Lower concentrations of the protein (2 nm) accelerated the rate of desensitization without altering the magnitude of the response. GAIP failed to alter the time course of the Gi-mediated response or onset of the inhibition. It has been shown that RGS4 can alter the GTPase activity of both Gi and Gq. Inclusion of 200 nm RGS4 in the internal solution selectively accelerated the time course of desensitization of the NE-SSI without altering the KS component. Lower concentrations of RGS4 were also effective in altering the time course of desensitization (Fig. 3 B). Recombinant RGS2, RGS12, and RGS14 (0.1–200 nm) did not have an effect on the magnitude of the response or in the magnitude, extent, or rate of desensitization. A fusion protein containing the RGS core domain of GAIP-(79–206) was used to test whether this domain of the protein was sufficient to alter the time course of desensitization. The fusion protein was introduced into the intracellular environment through passive diffusion from the recording pipette. The core domain of GAIP altered both NE-mediated KS and SSI (Fig. 2 C). The rate of desensitization of both inhibitory components was accelerated under these experimental conditions (data not shown). The selectivity of GAIP was lost when the N terminus and C terminus of the protein were removed. To test whether RGS4 or GAIP plays a role in the desensitization of NE-mediated KS and SSI under physiological conditions, we employed antibodies raised against these proteins to inhibit the endogenous proteins. The antibodies were introduced into sensory neurons through the recording pipette solution and allowed to diffuse into the cytoplasm. Cells were treated with 100 μm NE after 10–12 min. The magnitude of the N-type inhibition, the extent, and the time course of desensitization were compared with cells equilibrated for an equal amount of time with normal internal recording solution. Antibodies raised against RGS4 N terminus or C terminus (20 ng/μl) slowed the time course of desensitization of NE-mediated SSI (TableI). The KS component was unaffected. Antibodies raised against full-length GAIP or its N terminus (20 ng/μl) increased the half-time for desensitization of NE-mediated KS by a factor of 10. The antibodies did not alter the extent of desensitization. Whereas blocking RGS proteins had a profound effect on the rate of desensitization, no effect was observed on the onset of desensitization, as the initial time at which desensitization could be detected remained unchanged in control and antibody-treated cells. NE-mediated SSI and KS in cells microinjected with antibodies raised against RGS2, RGS12, and RGS10 were no different from control cells (Table I).Table IEffects of RGS antibodies on the rate of desensitization of NE-mediated steady-state inhibition and kinetic slowingAntibodyt 1/2Kinetic slowingSteady-state inhibitionControl60 ± 8100 ± 6RGS4 N terminus55 ± 9975 ± 18RGS4 C terminus61 ± 71000 ± 12GAIP full-length650 ± 15102 ± 7GAIP N terminus640 ± 1698 ± 7RGS12 (RGS domain)57 ± 397 ± 5RGS256 ± 5101 ± 7RGS1062 ± 6103 ± 6Values represent mean ± S.E. of five cells.

Two of the fragments exhibited a high degree of nucleotide and amino acid sequence identity with mammalian GAIP and RGS4, respectively (Fig.4, A and B). Northern blot analysis of embryonic chick RNA indicated that chick GAIP and RGS4 fragments hybridized at high stringency to transcripts in DRG neuron RNA that are comparable in size to their mammalian counterparts (9De Vries L.

Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). These data suggest that chick DRG neurons express RGS proteins similar to mammalian GAIP and RGS4. Recent reports have shed light on the functional roles of RGS proteins in the nervous system. RGS9 colocalizes with the other signaling components of the phototransduction machinery in the rod outer segment, and in vitro assays have shown that this RGS protein accelerates the rate of GTP hydrolysis of transducin (21He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). RGS8 coexpressed with a G protein-coupled receptor and a G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel accelerated the kinetics of onset and desensitization of the response (22Saitoh O. Kubo Y. Miyatani Y. Asano T. Nakata H. Nature. 1997; 390: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In hippocampal CA1 neurons, RGS4 blocks the glutamate receptor (GluR5)-mediated inhibition of K+ current by blocking Gq-mediated activation of phospholipase C (23Saugstad J.A. Marino M.J. Folk J.A. Hepler J.R. Conn P.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 905-913Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The question remains whether the RGS proteins can selectively alter transmitter responses mediated by a specific type of G protein. About nine different RGS domains have been sequenced by RT-PCR in embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons. 3M. Schiff, J. D. Jordan, and M. A. Diversé-Pierluissi, unpublished observation. The questions of why a cell needs multiple RGS proteins and whether there is selectivity in their action arise. Our experiments show that there is selectivity in the effects of RGS proteins and that this could potentially lead to differences in the desensitization of Gi- and Go-mediated pathways. We have shown that the endogenous RGS proteins exhibit selectivity, as blocking RGS4 and GAIP with specific antibodies in sensory neurons altered the rates of desensitization of Gi-mediated SSI and Go-mediated KS, respectively. The molecular basis for the selectivity of the RGS actions resides in a domain outside of the RGS box, as the RGS domain of GAIP alone did not discriminate between Gi- and Go-mediated pathways. Recent reports have shown that molecular domains outside of the RGS box might be important for the targeting or activity of RGS proteins. The localization of RGS4 to the plasma membrane and GAIP to intracellular membranes seems to be dependent on the N terminus of these molecules (20De Vries L. Elenko E. McCaffery J.M. Fischer T. Hubler L. McQuistan T. Watson N. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5584-5590Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recently, the N-terminal domain of RGS4 (and to a lesser degree, its C-terminal domain) was shown to be important for discrimination between specific receptor signaling complexes (25Zeng W. Xu X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Swistok S. Danho W. Yagaloff K.A. Fisher S.L. Ross E.M. Muallem S. Wilkie T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34687-34690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The N terminus of RGS12 contains a PDZ domain, which interacts with a chemokine receptor (26Snow B.E. Hall R.A. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Gilman A.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Siderovski D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17749-17755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and the C terminus of GAIP interacts with a novel PDZ domain containing protein (27De Vries L. Lou X. Zhao G. Zheng B. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 13: 12340-12345Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). These interactions might also contribute to their selectivity. Besides its potential role in membrane attachment via its cysteine string motif, the N-terminal domain of GAIP might also play an additional role in the selectivity of this RGS protein. The RGS box might also contribute to the selectivity. The RGS domains of GAIP and RGS4 are structurally very similar, but the conserved Asn-128 residue in RGS4 that makes closest contact to the Gαi1 subunit is present as Ser-156 in GAIP (28Tesmer J.J. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1998; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Although not yet tested, swapping these residues in both molecules might have effects on their selectivity of interaction with different G protein α subunits. An interesting observation derived from the experiments is that although RGS proteins play a role in determining the rate of desensitization, blockade by antibodies did not prevent desensitization. A plausible explanation is that another molecule is necessary for the onset of desensitization. We have previously shown that GRK3, a G protein-coupled receptor kinase plays a role in desensitization in embryonic chick sensory neurons (6Diversé-Pierluissi M. Inglese J. Stoffel R.H. Lefkowitz R.J. Dunlap K. Neuron. 1996; 16: 579-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Future experiments should address the roles of GRK3 and RGS proteins in the onset and kinetics of desensitization.

Removal of the binding site on the receptor, by mutation of Tyr1009 to Phe1009 (denoted Y1009F), led to loss of PDGF-stimulated phosphatase activity in cells expressing the mutated receptor, and these cells failed to form membrane edge ruffles and to migrate toward PDGF. Furthermore, treatment with phosphatase inhibitors phenylarsine oxide (PAO) and orthovanadate led to loss of PDGF-stimulated phosphatase activity and attenuated PDGF-stimulated migration of wild type PDGFR-β cells. Treatment of wild type PDGFR-β cells with combinations of PAO or orthovanadate and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 resulted in a synergistic inhibition of PDGFR-β-mediated cell migration. PDGF stimulation of wild type PDGFR-β cells led to induction of p125 focal adhesion kinase (FAK) activity at low concentrations of the growth factor and a decrease at higher concentrations. In the mutant Y1009F cells and in wild type PDGFR-β cells treated with PAO and orthovanadate, FAK activity was not increased in response to PDGF. These results suggest that SHP-2 activity is involved in regulation of FAK activity and thereby of cell migration through PDGFR-β, independently of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.

Migration of cells is an integral part of many different physiological and pathological processes. Embryonic development, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumor spreading require cell motility. Signal transduction through growth factor receptors with intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity leads to induction of directed cellular migration, chemotaxis. Activation of the tyrosine kinase, upon growth factor binding and dimerization of receptors, results in receptor autophosphorylation (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4569) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues present binding sites for signal transduction molecules containing one or two copies of so called Src homology 2 domains, a conserved stretch of about 100 amino acid residues, which mediates the interaction with the phosphotyrosine and the following 3–6 C-terminal amino acid residues (2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Binding of signal transduction molecules to the receptor leads to initiation of signaling cascades, through activation of enzymatic activities intrinsic to or associated with the signal transduction molecules. The signaling cascade is eventually established as a cellular response, such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation.

Yang-Feng T.L. Daniel T.O. Tremble P.M. Chen E.Y. Ando M.E. Harkins R.N. Francke U. Friend V.A. Ullrich A. Williams W.T.

A. 1989; 86: 4917-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The receptors are similar in structure, with an extracellular part organized in five immunoglobulin-like domains, a single transmembrane stretch and an intracellular part containing the kinase domain. The kinase domain is interrupted by the insertion of a noncatalytic kinase insert. More than 10 autophosphorylation sites have so far been identified in the PDGF β-receptor (6Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32023-32026Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several of these have been shown to interact with Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins, which have been implicated in transduction of signaling cascades leading to cellular migration. Thus, two autophosphorylation sites (Tyr740 and Tyr751) in the kinase insert of the receptor bind the regulatory subunit (p85) of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase. PI 3-kinase activity has been shown to be a prerequisite for PDGF-induced cellular migration (7Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). The two autophosphorylation sites in the carboxyl-terminal tail (Tyr1009 and Tyr1021) mediate binding of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), which is implicated in regulation of chemotaxis (8Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 9Hansen K. Johnell M. Siegbahn A. Rorsman C. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. Ronnstrand L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5299-5313Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylated Tyr1009 binds the phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 (also denoted PTP1D, Syp, and SH-PTP2) (10Kazlauskas A. Feng G.S. Pawson T. Valius M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6939-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Lechleider R.J. Sugimoto S. Bennett A.M. Kashishian A.S. Cooper J.C. Shoelson S.E. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21478-21481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SHP-2 activity has been implicated in cytoskeletal organization (12Ouwens D.M. Mikkers H.M. van der Zon G. Stein-Gerlach C.M. Ullrich A. Maassen J.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which may indicate a function for SHP-2 in cellular migration. Numerous studies have shown that SHP-2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in growth factor-stimulated cells and stably associated with activated growth factor receptors (13Yi T. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3350-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 14Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 has been reported to induce its catalytic activity (15Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), although mutation of the phosphorylatable tyrosine residues in SHP-2 does not preclude its activation (16Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). SHP-2 may act as a negative regulator of PDGF receptor function, by dephosphorylating the receptor or its cognate substrates (17Klinghoffer R.A. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22208-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). On the other hand, SHP-2 is also implicated in positive regulation of PDGF function, since tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 presents a binding site for the adaptor protein Grb2, which is known to mediate Ras activation through complex formation with the nucleotide exchange factor Sos (16Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 18Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of Grb2/Sos binding to SHP-2 is not clear, and mutation of the Grb-2-binding site on SHP-2 does not interfere with PDGF-induced Erk-2 activation (16Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The recent report on targeted inactivation of the SHP-2 gene showed that loss of SHP-2 was embryonally lethal and led to failure of development of the vascular system (19Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The reason for vascular failure in these animals is not clear, but it is noteworthy that migration is critical for the development of the vascular system (vasculogenesis) as well as for formation of new vessels from pre-existing ones (angiogenesis) (20Stokes C.L. EXS (Basel). 1992; 61: 118-124PubMed Google Scholar, 21Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4006) Google Scholar). In this work, we have used PDGF-stimulated porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells expressing the PDGF β-receptor or receptor mutants Y1009F and Y1021F, to examine the potential role for SHP-2 in migration. PAE cells expressing a Y1009F mutant PDGF β-receptor, which lacks the SHP-2 binding site, failed to migrate toward PDGF. Moreover, treatment with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors PAO and vanadate led to attenuation of migration of PDGF-BB-stimulated PAE cells expressing the wild type PDGFR-β. Our data indicate a role for SHP-2 in migration via a pathway that acts parallel to the PI 3-kinase pathway and involves regulation of focal adhesion kinase activity. PAE cells expressing the wild type PDGFR-β or mutant PDGFR-β Y1009F and Y1021F have been described previously (22Ronnstrand L. Mori S. Arvidsson A.K. Eriksson A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3911-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and antibiotics at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For starvation, cells were kept in serum-free medium supplemented with 0.1% serum bovine albumin. The rabbit antiserum PDGFR-3, specifically recognizing the PDGFR-β, has been described earlier (23Claesson-Welsh L. Eriksson A. Moren A. Severinsson L. Ek B. Ostman A. Betsholtz C. Heldin C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3476-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Anti-SHP-2 monoclonal antibody and anti-Grb2 rabbit antiserum were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY20 and the monoclonal anti-FAK (2A7) antibody were from Transduction Laboratories. The rabbit antiserum against PLC-γ, raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a part of human PLC-γ was kindly provided by Dr. Lars Rönnstrand (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Phosphatidylinositol was from Lipid Products (Redhill, Surrey, United Kingdom). Wortmannin, LY294002, phenylarsine oxide, and sodium orthovanadate were purchased from Sigma. PDGF-BB was purchased from PeproTech Inc. Serum-starved cells were treated with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB at 37 °C for 8 min, rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mmNa3VO4 and 1 mm dithiothreitol and lysed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% TX-100, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 1% aprotinin (Trasylol, Bayer), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Cell lysates were incubated with rabbit antiserum or monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Stockholm, Sweden) for 30 min at 4 °C. The samples were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.2m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.5 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 2% β-mercaptoethanol) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Samples were then electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C Extra; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); the filter was blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS at 4 °C overnight and probed with specific antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the filter was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (sheep, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1:1000); immune complexes were visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were reprobed after removal of the first probe by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 55 °C. After PDGF-BB stimulation, the cells were lysed, and immunoprecipitation was performed with PDGFR-3 antiserum or anti-SHP-2 antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to kinase assays by incubation in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MnCl2, and 2 mmMgCl2, in the presence of 0.5 μCi of [γ32-P]ATP for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis the gel was treated in 2% glutaraldehyde to fix the proteins to the gel and then with 0.5m KOH at 55 °C for 45 min, to hydrolyze phosphorylation on serine. The gel was dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The assay was performed in a mini-Boyden chamber as described (24Auerbach R. Auerbach W. Polakowski I. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 51: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) using micropore nitrocellulose filters (8 μm thick, 8-μm pore) coated with type-1 collagen solution at 100 μg/ml (Vitrogen 100; Collagen Corp.). Cells were trypsinized and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml in serum-free medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. The cell suspension was placed in the upper chamber and 0.25% bovine serum albumin in serum-free medium without or with various concentrations of PDGF-BB placed below the filter in the lower chamber. For each set of experiments, random migration in the presence of serum-free medium containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin served as control and is referred to as 100% migration. All experiments were performed in triplicates for every concentration of PDGF-BB. The assays were read in blind. Anti-PDGFR-β immunoprecipitates immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads were washed twice with lysis buffer (see “Immunoprecipitation”) without vanadate and twice in the assay buffer containing 25 mmimidazole (pH 7.5), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.05% Triton X-100. The reaction mixture contained the immobilized immune complexes (60 μl), assay buffer without Triton X-100 (55 μl), and 32P-labeled Src optimal peptide (5 μl), the sequence of which is AEEEIYGEFEAKKKK (kindly provided by Arne Östman (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research)). After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 290 μl of an acidic charcoal mixture containing 0.9m HCl, 90 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm NaH2PO4, and 4% (w/v) Norit A. After centrifugation at 12.000 × g for 10 min, released Pi present in the supernatant was determined by scintillation counting. The assay did not work well when using anti-SHP-2 immunoprecipitated material or when many samples were processed simultaneously. Cells were grown in 24-well plates to subconfluency. They were washed in inositol-free Ham's F-12 medium and then incubated with 0.5 ml of inositol-free Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% fetal calf serum and 2 μCi/ml of [2-3H]myoinositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 24 h. Following labeling, cells were washed in Hanks‘/Hepes buffer at 37 °C for 20 min. Cells were then preincubated in 0.25 ml of Hanks‘/Hepes buffer containing 20 mm LiCl for 15 min at 37 °C before stimulation with PDGF-BB at the indicated concentrations for 30 min. Stimulations were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of acidified ice-cold methanol (methanol/HCl, 99:1 (v/v)), and samples were extracted on ice. Formation of total inositol phosphates was determined by ion exchange chromatography on Dowex AG1-X8 (formate form, 100–200 mesh, Bio-Rad) as described previously (25Briscoe C.P. Martin A. Cross M. Wakelam M. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Actin reorganization and membrane ruffling were analyzed essentially as described by Mellströmet al. (26Mellström K. Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 177: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips in six-well plates. Quiescent subconfluent cells were stimulated for 15 min at 37 °C with 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB. The cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde (Merck) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. The coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin in PBS (0.66 μg/ml; Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature and then washed three times with PBS. For examination by fluorescent microscopy, coverslips were covered with antifade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). PI 3-kinase activity was measuredin vitro, using anti-receptor antiserum for immunoprecipitation from cell lines pretreated or not with phosphatase inhibitors and stimulated with or without PDGF-BB. The immobilized immunoprecipitates were used for lipid kinase reactions using phosphatidylinositol as an exogenous substrate, and the reactions were analyzed as described by Wennström et al. (7Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar). Serum-starved cells pretreated or not with phosphatase inhibitors were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of PDGF-BB in the absence or presence of the drugs or vehicle (Me2SO) for the indicated time periods at 37 °C, rinsed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the anti-FAK monoclonal antibody 2A7, followed by incubation with rabbit anti-mouse Ig antiserum for an additional 45 min at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected using protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with FAK reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100). In vitro phosphorylation was performed for 15 min at room temperature in 25 μl of the reaction buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE in 7% linear polyacrylamide gels. After fixation in methanol/acetic acid, the gel was treated with 1 m KOH for 1 h at 55 °C, fixed again, dried, and exposed on RX films (Fuji). It has previously been shown that phosphorylated Tyr1009 and surrounding amino acid residues in the PDGFR-β present a binding site for SHP-2 (10Kazlauskas A. Feng G.S. Pawson T. Valius M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6939-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 11Lechleider R.J. Sugimoto S. Bennett A.M. Kashishian A.S. Cooper J.C. Shoelson S.E. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21478-21481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to characterize the role of SHP-2 in PDGF-induced cellular responses, we examined the properties of PAE cells expressing the wild type PDGFR-β, the mutant Y1009F (lacking the binding site for SHP-2), and, for comparison, the mutant Y1021F (lacking the binding site for PLC-γ). These cell lines have previously been reported to express similar numbers of receptors and to transduce mitogenic signals with similar efficiencies (22Ronnstrand L. Mori S. Arvidsson A.K. Eriksson A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3911-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows that PDGF-BB stimulation of the different cell lines led to similar -fold induction of receptor kinase activity. An immune complex kinase assay on SHP-2 immunoprecipitations showed that SHP-2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated and in complex with the PDGFR-β after PDGF-BB stimulation of PAE cells expressing the wild type receptor or the Y1021F mutant but not in cells expressing the Y1009F mutant PDGFR-β (Fig. 1 B). Immunoprecipitation of SHP-2, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 1 C), showed that the extent of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in the Y1009F cells was considerably reduced, as compared with the wild type PDGFR-β and Y1021F cells. The fact that some level of tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 remained in the Y1009F cells could indicate that there are additional binding sites for SHP-2 on the PDGFR-β. Although the sensitive immune complex kinase assay (Fig. 1 B) showed complex formation between the wild type PDGFR-β and SHP-2, we were not able to demonstrate such complexes in PDGF-treated, intact cells (Fig. 1 D). It has been shown previously that PLC-γ associates with Tyr(P)1021 and, to a lesser extent, with Tyr(P)1009 (22Ronnstrand L. Mori S. Arvidsson A.K. Eriksson A. Wernstedt C. Hellman U. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3911-3919Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). PDGF-BB stimulation of the different cell lines led to a 1.5-fold increase in formation of inositol phosphate (Fig. 1 E) in cells expressing the wild type PDGFR-β. In the Y1009F cells, inositol phosphate formation was significantly increased in response to PDGF stimulation, although not to the levels seen in the wild type receptor cells. In contrast, no inositol phosphate formation in response to PDGF stimulation could be detected in cells expressing the Y1021F mutant receptor. These data show that the Y1009F mutant receptor fails to associate with SHP-2 and mediate its tyrosine phosphorylation but that it is still able to mediate activation of PLC-γ. We examined the effect of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its catalytic activity. Phosphatase (PTP) activity was measured using anti-receptor immunoprecipitates from the different PAE cell lines treated or not with PDGF-BB. The receptor precipitates were incubated in the presence of a 32P-labeled synthetic phosphopeptide, which served as a substrate for the PTP activity. The PTP activity in unstimulated cells was used as a control and was set to 100%. As shown in Fig. 2 A, PDGF-BB-dependent increases in receptor-associated PTP activities in PAE cells expressing the wild type and Y1021F PDGFR-β were 322 ± 48% and 471 ± 71%, respectively. In contrast, the PDGF-BB-dependent increase in receptor-associated PTP activity in PAE cells expressing the Y1009F mutant was 120 ± 15%. These data indicate that SHP-2 is the dominating PDGF β-receptor-associated phosphotyrosine phosphatase. We next analyzed the effects of the phosphatase inhibitors PAO and orthovanadate on PDGFR-β-coupled PTP activity (Fig. 2 A). PAO has previously been shown to inhibit SHP-2 catalytic activity (27Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The PDGF-BB-induced increase in PTP activity in PDGFR-β immunoprecipitates was abolished (76 ± 7%) in PAO-treated PAE cells expressing the wild type receptor. In vanadate-treated PAE cells expressing the wild type receptor, PTP activity was 94 ± 9%. PAO and orthovanadate treatment for 4 h did not affect PDGF-BB-induced PDGFR-β kinase activity (Fig. 2 B). PAO and orthovanadate did also not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 or its expression levels (Fig. 3, A andB). Furthermore, it is well established that tyrosine-phosphorylated SHP-2 presents a binding site for Grb2, which still occurred in cells treated with the phosphatase inhibitors (Fig.3 C). These data show that receptor association and tyrosine phosphorylation, and thereby Grb2-binding, of SHP-2 remains after treatment of cells with PAO or orthovanadate. In contrast, PDGF β-receptor-associated phosphatase activity is reduced to that in unstimulated cells, indicating that the catalytic activity of SHP-2 is inhibited by PAO and vanadate. To examine the potential role of SHP-2 in PDGF-BB-stimulated chemotaxis, PAE cells expressing wild type, Y1009F, or Y1021F PDGFR-β were examined in a mini-Boyden chamber. Cells were loaded on one side of an 8-μm micropore nitrocellulose filter, and PDGF-BB at different concentrations was loaded on the other side. The ability of cells to move through the filter, toward the chemoattractant, was measured by Giemsa staining of the filter and counting of the cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, PDGF-BB stimulated a dose-dependent increase in cell migration, with a maximal migration occurring at 100 ng/ml PDGF-BB. PAE cells expressing the Y1021F mutant receptor also migrated efficiently but with a different dose optimum, 50 ng/ml PDGF-BB, as compared with the wild type receptor cells. In contrast, PAE cells expressing the Y1009F mutant PDGFR-β migrated only very inefficiently at high doses of PDGF-BB (Fig. 4 A). These results indicate that receptor binding of SHP-2 is a requirement for PDGF-BB-stimulated migration. We further examined the effects of PAO and orthovanadate on PDGF-BB-stimulated migration of PAE cells expressing the wild type PDGFR-β. As seen in Fig. 4 B, inclusion of PAO during the migration assay led to a dose-dependent decrease of PDGF-BB-stimulated (10 ng/ml) migration. Orthovanadate treatment also led to a decrease in PDGF-BB-stimulated migration (Fig. 4 C). 1 μm PAO and 300 μm orthovanadate efficiently suppressed PDGF-BB-stimulated and basal cellular migration (Fig. 4, B and C). The results are in accordance with a role for SHP-2 in PDGF-BB-stimulated migration. Cellular migration involves reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and veil-like actin-dense structures at the cell margin, denoted membrane edge ruffles, have previously been shown to be an integral part of cellular motility (20Stokes C.L. EXS (Basel). 1992; 61: 118-124PubMed Google Scholar). We examined PAE cells expressing the wild type PDGFR-β or the Y1009F and Y1021F mutants, respectively, for their ability to respond to PDGF-BB stimulation with formation of membrane edge ruffles. Fig. 5 shows that edge ruffles were formed both on cells expressing wild type PDGFR-β and on the Y1021F cells but that no ruffles were detected on the PDGF-BB-stimulated Y1009F cells. About 90% of the PDGF-treated wild type receptor and Y1021F receptor cells exhibited membrane edge ruffles, whereas 4% of the Y1009F cells showed these structures. These data agree with the notion that cellular migration is dependent on the formation of these membrane extensions. It has been shown previously that activation of PI 3-kinase is a prerequisite for PDGF-induced migration of cells (7Wennström S. Siegbahn A. Yokote K. Arvidsson A.K. Heldin C.H. Mori S. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 651-660PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In agreement, Fig. 4, D and E, show a dose-dependent decrease in PDGFR-β-mediated migration of cells toward PDGF-BB when treated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002. The efficiency of inhibition of migration of cells treated with LY294002 was less than for wortmannin-treated cells, possibly since LY294002 appears to be a more specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor. We tested whether activation of PI 3-kinase was disturbed in cells expressing the SHP-2 binding site mutant receptor and in cells treated with the phosphatase inhibitors. PAE cells expressing the Y1009F receptor, as well as wild type PDGFR-β cells treated or not with PAO, were stimulated with PDGF-BB and tested for PI 3-kinase activation in vitro. This was performed by immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor antiserum and incubation of the precipitate in the presence of PI and [γ-32P]ATP. Fig.6, A and B, shows that"
https://openalex.org/W2137993899,"Ying Yang 1 (YY1) is shown to bind to the proximal promoters of the genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase, and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. To investigate the potential effect of YY1 on the expression of SREBP-responsive genes, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter constructs under the control of promoters derived from either HMG-CoA synthase, FPP synthase, or the LDL receptor genes. The luciferase activity of each construct increased when HepG2 cells were incubated in lipid-depleted media or when the cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding mature sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1a. In each case, the increase in luciferase activity was attenuated by coexpression of wild-type YY1 but not by coexpression of mutant YY1 proteins that are known to be defective in either DNA binding or in modulating transcription of other known YY1-responsive genes. In contrast, incubation of cells in lipid-depleted media resulted in induction of an HMG-CoA reductase promoter-luciferase construct by a process that was unaffected by coexpression of wild-type YY1.Electromobility shift assays were used to demonstrate that the proximal promoters of the HMG-CoA synthase, FPP synthase, and the LDL receptor contain YY1 binding sites and that YY1 displaced nuclear factor Y from the promoter of the HMG-CoA synthase gene. We conclude that YY1 inhibits the transcription of specific SREBP-dependent genes and that, in the case of the HMG-CoA synthase gene, this involves displacement of nuclear factor Y from the promoter. We hypothesize that YY1 plays a regulatory role in the transcriptional regulation of specific SREBP-responsive genes. Ying Yang 1 (YY1) is shown to bind to the proximal promoters of the genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase, and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. To investigate the potential effect of YY1 on the expression of SREBP-responsive genes, HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with luciferase reporter constructs under the control of promoters derived from either HMG-CoA synthase, FPP synthase, or the LDL receptor genes.

In our continued efforts to elucidate the role of the transcriptional coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP) in sterol-regulated transcription, we noted that overexpression of the most amino-terminal domain of CBP (amino acids 1–451), as a Gal4 fusion protein, increased the expression of certain sterol-regulated reporter genes under conditions where the cells were incubated in the presence of excess sterols. 3J. Ericsson and P. A. Edwards, unpublished data. 3J. Ericsson and P. A. Edwards, unpublished data. A potential explanation for these results could be that overexpression of this domain of CBP interfered with the function of a transcriptional repressor. This prompted us to search for a CBP-dependent repressor that may regulate the expression of specific sterol-regulated genes. One potential candidate was the transcription factor Ying Yang 1 (YY1), which is known to have repressor functions and to interact with the amino-terminal domain of CBP (16Austen M. Lüscher B. Lüscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). A visual inspection of a number of promoters of sterol-regulated genes indicated that several of these contained potential YY1 binding sites (CCAT or ACAT), either overlapping or adjacent to binding sites for NF-Y, Sp1, or SREBP. Earlier studies show (4Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) that mutation of three of the four nucleotides in a CCAT motif in the FPP synthase promoter resulted in increased expression of an FPP synthase promoter-reporter gene. Because this CCAT motif was adjacent to SRE-3, the SREBP binding site that is important for sterol-regulated transcription of this gene (4Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), the result was consistent with the hypothesis that mutation of the CCAT sequence disrupted a cis element that normally functions to inhibit transcription of the FPP synthase gene. These observations prompted us to analyze the effect of YY1 on the transcription of various sterol-regulated genes. YY1, also known as δ, CF-1, UCRBP, NF-E1, FACT-1, CBF, LBF, NMP, and MAPF-1 (17Shrivastava A. Calame K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 24: 5151-5155Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 18Shi Y. Lee J.-S.

YY1 is expressed constitutively in many growing, differentiated, and growth-arrested cells (16Austen M. Lüscher B. Lüscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, recent studies demonstrated that YY1 protein levels decreased during skeletal and cardiac myocyte differentiation (24Walowitz J.L. Bradley M.E. Chen S. Lee T.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6656-6661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), consistent with an earlier proposal that down-regulation of YY1 was essential for the expression of the sarcomeric α-actin genes (25Lee T.-C. Shi Y. Schwartz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9814-9818Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 26Chen C.-Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 812-822PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier studies had demonstrated that YY1 inhibited muscle-restricted expression of the skeletal α-actin gene by excluding serum response factor from the serum response element in the proximal promoter of the α-actin gene (26Chen C.-Y. Schwartz R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 812-822PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, differential expression of the YY1 protein in myocytes is thought to affect both transcription of specific genes and cell differentiation. The current studies demonstrate that co-expression of YY1 results in transcriptional repression of specific SREBP-responsive genes, that the promoters of these genes contain binding motifs that are recognized by YY1, and that YY1 and NF-Y bind competitively to overlapping motifs in the promoter of the HMG-CoA synthase gene. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcription of specific sterol-regulated genes, including HMG-CoA synthase, FPP synthase, and the LDL receptor, is affected by YY1.

Cells were then lysed, and the luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined (4Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Lee B.C. Edwards P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Each experimental point was performed in duplicate (variation <10%), and each experiment was repeated two or more times with similar results. Recombinant SREBP-1a containing amino-terminal T7 and polyhistidine (His6) tags, recombinant histidine-tagged YY1, and recombinant histidine-tagged NF-Y A, B, and C were purified to homogeneity from Escherichia coli extracts by nickel chromatography (5Ericsson J.

YY1 was eluted from the nickel affinity column in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 200 mm imidazole) and dialyzed against buffer B (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Under these conditions, YY1 precipitated out of solution. The denatured protein was collected by centrifugation, and the pellet dissolved in 2 ml of buffer C (6 mguanidine-HCl, 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 1 mm PMSF, and 50 mm dithiothreitol) and heated at 50 °C for 2 h. The soluble protein, obtained after centrifugation, was dialyzed at 4 °C against 200 ml of buffer D (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.2 marginine-HCl, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm PMSF) for 24 h without stirring. YY1 was dialyzed for an additional 3 h against new buffer D with stirring and then for an additional 12 h using 4 changes of 300 ml of buffer E (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mmEGTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm zinc acetate, 1 mm PMSF, and 10% glycerol). The soluble YY1 protein obtained after centrifugation was stored at −70 °C. Equal volumes of recombinant NF-Y A, NF-Y B, and NF-Y C were premixed as described (9Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Mantovani R. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before addition to the radiolabeled DNA. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids that expressed wild-type or mutant YY1 protein. Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (9Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Mantovani R. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The soluble proteins (25 μg) were mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad), heated at 100 °C for 5 min, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filter was incubated with antibody to YY1 and the YY1-antibody complex identified using ECL as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Double-stranded DNA corresponding to nucleotides −324 to −225 of HMG-CoA synthase, −293 to −47 of FPP synthase, and −122 to −23 of the LDL receptor genes were end-labeled with 32P. The radiolabeled probes (20,000 cpm: 1.5 fmol) were incubated with the indicated amounts of recombinant YY1 and/or NF-Y in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) for 30 min at room temperature. One μg of poly(dI-dC) was included in each reaction to reduce nonspecific binding. In competition assays, an excess of the indicated double-stranded competitor DNA was added 5 min before the addition of the radiolabeled probe. The reaction products were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gel, vacuum-dried, and exposed to film at −70 C. The experiments of Fig. 1demonstrate that incubation of cells in sterol-depleted media resulted in increased expression of an HMG-CoA synthase promoter-reporter gene (pSYNSRE) (lane 1 versus 2). The induction was attenuated approximately 80% when cells were cotransfected with low levels of a plasmid encoding wild-type YY1 (Fig.1 A, lane 1 versus 3, 5, and7). In contrast, the induction of pSYNSRE, in response to cellular sterol depletion, was relatively unaffected when cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding mutant YY1 proteins YY1(Δ296–331) (Fig. 1 B) or YY1(Δ399–414) (Fig.1 C). YY1(Δ296–331) and YY1(Δ399–414), unlike wild-type YY1, are unable to bind DNA in vitro or to transactivate other reporter genes in vivo (16Austen M. Lüscher B. Lüscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In agreement with the report by Austen et al. (16Austen M. Lüscher B. Lüscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), Western blot assays, utilizing antibody to YY1 and extracts obtained from cells transiently transfected with either the wild-type or mutant YY1 constructs, demonstrated that similar levels of YY1 protein were expressed from these different constructs (Fig. 1 D). The experiments of Fig. 2 demonstrate that the induction of two other reporter genes (pFPPS and pLDLr), in response to cellular sterol depletion, was attenuated by coexpressed wild-type YY1 (Figs. 2, A–B, lanes 3 versus 1). The inhibitory effects of YY1 were specific because induction of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter-reporter construct (pRED) was unaffected by coexpressed YY1; indeed, coexpression of YY1 often resulted in a small increase in the expression of this promoter-reporter gene (Fig. 2C, lane 3 versus 1). The increased expression of pFPPS, pSYNSRE, and pLDLr that occurred when cells were incubated in sterol-depleted media was unaffected following cotransfection of the cells with the YY1 mutant constructs YY1(Δ296–331), YY1(Δ399–414) (Figs. 1 and 2), YY1(Δ334–414) (Fig. 3), or YY1(Δ154–199) (data not shown). Deletion of amino acids 334–414 or 154–199 from YY1 prevents nuclear localization, DNA binding, and transactivation or interaction with CBP (16Austen M. Lüscher B. Lüscher-Firzlaff J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), respectively. Sterol-regulated induction of the reporter genes utilized in the current study requires nuclear localization of mature SREBP, a process that is normally dependent on cellular cholesterol depletion (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar). In the experiment of Fig. 4, cells were incubated in the presence of excess sterols to repress the proteolytic cleavage and release of mature endogenous SREBP from the endoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, luciferase activity measured in cells transiently transfected with either an HMG-CoA synthase (Fig.4 A) or HMG-CoA reductase (Fig. 4 B) promoter-reporter gene was low but increased dramatically when sterol-treated cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding mature SREBP-1a (Fig. 4, lanes 2 versus 1). Fig. 4 A shows that the SREBP-1a-dependent induction of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter-reporter gene was attenuated by coexpression of wild-type YY1 (lane 4 versus 2) but not by coexpression of mutant YY1(Δ296–331) (lane 6 versus 2) or YY1(Δ399–414) (lanes 8 versus 2) proteins. In contrast, induction of the HMG-CoA reductase promoter-reporter gene by coexpressed SREBP-1a was unaffected by coexpressed YY1 (Fig.4 B, lane 4 versus 2). Under sterol-repressed conditions, the expression of pFPPS, pLDLr, pSYNSRE, and pRED was unaffected by cotransfected wild-type or mutant YY1 (Figs.Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4; data not shown). Taken together, the studies described in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 demonstrate that wild-type YY1 represses the transcriptional induction of promoter-reporter constructs derived from three genes (FPP synthase, HMG-CoA synthase, and the LDL receptor genes) that are known to be responsive to changes in nuclear SREBPs or cellular sterol depletion. This inhibitory effect is specific because the expression of a fourth sterol- and SREBP-responsive reporter gene (pRED) was not affected by cotransfected YY1. Based on the studies with mutant YY1 proteins that are either unable to enter the nucleus or are defective in binding DNA, we hypothesized that YY1 must bind to the promoters of specific SREBP-responsive genes to bring about transcriptional repression. The proximal promoters of HMG-CoA reductase, FPP synthase, HMG-CoA synthase, and the LDL receptor genes that were used in the current study are illustrated in Fig.5 A. Transcriptional activation of the latter three genes in response to cellular sterol depletion is dependent on the binding of SREBP and either NF-Y or Sp1 to the proximal promoters (Fig. 5 A) (1Brown M.S.

Ericsson J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the HMG-CoA reductase gene is less well understood, although such activation does require SREBP (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar, 37Vallett S.M. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12247-12253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The proximal promoters of all four SREBP-responsive genes contain putative binding sites (CCAT or ACAT) for YY1 that are adjacent to or overlap with binding sites for SREBP or NF-Y (Fig. 5 A). We postulated that the inhibitory effect of YY1 (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4) might result from YY1-mediated displacement of SREBP, NF-Y, or Sp1 from the promoters of pFPPS, pSYNSRE, and pLDLr. Alternatively, YY1 might bind to DNA and sterically interfere with critical interactions between SREBP, NF-Y, Sp1, and coactivators that are required for transcription. To test these postulates, we utilized 32P-end-labeled DNA probes corresponding to the proximal promoters of these genes together with recombinant NF-Y, SREBP-1a, and YY1 proteins in electromobility shift assays (Figs. 5, B and D) and DNase I footprint assays (Figs. 5 C). Fig. 5 B shows the results obtained in EMSAs that utilized recombinant YY1 and32P-end-labeled DNA, corresponding to the proximal promoters of either HMG-CoA synthase (−324 to −225), FPP synthase (−365 to −47) or the LDL receptor (−225 to −116) genes. The results indicate that recombinant YY1 binds to all three DNA fragments and results in the formation of multiple-shifted DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 5 B). The shifted DNA-YY1 complexes were specific because inclusion of excess unlabeled DNA containing a consensus YY1 binding site competed for binding, whereas the addition of excess unlabeled DNA containing a mutated YY1 binding site did not affect the formation of the 32P-DNA:YY1 complex (data not shown). YY1 also bound to a 117-base pair fragment of the FPP synthase promoter (−293 to −177) that includes the binding sites for NF-Y and SREBP (Fig. 5 A) (data not shown). The formation of multiple-shifted complexes was also observed when a radiolabeled DNA fragment containing a single consensus YY1 binding motif was incubated with recombinant YY1 protein (data not shown). The formation of multiple specific complexes between DNA and recombinant YY1 has been noted previously (19Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 C shows that recombinant YY1 protein bound to the HMG-CoA synthase promoter and protected nucleotides −306 to −290 from DNase I digestion. Analysis of the complementary (upper) DNA strand sequence indicates that the protected DNA includes a classical core YY1 binding site (CCAT, −297 to −294) (Fig. 5 C, open circle) that overlaps an NF-Y binding site (ATTGG, −295 to −291) (Fig. 5 C, open rectangle). The binding of NF-Y to this ATTGG sequence has been shown to be critical and necessary for elevated transcription of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter-reporter gene in response to cellular sterol deprivation (7Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Additional EMSAs demonstrated that a 100-base pair fragment of the HMG-CoA synthase promoter (-324 to −225) bound either recombinant YY1 (Fig.5 D, lane 2) or NF-Y (Fig. 5 D,lane 3). However, the addition of excess YY1 displaced NF-Y from the DNA, and no DNA:YY1:NF-Y complex was observed (Fig.5 D, lane 4). In addition, when the protein ratio of YY1:NF-Y was <4:1, the radiolabeled DNA probe was bound by either YY1 or NF-Y but not by the two proteins at once (data not shown), consistent with the hypothesis that the two proteins are unable to bind to the probe at the same time. Incubation of the FPP synthase probe with YY1 and either NF-Y or SREBP resulted in the formation of multiple complexes (data not shown). In contrast to the studies with the HMG-CoA synthase probe, we obtained no evidence that YY1 displaced either NF-Y or SREBP from the FPP synthase probe (data not shown). The current studies have led to the identification of YY1 as a transcriptional repressor of some, but not all, SREBP/ADD1-regulated genes. We identified cis elements that bind recombinant YY1 protein in the proximal promoters of FPP synthase, HMG-CoA synthase, the LDL receptor, and HMG-CoA reductase genes (Fig. 5 B and data not shown). However, coexpression of wild-type YY1 inhibited the sterol-dependent regulation of pFPPS, pSYNSRE, and pLDLr but not pRED (Figs. 1, 2, and 4), consistent with an inhibitory effect of YY1 on the transcription of some, but not all, SREBP/ADD1-regulated genes. Detailed studies demonstrate that YY1 and NF-Y bind to overlapping sites on the HMG-CoA synthase promoter and that NF-Y is displaced from the DNA by excess YY1 (Figs. 5, C andD). Previous studies have demonstrated that elevated transcription of the HMG-CoA synthase gene is dependent, in part, on the binding of NF-Y to ATTGG (an inverted CCAAT box) (7Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 8Dooley K.A. Millinder S. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1349-1356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 9Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Mantovani R. Edwards P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 767-776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a motif that overlaps the YY1 binding site (Fig. 5 C). Thus, it appears likely that the displacement of NF-Y from the inverted CCAAT box by YY1 (Fig. 5 D) accounts for the attenuated transcription of the HMG-CoA synthase gene by cotransfected YY1 (Figs.1 and 4). We have been unable to demonstrate YY1-dependent displacement of either NF-Y or SREBP from the FPP synthase or LDL receptor proximal promoters (data not shown). These results are perhaps not surprising because the putative YY1 binding sites do not overlap with the binding sites for NF-Y, Sp1, or SREBP (Fig. 5 A). Further studies will be necessary to determine the mechanism by which YY1 represses the transcription of the FPP synthase and LDL receptor genes. Repression may result from inappropriate bending of DNA by YY1 (18Shi Y. Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F49-F66Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 38Kim J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4341-4348Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or quenching, as the result of the sequestration of, or interference with, coactivator proteins such as CBP (16Austen M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1709-1717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and to be required for SREBP-dependent transcriptional induction of FPP synthase and the LDL receptor genes (39Oliner J.D. Andresen M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 40Ericsson J. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17865-17870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Alternatively, YY1 may bind to the promoters and recruit histone deacetylases such as histone deacetylase 1–3 that are known to interact with YY1 (41Yang W.-M. Yao Y.-L. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). These histone deacetylases repress transcription when tethered to promoters through interaction with YY1 (41Yang W.-M. Yao Y.-L. Sun J.-M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine whether histone deacetylation plays a role in sterol-regulated transcription. Regardless of the exact mechanism, we hypothesize that the role of YY1 is to maintain SREBP-regulated genes in a transcriptionally repressed state in the absence of nuclear SREBP. When the nuclear levels of SREBP increase, following either cellular cholesterol starvation (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar) or adipocyte differentiation (2Tontonoz P. Kim J.B. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4753-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 15Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1096-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar), we propose that the YY1-mediated repression is overcome through synergistic interactions between SREBP and either NF-Y or Sp1 on the DNA. The finding that the nuclear levels of YY1 remain constant would ensure that the expression of these genes is turned off in a timely manner as the nuclear levels of SREBP decrease. Future studies will be directed at understanding the factors that modulate the activity of YY1. Transcription of each SREBP-regulated gene is likely to be complex and to depend not only on the nuclear localization of both positive and negative transcription factors but also on the relative affinity of each factor for specific cis elements, the number of these elements in each promoter, and the transcriptional strength of the final complex. The observation that transcriptional induction of different genes in response to SREBP is markedly different in mice that overexpress SREBPs (35Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Hammer R.E. Goldstein J.L. Shimano H. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is but one example of the complexity of this process. In preliminary studies, an HMG-CoA synthase promoter-reporter gene was transiently transfected into HepG2 cells, and the cells were then grown in media supplemented with sterols to repress the proteolytic release of SREBPs from the endoplasmic reticulum and the transcription of the reporter gene. A partial relief of this repression was observed in cells cotransfected with a plasmid encoding the adenoviral E1A protein (data not shown). A further increase in the expression of the reporter gene was observed in cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding both E1A and CBP (data not shown). This result is consistent with earlier observations demonstrating that E1A can relieve YY1 transcriptional repression in a CBP/p300-dependent fashion (29Lee J.-S. Galvin K.M. See R.H. Eckner R. Livingston D. Moran E. Shi Y. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1188-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). These additional results with the HMG-CoA synthase promoter-reporter gene provide further support for the proposal that endogenous YY1 affects the transcription of specific sterol- and SREBP-regulated genes. We thank Bernard Lee for excellent technical assistance and Drs. B. Lüscher and M. Austen for their generosity in supplying various YY1 plasmids, as indicated in the text."

One of these transcripts is greatly induced in copper-deficient cells by transcriptional activation, whereas the other forms are copper-insensitive. The induced form of the transcript was expressed coordinately with the cytochromec 6-encoding (Cyc6) gene, which is known to be transcriptionally regulated in copper-deficient cells. The sequence GTAC, which forms the core of a copper response element associated with the Cyc6 gene, is also essential for induction of the Cpx1 gene, suggesting that both are targets of the same signal transduction pathway. The constitutive and induced Cpx1 transcripts have the same half-lives in vivo, and all encode the same polypeptide with a chloroplast-targeting transit sequence, but the shortest one representing the induced form is a 2–4-fold better template for translation than are either of the constitutive forms. The enzyme remains localized to a soluble compartment in the chloroplast even in induced cells, and its abundance is not affected when the tetrapyrrole pathway is manipulated either genetically or by gabaculine treatment.

Plastocyanin is a small thylakoid lumen-localized copper protein that functions in photosynthesis to transfer electrons from cytf of the cyt b 6 f complex to P700+ in photosystem I (reviewed in Refs. 3Morand L.Z.

Because it is required for plastocyanin function, copper is essential for photosynthesis in plants (9Owen C.A.J. Copper Deficiency and Toxicity: Acquired and Inherited, in Plants, Animals and Man.

Plant Sci. 1990; 9: 111-123Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, many green algae and cyanobacteria can adapt under conditions of copper deficiency by inducing the synthesis of heme-containing cytc 6, which functions as an alternate electron transfer catalyst (2Sandmann G. Reck H. Kessler E. Boger P. Arch. Microbiol. 1983; 134: 23-27Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Sandmann G. Arch. Microbiol. 1986; 145: 76-79Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The replacement of the copper protein by a heme protein allows the organism to remain photosynthetically competent in the face of copper deficiency, a situation that is not uncommon in nature (4Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In C. reinhardtii, cyt c 6 expression is regulated via transcriptional activation of theCyc6 gene under conditions of copper deficiency (13Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar). Plastocyanin abundance is regulated at the level of accumulation of the mature protein; in −Cu cells, the plastocyanin-encoding genePcy1 continues to be transcribed, the mRNA is translated, and the pre-apoprotein is imported into chloroplasts and processed, but if copper is not available, the relatively unstable apoprotein is degraded readily (14Merchant S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23504-23510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition to changes in the abundance of plastocyanin and cyt c 6, other differences have been noted between copper-deficient versuscopper-replete cells, including increased synthesis of a 35-kDa polypeptide and induction of a high affinity copper uptake mechanism (16Merchant S. Bogorad L. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2531-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 17Hill K.L. Hassett R. Kosman D. Merchant S. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These increases in response to copper deficiency occur in coordination with cyt c 6 synthesis and accumulation, and therefore are potential targets of the same signal transduction pathway. In previous work, the 35-kDa polypeptide was purified and identified as the enzyme coproporphyrinogen III (coprogen) oxidase through assay of its enzymatic activity and sequence analysis of tryptic peptides (18Hill K.L. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Coprogen oxidase is the 5th enzyme in the 6-step pathway leading from δ-aminolevulinic acid to protoporphyrin IX, the substrate for ferrochelatase, yielding heme or, for magnesium-chelatase, eventually yielding chlorophyll (19Beale S.I. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1993: 519-558Google Scholar, 20Timko M.P. Rochaix J.-D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 377-414Google Scholar). Increased synthesis of coprogen oxidase in copper-deficient cells was attributed to increased abundance ofCpx1 mRNA and was rationalized on the basis of an increased demand for heme when cyt c 6 synthesis is induced (18Hill K.L. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The entire heme biosynthetic pathway is localized in the plastid although ferrochelatase and protoporphyrinogen oxidase are found also in plant mitochondria (21Smith A.G. Marsh O. Elder G.H. Biochem.

In the case of protoporphyrinogen oxidase, one isoform is specifically targeted to each of the organelles, but whereas one of the ferrochelatase precursors is specifically targeted to chloroplasts, dual targeting of the other precursor has been proposed, with plastid targeting occurring as efficiently as mitochondrion targeting (22Chow K.S. Singh D.P. Roper J.M. Smith A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27565-27571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The discovery that coprogen oxidase activity was so highly induced in copper-deficient cells raised several questions concerning both the copper-responsive signal transduction pathway and the operation of the tetrapyrrole pathway. Specifically, was the Cpx1 gene regulated by the same mechanism as the Cyc6 gene? Does the observed regulation occur in direct response to copper deficiency or indirectly to heme depletion? Does all of the enzyme remain plastid-localized in copper-deficient cells or is it redistributed to the mitochondrion? Is the subsequent enzyme in the pathway, protoporphyrinogen oxidase, induced? To address these questions, we isolated full-length cDNAs corresponding to transcripts from copper-supplemented and copper-deficient cells, characterized induced and constitutive forms of Cpx1 transcripts with respect to half-lives and translatability in vivo, tested for mitochondrial localization of the enzyme, and analyzed cloned genomic DNA for its ability to confer copper responsiveness to a reporter gene. The possibility that Ppx1 transcripts (encoding the chloroplast form of protoporphyrinogen oxidase) exhibited copper-responsive regulation was also tested. Cultures of C. reinhardtii wild type strains CC124, CC125, 2137, and strain CC849 (cw10); strain CC425 (arg2, cw15); and transformants derived from CC425 were maintained under constant illumination (∼100 μmol m−2 s−1) in copper-containing (6 μm) or “copper-free” TAP or TAP agar (25Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 297: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), supplemented with 200 μg/ml arginine for strain CC425. The mutant strain y-1 (yellow in the dark) was maintained under either constant illumination or constant darkness in +Cu or −Cu TAP medium. Cells were de-greened by growing in the dark and making serial one-half dilutions of cells into fresh medium. Cells took 7–12 days (average, 10 days) to completely de-green. Genomic sequences encoding coprogen oxidase were identified from a C. reinhardtii λ-EMBL3 genomic DNA library (26Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) by plaque hybridization to cpx440 DNA (18Hill K.L. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). An ∼3.8-kilobase pair SstI fragment was subcloned in both orientations into pBSIIKS(−) (Stratagene) to generate pCpx1a and c. An overlapping 5.8-kilobase pair NotI-SalI fragment from a different λ clone containing ∼ 4.9 kilobase pairs of additional 3′ untranslated sequence was also subcloned and an additional ∼800 base pairs of 3′ flanking sequence obtained (Fig.1, A and B). Two cDNA libraries were screened using cpx440 as a probe. Both libraries were generated from RNA isolated from copper-deficient cultures of either C. reinhardtii strain CC124 (λZipLox library) or 2137 (λgt11 library) (27Merchant S. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9062-9067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From the λgt11 library, an ∼2.0-kilobase pair fragment that contained the entire 1098 base pairs of coding sequence and 770 base pairs of 3′ UTR was identified. From the λZipLox library, an overlapping ∼1.1-kilobase pair fragment that contained an additional 159 base pairs of 5′ untranslated sequence was identified and recovered in plasmid pZL1 following the manufacturer's excision protocol. The plasmid was named pCPX1.1. TheEcoRI fragment from the λgt11 clone was subcloned by standard techniques into pBSIIKS(−) to generate pCPX2.0. Genomic and cDNA clones were sequenced on both strands at the sequencing facility at UCLA using the ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer). Sequences were edited and assembled using the ABI PRISM Sequencing Analysis and Autoassembler programs (Perkin-Elmer), and further analyzed using DNA Strider, version 1.2 (28Marck C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1829-1836Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations were verified by sequencing (T7 Sequenase, version 2.0, sequencing kit, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primers for amplification of C. reinhardtii Ppx1 cDNA (encoding protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase I) were designed based on the partial genomic DNA sequence (29Randolph-Anderson B.L. Sato R. Johnson A.M.

This fragment was digested with SacII andPstI and the resulting 196-base pair fragment was cloned into pBSIIKS(+), yielding pPpx196. Total DNA and total RNA from C. reinhardtii cells was isolated and analyzed by DNA or RNA blot hybridization as described previously (30Kindle K.K. Schnell R.A. Fernandez E. Lefebvre P.A. J.

The hybridization signals were visualized after exposure to Kodak XAR-5 (Eastman Kodak) or NEN Reflection (NEN Life Science Products) x-ray film at −80 °C with two intensifying screens. Hybridization signals were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and Image QuaNT (v. 4.2a) software (Sunnyvale, CA). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA by poly(U)-Sepharose chromatography as described (18Hill K.L. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Total RNA from cultures of C. reinhardtii was analyzed by three different methods to map the 5′ ends of transcripts from copper-supplemented versuscopper-deficient grown cells. 5′-RACE was performed using the Life Technologies, Inc. 5′-RACE system according to the manufacturer's instructions, using primer 2 for the initial amplification and primer 8 (Table I) for the nested amplification reactions. S1 nuclease protection analysis was performed (40Sharp P.A. Berk A.J. Berget S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 750-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using end-labeled primer 10 (Table I) and the genomic DNA clone pCpx1c as the template, followed by digestion with SalI to produce a 427-base pair single-stranded DNA fragment as the probe. RNase protection analysis was performed using the RPAII kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). TheHindIII-KpnI fragment (nucleotides +150 to −40 of the genomic DNA sequence) from the coprogen oxidase-encoding gene promoter was cloned into pBSIIKS(−) and digested with KpnI. Labeled antisense RNA was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP and was gel-purified. Hybridization signals were quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and Image QuaNT software. The indicated 5′ fragments of the coprogen oxidase-encoding gene (Cpx1) were cloned into theKpnI site of the promoterless arylsulfatase (Ars2) construct pJD54 (41Davies J.P. Weeks D.P. Grossman A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2959-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) or into the β-tubulin-arylsulfatase construct pJD100 (42Davies J.P. Grossman A.R. Mol. Cell.

The resulting constructs, pCpxArs 1–5 (shown in Table III) were cotransformed into CC425 with the pArg7.8 plasmid (13Quinn J.M. Merchant S. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 623-638PubMed Google Scholar). Arginine prototrophic transformants were tested on copper-supplementedversus copper-deficient TAP plates for copper-responsive arylsulfatase expression and analyzed by quantitative arylsulfatase assays (13Quinn J.M.

Open table in a new tab The 404-base pair SalI to HinDIII fragment from the 5′ upstream sequence of pCpx1a was subcloned into pBSIIKS(+) and mutagenized by overlap extension PCR (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar) using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), reverse and universal vector primers and gene specific mutagenic primers. The complementary gene-specific mutagenic primer pairs were 5 and 12 (see Table I) for construct 4 (see Table III) and 7 and 14 for construct 5. All mutagenized fragments were sequenced to verify introduction of the desired mutation and absence of nontarget mutations. Primers 18 plus 15 (Table I) were used to amplify an ∼1.0-kilobase pair fragment from pCPX2.0 corresponding to amino acid residues 32–366 (the mature protein sequence). Amplification conditions were 95 °C for 5 min prior toTaq polymerase addition, 4 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min followed by 26 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final 15-min extension at 72 °C. The resulting product was gel-purified, digested with BamHI and cloned in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of the thioredoxin-encoding sequence of the expression vector pTrxFus (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA), and introduced into Escherichia coli host strain GI724 for tryptophan-inducible expression. Because the fusion protein localized to inclusion bodies, a preparation of enriched inclusion bodies was solubilized (44Marston F.A.O. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, Volume III: A Practical Approach. III. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 59-88Google Scholar) and used directly for antiserum production. Polyclonal antibodies were raised in rabbits by Cocalico Biologicals Inc. (Reamstown, PA) by popliteal lymph node injection of the purified antigen (0.25 mg) followed by three intramuscular boosts (0.15 mg). The resulting antiserum was designated anti-cpx-trx. The cDNA fragment cpx440 (18Hill K.L. Merchant S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 857-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was cloned into the glutathioneS-transferase fusion vector pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting overexpressed fusion protein localized to inclusion bodies, which were isolated (44Marston F.A.O. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning, Volume III: A Practical Approach. III. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 59-88Google Scholar), and the fusion protein was purified by SDS gel electrophoresis (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205496) Google Scholar). Protein bands were visualized with ice cold 0.25 m potassium chloride and gel slices containing the band of interest were sent to Cocalico Biologicals for antiserum (anti-cpx-glutathione S-transferase) production. CC425 or CC124 cells were grown in copper-free low sulfate TAP medium to mid-log phase. Cultures were divided into fresh acid-washed flasks, and CuCl2-EDTA (to 6 μm), and/or gabaculine (3-amino-2,3-dihydrobenzoic acid; Sigma) (to 2 mm) was added to cells. After incubation (6.8–19 h), cells were collected by centrifugation, and resuspended to 1 × 108 cells/ml in either copper-supplemented or copper-free, sulfate-free TAP medium, and allowed to recover for 2 h on a tissue culture wheel at 25 °C under constant illumination (∼50 μmol m−2s−1) before radiolabeling. Just prior to radiolabeling, a 1-ml aliquot was removed for preparation of total RNA, and a 0.5-ml aliquot was removed for extraction of soluble protein to allow for quantitation of the abundance of Cpx1 mRNA and coprogen oxidase. Radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation were carried out with the remaining part of the culture using anti-cpx-trx antiserum (46Li H.H. Quinn J. Culler D. Girard-Bascou J. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31283-31289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Soluble extracts were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting (47Merchant S. Hill K. Howe G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using anti-cpx-trx antiserum. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected using125I-labeled protein A, and signals quantitated using the PhosphorImager and Image QuaNT software. Nuclear material was prepared, stored, and assayed as described previously (47Merchant S. Hill K. Howe G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1383-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Hybridization signals were quantified using the PhosphorImager. Mitochondrial preparations were made as described (48Eriksson M. Gardeström P. Samuelsson G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) from strain CC849. Proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by immunoblotting (47Merchant S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 9368-9375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that nonfat dry milk was used instead of calf serum as the blocking reagent for detection of carbonic anhydrase. Anti-cpx-glutathioneS-transferase antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:3000, anti-carbonic anhydrase antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:2000, and anti-Oee1 antiserum was used at a dilution of 1:3000. Bound primary antibody was detected with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and chromogenic substrate. When copper is added to −Cu cells, the abundance of Cpx1 transcripts decreases dramatically within 60 min, reminiscent of the decay ofCyc6 transcripts (32Hill K.L. Li H.H. Singer J. Merchant S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15060-15067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). But in contrast to the situation withCyc6, in which the transcripts continue to decay over a period of 180 min until they are completely gone, Cpx1transcripts dropped to a minimal level and then reaccumulated to reach a new steady state comparable to that in cells maintained constantly under copper replete conditions (Fig. 2). We noted a small but highly reproducible shift in the mobility of theCpx1 hybridizing band during establishment of the new steady state. The Cpx1 transcript from copper-supplemented cells appeared slightly larger than the form in −Cu cells (compare 60- and 100- or 120-min time points in Fig. 2).This suggested that there were at least two types of Cpx1 mRNAs. The different species might represent alternative transcripts from one gene, or they might represent products of two different genes. Southern analysis of total DNA from C. reinhardtii cut with four different restriction enzymes revealed a single hybridizing band in each case (Fig. 3), and its size matched the size predicted from the sequence of the Cpx1gene described in this work (Figs. 1 and4). The same hybridization pattern was observed even under low stringency conditions (hybridization temperature, 50 °C; data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that coprogen oxidase is encoded by a single gene in C. reinhardtii: the different sized transcripts must result then from differential processing of a precursor RNA or from initiation of transcription at different sites.Figure 4Nucleotide sequence ofCpx1. Numbering for the genomic DNA clone (−1049 to +3542) and amino acids (1–365) is indicated on the leftside of the sequence and the numbering for the cDNA (1–2016) is shown on the right.

By Northern analysis, OGP mRNA is indistinguishable from H4 mRNA. Indeed, cells transfected with a construct encoding [His102]H4 secreted the corresponding [His13]OGP. These results suggest production of OGP from H4 genes. Cells transfected with H4-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion genes expressed both “long” and “short” CAT proteins. The short CAT was retained following an ATG → TTG mutation of the H4 ATG initiation codon, but not following mutation of the in-frame internal ATG85 codon, which, unlike ATG1, resides within a perfect context for translational initiation. These results suggest that a PreOGP is translated starting at AUG85. The translational initiation at AUG85could be inhibited by optimizing the nucleotide sequence surrounding ATG1 to maximally support upstream translational initiation, thus implicating leaky ribosomal scanning in usage of the internal AUG. Conversion of the predicted PreOGP to OGP was shown in a cell lysate system using synthetic [His102]H4-(85–103) as substrate. Together, our results demonstrate that H4 gene expression diverges at the translational level into the simultaneous parallel production of both H4, a nuclear structural protein, and OGP, an extracellular regulatory peptide.

Histone genes serve as templates for the synthesis of histones that package DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle, and exhibit remarkable evolutionary conservation. Each of the main five histone proteins in mammalian cells, H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, is encoded by a family of genes, most of which are arranged in clusters and expressed predominantly in dividing cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Doenecke D.

In in vivo rodent models, OGP increases bone mass (8Bab I. Gazit D. Chorev M. Muhlrad A. Shteyer A. Greenberg Z. Namdar M. Kahn A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1867-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), stimulates blood and bone marrow cellularity, and enhances engraftment of bone marrow transplants (12Gurevitch O. Slavin S.

The amino acid sequence identity between OGP and the carboxyl-terminal region of histone H4 prompted us to test the hypothesis that OGP is derived from histone H4 gene(s). Indeed, we demonstrate that histone H4 genes do encode OGP, and that OGP synthesis is supported by leaky ribosomal scanning through the suboptimal AUG initiator of histone H4 mRNA.DISCUSSIONOGP is a regulator of cell growth and activity identical to the carboxyl terminus of H4 (H4-(90–103)). Similar to all other histone genes, the H4 genes are present in higher eukaryotes in multiple copies and they typically lack introns (1Doenecke D. Albig W. Bode C. Drabent B. Franke K. Gavenis K. Witt O. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 29Wells D. McBride C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17 (suppl.): 311-346Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). All mammalian H4 genes encode the same polypeptide. Significant diversity observed in the third position of most codons as well as outside the protein-coding sequence is assumed to ensure expression in a variety of cells under broad physiological conditions. OGP could be a de novotranslational product of any of the multiple H4 gene copies or a post-translational cleavage product of H4 protein. It could also be a product of an H4-related gene or an H4-fragmented gene. The Northern blot analysis carried out herein demonstrated that OGP mRNA(s) is indistinguishable from H4 mRNA(s) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we altered a rat somatic H4 gene (X13554) at codon 102, and showed that thisbona fide H4 gene gave rise to the anticipated OGP mutant in transfected cells (Fig. 1). Since selection of the rat somatic H4 gene, as well as the human H4FO108 gene (see below) was random, our results suggest that OGP is produced from these and probably other H4 genes.H4-derived constructs, based on either the rat somatic (X13554) or the human H4 FO108 (M16707) genes, in which the H4 coding sequences were fused in frame to the bacterial CAT gene lacking its ATG initiation codon, gave rise to both long and short CAT-containing proteins (Fig.2), consistent with the production of OGP from H4 genes. By deletion and point mutations of the rat H4-CAT fusion gene, it was demonstrated that production of the long and short proteins depends on ATG1 and ATG85, respectively, suggesting that translation can start at either of these methionine codons (Fig. 3). In addition, we showed that the predicted translation product of the downstream initiation (H4-(85–103)), which we have designated PreOGP, is processed to OGP by a ROS 17/2.8 cell extract (Fig. 4). It therefore appears that the H4 mRNA is translated simultaneously to both H4 protein and PreOGP. The latter is then converted to OGP.The PreOGP-to-OGP pathway may be mediated by either limited exopeptidase activity or a specific endopeptidase. Either way, a CAT-tagged H4 protein did not serve as a substrate for this activity in transfected cells (Fig. 5), possibly reflecting sequestration of the proteolytic site when residing within a full-length H4 protein sequence. As opposed to H4 proteolysis, de novo synthesis of OGP via alternative translation of H4 mRNA, as suggested by the present study, facilitates the production and secretion of OGP independently of H4 protein synthesis. Furthermore, OGP synthesis by alternative translation avoids production of a truncated H4 protein (amino acids 1–89), which may be undesirable to the cell. Although irrelevant to OGP biosynthesis, our experiments with CAT-tagged H4 genes also disclosed proteolysis of the H4 peptide sequence at a site within the OGP domain (Fig. 5). This activity may be related to the limited production of OGP-(10–14) from PreOGP and/or OGP (Fig. 4). This proteolytic activity seems to favor the full-length H4 over PreOGP or OGP as substrate (Fig. 5). Thus, we propose three previously unidentified processes in H4 gene expression: (i) alternative translational initiation at AUG85, giving rise to PreOGP; (ii) proteolysis between Tyr5 and Ala6 of the PreOGP, thus yielding OGP; and (iii) proteolysis at a further COOH-terminal site, with full-length H4 as the preferred substrate. Possible roles for the latter proteolytic activity include synthesis of OGP-(10–14) and, perhaps, regulation of H4 stability and availability for DNA packaging.Translational initiation at an AUG codon that is not the first following the transcription start site is uncommon for genes encoding structural proteins but rather frequently observed in genes encoding regulatory polypeptides such as cytokines, receptors, protein kinases, transcription factors, and growth factors (reviewed in Ref. 30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Unlike viral genes, downstream translational initiation of cellular genes usually reflects the presence of an mRNA molecule which starts 3′ of the first ATG (reviewed in Ref. 30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). However, translational initiation at a downstream AUG codon can also be mediated by internal ribosome entry, which has been demonstrated initially in viral and more recently in cellular genes (see Ref. 31Gan W. La Celle M. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5006-5012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, and references therein). Finally, when the first AUG is weak due to primary sequence context, length, or structure of flanking sequences, initiation at such a site may be “leaky” leading to alternative utilization of a downstream AUG (reviewed in Ref. 30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Translational initiation at AUG85 of H4 mRNAs seems to be mediated primarily by leaky ribosomal scanning through the imperfect sequence context of the AUG1 codon, as evidenced by the inhibition of downstream translational initiation observed following optimization of the suboptimal AUG1 (Figs. 2 C and 5). Although alternative translation via a leaky ribosomal scanning is not unprecedented (30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), the synthesis of H4 protein and OGP from H4 mRNA is striking in that the two products apparently have diverse functions.Fidelity of ATG initiators is primarily determined by the nucleotides occupying positions −3 and +4 relative to the A of the ATG, defined as +1. Optimally, these nucleotides should be a purine and a guanine, respectively. Indeed, at least one of them is found in most cellular mRNAs (32Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). All higher eukaryotic H4 genes known to us, from both animals and plants, have a purine at position −3. However, position +4 is usually occupied by a thymidine, or more rarely by an adenine, but never by a guanine (Table I). Although the combination of a purine at −3 and a thymidine at +4 is still rather efficient in supporting translational initiation, the deviation from the optimal sequence is sufficient to cause some leaky ribosomal scanning, thereby allowing alternative translational initiation at a second AUG (26Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar). Thus, based on sequence analysis, leaky ribosomal scanning through AUG1, demonstrated in the present study for one randomly selected H4 gene, may be a common feature of many, if not, all H4 genes in higher eukaryotes, animals and plants alike. Leaky scanning may be further enhanced in atypical H4 genes with short leaders (33Kozak M. Gene Exp. 1991; 1: 111-115PubMed Google Scholar), such as the mouse clone 12 H4 gene (Ref. 34Meier V.S. Bohni R. Schumperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 795Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; accession no. X13235). In addition, utilization of the AUG85 codon to initiate translation from any given H4 mRNA may vary as a function of the cell type (Fig. 6) and/or the physiological conditions.Our results suggest that ATG85 of the rat X13554 H4 gene is utilized as an alternative translational initiator to the suboptimally flanked AUG1 codon. AUG85 itself resides within an optimal context for translational initiation, not only in this specific gene, but almost in every eukaryotic H4 gene (Table I). Thus, the combination of a suboptimal AUG1 and an optimal ATG85 appears to be a hallmark of higher eukaryotic H4 genes, lending support to the hypothesis that OGP synthesis by alternative translation of H4 genes occurs in many eukaryotic organisms and may have an important evolutionary conserved role(s). Interestingly, the 85th residue of Styela plicata, as well as most lower eukaryotic H4 genes, is a leucine (Table I), demonstrating that a methionine in this position is not imposed by structural requirements for DNA packaging. It is tempting to speculate that the selection of H4-AUG85 by higher eukaryotes is related to mechanisms in these organisms, versus others (35Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar) that allow leaky ribosomal scanning through imperfect 5′ proximal initiators. That OGP is ubiquitously expressed in higher eukaryotic cells is suggested not only by sequence analysis of H4 genes, but also by the identification of OGP in conditioned medium of all cell lines thus far tested: MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, NIH3T3 fibroblasts (10Greenberg Z. Gavish H. Muhlrad A. Chorev M. Shteyer A AttarNamdar M. Tartakovsky A. Bab I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells (this paper). This conclusion is further supported by the demonstration of long and short CAT forms produced from an H4-CAT fusion gene in five randomly selected cell types from different species (Fig. 6). Still, the variation in the long/short CAT ratio exhibited by these cells may suggest preferential expression of OGP by certain cell types. In terms of biological activity, however, OGP production is probably just one component in a complex regulatory system, where additional factors, such as receptors for OGP and their connections with intracellular signaling networks, are most likely involved in determining the OGP target cell selectivity and the nature of the cellular response.In summary, as suggested by sequence analysis of eukaryotic H4 genes, the present study demonstrates some leaky ribosomal scanning through AUG1 of H4 mRNA, resulting in alternative translational initiation at AUG85.The predicted alternative translation product, H4-(85–103) has been designated PreOGP, as it is proteolytically processed to OGP (e.g. H4-(90–103)), a circulating peptide that regulates cell growth and activity. This biosynthetic mechanism, apparently operative in many, if not all, eukaryotic cycling cells, may play a crucial role in the previously reported positive feedback circuit of OGP, which controls cell proliferation (10Greenberg Z.

Histone genes serve as templates for the synthesis of histones that package DNA during the S phase of the cell cycle, and exhibit remarkable evolutionary conservation. Each of the main five histone proteins in mammalian cells, H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, is encoded by a family of genes, most of which are arranged in clusters and expressed predominantly in dividing cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Doenecke D. Albig W. Bode C. Drabent B. Franke K. Gavenis K. Witt O. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 107: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fewer histone genes have been described (1Doenecke D.

H4-derived constructs, based on either the rat somatic (X13554) or the human H4 FO108 (M16707) genes, in which the H4 coding sequences were fused in frame to the bacterial CAT gene lacking its ATG initiation codon, gave rise to both long and short CAT-containing proteins (Fig.2), consistent with the production of OGP from H4 genes. By deletion and point mutations of the rat H4-CAT fusion gene, it was demonstrated that production of the long and short proteins depends on ATG1 and ATG85, respectively, suggesting that translation can start at either of these methionine codons (Fig. 3). In addition, we showed that the predicted translation product of the downstream initiation (H4-(85–103)), which we have designated PreOGP, is processed to OGP by a ROS 17/2.8 cell extract (Fig. 4). It therefore appears that the H4 mRNA is translated simultaneously to both H4 protein and PreOGP. The latter is then converted to OGP. The PreOGP-to-OGP pathway may be mediated by either limited exopeptidase activity or a specific endopeptidase. Either way, a CAT-tagged H4 protein did not serve as a substrate for this activity in transfected cells (Fig. 5), possibly reflecting sequestration of the proteolytic site when residing within a full-length H4 protein sequence. As opposed to H4 proteolysis, de novo synthesis of OGP via alternative translation of H4 mRNA, as suggested by the present study, facilitates the production and secretion of OGP independently of H4 protein synthesis. Furthermore, OGP synthesis by alternative translation avoids production of a truncated H4 protein (amino acids 1–89), which may be undesirable to the cell. Although irrelevant to OGP biosynthesis, our experiments with CAT-tagged H4 genes also disclosed proteolysis of the H4 peptide sequence at a site within the OGP domain (Fig. 5). This activity may be related to the limited production of OGP-(10–14) from PreOGP and/or OGP (Fig. 4). This proteolytic activity seems to favor the full-length H4 over PreOGP or OGP as substrate (Fig. 5). Thus, we propose three previously unidentified processes in H4 gene expression: (i) alternative translational initiation at AUG85, giving rise to PreOGP; (ii) proteolysis between Tyr5 and Ala6 of the PreOGP, thus yielding OGP; and (iii) proteolysis at a further COOH-terminal site, with full-length H4 as the preferred substrate. Possible roles for the latter proteolytic activity include synthesis of OGP-(10–14) and, perhaps, regulation of H4 stability and availability for DNA packaging. Translational initiation at an AUG codon that is not the first following the transcription start site is uncommon for genes encoding structural proteins but rather frequently observed in genes encoding regulatory polypeptides such as cytokines, receptors, protein kinases, transcription factors, and growth factors (reviewed in Ref. 30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Unlike viral genes, downstream translational initiation of cellular genes usually reflects the presence of an mRNA molecule which starts 3′ of the first ATG (reviewed in Ref. 30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). However, translational initiation at a downstream AUG codon can also be mediated by internal ribosome entry, which has been demonstrated initially in viral and more recently in cellular genes (see Ref. 31Gan W. La Celle M. Rhoads R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5006-5012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, and references therein). Finally, when the first AUG is weak due to primary sequence context, length, or structure of flanking sequences, initiation at such a site may be “leaky” leading to alternative utilization of a downstream AUG (reviewed in Ref. 30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Translational initiation at AUG85 of H4 mRNAs seems to be mediated primarily by leaky ribosomal scanning through the imperfect sequence context of the AUG1 codon, as evidenced by the inhibition of downstream translational initiation observed following optimization of the suboptimal AUG1 (Figs. 2 C and 5). Although alternative translation via a leaky ribosomal scanning is not unprecedented (30Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar), the synthesis of H4 protein and OGP from H4 mRNA is striking in that the two products apparently have diverse functions. Fidelity of ATG initiators is primarily determined by the nucleotides occupying positions −3 and +4 relative to the A of the ATG, defined as +1. Optimally, these nucleotides should be a purine and a guanine, respectively. Indeed, at least one of them is found in most cellular mRNAs (32Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4151) Google Scholar). All higher eukaryotic H4 genes known to us, from both animals and plants, have a purine at position −3. However, position +4 is usually occupied by a thymidine, or more rarely by an adenine, but never by a guanine (Table I). Although the combination of a purine at −3 and a thymidine at +4 is still rather efficient in supporting translational initiation, the deviation from the optimal sequence is sufficient to cause some leaky ribosomal scanning, thereby allowing alternative translational initiation at a second AUG (26Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar). Thus, based on sequence analysis, leaky ribosomal scanning through AUG1, demonstrated in the present study for one randomly selected H4 gene, may be a common feature of many, if not, all H4 genes in higher eukaryotes, animals and plants alike. Leaky scanning may be further enhanced in atypical H4 genes with short leaders (33Kozak M. Gene Exp. 1991; 1: 111-115PubMed Google Scholar), such as the mouse clone 12 H4 gene (Ref. 34Meier V.S. Bohni R. Schumperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 795Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar; accession no. X13235). In addition, utilization of the AUG85 codon to initiate translation from any given H4 mRNA may vary as a function of the cell type (Fig. 6) and/or the physiological conditions. Our results suggest that ATG85 of the rat X13554 H4 gene is utilized as an alternative translational initiator to the suboptimally flanked AUG1 codon. AUG85 itself resides within an optimal context for translational initiation, not only in this specific gene, but almost in every eukaryotic H4 gene (Table I). Thus, the combination of a suboptimal AUG1 and an optimal ATG85 appears to be a hallmark of higher eukaryotic H4 genes, lending support to the hypothesis that OGP synthesis by alternative translation of H4 genes occurs in many eukaryotic organisms and may have an important evolutionary conserved role(s). Interestingly, the 85th residue of Styela plicata, as well as most lower eukaryotic H4 genes, is a leucine (Table I), demonstrating that a methionine in this position is not imposed by structural requirements for DNA packaging. It is tempting to speculate that the selection of H4-AUG85 by higher eukaryotes is related to mechanisms in these organisms, versus others (35Merrick W.C. Hershey J.W.B. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 31-69Google Scholar) that allow leaky ribosomal scanning through imperfect 5′ proximal initiators. That OGP is ubiquitously expressed in higher eukaryotic cells is suggested not only by sequence analysis of H4 genes, but also by the identification of OGP in conditioned medium of all cell lines thus far tested: MC3T3-E1 osteoblasts, NIH3T3 fibroblasts (10Greenberg Z. Gavish H. Muhlrad A. Chorev M. Shteyer A AttarNamdar M. Tartakovsky A. Bab I. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 65: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and ROS 17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells (this paper). This conclusion is further supported by the demonstration of long and short CAT forms produced from an H4-CAT fusion gene in five randomly selected cell types from different species (Fig. 6). Still, the variation in the long/short CAT ratio exhibited by these cells may suggest preferential expression of OGP by certain cell types. In terms of biological activity, however, OGP production is probably just one component in a complex regulatory system, where additional factors, such as receptors for OGP and their connections with intracellular signaling networks, are most likely involved in determining the OGP target cell selectivity and the nature of the cellular response. In summary, as suggested by sequence analysis of eukaryotic H4 genes, the present study demonstrates some leaky ribosomal scanning through AUG1 of H4 mRNA, resulting in alternative translational initiation at AUG85.The predicted alternative translation product, H4-(85–103) has been designated PreOGP, as it is proteolytically processed to OGP (e.g. H4-(90–103)), a circulating peptide that regulates cell growth and activity. This biosynthetic mechanism, apparently operative in many, if not all, eukaryotic cycling cells, may play a crucial role in the previously reported positive feedback circuit of OGP, which controls cell proliferation (10Greenberg Z.

https://openalex.org/W2030829976,"The gp190 transmembrane protein, the low affinity receptor for the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), belongs to the hematopoietin family of receptors characterized by the cytokine binding domain (CBD). gp190 is one of the very few members of this family to contain two such domains. The membrane-proximal CBD (herein called D2) is separated from the membrane-distal one (called D1) by an immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domain and is followed by three fibronectin type III repeats. We used truncated gp190 mutants and a blocking anti-gp190 monoclonal antibody to study the role of these repeats in low affinity receptor function. Our results showed that the D1Ig region was involved in LIF binding, while D2 appeared to be crucial for the proper folding of D1, suggesting functionally important interactions between the two CBDs in the wild-type protein. In addition, a point mutation in the carboxyl terminus of the Ig region strongly impaired ligand binding. These findings suggest that at least two distinct sites, both located within the D1Ig region, are involved in LIF binding to gp190, and more generally, that ligand binding sites on these receptors may well be located outside the canonical CBDs."

The use of antibodies in this way provided in situ information about the protein folding process inside the endoplasmic reticulum lumen of cells without external perturbation of the folding chains or the folding compartment. The process of protein folding in the living cell is a more complicated process than previously recognized. It is dependent on a milieu that differs between cellular compartments. It is assisted by a panel of molecular chaperones and folding factors and affected by a variety of processes such as targeting, membrane translocation, covalent modification, and degradation (1Helenius A. Marquardt T. Braakman I. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 227-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 2Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.

Moreover, because folding of proteins begins already at the level of the growing nascent chain, it is likely to occur in a vectorial fashion from the N to C terminus of the growing polypeptide chain (4Tsou C.-L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1809-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Fedorov A.N. Baldwin T.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32715-32718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Whereas the classical in vitro refolding approach used by Anfinsen and Scheraga (6Anfinsen C.B. Scheraga H.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 205-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar) has provided much basic information about the biophysical principles behind the folding of polypeptides, it does not allow for conditions prevailing in the cell to be adequately reproduced. To study protein folding in cells, we and others have therefore made extensive use of a pulse-chase approach in which the folding of a radioactively labeled cohort of proteins is followed in tissue culture cells (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 8Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20598-20605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it reflects the folding process inside the live cell, this technique is also not problem-free. Because the labeled, partially folded proteins must be extracted from the cells and biochemically analyzed, there is no guarantee that their conformation after cell lysis faithfully reflects the conformation they have inside the cell. Ideally, one should be able to monitor the conformation of the folding proteins in situ. In this study, we describe an approach that allows analysis of protein folding inside the unperturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; HA, hemagglutinin; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline It is based on the use of conformation-dependent monoclonal antibodies. The antigen whose folding is to be monitored and antibodies against it are co-expressed in the same cell, and the effects of their interaction on antigen folding are analyzed by the pulse-chase approach. As shown here using influenza hemagglutinin (HA) as a model protein, it is possible to determine whether specific conformations occur during the folding process and whether antibody binding affects it. All hybridoma cell lines were grown in Iscove's Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% gentamycin, and 1% Glutamax I (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 atmosphere in a humidified incubator. They were split at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells/ml into 0.1 × 106 cells/ml. The P5D4 hybridoma cells produce monoclonal antibodies against the cytosolic tail of vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein (9Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The F1 hybridoma cells produce monoclonal antibodies against nascent chains and early folding intermediates of HA (10Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and the N2 hybridoma cells produce antibodies that are specific for trimerized HA (11Copeland C.S. Zimmer K.-P. Wagner K.R.

Chem. 1985; 260: 2973-2981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against X31 influenza virus immunoprecipitates all forms of HA, the viral nucleoprotein, and matrix protein (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 14Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled cysteine and methionine mixture (Promix) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. CHAPS was from Pierce, and Endo H was from New England Biolabs. Media and reagents for cell culture were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. After hybridoma cells were grown to 1.0 × 106 cells/ml, 1.0 × 107 cells per time point were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 200 × g in a Beckman GS-15 centrifuge at 4 °C, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 20 mm HEPES (pH 6.8) and 0.2% bovine serum albumin. X31 influenza virus was added at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and bound to the cell surface for 1 h at room temperature on a rocker. Cells were collected as before and resuspended in normal growth medium and incubated for 14–18 h under normal growth conditions. The cells were then washed with PBS and starved in Cys/Met-free medium (300 μl per 1.0 × 107 cells) for 30 min. Subsequently, the pulse was started by adding 500 μCi of 35S-labeled cysteine and methionine to 1.0 × 107 cells. The pulse was stopped and the chase started by adding 10 mm unlabeled cysteine and methionine and 2 mm cycloheximide to inhibit further translation (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). After the pulse or after additional periods of chase the cells were immediately lysed. When looking for secreted components in the cell supernatant, the pulse or chase was stopped by adding 700 μl of ice-cold PBS containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and the cells were separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C. After chase or directly after pulse, cells were lysed by adding an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (4% CHAPS, 100 mm HEPES, 400 mm NaCl (pH 7.6)) containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 20 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin) and 20 mmNEM to alkylate any remaining free sulfhydryl groups. When the cells were separated from their medium, they were lysed in 1× lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and 20 mm NEM. A postnuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifuging the lysates at 16,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. 150 μl of the postnuclear supernatant was incubated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (15-μl bead volume) and rotated at 4 °C for at least 3 h in the presence or absence of 5 μl of anti-influenza antiserum. Immune complexes were pelleted at 2,500 × g for 2 min and washed with agitation three times for 5 min each. In the case of immunoprecipitation with protein A only, the immune complexes were washed with a wash buffer containing 0.5% CHAPS/HEPES-buffered saline (200 mm NaCl and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6)) and in the case of anti-influenza immunoprecipitation, with wash buffer containing 10 mmTris-Cl (pH 6.8), 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The washed complexes were solubilized by the addition of nonreducing sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol) and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. For reducing conditions, 125 mm dithiothreitol was added to the samples. The samples were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE on 10.5-cm gels followed by fluorography. Anti-influenza immunoprecipitates from pulse-chased, influenza-infected hybridoma cells were washed three times as above. The immune complexes were resuspended in 0.2% SDS in 100 mm NaOAc (pH 5.5) and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. An equal volume of 100 mmNaOAc (pH 5.5) was added and the samples were divided in two. To one half of the samples only buffer was added and to the other half, buffer plus 0.5 unit of Endo H (15Hebert D.N. Zhang J.-X. Chen W. Foellmer B. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 613-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Digestions were stopped by the addition of reducing sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE on 10.5-cm gels followed by fluorography. Analysis of NEM-alkylated folding intermediates extracted from cultured cells has shown that folding of HA (a type I membrane glycoprotein, 84 kDa) starts co-translationally and continues posttranslationally in the lumen of the ER (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 10Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). 10–30 min after chain completion, when the molecules have acquired six intrachain disulfide bonds, they assemble into homotrimers and are transported out of the ER to the Golgi complex (12Tatu U. Hammond C. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 16Gething M.-J. Doms R.W. York D. White J. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). To analyze the folding process, immunoprecipitations of detergent-extracted, pulse-labeled HA have been performed using conformation-specific antibodies, and mobility differences between differentially oxidized intermediates have been monitored by SDS-PAGE (17Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The panel of antibodies used included monoclonals that react specifically with differentially oxidized early forms of HA, fully oxidized HA forms, and HA trimers. As indicated by the immunoprecipitation, some of the epitopes were expressed transiently during the folding process (17Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and some were detected already on growing nascent chains (10Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine whether the epitopes that these antibodies react with are actually present on the molecules during folding inside the ER, HA was expressed in the hybridoma cells that produced the antibodies. Like HA, the antibodies fold and assemble inside the ER lumen and can react with their antigens within this compartment (18Greber U.F. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 116: 15-30Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Control experiments were first performed using a hybridoma cell line that produces antibodies that do not interact with HA. The cell line was P5D4, a hybridoma line that produces antibodies against the cytosolic tail of vesicular stomatitis virus G-protein (9Kreis T.E. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 931-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The cells were infected with the X31 strain of influenza virus using a procedure previously described for Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In the case of Chinese hamster ovary cells, optimal HA expression is achieved 5 h postinfection. However, in hybridoma cells the cytopathic effects started 24 h postinfection, and optimal expression of HA was reached at 14–18 h after infection. As detected by indirect immunofluorescence, 90% of the cells were infected. At 18 h postinfection, the P5D4 cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min with 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine and chased for 0–40 min. As a control, infected and mock-infected cells were pulse-labeled for 15 min and chased for 40 min. After the pulse or after the chase, the cells were lysed with detergent in the presence of 20 mm NEM to alkylate the free sulfhydryl groups and prevent further disulfide bond formation (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Postnuclear supernatants were immunoprecipitated using anti-influenza antibodies and analyzed by nonreducing and reducing SDS-PAGE. Folding of HA proceeds via two easily recognized intermediates, IT1 and IT2, that differ in the number of intrachain disulfide bonds. IT1 contains one or more of the small disulfide loops but lacks both of the major loop-forming disulfides, 14–466 and 52–277. IT2 has disulfide 52–277, but lacks disulfide loop 14–466. 2I. Braakman and A. Helenius, manuscript in preparation. Soon after reaching the fully oxidized form (NT), HA trimerizes and is transported to the Golgi complex where the N-linked glycans undergo terminal glycosylation. The results showed that after a 5-min pulse all three forms, IT1, IT2, and NT, were present (Fig. 1, lane 3). The asterisk marks IT2, which has a slightly lower mobility than the Golgi form (lane 2 or 5). The mobility of NT, the fastest moving of the HA bands, increased during the chase. This is an effect caused by the trimming of glucose and mannose residues from the six core oligosaccharide chains (19Tatu U. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The Golgi form only became visible at later chase times (Fig. 1,lanes 3–5). In nonreduced gels, it had a mobility almost similar to IT2 but was easily distinguished after reduction by a lower mobility, due to the extra sugars added during terminal glycosylation. The changes in gel pattern showed that HA folded normally in hybridoma cells and that about half of it reached the Golgi compartment within 40 min, which corresponds to the rate of maturation seen in Chinese hamster ovary cells (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Labeled antibody bands were also present in both the reduced (indicated by mAb in Fig. 1) and nonreduced gels (not shown). Thus, the production of antibodies did not interfere with the process of normal HA folding in the ER. To test whether synthesis of antibodies specifically targeted against HA would affect HA folding and transport, a hybridoma cell line, F1, was chosen. F1 antibodies react with an epitope in the stem domain of HA (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation indicates that the F1 epitope is transient; it is expressed on full-length and nascent HA molecules that are present in the IT1 and IT2 forms but not at later stages of maturation (7Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 10Chen W. Helenius J. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6229-6233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 A shows that, in contrast to the P5D4 cell control (lane markedP5D4), the HA produced in F1 cells failed to fold properly. In nonreduced gels, the HA ran as a smear with a mobility slower or equal to that of IT2 (lanes 2–5). No NT was formed. Apparently, formation of the correct intrachain disulfide bonds was disturbed. Furthermore, in the reduced gel (Fig. 2 A), no Golgi form appeared, indicating that the glycans did not undergo terminal glycosylation (cf. Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 10 with Fig. 1, lanes 7 and10). This implied that the HA was trapped in the ER as a result of interaction with the antibody. To confirm that the HA was retained in the ER in the F1 cells, its Endo H sensitivity was determined. Although the HA signal was weak in the F1 cells, it was apparent that it remained Endo H-sensitive throughout the chase, in contrast to the HA in P5D4 cells (Fig.3), half of which reached an Endo H-resistant form within 40 min. The uninhibited secretion of antibodies into the medium proved that the inhibition of intracellular transport of HA was not caused by a general defect in the secretory pathway (Fig.4).Figure 4Antibody secretion by X31-infected F1 cells. F1 cells were infected and pulse-chased as described in the previous figure legends. However, after the chase, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 20 mm NEM. The cells were analyzed for their ability to secrete soluble antibodies by immunoprecipitating the cell supernatant with protein A beads. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed for radiolabeled antibodies by reducing 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. mAb, monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To show more directly that the F1 antibodies produced in the ER were the cause of the disturbed folding, we examined whether they were bound to the pulse-labeled HA. To bring down cellular immune complexes, we precipitated cell lysates with protein A-coated beads without added antibodies. The labeled HA was precipitated, revealing the same smeary pattern in nonreduced gels as seen with immunoprecipitation using the anti-influenza antiserum (Fig. 2 B). During the chase, the amount of radiolabeled HA complexed to antibodies decreased (cf. lane 5 or 10 with 4 or 9, respectively). Although we do not know the reason for this decrease (it might be that the interaction between antibody and HA is transient), these results indicated that at least a fraction of the endogenous anti-HA antibodies were, indeed, bound to incompletely or incorrectly folded HA molecules. We concluded that F1 antibodies were able to bind to the HA molecules inside the lumen of the ER and that the binding effectively interfered with normal folding and transport. Instead of trapping HA intermediates in the familiar IT1 and IT2 forms, the antibodies caused the formation of a more heterogeneous set of intermediates than normally seen in cell lysates. The antibodies were clearly able to interfere with proper maturation and transport of the newly synthesized HA. We then asked whether retention of HA in the ER could also be observed when antibodies were complexed to fully folded HA molecules. For this we used the N2 hybridoma cells that produce antibodies specific for fully folded HA trimers (14Copeland C.S. Doms R.W. Bolzau E.M. Webster R.G. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1179-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 A, HA folded normally to NT in N2 cells,and a large fraction was transported to the Golgi complex where it was terminally glycosylated. Precipitation with protein A-coated beads without added antibodies only brought down the terminally glycosylated Golgi intermediates, indicating that only late forms of HA bound to the antibodies (Fig. 5 B). It has previously been demonstrated that the majority of the HA subunits trimerize already in the ER (12Tatu U. Hammond C. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1340-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This suggests that HA trimers associated with N2 antibodies in the ER were able to move to the Golgi complex. The retention of HA in F1 hybridoma cells is therefore most likely not caused by the antibody-antigen complex formation but by misfolding of HA. Thus, association with an antibody as such may not be the cause of HA retention in the ER but rather the effect it has on the antigen's folding and maturation. The approach taken was to use the ER lumen of the hybridoma cell as a “reaction vessel” in which antigens and antibodies were mixed under unperturbed, physiological conditions. The antigens in this case were nascent and newly synthesized HA glycoproteins. Because HA was continuously being translated and translocated into the ER, it was presented to the antibodies in all the different conformations that folding chains normally display within the authentic, lumenal ER environment. On the basis of prior immunoprecipitation data, the hybridoma cells were chosen so that the antibodies were expected to react with nascent chains and early folding intermediates or with fully folded molecules. In both cases, immune complexes were formed. In the case of antibodies against nascent chains and early folding intermediates, it was clear that the immune complexes formed in the ER because no Golgi modifications could be observed in the HA. The antibodies that reacted specifically with early intermediates of HA were found to disturb folding and intracellular transport. The antibodies to the mature trimeric HA had no effect on folding or intracellular transport. The effects of the antibodies were likely to be caused by antibody-induced misfolding. Attachment of a bulky IgG molecule to the F1 epitope on a growing nascent chain or newly synthesized full-length HA molecule would limit the freedom of the folding chain and prevent interactions with molecular chaperones and folding enzymes. This would result in the formation of incorrectly oxidized, non-native conformers retained in the ER by the quality control system. Alternatively, the presence of HA bands that have not been seen previously could mean that folding of HA does not have as distinct a set of intermediates as suggested by previous data. Another conclusion that can be drawn from these results is that the conformational epitopes identified by immunoprecipitation using solubilized folding intermediates of HA were also present in the protein during in situ folding. Among the three cell lines tested, we did not find a single case in which a specific epitope would not cause antibody binding. This suggested that, at least as far as HA is concerned, the emerging picture of in vivo folding based on the pulse-chase approach is on the right track. Expression of specific antibodies has been used in the past to block the formation of functional nuclear pores and to identify the location of antigens in the Golgi complex (18Greber U.F. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 116: 15-30Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 20Burke B. Warren G. Cell. 1984; 36: 847-856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In these studies the hybridoma cells were not used directly, but the mRNA for the heavy and light chains of an antibody were microinjected into tissue culture cells. More recently, studies have been performed in which single-chain antibodies were expressed intracellularly and targeted to specific compartments using specifically designed vectors (21Persic L. Righi M. Roberts A. Hoogenboom H.R. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 187: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Biocca S. Cattaneo A. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 248-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In one study, the ER-targeted single-chain antibodies were shown to interfere with the post-ER cleavage of human immunodeficiency virus, type I gp160, indicating that the antigen was retained in the ER (23Zhou P. Goldstein S. Devadas K. Tewari D. Notkins A.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1489-1496PubMed Google Scholar). However, it is very likely that this retention was caused by the ER retention signal on the antibody and not by misfolding of the antigen. From the results described here, it is clear that antibodies can be successfully used to analyze protein folding in the ER of living cells and for targeted interference with the maturation of specific antigens. In the future, one might be able to screen single-chain antibody libraries (24McCafferty J. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Chiswell D.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 552-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar) expressed intracellularly for the identification of new factors (antigens) that affect folding of proteins in the ER.
