https://openalex.org/W2610080502,"Cereal grasses of the Triticeae tribe have been the major food source in temperate regions since the dawn of agriculture. Their large genomes are characterized by a high content of repetitive elements and large pericentromeric regions that are virtually devoid of meiotic recombination. Here we present a high-quality reference genome assembly for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). We use chromosome conformation capture mapping to derive the linear order of sequences across the pericentromeric space and to investigate the spatial organization of chromatin in the nucleus at megabase resolution. The composition of genes and repetitive elements differs between distal and proximal regions. Gene family analyses reveal lineage-specific duplications of genes involved in the transport of nutrients to developing seeds and the mobilization of carbohydrates in grains. We demonstrate the importance of the barley reference sequence for breeding by inspecting the genomic partitioning of sequence variation in modern elite germplasm, highlighting regions vulnerable to genetic erosion. The International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium reports sequencing and assembly of a reference genome for barley, Hordeum vulgare. Triticeae grasses, which include barley, wheat and rye, are widely cultivated plants with particularly complex genomes and evolutionary histories. Sequencing of the barley genome has been particularly challenging owing to its large size and particular genomic features, such as an abundance of repetitive elements. Nils Stein and colleagues of the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium report sequencing and assembly of a reference genome for barley (Hordeumvulgare L). They use a combined approach of hierarchical shotgun sequencing of bacterial artificial chromosomes, genome mapping on nanochannel arrays and chromosome-scale scaffolding with Hi-C sequencing. This brings the first comprehensive, completely ordered assembly of the pericentromeric regions of a Triticeae genome. The authors also sequenced and examined genetic diversity in the exomes of 96 European elite barley lines with a spring or winter growth habit, and highlight the utility of this resource for cereal genomics and breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2609122325,"Since 1982, extreme daily rainfall in the western Sahel has increased persistently, owing to a warmer Sahara which has led to increased wind shear and an increase in intense storms. A warming climate is expected to increase the frequency of extreme rainfall events because warmer air can support higher humidity, but other mechanisms may also be at work. Christopher Taylor et al. show that increases in extreme rainfall in the western Sahel region of Africa since 1982 are driven by a larger gradient in temperature across the region caused by a warmer Sahara desert to the north. In turn, the sharper gradient increases wind shear and seems to have led to the frequency of mesoscale convective systems—which are exactly the kind of weather systems likely to generate extreme rainfall—tripling since 1982. The spatial patterns of global warming are likely to further increase the temperature gradient and intensify mesoscale convective systems, leading to more extreme rainfall events. The hydrological cycle is expected to intensify under global warming1, with studies reporting more frequent extreme rain events in many regions of the world2,3,4, and predicting increases in future flood frequency5. Such early, predominantly mid-latitude observations are essential because of shortcomings within climate models in their depiction of convective rainfall6,7. A globally important group of intense storms—mesoscale convective systems (MCSs)8—poses a particular challenge, because they organize dynamically on spatial scales that cannot be resolved by conventional climate models. Here, we use 35 years of satellite observations from the West African Sahel to reveal a persistent increase in the frequency of the most intense MCSs. Sahelian storms are some of the most powerful on the planet9, and rain gauges in this region have recorded a rise in ‘extreme’17 daily rainfall totals. We find that intense MCS frequency is only weakly related to the multidecadal recovery of Sahel annual rainfall, but is highly correlated with global land temperatures. Analysis of trends across Africa reveals that MCS intensification is limited to a narrow band south of the Sahara desert. During this period, wet-season Sahelian temperatures have not risen, ruling out the possibility that rainfall has intensified in response to locally warmer conditions. On the other hand, the meridional temperature gradient spanning the Sahel has increased in recent decades, consistent with anthropogenic forcing driving enhanced Saharan warming10. We argue that Saharan warming intensifies convection within Sahelian MCSs through increased wind shear and changes to the Saharan air layer. The meridional gradient is projected to strengthen throughout the twenty-first century, suggesting that the Sahel will experience particularly marked increases in extreme rain. The remarkably rapid intensification of Sahelian MCSs since the 1980s sheds new light on the response of organized tropical convection to global warming, and challenges conventional projections made by general circulation models."

https://openalex.org/W2608857595,"Magnetically driven eruptions on the Sun, from stellar-scale coronal mass ejections to small-scale coronal X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet jets, have frequently been observed to involve the ejection of the highly stressed magnetic flux of a filament. Theoretically, these two phenomena have been thought to arise through very different mechanisms: coronal mass ejections from an ideal (non-dissipative) process, whereby the energy release does not require a change in the magnetic topology, as in the kink or torus instability; and coronal jets from a resistive process involving magnetic reconnection. However, it was recently concluded from new observations that all coronal jets are driven by filament ejection, just like large mass ejections. This suggests that the two phenomena have physically identical origin and hence that a single mechanism may be responsible, that is, either mass ejections arise from reconnection, or jets arise from an ideal instability. Here we report simulations of a coronal jet driven by filament ejection, whereby a region of highly sheared magnetic field near the solar surface becomes unstable and erupts. The results show that magnetic reconnection causes the energy release via 'magnetic breakout'-a positive-feedback mechanism between filament ejection and reconnection. We conclude that if coronal mass ejections and jets are indeed of physically identical origin (although on different spatial scales) then magnetic reconnection (rather than an ideal process) must also underlie mass ejections, and that magnetic breakout is a universal model for solar eruptions."

There is evidence that alterations in synchronous neural activity between brain regions subserving reward and various cognitive functions may significantly contribute to substance-related disorders. This study presents the first evidence showing that a pro-dopaminergic nutraceutical (KB220Z) significantly enhances, above placebo, functional connectivity between reward and cognitive brain areas in the rat. These include the nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate gyrus, anterior thalamic nuclei, hippocampus, prelimbic and infralimbic loci. Significant functional connectivity, increased brain connectivity volume recruitment (potentially neuroplasticity), and dopaminergic functionality were found across the brain reward circuitry. Increases in functional connectivity were specific to these regions and were not broadly distributed across the brain. While these initial findings have been observed in drug naïve rodents, this robust, yet selective response implies clinical relevance for addicted individuals at risk for relapse, who show reductions in functional connectivity after protracted withdrawal. Future studies will evaluate KB220Z in animal models of addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2609766695,"Episodes of mass coral bleaching have been reported in recent decades and have raised concerns about the future of coral reefs on a warming planet. Despite the efforts to enhance and coordinate coral reef monitoring within and across countries, our knowledge of the geographic extent of mass coral bleaching over the past few decades is incomplete. Existing databases, like ReefBase, are limited by the voluntary nature of contributions, geographical biases in data collection, and the variations in the spatial scale of bleaching reports. In this study, we have developed the first-ever gridded, global-scale historical coral bleaching database. First, we conducted a targeted search for bleaching reports not included in ReefBase by personally contacting scientists and divers conducting monitoring in under-reported locations and by extracting data from the literature. This search increased the number of observed bleaching reports by 79%, from 4146 to 7429. Second, we employed spatial interpolation techniques to develop annual 0.04° × 0.04° latitude-longitude global maps of the probability that bleaching occurred for 1985 through 2010. Initial results indicate that the area of coral reefs with a more likely than not (>50%) or likely (>66%) probability of bleaching was eight times higher in the second half of the assessed time period, after the 1997/1998 El Niño. The results also indicate that annual maximum Degree Heating Weeks, a measure of thermal stress, for coral reefs with a high probability of bleaching increased over time. The database will help the scientific community more accurately assess the change in the frequency of mass coral bleaching events, validate methods of predicting mass coral bleaching, and test whether coral reefs are adjusting to rising ocean temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2608038063,"Introduction Electronic health (eHealth) strategies are evolving making it important to have valid scales to assess eHealth and health literacy. Item response theory methods, such as the Rasch measurement model, are increasingly used for the psychometric evaluation of scales. This paper aims to examine the internal construct validity of an eHealth and health literacy scale using Rasch analysis in a population with moderate to high cardiovascular disease risk. Methods The first 397 participants of the CONNECT study completed the electronic health Literacy Scale (eHEALS) and the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ). Overall Rasch model fit as well as five key psychometric properties were analysed: unidimensionality, response thresholds, targeting, differential item functioning and internal consistency. Results The eHEALS had good overall model fit (χ2 = 54.8, p = 0.06), ordered response thresholds, reasonable targeting and good internal consistency (person separation index (PSI) 0.90). It did, however, appear to measure two constructs of eHealth literacy. The HLQ subscales (except subscale 5) did not fit the Rasch model (χ2: 18.18–60.60, p: 0.00–0.58) and had suboptimal targeting for most subscales. Subscales 6 to 9 displayed disordered thresholds indicating participants had difficulty distinguishing between response options. All subscales did, nonetheless, demonstrate moderate to good internal consistency (PSI: 0.62–0.82). Conclusion Rasch analyses demonstrated that the eHEALS has good measures of internal construct validity although it appears to capture different aspects of eHealth literacy (e.g. using eHealth and understanding eHealth). Whilst further studies are required to confirm this finding, it may be necessary for these constructs of the eHEALS to be scored separately. The nine HLQ subscales were shown to measure a single construct of health literacy. However, participants’ scores may not represent their actual level of ability, as distinction between response categories was unclear for the last four subscales. Reducing the response categories of these subscales may improve the ability of the HLQ to distinguish between different levels of health literacy."
https://openalex.org/W2608955209,"Coral-algal phase shifts in which coral cover declines to low levels and is replaced by algae have often been documented on coral reefs worldwide. This has motivated coral reef management responses that include restriction and regulation of fishing, e.g. herbivorous fish species. However, there is evidence that eutrophication and sedimentation can be at least as important as a reduction in herbivory in causing phase shifts. These threats arise from coastal development leading to increased nutrient and sediment loads, which stimulate algal growth and negatively impact corals respectively. Here, we first present results of a dynamic process-based model demonstrating that in addition to overharvesting of herbivorous fish, bottom-up processes have the potential to precipitate coral-algal phase shifts on Mesoamerican reefs. We then provide an empirical example that exemplifies this on coral reefs off Mahahual in Mexico, where a shift from coral to algal dominance occurred over 14 years, during which there was little change in herbivore biomass but considerable development of tourist infrastructure. Our results indicate that coastal development can compromise the resilience of coral reefs and that watershed and coastal zone management together with the maintenance of functional levels of fish herbivory are critical for the persistence of coral reefs in Mesoamerica."
https://openalex.org/W2604581019,"Adherence to medications is an important indicator of the quality of medication management and impacts on health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of healthcare delivery. Electronic healthcare data (EHD) are increasingly used to estimate adherence in research and clinical practice, yet standardization and transparency of data processing are still a concern. Comprehensive and flexible open-source algorithms can facilitate the development of high-quality, consistent, and reproducible evidence in this field. Some EHD-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) include visualization of medication histories, but this is rarely integrated in adherence analyses and not easily accessible for data exploration or implementation in new clinical settings. We introduce AdhereR, a package for the widely used open-source statistical environment R, designed to support researchers in computing EHD-based adherence estimates and in visualizing individual medication histories and adherence patterns. AdhereR implements a set of functions that are consistent with current adherence guidelines, definitions and operationalizations. We illustrate the use of AdhereR with an example dataset of 2-year records of 100 patients and describe the various analysis choices possible and how they can be adapted to different health conditions and types of medications. The package is freely available for use and its implementation facilitates the integration of medication history visualizations in open-source CDSS platforms."
https://openalex.org/W2608530549,"Rivers sourced in the Himalayan mountain range carry some of the largest sediment loads on the planet, yet coarse gravel in these rivers vanishes within approximately 10-40 kilometres on entering the Ganga Plain (the part of the North Indian River Plain containing the Ganges River). Understanding the fate of gravel is important for forecasting the response of rivers to large influxes of sediment triggered by earthquakes or storms. Rapid increase in gravel flux and subsequent channel bed aggradation (that is, sediment deposition by a river) following the 1999 Chi-Chi and 2008 Wenchuan earthquakes reduced channel capacity and increased flood inundation. Here we present an analysis of fan geometry, sediment grain size and lithology in the Ganga Basin. We find that the gravel fluxes from rivers draining the central Himalayan mountains, with upstream catchment areas ranging from about 350 to 50,000 square kilometres, are comparable. Our results show that abrasion of gravel during fluvial transport can explain this observation; most of the gravel sourced more than 100 kilometres upstream is converted into sand by the time it reaches the Ganga Plain. These findings indicate that earthquake-induced sediment pulses sourced from the Greater Himalayas, such as that following the 2015 Gorkha earthquake, are unlikely to drive increased gravel aggradation at the mountain front. Instead, we suggest that the sediment influx should result in an elevated sand flux, leading to distinct patterns of aggradation and flood risk in the densely populated, low-relief Ganga Plain."

The role of Hap10 in BD pathogenesis is unknown. We sought to define the effects of Hap10 on the HLA-B*51 peptidome and to distinguish these effects from those due to HLA-B*51 polymorphisms unrelated to disease. The peptidome of the BD-associated HLA-B*51:08 subtype expressed in a Hap10-positive cell line was isolated, characterized by mass spectrometry, and compared with the HLA-B*51:01 peptidome from cells expressing more active ERAP1 allotypes. We additionally performed synthetic peptide digestions with recombinant ERAP1 variants and estimated peptide-binding affinity with standard algorithms. In the BD-associated ERAP1 context of B*51:08, longer peptides were generated; of the two major HLA-B*51 subpeptidomes with Pro-2 and Ala-2, the former one was significantly reduced, and the latter was increased and showed more ERAP1-susceptible N-terminal residues. These effects were readily explained by the low activity of Hap10 and the differential susceptibility of X–Pro and X–Ala bonds to ERAP1 trimming and together resulted in a significantly altered peptidome with lower affinity. The differences due to ERAP1 were clearly distinguished from those due to HLA-B*51 subtype polymorphism, which affected residue frequencies at internal positions of the peptide ligands.

The peptidome of HLA-B*51:01 consists mainly of two subpeptidomes, one with Ala at peptide position 2 (P2) (Ala-2), which confers relatively lower affinity for HLA-B*51:01, and one with Pro-2 and higher affinity (25Guasp P.

In the present study, we analyzed the peptidome presented by HLA-B*51:08 in a B lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) expressing the BD-associated Hap10 variant of ERAP1. To assess the effect of this ERAP1 context, as well as the effect of polymorphism between two BD-associated subtypes, on the HLA-B*51 peptidome, the B*51:08 ligands were compared with those of HLA-B*51:01 generated in a more active ERAP1 background and identified in our previous study (25Guasp P.

Using this approach, we addressed two issues concerning the relationship between antigen processing and presentation by HLA-B*51 and BD: 1) the effects of the BD-associated ERAP1 variant on the HLA-B*51 peptidome and 2) how this peptidome is affected by polymorphism between two BD-associated B*51 subtypes. The differences observed allowed us to establish the effects of ERAP1 on the HLA-B*51 peptidome and to distinguish them from those due to subtype polymorphism. BCH-30 was homozygous for the BD-associated Hap10 variant of ERAP1. It was heterozygous for ERAP2, although only the Lys-392 allotype of ERAP2 is expressed due to linkage disequilibrium of the Asn-392 variant with a polymorphism (rs2248374) that impairs the expression of the protein (26Andrés A.M.

These peptides included the ligands of all of the MHC-I molecules in this cell line, due to the lack of allotypic and locus specificity of W6/32. Peptides with 8–12 residues (n = 4502) were selected. B*51:08 ligands were assigned on the basis of the major B*51 motif defined in our previous study (25Guasp P. Alvarez-Navarro C. Gomez-Molina P. Martín-Esteban A. Marcilla M. Barnea E. Admon A. López de Castro J.A.

After restricting for the combined P2+PΩ motif, 624 peptides were reliably assigned as B*51:08 ligands (supplemental Table S2). When the same filter was applied to the 1620 B*51:01 ligands from 721.221-B*51:01 cells (25Guasp P. Alvarez-Navarro C. Gomez-Molina P. Martín-Esteban A. Marcilla M. Barnea E. Admon A. López de Castro J.A. The peptidome of the Behçet's disease-associated HLA-B*51:01 includes two sub-peptidomes differentially shaped by ERAP1.Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016; 68: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), 1271 peptides (78.5%) remained, indicating that this stringent filtering selected the majority of the HLA-B*51 peptidome. Peptides lacking this motif could not be reliably assigned as B*51:08 ligands and were excluded. Among these excluded peptides, 1188 and 1479 could be assigned as A*02:01 or B*40:01 ligands on the basis of the major motifs of these allotypes: Leu/Met at P2 + Leu/Val/Ile at PΩ for A*02:01 and Glu at P2 + Leu at PΩ (Immunoepitope database). The lower number of B*51:08 ligands may be partially a consequence of the stringent filtering applied but also due to the tendency of this allotype to be expressed at the cell surface at lower levels, compared with other MHC-I molecules (25Guasp P. Alvarez-Navarro C. Gomez-Molina P. Martín-Esteban A. Marcilla M. Barnea E. Admon A. López de Castro J.A. The peptidome of the Behçet's disease-associated HLA-B*51:01 includes two sub-peptidomes differentially shaped by ERAP1.Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016; 68: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The peptides assigned to either A*02:01 or B*40:01 showed much higher affinity for their cognate molecule than for the other HLA-A,B molecules expressed in BCH-30 cells (supplemental Fig. S1), confirming the reliability of the assignments. In subsequent analyses, B*51:08 ligands with Pro/Ala at P2 and Val/Ile at PΩ were compared with the B*51:01 ligands from 721.221-B*51:01 cells showing the same motif. The B*51:08 ligands from BCH-30 consisted of 13.6% 8-mers, 77.9% 9-mers, 4.2% 10-mers, and 4.3% longer peptides. When compared with those of B*51:01 from 721.221-B*51:01 cells, a significantly lower percentage of 8-mers and a corresponding increase of 9-mers was observed both in the whole B*51:08 peptide set and in the Pro-2 and Ala-2 subpeptidomes (Fig. 2, A and B). The B*51:08 ligands from BCH-30 showed 45.7% Pro and 54.3% Ala at P2 (Pro-2/Ala-2 ratio of 0.84). This was in strong contrast to the B*51:01 ligands from 721.221 cells: 65.5% Pro-2 and 34.5% Ala-2 (Pro-2/Ala-2 ratio of 1.9). This large difference (Fig. 2C) can hardly be explained by the amino acid changes between B*51:01 and B*51:08 because these are located away from the B pocket. However, the distinct activity of the ERAP1 variants in BCH-30 and 721.221 cells may account for the observed differences. In particular, peptides with Pro-2 are not degraded by ERAP1, regardless of the activity of the enzymatic variant, whereas peptides with Ala-2 could be more extensively overtrimmed by the more active variants in 721.221 cells, compared with BCH-30. To further support that the distinct residue usage at P2 is due to differences in ERAP1 activity, 12 synthetic precursors of HLA-B*51 ligands with two N-terminal extensions were digested in vitro with three recombinant ERAP1 variants: Hap2 (high activity), Hap8 (intermediate activity), and Hap10 (low activity). Hap8 and Hap10 are expressed in 721.221 and BCH-30 cells, respectively. Hap2 is functionally undistinguishable from Hap1 (28Martín-Esteban A. Guasp P. Barnea E. Admon A. López de Castro J.A. Functional interaction of the ankylosing spondylitis associated endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 with the HLA-B*27 peptidome in human cells.Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016; 68: 2466-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which is also expressed in 721.221 cells. Ligands with Pro-2 were generated, but not destroyed, by Hap2, Hap8, and Hap10 in all six cases analyzed. For five of the six substrates, generation of the ligand was faster with Hap2 and Hap8 than with Hap10. It reached 100% in all cases with the two former variants and only in three of the six ligands with Hap10 (Fig. 3A). Ligands with Ala-2 were generated, but also destroyed to various extents, by all three ERAP1 variants. The time course of their generation/destruction balance was variant and peptide-dependent, but in five of six peptides, the yield of the ligand at the largest time analyzed was higher with Hap10, due to more overtrimming with the Hap2 and Hap8 enzymes. Only in one case (SA.IAKQEDVSV) (where the dot separates the two N-terminal extensions, as present in the parental proteins, from the sequence of the natural ligand) did the generation of the ligand prevail over its destruction and result in higher yields with Hap2 and Hap8 than with Hap10 at all times (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that peptides with Pro-2 are less efficiently generated by the low activity Hap10 variant than by the more active ones. In contrast, at least at long digestion times, most peptides with Ala-2 are produced with higher yield by the less active variant. This pattern reproduces the one found in live cells, where the Ala-2 prevails over the Pro-2 subpeptidome in the Hap10 context of BCH-30, whereas the Pro-2 subpeptidome prevails over the Ala-2 one in the more active ERAP1 context of 721.221 cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, in vitro digestions strongly support that the large differences in the relative amounts of the Pro-2 and Ala-2 subpeptidomes found between B*51:08 and B*51:01 ligands are essentially determined by ERAP1. In our previous study (25Guasp P. Alvarez-Navarro C. Gomez-Molina P. Martín-Esteban A. Marcilla M. Barnea E. Admon A. López de Castro J.A. The peptidome of the Behçet's disease-associated HLA-B*51:01 includes two sub-peptidomes differentially shaped by ERAP1.Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016; 68: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we found that whereas B*51:01 ligands with Pro-2 showed a predominance of ERAP1-susceptible residues at P1, Ala-2 ligands showed a high frequency of ERAP1-resistant residues, mainly Asp, at this position. It was inferred that ERAP1 accounted for these differences due to its inefficient overtrimming of Ala-2 ligands with ERAP1-resistant P1 residues and to its inability to trim X–Pro bonds. Thus, P1 usage among peptides with Pro-2 should be determined by the binding preferences of HLA-B*51 and the relative amounts of the corresponding residues in the proteome, but not by their susceptibility to ERAP1 trimming. Experimental demonstration of these assumptions was provided by the analysis of B*51:08 ligands from BCH-30. Their P1 residue frequencies were similar to those found among B*51:01 ligands from 721.221 cells, except for a higher frequency of Ala-1, an ERAP1-susceptible residue, in B*51:08 (Fig. 4A). The Pro-2 subpeptidomes showed no differences, indicating a lack of effect of either ERAP1 activity or subtype polymorphism on this position. The Ala-2 subpeptidome of B*51:08 and B*51:01 also showed similar patterns of residue usage, including a high frequency of Asp-1, albeit lower among B*51:08 ligands, and an increased frequency of Ala-1 in B*51:08, which accounted for that in the total peptidome. When grouped according to their ERAP1 susceptibility (Fig. 4B), a statistically significant increase of susceptible P1 residues and a corresponding decrease of resistant ones were found among B*51:08 ligands with Ala-2, relative to B*51:01. Thus, the low-activity ERAP1 context of BCH-30 cells resulted in less destruction of HLA-B*51 ligands with Ala-2 and ERAP1-susceptible P1 residues, relative to the more active context of 721.221 cells. The results reveal a significant effect of ERAP1 polymorphism on shaping the Ala-2, but not the Pro2, subpeptidomes of HLA-B*51 through differential processing of N-terminal residues. The Pro-2 subpeptidome of B*51:08 showed higher affinity than the Ala-2 counterpart (Fig. 5A), as also observed in HLA-B*51:01, both theoretically (25Guasp P. Alvarez-Navarro C. Gomez-Molina P. Martín-Esteban A. Marcilla M. Barnea E. Admon A. López de Castro J.A. The peptidome of the Behçet's disease-associated HLA-B*51:01 includes two sub-peptidomes differentially shaped by ERAP1.Arthritis Rheumatol. 2016; 68: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and experimentally (29Sakaguchi T. Ibe M. Miwa K. Kaneko Y. Yokota S. Tanaka K. Takiguchi M.

The overall affinity of B*51:08 ligands from BCH-30 was significantly lower than that of B*51:01 ligands from 721.221 cells for its corresponding subtype (Fig. 5B). This difference was accounted for by the higher percentage of Ala-2 peptides in B*51:08, compared with B*51:01, and was therefore determined by the low activity of the Hap10 variant of ERAP1 in BCH-30 cells. The correspondence between theoretical and experimentally determined affinity values was assessed with a number of HLA-B*51 ligands whose experimental affinity for B*51:01 had been determined in earlier studies (29Sakaguchi T. Ibe M. Miwa K. Kaneko Y. Yokota S. Tanaka K. Takiguchi M. Binding of 8-mer to 11-mer peptides carrying the anchor residues to slow assembling HLA class I molecules (HLA-B*5101).Immunogenetics. 1997; 45: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 30Sakaguchi T.

Predominant role of N-terminal residue of nonamer peptides in their binding to HLA-B* 5101 molecules.Immunogenetics. 1997; 46: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A comparison of these experimental values with their theoretical affinity for both B*51:01 and B*51:08 (Fig. 5C) showed a good correlation. Both the theoretical and experimental affinities showed a similar distribution, although the relative affinity between two given individual peptides was not always concordant. Thus, the theoretical affinity of the peptidome, as determined here, is a valid method to assess global affinity variations among peptide sets. The following analysis was performed only with 9-mers to ensure uniform sequence alignments. A total of 486 B*51:08 and 821 B*51:01 ligands from BCH-30 and 721.221 transfectants, respectively, were compared. Residue usage at each peptide position was determined for the whole peptide sets (Fig. 6) and the Pro-2 (supplemental Fig. S2) and the Ala-2 subpeptidomes (supplemental Fig. S3). Besides P1 and P2, statistically significant differences were found at P3 and P5–P8. At P3, an increased frequency of Lys, Met, and Gln and decreased frequency of Phe and Tyr in HLA-B*51:08, relative to B*51:01, was observed both with all of the 9-mers (Fig. 6) and in the Pro-2 subset (supplemental Fig. S2). Only the differences in Lys, Phe, and Tyr reached statistical significance in the Ala-2 subpeptidome (supplemental Fig. S3). Because the P3 position can be properly aligned among peptides of different lengths, this analysis was also performed using all B*51 ligands, with very similar results. Differential P3 frequencies were related to both the size and chemical nature of the side chains (supplemental Fig. S4); smaller and hydrophilic residues were more frequent in B*51:08. Ile-5, Val-5, Val-6, His-7, and Ala-8 were increased, whereas Pro-7 and Leu-8 were decreased, in B*51:08, relative to B*51:01 (Fig. 6). Most of these differences also reached statistical significance in the Pro-2 or Ala-2 subpeptidomes. In addition, Val-7 and Lys-7 were statistically increased only in the Pro-2 and Ala-2 subpeptidomes of B*51:08, respectively (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). To discern whether the observed changes at P5–P8 resulted directly from the polymorphism between B*51:01 and B*51:08 or were due to ERAP1-dependent alterations in the Pro-2/Ala-2 subpeptidomes, we compared the residue frequencies of the nonameric Pro-2 with Ala-2 subpeptidomes within each subtype. As observed previously (25Guasp P. Alvarez-Navarro C. Gomez-Molina P. Martín-Esteban A. Marcilla M. Barnea E. Admon A. López de Castro J.A.

Reduced RNA quality caused by degradation is an established source of uncertainty for all RNA-based gene expression quantification techniques. RNA sequencing is an increasingly preferred method for transcriptome analyses, and dependence of its results on input RNA integrity is of significant practical importance. This study aimed to characterize the effects of varying input RNA integrity [estimated as RNA integrity number (RIN)] on transcript level estimates and delineate the characteristic differences between transcripts that differ in degradation rate. The study used ribodepleted total RNA sequencing data from a real-life clinically collected set (n = 32) of human solid tissue (placenta) samples. RIN-dependent alterations in gene expression profiles were quantified by using DESeq2 software. Our results indicate that small differences in RNA integrity affect gene expression quantification by introducing a moderate and pervasive bias in expression level estimates that significantly affected 8.1% of studied genes. The rapidly degrading transcript pool was enriched in pseudogenes, short noncoding RNAs, and transcripts with extended 3' untranslated regions. Typical slowly degrading transcripts (median length, 2389 nt) represented protein coding genes with 4-10 exons and high guanine-cytosine content.-Reiman, M., Laan, M., Rull, K., Sõber, S.

In the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a vector of dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika viruses, the metabolic tissue (the fat body, which is an analogue of the vertebrate liver) produces yolk proteins for developing oocytes. JH is important for the fat body to acquire competence for yolk protein production. However, the molecular mechanisms of how JH promotes mosquito reproduction are not completely understood. In this study we show that stimulation of the JH receptor methoprene-tolerant (Met) activates expression of genes encoding the regulator of ribosome synthesis 1 (RRS1) and six ribosomal proteins (two ribosomal large subunit proteins, two ribosomal small subunit proteins, and two mitochondrial ribosomal proteins). Moreover, RNAi-mediated depletion of RRS1 decreased biosynthesis of the ribosomal protein L32 (RpL32). Depletion of Met, RRS1, or RpL32 led to retardation of ovarian growth and reduced mosquito fecundity, which may at least in part have resulted from decreased vitellogenin protein production in the fat body. In summary, our results indicate that JH is critical for inducing the expression of ribosomal protein genes and demonstrate that RRS1 mediates the JH signal to enhance both ribosomal biogenesis and vitellogenesis."

The aim of this study was to identify predictors for employment 12 months after transplantation in kidney patients, applying a bio-psycho-social model. Methods All kidney patients followed in the Swiss Transplant Cohort between May 2008 and December 2012, aged 18 to 65 were assessed before, 6 and 12 months after transplantation. Results Of the 689 included patients, 56.2% worked 12 months post- transplantation compared to 58.9% pre-transplantation. Age, education, self-perceived health (6 months post- transplantation), pre- transplantation employment and receiving an organ from a living donor are significant predictors of employment post- transplantation. Moreover, while self-perceived health increased post- transplantation, depression score decreased only among those employed 12 months post- transplantation. Pre- transplantation employment status was the main predictor for post- transplantation employment (OR = 18.6) and was associated with sex, age, education, depression and duration of dialysis. An organ from a living donor (42.1%) was more frequent in younger patients, with higher education, no diabetes and shorter waiting time to surgery. Conclusion Transplantation did not increase employment in end-stage kidney disease patients but helped maintaining employment. Pre-transplantation employment has been confirmed to be the most important predictor of post-transplantation employment. Furthermore, socio-demographic and individual factors predicted directly and indirectly the post-transplantation employment status. With living donor, an additional predictor linked to social factors and the medical procedure has been identified."

https://openalex.org/W2607900077,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic lung disorder that is characterized by aberrant tissue remodeling and the formation of fibroblastic foci that are composed of fibrogenic myofibroblasts. TGF-β1 is one of the factors that are responsible for fibrosis as it promotes fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation (FMD) and is associated with up-regulation of α-smooth muscle actin. Therefore, inhibition of FMD may represent an effective strategy for the treatment of IPF. Here, we describe the treatment of human lung fibroblasts (WI-38 and HFL-1 cells) with cyclosporine A (CsA), which reduces TGF-β1–induced FMD via degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). In addition, in primary myofibroblast-like cells that were obtained from a patient with pulmonary fibrosis, treatment with CsA and an HIF-1α inhibitor (HIFi) decreased the expression levels of α-smooth muscle actin and fibronectin, which indicated that CsA and HIFi promote dedifferentiation of myofibroblasts. In mice intratracheally administered CsA or HIFi at an early fibrotic stage [7, 8, and 9 d postinstillation (dpi) of bleomycin], marked alleviation of lung fibrosis was observed at 14 dpi. These results suggest that CsA exhibits antifibrotic effects by degrading HIF-1α and that the CsA–HIF-1α axis provides new insights into therapeutic options for the treatment of IPF.—Yamazaki, R., Kasuya, Y., Fujita, T., Umezawa, H., Yanagihara, M., Nakamura, H., Yoshino, I., Tatsumi, K., Murayama, T.

Here, to provide new insight into the molecular events leading to neurocognitive impairments (NCI) in HIV infection, we analyzed pathway dysregulations in gene expression profiles of HIV-infected patients with or without NCI and HIV encephalitis (HIVE) and control subjects. The Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) algorithm was used for pathway analyses in conjunction with the Molecular Signatures Database collection of canonical pathways (MSigDb). We analyzed pathway dysregulations in gene expression profiles of patients from the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC), which consists of samples from 3 different brain regions, including white matter, basal ganglia and frontal cortex of HIV-infected and control patients. While HIVE is characterized by widespread, uncontrolled inflammation and tissue damage, substantial gene expression evidence of induction of interferon (IFN), cytokines and tissue injury is apparent in all brain regions studied, even in the absence of NCI. Various degrees of white matter changes were present in all HIV-infected subjects and were the primary manifestation in patients with NCI in the absence of HIVE. In particular, NCI in patients without HIVE in the NNTC sample is associated with white matter expression of chemokines, cytokines and β-defensins, without significant activation of IFN. Altogether, the results identified distinct pathways differentially regulated over the course of neurological disease in HIV infection and provide a new perspective on the dynamics of pathogenic processes in the course of HIV neurological disease in humans. These results also demonstrate the power of the systems biology analyses and indicate that the establishment of larger human gene expression profile datasets will have the potential to provide novel mechanistic insight into the pathogenesis of neurological disease in HIV infection and identify better therapeutic targets for NCI."
https://openalex.org/W2608439423,"The gp120 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) protein is heavily glycosylated at ˜25 glycosylation sites, of which ˜7–8 are located in the V1/V2 and V3 variable loops and the others in the remaining core gp120 region. Glycans partially shield Env from recognition by the host immune system and also are believed to be indispensable for proper folding of gp120 and for viral infectivity. Previous attempts to alter glycosylation sites in Env typically involved mutating the glycosylated asparagine residues to structurally similar glutamines or alanines. Here, we confirmed that such mutations at multiple glycosylation sites greatly diminish viral infectivity and result in significantly reduced binding to both neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, using an alternative approach, we combined evolutionary information with structure-guided design and yeast surface display to produce properly cleaved HIV-1 Env variants that lack all 15 core gp120 glycans, yet retain conformational integrity and multiple-cycle viral infectivity and bind to several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), including trimer-specific antibodies and a germline-reverted version of the bNAb VRC01. Our observations demonstrate that core gp120 glycans are not essential for folding, and hence their likely primary role is enabling immune evasion. We also show that our glycan removal approach is not strain restricted. Glycan-deficient Env derivatives can be used as priming immunogens because they should engage and activate a more divergent set of germlines than fully glycosylated Env. In conclusion, these results clarify the role of core gp120 glycosylation and illustrate a general method for designing glycan-free folded protein derivatives.

Glycan-deficient Env derivatives can be used as priming immunogens because they should engage and activate a more divergent set of germlines than fully glycosylated Env. In conclusion, these results clarify the role of core gp120 glycosylation and illustrate a general method for designing glycan-free folded protein derivatives. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).

The gp120 glycoprotein is the primary viral component that is exposed on the virion surface and is the main target for neutralizing antibodies (2Overbaugh J. Morris L.

The OD of the HIV-1 Env glycoprotein gp120 is an important target for vaccine design as it contains the binding site for primary cellular receptor CD4 (CD4bs) and a number of conserved epitopes for various bNAbs, such as VRC01, VRC-PG04, NIH45–46, 3BNC60, b12, PGT128, and 2G12 (6Burton D.R.

Protein N-linked glycosylation of Asn residues is an important modification found in all three domains of life (22Schwarz F. Aebi M. Mechanisms and principles of N-linked protein glycosylation.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2011; 21: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, N-glycans mediate interactions of protein substrates with the protein quality control machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum. N-Glycans also directly affect protein folding, enhance stability, and prevent aggregation of proteins (23Helenius A. Aebi M. Intracellular functions of N-linked glycans.Science. 2001; 291: 2364-2369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar). Glycans constitute ˜50% of the molecular mass of gp120 (24Leonard C.K. Spellman M.W. Riddle L. Harris R.J. Thomas J.N. Gregory T.J. Assignment of intrachain disulfide bonds and characterization of potential glycosylation sites of the type 1 recombinant human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein (gp120) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10373-10382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A large number of conserved epitopes on gp120 are often shielded as the OD is heavily glycosylated (Fig. 1C) (24Leonard C.K. Spellman M.W. Riddle L. Harris R.J. Thomas J.N. Gregory T.J. Assignment of intrachain disulfide bonds and characterization of potential glycosylation sites of the type 1 recombinant human immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoprotein (gp120) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10373-10382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This masking of conserved epitopes is one of the several factors that has impeded the development of an Env-derived immunogen capable of eliciting bNAbs against HIV-1 (25Rathore U. Kesavardhana S. Mallajosyula V.V. Varadarajan R. Immunogen design for HIV-1 and influenza.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1844: 1891-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All the glycans on the viral surface are entirely derived from the host machinery. Analysis of HIV-1 gp120 shows that highly variable regions are often found adjacent to N-linked glycosylation sites. A potential role for N-linked glycans of HIV-1 Env is to facilitate the accumulation of silent mutations in the region of the gp120 surface that is occluded by glycans (26Scanlan C.N. Offer J. Zitzmann N. Dwek R.A. Exploiting the defensive sugars of HIV-1 for drug and vaccine design.Nature. 2007; 446: 1038-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, a glycan array forms a non-immunogenic cloak protecting the underlying protein surface (27Back N.K. Smit L. De Jong J.J. Keulen W. Schutten M. Goudsmit J. Tersmette M.

On average, gp120 contains ˜25 putative N-linked glycosylation sites of which ˜4 are located in the inner domain, ˜7–8 in the V1/V2 and V3 variable loops, and the rest in the outer domain of gp120 (43Zhang M.

A systematic study of the N-glycosylation sites of HIV-1 envelope protein on infectivity and antibody-mediated neutralization.Retrovirology. 2013; 10: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Apart from N-glycosylation, HIV-1 Env can also be modified with O-glycosylation, but this modification is less well characterized. A mass spectrometric study was able to identify only a single O-linked glycosylation at residue Thr-499 in the C5 region of recombinant gp120 (46Go E.P. Liao H.X. Alam S.M. Hua D. Haynes B.F. Desaire H. Characterization of host-cell line specific glycosylation profiles of early transmitted/founder HIV-1 gp120 envelope proteins.J. Proteome Res. 2013; 12: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, a recent study reported that O-linked glycosylation is absent even at residue Thr-499 in the context of HIV-1 virions (47Stansell E. Panico M. Canis K. Pang P.C. Bouché L. Binet D. O'Connor M.J. Chertova E. Bess J. Lifson J.D. Haslam S.M. Morris H.R. Desrosiers R.C. Dell A. Gp120 on HIV-1 virions lacks O-linked carbohydrate.PLoS ONE. 2015; 10e0124784Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this study, we therefore focus exclusively on N-linked glycosylation. Glycan synthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum of host cells by transfer of N-linked oligomannose precursors to the amide side chain of asparagine residues in the sequon NX(T/S) (X ≠Proline) (48Choi B.K. Bobrowicz P. Davidson R.C. Hamilton S.R. Kung D.H. Li H. Miele R.G. Nett J.H. Wildt S. Gerngross T.U.

Assembly of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is widely believed that proper glycosylation is essential for correct folding of gp120 (34Li Y. Luo L. Rasool N. Kang C.Y. Glycosylation is necessary for the correct folding of human immunodeficiency virus gp120 in CD4 binding.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 584-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no single glycosylation site is completely conserved in all HIV-1 isolates. Recently, all glycosylation sites in gp120 were individually mutated (44Pritchard L.K. Spencer D.I. Royle L. Bonomelli C. Seabright G.E. Behrens A.J. Kulp D.W. Menis S. Krumm S.A. Dunlop D.C. Crispin D.J. Bowden T.A. Scanlan C.N. Ward A.B. Schief W.R. et al.Glycan clustering stabilizes the mannose patch of HIV-1 and preserves vulnerability to broadly neutralizing antibodies.Nat. Commun. 2015; 67479Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of complete conservation, there was relatively little effect observed upon mutating individual sites both in the context of a monomer (44Pritchard L.K. Spencer D.I. Royle L. Bonomelli C. Seabright G.E. Behrens A.J. Kulp D.W. Menis S. Krumm S.A. Dunlop D.C. Crispin D.J. Bowden T.A. Scanlan C.N. Ward A.B.

However, effects of deletions of multiple glycans on Env folding have not been well studied. The ability to modulate glycan coverage is highly desirable, as it can be used to ensure selective exposure of conserved regions or unmasking of important neutralization epitopes (Fig. 1D). Glycosylation is asserted to be essential for viral infectivity (45Wang W. Nie J. Prochnow C. Truong C. Jia Z. Wang S. Chen X.S. Wang Y.

Prochnow C. Truong C. Jia Z. Wang S. Chen X.S. Wang Y.

Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 2213-2217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whenever multiple glycosylation sites were mutated in combination, it resulted in the loss of viral infectivity, which led to the hypothesis that a high level of glycan coverage is essential for maintaining infectivity of the virion (55Ohgimoto S. Shioda T. Mori K. Nakayama E.E. Hu H. Nagai Y.

Virol. 1998; 72: 8365-8370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apart from glycosylation, another factor affecting the generation of an effective immune response against HIV-1 is that the bNAbs against HIV-1 show a very high level of affinity maturation (57Klein F.

This new technology, which in particular is designed to be suitable to big data, is used to construct an open consolidated database from raw data on 4 million patents taken from the US patent office from 1976 onward. To build the pattern network, not only do we look at each patent title, but we also examine their full abstract and extract the relevant keywords accordingly. We refer to this classification as semantic approach in contrast with the more common technological approach which consists in taking the topology when considering US Patent office technological classes. Moreover, we document that both approaches have highly different topological measures and strong statistical evidence that they feature a different model. This suggests that our method is a useful tool to extract endogenous information."
https://openalex.org/W2608259352,"Objective The association between restless legs syndrome (RLS), cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and hypertension is inconsistent. This case-control study examined i) the association between primary RLS, CVD and hypertension by taking into account many potential confounders and ii) the influence of RLS duration, severity and treatment, sleep and depressive symptoms on CVD and hypertension in primary RLS. Methods A standardized questionnaire to assess the RLS phenotype, history of CVD and hypertension, sleep and depressive symptoms, drug intake and demographic/clinical features was sent to the France-Ekbom Patients Association members. A CVD event was defined as a self-reported history of coronary heart disease, heart failure, arrhythmia or stroke. Hypertension was also self-assessed. Current treatment for hypertension and arrhythmia also defined underlying hypertension and arrhythmia. Controls without RLS and without consanguinity were chosen by the patients. Results 487 patients with primary RLS (median age 71 years; 67.4% women) and 354 controls (68 years, 47.7% women) were included. Most of the patients (91.7%) were treated for RLS, especially with dopaminergic agonists. The median age of RLS onset was 45 years. CVD and hypertension were associated with RLS in unadjusted association, but not after adjustment for age, sex and body mass index. Patients with RLS and with CVD and/or hypertension were significantly older, with hypercholesterolemia, sleep apnea and older age at RLS and at daily RLS onset compared with patients without CVD and/or hypertension. No significant difference was found for other RLS features, ferritin levels, daytime sleepiness, insomnia and depressive symptoms. Conclusion Despite some limitations in the design of this study, we found that most of the treated patients for primary RLS had no association with CVD and hypertension after controlling for key potential confounders. Comorbid CVD or hypertension was associated with cardiovascular risk factors, but not with RLS features except for older age at onset."
https://openalex.org/W2607778805,"Greatwall (Gwl) kinase plays an essential role in the regulation of mitotic entry and progression. Mitotic activation of Gwl requires both cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1)-dependent phosphorylation and its autophosphorylation at an evolutionarily conserved serine residue near the carboxyl terminus (Ser-883 in Xenopus). In this study we show that Gwl associates with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), particularly PP1γ, which mediates the dephosphorylation of Gwl Ser-883. Consistent with the mitotic activation of Gwl, its association with PP1 is disrupted in mitotic cells and egg extracts. During mitotic exit, PP1-dependent dephosphorylation of Gwl Ser-883 occurs prior to dephosphorylation of other mitotic substrates; replacing endogenous Gwl with a phosphomimetic S883E mutant blocks mitotic exit. Moreover, we identified PP1 regulatory subunit 3B (PPP1R3B) as a targeting subunit that can direct PP1 activity toward Gwl. PPP1R3B bridges PP1 and Gwl association and promotes Gwl Ser-883 dephosphorylation. Consistent with the cell cycle-dependent association of Gwl and PP1, Gwl and PPP1R3B dissociate in M phase. Interestingly, up-regulation of PPP1R3B facilitates mitotic exit and blocks mitotic entry. Thus, our study suggests PPP1R3B as a new cell cycle regulator that functions by governing Gwl dephosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2608622537,"Virtual reality has great potential in training road safety skills to individuals with low vision but the feasibility of such training has not been demonstrated. We tested the hypotheses that low vision individuals could learn useful skills in virtual streets and could apply them to improve real street safety. Twelve participants, whose vision was too poor to use the pedestrian signals were taught by a certified orientation and mobility specialist to determine the safest time to cross the street using the visual and auditory signals made by the start of previously stopped cars at a traffic-light controlled street intersection. Four participants were trained in real streets and eight in virtual streets presented on 3 projection screens. The crossing timing of all participants was evaluated in real streets before and after training. The participants were instructed to say “GO” at the time when they felt the safest to cross the street. A safety score was derived to quantify the GO calls based on its occurrence in the pedestrian phase (when the pedestrian sign did not show DON’T WALK). Before training, > 50% of the GO calls from all participants fell in the DON’T WALK phase of the traffic cycle and thus were totally unsafe. 20% of the GO calls fell in the latter half of the pedestrian phase. These calls were unsafe because one initiated crossing this late might not have sufficient time to walk across the street. After training, 90% of the GO calls fell in the early half of the pedestrian phase. These calls were safer because one initiated crossing in the pedestrian phase and had at least half of the pedestrian phase for walking across. Similar safety changes occurred in both virtual street and real street trained participants. An ANOVA showed a significant increase of the safety scores after training and there was no difference in this safety improvement between the virtual street and real street trained participants. This study demonstrated that virtual reality-based orientation and mobility training could be as efficient as real street training in improving street safety in individuals with severely impaired vision."
https://openalex.org/W2609008606,"Sleep Apnea Syndrome (SAS) is a common sleep-related breathing disorder, which affects about 4-7% males and 2-4% females all around the world. Different approaches have been adopted to diagnose SAS and measure its severity, including the gold standard Polysomnography (PSG) in sleep study field as well as several alternative techniques such as single-channel ECG, pulse oximeter and so on. However, many shortcomings still limit their generalization in home environment. In this study, we aim to propose an efficient approach to automatically assess the severity of sleep apnea syndrome based on the ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal, which is non-intrusive and suitable for in home environment.We develop an unobtrusive sleep monitoring system to capture the BCG signals, based on which we put forward a three-stage sleep apnea syndrome severity assessment framework, i.e., data preprocessing, sleep-related breathing events (SBEs) detection, and sleep apnea syndrome severity evaluation. First, in the data preprocessing stage, to overcome the limits of BCG signals (e.g., low precision and reliability), we utilize wavelet decomposition to obtain the outline information of heartbeats, and apply a RR correction algorithm to handle missing or spurious RR intervals. Afterwards, in the event detection stage, we propose an automatic sleep-related breathing event detection algorithm named Physio_ICSS based on the iterative cumulative sums of squares (i.e., the ICSS algorithm), which is originally used to detect structural breakpoints in a time series. In particular, to efficiently detect sleep-related breathing events in the obtained time series of RR intervals, the proposed algorithm not only explores the practical factors of sleep-related breathing events (e.g., the limit of lasting duration and possible occurrence sleep stages) but also overcomes the event segmentation issue (e.g., equal-length segmentation method might divide one sleep-related breathing event into different fragments and lead to incorrect results) of existing approaches. Finally, by fusing features extracted from multiple domains, we can identify sleep-related breathing events and assess the severity level of sleep apnea syndrome effectively.Experimental results on 136 individuals of different sleep apnea syndrome severities validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, with the accuracy of 94.12% (128/136)."

Therefore, an attempt has been made to find out the resistance by screening and studying the genetic diversity of eighty released rice varieties by National Rice Research Institute, Cuttack (NRVs) using molecular markers linked to twelve major blast resistance (R) genes viz Pib, Piz, Piz-t, Pik, Pik-p, Pikm Pik-h, Pita/Pita-2, Pi2, Pi9, Pi1 and Pi5. Out of which, nineteen varieties (23.75%) showed resistance, twenty one were moderately resistant (26.25%) while remaining forty varieties (50%) showed susceptible in uniform blast nursery. Rice varieties possessing blast resistance genes varied from four to twelve and the frequencies of the resistance genes ranged from 0 to 100%. The cluster analysis grouped the eighty NRVs into two major clusters at 63% level of genetic similarity coefficient. The PIC value for seventeen markers varied from 0 to 0.37 at an average of 0.20. Out of seventeen markers, only five markers, 195R-1, Pi9-i, Pita3, YL155/YL87 and 40N23r corresponded to three broad spectrum R genes viz. Pi9, Pita/Pita2 and Pi5 were found to be significantly associated with the blast disease with explaining phenotypic variance from 3.5% to 7.7%. The population structure analysis and PCoA divided the entire 80 NRVs into two sub-groups. The outcome of this study would help to formulate strategies for improving rice blast resistance through genetic studies, plant-pathogen interaction, identification of novel R genes, development of new resistant varieties through marker-assisted breeding for improving rice blast resistance in India and worldwide."

https://openalex.org/W2609812423,"Objective β-Cell dysfunction plays a central role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D), and the identification of novel approaches to improve β-cell function is essential to treat this disease. Baicalein, a flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria Baicalensis, has been shown to have beneficial effects on β-cell function. Here, the authors investigated the molecular mechanism responsible for the protective effects of baicalein against palmitate (PA)-induced impaired β-cell function, and placed focus on the role of heme oxygenase (HO)-1. Methods Rat pancreatic β-cell line INS-1 cells or mouse pancreatic islets were cultured with PA (500 μM) to induce lipotoxicity in the presence or absence of baicalein (50 μM), and the expressions of the ER stress markers, ATF-3, CHOP and GRP78 were detected by Western blotting and/or qPCR. The involvement of HO-1 was evaluated by HO-1 siRNA transfection and using the HO-1 inhibitor ZnPP. Results Baicalein reduced PA-induced ER stress and inflammation and enhanced insulin secretion, and these effects were associated with the induction of HO-1. Furthermore, these protective effects were attenuated by ZnPP and by HO-1 siRNA. Pretreatment of PD98059 (an ERK inhibitor) significantly inhibited the protective effects of baicalein and blocked HO-1 induction. On the other hand, CO production by RuCO (a CO donor) ameliorated PA-induced ER stress, suggesting that CO production followed by HO-1 induction may contribute to the protective effects of baicalein against PA-induced β-cell dysfunction. Conclusion Baicalein protects pancreatic β-cells from PA-induced ER stress and inflammation via an ERK-HO-1 dependent pathway. The authors suggest HO-1 induction in pancreatic β-cells appears to be a promising therapeutic strategy for T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2609689957,"Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis is a Gram-positive, pleomorphic, facultative intracellular pathogen that causes Oedematous Skin Disease (OSD) in buffalo. To better understand the pathogenic mechanisms of OSD, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of 11 strains of C. pseudotuberculosis isolated from different buffalo found to be infected in Egypt during an outbreak that occurred in 2008. Sixteen previously described pathogenicity islands (PiCp) were present in all of the new buffalo strains, but one of them, PiCp12, had an insertion that contained both a corynephage and a diphtheria toxin gene, both of which may play a role in the adaptation of C. pseudotuberculosis to this new host. Synteny analysis showed variations in the site of insertion of the corynephage during the same outbreak. A gene functional comparison showed the presence of a nitrate reductase operon that included genes involved in molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis, which is necessary for a positive nitrate reductase phenotype and is a possible adaptation for intracellular survival. Genomes from the buffalo strains also had fusions in minor pilin genes in the spaA and spaD gene cluster (spaCX and spaYEF), which could suggest either an adaptation to this particular host, or mutation events in the immediate ancestor before this particular epidemic. A phylogenomic analysis confirmed a clear separation between the Ovis and Equi biovars, but also showed what appears to be a clustering by host species within the Equi strains."
https://openalex.org/W2608959282,"Low nephron endowment at birth has been associated with an increased risk for developing hypertension and chronic kidney disease. We demonstrated in an earlier study that conditional deletion of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme Dicer from nephron progenitors results in premature depletion of the progenitors and increased expression of the proapoptotic protein Bim (also known as Bcl-2L11). In this study, we generated a compound mouse model with conditional deletion of both Dicer and Bim, to determine the biologic significance of increased Bim expression in Dicer-deficient nephron progenitors. The loss of Bim partially restored the number of nephron progenitors and improved nephron formation. The number of progenitors undergoing apoptosis was significantly reduced in kidneys with loss of a single allele, or both alleles, of Bim compared to mutant kidneys. Furthermore, 2 miRNAs expressed in nephron progenitors (miR-17 and miR-106b) regulated Bim levels in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data suggest that miRNA-mediated regulation of Bim controls nephron progenitor survival during nephrogenesis, as one potential means of regulating nephron endowment.—Cerqueira, D.

https://openalex.org/W2607592227,"Background Young women in Malawi face many challenges in accessing family planning (FP), including distance to the health facility and partner disapproval. Our primary objective was to assess if training HSAs in couples counseling would increase modern FP uptake among young women. Methods In this cluster randomized controlled trial, 30 HSAs from Lilongwe, Malawi received training in FP. The HSAs were then randomized 1:1 to receive or not receive additional training in couples counseling. All HSAs were asked to provide FP counseling to women in their communities and record their contraceptive uptake over 6 months. Sexually-active women <30 years of age who had never used a modern FP method were included in this analysis. Generalized estimating equations with an exchangeable correlation matrix to account for clustering by HSA were used to estimate risk differences (RDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results 430 (53%) young women were counseled by the 15 HSAs who received couples counseling training, and 378 (47%) were counseled by the 15 HSAs who did not. 115 (26%) from the couples counseling group had male partners present during their first visit, compared to only 6 (2%) from the other group (RD: 0.21, 95% CI: 0.09 to 0.33, p<0.01). Nearly all (99.5%) initiated a modern FP method, with no difference between groups (p = 0.09). Women in the couples counseling group were 8% more likely to receive male condoms (RD: 0.08, 95% CI: -7% to 23%, p = 0.28) and 8% more likely to receive dual methods (RD: 0.08, 95% CI: -0.065, 0.232, p = 0.274). Conclusion Training HSAs in FP led to high modern FP uptake among young women who had never used FP. Couples counseling training increased male involvement with a trend towards higher male condom uptake."

It is supposed to interact with the matrix producing myofibroblasts and compensate the declining regenerative capacity of hepatocytes. The relationship between the extent of fibrosis-ductular reaction, proliferative activity of hepatocytes and ductular reaction were studied sequentially in experimental hepatic fibrosis models.Liver fibrosis/cirrhosis was induced in wild type and TGFβ overproducing transgenic mice by carbon tetrachloride and thioacetamide administration. The effect of thioacetamide was modulated by treatment with imatinib and erlotinib. The extent of ductular reaction and fibrosis was measured by morphometry following cytokeratin 19 immunofluorescent labeling and Picro Sirius staining respectively. The proliferative activity of hepatocytes and ductular reaction was evaluated by BrdU incorporation. The temporal distribution of the parameters was followed and compared within and between different experimental groups.There was a strong significant correlation between the extent of fibrosis and ductular reaction in each experimental group. Although imatinib and erlotinib temporarily decreased fibrosis this effect later disappeared. We could not observe negative correlation between the proliferation of hepatocytes and ductular reaction in any of the investigated models.The stringent connection between ductular reaction and fibrosis, which cannot be influenced by any of our treatment regimens, suggests that there is a close mutual interaction between them instead of a unidirectional causal relationship. Our results confirm a close connection between DR and fibrogenesis. However, since the two parameters changed together we could not establish a causal relationship and were unable to reveal which was the primary event. The lack of inverse correlation between the proliferation of hepatocytes and ductular reaction questions that ductular reaction can compensate for the failing regenerative activity of hepatocytes. No evidences support the persistent antifibrotic property of imatinib or erlotinib."

We study the full sample period, as well as three subsamples to determine how high-frequency data of precious metals have developed over time. We find that over the full sample, the number of trades has increased substantially over time for each precious metal, while the bid-ask spread has narrowed over time, indicating an increase in liquidity and price efficiency. We also find strong evidence of periodicity in returns, volatility, volume and bid-ask spread. Returns and volume both experience strong intraday periodicity linked to the opening and closing of major markets around the world while the bid-ask spread is at its lowest when European markets are open. We also show a bilateral Granger causality between returns and volatility of each precious metal, which holds for the vast majority subsamples."
https://openalex.org/W2609639242,"Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are promising drug targets to manage several neurological disorders and nicotine addiction. Growing evidence indicates that positive allosteric modulators of nAChRs improve pharmacological specificity by binding to unique sites present only in a subpopulation of nAChRs. Furthermore, nAChR positive allosteric modulators such as NS9283 and CMPI have been shown to potentiate responses of (α4)3(β2)2 but not (α4)2(β2)3 nAChR isoforms. This selective potentiation underlines that the α4:α4 interface, which is present only in the (α4)3(β2)2 nAChR, is an important and promising drug target. In this report we used site-directed mutagenesis to substitute specific amino acid residues and computational analyses to elucidate CMPI's binding mode at the α4:α4 subunit extracellular interface and identified a unique set of amino acid residues that determined its affinity. We found that amino acid residues α4Gly-41, α4Lys-64, and α4Thr-66 were critical for (α4)3(β2)2 nAChR potentiation by CMPI, but not by NS9283, whereas amino acid substitution at α4His-116, a known determinant of NS9283 and of agonist binding at the α4:α4 subunit interface, did not reduce CMPI potentiation. In contrast, substitutions at α4Gln-124 and α4Thr-126 reduced potentiation by CMPI and NS9283, indicating that their binding sites partially overlap. These results delineate the role of amino acid residues contributing to the α4:α4 subunit extracellular interface in nAChR potentiation. These findings also provide structural information that will facilitate the structure-based design of novel therapeutics that target selectively the (α4)3(β2)2 nAChR."
https://openalex.org/W2609729536,"The transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) is up-regulated in several clinical disorders, including dehydration. NFAT5-sensitive genes include serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1). The kinase is a powerful regulator of Orai1, a Ca2+ channel accomplishing store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Orai1 is stimulated after intracellular store depletion by the Ca2+ sensors stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1), or STIM2, or both. In the present study, we explored whether nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT)-5 influences Ca2+ signaling in megakaryocytes. To this end, human megakaryocytic (MEG-01) cells were transfected with NFAT5 or with siNFAT5. Platelets and megakaryocytes were isolated from wild-type mice with either access to water ad libitum or dehydration by 36 h of water deprivation. Transcript levels were determined with quantitative RT-PCR and protein abundance by Western blot analysis and flow cytometry, cytosolic (intracellular) Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) by fura-2-fluorescence. SOCE was estimated from the increase of [Ca2+]i following readdition of extracellular Ca2+ after store depletion with thapsigargin (1 µM). Platelet degranulation was estimated from P-selectin abundance and integrin activation from αIIbβ3 integrin abundance determined by flow cytometry. As a result, NFAT5 transfection or exposure to hypertonicity (+40 mM NaCl) of MEG-01 cells increased Orai1, Orai2, STIM1, and STIM2 transcript levels. Orai1 transcript levels were decreased by NFAT5 silencing. NFAT5 transfection and IκB inhibitor BMS 345541 (5 µM) increased SOCE, whereas NFAT5 silencing and SGK1 inhibitor GSK650394 (10 µM) decreased SOCE. In the mice, dehydration increased NFAT5 and Orai1 protein abundance in megakaryocytes and NFAT5, Orai1, and Orai2 abundance in platelets. Dehydration further augmented the degranulation and integrin activation by thrombin and collagen-related peptide. In summary, NFAT5 is a powerful regulator of Orai1-expression and SOCE in megakaryocytes.-Sahu, I., Pelzl, L., Sukkar, B., Fakhri, H., al-Maghout, T., Cao, H., Hauser, S., Gutti, R., Gawaz, M., Lang, F.

https://openalex.org/W2608887548,"Pattern classification techniques have been widely used to differentiate neural activity associated with different perceptual, attentional, or other cognitive states, often using fMRI, but more recently with EEG as well. Although these methods have identified EEG patterns (i.e., scalp topographies of EEG signals occurring at certain latencies) that decode perceptual and attentional states on a trial-by-trial basis, they have yet to be applied to the spatial scope of attention toward global or local features of the display. Here, we initially used pattern classification to replicate and extend the findings that perceptual states could be reliably decoded from EEG. We found that visual perceptual states, including stimulus location and object category, could be decoded with high accuracy peaking between 125–250 ms, and that the discriminative spatiotemporal patterns mirrored and extended our (and other well-established) ERP results. Next, we used pattern classification to investigate whether spatiotemporal EEG signals could reliably predict attentional states, and particularly, the scope of attention. The EEG data were reliably differentiated for local versus global attention on a trial-by-trial basis, emerging as a specific spatiotemporal activation pattern over posterior electrode sites during the 250–750 ms interval after stimulus onset. In sum, we demonstrate that multivariate pattern analysis of EEG, which reveals unique spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity distinguishing between behavioral states, is a sensitive tool for characterizing the neural correlates of perception and attention."
https://openalex.org/W2608642824,"Animals living in the intertidal zone are exposed to prominent temperature changes. To cope with the energetic demands of environmental thermal challenges, ectotherms rely mainly on behavioral responses, which may change depending on the time of the day and seasonally. Here, we analyze how temperature shapes crabs' behavior at 2 different times of the year and show that a transition from constant cold (13.5°C) to constant warm (17.5°C) water temperature leads to increased locomotor activity levels throughout the day in fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator) collected during the summer. In contrast, the same transition in environmental temperature leads to a decrease in the amplitude of the daily locomotor activity rhythm in crabs collected during the winter. In other words, colder temperatures during the cold season favor a more prominent diurnal behavior. We interpret this winter-summer difference in the response of daily locomotor activity to temperature changes within the framework of the circadian thermoenergetics hypothesis, which predicts that a less favorable energetic balance would promote a more diurnal activity pattern. During the winter, when the energetic balance is likely less favorable, crabs would save energy by being more active during the expected high-temperature phase of the day-light phase-and less during the expected low-temperature phase of the day-dark phase. Our results suggest that endogenous rhythms in intertidal ectotherms generate adaptive behavioral programs to cope with thermoregulatory demands of the intertidal habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2609190975,"Canine oral mucosal melanoma is an aggressive malignant neoplasm and is characterized by local infiltration and a high metastatic potential. The disease progression is similar to that of human oral melanomas. Whereas human cutaneous melanoma is primarily driven by activating mutations in Braf (60%) or Nras (20%), human mucosal melanoma harbors these mutations much less frequently. This makes therapeutic targeting and research modeling of the oral form potentially different from that of the cutaneous form in humans. Similarly, research has found only rare Nras mutations and no activating Braf mutations in canine oral melanomas, but they are still reliant on MAPK signaling. IQGAP1 is a signaling scaffold that regulates oncogenic ERK1/2 MAPK signaling in human Ras- and Raf- driven cancers, including melanomas. To investigate whether IQGAP1 is a potential target in canine melanoma, we examined the expression and localization of IQGAP1 in primary canine melanomas and canine oral melanoma cell lines obtained from the University of California-Davis. Using CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of IQGAP1, we examined effects on downstream ERK1/2 pathway activity and assayed proliferation of cell lines when treated with a peptide that blocks the interaction between IQGAP1 and ERK1/2. We observed that canine IQGAP1 is expressed and localizes to a similar extent in both human and canine melanoma by qPCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Deletion of IQGAP1 reduces MAPK pathway activation in cell lines, similar to effects seen in human BrafV600E cell lines. Additionally, we demonstrated reduced proliferation when these cells are treated with a blocking peptide in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2608966559,"TGF-β is a cytokine thought to function as a tumor promoter in advanced malignancies. In this setting, TGF-β increases cancer cell proliferation, survival, and migration, and orchestrates complex, pro-tumorigenic changes in the tumor microenvironment. Here, we find that in melanoma, integrin β1-mediated TGF-β activation may also produce tumor suppression via an altered host response. In the A375 human melanoma cell nu/nu xenograft model, we demonstrate that cell surface integrin β1-activation increases TGF-β activity, resulting in stromal activation, neo-angiogenesis and, unexpectedly for this nude mouse model, increase in the number of intra-tumoral CD8+ T lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment. This is associated with attenuation of tumor growth and long-term survival benefit. Correspondingly, in human melanomas, TGF-β1 correlates with integrin β1/TGF-β1 activation and the expression of markers for vasculature and stromal activation. Surprisingly, this integrin β1/TGF-β1 transcriptional footprint also correlates with the expression of markers for tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, multiple immune checkpoints and regulatory pathways, and, importantly, better long-term survival of patients. These correlations are unique to melanoma, in that we do not observe similar associations between β1 integrin/TGF-β1 activation and better long-term survival in other human tumor types. These results suggest that activation of TGF-β1 in melanoma may be associated with the generation of an anti-tumor host response that warrants further study."

AntagomiR-451, the miroRNA-451 (""miR-451"") inhibitor, could activate pro-survival AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling. In the current study, we showed that forced-expression of antagomiR-451 depleted miRNA-451 and significantly attenuated OGD-induced necrosis of HUVECs. Activation of AMPK was required for antagomiR-451-mediated pro-survival actions. AMPK inhibition, by AMPKα shRNA or dominant negative mutation, almost completely abolishedantagomiR-451-mediated HUVEC protection again OGD. Reversely, forced-activation of AMPK by exogenous expression of constructively-active AMPKα inhibited OGD-induced HUVEC necrosis. At the molecular level, antagomiR-451 expression in HUVECs inhibited OGD-induced programmed necrosis, the latter was evidenced by mitochondrial p53-cyclophilinD (Cyp-D) association, mitochondrial depolarization as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) breach. Together, we suggest that antagomiR-451 activates AMPK to inhibit OGD-induced programmed necrosis in HUVECs."
https://openalex.org/W2609497793,"Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila) is a causative agent of severe pneumonia. It is highly adapted to intracellular replication and manipulates host cell functions like vesicle trafficking and mRNA translation to its own advantage. However, it is still unknown to what extent microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the Legionella-host cell interaction.WT and MyD88-/- murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were infected with L. pneumophila, the transcriptome was analyzed by high throughput qPCR array (microRNAs) and conventional qPCR (mRNAs), and mRNA-miRNA interaction was validated by luciferase assays with 3´-UTR mutations and western blot.L. pneumophila infection caused a pro-inflammatory reaction and significant miRNA changes in murine macrophages. In MyD88-/- cells, induction of inflammatory markers, such as Ccxl1/Kc, Il6 and miR-146a-5p was reduced. Induction of miR-125a-3p was completely abrogated in MyD88-/- cells. Target prediction analyses revealed N-terminal asparagine amidase 1 (NTAN1), a factor from the n-end rule pathway, to be a putative target of miR-125a-3p. This interaction could be confirmed by luciferase assay and western blot.Taken together, we characterized the miRNA regulation in L. pneumophila infection with regard to MyD88 signaling and identified NTAN1 as a target of miR-125a-3p. This finding unravels a yet unknown feature of Legionella-host cell interaction, potentially relevant for new treatment options."

https://openalex.org/W2609541914,"The optomotor response of animals is commonly used to measure their visual performance, e.g., rats of different genetically altered strains or various drug tests. With the presentation of stimuli using computer screens or projectors, the common idea focuses on measuring the eye movement or head and/or body movement to characterize changes of the head gaze. However, traditional methods rely on either the invasive fixation of animals, or the judgment of a human observer who reports the stimulus-tracking movements. In this paper, we propose a novel head gaze determination system to automatically track the head movement of rats without artificial markers. The experiments were done to demonstrate the process of optimizing parameters in image processing. As a result, the head angle curve of the proposed method is consistent with that of ground-truth data annotated manually according to predefined rules. Hence, the proposed method provides a simple, convenient, and objective solution to automatically generate the head gaze orientations from massive amounts of recorded data for further visual performance analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2608004775,"Booreana mice carrying the c-Myb308G point mutation were analyzed to determine changes in early hematopoiesis in the bone marrow and among mature cells in the periphery. This point mutation led to increased numbers of early hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), with a subsequent reduction in the development of B cells, erythroid cells, and neutrophils, and increased numbers of myeloid cells and granulocytes. Myelopoiesis was further investigated by way of particular subsets affected. A specific question addressed whether booreana mice contained increased numbers of dendritic-like cells (L-DC subset) recently identified in the spleen, since L-DCs arise in vitro by direct differentiation from HSPCs co-cultured over splenic stroma. The non-lethal c-Myb mutation in booreana mice was associated with significantly lower representation of splenic CD8- conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), inflammatory monocytes, and neutrophils compared to wild-type mice. This result confirmed the bone marrow origin of progenitors for these subsets since c-Myb is essential for their development. Production of L-DCs and resident monocytes was not affected by the c-MybE308G mutation. These subsets may derive from different progenitors than those in bone marrow, and are potentially established in the spleen during embryogenesis. An alternative explanation may be needed for why there was no change in CD8+ cDCs in booreana spleen since these cells are known to derive from common dendritic progenitors in bone marrow."
https://openalex.org/W2608455819,"A collection of 28 hipparionine skull and mandible fossils with a dated age of approximately 7.4 Ma from Fugu, Shaanxi, northwestern China (belonging to Hipparion chiai and Hipparion cf. coelophyes) shows an age distribution in a successive development sequence. By observing the dentitions in these fossil materials, knowledge of dental ontogeny has been gained, such as the opening time of the posterior wall of post-fossettes, the displacement of the plis hypostyle, the morphologic changes of the protocone and hypocone, etc. Additionally, 4 isolated maxillary cheek teeth and 2 mandibular cheek teeth were cut into slices in the traditional manner for authentication. These discoveries indicate that both of the hipparionine species in the Lamagou fauna are Hipparion cf. chiai exactly and offer further insight into the morphologic changes that occur during dental wear in hipparionines, which may greatly promote the morphological and taxonomic study of hipparionine species."
https://openalex.org/W2609121928,A feature of the cell cycle is that the events of one cycle must be reset before the next one begins. A study now shows that the replication machinery is removed from fully replicated DNA by a conserved ubiquitin- and CDC48 (also known as p97)-dependent pathway. This explains how eukaryotic chromosomes are returned to the unreplicated state.
https://openalex.org/W2509656752,"The massive employment of computational models in network epidemiology calls for the development of improved inference methods for epidemic forecast. For simple compartment models, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, Belief Propagation was proved to be a reliable and efficient method to identify the origin of an observed epidemics. Here we show that the same method can be applied to predict the future evolution of an epidemic outbreak from partial observations at the early stage of the dynamics. The results obtained using Belief Propagation are compared with Monte Carlo direct sampling in the case of SIR model on random (regular and power-law) graphs for different observation methods and on an example of real-world contact network. Belief Propagation gives in general a better prediction that direct sampling, although the quality of the prediction depends on the quantity under study (e.g. marginals of individual states, epidemic size, extinction-time distribution) and on the actual number of observed nodes that are infected before the observation time."
