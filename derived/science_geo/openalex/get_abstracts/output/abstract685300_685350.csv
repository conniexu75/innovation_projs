https://openalex.org/W4200371263,"Density functional theory describes matter at the quantum level, but all popular approximations suffer from systematic errors that arise from the violation of mathematical properties of the exact functional. We overcame this fundamental limitation by training a neural network on molecular data and on fictitious systems with fractional charge and spin. The resulting functional, DM21 (DeepMind 21), correctly describes typical examples of artificial charge delocalization and strong correlation and performs better than traditional functionals on thorough benchmarks for main-group atoms and molecules. DM21 accurately models complex systems such as hydrogen chains, charged DNA base pairs, and diradical transition states. More crucially for the field, because our methodology relies on data and constraints, which are continually improving, it represents a viable pathway toward the exact universal functional."

We analyze how 12 forest attributes recover during secondary succession and how their recovery is interrelated using 77 sites across the tropics. Tropical forests are highly resilient to low-intensity land use; after 20 years, forest attributes attain 78% (33 to 100%) of their old-growth values. Recovery to 90% of old-growth values is fastest for soil (<1 decade) and plant functioning (<2.5 decades), intermediate for structure and species diversity (2.5 to 6 decades), and slowest for biomass and species composition (>12 decades). Network analysis shows three independent clusters of attribute recovery, related to structure, species diversity, and species composition. Secondary forests should be embraced as a low-cost, natural solution for ecosystem restoration, climate change mitigation, and biodiversity conservation."
https://openalex.org/W4200434404,"Physical exercise is generally beneficial to all aspects of human and animal health, slowing cognitive ageing and neurodegeneration1. The cognitive benefits of physical exercise are tied to an increased plasticity and reduced inflammation within the hippocampus2-4, yet little is known about the factors and mechanisms that mediate these effects. Here we show that 'runner plasma', collected from voluntarily running mice and infused into sedentary mice, reduces baseline neuroinflammatory gene expression and experimentally induced brain inflammation. Plasma proteomic analysis revealed a concerted increase in complement cascade inhibitors including clusterin (CLU). Intravenously injected CLU binds to brain endothelial cells and reduces neuroinflammatory gene expression in a mouse model of acute brain inflammation and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Patients with cognitive impairment who participated in structured exercise for 6 months had higher plasma levels of CLU. These findings demonstrate the existence of anti-inflammatory exercise factors that are transferrable, target the cerebrovasculature and benefit the brain, and are present in humans who engage in exercise."
https://openalex.org/W4200003648,"Surveys are a crucial tool for understanding public opinion and behaviour, and their accuracy depends on maintaining statistical representativeness of their target populations by minimizing biases from all sources. Increasing data size shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the effect of survey bias: an instance of the Big Data Paradox1. Here we demonstrate this paradox in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults from 9 January to 19 May 2021 from two large surveys: Delphi-Facebook2,3 (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse4 (about 75,000 every two weeks). In May 2021, Delphi-Facebook overestimated uptake by 17 percentage points (14-20 percentage points with 5% benchmark imprecision) and Census Household Pulse by 14 (11-17 percentage points with 5% benchmark imprecision), compared to a retroactively updated benchmark the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published on 26 May 2021. Moreover, their large sample sizes led to miniscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates. By contrast, an Axios-Ipsos online panel5 with about 1,000 responses per week following survey research best practices6 provided reliable estimates and uncertainty quantification. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework1 to explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We then analyse the implications for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000 respondents can produce an estimate of the population mean that is no more accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10. Our central message is that data quality matters more than data quantity, and that compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing proposition."
https://openalex.org/W4200431799,"Collective cell migration underlies morphogenesis, wound healing and cancer invasion1,2. Most directed migration in vivo has been attributed to chemotaxis, whereby cells follow a chemical gradient3-5. Cells can also follow a stiffness gradient in vitro, a process called durotaxis3,4,6-8, but evidence for durotaxis in vivo is lacking6. Here we show that in Xenopus laevis the neural crest-an embryonic cell population-self-generates a stiffness gradient in the adjacent placodal tissue, and follows this gradient by durotaxis. The gradient moves with the neural crest, which is continually pursuing a retreating region of high substrate stiffness. Mechanistically, the neural crest induces the gradient due to N-cadherin interactions with the placodes and senses the gradient through cell-matrix adhesions, resulting in polarized Rac activity and actomyosin contractility, which coordinates durotaxis. Durotaxis synergizes with chemotaxis, cooperatively polarizing actomyosin machinery of the cell group to prompt efficient directional collective cell migration in vivo. These results show that durotaxis and dynamic stiffness gradients exist in vivo, and gradients of chemical and mechanical signals cooperate to achieve efficient directional cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W4200289210,"The σ2 receptor has attracted intense interest in cancer imaging1, psychiatric disease2, neuropathic pain3–5 and other areas of biology6,7. Here we determined the crystal structure of this receptor in complex with the clinical candidate roluperidone2 and the tool compound PB288. These structures templated a large-scale docking screen of 490 million virtual molecules, of which 484 compounds were synthesized and tested. We identified 127 new chemotypes with affinities superior to 1 μM, 31 of which had affinities superior to 50 nM. The hit rate fell smoothly and monotonically with docking score. We optimized three hits for potency and selectivity, and achieved affinities that ranged from 3 to 48 nM, with up to 250-fold selectivity versus the σ1 receptor. Crystal structures of two ligands bound to the σ2 receptor confirmed the docked poses. To investigate the contribution of the σ2 receptor in pain, two potent σ2-selective ligands and one potent σ1/σ2 non-selective ligand were tested for efficacy in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. All three ligands showed time-dependent decreases in mechanical hypersensitivity in the spared nerve injury model9, suggesting that the σ2 receptor has a role in nociception. This study illustrates the opportunities for rapid discovery of in vivo probes through structure-based screens of ultra large libraries, enabling study of underexplored areas of biology. Crystal structures of the σ2 receptor are determined and used to perform a docking screen of nearly 500 million molecules, identifying σ2-selective ligands and providing insight into the role of σ2 in neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W4200417834,"The hydrophobic–water interface plays a key role in biological interactions. However, both the hydrophobic–water interfacial molecular structure and the origin of the negative zeta potential of hydrophobic droplets in water are heavily contested. We report polarimetric vibrational sum-frequency scattering of the O–D and C-H stretch modes of 200-nanometer hexadecane oil droplets dispersed in water. An unusually broad spectral distribution (2550 to 2750 per centimeter) of interfacial water molecules that were not hydrogen bonded to other water molecules was observed, as well as a blue shift in the vibrational frequency of the interfacial hexadecane C-H stretch modes. Oil and water frequency shifts correlated with the negative electrostatic charge. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated that the unexpected strong charge-transfer interactions arose from interfacial C–H∙∙∙O hydrogen bonds."
https://openalex.org/W4200399359,"Nonvolatile phase-change memory has been successfully commercialized, but further density scaling below 10 nanometers requires compositionally and structurally homogeneous materials for both the memory cell and the associated vertically stacked two-terminal access switch. The selector switches are mostly amorphous-chalcogenide Ovonic threshold switches (OTSs), operating with a nonlinear current response above a threshold voltage in the amorphous state. However, they currently suffer from the chemical complexity introduced by the quaternary or even more diverse chalcogenide compositions used. We present a single-element tellurium (Te) volatile switch with a large (≥11 megaamperes per square centimeter) drive current density, ~103 ON/OFF current ratio, and faster than 20 nanosecond switching speed. The low OFF current arises from the existence of a ~0.95–electron volt Schottky barrier at the Te–electrode interface, whereas a transient, voltage pulse–induced crystal-liquid melting transition of the pure Te leads to a high ON current. Our discovery of a single-element electrical switch may help realize denser memory chips."

https://openalex.org/W4200604215,"Policy-makers are increasingly turning to behavioural science for insights about how to improve citizens' decisions and outcomes1. Typically, different scientists test different intervention ideas in different samples using different outcomes over different time intervals2. The lack of comparability of such individual investigations limits their potential to inform policy. Here, to address this limitation and accelerate the pace of discovery, we introduce the megastudy-a massive field experiment in which the effects of many different interventions are compared in the same population on the same objectively measured outcome for the same duration. In a megastudy targeting physical exercise among 61,293 members of an American fitness chain, 30 scientists from 15 different US universities worked in small independent teams to design a total of 54 different four-week digital programmes (or interventions) encouraging exercise. We show that 45% of these interventions significantly increased weekly gym visits by 9% to 27%; the top-performing intervention offered microrewards for returning to the gym after a missed workout. Only 8% of interventions induced behaviour change that was significant and measurable after the four-week intervention. Conditioning on the 45% of interventions that increased exercise during the intervention, we detected carry-over effects that were proportionally similar to those measured in previous research3-6. Forecasts by impartial judges failed to predict which interventions would be most effective, underscoring the value of testing many ideas at once and, therefore, the potential for megastudies to improve the evidentiary value of behavioural science."

Depth is recovered by measuring the round-trip flight time of laser pulses, typically using collection optics of several centimeters in diameter. We demonstrate near–video-rate 3D imaging through multimode fibers with a total aperture of several hundred micrometers. We implement aberration correction using wavefront shaping synchronized with a pulsed source and scan the scene at ~23,000 points per second. We image moving objects several meters beyond the end of an ~40-centimeters-long fiber of 50-micrometer core diameter at frame rates of ~5 hertz. Our work grants far-field depth-resolving capabilities to ultrathin microendoscopes, which we expect to have applications to clinical and remote inspection scenarios."

https://openalex.org/W4200379539,"Glucose is a primary energy source in living cells. The discovery in 1960s that a sodium gradient powers the active uptake of glucose in the intestine1 heralded the concept of a secondary active transporter that can catalyse the movement of a substrate against an electrochemical gradient by harnessing energy from another coupled substrate. Subsequently, coupled Na+/glucose transport was found to be mediated by sodium-glucose cotransporters2,3 (SGLTs). SGLTs are responsible for active glucose and galactose absorption in the intestine and for glucose reabsorption in the kidney4, and are targeted by multiple drugs to treat diabetes5. Several members within the SGLT family transport key metabolites other than glucose2. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the prototypic human SGLT1 and a related monocarboxylate transporter SMCT1 from the same family. The structures, together with molecular dynamics simulations and functional studies, define the architecture of SGLTs, uncover the mechanism of substrate binding and selectivity, and shed light on water permeability of SGLT1. These results provide insights into the multifaceted functions of SGLTs."
https://openalex.org/W4200390305,"ESCRTing lenses away from senescence ESCRT proteins control membrane fusion in various key cellular processes, but the mechanisms involved are still incompletely understood. Gulluni et al . report that ESCRT recruitment at the cytokinetic bridge is mediated by the binding of an ESCRT-II subunit to the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (see the Perspective by Brill and Wilde). This pathway acts in parallel to a known cascade driven by a protein called ALIX, but its failure is sufficient to lead to premature senescence in the lens of fish, mouse, and human eyes, where ALIX is expressed at lower levels. These results point to an evolutionarily conserved pathway for the cell-specific control of cytokinesis that serves to protect from senescence and the early onset of cataracts. —SMH"

https://openalex.org/W4200300845,"The liberation of energy stores from adipocytes is critical to support survival in times of energy deficit; however, uncontrolled or chronic lipolysis associated with insulin resistance and/or insulin insufficiency disrupts metabolic homeostasis1,2. Coupled to lipolysis is the release of a recently identified hormone, fatty-acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4)3. Although circulating FABP4 levels have been strongly associated with cardiometabolic diseases in both preclinical models and humans4–7, no mechanism of action has yet been described8–10. Here we show that hormonal FABP4 forms a functional hormone complex with adenosine kinase (ADK) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK) to regulate extracellular ATP and ADP levels. We identify a substantial effect of this hormone on beta cells and given the central role of beta-cell function in both the control of lipolysis and development of diabetes, postulate that hormonal FABP4 is a key regulator of an adipose–beta-cell endocrine axis. Antibody-mediated targeting of this hormone complex improves metabolic outcomes, enhances beta-cell function and preserves beta-cell integrity to prevent both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Thus, the FABP4–ADK–NDPK complex, Fabkin, represents a previously unknown hormone and mechanism of action that integrates energy status with the function of metabolic organs, and represents a promising target against metabolic disease. Hormonal FABP4 is discovered to be a pivotal regulator of an adipose–beta-cell endocrine axis that coordinates energy status and metabolic organ function, and targeting this axis improved metabolic outcomes."

https://openalex.org/W4200096216,"Stability of the epigenetic landscape underpins maintenance of the cell-type-specific transcriptional profile. As one of the main repressive epigenetic systems, DNA methylation has been shown to be important for long-term gene silencing; its loss leads to ectopic and aberrant transcription in differentiated cells and cancer1. The developing mouse germ line endures global changes in DNA methylation in the absence of widespread transcriptional activation. Here, using an ultra-low-input native chromatin immunoprecipitation approach, we show that following DNA demethylation the gonadal primordial germ cells undergo remodelling of repressive histone modifications, resulting in a sex-specific signature in mice. We further demonstrate that Polycomb has a central role in transcriptional control in the newly hypomethylated germline genome as the genetic loss of Ezh2 leads to aberrant transcriptional activation, retrotransposon derepression and dramatic loss of developing female germ cells. This sex-specific effect of Ezh2 deletion is explained by the distinct landscape of repressive modifications observed in male and female germ cells. Overall, our study provides insight into the dynamic interplay between repressive chromatin modifications in the context of a developmental reprogramming system."
https://openalex.org/W4200484681,"COVID-19 leads small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to survive very hard. The development difficulties of SMEs lead to weak employment and GDP growth in various countries. In the process of COVID-19’s continuous spread, what is the major reason for the difficulties of SMEs? This paper hopes to answer this question by studying SMEs in Beijing. On this basis, this paper uses structural equation model (SEM) to study the relatively fast recovery of SMEs in Beijing, China, to explore the factors affecting SMEs in the pandemic. After detailed desk research and interviews with relevant entrepreneurs, this paper collects 234 valid questionnaires from SMEs in various industries in Beijing with the help of Federation of Industry and Commerce and Chamber of Commerce in Beijing. Then the data is analyzed with the SEM, which shows the relationship between cash flow from financing activities, markets, employees, costs, government policies and the impact of the pandemic. Finally, an impact model of the pandemic on SMEs is established. The result of the model indicates that the direct effect of the pandemic on the market is the most prominent, and government policies can significantly reduce the negative impact of the pandemic on SMEs indirectly. Based on this, this paper puts forward some policy suggestions, such as the targeted issuance of consumption vouchers and the reduction of administrative barriers. This will enable megacities in various countries to improve policy support for SMEs and promote the recovery and development of SMEs."
https://openalex.org/W4200075986,"The sheathing leaf found in grasses and other monocots is an evolutionary innovation, yet its origin has been a subject of long-standing debate. Here, we revisit the problem in the light of developmental genetics and computational modeling. We show that the sheathing leaf likely arose through WOX-gene-dependent extension of a primordial zone straddling concentric domains around the shoot apex. Patterned growth within this zone, oriented by two polarity fields, accounts for wild-type, mutant and mosaic grass leaf development, whereas zone contraction and growth remodeling accounts for eudicot leaf development. In contrast to the prevailing view, our results suggest that the sheath derives from petiole, whereas the blade derives from the lamina of the eudicot leaf, consistent with homologies proposed in the 19th century."
https://openalex.org/W4200233214,"Associative memories guide behavioural adaptation by binding together outcome-predictive sensory stimuli1,2. However, in a feature-rich environment, only a subset of stimuli may predict a desired outcome3,4. How neural circuits enable behavioural adaptation by selectively and durably representing subsets of sensory stimuli that are pertinent to a specific outcome is not known. We investigated this feature selection process in the hippocampus during memory acquisition and subsequent consolidation. Two-photon calcium imaging of CA3 axonal projections to CA1 combined with simultaneous local field potential recordings revealed that CA3 projections that encode behaviourally informative sensory stimuli were selectively recruited during the memory replay events that underlie hippocampal memory consolidation5. These axonal projections formed sequential assemblies that conjunctively link sensory features to spatial location and thus reward proximity. By contrast, axons encoding uninformative, peripatetic sensory cues were notably suppressed during memory replay. Thus, while the hippocampus comprehensively encodes the real-time sensory environment, it implements a flexible filtering mechanism to maximize the utility of memories destined for long-term storage. We propose that utility-dependent recruitment of sensory experience during memory consolidation is a general coding principle for associative learning. In memory consolidation, the hippocampus has a unique way to preferentially amplify behaviour-relevant information that entails ‘replaying’ this information during periods of rest."

However, the singular orbital magnetism of undoped graphene, a fundamental signature of the characteristic Berry phase of graphene’s electronic wave functions, has been challenging to measure in a single flake. Using a highly sensitive giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensor, we have measured the gate voltage–dependent magnetization of a single graphene monolayer encapsulated between boron nitride crystals. The signal exhibits a diamagnetic peak at the Dirac point whose magnetic field and temperature dependences agree with long-standing theoretical predictions. Our measurements offer a means to monitor Berry phase singularities and explore correlated states generated by the combined effects of Coulomb interactions, strain, or moiré potentials."
https://openalex.org/W4200195682,"A strategy frequently adopted to contain the COVID-19 pandemic involves three non-pharmaceutical interventions that depend on high levels of compliance in society: maintaining physical distance from others, minimizing social contacts, and wearing a face mask. These measures require substantial changes in established practices of social interaction, raising the question of which factors motivate individuals to comply with these preventive behaviours. Using Austrian panel survey data from April 2020 to April 2021, we show that perceived health risks, social norms, and trust in political institutions stimulate people to engage in preventive behaviour. A moderation analysis shows that the effectiveness of social norms in facilitating preventive behaviour increases when people’s perceptions of health risks decrease. No such moderation effect is observed for trust in political institutions. These results suggest that strong social norms play a crucial role in achieving high rates of preventive behaviour, especially when perceived levels of health risks are low."

Previously, risk factors such as age and ethnicity, were identified by studying COVID-related deaths only, but these were under-recorded during this period.To use a large electronic primary care database to estimate the impact of risk factors (RFs) on excess mortality in England during the first wave, compared with the impact on total mortality during 2015-19.Medical history, ethnicity, area-based deprivation and vital status data were extracted for an average of 4.8 million patients aged 30-104 years, for each year between 18-March and 19-May over a 6-year period (2015-2020). We used Poisson regression to model total mortality adjusting for age and sex, with interactions between each RF and period (pandemic vs. 2015-19). Total mortality during the pandemic was partitioned into ""usual"" and ""excess"" components, assuming 2015-19 rates represented ""usual"" mortality. The association of each RF with the 2020 ""excess"" component was derived as the excess mortality ratio (EMR), and compared with the usual mortality ratio (UMR).RFs where excess mortality was greatest and notably higher than usual were age >80, non-white ethnicity (e.g., black vs. white EMR = 2.50, 95%CI 1.97-3.18; compared to UMR = 0.92, 95%CI 0.85-1.00), BMI>40, dementia, learning disability, severe mental illness, place of residence (London, care-home, most deprived). By contrast, EMRs were comparable to UMRs for sex. Although some co-morbidities such as cancer produced EMRs significantly below their UMRs, the EMRs were still >1. In contrast current smoking has an EMR below 1 (EMR = 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.98) compared to its UMR = 1.64.Studying risk factors for excess mortality during the pandemic highlighted differences from studying cause-specific mortality. Our approach illustrates a novel methodology for evaluating a pandemic's impact by individual risk factor without requiring cause-specific mortality data."

https://openalex.org/W4200266180,"Climate change is impacting the function and distribution of habitats used by marine, coastal, and diadromous species. These impacts often exacerbate the anthropogenic stressors that habitats face, particularly in the coastal environment. We conducted a climate vulnerability assessment of 52 marine, estuarine, and riverine habitats in the Northeast U.S. to develop an ecosystem-scale understanding of the impact of climate change on these habitats. The trait-based assessment considers the overall vulnerability of a habitat to climate change to be a function of two main components, sensitivity and exposure, and relies on a process of expert elicitation. The climate vulnerability ranks ranged from low to very high, with living habitats identified as the most vulnerable. Over half of the habitats examined in this study are expected to be impacted negatively by climate change, while four habitats are expected to have positive effects. Coastal habitats were also identified as highly vulnerable, in part due to the influence of non-climate anthropogenic stressors. The results of this assessment provide regional managers and scientists with a tool to inform habitat conservation, restoration, and research priorities, fisheries and protected species management, and coastal and ocean planning."
https://openalex.org/W4200051038,"Serum supplementation during bovine embryo culture has been demonstrated to promote cell proliferation and preimplantation embryo development. However, these desirable outcomes, have been associated with gene expression alterations of pathways involved in macroautophagy, growth, and development at the blastocyst stage, as well as with developmental anomalies such as fetal overgrowth and placental malformations. In order to start dissecting the molecular pathways by which serum supplementation of the culture medium during the preimplantation stage promotes developmental abnormalities, we examined blastocyst morphometry, inner cell mass and trophectoderm cell allocations, macroautophagy, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. On day 5 post-insemination, > 16 cells embryos were selected and cultured in medium containing 10% serum or left as controls. Embryo diameter, inner cell mass and trophectoderm cell number, and macroautophagy were measured on day 8 blastocysts (BL) and expanded blastocysts (XBL). On day 5 and day 8, we assessed transcript level of the ER stress markers HSPA5, ATF4, MTHFD2, and SHMT2 as well as XBP1 splicing (a marker of the unfolded protein response). Serum increased diameter and proliferation of embryos when compared to the no-serum group. In addition, serum increased macroautophagy of BL when compared to controls, while the opposite was true for XBL. None of the genes analyzed was differentially expressed at any stage, except that serum decreased HSPA5 in day 5 > 16 cells stage embryos. XBP1 splicing was decreased in BL when compared to XBL, but only in the serum group. Our data suggest that serum rescues delayed embryos by alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress and promotes development of advanced embryos by decreasing macroautophagy."

https://openalex.org/W4200306285,"The impact of food taboos-often because of religion-is understudied. In Ethiopia, religious fasting by Orthodox Christians is assumed to be an important impediment for the sustainable development of a competitive dairy sector and desired higher milk consumption, especially by children. However, evidence is limited. Relying on unique data, we shed light on three major issues. First, we observe that the average annual number of fasting days that Orthodox adults are effectively adhering to is 140, less than commonly cited averages. Using this as an estimate for extrapolation, fasting is estimated to reduce annual dairy consumption by approximately 12 percent nationally. Second, farms adapt to declining milk demand during fasting by increased processing of milk into storable products-fasting contributes to larger price swings for these products. We further note continued sales of milk by non-remote farmers and reduced production-by adjusting lactation times for dairy animals-for remote farmers. Third, fasting is mostly associated with increased milk consumption by the children of dairy farmers, seemingly because of excess milk availability during fasting periods. Our results suggest that fasting habits are not a major explanation for the observed poor performance of Ethiopia's dairy sector nor low milk consumption by children. To reduce the impact of fasting on the dairy sector in Ethiopia further, investment is called for in improved milk processing, storage, and infrastructure facilities."

We aimed to investigate transitions between HIV risk levels among men who have sex with men (MSM), and identify determinants associated with behavior change. Participants in a longitudinal cohort study among HIV-negative MSM (Amsterdam Cohort Studies) completed questionnaires about their sexual behavior during biannual visits (2008-2017). Visits were assigned to different HIV risk levels, based on latent classes of behavior. We modelled transitions between risk levels, and identified determinants associated with these transitions at the visit preceding the transition using multi-state Markov models. Based on 7,865 visits of 767 participants, we classified three risk levels: low (73% of visits), medium (22%), and high risk (5%). For MSM at low risk, the six-month probability of increasing risk was 0.11. For MSM at medium risk, the probability of increasing to high risk was 0.08, while the probability of decreasing to low risk was 0.33. For MSM at high risk, the probability of decreasing risk was 0.43. Chemsex, erection stimulants and poppers, high HIV risk perception, and recent STI diagnosis were associated with increased risk at the next visit. High HIV risk perception and young age were associated with decreasing risk. Although the majority of MSM showed no behavior change, a considerable proportion increased HIV risk. Determinants associated with behavior change may help to identify MSM who are likely to increase risk in the near future and target interventions at these individuals, thereby reducing HIV transmission."

The aim of this non-interventional study was to describe the different prescription patterns used in aAPD in clinical practice and to observe outcomes characterizing volume status, dialysis efficiency, and residual renal function over 1 year. Prevalent and incident, adult aAPD patients were recruited during routine clinic visits, and aAPD prescription, volume status, residual renal function and laboratory data were documented at baseline and every quarter thereafter for 1 year. Treatments were prescribed according to the nephrologist’s medical judgement in accordance with each center’s clinical routine. Of 180 recruited patients, 160 were analyzed. 27 different aAPD prescription patterns were identified. 79 patients (49.4%) received 2 small, short dwells followed by 3 long, large dwells. During follow-up, volume status changed only marginally, with visit mean values ranging between 1.59 (95% confidence interval: 1.19; 1.99) and 1.97 (1.33; 2.61) L. Urine output and creatinine clearance decreased significantly, accompanied by reductions in ultrafiltration and Kt/V. 25 patients (15.6%) received a renal transplant and 15 (9.4%) were changed to hemodialysis. Options for individualization offered by aAPD are actually used in practice for optimized treatment. Changes observed in renal function and dialysis efficiency measures reflect the natural course of chronic kidney disease. No safety events were observed during the study period."
https://openalex.org/W4200346067,"We employed Fast Repetition Rate fluorometry for high-resolution mapping of marine phytoplankton photophysiology and primary photochemistry in the Lancaster Sound and Barrow Strait regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago in the summer of 2019. Continuous ship-board analysis of chlorophyll a variable fluorescence demonstrated relatively low photochemical efficiency over most of the cruise-track, with the exception of localized regions within Barrow Strait, where there was increased vertical mixing and proximity to land-based nutrient sources. Along the full transect, we observed strong non-photochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence, with relaxation times longer than the 5-minute period used for dark acclimation. Such long-term quenching effects complicate continuous underway acquisition of fluorescence amplitude-based estimates of photosynthetic electron transport rates, which rely on dark acclimation of samples. As an alternative, we employed a new algorithm to derive electron transport rates based on analysis of fluorescence relaxation kinetics, which does not require dark acclimation. Direct comparison of kinetics- and amplitude-based electron transport rate measurements demonstrated that kinetic-based estimates were, on average, 2-fold higher than amplitude-based values. The magnitude of decoupling between the two electron transport rate estimates increased in association with photophysiological diagnostics of nutrient stress. Discrepancies between electron transport rate estimates likely resulted from the use of different photophysiological parameters to derive the kinetics- and amplitude-based algorithms, and choice of numerical model used to fit variable fluorescence curves and analyze fluorescence kinetics under actinic light. Our results highlight environmental and methodological influences on fluorescence-based photochemistry estimates, and prompt discussion of best-practices for future underway fluorescence-based efforts to monitor phytoplankton photosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4200379744,"RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process in which nucleotide changes are introduced into an RNA sequence, many of which can contribute to proteomic sequence variation. The most common type of RNA editing, contributing to nearly 99% of all editing events in RNA, is A-to-I (adenosine-to-inosine) editing mediated by double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR) enzymes. A-to-I editing at 'recoding' sites results in non-synonymous substitutions in protein-coding sequences. Here, we present studies of the conservation of A-to-I editing in selected mRNAs between pigs, bowhead whales, humans and two shark species. All examined mRNAs-NEIL1, COG3, GRIA2, FLNA, FLNB, IGFBP7, AZIN1, BLCAP, GLI1, SON, HTR2C and ADAR2 -showed conservation of A-to-I editing of recoding sites. In addition, novel editing sites were identified in NEIL1 and GLI1 in bowhead whales. The A-to-I editing site of human NEIL1 in position 242 was conserved in the bowhead and porcine homologues. A novel editing site was discovered in Tyr244. Differential editing was detected at the two adenosines in the NEIL1 242 codon in both pig and bowhead NEIL1 mRNAs in various tissues and organs. No conservation of editing of KCNB1 and EEF1A mRNAs was seen in bowhead whales. In silico analyses revealed conservation of five adenosines in ADAR2, some of which are subject to A-to-I editing in bowheads and pigs, and conservation of a regulatory sequence in GRIA2 mRNA that is responsible for recognition of the ADAR editing enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W4200606253,"Changes in heart rate and heart rate variabilty (HRV) were investigated in untrained (UT; starting their first racing season) and detrained (DT; with 1-3 years of race experience) racehorses before and after 14-week conventional training. HRV was measured at rest over 1 h between 9:00 and 10:00 AM on the usual rest day of the horses. The smallest worthwhile change (SWC) rate was calculated for all HRV parameters. UT horses had significantly higher heart rate compared to DT (P<0.001). There were no gender- or training-related differences in heart rate. The root-mean-square of successive differences (rMSSD) in the consecutive inter-beat-intervals obtained after the 14-week training period was lower compared to pre-training rMSSD (P<0.001). The rMSSD was not influenced by breed, age or gender. In DT horses, there was a significant decrease in the high frequency (HF) component of HRV (P≤0.05) as the result of the 14-week training. These results may reflect saturation of high-frequency oscillations of inter-beat intervals rather than the reduction in parasympathetic influence on the heart. The HF did not differ significantly between the two measurements in UT horses; however, 16.6% of the animals showed a decrease in HF below SWC (P≤0.05). This supports the likelihood of parasympathetic saturation. Although no significant decrease in heart rate was found for the post-training, 30.0% of DT and 58.3% of UT horses still showed a decrease in heart rate below the SWC. Also by individual examination, it was also visible that despite significant post-training decrease in rMSSD, 1 (4.6%) DT and 2 (6.7%) UT horses reached SWC increase in rMMSD. In the case of these horses, the possibility of maladaptation should be considered. The present results indicate that similar to as found in human athletes, cardiac ANS status of racehorses also changes during the physiological adaptation to training. To explore more precise links between HRV and training effectiveness in horses, a more frequent recording would be necessary. Detailed analysis of HRV parameters based on SWC will be able to highlight the importance of fitness evaluation at individual level."

https://openalex.org/W4200256997,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in neuronal adaptations. While previous studies suggest that whole-body heating can elevate circulating BDNF concentration, this is not known for local heating protocols. This study investigated the acute effects of whole-body versus local passive heating on serum and plasma BDNF concentration. Using a water-perfused suit, ten recreationally active males underwent three 90 min experimental protocols: heating of the legs with upper-body cooling (LBH), whole-body heating (WBH) and a control condition (CON). Blood samples were collected before, immediately after and 1 h post-heating for the determination of serum and plasma BDNF concentration, platelet count as well as the BDNF release per platelet. Rectal temperature, cardiac output and femoral artery shear rate were assessed at regular intervals. Serum and plasma BDNF concentration were elevated after WBH (serum: 19.1±5.0 to 25.9±11.3 ng/ml, plasma: 2.74±0.9 to 4.58±2.0; p<0.044), but not LBH (serum: 19.1±4.7 to 22.3±4.8 ng/ml, plasma: 3.25±1.13 to 3.39±0.90 ng/ml; p>0.126), when compared with CON (serum: 18.6±6.4 to 16.8±3.4 ng/ml, plasma: 2.49±0.69 to 2.82±0.89 ng/ml); accompanied by an increase in platelet count (p<0.001). However, there was no change in BDNF content per platelet after either condition (p = 0.392). All physiological measures were elevated to a larger extent after WBH compared with LBH (p<0.001), while shear rate and rectal temperature were higher during LBH than CON (p<0.038). In conclusion, WBH but not LBH acutely elevates circulating BDNF concentration. While these findings further support the use of passive heating to elevate BDNF concentration, a larger increase in shear rate, sympathetic activity and/or rectal temperature than found after LBH appears needed to induce an acute BDNF response by passive heating."
https://openalex.org/W4200325558,"A high genetic load can negatively affect population viability and increase susceptibility to diseases and other environmental stressors. Prior microsatellite studies of two African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) populations in South Africa indicated substantial genome-wide genetic load due to high-frequency occurrence of deleterious alleles. The occurrence of these alleles, which negatively affect male body condition and bovine tuberculosis resistance, throughout most of the buffalo's range were evaluated in this study. Using available microsatellite data (2-17 microsatellite loci) for 1676 animals from 34 localities (from 25°S to 5°N), we uncovered continent-wide frequency clines of microsatellite alleles associated with the aforementioned male traits. Frequencies decreased over a south-to-north latitude range (average per-locus Pearson r = -0.22). The frequency clines coincided with a multilocus-heterozygosity cline (adjusted R2 = 0.84), showing up to a 16% decrease in southern Africa compared to East Africa. Furthermore, continent-wide linkage disequilibrium (LD) at five linked locus pairs was detected, characterized by a high fraction of positive interlocus associations (0.66, 95% CI: 0.53, 0.77) between male-deleterious-trait-associated alleles. Our findings suggest continent-wide and genome-wide selection of male-deleterious alleles driven by an earlier observed sex-chromosomal meiotic drive system, resulting in frequency clines, reduced heterozygosity due to hitchhiking effects and extensive LD due to male-deleterious alleles co-occurring in haplotypes. The selection pressures involved must be high to prevent destruction of allele-frequency clines and haplotypes by LD decay. Since most buffalo populations are stable, these results indicate that natural mammal populations, depending on their genetic background, can withstand a high genetic load."
https://openalex.org/W4200335462,"The purpose of this study was to investigate neuronal and vascular functional deficits in the retina and their association in a diabetic mouse model. We measured electroretinography (ERG) responses and choroidal and retinal blood flow (ChBF, RBF) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy and diabetic mice under basal conditions and under hypercapnic challenge.Ins2Akita diabetic (Diab, n = 8) and age-matched, wild-type C57BL/6J mice (Ctrl, n = 8) were studied under room air and moderate hypercapnia (5% CO2). Dark-adapted ERG a-wave, b-wave, and oscillatory potentials (OPs) were measured for a series of flashes. Regional ChBF and RBF under air and hypercapnia were measured using MRI in the same mice.Under room air, Diab mice had compromised ERG b-wave and OPs (e.g., b-wave amplitude was 422.2±10.7 μV in Diab vs. 600.1±13.9 μV in Ctrl, p < 0.001). Under hypercapnia, OPs and b-wave amplitudes were significantly reduced in Diab (OPs by 30.3±3.0% in Diab vs. -3.0±3.6% in Ctrl, b-wave by 17.9±1.4% in Diab vs. 1.3±0.5% in Ctrl). Both ChBF and RBF had significant differences in regional blood flow, with Diab mice having substantially lower blood flow in the nasal region (ChBF was 5.4±1.0 ml/g/min in Diab vs. 8.6±1.0 ml/g/min in Ctrl, RBF was 0.91±0.10 ml/g/min in Diab vs. 1.52±0.24 ml/g/min in Ctrl). Under hypercapnia, ChBF increased in both Ctrl and Diab without significant group difference (31±7% in Diab vs. 17±7% in Ctrl, p > 0.05), but an increase in RBF was not detected for either group.Inner retinal neuronal function and both retinal and choroidal blood flow were impaired in Diab mice. Hypercapnia further compromised inner retinal neuronal function in diabetes, while the blood flow response was not affected, suggesting that the diabetic retina has difficulty adapting to metabolic challenges due to factors other than impaired blood flow regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4200032697,"The announcement of Pfizer/BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine success on November 9, 2020 led to a global stock market surge. But how did the general public respond to such good news? We leverage the unexpected vaccine announcement to assess the effect of good news on citizens' government evaluations, anxiety, beliefs and elicited behaviors in the US and the UK. While most outcomes were unaffected by the news, trust in government and elected politicians (and their competency) saw a significant decline in both countries. As the news did not concern the governments, and the governments did not have time to act on the news, our results suggest that the decline of trust is more likely explained by the psychological impact of good news on reasoning style. In particular, we suggest two possible styles of reasoning that might explain our results: a form of motivated reasoning and a reasoning heuristic of relative comparison."

https://openalex.org/W4200183435,"This study aimed to investigate the perceived threat, mental health outcomes, behavior changes, and associated predictors among psoriasis patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 has been known to increase the health risks of patients with psoriasis owing to patients' immune dysregulation, comorbidities, and immunosuppressive drug use. A total of 423 psoriasis patients not infected with COVID-19 was recruited from the Department of Dermatology, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and China Medical University Hospital from May 2020 to July 2020. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate the perceived threat, mental health, and psychological impact on psoriasis patients using the Perceived COVID-19-Related Risk Scale score for Psoriasis (PCRSP), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress-associated symptoms (DAISS) scales, and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Over 94% of 423 patients with psoriasis perceived threat to be ≥ 1 due to COVID-19; 18% of the patients experienced psychological symptoms more frequently ≥ 1, and 22% perceived psychological impact during the pandemic to be ≥ 1. Multivariable linear regression showed that the higher psoriasis severity and comorbidities were significantly associated with higher PCRSP, DAISS, and IES-R scores. The requirement for a prolonged prescription and canceling or deferring clinic visits for psoriasis treatment among patients are the two most common healthcare-seeking behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psoriasis patients who perceived a higher COVID-19 threat were more likely to require a prolonged prescription and have their clinic visits canceled or deferred. Surveillance of the psychological consequences in psoriasis patients due to COVID-19 must be implemented to avoid psychological consequences and inappropriate treatment delays or withdrawal."

https://openalex.org/W4200376091,"Demographic changes can be observed all over the world. The number of seniors located in the societies of well-developed countries continues to rise. Both enterprises and governments need to be prepared for such changes. Consequently, public spaces need to evolve to reduce problems related to ageism and be friendly to all. Much attention is currently being paid to finding solutions for redesigning public spaces and adjusting them to the needs and requirements of senior citizens. To identify the preferences of seniors in relation to the characteristics of furniture in indoor public spaces, a survey study with 1539 respondents aged 60+ was conducted in Denmark, Finland, Latvia, Poland, Russia and Sweden. The gathered data were coded and implemented to the unified database. The statistical grouping method was used to recognize the characteristics of the needs and attitudes of seniors related to the use of public space furniture. The main variables taken into consideration in the analysis were the age and gender of respondents and their country of living. Among the most important findings are those indicating the necessity to provide the increased number of furniture for sitting in the public spaces and making sure they are not located too far away from each other. As the main disadvantages of public space furniture respondents indicated the lack of armrests or other solutions to facilitate getting up and/or sitting down, as well as profiled backrests that constitute solid support for the spine. The implementation of these data in the process of rethinking and redesigning public spaces may support the adaptation of indoor public furniture according to the requirements of a very large group of customers, namely, seniors."
