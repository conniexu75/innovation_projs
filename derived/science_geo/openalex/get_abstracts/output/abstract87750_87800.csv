https://openalex.org/W1973758214,"A large scale purification protocol employing zonal rotor centrifugation has been developed for scrapie prions. The extensively purified fractions derived using this protocol contained only one major protein, designated PrP, and rod-shaped particles. The rods measured 10 to 20 nm in diameter and 100 to 200 nm in length by negative staining; no other particles were consistently observed. SDS denaturation caused the rods to disappear, prion infectivity to diminish, and PrP to become sensitive to protease digestion. Arrays of prion rods ultrastructurally resembled purified amyloid and showed green birefringence by polarization microscopy after staining with Congo red dye. The rods appear to represent a polymeric form of the scrapie prion; each rod may contain as many as 1,000 PrP molecules. Our findings raise the possibility that the amyloid plaques observed in transmissible, degenerative neurological diseases might consist of prions."

https://openalex.org/W2056274413,"The human carcinoma HEp3 grows on the chorioallantoic membrane and metastasizes to the chicken embryo with kinetics that are quantitatively predictable. We have used this experimental system to test whether plasminogen activator produced by the tumor is required for metastasis. Rabbit antibodies were raised against human urinary urokinase; these cross-reacted with and blocked the catalytic activity of HEp3-PA but did not inhibit chicken PA. When administered intravenously to embryos that had received an inoculum of HEp3 cells, the anti-urokinase antibodies did not inhibit tumor growth at the site of primary inoculation on the chorioallantoic membrane, but they either prevented or strongly inhibited metastasis to the embryo lung. Antibody treatment delayed the onset of pulmonary metastasis, indicating that plasminogen activator is required during early stages of the process."
https://openalex.org/W2034376730,"Mammalian cardiac atria have several biologically active peptides that exert profound effects on sodium excretion, urine volume, and smooth muscle tone. In the present study two such peptides of low molecular weight were purified and separated from each other on the basis of differences in charge, hydrophobicity, and biological profile. The first peptide, designated atriopeptin I, exhibits natriuretic and diuretic activity and selectivity relaxes intestinal smooth muscle but not vascular smooth muscle strips. The second peptide, atriopeptin II, is a potent natriuretic and diuretic that relaxes both intestinal and vascular strips. Sequence analysis of atriopeptin I indicates that it is composed of 21 amino acids, of which serine and glycine residues predominate. The amino terminal sequence of atriopeptin II up to residue 21 is the same as that of atriopeptin I, with the addition of the Phe-Arg extension at the carboxyl terminus. Both peptides appear to be derived from a common high molecular weight precursor (designated atriopeptigen); their biological selectivity and potency may be determined by the site of carboxyl terminal cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2027199315,"The compound eye of D. melanogaster is a reiterative pattern of facets, each containing eight photoreceptor cells in a precise arrangement. This pattern is established in the eye imaginal disc during the third larval instar. A wave of morphogenesis sweeps from posterior to anterior across the disc, leaving in its wake organized clusters of photoreceptor cells. We have used monoclonal antibodies to highlight pattern elements that are not readily observable by other techniques. Monoclonal antibodies can be used to identify the molecules associated with particular patterns, providing links between observable structures and the genes. As an example, we present the purification and N-terminal sequence of a glycoprotein antigen specific to photoreceptor cells and their axons."

https://openalex.org/W2080024031,"A hybrid gene that consists of the Drosophila heat shock gene, hsp70, fused to the E. coli beta-galactosidase gene has been introduced into the Drosophila germline by the P element microinjection method. This hybrid includes 194 bp of sequence upstream of the start of the hsp70 transcript. Three strains of transformed flies were isolated and characterized by DNA blotting experiments and by in situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes. Strain Bg61 has a single insert of the hybrid gene at the tip of chromosome 3L, site 61A, and the insert consists of a structure that is consistent with P-element-mediated transposition. Strain Bg9,61 has inserts at both 61A and 9E, while Bg64 has a single insert at 64D. Heat shock induces the formation of a large chromosomal puff at all three sites. These puffs appear and regress with kinetics indistinguishable from the puffing of the heat shock locus, 87C, from which the hsp70 gene, used in these studies, was isolated. The beta-galactosidase activity in the transformants is inducible by heat shock and shows a widespread distribution throughout the tissues of larvae and adults."
https://openalex.org/W2055013769,"The Antennapedia complex (ANT-C) of Drosophila is a cluster of genes involved in the regulation of morphogenesis, including at least three homoeotic loci (Antp, Scr, and pb), in which mutations cause switches of cell fates from one developmental pathway to another. We have isolated DNA clones containing most of the ANT-C, a region of about 300 kb. Antp mutations are distributed across more than 100 kb of the ANT-C. Dominant Antp mutations are associated with certain chromosome rearrangements and insertions that interrupt the 100 kb region; other chromosome breaks within the region cause recessive lethality and have no dominant effects. Two prominent transcripts (3.5 and 5.0 kb) are derived from exons within and at the two ends of the 100 kb region."

https://openalex.org/W1600000166,"We have used the enzyme cholesterol oxidase, which catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one, to examine the distribution of cholesterol in cultured fibroblasts, Chinese hamster ovary cells, and isolated rat liver hepatocytes. While the plasma membrane normally was not attacked by cholesterol oxidase, we found that treating cells with low ionic strength buffer and glutaraldehyde rendered their cholesterol highly susceptible to oxidation. Most of the cholesterol was oxidized in all three cell types: 94% in fibroblasts, 92% in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and 80% in hepatocytes. Given that the enzyme had access only to the outer surface of the cells and cholesterol can move rapidly across the fixed plasma membrane, these values are taken to reflect the fraction of cellular cholesterol present in the plasma membrane. Additional experiments confirmed this interpretation. Fibroblasts were labeled with [3H]cholesterol by brief exposure to exogenous radiolabel and incubated with [14C]mevalonic acid to label cholesterol biosynthetically. Cholesterol oxidase attacked at least 97% of the exogenous label but as little as 10% of the biosynthetically labeled cholesterol. These data suggest that the cholesterol oxidase did not reach the intracellular pool and that cholesterol in the plasma membrane is not in rapid equilibrium with internal membranes. A study of the transfer of cholesterol to plasma from cells labeled biosynthetically with [3H]cholesterol and exogenously with [14C]cholesterol confirmed the different subcellular distribution of the two labels. These studies demonstrate that an unexpectedly high proportion of cell cholesterol is associated with plasma membranes and that this cholesterol pool can be rapidly and selectively labeled and oxidized. These features make cholesterol a useful specific marker for the plasma membrane."

Mice that integrated the injected gene were mated and the DNA, RNA and serum kappa chains of their offspring were analysed. The data from offspring of three different transgenic mice indicate that the microinjected gene is expressed in the spleen, but not the liver of mice which inherited the injected gene."
https://openalex.org/W1493647971,"Human platelets contain an enzyme that catalyzes CoA-independent release of arachidonic acid from phosphatidylcholine with concomitant incorporation into plasmenylethanolamine. Addition of lysoplasmenylethanolamine (10-80 microM) to a crude membrane preparation of prelabeled platelets (0.24 mg of protein/ml) induces transfer of [3H]arachidonate from endogenous phosphatidylcholine to lysoplasmenylethanolamine (0.8 nmol of arachidonic acid/min/mg of protein). The transacylation reaction occurs in the absence of Ca2+, has a broad pH optimum from 7 to 8, is not affected by excess unlabeled arachidonic acid, and is inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide (0.2 mM) and Triton X-100 (0.1 mg/ml). The enzyme shows a high specificity toward the acyl donor (phosphatidylcholine), transfers fatty acids in the order: arachidonic greater than eicosatrienoic greater than oleic, and preferentially acylates lysoplasmenylethanolamine but also other lysophosphatides (lysophosphatidylethanolamine greater than lysophosphatidylserine greater than lysophosphatidylinositol = 0). Platelet acyltransferase, on the other hand, acylates ethanolamine lysophosphatides with free arachidonic acid in the order: lysophosphatidyl-ethanolamine greater than lysoplasmenylethanolamine. These results suggest that a distinct acylation mechanism exists for introduction of arachidonic acid into plasmalogen phosphatides. In stimulated platelets, the transacylase may play an additional role in the controlled release of esterified arachidonic acid for synthesis of the biologically active oxygenated metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1502181170,"Substrate ribulose bisphosphate is a potent and a weak inhibitor of the rate of CO2/Mg2+ activation in the carboxylase purified from spinach leaves and Rhodospirillum rubrum, respectively. At 2 degrees C, the concentration of ribulose bisphosphate required for 50% inhibition of the initial rate of CO2/Mg2+ activation was less than 0.4 microM for the spinach enzyme, but between 67 and 270 microM for the R. rubrum carboxylase. Activator 14CO2 trapping experiments demonstrated that ribulose bisphosphate inhibits activation by excluding activator CO2 from the spinach enzyme. The reason for the different sensitivities to inhibition by substrate was evident from equilibrium binding studies with the inactive enzyme forms which indicated that the KD (ribulose bisphosphate) was 0.021 microM for spinach enzyme and 5.9 microM for the R. rubrum protein. Inhibition of activation, however, was not explained by the equilibrium binding results alone. Ribulose bisphosphate was observed to dissociate very slowly from the inactive spinach enzyme (at 2 degrees C, kOFF = 4.9 X 10(-5) s-1). The release of substrate from the inactive R. rubrum carboxylase was much more rapid, with a minimum value for kOFF estimated at 5 X 10(-3) s-1 at 2 degrees C. We conclude that strong inhibition of CO2/Mg2+ activation in the spinach enzyme is mediated by the tight binding and slow release of ribulose bisphosphate, which prevent activator CO2 and Mg2+ from binding to the protein. Weak inhibition of activation in the R. rubrum enzyme results from a larger KD value and a more rapid exchange of ribulose bisphosphate, which allow activator CO2 and Mg2+ to bind to the free enzyme between successive substrate-binding events."
https://openalex.org/W1583894029,"The tripeptide hypothalamic releasing factor, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), rapidly increases prolactin gene transcription 7- to 12-fold in the GH4 rat pituitary cell line. The maximal rates of transcription are achieved within minutes and begin to attenuate within 1 h following addition of TRH. This transcriptional response appears to account for the observed effects of TRH on the accumulation of prolactin mRNA and the stimulation of prolactin biosynthesis. The rapid transcriptional effects of TRH include a large number of polymerase II-catalyzed transcription units. Addition of TRH to GH4 cell cultures also rapidly induces the phosphorylation of a 23,000-dalton chromatin-associated basic protein, distinct from known high mobility group or histone proteins and referred to as basic regulated phosphoprotein. The time course of TRH-stimulated prolactin transcription and basic regulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation demonstrates that the signal generated by TRH binding to its plasma membrane receptor rapidly reaches the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2166730070,"DNA sequence analysis of a class I gene (Q10), which maps to the Qa2,3 locus in the C57BL/10 (H-2b haplotype) mouse, reveals that it is almost identical to a cDNA clone (pH16) isolated from a SWR/J (H-2q haplotype) mouse liver cDNA library. Exon 5, in particular, has an unusual structure such that a polypeptide product is unlikely to be anchored in the cell membrane. Our findings suggest that the two sequences are derived from allelic class I genes, which are nonpolymorphic, in contrast to H-2K allelic sequences from the same mice, and they may encode liver-specific polypeptides of unknown function. Our previous studies indicate that the Q10 gene is a potential donor gene for the generation of mutations at the H-2K locus by inter-gene transfer of genetic information. Thus the lack of polymorphism in class I genes at the Q10 locus implies either that they are not recipients for such exchanges or that selective pressure prevents the accumulation of mutations in genes at this locus."
https://openalex.org/W1998340580,"We have recovered a conserved transcribed component of the snake W chromosome satellite DNA (Bkm) from Drosophila and male mouse libraries. This consists of repeats of the tetranucleotide GATA that are concentrated in the sex-determining region of the Y chromosome of mouse, on the W chromosome of snakes, and in the proximal region of the X chromosome of D. melanogaster, and it appears to be transcribed in a sex-specific and developmentally regulated manner. Sequencing studies show that, unlike most other transcribed repeats, the GATA repeats potentially contain open reading frames. These encode mainly the amino acids leucine, serine, isoleucine, and tyrosine but with occasional variant codons that differ in different clonal isolates. Transcription is exclusive to the GATA strand in different tissues of the same organism and in different unrelated organisms. The complementary strand CTAT contains stop codons in all reading frames. The possible developmental significance of these sequences is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1992835107,"Secretory IgA dimer antibodies in exosecretions provide the primary immunological defense for mucosal surfaces. Transmission of IgA2 across the epithelia of mucous and exocrine glands is mediated by a receptor called secretory component (SC). Using three antibodies directed against different domains of SC, we examine its processing in the lactating rabbit mammary gland. SC is synthesized as a core glycosylated transmembrane glycoprotein on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Pulse-chase experiments reveal the time course of SC maturation in the Golgi, as demonstrated by the acquisition of Endo H resistance (30-60 min). The subsequent routing of SC to the basolateral plasma membrane, where IgA2 binding and endocytosis occurs, the cleavage of the membrane anchoring domain of SC, and the exocytosis from the apical plasma membrane of IgA, bound to the ectoplasmic domain of SC takes place rapidly (30-60 min). Thus maturation in the Golgi may represent the rate limiting step in SC routing. We also demonstrate that SC exists in several conformational states that are processed at different rates."
https://openalex.org/W1602552977,"Cultured fibroblasts were examined from a patient with a nonlethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta. As reported previously (Nicholls, A. C., Pope, F. M., and Schloon, H. (1979) Lancet 1, 1193), the cells synthesized and secreted a type I procollagen which lacked pro-alpha 2(I) chains and consisted of a trimer of pro-alpha 1(I) chains. No pro-alpha 2(I) chains were recovered from the medium under conditions in which nonhelical pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains were readily detected in the medium of normal fibroblasts incubated with the hydroxylase inhibitor, alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl. Examination of cellular proteins demonstrated that the fibroblasts synthesized both pro-alpha 1(I) and pro-alpha 2(I) chains. The cellular pro-alpha 2(I) chains did not, however, become disulfide-linked into dimers or trimers of pro-alpha chains. Since the association of pro-alpha chains during the biosynthesis of type I procollagen is directed by the conformation of the COOH-terminal propeptides, the data suggest that the pro-alpha 2(I) chains synthesized by the fibroblasts have a mutated structure in the COOH-terminal propeptides which markedly reduces their affinity for pro-alpha 1(I) chains. A further observation was that the ratio of newly synthesized pro-alpha (I):pro-alpha 2(I) chains in the patient's fibroblasts was 7.18 +/- 0.58 S.E. instead of the value of 2.25 +/- 0.16 S.E. seen in control fibroblasts. One possible explanation for the high ratio is that the proband is homozygous for a mutation altering the structure of the pro-alpha 2(I) chain and that a secondary effect of the structural mutation is a decreased rate of synthesis of pro-alpha 2(I) chains."

https://openalex.org/W1630477067,"Incubations of thyroid microsomes with radiolabeled dolichyl pyrophosphoryl oligosaccharide (Glc3Man9-GlcNAc2) under conditions optimal for the N-glycosylation of protein resulted in the release, by apparently independent enzymatic reactions, of two types of neutral glucosylated polymannose oligosaccharides which differed from each other by terminating either in an N-acetylglucosamine residue (Glc3Man9GlcNAc1) or a di-N-acetylchitobiose moiety (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2). The first mentioned oligosaccharide, which was released in a steady and slow process unaffected by the addition of EDTA, appeared to be primarily the product of endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase action on newly synthesized glycoprotein and such an enzyme with a neutral pH optimum capable of hydrolyzing exogenous glycopeptides and oligosaccharides (Km = 18 microM) was found in the thyroid microsomal fraction. The Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide, in contrast, appeared to originate from the oligosaccharide-lipid by a rapid hydrolysis reaction which closely paralleled the N-glycosylation step, progressing as long as oligosaccharide transfer to protein occurred and terminating when carbohydrate attachment ceased either due to limitation of lipid-saccharide donor or addition of EDTA. There was a striking similarity between oligosaccharide release and transfer to protein with lipid-linked Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 serving as a 10-fold better substrate for both reactions than lipid-linked Man9-8GlcNAc2. The coincidence of transferase and hydrolase activities suggest the possibility of the existence of one enzyme with both functions. The physiological relevance of oligosaccharide release was indicated by the formation of such molecules in thyroid slices radiolabeled with [2-3H]mannose. Large oligosaccharides predominated (12 nmol/g) and consisted of two families of components; one group terminating in N-acetylglucosamine, ranged from Glc1Man9GlcNAc1 to Man5GlcNAc1 while the other contained the di-N-acetylchitobiose sequence and included Glc3Man9GlcNAc2, Glc1Man9GlcNAc2, and Man9GlcNAc2."
https://openalex.org/W1507316687,"Structural studies are reported on seven hybrid proteins produced by gene fusions that contain a foreign amino acid sequence substituting for part of the NH2-terminal region of the beta-galactosidase polypeptide. All of these hybrid proteins retain beta-galactosidase enzyme activity. A simple and rapid purification scheme for the hybrid beta-galactosidase is described, involving ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-Bio-Gel, and Bio-Gel A-1.5 chromatography. The proteins are tetramers and have activity equivalent to that of wild type enzyme. Their amino acid sequences were determined by isolation and sequence determination of the cyanogen bromide peptide containing the joining site. The subunit sizes vary from 1009 to 1355 residues compared to 1023 for wild type. Up to 26 amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus of beta-galactosidase can be substituted by the new sequence. The nature of the new sequence apparently has no influence on stability or activity of the hybrid, but those hybrids with more of the beta-galactosidase sequence deleted are less stable to heat or urea treatment and tend to dissociate to dimeric form. All hybrids are less stable to heat and urea than wild type. Antipeptide antibodies raised against peptides derived from the NH2-terminal region of wild type beta-galactosidase were found to bind to the hybrid proteins, although they do not bind to the normal enzyme. These results indicate that the quaternary structure is disturbed but not disrupted by substitution of the different sequence, and these results help to localize one of the intersubunit contact regions in beta-galactosidase."
https://openalex.org/W1666449145,"Vinculin phosphorylation by pp60src is stimulated by anionic phospholipids (Ito, S., Richert, N., and Pastan, I. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 4628-4631). We have examined whether vinculin interacts with phospholipids, the specificity of the interactions, and a possible mechanism for the enhancement of vinculin phosphorylation by these phospholipids. 3H-labeled vinculin binds to phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidic acid. No binding to phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine was observed. The phospholipid binding specificity correlated with the ability of these phospholipids to enhance vinculin phosphorylation by the src kinase. Chlorpromazine (0.1 and 0.3 mM) inhibited both vinculin binding to phosphatidylinositol and the enhanced phosphorylation of vinculin by pp60src in the presence of phosphatidylinositol. Tryptic peptide maps of vinculin phosphorylated in the absence of phospholipid revealed three phosphorylated peptides. The same three peptides were phosphorylated in the presence of phospholipid. However, phosphorylation at one site was markedly increased. In the presence of phospholipid proteolysis of vinculin with both chymotrypsin and V8 protease was markedly enhanced and different peptide maps of vinculin were generated. Microheterogeneity of vinculin was observed with isoelectric focusing. All the isoforms (pI 5.45-5.8) were found to bind phospholipids and undergo phosphorylation by the src kinase. These results suggest that one way anionic phospholipids can enhance vinculin phosphorylation is by binding to vinculin and inducing a conformational change in the vinculin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1536996234,"Trypsin treatment of a partially purified insulin receptor preparation from rat adipocytes stimulated the phosphorylation of 90,000- and 72,000-Da polypeptides immunoprecipitated by anti-insulin receptor antibody. The phosphorylation of tyrosine residues alone was observed in both polypeptides. Trypsin concentrations which stimulated insulin receptor phosphorylation were the same as those previously shown to activate rat adipocyte glycogen synthase. Trypsin treatment of the insulin receptor fraction also stimulated the phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate of tyrosine kinase similarly to insulin treatment. Trypsin treatment of a highly purified insulin receptor from human placenta also activated the phosphorylation of the receptor-derived peptides. These results suggest that the insulin-stimulated protein kinase, a component of the insulin receptor, was activated by tryptic digestion to phosphorylate polypeptides derived from the insulin receptor itself. Thus, it is suggested that stimulation by trypsin of phosphorylation of the insulin receptor may be related to the insulin-like metabolic actions of trypsin observed in rat adipocytes."

When inorganic phosphate labeled with phosphorus-32 was fed to flies, the radioactive label was incorporated into these polypeptides during the pI changes, indicating light-induced phosphorylation of the polypeptides. A 1-millisecond flash induced a detectable amount of phosphorylation in the 80- and 49-kilodalton polypeptides within 3 seconds. These results, and our previous results with norpA mutants, suggest that phosphorylation of these two polypeptides may be involved in some early stages of photoreceptor excitation or its modulation."
https://openalex.org/W2092161964,Treatment of nonpolar ether extracts of human female blood with mild alkali produced more immunoassayable estradiol than the unhydrolyzed extract. Analysis of the serum extracts showed that the substance which released immunoreactive estradiol after hydrolysis has chromatographic properties identical to those of fatty acid esters of estradiol esterified at carbon 17. The physiological role of these previously unknown endogenous esters might be inferred from their structural similarity to synthetic drugs used therapeutically for their prolonged estrogenic action.

Three major polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 47,000, 40,000, and 31,000 were found intracellularly and one of 64,000 in the medium. Pulse-chase labeling and uptake experiments showed that arylsulfatase B synthesized and secreted as a 64,000 precursor was intracellularly processed within less than 24 h via short lived intermediates to two different forms. Form I (chains of 47,000 and 11,500) was labeled earlier and was about twice as stable as form II (chains of 40,000 and 31,000). The secreted 64,000 precursor and the 40,000 chain of form II contained oligosaccharides resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H. In the other chains mainly cleavable and phosphorylated oligosaccharides were found. Arylsulfatase B activity was associated with the 64,000 precursor and with form I, but not with form II. Fibroblasts of four patients with the severe form of mucopolysaccharidosis type VI, which were deficient in arylsulfatase B activity, synthesized and secreted the 64,000 precursor at a normal rate. This precursor, however, had little if any catalytic activity and one of its mature forms (I) was rapidly degraded."

https://openalex.org/W1503818339,"Cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages were fractionated by two methods at various times after pulse labeling with [35S]methionine. The lysosomal enzymes beta-glucuronidase and beta-galactosidase were isolated from each fraction by immunoprecipitation and electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels. Two distinct peaks of label were obtained on Percoll density gradients. An early appearing peak of low density, containing the precursor forms of both enzymes, co-sedimented with markers for the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, and the plasma membrane. With time, immunoprecipitable label cosedimented with the bulk of the lysosomal enzyme activity at high density and corresponded to the mature forms of the lysosomal enzymes. By differential centrifugation, newly synthesized enzymes were found predominantly in small particle fractions, unlike the bulk of the lysosomal enzymic activity which was found in larger particle fractions. With increasing time, newly synthesized enzymes were transferred to assume a distribution similar to that of lysosomal enzymic activity. The results suggest that transport of newly synthesized enzymes to lysosomes and conversion to mature forms are closely linked events. Conversion of lysosomal precursors to mature forms occurs either in a prelysosomal vesicle or shortly after reaching the lysosome. The two enzymes follow similar subcellular pathways at similar rates. Also, the macrophage system appears suitable for direct analysis of newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes during subcellular transport."
https://openalex.org/W1531207518,"Stretching to 1.7 times the resting length of porcine carotid arteries reversibly prevents active tension development by K+ or norepinephrine stimulation. The 20,000-dalton light chain of myosin was maximally phosphorylated in the stretched noncontracting muscles, equal to that in the nonstretched contracting muscles challenged with K+ or norepinephrine. These results show that the contractile event is not a prerequisite for phosphorylation. Furthermore, stretching alone also induced maximal light chain phosphorylation even in the absence of K+ or norepinephrine. The stretch-induced light chain phosphorylation was not affected by exhaustive washing of the muscle with Ca2+-free physiological salt solution, treatment of the muscle with verapamil, or by a short exposure to ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Prolonged EGTA treatment abolished the stretch-induced light chain phosphorylation. All evidence suggests that upon stretch, Ca2+ is released from intracellular sources and this Ca2+ activates the myosin light chain kinase producing phosphorylation of the light chain."
https://openalex.org/W1531103647,"Abstract Agents that affect intracellular cation and pH gradients and inhibit energy production have been tested for their ability to modulate the processing and secretion of the free alpha subunit and the alpha beta dimer of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by cultured human trophoblastic cells (JAR). Incubation of JAR cells with monensin or nigericin, monovalent cation ionophores that produce equilibration of Na+ and K+ across cellular membranes, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, an agent that inhibits intracellular membrane ATPases, and methylamine, which neutralizes intracellular pH gradients, produced similar effects on hCG processing and secretion. All these agents inhibited the processing of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chains of free alpha subunit and the alpha and beta subunits contained in the hCG dimer. Moreover, after treatment of JAR cells with these agents, there was an intracellular accumulation of precursor forms and an inhibition of secretion of mature forms of hCG. Monensin affected the processing and secretion of hCG subunits differently at different concentrations. At 5 X 10(-7) M, monensin inhibited the processing of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of hCG without altering the rate-limiting step in the secretory pathway or blocking hCG secretion. The intracellular hCG subunit precursors in both control and monensin-treated cells contained a similar array of high mannose oligosaccharides, predominantly of the Man8GlcNAc2 and Man9GlcNAc2 types. However, monensin-treated cells secreted hCG subunits that contained endo H-sensitive oligosaccharides of the high mannose (mostly Man5GlcNAc2) and hybrid types rather than the endo H-resistant complex chains synthesized by control cells. Nevertheless, a full complement of serine-linked oligosaccharides was added to the hCG-beta subunit in monensin-treated cells. These results indicate that the intracellular movement of hCG from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface was not inhibited by monensin at a concentration that impaired Golgi-localized steps in the processing of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides. At 5 X 10(-6) M, monensin significantly inhibited secretion of hCG and created a new rate-limiting step in the processing pathway. hCG subunits bearing Man5GlcNAc2 units accumulated intracellularly, suggesting that the equilibration of intracellular Na+/K+ pools blocked oligosaccharide processing at an intra-Golgi point, perhaps by inhibiting movement of the glycoprotein hormone from the cis to the trans Golgi compartment. Since the other drugs mentioned above produced similar effects on hCG processing and secretion, it appears that maintenance of intracellular cation and pH gradients is necessary for the intra-Golgi transport of glycoprotein hormones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1602589000,"A purification procedure for a protein related to lactoperoxidase devoid of the heme prosthetic group under conditions also yielding enzymatically active lactoperoxidase is described. These two forms were separated from bovine milk according to their respective behaviors on cation exchange. Lactoperoxidase and non-heme lactoperoxidase had the same apparent molecular weight in the denatured (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and native form (velocity sedimentation on sucrose gradient) about 85,000; but unlike lactoperoxidase, non-heme lactoperoxidase was devoid of light absorption properties in the Soret region and of enzyme activity. Lactoperoxidase and non-heme lactoperoxidase contained a similar amount of carbohydrate and gave very similar peptide maps after limited proteolysis by subtilisin or trypsin. The two forms appeared to be immunologically related since they gave a single line in immunodiffusion using anti-lactoperoxidase antibodies and since 125I-labeled non-heme lactoperoxidase and 125I-labeled lactoperoxidase reacted with anti-lactoperoxidase antibodies in radioimmunoassay. Lactoperoxidase and nonheme lactoperoxidase were compared in their ability to interact with diiodotyrosine and tubulin (Rousset, B., and Wolff, J. (1980) J. Biol.

In contrast, lactoperoxidase and non-heme lactoperoxidase coupled to an insoluble matrix were able to bind rat brain tubulin, indicating that both forms of lactoperoxidase can be used for an affinity chromatography purification procedure of brain tubulin. Non-heme lactoperoxidase was found in milk from several origins, cow, goat, sheep, and human. In bovine milk, lactoperoxidase and non-heme lactoperoxidase were found in comparable amounts."

https://openalex.org/W1637561289,"The inorganic ion contents of platelet alpha-granules were determined by a combination of neutron activation analysis and flame photometry. Total concentrations were estimated using intragranular water spaces measured by isotope dilution. To measure the free concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ we developed a novel double null point titration technique. The method requires independent determinations of transmembrane delta pH and the availability of two divalent cation-H+ exchange ionophores with different Ca2+/Mg2+ selectivity ratios. A23187 and the halogenated analog 4-bromo-A23187 were used for this purpose. Absolute delta pH was measured by methylamine distribution, while relative pH changes induced by the ionophores were monitored with 9-aminoacridine. The free concentrations of Ca2+ and Mg2+ were found to be 12 and 326 microM, respectively. These values are markedly lower than the calculated total concentrations of these cations, i.e. 32 mM for Ca2+ and 172 mM for Mg2+."
https://openalex.org/W1686868547,"The kinetics of the interaction between the 50 S subunits (R) of bacterial ribosomes and the antibiotics virginiamycin S (VS), virginiamycin M (VM), and erythromycin have been studied by stopped flow fluorimetric analysis, based on the enhancement of VS fluorescence upon its binding to the 50 S ribosomal subunit. Virginiamycin components M and S exhibit a synergistic effect in vivo, which is characterized in vitro by a 5- to 10-fold increase of the affinity of ribosomes for VS, and by the loss of the ability of erythromycin to displace VS subsequent to the conformational change (from R to R*) produced by transient contact of ribosomes with VM. Our kinetic studies show that the VM-induced increase of the ribosomal affinity for VS (K*VS = 25 X 10(6) M-1 instead of KVS = 5.5 X 10(6) M-1) is due to a decrease of the dissociation rate constant (k*-VS = 0.008 s-1 instead of 0.04 s-1). The association rate constant remains practically the same (k+VS approximately k*+VS = 2.8 X 10(5) M-1 s-1), irrespective of the presence of VM. VS and erythromycin bind competitively to ribosomes. This effect has been exploited to determine the dissociation rate constant of VS directly by displacement experiments from VS . 50 S complexes, and the association rate constant of erythromycin (k+Ery = 3.2 X 10(5) M-1 S-1) on the basis of competition experiments for binding of free erythromycin and VS to ribosomes. By making use of the change in competition behavior of erythromycin and VS, after interaction of ribosomes with VM, the conformational change induced by VM has been explored. Within the experimentally available concentration region, the catalytic effect of VM has been shown to be coupled to its binding kinetics, and the association rate constant of VM has been determined (k+VM = 1.4 X 10(4) M-1 S-1). Evidence is presented for a low affinity binding of erythromycin (K*Ery approximately 3.3 X 10(4) M-1) to ribosomes altered by contact with VM. A model involving a sequence of 5 reactions has been proposed to explain the replacement of ribosome-bound erythromycin by VS upon contact of 50 S subunits with VM."
https://openalex.org/W1508813753,"Abstract The three tandemly repeated ribosomal RNA operons from the chloroplast genome of Euglena gracilis Klebs, Pringsheim Strain Z each contain a 5 S rRNA gene distal to the 23 S rRNA gene (Gray, P.W., and Hallick, R.B. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 1820-1825). We have cloned two distinct 5 S rRNA genes, and determined the DNA sequence of the genes, their 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences, and the 3'-end of the adjacent 23 S rRNA genes. The two genes exhibit sequence polymorphism at five bases within the procaryotic loop coding region, as well as internal restriction endonuclease site heterogeneity. These restriction endonuclease site polymorphisms are evident in chloroplast DNA, and not just the cloned examples of 5 S genes. Chloroplast 5 S rRNA was isolated, end labeled, and sequenced by partial enzymatic degradation. The same polymorphisms found in 5 S rDNA are present in 5 S rRNA. Therefore, both types of 5 S rRNA genes are transcribed and are present in chloroplast ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1678904383,"Abstract Until recently, liver and intestinal mucosa were believed to be the sole sites of synthesis of apolipoprotein A1 (Apo-A1), the major protein component of serum high density lipoprotein particles. We recently showed (Shackelford, J.E., and Lebherz, H.G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 7175-7180) that chick breast muscle also synthesizes and secretes Apo-A1 but does so at high rates only around the time of hatching. In the present work, we investigate the regulation of synthesis of Apo-A1 in chicken muscles. 1) The primary translation product encoded for by muscle Apo-A1 mRNA is about 2600 daltons larger than the mature serum protein which is consistent with the idea that, like its mammalian liver counterpart, chick muscle Apo-A1 mRNA codes for an NH2-terminal extension (prepro segment) which is 24 amino acids long. 2) The developmentally regulated rise and fall in muscle Apo-A1 synthesis which occurs around the time of hatching is associated with a large accumulation followed by depletion of Apo-A1 mRNA molecules during this period. 3) Reinitiation of Apo-A1 synthesis to high levels in mature breast muscle occurred in vivo following surgical denervation and in vitro by maintaining breast muscle explants for several days in defined culture media. 4) Cardiac, but not smooth, muscles also synthesize and secrete Apo-A1 at high levels around the time of hatching. These and other observations are discussed in terms of possible regulatory signals which may control Apo-A1 synthesis in avian muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1495569011,"Abstract E-5-(2-Bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridylate (BrvdUMP), the first metabolite in the processing of the antiviral agent E-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BrvdUrd), is an excellent alternate substrate for dTMP synthetase. The nucleophilic catalyst of the enzyme adds to the 6-position of the heterocycle and converts the normally inert 5-bromovinyl group of BrvdUMP to a reactive allylic bromide in which both carbons of the side chain are susceptible to nucleophilic attack. These centers react with nucleophiles in the reaction mixture, 2-mercaptoethanol and water, to give three diastereomeric products which have been isolated and characterized. Possible implications of these findings as related to the mechanism and selectivity of BrvdUrd as an antiviral agent are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1606856840,"RNA polymerase I has been purified from the silk glands of the silkworm and antibodies obtained from immunized BALB/C mice. Hybridomas were obtained by fusing spleen cells from the same mice with SP-2/0 cells. One of the cloned hybridomas was injected into mice to produce ascitic fluid. Both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were characterized for their reactivity with polymerase I by double immunodiffusion, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and enzyme inhibition. The monoclonal antibody is active even at 1:100,000 dilution, is specific for the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase I, and does show some cross-reactivity with polymerases II and III. The monoclonal antibody when coupled to Sepharose binds polymerase I from crude extracts, and the bound polymerase I can be eluted. This antibody has been employed to localize RNA polymerase to the nuclei of Chironomus salivary glands. This and other monoclonal antibodies will be of considerable help as probes for the study of structure and function of RNA polymerases during active transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1580698616,"The activity of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway has been measured in resistant and sensitive murine tumors in vivo following a single intraperitoneal dose of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) (400 mg/kg). For these studies, we utilized a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometric technique which enabled measurement of 13C incorporation from 13CO2 into the uracil nucleotide pool (sigma uracil) of tumors in situ. Flux through the de novo pathway was 75-85% inhibited 1 h after PALA treatment in both sensitive (Lewis lung carcinoma) and the resistant (L1210) tumors, but there was a lag time before this inhibition was reflected in reduced sigma uracil pools. The activity of the pathway in the Lewis lung carcinoma tumors remained maximally depressed (5-15% of control activity) for up to 48 h after the dose of PALA. In contrast, flux through the pathway of L1210 tumors remained 80% inhibited for up to 4 h following PALA administration, but recovered to 70% of control activity between 4 and 12 h after PALA treatment. Recovery of the remaining 30% of control activity in the L1210 tumor was at a much slower rate requiring between 12 and 48 h after PALA treatment to regain full activity of the pathway. This recovery of flux through the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway did not correlate with the measurement of recovery of aspartate transcarbamylase activity in similarly treated tumors. These data argue strongly in favor of the importance of the de novo biosynthetic pathway, rather than salvage mechanisms, for determining in vivo sensitivity or resistance of these tumors to PALA treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1491587119,"The relationship between the process of neural induction and the control of tyrosinase gene expression in the cells that derive from the neural crest of amphibians has been examined at the molecular level. [3H] Tyrosinase cDNA was utilized as a probe to measure the levels of tyrosinase RNA transcripts present in Rana pipiens embryos from the time of fertilization through Stage 25 of cleavage (operculum complete, 240 h) and to correlate these levels with those published for the rate of tyrosinase protein synthesis. R. pipiens [3H]tyrosinase cDNA was synthesized from a purified tyrosinase mRNA template using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and was enriched for full length copies by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This cDNA product was estimated to represent greater than 90% by length of tyrosinase mRNA and hybridized to tyrosinase mRNA to greater than 97% within two orders of magnitude of R0t values. The extent of hybridization of [3H]tyrosinase cDNA to total embryonic RNA throughout early development paralleled the rate of synthesis of tyrosinase protein. Tyrosinase RNA transcripts were first detected at Stage 12-13 (0.0032% of total RNA) and rose to maximal levels by Stage 19 (0.011%). This represents a 50-fold increase from preinduction levels. These results are consistent with a model which predicts that one of the early events in the development of neural crest derivatives is the transcriptionally dependent accumulation of functionally mature tyrosinase mRNA."
