https://openalex.org/W2887249435,"Tumour cells evade immune surveillance by upregulating the surface expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which interacts with programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor on T cells to elicit the immune checkpoint response1,2. Anti-PD-1 antibodies have shown remarkable promise in treating tumours, including metastatic melanoma2-4. However, the patient response rate is low4,5. A better understanding of PD-L1-mediated immune evasion is needed to predict patient response and improve treatment efficacy. Here we report that metastatic melanomas release extracellular vesicles, mostly in the form of exosomes, that carry PD-L1 on their surface. Stimulation with interferon-γ (IFN-γ) increases the amount of PD-L1 on these vesicles, which suppresses the function of CD8 T cells and facilitates tumour growth. In patients with metastatic melanoma, the level of circulating exosomal PD-L1 positively correlates with that of IFN-γ, and varies during the course of anti-PD-1 therapy. The magnitudes of the increase in circulating exosomal PD-L1 during early stages of treatment, as an indicator of the adaptive response of the tumour cells to T cell reinvigoration, stratifies clinical responders from non-responders. Our study unveils a mechanism by which tumour cells systemically suppress the immune system, and provides a rationale for the application of exosomal PD-L1 as a predictor for anti-PD-1 therapy."

Changes in land use and land cover considerably alter the Earth’s energy balance and biogeochemical cycles, which contributes to climate change and—in turn—affects land surface properties and the provision of ecosystem services1–4. However, quantification of global land change is lacking. Here we analyse 35 years’ worth of satellite data and provide a comprehensive record of global land-change dynamics during the period 1982–2016. We show that—contrary to the prevailing view that forest area has declined globally5—tree cover has increased by 2.24 million km2 (+7.1% relative to the 1982 level). This overall net gain is the result of a net loss in the tropics being outweighed by a net gain in the extratropics. Global bare ground cover has decreased by 1.16 million km2 (−3.1%), most notably in agricultural regions in Asia. Of all land changes, 60% are associated with direct human activities and 40% with indirect drivers such as climate change. Land-use change exhibits regional dominance, including tropical deforestation and agricultural expansion, temperate reforestation or afforestation, cropland intensification and urbanization. Consistently across all climate domains, montane systems have gained tree cover and many arid and semi-arid ecosystems have lost vegetation cover. The mapped land changes and the driver attributions reflect a human-dominated Earth system. The dataset we developed may be used to improve the modelling of land-use changes, biogeochemical cycles and vegetation–climate interactions to advance our understanding of global environmental change1–4,6. Satellite data for the period 1982–2016 reveal changes in land use and land cover at global and regional scales that reflect patterns of land change indicative of a human-dominated Earth system."
https://openalex.org/W2886855629,"Human cancer cell lines are the workhorse of cancer research. Although cell lines are known to evolve in culture, the extent of the resultant genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity and its functional consequences remain understudied. Here we use genomic analyses of 106 human cell lines grown in two laboratories to show extensive clonal diversity. Further comprehensive genomic characterization of 27 strains of the common breast cancer cell line MCF7 uncovered rapid genetic diversification. Similar results were obtained with multiple strains of 13 additional cell lines. Notably, genetic changes were associated with differential activation of gene expression programs and marked differences in cell morphology and proliferation. Barcoding experiments showed that cell line evolution occurs as a result of positive clonal selection that is highly sensitive to culture conditions. Analyses of single-cell-derived clones demonstrated that continuous instability quickly translates into heterogeneity of the cell line. When the 27 MCF7 strains were tested against 321 anti-cancer compounds, we uncovered considerably different drug responses: at least 75% of compounds that strongly inhibited some strains were completely inactive in others. This study documents the extent, origins and consequences of genetic variation within cell lines, and provides a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research. The extent, origins and consequences of genetic variation within human cell lines are studied, providing a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W2782866351,"Topological insulators are an emerging class of materials that host highly robust in-gap surface or interface states while maintaining an insulating bulk1,2. Most advances in this field have focused on topological insulators and related topological crystalline insulators3 in two dimensions4–6 and three dimensions7–10, but more recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases in graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)11. The topological phase of these laterally confined, semiconducting strips of graphene is determined by their width, edge shape and terminating crystallographic unit cell and is characterized by a $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ invariant12 (that is, an index of either 0 or 1, indicating two topological classes—similar to quasi-one-dimensional solitonic systems13–16). Interfaces between topologically distinct GNRs characterized by different values of $${{\mathbb{Z}}}_{2}$$ are predicted to support half-filled, in-gap localized electronic states that could, in principle, be used as a tool for material engineering11. Here we present the rational design and experimental realization of a topologically engineered GNR superlattice that hosts a one-dimensional array of such states, thus generating otherwise inaccessible electronic structures. This strategy also enables new end states to be engineered directly into the termini of the one-dimensional GNR superlattice. Atomically precise topological GNR superlattices were synthesized from molecular precursors on a gold surface, Au(111), under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions and characterized by low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy. Our experimental results and first-principles calculations reveal that the frontier band structure (the bands bracketing filled and empty states) of these GNR superlattices is defined purely by the coupling between adjacent topological interface states. This manifestation of non-trivial one-dimensional topological phases presents a route to band engineering in one-dimensional materials based on precise control of their electronic topology, and is a promising platform for studies of one-dimensional quantum spin physics. A topologically engineered graphene nanoribbon superlattice is presented that hosts a one-dimensional array of half-filled, in-gap localized electronic states, enabling band engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2803605795,"Boundaries between distinct topological phases of matter support robust, yet exotic quantum states such as spin–momentum locked transport channels or Majorana fermions1–3. The idea of using such states in spintronic devices or as qubits in quantum information technology is a strong driver of current research in condensed matter physics4–6. The topological properties of quantum states have helped to explain the conductivity of doped trans-polyacetylene in terms of dispersionless soliton states7–9. In their seminal paper, Su, Schrieffer and Heeger (SSH) described these exotic quantum states using a one-dimensional tight-binding model10,11. Because the SSH model describes chiral topological insulators, charge fractionalization and spin–charge separation in one dimension, numerous efforts have been made to realize the SSH Hamiltonian in cold-atom, photonic and acoustic experimental configurations12–14. It is, however, desirable to rationally engineer topological electronic phases into stable and processable materials to exploit the corresponding quantum states. Here we present a flexible strategy based on atomically precise graphene nanoribbons to design robust nanomaterials exhibiting the valence electronic structures described by the SSH Hamiltonian15–17. We demonstrate the controlled periodic coupling of topological boundary states18 at junctions of graphene nanoribbons with armchair edges to create quasi-one-dimensional trivial and non-trivial electronic quantum phases. This strategy has the potential to tune the bandwidth of the topological electronic bands close to the energy scale of proximity-induced spin–orbit coupling19 or superconductivity20, and may allow the realization of Kitaev-like Hamiltonians3 and Majorana-type end states21. Graphene nanoribbons are used to design robust nanomaterials with controlled periodic coupling of topological boundary states to create quasi-one-dimensional trivial and non-trivial electronic quantum phases."

https://openalex.org/W2887399686,"Dysfunction in prosocial interactions is a core symptom of autism spectrum disorder. However, the neural mechanisms that underlie sociability are poorly understood, limiting the rational development of therapies to treat social deficits. Here we show in mice that bidirectional modulation of the release of serotonin (5-HT) from dorsal raphe neurons in the nucleus accumbens bidirectionally modifies sociability. In a mouse model of a common genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder—a copy number variation on chromosome 16p11.2—genetic deletion of the syntenic region from 5-HT neurons induces deficits in social behaviour and decreases dorsal raphe 5-HT neuronal activity. These sociability deficits can be rescued by optogenetic activation of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons, an effect requiring and mimicked by activation of 5-HT1b receptors in the nucleus accumbens. These results demonstrate an unexpected role for 5-HT action in the nucleus accumbens in social behaviours, and suggest that targeting this mechanism may prove therapeutically beneficial. Stimulating the release of serotonin (5-HT) in the nucleus accumbens in wild-type mice promotes sociability, and rescues deficits in social behaviours in a mouse model of autism."

The development and application of methods to prevent the inheritance of damaging mutations through the human germline could have significant health benefits, and currently include preimplantation genetic diagnosis and carrier screening. Ma et al. take this a step further by attempting to remove a disease mutation from the human germline through gene editing (1). They assert the following advances: (i) the correction of a pathogenic gene mutation responsible for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in human embryos using CRISPR-Cas9 and (ii) the avoidance of mosaicism in edited embryos. In the case of correction, the authors conclude that repair using the homologous chromosome was as or more frequent than mutagenic nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). Their conclusion is significant, if validated, because such a self-repair mechanism would allow gene correction without the introduction of a repair template. While the authors analyses relied on the failure to detect mutant alleles, here we suggest approaches to provide direct evidence for inter-homologue recombination and discuss other events consistent with the data. We also review the biological constraints on inter-homologue recombination in the early embryo. (1) Ma, H. et al. Correction of a pathogenic gene mutation in human embryos.

Although patients can benefit from enzalutamide at the beginning of this therapy, acquired enzalutamide resistance usually occurs within a short period. This motivated us to investigate the mechanism involved and possible approaches for overcoming enzalutamide resistance in CRPC. In the present study, we found that 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl–CoA reductase (HMGCR), a crucial enzyme in the mevalonate pathway for sterol biosynthesis, is elevated in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cell lines. HMGCR knockdown could resensitize these cells to the drug, and HMGCR overexpression conferred resistance to it, suggesting that aberrant HMGCR expression is an important enzalutamide-resistance mechanism in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells were more sensitive to statins, which are HMGCR inhibitors. Of note, a combination of simvastatin and enzalutamide significantly inhibited the growth of enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells in vitro and tumors in vivo. Mechanistically, simvastatin decreased protein levels of the androgen receptor (AR), which was further reduced in combination with enzalutamide. We observed that the decrease in AR may occur through simvastatin-mediated inhibition of the mTOR pathway, whose activation was associated with increased HMGCR and AR expression.

Consequently, androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) is currently the primary approach for the treatment of PCa. Although patients can benefit from ADT at the beginning of treatment, most of them will relapse with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which is currently incurable. Enzalutamide is a nonsteroidal second-generation antiandrogen that has recently been approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC both in the post-docetaxel and chemotherapy-naive settings. It can inhibit androgen binding to the androgen receptor (AR), AR translocation into the nucleus, AR binding to DNA, and coactivator recruitment (1Rodriguez-Vida A. Galazi M. Rudman S. Chowdhury S.

Although enzalutamide can work efficiently at the beginning of treatment, it is only valid for a specified period, after which acquired drug resistance usually occurs. Currently, it is reported that such resistance can be induced by AR splice variants (AR-Vs), AR mutation, autophagy, aberrant glucose metabolism, intracrine androgen biosynthesis, etc. (2Antonarakis E.S.

Men with a higher level of cholesterol are usually at greater risk of developing high-grade PCa. During cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl–CoA reductase (HMGCR) is the first rate-limiting enzyme, whose inhibition has been traditionally used to lower serum cholesterol as a means of reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease. Drugs that inhibit HMGCR, known collectively as statins, are generic drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In addition to statins' efficacy on treating cardiovascular disease, accumulating evidence suggests that statins also exert an antineoplastic effect in many types of cancer, including breast, prostate, ovarian, lymphoma, renal cell carcinoma, and colorectal cancer (11Zhong S. Zhang X. Chen L. Ma T. Tang J. Zhao J. Statin use and mortality in cancer patients: systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.Cancer Treat.

Further, it was reported that such down-regulated PSA levels might be caused by proteolysis of AR induced by statins (15Yokomizo A. Shiota M. Kashiwagi E. Kuroiwa K. Tatsugami K. Inokuchi J. Takeuchi A. Naito S. Statins reduce the androgen sensitivity and cell proliferation by decreasing the androgen receptor protein in prostate cancer cells.Prostate. 2011; 71 (10.1002/pros.21243 20717902): 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All these studies suggest that statins may suppress PCa progression through inhibiting AR. Therefore, we aim to test whether statins can overcome acquisition of enzalutamide resistance in CRPC, in which AR continues to play an important role. Herein, RNA-Seq analysis was performed in two PCa cells lines: LNCaP and MR49F, the enzalutamide-resistant derivative of LNCaP. We found that genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated in MR49F compared with those in LNCaP cells. Therefore, we hypothesize that cholesterol biosynthesis plays an essential role in the acquisition of enzalutamide resistance and that targeting HMGCR will overcome enzalutamide resistance in CRPC. To investigate molecular mechanisms underlying enzalutamide resistance, we performed RNA-Seq analysis with LNCaP and MR49F cells. Based on the RNA-Seq result, higher gene expression of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was observed in MR49F cells than that in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1A). Herein, HMGCR was selected for further study because it is the first rate-limiting protein that plays an important role in cholesterol biosynthesis. To validate the findings from our RNA-Seq analysis, a series of Western blotting analyses was performed in LNCaP, MR49F, C4-2, and C4-2R (an enzalutamide-resistant cell line derived from C4-2). As shown in Fig. 1 (B–D), C4-2R and MR49F showed higher expression levels of HMGCR than those of C4-2 and LNCaP. In addition, such a tendency became more significant when all cells were treated with enzalutamide for 4 h prior to harvest. Meanwhile, the protein level of SREBP2, another critical regulator of cholesterol synthesis, was also examined. Upon enzalutamide treatment, MR49F and C4-2R express higher levels of cleaved SREBP2, the active form of SREBP2, than those of LNCaP and C4-2, respectively (Fig. 1B). Next, we wanted to investigate whether there was more cholesterol synthesized in enzalutamide-resistant cell lines by directly measuring total cholesterol levels. As shown in Fig. 1 (E and F), both MR49F and C4-2R show much higher cholesterol levels than those of LNCaP and C4-2, respectively, upon enzalutamide treatment. Thus, cholesterol biosynthesis is indeed elevated by enzalutamide in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells, but not in enzalutamide-sensitive cells. Collectively, the data described above indicated that a high level of HMGCR activates cholesterol biosynthesis in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. To further validate this finding in clinic, we performed bioinformatics analysis with 72 patient specimens (described under “Experimental procedures”). Accordingly, we found that cholesterol biosynthesis pathway gene set was enriched in high HMGCR-expressing group, indicating that cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was activated as HMGCR expression was elevated (Fig. 1, G and H). Furthermore, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the HMGCR expression profile showed that the steroid biosynthesis pathway-related gene set is also positively enriched (Fig. 1, I and J). Having established that HMGCR is highly expressed in enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells, we asked whether alternation of HMGCR protein level could affect cellular response to enzalutamide. To explore this, shRNA was used to knock down HMGCR in C4-2R cells, and the down-regulation of HMGCR was determined by IB (Fig. 2A). Because of the relative lower KD efficacy of a single shRNA, a mixed pool of both shRNAs was used to construct stable HMGCR-KD cell line. Then the growth assay was performed to test whether HMGCR-KD cells were more sensitive to enzalutamide. After 3-day treatment of enzalutamide with different concentrations, C4-2R cells were still fairly resistant to enzalutamide, whereas down-regulation of HMGCR clearly rendered C4-2R cells more sensitive to enzalutamide (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, after HMGCR was restored in HMGCR-KD cells (Fig. 2C), it apparently rescued cells from enzalutamide-induced growth inhibition (Fig. 2D). In agreement, a similar observation was made in anchorage-independent growth assay (Fig. 2, E and F). Compared with control cells, which showed no significant difference in colony numbers after enzalutamide treatment (Fig. 2E), significantly fewer colonies were formed when HMGCR-KD cells were treated with enzalutamide (Fig. 2F), and the phenotype was largely reversed upon reintroduction of HMGCR (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, cell apoptosis was examined by IB against cleaved PARP. C4-2R cells are resistant to enzalutamide and showed almost no apoptosis upon enzalutamide treatment, whereas knockdown of HMGCR restored their sensitivity to enzalutamide (Fig. 2H). Further, we transiently transfected C4-2 cells with HMGCR and asked whether overexpression of HMGCR could confer C4-2 cells resistance to enzalutamide. After HMGCR protein overexpression was confirmed by IB, we performed a 3-day cell-growth assay under treatment of enzalutamide with the indicated concentrations. As indicated, more C4-2 cells overexpressing HMGCR could survive than C4-2 cells transfected with pcDNA3.0 (Fig. 2I). Collectively, these results demonstrate that down-regulation of HMGCR renders enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells to be sensitive to enzalutamide and that up-regulation of HMGCR can confer resistance. Because overexpression of HMGCR can confer PCa cells resistance to enzalutamide, we finally asked whether enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells are more sensitive to statins, which targets HMGCR. To test this, a 3-day growth assay under treatment of mevastatin with different concentrations was conducted. As expected, MR49F and C4-2R are more sensitive to mevastatin than their parental cell lines, respectively (Fig. 2, J and K), providing a possible new approach to overcome enzalutamide resistance. Next, we asked whether simvastatin, one of the marked statins, could enhance the inhibitory effect of enzalutamide on enzalutamide-resistant PCa cells. For that purpose, colony formation assay was performed with MR49F, C4-2R, and 22RV1 cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Significantly fewer colonies were observed in the combination groups in all three cell lines, suggesting that simvastatin enhances enzalutamide efficacy of these enzalutamide-resistant cell lines. To further validate this, we also performed proliferation assays in MR49F and C4-2R cells. As shown in Fig. 3 (D and E), simvastatin alone could slightly slow down cell growth, whereas a combination of enzalutamide and simvastatin significantly inhibited cell proliferation rate. Meanwhile, representative images of four treatment groups were taken on day 5 for C4-2R cells to compare potential morphology change of the cells. As shown in Fig. 3F, there was no apparent difference between control group and enzalutamide monotherapy group, but simvastatin alone was capable of inducing shrinkage of cells. For combination group, the same morphological modification was observed, and cells were clearly sparser. Next, the apoptosis level was tested after different treatments with indicated cell lines. 22RV1 or C4-2R cells were treated with simvastatin at the indicated concentrations in the presence or absence of enzalutamide and harvested for IB against cleaved PARP, a marker of apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 3 (G–I), enzalutamide alone could not induce any apoptosis because the cells used are enzalutamide-resistant. Although simvastatin treatment alone caused relatively weak cell death, the combination of two drugs clearly led to significantly higher levels of apoptosis. However, such a combinational effect on cell death was not observed in enzalutamide-sensitive LNCaP and C4-2 cells (Fig. 3J). To further confirm the combinatory effect between simvastatin and enzalutamide, the CI was measured. As shown in Table 1, the IC50 values for enzalutamide in C4-2R and MR49F cells are 57.6 and 20.0 μm, respectively. However, the IC50 values for enzalutamide in C4-2R and MR49F cells are reduced to 23.3 and 8.2 μm, respectively, when cells are treated with simvastatin, suggesting that simvastatin renders enzalutamide-resistant cells sensitive to enzalutamide. CIs of the two drugs in these two cell lines are 0.9 and 0.91, further indicating that statin and enzalutamide exert a synergistic effect in inhibiting cell growth.Table 1Combination index analysis of enzalutamide combined with simvastatinC4–2BRMR49FEnzalutamide (As)5057.6 μm20.0 μmSimvastatin (Bs)506.4 μm2.4 μmEnzalutamide (Am)50 (combined with half (Bs)50 simvastatin)23.3 μm8.2 μmCI0.90.91 Open table in a new tab To investigate whether statins can overcome enzalutamide resistance in vivo, we used the 22RV1 xenograft model. As shown in Fig. 4 (A–C), 22RV1-derived tumors showed strong resistance to enzalutamide, but simvastatin alone partially slowed down tumor growth, and a combination of simvastatin and enzalutamide almost completely inhibited tumor growth. At the same time, there was no significant difference in mice body weight among all groups (Fig. 4D), indicating that the combination treatment does not have serious side effects. Histologically, the cells in control and enzalutamide groups were arranged compactly but a little more discretely upon simvastatin treatment. In striking contrast, only small and scattered cell groups were found in combination treatment group (Fig. 4E). Furthermore, immunostaining of Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3 confirmed that the combination treatment indeed reduced tumor cell proliferation significantly and led to more apoptosis (Fig. 4, F–I). In summary, these in vivo results, which are consistent with our in vitro data, support the notion that the tumor-killing effect of enzalutamide was potentiated by statin. Because PCa progression is AR-dependent and enzalutamide resistance can be induced by reactivation of AR (16Claessens F. Helsen C. Prekovic S. Van den Broeck T. Spans L. Van Poppel H. Joniau S. Emerging mechanisms of enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer.Nat. Rev. Urol. 2014; 11 (10.1038/nrurol.2014.243 25224448): 712-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we asked whether AR signaling is affected by simvastatin. We found that simvastatin decreased AR protein level in a dose-dependent manner in C4-2R cells (Fig. 5A). To determine whether simvastatin can affect transcription levels of AR and even AR-V7, quantitative real-time PCR was performed. As shown in Fig. 5B, there was no significant difference in mRNA expression of AR or AR-V7 upon simvastatin treatment, suggesting that transcription of AR and AR-V7 is not affected by simvastatin. Next, cycloheximide (CHX), a protein translation inhibitor, was utilized to examine the effect of simvastatin on protein turnover of AR. Accordingly, after cycloheximide was added to the cells in the presence of different concentrations of simvastatin, C4-2R cells were harvested at different time points to follow AR degradation. As shown in Fig. 5C, simvastatin treatment clearly accelerated AR degradation compared with cells only treated with cycloheximide. Therefore, it is possible that simvastatin could induce AR degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system instead of down-regulating transcription. To confirm this hypothesis, the 26S proteasome inhibitor MG132 was used to ask whether it can reverse the simvastatin-induced AR degradation. As shown in Fig. 5D, MG132 treatment indeed partially rescued AR protein level from degradation induced by simvastatin. Having established that simvastatin can partially enhance AR protein degradation, we then asked whether a combinational treatment of enzalutamide and simvastatin would affect the AR protein level synergistically. To investigate this possibility, C4-2R, 22RV1, and MR49F cells were treated with enzalutamide, different concentrations of simvastatin, or various combinations of the two drugs and harvested. As shown in Fig. 6 (A–C), AR protein levels were decreased by simvastatin treatment alone in a dose-dependent manner. Further, simvastatin plus enzalutamide led to maximum inhibition of AR (Fig. 6, A–C) and even AR-Vs in 22RV1 cells (Fig. 6B). To further confirm this, immunofluorescence staining was conducted. As shown in Fig. 6D, enzalutamide alone did not alter the AR protein levels in C4-2R cells. Although simvastatin alone partially decreased AR level compared with that of the control group, simvastatin plus enzalutamide almost completely abolished AR signal. We further showed that the reduced AR level in the co-treatment group was not due to a reduced AR mRNA level (Fig. 6E) but due to a shortened protein half-life (Fig. 6F). In addition to these, we aimed to confirm that decreased AR protein level is indeed responsible for apoptosis induced by enzalutamide plus simvastatin. Toward that end, MR49F, C4-2R, and 22RV1 cells were overexpressed with AR, followed by co-treatment with enzalutamide and simvastatin for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 6G, less apoptosis was observed in cells overexpressing AR compared with control cells, indicating that overexpression of AR can protect enzalutamide-resistant cells from apoptosis caused by enzalutamide plus simvastatin. Finally, to test whether the effects seen above are specific to HMGCR, we examined AR protein expression in cells (control or HMGCR-KD) after enzalutamide treatment. As shown in Fig. 6 (H and I), AR level decreases partially in HMGCR-KD cells but more significantly upon enzalutamide treatment. In summary, our results demonstrate that degradation of AR is induced in PCa cells upon treatment with simvastatin alone or enzalutamide plus simvastatin and that AR degradation is the mechanism responsible for the synergistic effect of stain plus enzalutamide. The previous study in our lab showed that a positive feedback loop exists among mTOR pathway, AR signaling, and lipid biosynthesis pathway (17Zhang Z. Hou X. Shao C. Li J. Cheng J.X. Kuang S. Ahmad N. Ratliff T. Liu X. Plk1 inhibition enhances the efficacy of androgen signaling blockade in castration-resistant prostate cancer.Cancer Res. 2014; 74 (10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-1916 25252916): 6635-6647Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, we asked whether such an interaction is still active after antihormone therapy or even enzalutamide treatment. To explore this possibility, Pearson correlation analysis was performed to detect the gene expression interaction between HMGCR and mTOR, HMGCR, and AR, as well as AR and mTOR, by using the samples from 72 patients (described in the method). As shown in Fig. 7 (A–F), correlations of all three groups' gene expression were positive, but only the gene co-expression between AR and mTOR was significant with a correlation coefficient value of 0.4288 (Fig. 7C). Moreover, to explore whether mTOR pathway activation is associated with HMGCR and AR expression, GSEA analysis was performed with the same samples. As shown in Fig. 7 (G and H), mTOR pathway gene set was enriched in high HMGCR-expressing group, indicating that mTOR pathway is activated as HMGCR expression increases. Furthermore, GSEA analysis of AR expression profile showed that mTOR pathway-related gene set was positively enriched as well (Fig. 7, I and J). To validate the observation described above, additional experiments were performed by using of our cell models. As indicated, cleaved SREBP2, HMGCR, AR, and critical components of the mTOR pathway were all highly expressed in C4-2R cells compared with C4-2 cells (Fig. 7K). In addition, depletion of HMGCR led to down-regulation of levels of mTOR, phospho-mTOR, phospho-AKT and AR (Figs. 7L and 6I). Besides HMGCR expression level, we asked whether lower HMGCR activity could affect mTOR pathway as well. As shown in Fig. 7M, both the levels of phospho-AKT and phospho-S6 were decreased upon simvastatin treatment in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that simvastatin is capable of inhibiting mTOR pathway. Finally, inhibition of AKT with BKM120 induced an apparent degradation of AR in C4-2R cells upon enzalutamide treatment (Fig. 7N), which also explains why a combination of enzalutamide and simvastatin reduces AR synergistically. Enzalutamide has been recently approved as a drug for CRPC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and it significantly improves the therapy for late-stage CRPC patients (1Rodriguez-Vida A.

However, drug resistance usually occurs, and patients will relapse with CRPC, which is incurable. In this study, we have identified that HMGCR, a key enzyme for synthesis of cholesterol, is overexpressed in enzalutamide-resistant cell lines including MR49F and C4-2R, suggesting that abnormal cholesterol biosynthesis is likely to be one contributing factor for enzalutamide resistance. We further demonstrate that knockdown of HMGCR resensitize C4-2R to enzalutamide and that overexpression of HMGCR confers C4-2 to be more resistant to enzalutamide. Next, simvastatin, an inhibitor of HMGCR, was used to overcome enzalutamide resistance both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we show that simvastatin down-regulates protein level of AR by promoting its degradation and that a combination of simvastatin and enzalutamide exerts a synergistic effect on AR protein turnover, and this process may be through inhibition of mTOR pathway whose activation is found positively associated with HMGCR and AR expression. Increasing evidence shows that the lethal PCa is associated with deregulation of lipid or cholesterol biosynthesis (20Murtola T.J. Syvälä H. Pennanen P. Bläuer M. Solakivi T. Ylikomi T. Tammela T.L.

Disentangling the role of these various influences helps us understand the capacity of agriculture to adapt to change. Here we explore the impact of climate variability on rice yield and production in the Philippines from 1987–2016 in both irrigated and rainfed production systems at various scales. Over this period, rice production is affected by variations in soil moisture, which are largely driven by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). We found that the climate impacts on rice production are strongly seasonally modulated and differ considerably by region. As expected, rainfed upland rice production systems are more sensitive to soil moisture variability than irrigated paddy rice. About 10% of the variance in rice production anomalies on the national level co-varies with soil moisture changes, which in turn are strongly negatively correlated with an index capturing ENSO variability. Our results show that while temperature variability is of limited importance in the Philippines today, future climate projections suggest that by the end of the century, temperatures might regularly exceed known limits to rice production if warming continues unabated. Therefore, skillful seasonal prediction will likely become increasingly crucial to provide the necessary information to guide agriculture management to mitigate the compounding impacts of soil moisture variability and temperature stress. Detailed case studies like this complement global yield studies and provide important local perspectives that can help in food policy decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2885560747,"How do infants learn to mentally rotate objects, to imagine them rotating through different viewpoints? One possibility is that development of infants’ mental rotation (MR) is facilitated by visual and manual experience with complex objects. To evaluate this possibility, eighty 4-month-olds (40 females, 40 males) participated in an object exploration task with Velcro “sticky mittens” that allow infants too young to grasp objects themselves to nonetheless explore those objects manually as well as visually. These eighty infants also participated in a visual habituation task designed to test MR. Half the infants (Mittens First group) explored the object prior to the MR task, and the other half afterwards (Mittens Second group), to examine the role of immediate prior object experience on MR performance. We compared performance of male and female infants, but found little evidence for sex differences. However, we found an important effect of object exploration: The infants in the Mittens First group who exhibited the highest levels of spontaneous object engagement showed the strongest evidence of MR, but there were no consistent correlations between these measures for infants in the Mittens Second group. These findings suggest an important contribution from object experience to development of MR."

The as-spun PAN fibers were stabilized in air at 270°C for one hour and then carbonized at 750, 850, and 950°C in an inert atmosphere (argon) for another one hour. Differential scanning calorimetry and Raman spectroscopy were employed to determine the thermal and chemical properties of PAN. Surface features and morphologies of PAN-derived carbon nanofibers were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM). SEM micrograms showed that fiber diameters were reduced after carbonization due to evolution of toxic gases and dehydrogenation. The Raman spectra of carbonized fibers manifested D/G peaks. The Raman spectroscopy peaks of 1100 and 500 cm-1 manifested the formation of γ phase and another peak at 900 cm-1 manifested the formation of α-phase. The water contact angle measurement of carbonized PAN fibers indicated that the nanofibers were superhydrophobic (θ > 150o) due to the formation of bumpy and pitted surface after carbonization. In DSC experiment, the stabilized fibers showed a broad exothermic peak at 308°C due to cyclization process. The mechanical andThermal analysis was used to ascertain mechanical properties of carbonized PAN fibers. PAN-derived carbon nanofibers possess excellent physica and mechanical properties and therefore, they may be suitable for many industrial applications such as energy, biomedical, and aerospace."

https://openalex.org/W2887121067,"The main objective of this research was to determine the existence of relative age effect (RAE) in five European soccer leagues and their second-tier competitions. Even though RAE is a well-known phenomenon in professional sports environments it seems that the effect does not decline over the years. Moreover, additional information is required, especially when taking into account second-tier leagues. Birthdates from 1,332 first-tier domestic players from France, England, Spain, Germany and Italy and birthdates from 1,992 second-tier domestic players for the 2014/2015 season were taken for statistical analysis. In addition to standard statistical tests, the data were analyzed using econometric techniques for count data using Poisson and negative binomial regressions. The results obtained confirmed a biased distribution of birthdates in favor of players born earlier in the calendar year. For all of the five first-tier soccer leagues there was an unequal distribution of birthdates (France χ2 = 40.976, P<0.001; England χ2 = 21.892, P = 0.025; Spain χ2 = 24.690, P = 0.010; Germany χ2 = 22.889, P = 0.018; Italy χ2 = 28.583, P = 0.003). The results for second-tier leagues were similar (France χ2 = 46.741, P<0.001; England χ2 = 27.301, P = 0.004; Spain χ2 = 49.745, P<0.001; Germany χ2 = 30.633, P = 0.001; Italy χ2 = 36.973, P<0.001). Econometric techniques achieved similar results: estimated effect of month of birth, i.e., long-term RAE on players' representativeness, is negative (statistically significant at the 1% level). On average, one month closer to the end of the year reduces the logs of expected counts of players by 6.9%. Assuming this effect as linear, being born in the month immediately before the cut-off date (i.e., December/August), reduces the logs of expected counts of players by approximately 75.9%. Further, ID (index of discrimination, that is, the ratio between the expected counts of players born in the middle of the first and the twelfth month of the selection year) is 2.13 and 2.22 for the first- and second-tier, respectively. In other words, in the top five European first-tier and second-tier leagues, one should expect the number of players born in the first month of the calendar year to be twice the number of those born in the last month. The RAE in the second-tiers is the same as in the first-tiers, so it appears that there is no second chance for later born players. This reduces the chances to recover talented players discarded in youth simply because of lower maturity."
https://openalex.org/W2886827422,"Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) are a standard feature of ocean-going vessels, designed to allow vessels to notify each other of their position and route, to reduce collisions. Increasingly, the system is being used to monitor vessels remotely, particularly with the advent of satellite receivers. One fundamental problem with AIS transmission is the issue of gaps in transmissions. Gaps occur for three basic reasons: 1) saturation of the system in locations with high vessel density; 2) poor quality transmissions due to equipment on the vessel or receiver; and 3) intentional disabling of AIS transmitters. Resolving which of these mechanisms is responsible for generating gaps in transmissions from a given vessel is a critical task in using AIS to remotely monitor vessels. Moreover, separating saturation and equipment issues from intentional disabling is a key issue, as intentional disabling is a useful risk factor in predicting illicit behaviors such as illegal fishing. We describe a spatial statistical model developed to identify gaps in AIS transmission, which allows calculation of the probability that a given gap is due to intentional disabling. The model we developed successfully identifies high risk gaps in the test case example in the Arafura Sea. Simulations support that the model is sensitive to frequent gaps as short as one hour. Results in this case study area indicate expected high risk vessels were ranked highly for risk of intentional disabling of AIS transmitters. We discuss our findings in the context of improving enforcement opportunities to reduce illicit activities at sea."

While whole exome sequencing is increasingly applied, we questioned whether analyzing a partial exome, enriched for genes associated with Mendelian disorders, might be a valid alternative approach that yields similar detection rates but requires less sequencing capacities. Within this context 106 patients with different intellectual disability forms were analyzed for mutations in 4.813 genes after pre-exclusion of copy number variations by array-CGH. Subsequent variant interpretation was performed in accordance with the ACMG guidelines. By this, a molecular diagnosis was established in 34% of cases and candidate mutations were identified in additional 24% of patients. Detection rates of causative mutations were above 30%, regardless of further symptoms, except for patients with seizures (23%). We did not detect an advantage from partial exome sequencing for patients with severe intellectual disability (36%) as compared to those with mild intellectual disability (44%). Specific clinical diagnoses pre-existed for 20 patients. Of these, 5 could be confirmed and an additional 6 cases could be solved, but showed mutations in other genes than initially suspected. In conclusion partial exome sequencing solved >30% of intellectual disability cases, which is similar to published rates obtained by whole exome sequencing. The approach therefore proved to be a valid alternative to whole exome sequencing for molecular diagnostics in this cohort. The method proved equally suitable for both syndromic and non-syndromic intellectual disability forms of all severity grades."

Therefore, use of clinical and histopathological parameters in combination would be important to improve patient management. The main objective is to develop a model that predicts the presence of nodal metastasis in patients with OSCC.623 patients faced neck dissections with buccal mucosal or tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) were selected from patients’ records. Demographic data, clinical information, nodal status, Depth of invasion (DOI) and pattern of invasion (POI) were recorded. The parameters which showed a significant association with nodal metastasis were used to develop a multivariable predictive model (PM). Univariate logistic regression was used to estimate the strengths of those associations in terms of odds ratios (OR). This showed statistically significant associations between status of the nodal metastasis and each of the following 4 histopathological parameters individually: size of the tumour (T), site, POI, and DOI. Specifically, OR of nodal metastasis for tongue cancers relative to buccal mucosal cancers was 1.89, P-value < 0.001. Similarly, ORs for POI type 3 and 4 relative to type 2 were 1.99 and 5.83 respectively. A similar relationship was found with tumour size; ORs for T2, T3, and T4 compared to T1 were 2.79, 8.27 and 8.75 respectively. These four histopathological parameters were then used to develop a predictive model for nodal metastasis. This model showed that probability of nodal metastasis is higher among tongue cancers with increasing POI, with increasing T, and with larger depths while other characteristics remained unchanged. The proposed model provides a way of using combinations of histopathological parameters to identify patients with higher risks of nodal metastasis for surgical management."

The goal of our study was to analyze HGS of students based on chronological and biological age and propose normative standards for children and adolescents from Chile. Methods We studied 4604 school children of both sexes between the ages of 6.0 and 17.9 years of age. Weight, standing height, sitting height, and hand grip strength (HGS- right and left) were measured. The Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated, and the biological age was calculated by using age at peak height velocity (APHV). Results When arranged by chronological age, no significant differences occurred in HGS between both sexes of school children from age 6 to 12 years of age. However, from ages 13 to 17, males showed greater HGS than females. Significant differences also emerged between both sexes and at all levels for biological age (APHV). For males, chronological age explained the HGS occurring between 0.74 to 0.75% and for females between 0.54 to 0.59%. For males, biological age explained the HGS for the range of 0.79 to 0.80% and 0.62 to 0.67% for females. The normative data for HGS for both sexes is expressed in percentiles. Conclusions HGS during childhood and adolescence needs be analyzed and interpreted in terms of biological age rather than chronological age. The normative data to evaluate the HGS are a tool that can help professionals working in clinical and epidemiological contexts."

By means of culture-dependent methods, we isolated an indigenous yeast strain, KS5 (Rhodosporidium toruloides), directly from the flooding water of a former uranium mining site and investigated its interactions with uranium. Our results highlight distinct adaptive mechanisms towards high uranium concentrations on the one hand, and complex interaction mechanisms on the other. The cells of the strain KS5 exhibit high a uranium tolerance, being able to grow at 6 mM, and also a high ability to accumulate this radionuclide (350 mg uranium/g dry biomass, 48 h). The removal of uranium by KS5 displays a temperature- and cell viability-dependent process, indicating that metabolic activity could be involved. By STEM (scanning transmission electron microscopy) investigations, we observed that uranium was removed by two mechanisms, active bioaccumulation and inactive biosorption.

https://openalex.org/W2887353893,"The ploidy cycle, which is integral to sexual reproduction, requires meiosis to halve chromosome numbers as well as mechanisms that ensure zygotes are formed by exactly two partners1-4. During sexual reproduction of the fungal model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe, haploid P and M cells fuse to form a diploid zygote that immediately enters meiosis5. Here we reveal that rapid post-fusion reconstitution of a bipartite transcription factor blocks re-fertilization. We first identify mutants that undergo transient cell fusion involving cytosol exchange but not karyogamy, and show that this drives distinct cell fates in the two gametes. The P partner undergoes lethal haploid meiosis, whereas the M cell persists in mating. The zygotic transcription that drives meiosis is rapidly initiated first from the P parental genome, even in wild-type cells. This asymmetric gene expression depends on a bipartite complex formed post-fusion between the cytosolic M-cell-specific peptide Mi and the nuclear P-cell-specific homeobox protein Pi6,7, which captures Mi in the P nucleus. Zygotic transcription is thus poised to initiate in the P nucleus as fast as Mi reaches it after fusion, a design that we reconstruct using two synthetic interactors localized to the nucleus and the cytosol of two respective partner cells. Notably, delaying zygotic transcription-by postponing Mi expression or deleting its transcriptional target in the P genome-leads to zygotes fusing with additional gametes, thus forming polyploids and eventually aneuploid progeny. The signalling cascade to block re-fertilization shares components with, but bifurcates from, meiotic induction8-10. Thus, a cytoplasmic connection upon gamete fusion leads to asymmetric reconstitution of a bipartite transcription factor to rapidly block re-fertilization and induce meiosis, ensuring genome maintenance during sexual reproduction."

This shared susceptibility locus implicates complement deregulation as a common disease mechanism, and suggests the possibility that microbial interactions with host complement may trigger AMD. In this study, we address this possibility by testing the hypothesis that AMD is associated with specific microbial colonization of the human nasopharynx. Results High-throughput Illumina sequencing of the V3-V6 region of the microbial 16S ribosomal RNA gene was used to comprehensively and accurately describe the human pharyngeal microbiome, at genus level, in 245 AMD patients and 386 controls. Based on mean and differential microbial abundance analyses, we determined an overview of the pharyngeal microbiota, as well as candidate genera (Prevotella and Gemella) suggesting an association towards AMD health and disease conditions. Conclusions Utilizing an extensive study population from Singapore, our results provided an accurate description of the pharyngeal microbiota profiles in AMD health and disease conditions. Through identification of candidate genera that are different between conditions, we provide preliminary evidence for the existence of microbial triggers for AMD. Ethical approval for this study was obtained through the Singapore Health Clinical Institutional Review Board, reference numbers R799/63/2010 and 2010/585/A."
https://openalex.org/W2887248800,"Aims We estimate the pure effect of ageing on total health and aged care expenditure in Australia in the next 20 years. Methods We use a simple demographic projection model for the number of people in older age groups along with a needs based estimate of changes in the public and private cost of care per person in each group adjusted for expected changes in morbidity. Results A pure ageing model of expenditure growth predicts an increase in health expenditure per elderly person from $7439 in 2015 to $9594 in 2035 and an increase in total expenditure from $166 billion to $320 billion (an average annual growth of 3.33%). If people live longer without additional morbidity, then total health expenditure only grows at an average annual rate of 0.48%. If only some of those additional years are in good health, then the average year on year growth is 1.87%. Conclusion Ageing will have a direct effect on the growth of health spending but is likely to be dwarfed by other demand and supply factors. A focus on greater efficiency in health production and finance is likely to be more effective in delivering high quality care than trying to restrain the demand for health and aged care among the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2885538634,"Huanglongbing (HLB) is the most serious disease affecting citrus production worldwide. No HLB-resistant citrus varieties exist. The HLB pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus is nonculturable, increasing the difficulty of preventing and curing the disease. We successfully screened the biocontrol agent Bacillus GJ1 for the control of HLB in nursery-grown citrus plants. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of the transcriptome and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification of the proteome revealed differences in the detoxification responses of Bacillus GJ1-treated and -untreated Ca. L. asiaticus-infected citrus. Phylogenetic tree alignment showed that GJ1 was classified as B. amyloliquefaciens. The effect of eliminating the HLB pathogen was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and PCR. The results indicate that the rate of detoxification reached 50% after seven irrigations, of plants with an OD600nm≈1 Bacillus GJ1 suspension. Most importantly, photosynthesis-antenna proteins, photosynthesis, plant-pathogen interactions, and protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum were significantly upregulated (padj < 0.05), as shown by the KEGG enrichment analysis of the transcriptomes; nine of the upregulated genes were validated by qPCR. Transcription factor analysis of the transcriptomes was performed, and 10 TFs were validated by qPCR. Cyanoamino acid metabolism, regulation of autophagy, isoflavonoid biosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, protein export, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism, and carotenoid biosynthesis were investigated by KEGG enrichment analysis of the proteome, and significant differences were found in the expression of the genes involved in those pathways. Correlation analysis of the proteome and transcriptome showed common entries for the significantly different expression of proteins and the significantly different expression of genes in the GO and KEGG pathways, respectively. The above results reveal important information about the detoxification pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2885481970,"There is a globally increasing prevalence and incidence of diabetes mellitus (DM). Prolonged hyperglycaemia could lead to both macrovascular damage, such as carotid artery atherosclerosis, and microvascular damage, such as retinal arteriolar narrowing, and might contribute to retinal artery occlusion (RAO). Accordingly, it is important to determine whether DM is a contrubuting factor of RAO. We conducted a retrospective cohort study that included 241,196 DM patients from the Longitudinal Cohort of Diabetes Patients Database who were recruited between 2003 and 2005. An age- and sex-matched non-DM control group included the same number of patients who were selected from the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database of 2000. Relevant data of each patient were collected from the index date until December 2013. The incidence and risk of RAO were calculated and compared between the DM and non-DM groups. The hazard ratio for RAO was calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis after adjusting for confounders. The cumulative incidence rate of RAO was calculated by Kaplan–Meier analysis. In total, 317 patients with DM and 144 controls developed RAO during the follow-up period, leading to an incidence rate of RAO in DM patients that was 2.30 times (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.89–2.80) greater than that in controls. After adjustment for potential confounders, patients with DM were 2.11 times (95% CI, 1.71–2.59) more likely to develop RAO in the total study cohort. In conclusion, DM increases the risk of RAO, which is an interdisciplinary emergency. Close collaboration between endocrinologists and ophthalmologists is important in managing RAO following DM."

https://openalex.org/W2885901112,"Avian trichomonosis is a widespread disease in columbids and other birds, caused by ingestion of the unicellular flagellate Trichomonas gallinae which proliferate primarily in the upper respiratory tracts. Studies using genetic analyses have determined some highly pathogenic lineages in birds, but the prevalence and distribution of potentially pathogenic and non-pathogenic T. gallinae lineages in wild birds is still not well known. We examined 440 oral swab samples of 35 bird species collected between 2015 and 2017 in Hesse, central Germany, for Trichomonas spp. infection and for determining the genetic lineages. Of these birds, 152 individuals were caught in the wild and 288 individuals were admitted from the wild to a veterinary clinic. The overall Trichomonas spp. prevalence was 35.6%. We observed significant differences between bird orders, with the highest prevalence in owls (58%) and columbids (50%), while other orders had slightly lower prevalences, with 36% in Accipitriformes, 28% in Falconiformes and 28% in Passeriformes. Among 71 successfully sequenced samples, we found 13 different haplotypes, including two previously described common lineages A/B (20 samples) and C/V/N (36 samples). The lineage A/B has been described as pathogenic, causing lesions and mortality in columbids, raptors and finches. This lineage was found in 11 of the 35 species, including columbids (feral pigeon, woodpigeon, stock dove), passerines (greenfinch, chaffinch, blackbird) and raptors (common kestrel, sparrowhawk, red kite, peregrine falcon and common buzzard). One new lineage (R) was found in a sample of a chaffinch. In conclusion, we found that the prevalence of Trichomonas spp. infection in wild birds was high overall, and the potentially pathogenic lineage A/B was widespread. Our findings are worrying, as epidemic outbreaks of trichomonosis have already been observed in Germany in several years and can have severe negative effects on bird populations. This disease may add to the multiple pressures that birds face in areas under high land-use intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2887669473,"A patient-derived xenograft (PDX) approach, which relies on direct transplantation of tumor specimens into an immunocompromised animal, is a commonly used method for investigating tumor therapy predictions in vivo. This study evaluated influencing factors, including clinical, oncological, and genetic variables, for a pancreatic PDX model in mice. Tumor specimens were obtained from 121 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection at the Changhai Pancreatic Surgery Medical Center (Shanghai, China) between April 2016 and February 2017. Pancreatic cancer (PC) samples <3 mm3 were subcutaneously implanted into the NOD/Shi-scid/IL-2Rγnull (NSG) mice. Once the xenograft reached 300–500 mm3 or reached 180 d after cell inoculation, the tumor was excised. Part of the tumor was subsequently transplanted to next-generation mice, and another part was analyzed by using immunohistochemistry. Among the 121 patients with PC, tumor xenograft was successfully generated in 86 patients (71.1%). Primary tumor >3.5 cm in size was independently associated with xenograft formation rate. In addition, several enriched mutated genes within the VEGF pathway and higher microvessel density were found in the positive group (with xenograft) compared with the negative group (without xenograft). We concluded that tumor size and mutated VEGF pathway in PC are important factors affecting PDX model construction with NSG mice.—Guo, S., Gao, S., Liu, R., Shen, J., Shi, X., Bai, S., Wang, H., Zheng, K., Shao, Z., Liang, C., Peng, S., Jin, G.

https://openalex.org/W2886818149,"Background Developing countries and Indigenous populations are disproportionately affected by global trends in diabetes (T2DM), but inconsistent data are available to corroborate this pattern in Guatemala and indigenous communities in Central America. Historic estimates of T2DM, using a variety of sampling techniques and diagnostic methods, in Guatemala include a T2DM prevalence of: 4·2% (1970) and 8·4% (2003). Objectives of this geographically randomized, cross-sectional analysis of risk include: (1) use HbA1c to determine prevalence of T2DM and prediabetes in rural Indigenous community of Atitlán (2) identify risk factors for T2DM including age, BMI and gender. Methods A spatially random sampling method was used to identify 400 subjects. Prevalence was compared using the confidence interval method, and logistic regression and linear regression were used to assess association between diabetes and risk factors. Findings The overall prevalence of T2DM using HbA1c was 13·81% and prediabetes was also 13·81% in Atitlán, representing a tripling in diabetes from historic estimates and a large population with pre-diabetes. The probability of diabetes increased dramatically with increasing age, however no significant overall relationship existed with gender or BMI. Conclusions Diabetes is a larger epidemic than previously expected and appears to be related to ageing rather than BMI. Our proposed explanations for these findings include: possible Indigenous unique genetic susceptibility to T2DM, shortcomings in BMI as a metric for adiposity in assessing risk, changes in lifestyle and diet, and an overall aging population. The conclusion of this study suggest that (1) T2DM in rural regions of Guatemala may be of epidemic proportion. With pre-diabetes, more than 25% of the population will be diabetic in the very near future; (2) Age is a significant risk factor in the Indigenous population but BMI is not. This suggests that in some populations diabetes may be a disease of ageing."
https://openalex.org/W2887304665,"Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) is an ubiquitous basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which is ligand-activated and involved in numerous biological processes including cell division, cell quiescence and inflammation. It has been shown that AHR is involved in normal hematopoietic progenitor proliferation in human cells. In addition, loss of AHR in knockout mice is accompanied by a myeloproliferative syndrome-like disease, suggesting a role of AHR in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. To study the potential role of AHR pathway in CML progenitors and stem cells, we have first evaluated the expression of AHR in UT-7 cell line expressing BCR-ABL. AHR expression was highly reduced in UT-7 cell expressing BCR-ABL as compared to controls. AHR transcript levels, quantified in primary peripheral blood CML cells at diagnosis (n = 31 patients) were found to be significantly reduced compared to healthy controls (n = 15). The use of StemRegenin (SR1), an AHR antagonist, induced a marked expansion of total leukemic cells and leukemic CD34+ cells by about 4- and 10-fold respectively. SR1-treated CML CD34+ cells generated more colony-forming cells and long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC)–derived progenitors as compared to non-SR1-treated counterparts. Conversely, treatment of CML CD34+ cells with FICZ, a natural agonist of AHR, induced a 3-fold decrease in the number of CD34+ cells in culture after 7 days. Moreover, a 4-day FICZ treatment was sufficient to significantly reduce the clonogenic potential of CML CD34+ cells and this effect was synergized by Imatinib and Dasatinib treatments. Similarly, a 3-day FICZ treatment contributed to hinder significantly the number of LTC-IC-derived progenitors without synergistic effect with Imatinib. The analysis of molecular circuitry of AHR signaling in CML showed a transcriptional signature in CML derived CD34+ CD38- primitive cells with either low or high levels of AHR, with an upregulation of myeloid genes involved in differentiation in the “AHR low” fraction and an upregulation of genes involved in stem cell maintenance in the “AHR high” fraction. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate for the first time that down-regulation of AHR expression, a major cell cycle regulator, is involved in the myeloproliferative phenotype associated with CML. AHR agonists inhibit clonogenic and LTC-IC-derived progenitor growth and they could be used in leukemic stem cell targeting in CML."

We present clinical data concerning a newly developed measure of cognitive flexibility, administered by means of Eye-Tracking (ET) technology in order to bypass verbal-motor limitations.21 ALS patients and 21 age-and education-matched healthy subjects participated in an ET-based cognitive assessment, including a newly developed test of cognitive flexibility (Arrows and Colors Cognitive Test-ACCT) and other oculomotor-driven measures of cognitive functions. A standard screening of frontal and working memory abilities and global cognitive efficiency was administered to all subjects, in addition to a psychological self-rated assessment. For ALS patients, a clinical examination was also performed.ACCT successfully discriminated between patients and healthy controls, mainly concerning execution times obtained at different subtests. A qualitative analysis performed on error distributions in patients highlighted a lower prevalence of perseverative errors, with respect to other type of errors. Correlations between ACCT and other ET-based frontal-executive measures were significant and involved different frontal sub-domains. Limited correlations were observed between ACCT and standard 'paper and pencil' cognitive tests.The newly developed ET-based measure of cognitive flexibility could be a useful tool to detect slight frontal impairments in non-demented ALS patients by bypassing verbal-motor limitations through the oculomotor-driven administration. The findings reported in the present study represent the first contribution towards the development of a full verbal-motor free executive test for ALS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2885936675,"Probably one of the most controversial questions about the cell division of Bacillus subtilis, a rod-shaped bacterium, concerns the mechanism that ensures correct division septum placement-at mid-cell during vegetative growth but closer to one end during sporulation. In general, bacteria multiply by binary fission, in which the division septum forms almost exactly at the cell centre. How the division machinery achieves such accuracy is a question of continuing interest. We understand in some detail how this is achieved during vegetative growth in Escherichia coli and B. subtilis, where two main negative regulators, nucleoid occlusion and the Min system, help to determine the division site, but we still do not know exactly how the asymmetric septation site is determined during sporulation in B. subtilis. Clearly, the inhibitory effects of the nucleoid occlusion and Min system on polar division have to be overcome. We evaluated the positioning of the asymmetric septum and its accuracy by statistical analysis of the site of septation. We also clarified the role of SpoIIE, RefZ and MinCD on the accuracy of this process. We determined that the sporulation septum forms approximately 1/6 of a cell length from one of the cell poles with high precision and that SpoIIE, RefZ and MinCD have a crucial role in precisely localizing the sporulation septum. Our results strongly support the idea that asymmetric septum formation is a very precise and highly controlled process regulated by a still unknown mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2885826637,"In modern multi-cultural societies, conversations between foreign speakers and native listeners have become very common. These exchanges often include the use of figurative language. The present study examines, for the first time, whether native listeners’ non-literal interpretation of discourse is influenced by indexical cues such as speaker accent. Native listeners were presented with ironic and literal Spanish stories uttered in a native or foreign accent (Spanish and British English accents, respectively). Two types of irony were considered: ironic criticism (frequently used) and ironic praise (less frequently used). Participants were asked to rate stories on their level of irony. Results showed an impact of foreign accent on natives’ non-literal interpretation. The effect was evident in the less frequent ironic constructions (ironic praise), with foreign accented utterances considered less ironic than native accented utterances. These findings revealed that native listeners’ figurative interpretation of ironic praise can change depending on indexical cues, with a reduction of pragmatic inferences in the case of foreign accent."
https://openalex.org/W2886192878,"Staphylococcus aureus has developed resistance towards the most commonly used anti-staphylococcal antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find new treatment opportunities. A new approach relies on the use of helper compounds, which are able to potentiate the effect of antibiotics. A well-studied helper compound is thioridazine, which potentiates the effect of the β-lactam antibiotic dicloxacillin against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In order to identify thioridazine’s mechanism of action and how it potentiates the effect of dicloxacillin, we generated thioridazine resistant strains of MRSA USA300 by serial passage experiments. Selected strains were whole-genome sequenced to find mutations causing thioridazine resistance. Genes observed to be mutated were attempted deleted in MRSA USA300. The cls gene encoding a cardiolipin synthase important for synthesis of the membrane lipid cardiolipin was found to be mutated in thioridazine resistant strains. Deletion of this gene resulted in a two-fold increased Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value for thioridazine compared to the wild type and decreased susceptibility similar to the thioridazine resistant strains. Since cardiolipin likely plays a role in resistance towards thioridazine, it might also be important for the mechanism of action behind the potentiating effect of thioridazine. TDZ is known to intercalate into the membrane and we show here that TDZ can depolarize the plasma membrane. However, our results indicate that the membrane potential reducing effect of TDZ is independent of the resistance mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2886582190,"Drosophila suzukii or spotted wing Drosophila is an economically important pest which can have a devastating impact on soft and stone fruit industries. Biological pesticides are being sought as alternatives to synthetic chemicals to control this invasive pest, but many are subject to degradation either in the environment or in the insect gut and as a result require protection. In this study we identified a sharp change in pH of the adult midgut from neutral to acidic (pH <3), which we then exploited to develop poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP) microcapsules that respond to the change in midgut pH by dissolution and release of their cargo for uptake into the insect. First, we used labelled solid poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) particles to show that microcapsules with a diameter less than 15 μm are readily ingested by the adult insect. To encapsulate water-soluble biological species in an aqueous continuous phase, a multiple emulsion template was used as a precursor for the synthesis of pH-responsive P2VP microcapsules with a fluorescent (FITC-dextran) cargo. The water-soluble agent was initially separated from the aqueous continuous phase by an oil barrier, which was subsequently polymerised. The P2VP microcapsules were stable at pH > 6, but underwent rapid dissolution at pH < 4.2. In vivo studies showed that the natural acidity of the midgut of D. suzukii also induced the breakdown of the responsive P2VP microcapsules to release FITC-dextran which was taken up into the body of the insect and accumulated in the renal tubules."

In contrast, most other mammals have only one IgA, or in the case of hominoids, two IgA subclasses. Characteristic features of the mammalian IgA subclasses are the length and amino acid sequence of their hinge regions, which are often rich in Pro, Ser and Thr residues and may also carry Cys residues. Here, we describe a new IgA that was expressed in New Zealand White domestic rabbits of IGHVa1 allotype. This IgA has an extended hinge region containing an intriguing stretch of nine consecutive Ser residues and no Pro or Thr residues, a motif exclusive to this new rabbit IgA. Considering the amino acid properties, this hinge motif may present some advantage over the common IgA hinge by affording novel functional capabilities. We also sequenced for the first time the IgA14 CH2 and CH3 domains and showed that IgA14 and IgA3 are expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2885422777,"Objective Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), a chronic pain condition, develops mainly after limb trauma and severely inhibits function. While early diagnosis is essential, factors for CRPS onset are elusive. Therefore, identifying those at risk is crucial. Sensory modulation dysfunction (SMD), affects the capacity to regulate responses to sensory input in a graded and adaptive manner and was found associated with hyperalgesia in otherwise healthy individuals, suggestive of altered pain processing. Aim To test SMD as a potential risk factor for CRPS. Methods In this cross-sectional study, forty-four individuals with CRPS (29.9±11 years, 27 men) and 204 healthy controls (27.4±3.7 years, 105 men) completed the Sensory Responsiveness Questionnaire-Intensity Scale (SRQ-IS). A physician conducted the CRPS Severity Score (CSS), testing individuals with CRPS. Results Thirty-four percent of the individuals with CRPS and twelve percent of the healthy individuals were identified to have SMD (χ2 (1) = 11.95; p<0.001). Logistic regression modeling revealed that the risk of CRPS is 2.68 and 8.21 times higher in individuals with sensory over- and sensory under-responsiveness, respectively, compared to non-SMD individuals (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). Conclusions SMD, particularly sensory under-responsiveness, might serve as a potential risk factor for CRPS and therefore screening for SMD is recommended. This study provides the risk index probability clinical tool a simple evaluation to be applied by clinicians in order to identify those at risk for CRPS immediately after injury.

In this study, to assess the expression status and prognostic significance of the STAT3 pathway in upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC), we immunohistochemically stained for STAT3 and STAT3 pathway proteins, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), in a tissue microarray containing 99 UTUC specimens. There were no significant associations between STAT3, S1PR1, or IL-6 expression pattern and tumor grade or pT stage. However, the patients with high STAT3 tumor had a significantly higher risk of both disease progression (p = 0.009) and cancer-specific mortality (p = 0.009), but not with tumors expressing S1PR1 or IL-6. High STAT3 expression in the nucleus was also associated with a significantly higher risk of both disease progression (p = 0.003) and cancer-specific mortality (p = 0.034). Multivariate analysis revealed that high STAT3 expression in the nucleus was significantly associated with cancer-specific survival after adjustment for pathological stage, lymph node involvement, lymphovascular invasion, and tumor grade (HR = 2.136, 95% CI = 1.009-4.767, p = 0.047).

https://openalex.org/W2887165346,"We discuss an effective time-dependent THz spectroscopy method for the detection and identification of a substance with an inhomogeneous surface using a broadband THz signal reflected from the substance. We show that a successful and reliable identification can be made using the single long-duration THz signal, which contains not only the main reflected pulse, but also several sub-pulses. The method does not use averaging of the measured THz signals over the viewing angles and scanning over the surface area, which significantly increases the signal processing speed. The identification is based on the method of spectral dynamics analysis together with the integral correlation criteria (ICC). We compare the absorption spectral dynamics of a substance under analysis with the corresponding dynamics for a standard substance from database. For reliable and effective substance detection, we propose to use several ICC simultaneously in different time intervals, which contain not only the main pulse of the reflected THz signal, but also the sub-pulses. This way, one can detect and identify the substance in the sample with high probability. As examples of identification, we used the THz signals reflected from the plastic explosive PWM C4 with both rough and concave surface. We show that the main pulse, reflected from the inhomogeneous surface of the sample, contains information about its absorption frequencies."

Several incidents involving contamination of residences and buildings due to ricin production or dissemination have occurred in recent years. The goal of this study was to determine whether ricin bioactivity could be attenuated in reasonable time via simple modifications of the indoor environment. Attenuation was assessed on six different materials as a function of temperature, relative humidity (RH), and contact time, using both a pure and crude preparation of the toxin. Ricin bioactivity was quantified via a cytotoxicity assay, and attenuation determined as the difference in ricin recovered from test and positive controls. The results showed that pure ricin could be attenuated successfully, while the crude ricin was generally more persistent and results more variable. We found no significant attenuation in crude ricin after two weeks at typical indoor environmental conditions, except on steel. Attenuation mostly improved with increasing temperature, but the effect of RH varied. For pure ricin, heat treatments at 40°C for 5 days or 50°C for 2-3 days achieved greater than 96% attenuation on steel. In contrast, appreciable recovery of the crude ricin preparation still occurred at 40°C after two weeks."
https://openalex.org/W2886382020,"We previously used whole-genome sequencing and Tn5 transposon mutagenesis to identify 16 critical genes involved in the halotolerance of Halomonas beimenensis, a species in the phylum Proteobacteria. In this present study, we sought to determine if orthologous genes in another phylum are also critical for halotolerance. Virgibacillus spp. are halotolerant species that can survive in high-saline environments. Some Virgibacillus species are used in different aspects of food processing, compatible solute synthesis, proteinase production, and wastewater treatment. However, genomic information on Virgibacillus chiguensis is incomplete. We assembled a draft V. chiguensis strain NTU-102 genome based on high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) and used transcriptomic profiling to examine the high-saline response in V. chiguensis. The V. chiguensis draft genome is approximately 4.09 Mbp long and contains 4,166 genes. The expression profiles of bacteria grown in 5% and 20% NaCl conditions and the corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) and clusters of orthologous groups (COG) categories were also analyzed in this study. We compared the expression levels of these 16 orthologs of halotolerance-related genes in V. chiguensis and H. beimenensis. Interestingly, the expression of 7 of the 16 genes, including trkA2, smpB, nadA, mtnN2, rfbP, lon, and atpC, was consistent with that in H. beimenensis, suggesting that these genes have conserved functions in different phyla. The omics data were helpful in exploring the mechanism of saline adaptation in V. chiguensis, and our results indicate that these 7 orthologs may serve as biomarkers for future screening of halotolerant species in the future."

Such material is essential for studying perceptual processes and behaviors of exposed individuals, and it could find practical applications, such as the improvement of communication strategies during crises. We present the Natural Disasters Picture System (NDPS), a database of pictures of natural hazards, with an emphasis on volcanic threats, and their impact on the environment and humans. We first describe in detail the picture selection and database creation. We then report the validation procedure. One hundred twenty participants rated the pictures on the basis of four dimensions: valence, arousal, dominance and certainty. For each picture, we ultimately determined the best-fitting emotion on the basis of its dimensional pattern. The Hierarchical Ascendant Classification, which yielded 4 clusters subdivided into 9 classes, indicated a highly consistent and distinctive classification of the pictures. Overall, 90% of the pictures elicited negative emotions (fear or sadness), and the other 10% induced neutral to positive emotions (e.g., aesthetic emotions). The NDPS offers a new tool for studying natural events and disasters in the field of affective and cognitive sciences, which will benefit from scientific research and its practical applications. The NDPS is unrestrictedly accessible for researchers."
