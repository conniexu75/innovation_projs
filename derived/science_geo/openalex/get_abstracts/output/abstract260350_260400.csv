https://openalex.org/W1998971866,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for lung cancers with EGFR activating mutations, but these tumors invariably develop drug resistance. Here, we describe a gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line that developed resistance to gefitinib as a result of focal amplification of the MET proto-oncogene. inhibition of MET signaling in these cells restored their sensitivity to gefitinib. MET amplification was detected in 4 of 18 (22%) lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. We find that amplification of MET causes gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3 (HER3)-dependent activation of PI3K, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB family receptors. Thus, we propose that MET amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers as well."

We analyzed 386,731 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1464 patients with T2D and 1467 matched controls, each characterized for measures of glucose metabolism, lipids, obesity, and blood pressure. With collaborators (FUSION and WTCCC/UKT2D), we identified and confirmed three loci associated with T2D—in a noncoding region near CDKN2A and CDKN2B , in an intron of IGF2BP2 , and an intron of CDKAL1 —and replicated associations near HHEX and in SLC30A8 found by a recent whole-genome association study. We identified and confirmed association of a SNP in an intron of glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) with serum triglycerides. The discovery of associated variants in unsuspected genes and outside coding regions illustrates the ability of genome-wide association studies to provide potentially important clues to the pathogenesis of common diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2082122713,"Identifying the genetic variants that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans has been a formidable challenge. Adopting a genome-wide association strategy, we genotyped 1161 Finnish T2D cases and 1174 Finnish normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) controls with &gt;315,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed genotypes for an additional &gt;2 million autosomal SNPs. We carried out association analysis with these SNPs to identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D, compared our T2D association results with the results of two similar studies, and genotyped 80 SNPs in an additional 1215 Finnish T2D cases and 1258 Finnish NGT controls. We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and CDKN2B , and confirm that variants near TCF7L2 , SLC30A8 , HHEX , FTO , PPARG , and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk. This brings the number of T2D loci now confidently identified to at least 10."

Starting from genome-wide genotype data for 1924 diabetic cases and 2938 population controls generated by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, we set out to detect replicated diabetes association signals through analysis of 3757 additional cases and 5346 controls and by integration of our findings with equivalent data from other international consortia. We detected diabetes susceptibility loci in and around the genes CDKAL1 , CDKN2A/CDKN2B , and IGF2BP2 and confirmed the recently described associations at HHEX/IDE and SLC30A8 . Our findings provide insight into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the contribution of multiple variants of modest effect. The regions identified underscore the importance of pathways influencing pancreatic beta cell development and function in the etiology of type 2 diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W2014869583,"MicroRNAs are a class of small RNAs that are increasingly being recognized as important regulators of gene expression. Although hundreds of microRNAs are present in the mammalian genome, genetic studies addressing their physiological roles are at an early stage. We have shown that mice deficient for bic/microRNA-155 are immunodeficient and display increased lung airway remodeling. We demonstrate a requirement of bic/microRNA-155 for the function of B and T lymphocytes and dendritic cells. Transcriptome analysis of bic/microRNA-155 –deficient CD4 + T cells identified a wide spectrum of microRNA-155–regulated genes, including cytokines, chemokines, and transcription factors. Our work suggests that bic/microRNA-155 plays a key role in the homeostasis and function of the immune system."

Using genetic deletion and transgenic approaches, we show that the evolutionarily conserved microRNA-155 (miR-155) has an important role in the mammalian immune system, specifically in regulating T helper cell differentiation and the germinal center reaction to produce an optimal T cell–dependent antibody response. miR-155 exerts this control, at least in part, by regulating cytokine production. These results also suggest that individual microRNAs can exert critical control over mammalian differentiation processes in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1982589276,"Emerging complex functional materials often have atomic order limited to the nanoscale. Examples include nanoparticles, species encapsulated in mesoporous hosts, and bulk crystals with intrinsic nanoscale order. The powerful methods that we have for solving the atomic structure of bulk crystals fail for such materials. Currently, no broadly applicable, quantitative, and robust methods exist to replace crystallography at the nanoscale. We provide an overview of various classes of nanostructured materials and review the methods that are currently used to study their structure. We suggest that successful solutions to these nanostructure problems will involve interactions among researchers from materials science, physics, chemistry, computer science, and applied mathematics, working within a “complex modeling” paradigm that combines theory and experiment in a self-consistent computational framework."
https://openalex.org/W2068206773,"The mechanisms that allow antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to selectively present extracellular antigen to CD8 + effector T cells (cross-presentation) or to CD4 + T helper cells are not fully resolved. We demonstrated that APCs use distinct endocytosis mechanisms to simultaneously introduce soluble antigen into separate intracellular compartments, which were dedicated to presentation to CD8 + or CD4 + T cells. Specifically, the mannose receptor supplied an early endosomal compartment distinct from lysosomes, which was committed to cross-presentation. These findings imply that antigen does not require intracellular diversion to access the cross-presentation pathway, because it can enter the pathway already during endocytosis."

Rapid biological consumption and remineralization of carbon in the ""twilight zone"" (depths between the euphotic zone and 1000 meters) reduce the efficiency of sequestration. By using neutrally buoyant sediment traps to sample this chronically understudied realm, we measured a transfer efficiency of sinking particulate organic carbon between 150 and 500 meters of 20 and 50% at two contrasting sites. This large variability in transfer efficiency is poorly represented in biogeochemical models. If applied globally, this is equivalent to a difference in carbon sequestration of more than 3 petagrams of carbon per year."
https://openalex.org/W2079900215,"Dynamin 1 is a neuron-specific guanosine triphosphatase thought to be critically required for the fission reaction of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Unexpectedly, mice lacking dynamin 1 were able to form functional synapses, even though their postnatal viability was limited. However, during spontaneous network activity, branched, tubular plasma membrane invaginations accumulated, capped by clathrin-coated pits, in synapses of dynamin 1–knockout mice. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis was severely impaired during strong exogenous stimulation but resumed efficiently when the stimulus was terminated. Thus, dynamin 1–independent mechanisms can support limited synaptic vesicle endocytosis, but dynamin 1 is needed during high levels of neuronal activity."
https://openalex.org/W1984009846,"One component of the circadian clock in mammals is the Clock-Bmal1 heterodimeric transcription factor. Among its downstream targets, two genes, Cry1 and Cry2 , encode inhibitors of the Clock-Bmal1 complex that establish a negative-feedback loop. We found that both Cry1 and Cry2 proteins are ubiquitinated and degraded via the SCF Fbxl3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This regulation by SCF Fbxl3 is a prerequisite for the efficient and timely reactivation of Clock-Bmal1 and the consequent expression of Per1 and Per2 , two regulators of the circadian clock that display tumor suppressor activity. Silencing of Fbxl3 produced no effect in Cry1 –/– ; Cry2 –/– cells, which shows that Fbxl3 controls clock oscillations by mediating the degradation of CRY proteins."

The mutation, a Cys 358 Ser substitution in Fbxl3, an F-box protein with leucine-rich repeats, results in long free-running rhythms of about 27 hours in homozygotes. Circadian transcriptional and translational oscillations are attenuated in Afh mice. The Afh allele significantly affected Per2 expression and delayed the rate of Cry protein degradation in Per2::Luciferase tissue slices. Our in vivo and in vitro studies reveal a central role for Fbxl3 in mammalian circadian timekeeping."

We showed that upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice, primitive human hematopoietic cells expressing a mixed-lineage leukemia ( MLL ) fusion gene generated myeloid or lymphoid acute leukemias, with features that recapitulated human diseases. Analysis of serially transplanted mice revealed that the disease is sustained by leukemia-initiating cells (L-ICs) that have evolved over time from a primitive cell type with a germline immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene configuration to a cell type containing rearranged IgH genes. The L-ICs retained both myeloid and lymphoid lineage potential and remained responsive to microenvironmental cues. The properties of these cells provide a biological basis for several clinical hallmarks of MLL leukemias."

https://openalex.org/W2056250382,"The ability of pollutants to affect human health is a major concern, justified by the wide demonstration that reproductive functions are altered by endocrine disrupting chemicals. The definition of endocrine disruption is today extended to broader endocrine regulations, and includes activation of metabolic sensors, such as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Toxicology approaches have demonstrated that phthalate plasticizers can directly influence PPAR activity. What is now missing is a detailed molecular understanding of the fundamental basis of endocrine disrupting chemical interference with PPAR signaling. We thus performed structural and functional analyses that demonstrate how monoethyl-hexyl-phthalate (MEHP) directly activates PPARγ and promotes adipogenesis, albeit to a lower extent than the full agonist rosiglitazone. Importantly, we demonstrate that MEHP induces a selective activation of different PPARγ target genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy in living cells reveal that this selective activity correlates with the recruitment of a specific subset of PPARγ coregulators that includes Med1 and PGC-1α, but not p300 and SRC-1.

In the past, research on endocrine disruption has focused on reproductive defects caused by interference with steroid signaling, largely linked to modulation of steroid NR activity (3Henley D.V. Korach K.S. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: S25-S32Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, NRs constitute a large family of receptors regulating diverse physiological functions, out of which most members share the capacity to regulate gene expression in response to ligand binding. The concept of endocrine disruption is now being broadened to other receptors implicated in different aspects of homeostatic regulation (4Tabb M.M. Blumberg B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Given their central role in metabolic regulations (5Evans R.M. Barish G.D. Wang Y.X. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar, 6Desvergne B. Michalik L. Wahli W. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1321-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) potentially constitute important targets for environmental factors. PPARs are lipid sensors that cooperate in different organs to adapt gene expression to a given metabolic status. PPARγ (NR1C3) controls fat storage in the adipose tissue by promoting the differentiation and the survival of adipocytes, but also plays major roles in the control of insulin sensitivity (7Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, PPAR action relies on its constitutive association with the retinoid X receptor (NR2B) (8Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol.

The unliganded receptors are engaged in large complexes of corepressors and coactivators that can promote repression and activation according to the promoter context, respectively (9Tudor C.

To induce full transcriptional activation, ligand binding enhances the recruitment of coactivators acting through the remodeling of the structure and epigenetic marking of chromatin and by contacting the basal transcriptional machinery (12Feige J.N. Gelman L. Michalik L. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 120-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). PPAR activity can be pharmacologically modulated to treat major metabolic disorders (13Berger J.P. Akiyama T.E. Meinke P.T. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 2005; 26: 244-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Thiazolidinediones are PPARγ activating drugs clinically used as insulin sensitizers but PPARγ-targeted therapeutics suffer from important adverse effects (7Lehrke M. Lazar M.A. Cell. 2005; 123: 993-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). The hope of better pharmaceutical strategies arises from the identification of selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARγMs) capable of uncoupling the beneficial actions of current PPARγ agonists from their side effects (13Berger J.P. Akiyama T.E. Meinke P.T. Trends Pharmacol Sci. 2005; 26: 244-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 14Gelman L. Feige J.N. Desvergne B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The large PPAR ligand binding pocket, which can accommodate a wide variety of ligands, raises the question of whether PPAR activity and PPAR-regulated pathways could be affected by exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals. Actually, PPARα was discovered as the receptor mediating hepatic peroxisome proliferation and carcinogenesis in rodents in response to a wide class of chemicals that include pesticides, industrial solvents, and plasticizers (15Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar, 16Lai D.Y. J. Environ Sci. Health C Environ. Carcinog. Ecotoxicol. Rev. 2004; 22: 37-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have focused the present study on the interference of phthalate esters with PPAR-regulated processes. Phthalates are widely used industrial chemicals that primarily serve as plasticizers to soften PVC but are also found in cosmetics, perfumes, and certain drugs as well as in industrial paints and solvents. Diethyl-hexyl-phthalate (DEHP) is among the most abundantly used phthalate esters with an annual worldwide production estimated around 2 million tons according to Swiss authorities (Federal Office of Public Health, www.bag.admin.ch/themen/chemikalien/00228/01378). DEHP is incorporated non-covalently into flexible plastics used for manufacturing a wide variety of daily products including medical devices and food packaging and its propensity to leach can expose humans to high concentrations of this compound (17NTP-CERHR Expert Panel Di(2-ethylHexyl)Phthalate Report. National Toxicology Program, United States Department of Health and Human Services, 2000cerhr.niehs.nih.gov/chemicals/dehp/DEHP-final.pdfGoogle Scholar). The biological effects of DEHP are hence of major concern but so far elusive. Upon ingestion, pancreatic lipases present in the intestine convert DEHP to its monoester equivalent monoethyl-hexyl-phthalate (MEHP), which is preferentially absorbed (18Huber W.W. Grasl-Kraupp B. Schulte-Hermann R. Crit. Rev. Toxicol. 1996; 26: 365-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In addition, MEHP can also be produced by plasmatic and hepatic lipases, which transform DEHP directly reaching the blood through absorption or medical contamination. This metabolite activates the three PPAR isotypes and mediates the action of DEHP on hepatic peroxisome proliferation via PPARα (19Lapinskas P.J. Brown S. Leesnitzer L.M. Blanchard S. Swanson C.

This study, aimed at going beyond the toxicology approach, focuses on the molecular mechanisms through which MEHP modulates PPARγ signaling. For that purpose, we use a combination of molecular and cellular assays to directly monitor the action of the receptor in living cells. We demonstrate that MEHP promotes PPARγ-dependent adipogenesis, albeit to a lower extent than the full agonist rosiglitazone. MEHP induces the expression of a subset of PPARγ target genes required for adipogenesis when compared with rosiglitazone. Interestingly, the binding modes of MEHP and rosiglitazone to the ligand binding pocket of PPARγ seem similar. However, MEHP selectively modulates PPARγ activity according to the promoter context by promoting differential interactions with coregulators. Thus, in addition to understanding the molecular actions of MEHP beyond the toxicological observations, the combination of microscopy techniques and chromatin immunoprecipitation provides a strong molecular basis in living cells for the concept of selective PPARγ modulation. Plasmid Constructs—Mouse PPARs were expressed from pSG5 vectors (reporter assay) or from pEYFP-N1 or -C1 (imaging experiments) (8Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J.

GST-hMed1 and GST-mPGC1α were constructed by cloning PCR fragments corresponding to amino acid residues 550-716 and 1-442, respectively, in pGEX 5X3 (Amersham Biosciences). The plasmid encoding EYFP-p300N-term was constructed by cloning bases 1-1790 (residues 1-595) of the human p300 cDNA into pEYFP-C1 using HindIII and BamHI as restriction sites. The EYFP-Med1 receptor interacting domain construct was generated by cloning a PCR amplification product corresponding to residues 550-716 of Med1 into pEYFP-C1, using BglII and SalI. The YFP-NCoR construct was generated by cloning a PCR fragment corresponding to residues 2235-2301 of mNCoR into pEYFP-N1 using XhoI and SacII restriction sites. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assays—COS7, C2C12, HeLa, and 3T3L1 cells from ATCC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Transient transfection assays were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were let to recover in medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum for 5 h and then grown in serum-free medium for 18 h in the presence of ligand or vehicle only. Unless otherwise stated, Wy14,643 (Cayman Chemical Co.), L-165041 (synthesized at custom in the laboratory), rosiglitazone (Sigma), MEHP (ICI), and GW9662 (synthesized at custom by Zydus Research Center, India) were used at respective final concentrations of 10-5, 5 × 10-6, 10-6, 10-4, and 2 × 10-5m. Reporter Assay—PPAR activity was monitored on a (PPRE)3-luciferase reporter construct kindly provided by Dr. Evans (Salk Institute, San Diego, CA). Luciferase activity assays were performed with the Promega dual-reporter kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Renilla luciferase encoded by the normalization vector phRLTK (Promega) was used as an internal control for firefly luciferase normalization. Adipocyte Differentiation—Two-day post-confluent 3T3L1 pre-adipocytes were induced to differentiate using two different protocols: a 10-day treatment with 10 μg/ml insulin and PPARγ ligands (rosiglitazone or MEHP) or a 2-day treatment with a differentiation mixture (10 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine) followed by an 8-day treatment with 10 μg/ml insulin only. In both cases, the medium was changed every 48 h. After differentiation, cells were stained with Oil Red O for morphological analyses or RNA was extracted using phenol/chloroform (TRIzol, Invitrogen) and purified with Qiagen columns. For RNA extractions, four independent cultures were performed per condition. To determine triglyceride content, 3T3L1 cultures differentiated as described above in a 10-cm plate were lysed in 1500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 with a Dounce homogenizer and cytoplasmic extracts were collected. Relative triglyceride levels were evaluated by adding 100 μl of cytoplasmic extract to 200 μl of Infinity triglyceride reagent (Thermo-Electron Corporation) and measuring the absorbance at 500 nm. The levels of triglyceride were normalized to protein levels measured with the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) at 595 nm. siRNA Knockdown—An oligonucleotide (5′-GATCCCCAAAGCCAAGGCGAGGGCGATCTTTTCAAGAGAAAGATCGCCCTCGCCTTGGCTTTTTTTTGGAAA-3′) encoding a PPARγ siRNA (5′-AAAGCCAAGGCGAGGGCGATCTT-3′) as a hairpin was cloned into the pLVTH lentiviral vector as previously described (24Nadra K.

Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamers on 1 μg of total RNA using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) and the reaction was diluted 100 times for amplification. PCR were performed in triplicate in 384-well plates on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT cycler using commercial TaqMan probes (Applied Biosystems). Results were normalized to 3 housekeeping genes (TATA-box binding protein, eukaryotic translation elongation factor α1, and ribosomal protein S9) and quantified using qBase (25Hellemans J. Mortier G. De Paepe A. Speleman F. Vandesompele J. Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R19Crossref PubMed Scopus (2971) Google Scholar). Microarray Experiments—The mouse cDNA microarrays used in this study consisted of roughly 17,000 PCR products generated from cDNA clones and control DNAs spotted onto Nexterion AL slides (Schott). A complete description of the slides and their content can be obtained from the Lausanne DNA Array Facility (www.unil.ch/dafl). RNA quality was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nanochip assay (Agilent Technologies). A single round of amplification was performed with 3 μg of total RNA using the MessageAmp aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) following the protocol provided. 5 μg of amplified RNA was reverse transcribed with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers for 2 h at 42 °C, in the presence of either Cy3-dCTP or Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare). RNA was hydrolyzed by heating at 65 °C for 15 min in a basic environment. The solution was then neutralized and labeled cDNA was purified using a Qiagen MiniElute PCR Purification kit. The Cy3- and Cy5-labeled targets were combined, mixed with Cot 1 DNA (Invitrogen), polyadenylic acid (Sigma), and yeast tRNA (Sigma), and hybridized on custom glass microarrays at 64 °C for 20 h in 3× SSC, 0.4% SDS. Slides were then washed twice for 5 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, twice for 1 min in 0.2× SSC, once for 1 min in 0.1× SSC, and once for 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% Triton X-100. After drying, slides were scanned on a microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies) and the resulting TIFF images were analyzed using the GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Molecular Devices). Statistical analysis was performed with the R software packages sma (26Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (2829) Google Scholar) and limma (27Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 33Crossref Scopus (9157) Google Scholar). Gene expression was quantified with the sma package using print tip group lowess normalization without background subtraction (26Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P.

The three treatments (V, rosiglitazone, and MEHP) were compared pairwise using a linear model. Differential expression was assessed by fitting the linear model for the effects of the two treatments considered and computing moderated t statistics and Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rates with the limma package (27Smyth G.K. Stat. Appl. Genet. Mol. Biol. 2004; 33Crossref Scopus (9157) Google Scholar, 29Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Pulldown Experiments—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on a glutathione affinity matrix (GE Healthcare). mPPARγ was produced in vitro with reticulocyte lysates (Promega) and labeled with [35S]methionine. 3 μg of GST fusion proteins were then incubated with 15 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysate in 500 μl of binding buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm;EDTA1mm; NaCl 100 mm; Triton X-100 0.1%; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 0.2 mm; protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)) supplemented with 0.5% dry milk, during 4 h at 4 °C, with Me2SO, 10 μm rosiglitazone, or 1000 μm MEHP. Beads were washed 3 times with binding buffer and samples were boiled with 40 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE buffer (12,5 mm Tris-HCl, 20% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to a PhosphorImager (Typhoon, Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Experiments—After 10 days of treatment, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked for 10 min at room temperature in 1% formaldehyde. Cross-linking was stopped by a 5-min incubation in 0.125 m glycine and chromatin was subsequently extracted as previously described (30Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). Chromatin resuspended in 500 μl/10-cm cell culture dish was then sonicated on ice with a 24-channel multisonicator (Sonics Vibra cell) set at 40% during 120 s in 5-s sonication periods spaced by 10 s. After centrifugation, sonicated supernatants from 10 independent cultures performed were pooled in a final volume of 5 ml and immunoprecipitations were performed in triplicate with 250 μl of sonicated lysate diluted 2.5-fold in IP buffer (2 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 0.5% Triton X-100) after a 3-h preclearing at 4 °C with 5 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, and 150 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose bead (Amersham Biosciences) slurry. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4 °C under rocking with 0.5 μg of anti-Pol II antibody (Upstate Biotechnology; Clone CTD4H8 number 05-623), 1 μg of anti-p300, anti-NCoR, and anti-PGC1 (Santa Cruz; sc-584, sc-1609, and sc-13067, respectively) and 1.5 μg of anti-hemagglutinin epitope, anti-SRC1, and anti-TRAP220 (Santa Cruz; sc-805, sc-6096, or sc-5335, respectively). Complexes were recovered after a 3-h incubation at 4 °C with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Precipitates were then serially washed, using 300 μl of Washing Buffers (WB), in combinations specific for each antibody: WB I (2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl), WB II (2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 500 or 250 mm NaCl), WB III (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.25 m LiCl) and then twice with 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1). Combinations were as follows: Pol II (WB I, WB II (500 mm NaCl), WB III); CBP (WB I, WB II (500 mm NaCl), WB III, 2 times); SRC1 (WB I, WB II (250 mm NaCl) × 2); TRAP220 (WB I, WB II (250 mm NaCl), 2 times), NCoR (WB I, WB II (250 mm NaCl), 2 times); and PGC1 (WB I, WB II (500 mm NaCl), WB III). Precipitated complexes were removed from the beads through three sequential incubations of 10 min with 50 μl of 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3. Cross-linking was reversed by an overnight incubation at 65 °C. DNA was next purified with Qiaquick columns (Qiagen) and eluted in 10 μl of H2O. 2 μl of inputs and ChiP DNA were then assayed in real time PCRs using a Bio-Rad MyiQ apparatus and Bio-Rad iQ SYBR Green supermix and 1 μm primers (Proligo, France). Results from three independent experiments were normalized to inputs using the Δ/ΔCt method. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) Experiments—FCS was performed on a LSM510 ConfoCor2 (Zeiss) as previously described (8Feige J.N. Gelman L. Tudor C. Engelborghs Y. Wahli W. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17880-17890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, intensity fluctuations of the fluorescence collected between 505 and 550 nm were detected using an avalanche photodiode and recorded at 5 spots in each nucleus, with a repetition of 10 measurements per spot. Using the Origin software, the autocorrelation curves were fitted to an anomalous diffusion model to derive diffusion times, which were subsequently converted to diffusion coefficients and averaged over at least 10 cells. Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) Experiments—Sensitized emission FRET was monitored at 37 °C over at least 50 living cells using a TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope (Leica) as previously described (9Tudor C.

Sage D. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Gelman L. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2005; 68: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Briefly, fluorescence was recorded in three different settings: CFPex, 405 nm, CFPem, 465-485 nm; YFPex, 514 nm, YFPem, 525-545 nm; FRETex, 405 nm, FRETem, 525-545 nm. Laser power and detector gain were adjusted in the different channels so that equimolar concentrations of CFP and YFP give equal intensities (equimolar concentrations of CFP and YFP were obtained by expressing a fusion protein of CFP and YFP spaced by 475 residues). Settings were kept unchanged for analysis of all samples. As the ratio of CFP spectral bleed-through into the FRET channel (SBTCFP = IFRET/ICFP) determined on cells expressing CFP alone has been previously observed to vary with CFP intensity, this variation was modeled using an exponential fit (31Feige J.N. Sage D. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Gelman L. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2005; 68: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ratio of YFP spectral bleed-through into the FRET channel (SBTYFP = IFRET/IYFP) determined on cells expressing YFP alone was a constant equal to the average ratio. FRET measured in co-expressing cells was then corrected for spectral bleed-throughs and normalized for expression levels according to the following formula (31Feige J.N. Sage D. Wahli W. Desvergne B. Gelman L. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2005; 68: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), expNFRET=IFRET-ICFP×(e×exp(ICFP×f)+g)-IYFP×bICFP×IYFP(Eq. 1) where IFRET, ICFP, and IYFP are the intensities measured with the FRET, CFP, and YFP settings in the presence of both the donor and acceptor, e, f, and g are the constants determined by the fitting of the CFP SBT ratio in the presence of CFP only, and b is the average YFP SBT ratio in the presence of YFP only.

Chem. 1995; 17: 490-519Crossref Scopus (4289) Google Scholar)), by taking the dihedral angle term as is, but only the quadratic part of the bond and angle energy terms. The partial charges and van der Waals parameters of the ligand atoms were taken from the MMFF. The ligand was modeled with all hydrogens. To take account of a possible induced fit of the protein upon ligand complexation, the docking of MEHP to hPPARγ was realized based on two experimental x-ray structures of the hPPARγ ligand-binding domain (LBD) in complex with two different ligands. The first corresponds to the structure of the complex with the agonist AZ242 obtained at 2.35-Å resolution (PDB code 1I7I (34Cronet P. Petersen J.F. Folmer R. Blomberg N. Sjoblom K. Karlsson U.

https://openalex.org/W2119352721,"Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are peptides able to promote uptake of various cargos, including proteins and plasmids. Advances in recent years imply the uptake to be endocytic, where the current hurdle for efficient intracellular delivery is material being retained in the endosomes. In this study we wanted to compare the ability of various established CPPs to deliver siRNA and induce gene silencing of luciferase, with a novel designed penetratin analog having endosomolytic properties, using a noncovalent strategy. In principal, the penetratin analog EB1 will, upon protonation in the early-late endosomes, be able to form an amphipathic alpha helix resulting in permeabilization of the endosomal membrane. We demonstrate that even though all CPPs evaluated in this study can form complexes with siRNA, there is not a direct relationship between the complex formation ability and delivery efficacy. More important, although all CPPs significantly promote siRNA uptake, in some cases no gene silencing effect can be observed unless endosomal escape is induced. We find the designed endosomolytic peptide EB1 to be far more effective both in forming complexes and transporting biologically active siRNA than its parent peptide penetratin. We believe that developing CPPs with increased endosomolytical properties is a necessary step toward achieving biological effects at low concentrations for future in vivo applications."
https://openalex.org/W2035924154,"The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) has been attributed to a sudden release of carbon dioxide and/or methane. 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age determinations show that the Danish Ash-17 deposit, which overlies the PETM by about 450,000 years in the Atlantic, and the Skraenterne Formation Tuff, representing the end of 1 ± 0.5 million years of massive volcanism in East Greenland, are coeval. The relative age of Danish Ash-17 thus places the PETM onset after the beginning of massive flood basalt volcanism at 56.1 ± 0.4 million years ago but within error of the estimated continental breakup time of 55.5 ± 0.3 million years ago, marked by the eruption of mid-ocean ridge basalt–like flows. These correlations support the view that the PETM was triggered by greenhouse gas release during magma interaction with basin-filling carbon-rich sedimentary rocks proximal to the embryonic plate boundary between Greenland and Europe."

https://openalex.org/W2078073456,"Centrioles duplicate once in each cell division cycle through so-called templated or canonical duplication. SAK, also called PLK4 (SAK/PLK4), a kinase implicated in tumor development, is an upstream regulator of canonical biogenesis necessary for centriole formation. We found that overexpression of SAK/PLK4 could induce amplification of centrioles in Drosophila embryos and their de novo formation in unfertilized eggs. Both processes required the activity of DSAS-6 and DSAS-4, two molecules required for canonical duplication. Thus, centriole biogenesis is a template-free self-assembly process triggered and regulated by molecules that ordinarily associate with the existing centriole. The mother centriole is not a bona fide template but a platform for a set of regulatory molecules that catalyzes and regulates daughter centriole assembly."

Starting from this informal observation, we developed an algorithmic approach, transit node routing, that allows us to reduce quickest path queries in road networks to a small number of table lookups. For road maps of Western Europe and the United States, our best query times improved over the best previously published figures by two orders of magnitude. This is also more than one million times faster than the best known algorithm for general networks."

We showed recently that the amyloid intracellular domain (AICD), which is released by γ-secretase cleavage of APP C-terminal fragments (CTFs), is strongly increased in cells treated with alkalizing drugs (Vingtdeux, V., Hamdane, M., Bégard, S., Loyens, A., Delacourte, A., Beauvillain, J.-C., Buée, L., Marambaud, P., and Sergeant, N.

Multivesicular bodies contain intraluminal vesicles (known as exosomes) when released in the extracellular space. We demonstrate that APP, APP-CTFs, and AICD are integrated and secreted within exosomes in differentiated neuroblastoma and primary neuronal culture cells.

Taken together, a growing body of evidence suggests that APP processing takes place mainly between the plasma membrane and late endosomal compartments such as multivesicular endosomes. Herein, we studied the localization of APP and its derivatives in SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably overexpressing human APP and demonstrate that APP, APP-CTFs, and AICD accumulate in the luminal vesicles of multivesicular endosomes and are also found in exosomes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodies—APPCter-C17 is a well characterized rabbit antibody raised against the last 17 amino acids of the human APP sequence (7Vingtdeux V.

Anti-HSP70 (heat shock protein of 70 kDa) antibody was purchased from Euromedex (Mundolsheim, France), Anti-flotillin antibody was from Translab (Erembodegem, Belgium); anti-LAMP-2 and anti-Tsg101 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); and anti-EEA1 antibody (early endosome antigen 1) was from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY). The mouse monoclonal antibody 8E5 (raised against residues 444–592 of human APP770) was a generous gift from Dr. Peter Seubert (Elan Pharmaceuticals). Anti-β-tubulin antibody and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody were purchased from Sigma (Saint-Quentin-Fallavier, France).Cell Culture of SKNSH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells and Differentiation—The human neuroblastoma cell line SKNSH-SY5Y (referred to as SY5Y) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C. APP695 cDNA was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), allowing for G418 (Invitrogen) selection of clones. This APP cDNA was transfected into SY5Y cells using the ethyleneimine polymer ExGen 500 (Euromedex) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells expressing APP were selected by the addition of 200 μg/ml G418 to the cell medium. For differentiation, SY5Y cells were maintained for 15 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 7 mg/ml progesterone, 1% insulin/transferrin/selenium (Invitrogen), and 1 mm retinoic acid (Sigma). The medium was replenished every 3 days.Primary Embryonic Neuronal Culture—Rat primary cortical neurons were prepared from 17–18-day Wistar rat embryos as follows. Briefly, the brain and meninges were removed, and the cortex was carefully dissected out and mechanically dissociated in culture medium by triturating with a polished Pasteur pipette. Once dissociated and after blue trypan counting, cells were plated in 25-cm2 flasks at a density of 900 cells/mm2 in poly-d-lysine- and laminin-coated plates. For dissociation, plating, and maintenance, we used Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27 containing 200 mm glutamine and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic agent (Invitrogen). The medium was replenished every 3 days and 24 h before cell treatment.Drug Treatments—N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl)]-3-(S)-amino-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydrobenzo[e]-(1,4)-diazepin-2-one (compound E, γ-secretase inhibitor XVIII; used at a final concentration of 30 nm) and bafilomycin A1 (BafA1; used at a final concentration of 100 nm) were purchased from Calbiochem (Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). Chloroquine (10 μm) was purchased from Sigma. Cells were plated in 6-well plates 24 h before drug exposure. Cells were washed with warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped with a policeman rubber in 70 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing protease inhibitors (Complete mini, Roche Applied Science, Meylan, France). The cell homogenate was sonicated and heat-treated for 5 min at 100 °C. The protein concentration was determined using a PlusOne™ 2D Quant kit (Amersham Biosciences, Orsay, France), and samples were kept at –80 °C until used.Western Blotting and Mass Spectrometry—An equal quantity of total proteins (20 μg/lane) was loaded onto a 16.5% Tris/Tricine- or 8–16% Tris/glycine-polyacrylamide gel. Tris/Tricine/SDS-PAGE was performed following the procedure of Schägger and von Jagow (41Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar) with a PROTEAN II xi cell (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-Coquette, France). Following the final sucrose density gradient (see below), proteins were loaded onto Criterion XT/MES gels (Bio-Rad) as described previously (14Vingtdeux V. Hamdane M. Bégard S. Loyens A. Delacourte A. Beauvillain J.-C. Buée L. Marambaud P. Sergeant N. Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 25: 686-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences) at 2.5 mA/cm2/gel using a semidry NovaBlot transfer system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were reversibly stained with Ponceau red to check the quality of protein transfer. Membranes were blocked in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) skim milk for 30 min. Membranes were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate dilutions of the primary antibody and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the secondary antibody. The immunoreactive complexes were revealed using an ECL™ Western blotting kit and Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences). For mass spectrometry analyses, proteins were resolved with Criterion XT gels (Bio-Rad) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Sigma). In-gel trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analyses were performed as described previously (42Sergeant N. Bombois S. Ghestem A. Drobecq H. Kostanjevecki V. Missiaen C. Wattez A. David J.P.

Neurochem. 2003; 85: 1581-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar).Exosome Isolation and Sucrose Density Gradients—The protocol used was derived from that of Thery et al. (43Thery C. Boussac M. Veron P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Garin J. Amigorena S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). The cell culture media were centrifuged for 10 min at 1200 × g, and the supernatant was filtered on a 0.22-μm filter (Millex® GP, hydrophilic membrane of polyethersulfone; Millipore, Molsheim, France) and centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g before ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was added once with a large volume of PBS and further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. For purification of exosomes on a sucrose density gradient, the 100,000 × g pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose in HEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 7.4). A step gradient of sucrose at 2.25, 2.00, 1.75, 1.5, 1.25, 1.00, 0.75, 0.5, and 0.25 m was layered with 0.25 m exosome-containing solution. The gradient was spun at 200,000 × g for 18 h using an SW 41 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter). Fractions of 1 ml were diluted with 3 ml of HEPES/NaOH buffer (pH 7.4) and spun at 200,000 × g for 1 h using an SW 60 Ti rotor. Pellets were used for Western blotting or electron microscopy.Immunofluorescence—SY5Y cells expressing wild-type APP (APPWT; referred to as SY5Y-APPWT cells) were differentiated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips. After drug treatment, cells were fixed in 0.1 m PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and further permeabilized with 0.25% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS. After blocking in 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, the fixed materials were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the primary antibody in PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.25% Triton X-100. After washing, the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG; Molecular Probes) was used. Coverslips were mounted on slides with VECTASHIELD (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired with a Leica TCS NT laser scanning confocal microscope.For APP internalization analysis, cells were incubated with the 8E5 antibody for 1 h at 4 °C in ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and then washed and incubated at 37 °C for the times indicated. Cells were fixed as described above, permeabilized by incubation in 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody.Electron Microscopy and Gold Immunolabeling—For conventional observations, differentiated SY5Y cells pretreated or not with 10% fetal calf serum for 2 min were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.2) for 10 min. After washing, they were post-fixed with 1% osmic acid in the same buffer. The cells were then embedded in Araldite after dehydration in ethanol. Sections were collected on Parlodion-coated nickel grids and counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before observation on a Zeiss 9025 electron microscope.For immunoelectron microscopy observations, the same cells (treated or not) were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde and 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and directly embedded in LR White after dehydration. Polymerization occurred under UV light for 48 h. Sections were collected on coated nickel grids and treated for gold immunolabeling. Briefly, the sections were successively incubated for 30 min in buffer A (0.1 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 4% goat serum), antibody diluted in buffer A (for 24 h), and colloidal gold (18 nm)-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig in buffer A (1.5 h). After washing, the sections were counterstained in 4% uranyl acetate in H2O. For observation of isolated exosomes, 400 mesh carbon grids were put for 5 min on a drop of exosome pellet diluted 1:50 in PBS. After blotting, the grids were successively put in fixative solution (0.2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS), glycine solution (0.2 m in PBS), APPCter-C17 antiserum (12 h), and colloidal gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit Ig (1.5 h). Counter-staining was performed in uranyl acetate.RESULTSAccumulation of APP in Late Endosomes after Alkalizing Drug Treatments—Alkalizing drugs induce an accumulation of APP-CTFs and AICD as determined by biochemical analyses (14Vingtdeux V. Hamdane M. Bégard S. Loyens A. Delacourte A. Beauvillain J.-C. Buée L. Marambaud P. Sergeant N. Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 25: 686-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Herein, we investigated the cellular compartments in which this accumulation may arise. We investigated the cellular localization of APP in chloroquine- and BafA1-treated SY5Y-APPWT cells by immunofluorescence using 8E5 and APPCter-C17 antisera (Fig. 1). After drug treatment, APP accumulated in numerous engulfed vesicles (Fig. 1). These large engulfed vesicles were not seen under control conditions and could result from defective endocytosis or routing of APP.BafA1 has been demonstrated to reduce slightly the rate of internalization, recycling, and intracellular sorting of transmembrane protein and to completely block the transport from late endosomes to lysosomes (44van Weert A.W. Dunn K.W. Gueze H.J. Maxfield F.R. Stoorvogel W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 45van Deurs B. Holm P.K. Sandvig K. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 343-350PubMed Google Scholar). We assessed the internalization of APP in control and BafA1-treated cells. SY5Y-APPWT cells were incubated with the 8E5 antibody at 4 °C, and the kinetics of endocytosis of 8E5-APP complexes was followed by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A). Following incubation of the 8E5 antibody at 4 °C in both control and BafA1-treated cells, we observed that the membrane was delineated by immunocomplexes, demonstrating that endocytosis was repressed at low temperatures. After 5 min at 37 °C, APP was rapidly internalized in small vesicles under both conditions. Noteworthy, in control cells, the plasma membrane was not visualized, whereas in BafA1-treated cells, the plasma membrane was detected. Although indirect immunofluorescence is not quantitative, we observed that APP staining strongly disappeared under control conditions after 60 min at 37 °C. In contrast, APP staining remained intense in vesicular structures in BafA1-treated cells, and the signal at the plasma membrane was diminished. BafA1 induced the accumulation of the 8E5 antibody in vesicles resembling those observed in Fig. 1, suggesting that these vesicles belong to the endosomal/lysosomal pathway. To further characterize these vesicles, we used antibodies against markers of the early and late endosomal compartments (Fig. 2B). In control and BafA1-treated cells, antibody APPCter-C17 labeling partially overlapped EEA1 early endosome marker labeling. However, EEA1 staining did not correspond to large engulfed vesicles. Tsg101 is a marker of late endosomal compartments and particularly of multivesicular endosomes (46Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In control SY5Y-APPWT cells, few vesicles were stained by both anti-Tsg101 and APPCter-C17 antibodies. In sharp contrast, all large vesicles were stained by anti-Tsg101 and APPCter-C17 antibodies in BafA1-treated cells. We showed previously that these large vesicles are also partially positive for the LAMP-2 lysosome marker (14Vingtdeux V. Hamdane M. Bégard S. Loyens A. Delacourte A. Beauvillain J.-C. Buée L. Marambaud P. Sergeant N. Neurobiol. Dis. 2007; 25: 686-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We suggest that BafA1 treatment results in the accumulation of APP and its derivatives in late endosomal compartments.FIGURE 2APP is internalized in the presence of alkalizing drugs and colocalizes with late endosome markers. A, the kinetics of APP endocytosis was indirectly visualized by internalization of the 8E5 antibody. Cells were pretreated or not with BafA1 for 24 h, placed at 4 °C in a cold room, and incubated with the 8E5 antibody for 1 h. The temperature was then shifted to 37 °C, and cells were processed for immunofluorescence at 0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min to allow APP internalization. B, untreated SY5Y-APPWT cells (control (Ctrl)) or cells treated with BafA1 were processed for immunofluorescence and labeled with the APPCter-C17, anti-EEA1, or anti-Tsg101 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)APP and Its Derivatives Are Found in MVBs in BafA1-treated Cells—We next observed cellular organelles at the ultrastructural level in control and BafA1-treated cells. Numerous large vesicles containing smaller intraluminal vesicles were observed in BafA1-treated SY5Y-APPWT cells, but not in control cells (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 1, A and D). Immunogold labeling with our APPCter-C17 antibody showed that few gold particles were localized in vesicular structures and MVBs in control cells (supplemental Fig. 1C). SY5Y-APPWT cells were not stained by the secondary antibody alone (supplemental Fig. 1, A and D). In BafA1-treated cells, intraluminal vesicles were stained by our APPCter-C17 antibody. We hypothesized that these large vesicles correspond to engulfed MVBs.FIGURE 3MVB localization of APP in SY5Y-APPWT cells. A, ultrastructural analysis of BafA1-treated SY5Y-APPWT cells; B, immunogold labeling of APP in SY5Y-APPWT cells treated with BafA1. 18-nm gold particles were localized in the small intraluminal vesicles of a larger vesicle. Note that the shape of these vesicles is very similar to that of multivesicular structures observed in the same cells under the same conditions by ultrastructural electron microscopy (A). Nu, nucleus. Scale bars = 1 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MVBs can fuse with the plasma membrane to release their luminal content, including the small vesicles termed exosomes (33Gruenberg J.

Dis. 2005; 34: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The latter originate from the budding of the endosomal membrane to form intraluminal vesicles. If MVBs are the cell compartments in which APP metabolites accumulate, then these products should be associated with exosomes.We first investigated the presence or absence of exosome vesicles in the medium of SY5Y-APPWT cells (Fig. 4). SY5Y-APPWT cells were differentiated with retinoic acid for 15 days in a medium that did not contain fetal calf serum, which is a source of exogenous exosomes (43Thery C. Boussac M. Veron P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Garin J. Amigorena S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). To ascertain the presence of exosome-like vesicles in differentiated SY5Y-APPWT cells, the medium was collected after 24, 48, or 72 h of culture and processed as described for the isolation of secreted vesicles (43Thery C. Boussac M. Veron P. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Raposo G. Garin J. Amigorena S. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1172) Google Scholar). Flotillin and HSP70, which are often found in exosome vesicles, were used as exosome markers (36Johnstone R.M."

L. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 50455-50464). Here, we examined sulfhydryl modifications of the p65 subunit of NFκB that are responsible for NFκB inactivation. In MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells, hypoxia increased p65-NFκB DNA binding and NFκB transactivation by 2.6- and 2.8-fold, respectively. NAC blocked these events without having an effect on p65-NFκB protein levels and p65-NFκB nuclear translocation during hypoxia. Pharmacological inhibition of the NFκB pathway also induced hypoxic apoptosis, indicating that the NFκB signaling pathway is a major protective mechanism against hypoxic apoptosis. In cell lysates after hypoxia and treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (thiol alkylating agent), dithiothreitol (disulfide reducing agent) was not able to increase binding of p65-NFκB to DNA, suggesting that most sulfhydryls in p65-NFκB protein were in reduced and activated forms after hypoxia, thereby being blocked by N-ethylmaleimide. In contrast, with hypoxic cells that were also treated with NAC, dithiothreitol increased p65-NFκB DNA binding. Glutaredoxin (GRx), which specifically catalyzes reduction of protein-SSG mixed disulfides, reversed inhibition of p65-NFκB DNA binding in extracts from cells treated with hypoxia plus NAC and restored NFκB activity. This finding indicated that p65-NFκB-SSG was formed in situ under hypoxia plus NAC conditions. In cells, knock-down of endogenous GRx1, which also promotes protein glutathionylation under hypoxic radical generating conditions, prevented NAC-induced NFκB inactivation and hypoxic apoptosis. The results indicate that GRx-dependent S-glutathionylation of p65-NFκB is most likely responsible for NAC-mediated NFκB inactivation and enhanced hypoxic apoptosis. In murine embryonic fibroblasts, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), a GSH generating agent, enhances hypoxic apoptosis by blocking the NFκB survival pathway (Qanungo, S., Wang, M., and Nieminen, A. L.

NFκB belongs to the Rel family, which includes five mammalian Rel/NFκB proteins: RelA (p65), c-Rel, RelB, NFκB1 (p50/p105), and NFκB2 (p52/p100) (4Karin M. Lin A. Nat.

Once activated, NFκB translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to DNA and activates various target genes including Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, a hematopoietic-specific Bcl-2 homologue A1, caspase-8-FADD-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitory protein, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors 1 and 2, cellular inhibitors of apoptosis, and X chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP/hILP) (6Braun T.

The Rel homology region consists of a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain, and a nuclear localization signal (8Huxford T. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domains of NFκB proteins are divided into two classes depending on the presence (p65, RelB, and c-Rel) or absence (p50 and p52) of the transactivation domain (9Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). NFκB has cysteine residues close to or within its DNA-binding loops (9Ghosh G. van Duyne G. Ghosh S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 373: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), e.g. Cys59 of p50 and Cys38 of p65, that contact the DNA backbone (10Berkowitz B. Huang D.B. Chen-Park F.E. Sigler P.B. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24694-24700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cys62 of p50 is required for DNA binding activity (11Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Previously, changes in cellular redox state and disulfiram (thiocarbamate) treatment were shown to induce S-glutathionylation and subsequent inactivation of the p50 subunit of NFκB (11Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 12Brar S.S. Grigg C. Wilson K.S. Holder Jr., W.D. Dreau D. Austin C. Foster M. Ghio A.J. Whorton A.R. Stowell G.W. Whittall L.B. Whittle R.R. White D.P. Kennedy T.P. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2004; 3: 1049-1060PubMed Google Scholar). Because only p65-NFκB is responsible for transcriptional activation (13Huang D.B. Phelps C.B. Fusco A.J. Ghosh G. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 147-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it follows that glutathionylation of the transcriptionally active subunit p65 should have a more profound effect on NFκB activation than glutathionylation of the p50 subunit. The GSH/GSSG equilibrium is the major redox buffer in cells. Apart from providing cells with a reducing environment ([GSH] ≫ [GSSG]) and maintaining proteins in a reduced state, the glutathione redox couple dynamically regulates protein function via reversible disulfide bond formation (14Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., , New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar, 15Klatt P. Molina E.P.

Many modifications of protein sulfhydryls occur during oxidative stress, including formation of sulfenic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acids (16Biswas S. Chida A.S. Rahman I. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 71: 551-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). However, S-glutathionylation (i.e. formation of mixed disulfides between protein thiols and GSH (protein-SSG)) is likely the most prominent sulfhydryl modification (11Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 17Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Moreover, reversible protein-SSG formation has also gained prominence as a mechanism of cellular regulation in redox-activated signal transduction (17Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Consistent with a regulatory role, S-glutathionylation inactivates some proteins, e.g. glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, protein-tyrosine phosphatase (protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B), and nuclear factor-1; whereas activating others like human immunodeficiency virus-1 protease, microsomal glutathione S-transferase, and hRas (17Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). An oxidative environment with high GSSG can promote protein-SSG formation. However, protein-SSG formation typically occurs intracellularly without substantial changes in the GSH/GSSG ratio, indicating alternative mechanisms of protein-SSG formation that are incompletely understood (18Ghezzi P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1378-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Gallogly M.M. Mieyal J.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme glutaredoxin (GRx), also called thioltransferase, reverses protein glutathionylation in a specific and efficient manner. Accordingly, GRx is used to characterize oxidant-induced protein modification as protein-SSG (17Shelton M.D. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2005; 7: 348-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Although GRx is normally regarded as a deglutathionylating enzyme, GRx also catalyzes the reverse reaction, namely GSSG-dependent protein-SSG formation, and remarkably GRx can also enhance the rate of S-glutathionylation of proteins, e.g. actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B, by an alternative mechanism in the presence of glutathione thiol radical (GS.), despite high GSH content (20Starke D.W. Chock P.B. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14607-14613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The p50 subunit of NFκB is reported to be inactivated by S-glutathionylation, but thus far no report has described an oxidative modification of the p65 subunit. Here we report that glutathione supplementation with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) decreases resistance to hypoxia in pancreatic cancer cells by inhibition of p65-NFκB binding to DNA. The inhibition of NFκB is reversible by GRx1 in vitro, and the inhibition is diminished in cells where GRx1 is knocked down, both characteristics indicative of S-glutathionylation of p65-NFκB as the mechanism of inhibition. Thus, S-glutathionylation and inactivation of NFκB leading to hypoxic cancer cell death may provide a useful adjunct to chemotherapy against hypoxic tumors. Chemicals and Reagents—Monoclonal anti-NFκB p65, anti-actin, anti-YY-1, and horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibody against poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was purchased from Trevigen (Gaithersburg, MD). Propidium iodide and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), DRAQ-5 from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA), and JSH-23 from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). The luciferase reporter construct pNFκB-Luc was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). d-NAC was a gift from Dr. Ian Cotgreave (AstraZeneca, Stockholm, Sweden). Recombinant GRx was isolated and purified as described previously (21Yang Y. Jao S. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). NADPH was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [35S]Glutathione was from ICN Radiochemicals (San Diego, CA). GSH, GSSG reductase (yeast), mono-carboxymethyl-BSA (BSA-CM), and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture—Human MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were grown in complete culture medium containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 25 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (50 units/ml of penicillin and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Cells were grown to a 60-70% confluence before treatments. Generation of the GRx1 Knock-down Cell Line—Phoenix amphotropic cells were transfected with a puromycin-selectable pSUPER.retro.puro retroviral vector (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) containing a specific short hairpin oligonucleotide sequence against GRx1 (GRx1-shRNA) or non-silencing sequence (ns-shRNA) using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen). Viral supernatants were collected and used to infect MIA PaCa-2 cells. Cells were selected and grown in puromycin (0.5 μg/ml) containing medium and screened for GRx1 protein expression and activity. Hypoxia Experiments—MIA PaCa-2 cells were cultured on 60-mm Petri dishes (5 × 105 cells/dish) for 42 h prior to exposure to hypoxia. Subsequently, cells were preincubated in the presence and absence of NAC for 3 h in complete culture medium supplemented with 10 mm glucose and 25 mm HEPES buffer. Petri dishes were placed in hypoxic Plexiglass chambers (Billups-Rottenberg, Del Mar, CA) and sparged with 95% N2, 5% CO2; 0.5% O2, 94.5% N2, 5% CO2; or 1% O2, 94% N2, 5% CO2 at 2 p.s.i. for 4 min. Chambers were kept at 37 °C throughout the course of the experiment. The oxygen concentration of the medium inside chambers was monitored continuously for 24 h using a FOXY-18G Fiber Optic Oxygen Sensor (Ocean Optics Inc., Dunedin, FL). After an initial equilibration of oxygen between gas phase and the medium, medium oxygen concentration inside the chamber remained constant during >24 h, indicating no oxygen back diffusion into the chambers. Nevertheless, some residual oxygen did remain inside the chambers (see “Results”). Transfection and Reporter Assay for NFκB Activity—MIA PaCa-2 cells (5 × 105 cells/dish) were plated on 60-mm Petri dishes for 30 h. Subsequently, cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of plasmid containing 5× NFκB promoter fused to the firefly luciferase gene (Stratagene) or 2 μg of empty vector luciferase construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To normalize the transfection efficiency, cells were co-transfected with 2 μg of β-galactosidase control vector. Sixteen hours post-transfection, cells were pretreated for 3 h with NAC (10 mm), exposed to hypoxia or normoxia for 18 h, and then harvested. Relative luciferase activity was measured with a luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) using a luminometer (Turner Design, Sunnyvale, CA). Luciferase activity was normalized for transfection efficiency using β-galactosidase activity, which was measured using a FluoReporter® LacZ/β-galactosidase quantitation kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase activity was assessed as relative light units and used as an indicator of transcriptional induction of NFκB. NFκB Activation and Binding—Specific binding of activated NFκB was measured with a Trans-AM™ NFκB kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The oligonucleotide containing the NFκB consensus sequence (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) is immobilized onto a 96-well plate. Only the active form of NFκB in the cell extract specifically binds to the oligonucleotide. Epitopes on p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and Rel-B are accessible only when NFκB is bound to its target DNA. Nuclear extracts (5-10 μg) were added to the wells followed by primary antibody against p65 and the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The optical density was measured at 450 nm with an absorbance plate reader. Preparation of BSA-[35S]SSG—BSA-[35S]SSG was prepared as described earlier with the following modifications (22Srinivasan U. Mieyal P.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). After the reaction of S-carboxymethyl-BSA with N-succinimidylpyridyl bis(3,3′-dithiopropionate) and quenching with glycine, BSA was separated from small molecules either by gel filtration chromatography or by dialysis against two changes of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The modified BSA was then treated with excess [35S]GSH for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting BSA-[35S]SSG product was separated from [35S]GSH as described previously and typically had ∼0.9 GS eq/mol of BSA (22Srinivasan U. Mieyal P.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3199-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Radiolabel Assay for Glutaredoxin Activity—Whole cell lysates were analyzed for GRx activity with a radiolabel assay, which monitors the time-dependent release of radioactivity from BSA-[35S]SSG (23Gravina S.A. Mieyal J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3368-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Aliquots of lysate and assay buffer (0.1 m Na+/K+ phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm GSH and 0.2 mm NADPH) were pre-warmed to 30 °C and mixed with an aliquot of BSA-[35S]SSG (final concentration of 0.1 mm) to initiate the reaction (total volume 0.5 ml). Aliquots of the reaction mixtures were precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (final concentration of 10%) at 12 s, 1, 2, and 3 min, respectively. After centrifugation, the supernatants were analyzed for 35S by scintillation counting. Total rates of deglutathionylation (slopes of [35S]GSH released versus time) were corrected for non-enzymatic deglutathionylation by subtracting the rate of [35S]GSH released by GSH in the absence of cell lysate. Enzymatic rates were expressed as nanomole of product/min/mg of protein. Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared according to a modification of the method of Wang et al. (24Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 550-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured on 150-mm Petri dishes were scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were centrifuged at 1,600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were lysed in 300 μl of low salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6) on ice. After a 20-min incubation, supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts after centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Nuclear pellets were then resuspended in high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, 20% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.6) and tubes were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, centrifuged at 16,000 × g, and supernatants were saved as nuclear extracts. In Vitro Deglutathionylation Assay—Recombinant GRx1 was isolated as described previously (25Chrestensen C.A. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26556-26565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described above except 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was included in lysis buffer to block all free thiols. NEM-containing nuclear extracts were processed through spin columns (cut off 600 Da) to rid excess free NEM that potentially would inactivate the subsequent enzymatic reaction with GRx. Extracts were divided into different parts. One part was untreated and the other part was subdivided and aliquots were incubated with one of the following: (a) 4 mm dithiotheitol (DTT), (b) GRx1 plus GRx reducing system/recycling buffer (containing 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm GSH and 2 units/ml GSSG reductase), (c) recycling buffer alone. The assay was done with varying GRx1 concentrations using 1 μm (0.023 units), 100 nm, and 10 nm GRx1. The incubation times for DTT and GRx1 were 10 and 5 min, respectively. GRx1, along with its recycling system, efficiently converts glutathione-protein disulfides to free protein thiols and GSH. NEM binds irreversibly to free sulfhydryl groups but does not react with cysteine residues that are already oxidized. Subsequently, p65-NFκB DNA binding activity was measured by ELISA. Western Blot Analysis—At the indicated time points, total cell extracts were prepared in ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatants were assayed for total protein content (Bio-Rad). Equivalent amounts of protein were diluted in sample buffer (200 mm Tris-Cl, 15% glycerol, 10% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, pH 6.8) and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then transferred and immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. Immunodetection was accomplished by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). Immunocytochemistry—MIA PaCa-2 cells were cultured on 35-mm glass bottom Petri dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA). Cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. After washes using Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), cells were incubated with blocking solution (1% BSA in TBST) for 1 h followed by primary monoclonal antibody against p65 NFκB (1:100) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times with TBST and incubated with anti-mouse secondary Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. DRAQ-5 (1 μm) was included in the final wash to stain the nuclei. Images of Alexa Fluor 488 fluorescence were collected using 488-nm excitation and >505-nm emission filters. DRAQ-5 fluorescence was imaged with a 633-nm excitation light and >640-nm emission filter using a Zeiss 510 NLO laser scanning confocal microscope. Caspase-3 Activation—Caspase-3 activity was measured using a Caspase-Glo™ 3/7 kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At an indicated time point, cultured MIA PaCa-2 cells were collected into a test tube followed by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended and lysed with RIPA buffer. Caspase-Glo™ 3/7 reagent and the lysate were mixed in 1:1 ratio, and luminescence was measured with a luminometer. The resulting luminescence is proportional to caspase activity. Apoptosis Assay—Apoptotic cell death was determined from nuclear morphology after propidium iodide staining in the presence of digitonin. At the indicated time points, floating and adherent cells were collected, centrifuged, and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 200 μm digitonin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and 25 μm propidium iodide (Molecular Probes). Digitonin permeabilizes the plasma membrane and allows propidium iodide to enter cells and stain all nuclei. Thus, propidium iodide staining in the presence of digitonin is equivalent to staining with Hoechst and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, the two commonly used fluorescent dyes in the literature to assess apoptosis on a cell by cell basis. Apoptotic nuclei were scored as apoptotic based on nuclear condensation and fragmentation and counted by a ×40 microscope objective using a rhodamine filter set and expressed as a percentage of total cells. At least 200 cells were counted from three different microscopic fields for each sample. In addition, we previously showed that apoptotic death after hypoxia plus NAC treatment assessed by propidium iodide and digitonin correlates closely with apoptotic death assessed with a Cell Death Detection ELISA PLUS kit (Roche Applied Science), which measures mono- and oligonucleosomes of 180-bp multiples formed in the cytoplasmic fractions during apoptosis (3Qanungo S. Wang M. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50455-50464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Differences were assessed by two-tailed paired Student's t test with Instat Software (GraphPAD, San Diego, CA). A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. NAC-induced Apoptosis Is Oxygen-dependent in Pancreatic Cancer Cells—Our previous study showed that NAC, a GSH generating agent, enhanced hypoxic apoptosis in transformed murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by a mechanism apparently involving GSH-dependent suppression of NFκB transactivation (3Qanungo S. Wang M. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50455-50464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Because several hypoxia-dependent genes are activated within a narrow O2 concentration range, we wanted to determine the window within which NAC is capable of enhancing hypoxic apoptosis in cancer cells. We exposed MIA PaCa-2 cells to different concentrations of O2 in the presence and absence of NAC (10 mm). Based on direct measurements with an oxygen probe, O2 concentrations in chambers flushed with 95% N2, 5%CO2; 0.5% O2, 94.5% N2, 5%CO2; and 1% O2, 94% N2, 5%CO2 were 0.6, 1.6, and 2.1% O2, respectively. Thus, even in chambers with 95% N2, 5%CO2, medium O2 content did not reach zero (anoxia), possibly due to residual O2 in the gas mixture and outgassing of O2 from plastic Petri dishes and other plastic parts inside the chamber. Hypoxia alone for 22 h in 2.1, 1.6, and 0.6% O2 induced very little apoptosis (1.9% during normoxia versus 4.7, 3.7, and 3.1%, respectively). In contrast, NAC (10 mm) enhanced hypoxic apoptosis in a O2-dependent manner (2.4% during normoxia versus 10.3, 19.6, and 22.6%, respectively) (Fig. 1A). NAC is rapidly taken up by the cells. Once inside the cells, endogenous esterases release free l-cysteine, which is a precursor of GSH synthesis (26Jiang B. Brecher P. Hypertension. 2000; 35: 914-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Like NAC, GSH ester (5 mm) enhanced apoptosis from 2.4% (normoxia) to 24% after 22 h exposure to hypoxia (1.6% O2) (Fig. 1B). To confirm that NAC-mediated enhancement of apoptosis in hypoxic cells was due to an increase in GSH, we incubated cells with the d-isomer of NAC (d-NAC), which is not a precursor of GSH synthesis. Unlike the l-isomer of NAC, the d-isomer did not promote hypoxic apoptosis in MIA PaCa-2 cells (Fig. 1B). NAC activated caspase-3 in hypoxic cells indicative of apoptotic death (Fig. 1C). PARP is a target of cysteine proteases, and caspase-3 cleaves 116-kDa PARP into a 85-kDa fragment during apoptosis (27Qanungo S. Basu A. Das M. Haldar S. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 4149-4157Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Hypoxia alone did not cause PARP cleavage assessed by Western blot analysis. In contrast, hypoxia in combination with NAC (10 mm) produced the 85-kDa cleavage product of PARP (Fig. 1D). Collectively, the results from Fig. 1 indicate that elevated GSH is responsible for enhancing hypoxic apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells in agreement with our previous results in MEFs (3Qanungo S. Wang M. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50455-50464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NFκB Activation Is Oxygen-dependent in MIA PaCa-2 Cells—Hypoxia alone (1.6 and 0.6% O2) increased NFκB luciferase activity by 2.4- and 2.8-fold, respectively, compared with normoxia. The increase was blocked by NAC (Fig. 2A). To determine whether blockade of hypoxia-induced transcriptional activation of NFκB was due to decreased p65-NFκB binding to DNA, NFκB DNA binding was measured. Hypoxia (1.6% O2) alone (18 h) increased p65-NFκB DNA binding 2.1-fold (compared with normoxia), which was abolished by NAC (Fig. 2B). NAC also affected NFκB target genes. In our previous study, we identified XIAP as a target gene for NFκB during hypoxia to MEFs (3Qanungo S. Wang M. Nieminen A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50455-50464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We also confirmed NFκB-dependent activation of XIAP in MIA PaCa-2 cells during hypoxia, which was prevented by NAC (data not shown). The results indicated that NAC treatment inhibited transcriptional activation of NFκB thereby inhibiting the survival of hypoxic cancer cells. NAC Does Not Change NFκB Protein Levels—NFκB inactivation by NAC may also b"
https://openalex.org/W2157723507,"Experience-dependent plasticity in adult visual cortex is believed to have important roles in visual coding and perceptual learning. Here we show that repeated stimulation with movies of natural scenes induces a rapid improvement in response reliability in cat visual cortex, whereas stimulation with white noise or flashed bar stimuli does not. The improved reliability can be accounted for by a selective increase in spiking evoked by preferred stimuli, and the magnitude of improvement depends on the sparseness of the response. The increase in reliability persists for at least several minutes in the absence of further movie stimulation. During this period, spontaneous spiking activity shows detectable reverberation of the movie-evoked responses. Thus, repeated exposure to natural stimuli not only induces a rapid improvement in cortical response reliability, but also leaves a 'memory trace' in subsequent spontaneous activity."

Experimental studies in transgenic mouse models of AD have demonstrated that Aβ immunization reduces Aβ plaque pathology and improves cognitive function.

We provide evidence that treatment of AD mutant neuroblastoma cells or primary neurons with Aβ antibodies decreases levels of intracellular Aβ. Antibody-mediated reduction in cellular Aβ appears to require that the antibody binds to the extracellular Aβ domain of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and be internalized.

Moreover, cultured neurons from APP mutant transgenic mice develop subcellular Aβ accumulation and synaptic alterations that parallel those observed in vivo in the brain with β-amyloidosis (26Takahashi R.H.

Moreover, Aβ antibody treatment protects against synaptic alterations that occur in APP mutant neurons in culture.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA Constructs—Wild-type (wt) and mutant (K44E) dynamin-1 cDNA containing GFP were previously described (28Herskovits J.S.

Cells were transfected overnight using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-GFP antibody was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology.Cell Culture and Treatments—Primary neuronal cultures from Tg2576 mice (29Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3655) Google Scholar), and littermates were prepared as described (26Takahashi R.H. Almeida C.G. Kearney P.F. Yu F. Lin M.T. Milner T.A. Gouras G.K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3592-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Primary neurons were used at 19 days in vitro (DIV). Mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells either untransfected (N2a) or stably transfected with the 670/671 Swedish mutation human APP (Sw-N2a) were grown as described previously (30Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with the C-terminal fragment of human APP C99 (C99-N2a) were previously described (31Netzer W.J. Dou F. Cai D. Veach D. Jean S. Li Y. Bornmann W.G. Clarkson B. Xu H. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12444-12449Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Chloroquine (Sigma, 100 μm) and NH4Cl (Sigma, 50 mm) were added to cells 1 h prior to treatment and kept in culture during 3 h antibody incubation. The γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl-l-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT; Calbiochem) was diluted in culture media to 250 nm and then added to cells for 3 h.Antibody Treatment—Several well characterized Aβ antibodies were used: monoclonal 6E10 (human Aβ residues 5–10; IgG1) and 4G8 (Aβ residues 17–24; IgG2B) (Signet Laboratories), G2-11 (Aβ42 C terminus; IgG1; Genetics Co.), anti-Aβ42 (Aβ42 C terminus; Chemicon), polyclonal anti-Aβ40 (Aβ40 C terminus; Chemicon), and polyclonal APP-ab2 (human Aβ residues 1–10; Labvision NeoMarkers). Other antibodies used were: monoclonal P2-1 (specific for the N terminus of human APP; IgG1; Affinity BioReagents) and mouse anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). We added fresh medium to cells just prior to each treatment. Final antibody concentration in all treatments was 2 μg/ml. Antibodies were added to the culture for different time points, as indicated. Treatment for 24 h with Aβ antibody 6E10 did not induce neuronal death, evaluated using the TUNEL labeling method and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay (see below). For internalization studies, neurons were kept at 4 °C for 45 min with the indicated antibody. Cells were then either immediately fixed (0 min) or incubated at 37 °C for 10, 30, 60, or 180 min and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB).Cell Death Assay—19 DIV Tg2576 neurons grown on poly-d-lysine precoated coverslips were incubated 24 h with or without 6E10 antibody. Neurons were washed twice with PB saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The TUNEL staining kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to stain apoptotic neurons according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclei were stained with the Hoechst stain. Counts of TUNEL positive nuclei and total nuclei were performed with Metamorph (Universal Imaging Co.) on 6–10 fields per coverslip at 20× magnification. The ratio between TUNEL-positive nuclei and Hoechst-positive nuclei was calculated. LDH kit (Sigma) was used to evaluate whether antibody treatment was inducing cell damage after incubation for 24 h with or without Aβ antibodies. Levels of LDH were measured in the media according to the manufacturer's instructions.Aβ Immunoprecipitation and Detection—Primary neurons and Sw-N2a cells were washed twice, harvested in ice-cold PBS, and centrifuged. Cell lysates were treated with 6% SDS containing 10 μl/ml of β-mercaptoethanol, sonicated, and then heated at 95 °C for 6 min. After centrifugation, supernatants were either loaded directly (neuron lysates) into 10–20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen) for Aβ detection or immunoprecipitated (N2a cells) overnight at 4 °C with 4G8 antibody (in 190 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 6 mm EDTA and 2.5% Triton X-100). The latter were then incubated with rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Cappell) together with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were boiled in PBS for 5 min and immunoblotted as described (26Takahashi R.H. Almeida C.G. Kearney P.F. Yu F. Lin M.T. Milner T.A. Gouras G.K. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3592-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The immunoreaction was visualized by a chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Band intensities were quantified using Scion Image software. The area under the band peak and above the baseline was quantified. To determine secreted APPβ levels, media were centrifuged 5 min at 1,000 × g to pellet cellular debris. 1 ml of supernatant was collected and incubated with an antibody against secreted APPβ (Signet) overnight at 4 °C (in 190 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 6 mm EDTA, and 2.5% Triton X-100). Samples were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody together with protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The same media were further used to immunoprecipitate secreted APPα fragments with antibody 6E10 in the same conditions described for secreted APPβ. Western blot analyses were performed as described above using 22C11 (Roche Applied Science) as primary antibody.ELISA Analyses—19 DIV Tg2576 primary neurons or Sw-N2a cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of antibody 6E10 or 4G8 and collected as described previously. Concentrations of Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 were measured by using the respective ELISA kits (BIOSOURCE) according to manufacturer's instructions.Biochemical Measurements of Surface APP—19 DIV primary neurons or Sw-N2a cells were incubated for 3 h with antibody 6E10. After two washes with PBS containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PBS-Ca-Mg), cells were placed on ice to block endocytosis and incubated with PBS-Ca-Mg containing 1 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 20 min. Cultures were rinsed in ice-cold culture medium to quench the biotin reaction. Cultures were lysed in 200 μl of 3% SDS. The homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Fifteen microliters of the supernatant were removed to measure total protein levels; the remaining supernatant was incubated with 100 μl of Neutravidin agarose (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. Samples were then washed three times with a buffer containing: 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Bound proteins were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled. Quantitative Western blots were performed on both total and biotinylated (surface) proteins using APP N-terminal antibody 22C11 and tubulin antibody (Sigma). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and captured on autoradiography film (Amersham Biosciences Hyperfilm ECL). Digital images, produced by densitometric scans of autoradiographs on a Scan-Maker 8700 (Microtek) were quantified using NIH Image 1.63 software. The surface/total APP ratio was calculated for each culture.Degradation Assay for APP and C99—Sw-N2a or C99-N2a cells were treated with biotin as described above. After cells were rinsed in ice-cold culture medium to quench the biotin reaction, fresh ice-cold medium containing 6E10 antibody (2 μg/ml) was added. Cells were kept on ice for 5 min to allow the antibody recognition of surface APP or C99. Cells were then placed at 37 °C for 45 min. After treatment, cells were collected and lysed as described for the assay of surface APP, above. Western blot analyses of full-length APP were performed using 22C11 antibody; Western blot analyses of C99 peptides were performed using 6E10 antibody.Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (Fisher). After antibody treatment, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS and fixed for immunofluorescence, as described previously (27Almeida C.G. Tampellini D. Takahashi R.H. Greengard P. Lin M.T. Snyder E.M. Gouras G.K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: Aβ42, synapsin I, and PSD-95 (Chemicon), APP 369 (anti-C terminus of APP, (30Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), EEA1 (BD Transduction), Tsg101 (Genetex), and Lamp2 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Fluorescent secondary antibodies were either Alexa-488 or Alexa-546 (Molecular Probes) or Cy2- or Cy3-conjugated (Jackson ImmunoResearch). To determine antibody uptake, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies with or without prior permeabilization with 0.1% saponin. Cells were viewed with an Olympus Optical IX-70 microscope equipped with an ORCA-ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu Photonics) and a 60×, 1.4 NA plan apochromat objective. Metamorph software was used for quantitative analysis. To quantify Aβ immunofluorescence, 5–10 neurons or Sw-N2a cells were randomly picked from each of three independent experiments, and average intensities were measured in selected areas. To quantify Aβ staining in Sw-N2a cells after transfection with the dynamin-1 cDNA containing GFP, we only considered cells that were transfected (GFP-positive). For quantification of 6E10 antibody internalization and Aβ42 staining, intensity threshold was set using Metamorph 6.1 so that fluorescence of neurons was above background fluorescence. Total fluorescence per 30 μm of a thresholded neurite was automatically quantified. PSD-95 puncta were quantified as described previously (27Almeida C.G. Tampellini D. Takahashi R.H. Greengard P. Lin M.T. Snyder E.M. Gouras G.K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). One or two coverslips from each culture were analyzed, 5–10 neurons per coverslip. From each neuron, 3–5 neuritic segments 30 μm in length were selected from areas where single puncta could be outlined. Images were thresholded so that only the brightest puncta, with intensity at least twice that of the neuritic shaft, were outlined. Using the integrated morphometric analysis feature in Metamorph, puncta density was automatically measured.Confocal Microscopy—Immunofluorescence Aβ antibody internalization and intracellular Aβ reduction were examined by confocal microscopy using an Axiovert 100 M inverted microscope equipped with an LSM 510 laser scanning unit and a63 × 1.4 NA plan apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), Ar488, HeNe1543 nm lasers, and LP560 and BP505–530. Optical sections were acquired at 0.7 μm thickness.Live Cell Microscopy of Antibody Uptake—Cells were imaged using an Olympus Optical IX-70 microscope equipped with an ORCA-ER CCD camera, a 60×, 1.4 NA plan apochromat objective and a 37 °C heated chamber. Images were obtained using a Hamamatsu Orca ER digital camera. N2a cells were transfected with human APP-YFP for 3–4 h. Cells were incubated for 10 min on ice with Alexa-555-conjugated 6E10 antibody (6E10 was labeled using an Alexa Fluor 555 Monoclonal Antibody Labeling Kit, Invitrogen) in live imaging solution (120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes). Cells were washed twice in ice cold live imaging solution before imaging. Frames were automatically and sequentially acquired every 20 s with the FITC and Rhodamine filters using Metamorph.Metabolic Labeling—Primary neurons were plated in 10-cm dishes. 7-Day-old cultures after 30-min starvation in cysteine/methionine-free medium (Invitrogen) were pulsed in fresh cysteine/methionine free medium with 1 mCi [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence or absence of 2 μg/ml Aβ antibody 6E10 for 20–30 min and then chased in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) for 15 min, 45 min, or for media studies, 90 min. Media were centrifuged for 10 min transferred to clean tubes and immunoprecipitated with Aβ antibody 4G8. Cells were collected in ice-cold PBS and lysed. Samples were immunoprecipitated with Aβ antibody 4G8. 35S signal was visualized using a phosphoimager system (Hewlett Packard Cyclone).Statistical Analysis—Statistical comparisons were made using unpaired t tests with significance placed at p < 0.05. A set of cultures prepared from one mouse embryo was considered as one independent experiment (n = 1). One section prepared from one Tg2576 mouse was considered as one independent experiment (n = 1). Data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 3.0 software (GraphPad Software).RESULTSTreatment with monoclonal Aβ antibodies (6E10, 4G8; Fig. 1A) reduced levels of Aβ in primary neurons at 19 DIV derived from Tg2576 mice harboring the Swedish mutant human APP and in N2a neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with AD Swedish mutant human APP (Sw-N2a) (Fig. 1, B–G). Specifically, treatment of cultured Tg2576 neurons with 2 μg/ml of Aβ antibodies for 24 h resulted in a 36 ± 12% (6E10) and 30 ± 11% (4G8) decrease in levels of Aβ as quantified by Western blot (Fig. 1B, E). In contrast to these N-terminal to mid Aβ domain/APP antibodies, treatment of neurons with G2-11, a C-terminal-specific Aβ42 antibody (Fig. 1A), did not induce changes in intracellular levels of Aβ (Fig. 1E), suggesting that binding to the exposed extracellular domain of Aβ was required for Aβ antibody-mediated reduction in intracellular Aβ. Similar reductions in levels of Aβ after treatment with Aβ antibodies were evident by ELISA analyses, where reduction of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 was observed with either 6E10 or 4G8 treatment (Fig. 1D). To further confirm these biochemical results, we also evaluated intracellular Aβ immunofluorescence (32Almeida C.G. Takahashi R.H. Gouras G.K. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4277-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) following Aβ antibody treatment, which revealed a reduction in intracellular Aβ42 immunofluorescence in cultured Tg2576 neurons as shown by confocal imaging (Fig. 1C). Treatment for 24 h with Aβ antibody 6E10 did not alter neuronal morphology or induce neuronal death as evaluated using the TUNEL labeling method or the LDH assay (supplemental Fig. S1). Western blot analyses demonstrated that incubation of Sw-N2a cells with Aβ antibodies had similar reductions in levels of Aβ. Specifically, 24 h of treatment with Aβ antibodies 6E10 or 4G8 reduced levels of intracellular Aβ by 51 ± 10% and 54 ± 11%, respectively, compared with untreated controls (Fig. 1F). Since these Aβ antibodies bind Aβ peptides and the Aβ domain within APP, we also treated Sw-N2a cells with a monoclonal antibody directed against the N-terminal ectodomain of human APP (antibody P2-1, Fig. 1A); this treatment did not reduce levels of intracellular Aβ (Fig. 1F). ELISA analyses confirmed the reductions of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 after 24 h treatment with Aβ antibodies 6E10 or 4G8 in Sw-N2a cells (Fig. 1G).To investigate the mechanism whereby Aβ antibodies reduced intracellular Aβ, we examined whether the binding of cell surface APP by Aβ antibodies might be involved. Sw-N2a or untransfected N2a cells were first incubated with 6E10 or 4G8 for 24 h and then fixed, rinsed and stained with a fluorescent secondary antibody without cell permeabilization. The human-specific antibody 6E10 stained the cell surface of Sw-N2a cells (expressing human APP) but not the surface of untransfected N2a cells (expressing only mouse APP) (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, when the secondary antibody was applied after cell permeabilization, both Aβ antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 were pronounced within Sw-N2a cells (Fig. 2B), consistent with the internalization of the antibodies. In contrast, incubation for 24 h with human IgG revealed absence of labeling inside cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that non-specific antibody uptake was not occurring. Moreover, treatment of N2a cells (lacking the human APP transgene) with human specific 6E10 antibody did not reveal significant intracellular labeling, indicating that 6E10 antibody uptake only occurred in the presence of human APP (Fig. 2B). To evaluate whether this result might be due to less intracellular Aβ in untransfected N2a cells, we treated N2a cells with Aβ antibody 4G8, which is not human specific and also recognizes the murine Aβ domain. Confocal Z stack images indicated a cytoplasmic staining of 4G8 in permeabilized N2a cells (supplemental Fig. S2), supporting that lower intracellular Aβ levels do not preclude Aβ antibody uptake.FIGURE 2Aβ antibodies that bind at the cell surface are internalized into cells. A, untransfected N2a and Sw-N2a cells were treated with the indicated antibodies for 24 h and then stained with fluorescent anti-mouse IgG without permeabilization. Aβ antibodies 6E10 and 4G8 revealed a cell-surface pattern of staining in Sw-N2a cells. The human-specific antibody 6E10 did not show such surface labeling in untransfected mouse N2a compared with the Sw-N2a cells. APP ectodomain antibody P2-1 revealed surface staining in Sw-N2a cells. B, untransfected N2a and Sw-N2a cells were treated with the indicated primary antibodies for 24 h, fixed, and then permeabilized and stained with fluorescent secondary antibodies. Only antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of APP (P2-1), including those to the Aβ domain (6E10, 4G8), were internalized. In contrast, mouse IgG, antibody G2-11 (Aβ42), and antibody Aβ40 were not internalized, and untransfected N2a cells lacking human APP did not demonstrate uptake of the human Aβ-specific antibody 6E10. C, live cell imaging of N2a cells transfected with APP-YFP and incubated with Alexa-555-conjugated 6E10 for 30 min with images acquired at 20-s intervals. Internalized fluorescently tagged Aβ antibody 6E10 (red) co-localized with APP-YFP (green) in the same vesicle moving retrograde in a process toward the cell body. The images were offset 5 pixels horizontally to better differentiate the fluorophores. The artificially large and confluent yellow area of co-staining just to the right and under the darkly staining nucleus in the cell body is secondary to the increased gain required to visualize fluorescence in the thinner process below (magnified in the lower set of frames). D, internalization of Aβ antibody 6E10 with time correlated with reduced Aβ42 within Tg2576 neurons. Scale bar: 10 μm. E, detail of representative processes more clearly revealed the correlation between increasing internalization of Aβ antibody 6E10 (green) and decreasing levels of Aβ42 (red"
https://openalex.org/W1989126982,"In developing progeny of mammals the two parental genomes are differentially expressed according to imprinting marks, and embryos with only a uniparental genetic contribution die. Gene expression that is dependent on the parent of origin has also been observed in the offspring of flowering plants, and mutations in the imprinting machinery lead to embryonic lethality, primarily affecting the development of the endosperm-a structure in the seed that nourishes the embryo, analogous to the function of the mammalian placenta. Here we have generated Arabidopsis thaliana seeds in which the endosperm is of uniparental, that is, maternal, origin. We demonstrate that imprinting in developing seeds can be bypassed and viable albeit smaller seedlings can develop from seeds lacking a paternal contribution to the endosperm. Bypassing is only possible if the mother is mutant for any of the FIS-class genes, which encode Polycomb group chromatin-modifying factors. Thus, these data provide functional evidence that the action of the FIS complex balances the contribution of the paternal genome. As flowering plants have evolved a special reproduction system with a parallel fusion of two female with two male gametes, our findings support the hypothesis that only with the evolution of double fertilization did the action of the FIS genes become a requirement for seed development. Furthermore, our data argue for a gametophytic origin of endosperm in flowering plants, thereby supporting a hypothesis raised in 1900 by Eduard Strasburger."

Here we identify the matricellular protein Nephroblastoma Overexpressed (Nov, CCN3) as being essential for their functional integrity. Nov expression is restricted to the primitive (CD34) compartments of umbilical vein cord blood, and its knockdown in these cells by lentivirus-mediated RNA interference abrogates their function in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, forced expression of Nov and addition of recombinant Nov protein both enhance primitive stem and/or progenitor activity. Taken together, our results identify Nov (CCN3) as a regulator of human hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2088418102,"Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that is highly regulated and when dysregulated contributes to cancer. The Mcl-1 protein is phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to different signaling events. Phosphorylations at Thr163 (by ERK) and Ser159 (by glycogen-synthase kinase 3β) have recently been shown to slow and enhance, respectively, Mcl-1 protein turnover. Phosphorylation is also known to be stimulated at other, as-yet uncharacterized sites in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Using an S peptide-tagged Mcl-1 T163A mutant, Ser64 was identified as a novel Mcl-1 phosphorylation site by mass spectrometry. Immunoblotting demonstrated that phosphorylation at this site was maximal in cells in G2/M phase, was enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-α-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment, was blocked by inhibitors of CDK (but not ERK or glycogen-synthase kinase 3β), and was stimulated in vitro by CDK 1, CDK2, and JNK1. The half-life of a nonphosphorylatable S64A Mcl-1 mutant was indistinguishable from that of the wild type polypeptide. In contrast, this mutant failed to protect cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, whereas reconstitution with the phosphomimetic S64E Mcl-1 mutant rendered cells TRAIL-resistant. This anti-apoptotic phenotype of the S64E Mcl-1 mutant was also associated with enhanced binding to the proapoptotic proteins Bim, Noxa, and Bak. A pharmacological CDK inhibitor that reduced Ser64 phosphorylation also sensitized cells to TRAIL cytotoxicity. Collectively, these observations not only identify G2/M-associated phosphorylation at Ser64 as a critical determinant of the antiapoptotic activity of Mcl-1 but also elucidate a novel mechanism by which CDK1/2 inhibitors can enhance the effectiveness of the cytotoxic cytokine TRAIL.

Thus, the mechanisms that regulate Mcl-1 play an important role both in controlling cell survival in normal tissues and in preventing the emergence of tumors.Mcl-1 expression is regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. The transcription factors SRF/ETS, STAT3, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, and PU.1 have been found to regulate Mcl-1 gene expression in various cell types (22Akgul C. Turner P.C. White M.R.

Hepatology. 2005; 42: 1329-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). At the post-translational level, Mcl-1 is targeted for proteasomal degradation after ubiquitylation by an E3 ligase termed MULE (11Zhong Q. Gao W. Du F. Wang X. Cell. 2005; 121: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). This susceptibility of Mcl-1 to degradation is phosphorylation-dependent. In particular, ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at Thr163 within the PEST region prolongs the Mcl-1 half-life (6Domina A.M. Vrana J.A. Gregory M.A. Hann S.R. Craig R.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 5301-5315Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In contrast, following Thr163 phosphorylation, Ser159 phosphorylation by GSK-3β reportedly enhances Mcl-1 ubiquitylation and degradation (8Maurer U. Charver C. Wagman A.S. Dejardin E. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 749-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Consistent with the latter results, Akt (cellular homolog of v-Akt/protein kinase B) inhibition, which activates GSK-3β, results in Mcl-1 down-regulation (7Kobayashi S. Werneburg N.W. Bronk S.F. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 2005; 128: 2054-2065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Mcl-1 is also down-regulated by inhibitors of CDK9 that diminish its synthesis (20Taniai M. Grambihler A. Higuchi H. Werneburg N.W. Bronk S.F. Farrugia D.J. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J.

Smith J.H. Craig R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21688-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation is prominent in cells accumulating in G2/M phase upon exposure to microtubule disrupting agents and is also seen in synchronized cells passing through this phase. Bcl-2, the prototypic member of this family, likewise undergoes phosphorylation at multiple sites, one of which is stimulated during the G2/M phase (30Ito T. Deng X. Carr B. May W.S. J. Biol.

Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 can affect its stability and/or antiapoptotic function, with differing effects being reported in different systems. For example, phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87 was associated with both enhanced antiapoptotic activity and slowed turnover in cells (35Deng X. Gao F. Flagg T. May W.S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 6: 153-158Crossref Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In the case of Mcl-1, JNK-mediated phosphorylation on Ser121 has been reported to sensitize cells to oxidative stress-induced cell death apparently without affecting turnover (36Inoshita S. Takeda K. Hatai T. Terada Y. Sano M. Hata J. Umezawa A. Ichijo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43730-43734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation may affect the function as well as its turnover of Mcl-1.The present studies were performed to identify additional phosphorylation sites in Mcl-1 distinct from the Thr163 and Ser159 sites that influence turnover. These studies demonstrated that Mcl-1 phosphorylation on Ser64, which is catalyzed by CDK1, CDK2, or JNK1 in vitro, is increased in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and contributes to the antiapoptotic activity of Mcl-1 by enhancing its binding to proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members rather than altering its expression. Consistent with these results, a CDK inhibitor that blocked Ser64 phosphorylation also sensitized cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Thus, although phosphorylation at Thr163/Ser159 regulates Mcl-1 turnover, a distinct pathway involving phosphorylation at Ser64 regulates its anti-apoptotic function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The CDK inhibitor SU9156 (37Moshinsky D.J.

After at least six washes with lysis buffer, the samples were released from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Radioactivity was determined by autoradiography using a phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) at room temperature for 3-6 days. Thr163- and Ser64-specific phosphorylations were detected by immunoblotting using phospho-epitope-specific antibodies as described below.Phosphorylation Site Analysis—KMCH cells stably transfected with S peptide-tagged T163A Mcl-1 were cultured in 10-cm dishes.

The tagged polypeptide was released into SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad) in 20% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid. The Mcl-1 band was excised and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by quadruple time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry analysis at the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility, Harvard Medical School.Immunoblotting—The cells were directly lysed for 30 min on ice with lysis buffer and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. After protein concentration was determined by the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal.

Fluorescent images were captured by an Odyssey fluorescent imager (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), and their intensities were quantitated using Odyssey software, version 1.2.Primary antibodies used at the following dilutions were obtained from the indicated suppliers: polyclonal rabbit anti-Mcl-1 antibody (S19) at 1:1000, polyclonal goat anti-β-actin antibody (C11) at 1:2000, monoclonal mouse anti-Bcl-2 antibody (clone C2) at 1:100, and polyclonal goat anti-caspase 8 large subunit antibody (T16) at 1:100 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); monoclonal mouse anti-Mcl-1 antibody (clone 22) at 1:1000 from BD Pharmingen (Franklin Lakes, NJ); monoclonal mouse anti-Bcl-xL antibody (clone 2H12) at 1:200 from BIOSOURCE (Carlsbad, CA); polyclonal goat anti-Bid antibody (AF860) at 1 μg/ml fromR&D Systems (Minne-apolis, MN); monoclonal rat anti-BimS antibody (14A8) at 1:500 from Chemicon (Temecula, CA); polyclonal rabbit anti-Bax antibody at 2 μg/ml and polyclonal rabbit anti-Bak NT at 2 μg/ml from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); polyclonal goat anti-DR5 antibody at 1:200 and polyclonal rat anti-cFLIP antibody at 1:200 from Alexis (San Diego, CA); and polyclonal rabbit anti-DR4 antibody at 1:500 (Axxora, San Diego, CA). Monoclonal mouse anti-S peptide antibody was generated as previously described (39Hackbarth J.S. Lee S.H. Meng X.W. Vroman B.T. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 835-839PubMed Google Scholar). Affinity-purified rabbit antiserum recognizing the Mcl-1 Thr163 phospho-epitope generated by Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) was used at 1:500.Production and Purification of Rabbit Polyclonal Anti-Ser(P)64-Mcl-1 Phospho-specific Antiserum—A 15-amino acid peptide (Mcl-1 amino acids 57-71) with a phosphoserine at position 64 and an N-terminal cysteine was synthesized by the Mayo Clinic Proteomics Core. After conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, the peptide was utilized to immunize rabbits according to standard procedures. To permit affinity purification of serum, the immunizing peptide and its nonphosphorylated counterpart were individually conjugated to SulfoLink-Sepharose (Pierce) according to the supplier's protocol. Immune serum was then passed sequentially over columns containing the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated peptides; and purified antibodies were eluted from the second column with glycine (pH 2.2). Protein-containing fractions were dialyzed into PBS with 0.02% sodium azide and concentrated using Centriprep YM-30 centrifugal filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Purified antibodies were stored at -80 °C.Dot blot analysis was employed to examine the specificity of the affinity-purified antisera for the phosphorylated peptide. Bovine serum albumin-conjugated peptides with phosphorylated or unphosphorylated serine 64 were serially diluted into a dot blot apparatus, and detection was performed as described above under “Immunoblotting.”Detection of Mcl-1 Phosphorylation at Ser64—Because the phospho-specific anti-Mcl-1 (Ser64) antibody generated does not yield a reliable signal on immunoblot of total protein lysates, enrichment of Mcl-1 was necessary. For analysis of the endogenous Mcl-1 phosphorylation, Mcl-1 was immunoprecipitated from parental KMCH cells using a polyclonal anti-Mcl-1 antibody (S19), followed by immunoblot analysis for total (S19) or Ser64-phosphorylated Mcl-1. For KMCH cells transfected with the S peptide-tagged Mcl-1 mutants (see below), protein S-agarose purification was used to recover tagged Mcl-1 prior to immunoblot analysis.In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Plasmid encoding GST-Mcl-1 was generated by subcloning Mcl-1 lacking the transmembrane domain into the commercially available pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). BL21 cells transformed with the plasmid were cultured in 10 ml of Circlegrow (Q-BIOgene, Carlsbad, CA) plus ampicillin (100 μg/ml) until the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.8-1.5. The cells were then induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The harvested cells were lysed with BugBuster® (Novagen), benzonase, lysozyme, and protease inhibitor mixture II (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for 20 min and transferred into a glutathione-agarose column under gravity flow. After washing with GST bind/wash buffer (Novagen), the bound protein was eluted with glutathione (Novagen). The elution buffer was exchanged to the corresponding kinase buffer (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), and the protein was concentrated using Centriprep YM-30 centrifugal concentrators (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay (40Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays were performed by incubating GST-Mcl-1 protein with CDC2 (CDK1) plus cyclin B or CDK2 plus cyclin A (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) in the presence of 1 mm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. After the reaction was terminated with SDS sample buffer, the samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Ser(P)64 Mcl-1 antiserum to detect the phosphorylated species. Equal loading of GST-Mcl-1 was verified by blotting for total Mcl-1.For JNK phosphorylation studies, BL21 cells were lysed as above and clarified by centrifugation. Glutathione-agarose (100 μl of 50% slurry) was then added to 1 ml of supernatant and mixed end-over-end at 4 °C overnight. The glutathione-agarose bound to GST-Mcl-1 was harvested by centrifugation, washed six times in bind/wash buffer, and rinsed one time with kinase buffer. GST-Mcl-1 still bound to glutathione-agarose was used as a substrate for JNK1α1 (Cell Signaling Technologies, Beverly, MA) or JNK2α2 (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) under conditions suggested by the respective suppliers. After 30 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The samples were boiled and resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with anti-Ser(P)64 Mcl-1 antiserum to detect the phosphorylated species. Equal loading of GST-Mcl-1 was verified by blotting for total Mcl-1.Site-directed Mutagenesis—pcDNA3.1 containing the full-length Mcl-1 cDNA has been previously described (41Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). A 15-amino acid S peptide tag (KETAAAKFERQHMDS) with GA linker (total 28 amino acids) was inserted at the N terminus of Mcl-1 essentially as described (39Hackbarth J.S. Lee S.H. Meng X.W. Vroman B.T. Kaufmann S.H. Karnitz L.M. BioTechniques. 2004; 37: 835-839PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding the S pep-tide-tagged Mcl-1 was then subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to generate S peptide-tagged T163A, S64A, and S64E mutants using a QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the supplier's instructions. To allow expression of the S peptide-tagged variants in cells expressing Mcl-1 shRNA, the wild type and mutant tagged Mcl-1 cDNAs were rendered shRNA-resistant by silent mutation of the third nucleotides in four of the targeted codons to the sequence cgggactggctagttaaac using the same site-directed mutagenesis kit. Finally, for stable transfection, the cDNAs were subcloned into pcDNA 3.1 Hygro(+) (Invitrogen). All of the plasmids were subjected to automated sequencing to verify the described mutation and confirm that no additional mutations were present. These plasmids were prepared for transfection using a plasmid miniprep kit (Bio-Rad).Generation of KMCH Stable Transfectants—Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Stably transfected clones were selected in medium containing 1200 mg/liter G418 or both G418 plus 200 mg/liter hygromycin. Individual colonies were isolated using cloning rings, subcloned, and screened by immunoblotting. Established clones were maintained in medium supplemented with 400 mg/liter G418 and/or 200 mg/liter hygromycin.Mcl-1 Half-life Estimation—KMCH cells stably expressing shRNA to the endogenous Mcl-1 and stably expressing S pep-tide-tagged Mcl-1 constructs (described above) were treated for a total of 4 h with vehicle or TRAIL. During this treatment, 20 μg/ml cycloheximide was added for 0-120 min. At the end of the incubation, floating cells were collected by centrifugation added to adherent cells, and lysed, followed by the addition of SDS sample buffer in preparation for SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. After blots were probed with anti-Mcl-1 and anti-actin antibodies, the signals were detected and quantified using an Odyssey fluorescent imager as described above. Exponential trend lines from three independent experiments were calculated using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office, Microsoft, Redmond, WA). Half-life was determined by the formula t½ = ln(2)/λ, where λ is the decay constant.Determination of Mcl-1 Binding Partners—KMCH cells expressing short interfering RNA-resistant S peptide-tagged mutant (S64A or S64E) and short interfering RNA against endogenous Mcl-1 were solubilized in lysis buffer containing 1% CHAPS in place of Triton X-100. Tagged Mcl-1 was pulled down using S protein-agarose. Pelleted proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, clarified by centrifugation, separated by electrophoresis, and probed using antibodies to the indicated Bcl-2 family members.Measures of TRAIL-induced Cytotoxicity in KMCH Cells—After treatment with TRAIL as indicated in the various figure legends, apoptosis was quantitated by identifying the characteristic nuclear changes of apoptosis (i.e. chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation) using the nuclear binding dye DAPI and fluorescence microscopy. To assess changes in caspase 3/7 activity, cells plated in 96-well plates were assayed using the commercially available Apo-ONE homogenous caspase 3/7 assay (Promega, M"

In addition to ERα, coactivator SRC-3, acetylated histones and phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (P-polII) were detected on all three EREs in the presence of estrogen, while basal recruitment of ERα and P-polII was observed only on the proximal element. Chromatin loops were formed between each ERE and the GREB1 transcriptional start site in the presence of estrogen but not of a total antiestrogen. Furthermore, estradiol induced physical association between EREs, suggesting that these elements function as a potent multipartite enhancer to regulate GREB1 transcription.

Some estrogen target genes, such as those encoding cyclin D1 (CCND1), c-myc (MYC), and E2F transcription factors have been shown to mediate the proliferative effects of estrogen in breast cancer cell lines (18D'Cruz C.M.

Thompson D.A. Weigel R.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6367-6375PubMed Google Scholar), whose function remains unknown, contributes to the growth-promoting effects of estrogens in MCF-7 cells (23Rae J.M.

ERs can bind to specific DNA motifs, called estrogen response elements (EREs) through a central conserved DNA binding domain (24Mader S. Chambon P. White J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Consensus EREs, which were defined by compiling natural response elements in estrogen-responsive genes and correspond to the highest affinity binding site in vitro, are 15-bp palindromes composed of two PuGGTCA motifs spaced by 3 bp (25Klinge C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2905-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar, 26Sanchez R. Nguyen D. Rocha W. White J.H. Mader S. Bioessays. 2002; 24: 244-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although most high affinity EREs were initially characterized in the proximal regulatory sequences of target genes, recent studies have indicated that elements binding ERα can be found at large distances from transcriptional start sites (TSS). Our genome-wide mapping of high affinity EREs combined with characterization of elements by chromatin immunoprecipitation identified functional ERα binding sites up to 10 kb from TSS (27Bourdeau V. Deschenes J. Metivier R. Nagai Y. Nguyen D. Bretschneider N. Gannon F. White J.H. Mader S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1411-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). In addition, genome-wide mapping of chromatin fragments bound by ERα revealed sites located much further from adjacent genes, and use of chromatin conformation capture (3C) assays showed that some of these elements can form chromatin loops with promoters located at distances of up to 100 kb (15Carroll J.S. Liu X.S. Brodsky A.S. Li W. Meyer C.A. Szary A.J. Eeckhoute J. Shao W. Hestermann E.V. Geistlinger T.R. Fox E.A. Silver P.A. Brown M.

Often, ERα binds several chromatin regions within this range of distances from the TSS of estrogen-regulated genes, raising the possibility of cooperativity between widely separated enhancer units for transcriptional regulation of target genes. This may result in the formation of multiple chromatin loops with the TSS of these target genes and possibly between enhancers themselves. GREB1 stands out as an estrogen target gene because of the presence in its flanking region of three consensus EREs spread over 20 kb of upstream sequences. We have previously observed in vivo recruitment of ERα to the EREs present at –1.5 and –9.5 kb (27Bourdeau V. Deschenes J. Metivier R. Nagai Y. Nguyen D. Bretschneider N. Gannon F. White J.H. Mader S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1411-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Here we address whether the three GREB1 consensus EREs are functional enhancers that cooperate for transcriptional induction of the GREB1 gene by ERα and present evidence for a complex chromatin loop structure that implicates all three EREs and the TSS. Cell Culture—MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and Ishikawa cells were maintained in α-minimal Eagle's medium (Wisent, St-Bruno, Quebec, Canada) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). ZR75 and T47D were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Wisent) supplemented with 10% FBS. MDA-MB-231::ERα cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Wisent) supplemented with 5% FBS with 0.15 mg/ml of hygromycin (Sigma). Three days before experiments, cells were switched to phenol red-free DMEM (Wisent) containing 10% charcoal-treated FBS (FBS-T), 1% sodium pyruvate (Wisent), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Wisent), and 1% l-glutamine (Wisent). The day before hormonal stimulation, the medium was changed to phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 0.5% charcoal-treated FBS. Cells were then treated with 17-β-estradiol (E2, 25 nm, Sigma), ICI 182,780 (ICI, 100 nm, Tocris, Ellisville, MO) or vehicle (0.1% ethanol) for variable periods of time as indicated in the figure legends. RNA Extraction—Cells were seeded in 10-cm plates (MCF-7, T47D, ZR75, MDA-MB-231::ERα) or 6-cm plates (Ishikawa) at a density such that near confluence was obtained at the end of the treatment. Cells were treated with 25 nm E2, 100 nm ICI 182,780, or vehicle (ethanol) for different times, as indicated in the figure legends. For pretreatments with actinomycin D (2 μg/ml) or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), incubation was initiated 1 h before hormonal treatment. siGenome siRNAs were transfected according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL), medium was changed 24 h after transfection and hormonal stimulations were initiated after another 24 h. At the end of the treatments, medium was removed, cells were collected in 1 ml of TRI Reagent (Sigma), and total RNA was extracted as recommended by the manufacturer. Reverse Transcription and Real-time PCR—Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using the RevertAid H first minus strand cDNA synthesis kit (MBI Fermentas, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) as recommended by the manufacturer. The reverse transcription product was diluted 10 times prior to real-time PCR. Each real-time PCR amplification reaction contained the reverse transcription dilution (2 μl), forward and reverse primers (150–300 nm), MgCl2 (3–4.5 mm according to primer pairs), dNTP (0.2 mm), SYBR Green (0.33×, Invitrogen, Burlington, Ontario, Canada), buffer for Jump Start Taq and Jump Start Taq (0.5 unit, Sigma) in a final volume of 20 μl. After denaturation at 95 °C for 7 min, samples went through a one-degree annealing temperature touchdown of 7 cycles starting from 60 °C (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at annealing temperature, 30 s at 72 °C) followed by 40 cycles of amplification (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 58 °C and 30 s at 72 °C). A dissociation protocol followed the amplification program to characterize the amplified product(s). PCR was performed using a RotorGene 3000 (Corbett, Australia) and analyzed using expression levels of the p36b4 gene for normalization. For each set of primers, non-template control reactions were performed as a negative control. Each sample was assayed in triplicate and each experiment was reproduced at least two times. A typical experiment is shown. All primer pairs were designed using the Primer3 software and chosen to span an intron. The primer sequences and individual conditions used for polymerase chain reaction amplification are available upon request. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell extracts and blot analysis were performed as described previously (28Rocha W. Sanchez R. Deschenes J. Auger A. Hebert E. White J.H. Mader S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 68: 1852-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using anti-ERα mouse monoclonal (B10, kind gift from Prof. P. Chambon) and anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (AC-15, Sigma Diagnostics). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—For chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, cells in phenol red-free DMEM containing 0.5% FBS-T were treated with vehicle (ethanol), E2 or ICI for 45 min. Chromatin was cross-linked by treating cells with 1.5% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and fragmented by sonication as reported previously (27Bourdeau V. Deschenes J. Metivier R. Nagai Y. Nguyen D. Bretschneider N. Gannon F. White J.H. Mader S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1411-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), yielding fragments of average size ∼400 bp. Antibodies against ERα (SC-543), SRC-3 (SC-7217), or normal IgG (rabbit: SC-2027, goat: SC-2028; mouse: SC-2025) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and antibodies against phosphorylated polymerase II (05-623) or acetylated histone H4 (06-598) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Chicago, IL). The sequences of the primers used in ChIP assays (Sigma Genosis) are available upon request. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed at least two times with similar results. A representative set of results is shown. 3C Assays—3C assays were performed essentially as described (29Splinter E. Grosveld F. de Laat W. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 493-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), with only minor modifications. In short, 3 days prior to the experiment, MCF-7 cells were switched to phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% FBS-T and repeated for 48 h at 9 million cells per 15-cm Petri dish. The serum concentration was decreased to 0.5% 24 h before treatment with E2 (25 nm), ICI (100 nm), or vehicle (ethanol) for 45 min. Culture medium was removed, and cells were fixed with 1.5% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline solution, collected in 500 μl of collection buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture), washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). Nuclei were resuspended in 2 ml of Tango 1.2× buffer (MBI Fermentas) supplemented with SDS. Triton X-100 was added to sequester the SDS. The cross-linked DNA was digested overnight with 400 units of restriction enzyme MspI or XceI (MBI Fermentas) and then with another 100 units for 2 h at 37 °C. The restriction enzyme was inactivated by addition of SDS and incubation at 65 °C. Genomic DNA concentrations were measured in 30-μl aliquots for standardization between samples. The reactions were diluted with ligase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin), supplemented with Triton X-100 (1% final concentration), and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The DNA was ligated using T4 ligase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) overnight at 16 °C. RNase was added, and samples were incubated overnight at 65 °C to reverse the cross-links. The following day, samples were incubated for 2 h at 45 °C with proteinase K, and the DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitation. Chromatin loop formation was assessed by PCR amplification carried out using similar conditions as for real-time-PCR amplification but without SYBR Green and with two nested primer pairs for each predicted ligation event. PCR products were visualized on ethidium bromide agarose gels (2%) and confirmed by sequencing. Primer sequences are available upon request. To better characterize the mechanisms of regulation of the GREB1 gene by estrogen, we first assessed the influence of estradiol (E2) treatment on its expression in different ER+ cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, ZR45, MDA-MB-231::ERα, and Ishikawa). Transcriptional induction was detected in all ER+ cells with E2 treatment whereas the antiestrogen ICI 182,780 (ICI) reduced mRNA levels (supplemental Fig. 1A). Consistent with these findings, a strong correlation between higher GREB1 mRNA levels and ERα expression in breast tumors can be observed in various microarray studies compiled by Oncomine (supplemental Fig. 1B). To confirm the involvement of ERα in transcriptional regulation by estrogen, we assessed the effect of siRNA-mediated suppression of ERα on GREB1 mRNA expression levels in MCF-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, levels of ERα proteins were reduced by the specific siRNA duplex (Fig. 1A) resulting in a substantial reduction of both basal and estrogen-stimulated levels of GREB1 mRNA (Fig. 1B), which together with the effect of ICI treatment indicates that ERα is important for both basal and activated GREB1 mRNA expression. To further verify that GREB1 is regulated at the transcriptional level by E2, MCF-7 cells were pretreated by the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. This treatment prevented induction of GREB1 transcripts, indicating that E2 enhances GREB1 de novo transcription (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had no effect on the induction by E2 in MCF-7 cells (GREB1, supplemental Fig. 2A), as reported (22Ghosh M.G. Thompson D.A. Weigel R.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6367-6375PubMed Google Scholar), similar to what was observed with the E2 target gene encoding the progesterone receptor (PGR, supplemental Fig. 2A), while induction of the BRCA1 gene was abrogated by cycloheximide and that of pS2/TFF1 was largely attenuated as reported previously (30Marks J.R. Huper G. Vaughn J.P. Davis P.L. Norris J. McDonnell D.P. Wiseman R.W. Futreal P.A. Iglehart J.D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2A). Kinetics of induction of GREB1 transcripts by E2 in MCF-7 cells resembled that of the PGR target gene, being both rapid (detectable at 2 h), and sustained over a 48 h period (supplemental Fig. 2B). On the other hand, induction of E2 targets MYC or FOS was more rapid but transient (supplemental Fig. 2C), while that of pS2/TFF1 was progressive and that of BRCA1 delayed in time (supplemental Fig. 2D). Together, these results indicate that GREB1 is a primary ERα target induced in an early, strong, and sustained manner by ERα in MCF-7 cells. The 5′-flanking sequences of GREB1 contain three consensus EREs (Fig. 2A), and we have previously shown that two of the three GREB1 EREs strongly bound ERα in ChIP experiments in MCF-7 cells and in MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with ERα (27Bourdeau V. Deschenes J. Metivier R. Nagai Y. Nguyen D. Bretschneider N. Gannon F. White J.H. Mader S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 1411-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Recruitment of ERα to the three EREs was also observed in a recent genome-wide mapping of ERα binding sites in the presence of estrogen (17Carroll J.S. Meyer C.A. Song J. Li W. Geistlinger T.R. Eeckhoute J. Brodsky A.S. Keeton E.K. Fertuck K.C. Hall G.F. Wang Q. Bekiranov S. Sementchenko V. Fox E.A. Silver P.A. Gingeras T.R. Liu X.S. Brown M. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Here we show that in MCF-7 cells all three perfect EREs are bound with a cyclical temporal pattern after E2 stimulation (Fig. 2B), as observed previously for the pS2/TFF1 gene (31Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 32Metivier R. Penot G. Hubner M.R. Reid G. Brand H. Kos M. Gannon F. Cell. 2003; 115: 751-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). Note, however, that the basal levels of ERα recruited to the ERE at –1.5 kb from the GREB1 TSS were higher than those for other EREs. Only faint binding of ERα to the GREB1 TSS was observed under our experimental conditions. In addition, recruitment to the EREs of the ERα coactivator SRC-3 (Fig. 2C), acetylated histone H4 (Fig. 2D), as well as phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (P-polII) (Fig. 2C) was also detected by ChIP assays. Note that binding of P-polII was strong under basal conditions on the –1.5-kb ERE. Altogether, these data suggest that the two distal EREs are functional enhancers and that the proximal ERE contributes to the low basal, ICI-repressed activity of the promoter. While ChIP data indicate recruitment of ERα and its coactivator SRC-3, acetylation of histone H4 and binding of P-polII to sites that are closer to the GREB1 TSS than to any other gene (the closest gene, E2F6, is located more than 45 kb away from ERE3), this does not conclusively demonstrate that these EREs play a role in direct transactivation of GREB1. To investigate whether all three EREs associate with the GREB1 TSS, we used a chromatin conformation capture (3C) assay (33Dekker J. Rippe K. Dekker M. Kleckner N. Science. 2002; 295: 1306-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar), which detects physical proximity between distal DNA sites by ligation of restricted DNA fragments that are maintained juxtaposed by cross-linked DNA-protein complexes. Using restriction enzymes that cut at least once between consensus EREs and the GREB1 TSS, we observed PCR amplification of products resulting from the ligation of each of the three EREs and the TSS (Fig. 3A). Association of ERE1 (–1.5 kb) and the TSS was constitutive, which could reflect either the higher basal level of receptor and P-polII associated with this ERE (see Fig. 2C) or the short distance between the ERE and the TSS. However, the lack of chromatin loop formation in the presence of ICI suggests formation of a chromatin loop in the absence of hormone rather than random interactions between the two DNA fragments. No chromatin loops were detected with several regions located between the EREs and the TSS (Fig. 3A and data not shown) or between the TSS and a fragment at +1.5 kb downstream (data not shown), demonstrating that E2-induced chromatin looping with the TSS is specific for fragments containing the EREs. Note that the 3C PCR products obtained were sequenced to confirm product identity and that all primer sets for 3C detection led to amplification of a digested and re-ligated BAC clone overlapping this genomic region (data not shown). These results indicate that the consensus EREs in the GREB1 gene behave as E2-induced enhancers since they recruit ERα, SRC-3, and P-polII, are associated with acetylated histones, and interact with the TSS of GREB1 in the presence of E2. The presence of three strong enhancers raises the question of whether these sequences associate with the TSS in a mutually exclusive and possibly sequential manner or if they may participate in reciprocal interactions as well. To investigate this question, we analyzed by 3C whether chromatin loop formation could take place between ERE enhancers themselves (Fig. 3B). PCR amplification resulting from chromatin loop formation between any combinations of two consensus EREs could be detected in the presence of E2 but not in its absence or in the presence of ICI. In addition, no interactions were detected with other intermediate regions (Fig. 3B and data not shown), demonstrating again the specificity of these interactions for the presence of EREs. These results suggest that EREs can physically associate with each other, either in a large complex with the TSS or in transient binary interactions (see model in supplementary Fig. 3). Based on the above findings, we conclude that the 5′-flanking region of GREB1, a gene of as yet unknown function but that may play an important role in E2-induced cell proliferation (23Rae J.M. Johnson M.D. Scheys J.O. Cordero K.E. Larios J.M. Lippman M.E. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 2005; 92: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), contains a strong, multipartite enhancer composed of three consensus EREs separated by 8 to ∼20 kb of intervening sequences. Future studies will be necessary to assess whether this multipartite enhancer also interacts with additional ERα binding regions and with the TSS of other E2 target genes and whether transcriptional regulation by E2 often involves the association of several widely spread enhancer units.

The Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels that support the Ca2+ entry have been characterized and extensively studied in cells of the immune system but their molecular identity remained elusive until it was reported that CRAC currents are nearly completely absent in T cells of patients, who suffered from a hereditary severe combined immunodeficiency (1Feske S. Prakriya M. Rao A. Lewis R.S. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 202: 51-62Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Using linkage analysis, the genetic defect in these patients has been identified as a single missense mutation in the orai1 gene, indicating that ORAI1 is an essential component or regulator of CRAC channel complexes (2Feske S.

Site-directed mutagenesis of acidic residues in its transmembrane segments 1 and 3 indicated that ORAI1 is an essential pore subunit of CRAC channel complexes (5Prakriya M. Feske S. Gwack Y.

As shown by recent overexpression studies with ORAI1 and STIM1, ORAI1 has minute effects on endogenous CRAC currents of transfected cells, while STIM1 transfected alone or in combination with ORAI strongly amplifies the endogenous CRAC currents indicating that STIM1 is critically involved in the activation of ionic channels formed by ORAI1 (8Mercer J.C.

The STIM1 protein contains only one transmembrane segment and, interestingly, a single unpaired EF hand Ca2+-binding motif located in the N terminus (11Williams R.T. Manji S.S. Parker N.J.

The C terminus of STIM1 is sufficient to activate CRAC channels (12Huang G.N. Zeng W. Kim J.Y. Yuan J.P. Han L. Muallem S. Worley P.F.

Furthermore, STIM1 can be located both in the membrane of the ER and in the plasma membrane and function as ER Ca2+ sensor and as cell surface signaling protein, respectively (13Spassova M.A. Soboloff J.

Upon stimulation of the phospholipase C signaling pathway, STIM1 and ORAI1 likely cluster in the ER and plasma membrane, respectively, and thereby form functional ionic channel complexes that support CRAC currents and capacitative Ca2+ entry (15Luik R.M.

Besides ORAI1, two additional ORAI isoforms (ORAI2 and ORAI3) have been reported so far (2Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A.

Although less effective than ORAI1, ORAI2 also amplifies substantially endogenous CRAC currents and enhances store-operated Ca2+ influx when co-expressed with STIM1 in HEK 293 cells (8Mercer J.C. Dehaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Wedel B. Boyles R.R. Bird G.S. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24979-24990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). By contrast to ORAI1, however, the overexpression of ORAI2 and STIM1 has almost no effect on the store-operated Ca2+ influx in T cells and fibroblasts from severe combined immunodeficiency patients (16Gwack Y.

Chem. 2007; 282 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (325) Google Scholar), suggesting that ORAI1 and ORAI2 might differ functionally. In this study, we have analyzed the genomic organization, tissue expression pattern and functional properties of the murine ORAI2. For the purpose of comparison, we have also cloned the murine ORAI1, ORAI3, and STIM1. Two orai2 gene loci and two splice variants of the murine ORAI2 (ORAI2L and ORAI2S) were identified in the present study. By contrast to ORAI1 and ORAI3, ORAI2 appeared not to be ubiquitously expressed in mice tissues. We studied the functional properties of the murine ORAI1 and ORAI2 variants in two cell lines, HEK 293 and RBL 2H3 cells, which are commonly used in studies of overexpressed ORAIs and endogenous CRAC currents, respectively. Using specific antibodies, we found that these cell lines provide different ORAI and STIM1 backgrounds for the functional analysis of recombinant ORAI proteins. In co-expression experiments with STIM1, we found that the difference between CRAC channels formed by the murine ORAI1 and ORAI2 variants resides in their sensitivity to inactivation by internal Ca2+ and in their levels of functional expression, which appears to be cell background-dependent. Additionally, we detected functional interactions between ORAI1 and ORAI2 variants. Cloning of orai1, orai2l, orai2s, orai3, and stim1—The sequences of orai1, orai2, orai3, and stim1 were predicted using the GeneFinder software (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). We identified several orai2 related EST clones, which indicated that two possible start methionines and a common stop codon are present in the orai2 genes. Therefore, we used two different sets of primers to amplify the cDNAs of orai2 from brain total poly(A+) RNA by reverse transcription-PCR. The 792-bp cDNA fragment encoding ORAI2L was amplified with the primers 5′-ccgccgccaccatgaagaagggagagacacac-3′ and 5′-tcacaccacctgcaggctc-3′, and the 750-bp cDNA fragment encoding ORAI2S with the primers 5′-ccgccgccaccatgagtgcagagctcaatg-3′ and 5′-tcacaccacctgcaggctc-3′. The latter primers were also used to amplify orai2 from genomic DNA (annealing conditions: 58 °C, 10 s; elongation conditions; 72 °C, 50 s; 53 cycles). The following primers were used to amplify orai1, orai3, and stim1 cDNAs from mouse brain poly(A+) RNA (orai1 and stim1) and mouse placenta poly(A+) RNA (orai3): 5′-ccgccgccaccatgcatccggagcctgcc-3′ and 5′-ttaggcatagtgggtgccc-3′, 5′-ccgccgccaccatgaagggcggcgagggg-3′ and 5′-ctaaagccaggcttacac-3′, and 5′-ccgccgccaccatggatgtgtgcgcccg-3′ and 5′-ctacttcttaagaggcttc-3′, respectively. At least three independent clones of all orai and stim1 cDNAs were double-stranded sequenced. These cDNAs and the cDNAs of the mouse Ca2+ channel GAMMA subunits 1 (CaVγ1) and 2 (CaVγ2) (17Held B. Freise D. Freichel M. Hoth M. Flockerzi V. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 459-468Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) were subcloned in the bicistronic expression vector pdi described elsewhere (18Wissenbach U. Bodding M. Freichel M. Flockerzi V. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Southern and Northern Analysis—Full-length cDNAs of the orai1, orai2, orai3, and stim1 were used to probe murine Northern blots containing ∼5 μg poly(A+) RNA per lane. Filters were exposed overnight to x-ray films or for 4 h to phosphoimager screens. For genomic Southern analysis, a probe corresponding to exon 5 of the orai2 gene was used to probe EcoRI-restricted genomic DNA (15 μg). Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells and RBL cells expressing the human muscarinic receptor M1 (RBL 2H3) were cultured as previously described (19Aneiros E. Philipp S. Freichel M. Cavalié A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasmids containing the cDNAs of the murine STIM1, ORAI1, ORAI2L, ORAI2S, GAMMA1, and GAMMA2 were transfected into these cells either individually or in combination using the PolyFect transfection reagent (Quiagen). In the individual transfections, 3 μg of each plasmid were used per cell dish. For co-transfections, the STIM1 plasmid was mixed with one of the plasmids containing ORAI1, ORAI2L, ORAI2S, GAMMA1, and GAMMA2 at a ratio of 1:2. The total amount of plasmid mix was 3 μg per cell dish. In the triple co-transfections, plasmids containing STIM1, ORAI1, and either ORAI2L or ORAI2S were mixed at a ration of 1:2:1. Accordingly, the total amount of plasmid mix was 4 μg per cell dish. The bicistronic expression vector pdi contained the cDNA of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP) as expression marker. Patch clamp experiments were performed on GFP expressing cells 2–3 days after transfection. Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis—Polyclonal antibodies recognizing mouse, rat, and human ORAI1 (antibody 1003) and ORAI2 proteins (ab 1004) were generated in-house by immunizing rabbits with epitopes corresponding to the C-terminal amino acid sequences derived from ORAI1 and ORAI2, which are identical in the ORAI1 and ORAI2 amino acid sequences from humans, rat, and mouse. The antisera were affinity-purified and used at 1:1000 to 1:2000 dilutions. The antibody for human, mouse and rat STIM1 was obtained from BD Biosciences. Protein lysates were prepared from equal numbers of non-transfected and transfected cells. Microsomal membrane protein fractions were prepared from non-transfected HEK 293, RBL-2H3, and Jurkat T cells. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA assay, and 100–150 μg of protein were separated by standard SDS-PAGE or by the method decribed by Schägger and von Jagow (20Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) using Tricine as the trailing ion. The latter method allows a superior solution of proteins, especially in the range between 5 and 35 kDa as is the case for ORAI1 (calculated Mr 33,062), ORAI2L (Mr 29,802), and ORAI2S (Mr 28,199), but the 14 amino acid difference between ORAI2L and ORAI2S were not resolvable. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp experiments were performed in the tight-seal whole-cell configuration at room temperature using an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Ionic currents were recorded during voltage clamp ramps from +80 to –100 mV (duration 150 ms) delivered every 2 s and for at least 100 s. In those experiments, in which the bath solution was exchange, the ramps were delivered every 0.5 s. The holding potential was 0 mV and the sampling rate was 20 kHz. Capacitive currents were determined and corrected in advance of each voltage clamp ramp. The development of ionic currents over time was monitored using current amplitudes measured at –90 mV in each individual voltage clamp ramp. The current densities at –90 mV were calculated as the current amplitude subtracted by the individual background current and divided by the appropriate initial Cslow value. The standard pipette solution contained 120 mm CsCl, 8 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 μm IP3, 10 mm EGTA and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 (CsOH). Additionally, we used a pipette solution that contained: 120 mm cesium glutamate, 8 mm NaCl, 10 mm BAPTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 μm IP3 and 10 Hepes, pH 7.2 (CsOH). The standard bath solution was as follows: 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm CsCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.2 (NaOH). In some experiments, the Ca2+ concentration of the latter solution was increased to 10 mm. For the nominally Ca2+-free (NCaF) solution, CaCl2 was removed and for the divalent-free (DVF) solution, CaCl2 and MgCl2 were removed and 10 mm EDTA was added. The recordings obtained with the cesium glutamate pipette solution were corrected to account for a –10 mV liquid junction potential. The osmolarity of external and internal solutions was 290–310 mosm. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck; IP3 was obtained from Calbiochem. Data are given as mean ± S.E. Genomic Organization of the Murine orai2 Gene—The human ORAI1 sequence (2Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar) was used to identify several ortholog EST clones from mice. These EST clones were in turn used to identify orai2 exons within the murine genome. orai2 sequences were found on chromosome 5G2 and chromosome 16C1. The comparison of EST clones with the genomic locus on chromosome 5 indicated that at least three different transcripts from the orai2 locus arise by alternative splice events (Fig. 1A). Transcripts 1, 2, and 3 represent the murine EST-clones gi16497752, gi27144817, and gi27135608, respectively. Based on this comparison, we also predicted that the orai2 locus of the chromosome 5 consists of at least 5 exons. The start methionine of the 264-amino acid ORAI2 protein was localized in exon 3. Alternative splicing of transcripts derived from the chromosome 5 locus involves the exons 2 and 3. Accordingly, skipping of exon 3 might yield the expression of a N-terminal-truncated version of 250 amino acids, here referred as ORAI2 short (ORAI2S) to distinguish it from the 264-amino acid full-length ORAI2 (ORAI2 long or ORAI2L). By reverse transcription-PCR, the transcripts encoding both ORAI2L and ORAI2S were amplified from murine brain poly(A+) RNA. In addition to the locus on chromosome 5, a second orai2 locus was identified on chromosome 16 (Fig. 1A). The locus on chromosome 16 is intronless and resembles a fusion of exons 1, 4, and 5 of the orai2 locus on chromosome 5. To prove the existence of both loci, we hybridized an exon 5 specific probe to genomic DNA which was restricted by EcoRI. As expected from the restriction analysis of both orai2 loci, two EcoRI fragments of 2.7 and 3.1 kb were detected by Southern analysis (Fig. 1B). Next, we asked whether the orai2 locus of chromosome 16 indeed contains no introns. To answer this question, we used genomic DNA as template and the primers derived from the orai2 exons 4 and 5 for PCR. The exons 4 and 5 of the orai2 locus on chromosome 5 are separated by a 10,536-bp intron (Fig. 1C), and it is therefore unlikely to amplify this DNA under the PCR conditions employed, whereas amplification of a 758-bp fragment is to be expected from the intronless genomic sequence. In fact, this 758-bp fragment was amplified (Fig. 1C), and the sequence of this amplicon differed from the corresponding part of the orai2 locus on chromosome 5 by 4 base pair exchanges (supplemental Fig. 1). Expression of orai2 on chromosome 16 might lead to a protein related to ORAI2S with a single amino acid exchange at position 130 (N130Y). To test whether both orai2 loci are transcriptional active, we cloned 10 individual ORAI2S related cDNAs from reversed transcribed poly(A)+ RNA from murine brain. Sequence comparison of these clones with the murine genome revealed that they arise from chromosome 5 and not from chromosome 16. Furthermore, we analyzed orai2-related EST clones from murine databases and found that they resembled the sequence of the orai2 locus on chromosome 5, indicating that the orai2 locus on chromosome 16 is silent or only expressed to a low extent. Therefore, we suggest that, in mice, orai2 transcripts are primarily derived from chromosome 5. Interestingly, we found two orai2 loci in the rat genome, on chromosome 12 and chromosome 4, whereas in humans, only one orai2 locus is known on chromosome 7 (2Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1867) Google Scholar). Additionally, we found single copy genes of the closely related orai1 and orai3 on the murine chromosomes 5G1 and 7F2–7F3, respectively. Expression of Murine orais and stim1—To compare the tissue expression patterns of orai1, orai2, orai3, and stim1, the full-length cDNAs were cloned from murine tissues and used to probe Northern blots containing poly(A+) RNA of murine tissues and primary cells (Fig. 2). orai1 and stim1 transcripts seemed to be ubiquitously expressed. orai3 transcripts seem to be expressed in the same tissues as orai1 with the exceptions of skeletal muscle and placenta. By contrast, orai2 transcripts are predominantly expressed in brain and to a lower extent in the lung, spleen, and small intestine. Overexpression of Murine ORAI and STIM Proteins—To determine the expression levels of endogenous ORAI and STIM proteins in cell lines usually used for overexpression experiments, we first analyzed the expression of ORAI1 and ORAI2 variants and STIM1 in HEK 293, RBL 2H3, and Jurkat cells using Northern and Western blots (Fig. 3). Transcripts encoding ORAI1 and ORAI2 were readily detected in RBL 2H3 cells and to lesser extent in HEK 293 and Jurkat cells (Fig. 3, A and D). Similarly, the polyclonal antibody detected ORAI2 in RBL 2H3 cells and to a lesser extent in Jurkat cells but not in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3, E and F). The ORAI1 expression was detectable in RBL 2H3 cells but the detection was less obvious in Jurkat and HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, a prominent expression of STIM1 was detected in RBL 2H3 and Jurkat cells and to a lesser extent in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 3G). Concerning the expression of ORAI2, HEK 293 and RBL 2H3 cells provide therefore different backgrounds for the analysis of recombinant channels formed by transfected ORAIs. To define a threshold that allows the detection of ionic currents through recombinant channels, we quantified the background CRAC currents in these cell lines. CRAC current activation was induced by dialysis of 20 μm IP3 under buffer of internal Ca2+ with 10 mm EGTA in the presence of 5 mm external Ca2+. As described previously (21Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar, 22Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., Y.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar), control RBL 2H3 cells displayed CRAC currents with the typical strong inward going rectification and fast activation time course (Fig. 4, E and F). By contrast, it turned out extremely difficult to obtain similar current recordings in control HEK 293 cells. In fact, only 4 out of 13 HEK 293 cells showed inward rectifying currents in the present series of experiments (Fig. 4, A–D). Next, we overexpressed STIM1 in HEK 293 and RBL 2H3 cells to determine the maximal CRAC current densities that the endogenously expressed ORAI proteins can support in these cell lines. The overexpression of STIM1 failed to enhance significantly the density of inward currents in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 5A) but doubled the CRAC current densities in RBL2H3 cells (Fig. 5B). Therefore, HEK 293 cells represent a cell background, in which CRAC currents are hardly detectable even after overexpression of STIM1. CRAC currents of RBL 2H3 cells appear to be readily modulated by the overexpression of STIM1. Under the present experimental conditions, the threshold levels for detection of CRAC currents through recombinant ionic channels formed by ORAI proteins in HEK 293 and RBL 2H3 cells were approximately –1 pA/pF and –4.5 pA/pF, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B).FIGURE 4Overexpression of the murine ORAI1, ORAI2L, ORAI2S, GAM-MA1, and GAMMA2 in two different cell backgrounds. HEK 293 (A–D) and RBL 2H3 (E–H) cells were transfected either with STIM1 alone (S1) or with STIM1 plus ORAI1 (S1 + O1), ORAI2L (S1 + O2L), ORAI2S (S1 + O2S), GAMMA1 (S1 + G1), and GAMMA2 (S1 + G2). Transfected cells that did not express the transfection marker GFP as well as non-transfected cells were used as controls (CTRL). Voltage clamp ramps from +80 to –100 mV were delivered every 2 s to elicit ionic currents. Inward current densities were monitored at –90 mV. The activation of ionic currents was induced with IP3 (20 μm) under buffer of internal Ca2+ (10 mm EGTA) and in the presence of 5 mm external Ca2+. The time courses of inward currents densities (A, C, E, G) show the average development of ionic currents in 4–15 cells per transfection protocol. For clarity, the time courses display only every third data point. The current-voltage relationships (B, D, F, H) show representative recordings obtained 40 s after breakin. The transfection protocols are indicated close to each trace.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Comparison of inward current densities in cells overexpressing murine ORAI, GAMMA, and STIM1 proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2009106846,"Lampreys are one of the two surviving groups of jawless vertebrates, whose ancestors arose more than 540 million years ago. Some species, such as Geotria australis, are anadromous, commencing life as ammocoetes in rivers, migrating downstream to the sea, and migrating back into rivers to spawn. Five photoreceptor types and five retinal cone opsin genes (LWS, SWS1, SWS2, RhA, and RhB) have previously been identified in G. australis. This implies that the ancestral vertebrates possessed photopic or cone-based vision with the potential for pentachromacy. Changes in the morphology of photoreceptors and their spectral sensitivity are encountered during differing aquatic phases of the lamprey lifecycle. To understand the molecular basis for these changes, we characterized the visual pigments and measured the relative levels of opsin expression over two lifecycle phases that are accompanied by contrasting ambient light environments. By expressing recombinant opsins in vitro, we show that SWS1, SWS2, RhA, and RhB visual pigments possess lambda(max) values of 359, 439, 497, and 492 nm respectively. For the LWS visual pigment, we predict a lambda(max) value of 560 nm based on key spectral tuning sites in other vertebrate LWS opsins. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction reveals that the retinal opsin genes of G. australis are differentially regulated such that the visual system switches from a broad sensitivity across a wide spectral range to a much narrower sensitivity centered around 490-500 nm on transition from marine to riverine conditions. These quantitative changes in visual pigment expression throughout the lifecycle may directly result from changes in the lighting conditions of the surrounding milieu."
https://openalex.org/W2071003937,"The major defining pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid beta protein (Abeta), a small peptide derived from beta- and gamma-secretase cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Recent studies have shown that beta- and gamma-secretase activities of BACE1 and presenilin, respectively, are concentrated in intracellular lipid raft microdomains. However, the manner in which APP normally traffics to lipid rafts is unknown. In this study, using transient transfection and immuno-precipitation assays, we show that the cytoplasmic domain of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) interacts with APP and increases Abeta secretion and APP beta-CTF (C-terminal fragment) generation by promoting BACE1-APP interaction. We also employed discontinuous sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to show that the LRP cytoplasmic domain-mediated effect was accompanied by greatly increased localization of APP and BACE1 to lipid raft membranes, where beta- and gamma-secretase activities are highly enriched. Moreover, we provide evidence that endogenous LRP is required for the normal delivery of APP to lipid rafts and Abeta generation primarily in the endocytic but not secretory pathway. These results may provide novel insights to block Abeta generation by targeting LRP-mediated delivery of APP to raft microdomains."
https://openalex.org/W2101208629,"<i>Sulfolobus solfataricus</i> P2 DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4) has been shown to catalyze bypass of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxoG) in a highly efficient and relatively accurate manner. Crystal structures have revealed a potential role for Arg<sup>332</sup> in stabilizing the <i>anti</i> conformation of the 8-oxoG template base by means of a hydrogen bond or ion-dipole pair, which results in an increased enzymatic efficiency for dCTP insertion and makes formation of a Hoogsteen pair between 8-oxoG and dATP less favorable. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace Arg<sup>332</sup> with Ala, Glu, Leu, or His in order to probe the importance of Arg<sup>332</sup> in accurate and efficient bypass of 8-oxoG. The double mutant Ala<sup>331</sup>Ala<sup>332</sup> was also prepared to address the contribution of Arg<sup>331</sup>. Transientstate kinetic results suggest that Glu<sup>332</sup> retains fidelity against bypass of 8-oxoG that is similar to wild type Dpo4, a result that was confirmed by tandem mass spectrometric analysis of full-length extension products. A crystal structure of the Dpo4 Glu<sup>332</sup> mutant and 8-oxoG:C pair revealed water-mediated hydrogen bonds between Glu<sup>332</sup> and the O-8 atom of 8-oxoG. The space normally occupied by Arg<sup>332</sup> side chain is empty in the crystal structures of the Ala<sup>332</sup> mutant. Two other crystal structures show that a Hoogsteen base pair is formed between 8-oxoG and A in the active site of both Glu<sup>332</sup> and Ala<sup>332</sup> mutants. These results support the view that a bond between Arg<sup>332</sup> and 8-oxoG plays a role in determining the fidelity and efficiency of Dpo4-catalyzed bypass of the lesion."
https://openalex.org/W2103079233,"The ErbB-4 receptors are unique in the EGFR/ErbB family for the ability to associate with WW domain-containing proteins. To identify new ligands of the cytoplasmic tail of ErbB-4, we panned a brain cDNA phage library with ErbB-4 peptides containing sequence motifs corresponding to putative docking sites for class-I WW domains. This approach led to identification of AIP4/Itch, a member of the Nedd4-like family of E3 ubiquitin protein ligases, as a protein that specifically interacts with and ubiquitinates ErbB-4 in vivo. Interaction with the ErbB-4 receptors occurs via the WW domains of AIP4/Itch. Functional analyses demonstrate that AIP4/Itch is recruited to the ErbB-4 receptor to promote its polyubiquitination and degradation, thereby regulating stability of the receptor and access of receptor intracellular domains to the nuclear compartment. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the integrity of the ErbB signaling network and mechanistically link the cellular ubiquitination pathway of AIP4/Itch to the ErbB-4 receptor."

We previously constructed 4000 disruptant mutants of Arabidopsis by insertion of Ds transposons. Here, we describe a top-down phenomics approach based on metabolic profiling that uses one-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional 1H,13C NMR analyses and transcriptome analysis of albino mutant lines of Arabidopsis. One-dimensional 1H NMR metabolic fingerprinting revealed global metabolic changes in the albino mutants, notably a decrease in aromatic metabolites and changes in aliphatic metabolites. NMR measurements of plants fed with 13C6-glucose showed that the albino lines had dramatically different 13C-labeling patterns and increased levels of several amino acids, especially Asn and Gln. Microarray analysis of one of the albino lines revealed a unique expression profile and showed that changes in the expression of genes encoding metabolic enzymes did not correspond with changes in the levels of metabolites. Collectively, these results suggest that albino mutants lose the normal carbon/nitrogen balance, presumably mainly through lack of photosynthesis. Our study offers an idea of how much the metabolite network is affected by chloroplast function in plants and shows the effectiveness of NMR-based metabolic analysis for metabolite profiling. On the basis of these findings, we propose that future investigations of plant systems biology combine transcriptomic, metabolomic, and phenomic analyses of gene disruptant lines.

Plants produce energy sources, foods, and industrial or medical materials that are necessary and useful for us. It has been expected to handle the metabolic flows so as to increase the amount of interested chemical resources in plants. For that purpose, comprehensive understanding of the metabolite network is required. Presumably, the metabolite network is regulated by both genetic information and cellular conditions. In recent years, to address the key factors regulating the metabolite network, metabolomics, the nontargeting comprehensive metabolite analysis of plants, has been introduced in plant research as well as other organisms. To elucidate the linkage between genetic information and metabolites, attempts to integrate transcriptome and metabolomics data have been made. Hirai et al. (1Hirai M.Y. Yano M. Goodenowe D.B.

However, such approaches for the primary metabolic pathway did not give us clear information on the regulatory systems, presumably due to higher complexity (1Hirai M.Y. Yano M. Goodenowe D.B.

Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 669-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 19Sweetlove L.J. Last R.L. Fernie A.R. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a large number of gene disruption mutants have been constructed in various plant species, especially Arabidopsis and rice. By taking advantage of these resources, functional genomic approaches can be used to elucidate the function of plant genes (20Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 524-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we described a phenomic approach analyzing the effects of 4000 gene disruptions in Arabidopsis (21Kuromori T. Wada T. Kamiya A. Yuguchi M. Yokouchi T. Imura Y. Takabe H. Sakurai T. Akiyama K. Hirayama T. Okada K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2006; 47: 640-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We found that fewer than 5% of the gene disruptions caused a visible phenotype in the aerial parts, suggesting that a more detailed and practical methodology is needed to determine the effects of losses in gene function. For the purpose of establishing systems biology in plants, we propose the comprehensive analysis of gene disruptant lines by a combination of metabolic fingerprinting using one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy and multidimensional NMR spectroscopy with stable isotope labeling, along with transcriptomic and phenomic analyses. In the current study, we analyzed three Ds transposon insertion mutants of Arabidopsis that display albino phenotype. The albino phenotype is often due to retarded or disrupted chloroplast development. The effects of the loss of chloroplast function on the metabolic pathways, however, have not been previously investigated. Analysis of extracts from albino plants by one-dimensional 1H NMR revealed a unique metabolite profile, and detailed analysis by two-dimensional 13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) 3The abbreviations used are: HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; PLS-DA, partial least-squares discriminant analysis; pTAC, plastid active chromosomal protein; UHR, ultrahigh resolution. spectroscopy allowed the detection of dozens of metabolites, including amino acids. Our results indicate that the albino mutations substantially altered the metabolite profile. Microarray analysis of one of the albino lines revealed a unique pattern of gene expression. We discuss the mechanism of changes in metabolites on the basis of this microarray data and the usefulness of metabolic analysis of disruptant mutants in determining gene functions in plants. Plant Materials and Sample Preparation—Three albino mutants of Arabidopsis were obtained from the RIKEN Biological Resource Center (available on the World Wide Web at rarge.gsc.riken.jp/) (21Kuromori T. Wada T. Kamiya A. Yuguchi M. Yokouchi T. Imura Y. Takabe H. Sakurai T. Akiyama K. Hirayama T. Okada K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2006; 47: 640-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Kuromori T. Hirayama T. Kiyosue Y. Takabe H. Mizukado S. Sakurai T. Akiyama K. Kamiya A. Ito T. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2004; 37: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). One of the parents of the Ds insertion lines, Ds13, was used as the control line (22Kuromori T. Hirayama T. Kiyosue Y. Takabe H. Mizukado S. Sakurai T. Akiyama K. Kamiya A. Ito T. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2004; 37: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The seeds were sterilized in 2.5% NaClO containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min and then washed five times with water. The sterilized seeds were kept for 4 days at 4 °C and then germinated and grown on agar plates containing half-strength Murashige and Skoog medium containing 0.5% glucose or 13C6-glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA). The plates were kept at 23 °C under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. After 3 weeks, ∼8 h into the photoperiod, the aerial parts of 20 plants were harvested randomly and immediately plunged into liquid nitrogen before freeze-drying. NMR samples were prepared essentially as described previously (23Kikuchi J. Hirayama T. Saito K. Dixon R.A. Willmitzer L. Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry, Plant Metabolomics. 57. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2006: 93-101Google Scholar, 24Kikuchi J. Hirayama T. Weckwerth W. Metabolomics: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2006: 273-286Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 mg of the freeze-dried material was extracted with 600 μl of hexafluoro-acetone trideuterate at 50 °C for 5 min with gentle vortexing. After centrifugation, the extracted supernatant was transferred into a 5-mm Ø NMR tube for NMR measurements. One- and Two-dimensional NMR Measurements—One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of unlabeled samples were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 1H inverse probe and a triple-axis gradient. 13C-Labeled plants were compared by both 13C-decoupled and coupled Watergate 1H NMR pulse sequences to assess their incorporation of 13C. Two-dimensional HSQC experiments were performed at 298 K with a Bruker DRU-700 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 1H inverse cryogenically cooled probe with a z axis gradient. A total of 200 complex f1 (13C) and 2048 complex f2 (1H) points were recorded with 36 scans per f1 increment. The spectral widths were 13,381 Hz for f1 and 11,161 Hz for f2. To quantify the signal intensities, a Lorentzian-to-Gaussian window with a Lorentzian line width of 5 Hz and a Gaussian line width of 10 Hz were applied in both dimensions before Fourier transformation. A fifth order polynomial base-line correction was subsequently applied in the f1 dimension. The indirect dimension was zero-filled to 1024 points in the final data matrix. For the 13C-13C coupling analysis, a total of 400 complex f1 points over a spectral width of 7000 Hz was acquired by ultrahigh resolution (UHR) HSQC. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe software (25Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar, 26Kikuchi J. Shinozaki K. Hirayama T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1099-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The 1H and 13C chemical shifts were determined using sodium 2,2′-di-methyl 2-silapentane 5-sulfoxide as a reference. The NMR measurements were repeated three times for each sample. Quantitative Multivariate Analysis of One- and Two-dimensional NMR Spectra—The one-dimensional NMR spectra were integrated between 0.5 and 10.5 ppm over a series of 0.04-ppm integral regions using our custom integration software. After exclusion of the water resonance, each integral region was normalized to the total integral region. Two-dimensional spectral signal assignments were made using our custom software. 4E. Chikayama and J. Kikuchi, unpublished data. These well separated two-dimensional spectral signals, aided by HSQC and our data base of standards, 4E. Chikayama and J. Kikuchi, unpublished data. allowed the accurate identification of major metabolites. The data were analyzed by partial least-squares projection based on the spectral bins obtained from one- and two-dimensional spectral analyses using the pls package (version 2.0) with the “simpls” method running on R software. Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from 3-week-old plants of the control line and albino line 2198 at 6 h after the start of the light period. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol extraction reagent (Invitrogen) and purified with an RNase MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 16 μg of total RNA using a SuperScript double-stranded cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen). The labeled cRNA was synthesized using a BioArray RNA transcript labeling kit (T7) (ENZO Life Sciences, Inc., Farmingdale, NY). After labeling, the cRNA was partially digested by incubating it for 35 min at 94 °C in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 100 mm potassium acetate, and 30 mm magnesium acetate. Microarray hybridization was carried out using 30 μg of cRNA. The hybridization and data detection were performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Affymetrix). The data were normalized by robust multiarray normalization and analyzed using affylmGUI running on R software (27Wettenhall J.M. Simpson K.M. Satterley K. Smyth G.K. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The normalized data were also analyzed by MapMan (28Thimm O. Blasing O. Gibon Y. Nagel A. Meyer S. Kruger P. Selbig J.

Primary array data sets were published in the gene expression and hybridization array data repository of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (Gene Expression Omnibus) (available on the World Wide Web at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) (accession number GSE6788). Metabolite Fingerprinting Based on 1H One-dimensional NMR Spectral Analysis—In addition to T-DNA-tagged and multielement transposon-tagged lines, gene disruption lines generated using transposon-tagging systems based on the maize Activator (Ac)/Dissociation (Ds) system are very useful for genetic studies (30Smith D. Yanai Y. Liu Y.G. Ishiguro S. Okada K. Shibata D. Whittier R.F. Fedoroff N.V. Plant J. 1996; 10: 721-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 31Muskett P.R. Clissold L. Marocco A. Springer P.S. Martienssen R. Dean C. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To help establish systems biology in plants, we propose the systematic analysis of gene-disrupted lines by metabolic fingerprinting using one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy and metabolic profiling by multidimensional NMR spectroscopy with stable isotope labeling, combined with transcriptomic and phenomic analyses (Fig. 1A). We selected three albino mutants (12-2658-1, 13-2198-1, and 15-1824-1) that have single gene disruptions from RIKEN Ds transposon stocks (21Kuromori T. Wada T. Kamiya A. Yuguchi M. Yokouchi T. Imura Y. Takabe H. Sakurai T. Akiyama K. Hirayama T. Okada K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2006; 47: 640-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 22Kuromori T. Hirayama T. Kiyosue Y. Takabe H. Mizukado S. Sakurai T. Akiyama K. Kamiya A. Ito T. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2004; 37: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). We refer to these lines as 2658, 2198, and 1824, respectively. All three mutants had an obvious albino phenotype. Line 2658 was slightly bluish, but the three lines were otherwise nearly indistinguishable (Fig. 1B). The disrupted gene in line 2658 is At1g63970, which encodes 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes the fifth step of the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis (32Hsieh M.H. Goodman H.M. Planta. 2006; 223: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of plastid isoprenoids is essential for chloroplast development and plant growth (32Hsieh M.H. Goodman H.M. Planta. 2006; 223: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Fellermeier M. Raschke M. Sagner S. Wungsintaweekul J. Schuhr C.A. Hecht S. Kis K. Radykewicz T. Adam P.

Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The gene disrupted in line 2198 was At3g04260, which encodes one of the plastid active chromosomal proteins, pTAC3 (35Pfalz J. Liere K. Kandlbinder A. Dietz K.J. Oelmuller R. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 176-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). pTACs are required for transcriptional or posttranscriptional processing of mRNA in plastids. T-DNA insertion mutants of other pTACs, namely pTAC2, pTAC6, and pTAC12, have albino or pale green phenotype (35Pfalz J. Liere K. Kandlbinder A. Dietz K.J. Oelmuller R. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 176-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the albino phenotype of line 2198. In line 1824, At5g08400 was disrupted. Although the function of this gene is still unknown, its gene product is predicted to localize in chloroplasts (36Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Brunak S. von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 1005-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (3638) Google Scholar). The obvious albino phenotype of line 1824 suggests that this gene is important for chloroplast function. We next examined the effect of the albino mutations on the cellular metabolite profile by one-dimensional 1H NMR analysis of the three albino lines and the control line. After plants were grown on plates for 3 weeks, extracts were prepared and analyzed by NMR. We did three biologically replication for each line in one experiment set. There were some clear differences in the one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of the albino lines and the control line (Fig. 2). For example, several signals around 1.0 and 7.0 ppm, which correspond to lipids and aromatic compounds, respectively, were stronger in the spectrum of the control line. On the other hand, many signals between 2.5 and 4.0 ppm, corresponding to organic acids and sugars, were stronger in the spectra of the albino lines. To gain further insight into the metabolic changes caused by the albino mutations, we performed partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). In the PLS-DA, each one-dimensional 1H spectrum between 0.5 and 10.5 ppm was sub-divided into 250 segments of sequential 0.04-ppm regions (segments for the signal from water were removed). Each segment was normalized by the total intensity of the one-dimensional 1H spectrum. PLS-DA allowed differentiation of the different lines (Fig. 2). Components 1 and 2 were clearly different between the albino and control lines. A loading plot showed that chemical shifts around 2.96 and 3.72 ppm and the regions around them made strong positive contributions, and those around 0.96 and 1.32 ppm made negative contributions to component 1 (Fig. 2). These two regions correspond mainly to organic acids and lipids, respectively. For component 2, the regions around 2.96 and 3.72 ppm made positive contributions and that around 2.52, 2.72, and 4.16 ppm made a negative contribution. These results indicate that the albino mutants had a common metabolic phenotype and that the gene malfunctions had different metabolic effects in each mutant although their visible phenotypes were very similar. Metabolite Profiling and Comparison based on 1H,13C HSQC—To obtain more detailed metabolite profiles, we conducted 1H,13C HSQC measurements. For these experiments, plants were labeled with 13C6-glucose according to our previously described methods (23Kikuchi J. Hirayama T. Saito K. Dixon R.A. Willmitzer L. Biotechnology in Agriculture and Forestry, Plant Metabolomics. 57. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2006: 93-101Google Scholar, 24Kikuchi J. Hirayama T. Weckwerth W. Metabolomics: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2006: 273-286Google Scholar). Briefly, each line was grown on medium containing 13C6-glucose. After labeling with 13C6-glucose for 3 weeks, the greening portions of each line were collected and analyzed by NMR. First, we performed 13C decoupling 1H NMR to estimate the labeling efficiency. Photosynthesis dilutes 13C incorporated from the roots with 12C incorporated from CO2. Therefore, we expected to detect the difference of labeling efficiencies between the control and albino lines. The differences between decoupled and coupled spectra were greater in albino lines than in the control line (Fig. S1A). PLS-DA showed a clear separation between the decoupled and coupled data of the albino lines (Fig. S1B). This suggests that the albino lines were labeled more efficiently, as expected. Loading plots identified the peaks that contributed to the discrimination of these samples. Peaks at 2.72, 2.56, and 4.16 ppm and at 2.64, 3.08, 4.08, and 2.24 ppm were prominent in the coupled and decoupled spectra, respectively (Fig. S1C). These peaks correspond to organic acids, such as amino acids. Although it is difficult to assign these peaks, those at 2.64 and 3.08 ppm may originate from Gln and Asn, respectively. These results support the idea that the albino mutations cause drastic changes in the metabolite profiles. We detected many 1H,13C HSQC signals in the samples (Fig. 3). These signals originated from 13C atoms bound to 1Hinthe metabolites. Because there were many peaks with the same 1H chemical shifts, two-dimensional NMR provided better discrimination of the different metabolites. To determine the molecular basis for the effects of mutations or physiological stimuli, it is necessary to know which metabolites change and by how much. Using these clearly separated signals (Fig. 3), our custom program, and data base of chemical shifts for standard metabolites, 4E. Chikayama and J. Kikuchi, unpublished data. we were able to assign 80 peaks from 22 metabolites, including amino acids and sugars (Fig. 4A and Table S1). The assignments were supported by the presence of peaks corresponding to multiple carbon atoms in each metabolite (Table S1).FIGURE 4Summary of two-dimensional HSQC metabolite analysis. A, metabolite changes in the albino mutants. The signal intensities of metabolites in albino lines were normalized by those of the control line. The signal intensities of peaks assigned to Ala β, Arg δ, Asn β, Asp β, Cys α, GABA β, Gln γ, Glu β, Gly α, His β, Ile γ2, Leu δ, Lys β2, Phe β, Pro β, Ser β1, Thr β, Trp α, Val γ1, raffinose-2, succinate, and sucrose-1 were used.

For loadings, only clearly separated spots were assigned.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The assignment of metabolites from PLS-DA based on the 1H,13C HSQC spectra is shown in Fig. 4B. The control and albino samples could again be separated according to component 1, suggesting a unique profile of metabolites in the albino mutants. Asn and Gln were the main contributors to the differences between the albino and control lines. Component 2 separated the albino samples. These results agreed well with those obtained by one-dimensional NMR, and confirmed that the metabolite profiles of the albino and control plants were different. The results also indicated some differences in metabolite profiles among the different albino mutants. We examined the 13C-13C coupling status using UHR HSQC. A typical example of the Asp β and Asn β peaks is shown in Fig. 5. The 13C-13C coupled signals due to Cα and Cγ in both Asp and Asn were stronger in the albino lines than in the control line. All three albino mutants exhibited clear dd couplings, whereas control signals showed a mixture of s, d+1, and d-1 couplings. The Asp β signals, however, appeared to be weaker in the albino lines than in the control line, suggesting that the weak peak strengths for Asp β were caused not by a low labeling efficiency, but rather by a low amount of this compound. Although it is difficult to estimate the precise labeling efficiency from these data, the labeling efficiency in the control line was at least half of those in the albino mutants. Similar results were found for other amino and organic acids. Therefore, the relative amounts of metabolites shown in Fig. 4A are a reasonable reflection of the actual differences in their absolute quantities. It should be noted that the absolute signal strengths were different among experiments. Presumably, the subtle difference in growth conditions, such as humidity, caused such differences (Fig. S2). However, albino samples always showed distinct metabolite profiles. We also prepared plants growing modified media that had only KNO3 for a nitrogen source. The metabolite profiles of albino mutants were different from those described above (Fig. S2). Using these data obtained from different experiment sets, the correlations between detected metabolites were analyzed (Fig. 6). Interestingly, despite the differences in the metabolite levels, high positive correlations among amide amino acids were o"

Here we show that Che-1 is down-regulated during the apoptotic process. We found that the E3 ligase HMD2 physically and functionally interacts with Che-1 and promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal system. Furthermore, we found that in response to apoptotic stimuli Che-1 interacts with the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 and that conformational changes generated by Pin1 are required for Che-1/HDM2 interaction. Notably, a Che-1 mutant lacking the capacity to bind Pin1 exhibits an increased half-life and this correlates with a diminished apoptosis in response to genotoxic stress. Our results establish Che-1 as a new Pin1 and HDM2 target and confirm its important role in the cellular response to DNA damage."

Although both of them can be expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells, the cells are unable to undergo full-scale terminal myogenic differentiation. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) has been found to be functional in the induction of RD cell differentiation, whereas its mechanism is not fully understood. By using quantitative real-time-based chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time reverse transcription-PCR-based promoter activity assays, we examined the activation mechanism of the myogenin gene during TPA-induced differentiation of the RD cells. We have shown that a histone acetyltransferase PCAF and ATPase subunit BRG1 of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex are sequentially recruited to the promoter of the myogenin gene. Both PCAF and BRG1 are also involved in the activation of the myogenin gene. In addition, we have found that the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase is required for BRG1 recruitment in TPA-mediated myogenin induction. We propose that there are two distinct activation steps for the induction of myogenin in TPA-induced early differentiation of RD cells: 1) an early step that requires PCAF activity to acetylate core histones and MyoD to initiate myogenin gene expression, and 2) a later step that requires p38-dependent activity of the SWI/SNF remodeling complex to provide an open conformation for the induction of myogenin.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of childhood that is thought to derive from muscle precursor cells. Rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells are originated from the embryonal type of rhabdomyosarcoma. The RD cells are defective in myogenic differentiation even though they express both MyoD and myogenin (1Bouche M. Senni M.I. Grossi A.M. Zappelli F. Polimeni M. Arnold H.H. Cossu G. Molinaro M. Exp.

Bouche M. Adamo S. Molinaro M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3377-3382PubMed Google Scholar). Several protein kinases including protein kinase Cα, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been implicated in the TPA-induced differentiation of RD cells (3Mauro A. Ciccarelli C. De Cesaris P. Scoglio A. Bouche M. Molinaro M. Aquino A. Zani B.M. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3587-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As one of the excellent paradigms to study cellular differentiation, myogenic differentiation has been extensively studied in the past decade. Much has been learned about the myogenic regulatory factors (MRFs) of the basic helix-loop-helix protein family, such as MyoD, that govern myogenic differentiation. To mediate muscle-specific gene transcription, MRFs have to dimerize with E2A products (i.e. E12 and E47), which are also members of the basic helix-loop-helix. Together, the heterodimers bind efficiently to the consensus E box (i.e. 5′-CANNTG-3′) in the promoter regions of many muscle-specific genes including the myogenin gene. In addition to MRFs, myocytes enhancer binding factor 2 (MEF2s) are also essential for myogenic differentiation (4Black B.L. Olson E.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Four distinct members of the MEF2 family, namely MEF2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D, bind to a consensus AT-rich sequence (i.e. MEF2 site) in promoters of many muscle-specific genes as either homo- or heterodimers. Previous studies showed that a segment of the proximal mouse myogenin gene (–184/+1) containing an E box, a MEF2, and MEF3 sites is ∼88% homologous to that of the humans and is indispensable in myogenin gene expression (5Edmondson D.G.

Myogenin, and other members of the MyoD family (MyoD, Myf5, and MRF4), possess the ability to convert some of the non-muscle cells into the myogenic lineage. Expression of myogenin has been considered as one of the earliest molecular markers for cells committed to differentiation in vitro. Depending on the nature of the stimuli, myogenin is either induced or repressed, this in turn determines whether the differentiation program is enhanced or aborted (7Zhang J.Z. Gao W. Yang H.B. Zhang B. Zhu Z.Y. Xue Y.F. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2661-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is required for myogenin gene expression (8Gerber A.N. Klesert T.R. Bergstrom D.A. Tapscott S.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 436-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 9de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Berkes C.A. Bergstrom D.A. Dacwag C.S. Tapscott S.J. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell.

The SWI/SNF complex depends upon either BRG1 or BRM, the catalytic subunits with ATPase activity, to hydrolyze ATP to alter chromatin conformation. p38 MAPK accelerates myogenic differentiation by activating both MyoD- and MEF2-dependent gene transcription (11Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Puri P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3951-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Recently, p38 MAPK was also shown to be required for the recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex to the myogenin promoter (12Simone C. Forcales S.V. Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N. Latella L. Puri P.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The role of the p38 MAPK here is to phosphorylate BAF60, a component in the SWI/SNF complex, which further recruits the ATPase subunit (BRG1 or BRM) of the complex to the myogenin promoter (12Simone C. Forcales S.V. Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N. Latella L. Puri P.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In addition to the SWI/SNF complex, the histone modification enzymes, such as the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), also participate in remodeling of the chromatin structure by modifying histone tails. p300, CBP, and PCAF of the HAT family are of particular interest because these enzymes cannot only modify the histone tails, but also acetylate other transcription regulatory factors including MyoD and MEF2 (13Puri P.L.

However, it remains unclear which chromatin remodeling factors are involved and how they coordinate with each other in TPA-induced RD cells. To address the above questions, we focused on the epigenetic regulation of the myogenin gene in TPA-treated RD cells. Our data prompted us to propose a two-step model to explain the TPA-induced Myogenin expression in RD cells: an early step in which PCAF is specifically recruited to the myogenin promoter followed by a p38 MAPK-dependent recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex. Our studies provide potential novel drug targets for treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma in the future. Cell Culture—RD cells were purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.37% NaHCO3, and sodium penicillin and streptomycin sulfate (100 units/ml each) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. For inducing differentiation, stock solution of 100 μm TPA in 50% ethanol kept at –20 °C was added with a 1/1,000 dilution to the cultured cells 24 h after plating; equal amount of ethanol without TPA was added to the medium of the control cells. Plasmids—The mammalian expression plasmids were, pcDNA3-HA-p38 (wild type) from Dr. Kun Liang Guan (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor); pcDNA3-antisense p38 from Dr. Gang Pei (SIBS, Chinese Academy of Science); and pBJ5-BRG1(wild type) and pBJ5-BRG1K798R (an ATPase-defective K798R mutant, dominant negative) expression plasmids that were from Dr. Anthony N. Imbalzano (University of Massachusetts Medical School). Reagents—p38 inhibitor SB203580 and TPA were purchased from Sigma. Antibody against p300 was provided by Dr. Q. Li (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Antiserum against hBAF60c was raised in rabbits using the full-length BAF60c as an antigen. Anti-myogenin (F5D), anti-β-actin (I-19), anti-MyoD (M-318), anti-BRG1 (H-88), anti-p38 (H-147), anti-phospho-p38 (D-8), and anti-PCAF (E-8) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against pan-acetyl lysine, acetylated histone H3-K14, and acetylated histone H3-K9 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). DNA Constructs and DNA Transfection—An upstream fragment (–1088/+50) of the mouse myogenin gene was fused upstream of the CAT gene in an expression vector modified in the laboratory of Shen and designated as pREP4m-myog-CAT. The transfection control plasmid pCMV-β-gal was generated by amplifying the β-galactosidase gene from pRSV-β-gal plasmid (constructed in our laboratory) with primer pairs of the 5′ primer: 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTCGTCTGGGACTGGGTG-3′ and the 3′ primer: 5′-GCTCTAGAGGTCGGGATAGTTTTCTTGC-3′, followed by insertion into the XbaI/HindIII-digested pRc/CMV vector (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of DNA into RD cells was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in this study. Expression plasmids of p38 and BRG1 genes were individually co-transfected with pREP4m-myog-CAT and pCMV-β-gal into RD cells. For promoter activity assay, TPA (100 nm) was added to the medium after transient transfection for 16 h and incubated for another 24 h or the time interval indicated followed by cell harvesting. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cells and followed by reverse transcription with a first-strand RT-PCR kit (Promega) per the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with SYBR® Premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Biotech) using the Rotor-Gene RG-3000A (Corbett Research) Real-time PCR System. To detect the induction of the myogenin reporter, the following primers were used: for the myogenin promoter, forward primer, 5′-ACTCTTCGCCCCCGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CCGCCCTGCCACTCAT-3′; for the control plasmid of pCMV-β-gal, forward primer, 5′-CTTACGGCGGTGATTTTGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TGCTGCTGGTGTTTTGCTT-3′. The cycle quantity required to reach a threshold in the linear range (Qt) was determined and compared with a standard curve for each primer set generated by five 3-fold dilutions of the first-strand cDNA of known concentration. Data represent the mean ± S.D. of normalized promoter activities of myogenin relative to that of pCMV-β-gal in each treatment. To quantitate products generated in the chromatin immunoprecipitation assays or mRNA expression, we used the following primers: primers for myogenin gene, 5′-ATGGAGCTGTATGAGACATCCCC-3′ (forward, +1/+23) and 5′-GGACACCGACTTCCTCTTACAC-3′(reverse, +237/+216). The relative expression at each time interval was normalized against GAPDH (5′-GCTCACTGGCATGGCCTTCCG-3′ (forward, +741/+761) and 5′-GTGGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ (reverse, +1050/+1030) using the comparative CT method recommended by the instrument producer. Experiments were repeated at least three times with statistical analyses for each individual experimental set. All values in the experiments were expressed as mean ± S.D. Nuclear Extract, Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—5 × 106 RD cells were collected in 8 ml of culture medium after a different treatment, 32 μl of 0.5 m dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) were immediately added to make a final concentration of 2 mm. After shaking for 5–10 min, glycine was added to a final concentration of 10 mm to stop the cross-linking reaction. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Following repeating this step once more, the pellets were recovered. Nuclear extract preparation was performed as described previously (17Zhang Y. Wang J.S. Chen L.L. Cheng X.K. Heng F.Y. Wu N.H. Shen Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42545-42551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The coimmunoprecipitation assay was carried out by using nuclear extracts (∼500 μg of protein) incubated with 2 μl of specific antibody for 2 h at 4 °C on a shaking platform. 20 μl of Protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz) was added to each tube and incubated at 4 °C overnight. Pellets were recovered, and washed three times with RIPA buffer, followed by adding 40 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 80 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), resuspended and boiled for a 10% SDS-PAGE. Western blot assay was performed as described elsewhere (18Xiao L. Lang W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 400-408PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and Quantitative PCR Analyses—ChIP assays were carried out with formaldehyde cross-linking as previously described (17Zhang Y. Wang J.S. Chen L.L. Cheng X.K. Heng F.Y. Wu N.H. Shen Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42545-42551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Kuo M.H. Allis C.D. Methods. 1999; 19: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar), and detected with PCR and gel electrophoresis. ChIPed DNA was subjected to PCR amplification to yield a positive fragment of 140 bp that was separated on 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Gel images were scanned with an AlphaImager 2000™ as described previously (17Zhang Y. Wang J.S. Chen L.L. Cheng X.K. Heng F.Y. Wu N.H. Shen Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42545-42551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For quantitative assay, standard curve and ChIPed DNA samples were analyzed on a Rotor-Gene RG-3000A Real-time PCR System (Corbett Research, Australia) with PCR Master Mix for SYBR Green assays (TaKaRa, Biotech). Primer pairs used for amplification of the myogenin gene were 5′-GAATCACATCTAATCCACTGTA-3′ (forward, –142/–121) and 5′-ACGCCAACTGCTGGGTGCCA-3′ (reverse, –3/–22). The cycle quantity required to reach a threshold in the linear range (Qt) was determined and compared with a standard curve for the primer set generated by five 10-fold dilutions of genomic DNA samples of known concentration. In all experiments, the following cycling parameters were used: 95 °C for 10 s, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 8 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. The percentage of ChIPed DNA relative to input was calculated and shown as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments. Enhanced Expression of Myogenin in TPA-treated RD Cells—To study the dynamic effect of TPA on RD cells, we treated the cells with TPA for various intervals of time as indicated. After 24–96 h of TPA treatment, the induced RD cells showed morphological changes including elongation of cells and formation of more multinucleated cells (Fig. 1A), which were in agreement with a previous report (2Aguanno S. Bouche M. Adamo S. Molinaro M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 3377-3382PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting and quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays showed that myogenin was present at low levels in non-induced parental RD cells (Fig. 1, B and C). As differentiation progressed, the mRNA and protein levels of myogenin gradually increased and reached a peak value after 12–24 h of TPA treatment. We also analyzed the effect of TPA on promoter activity of the myogenin gene. As shown in Fig. 1D, the activity of the gene was enhanced by 2.9-fold 6 h after TPA treatment and by some 6-fold after 12 h of TPA treatment. A similar pattern of TPA-induced myogenin mRNA expression (Fig. 1C) suggested that the myogenin gene is mainly regulated at the promoter level in TPA-treated RD cells. Enhanced Histone Acetylation at the Promoter Region of Myogenin in TPA-induced RD Cells—To uncover the mechanism by which TPA promotes differentiation of RD cells, we first examined the acetylation status of lysines 9 and 14 in histone H3 (i.e. H3-K9 and H3-K14) as these residues are related to the activation status of the local chromatin (20Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7702) Google Scholar). ChIP assays were performed. Sonicated chromosome fragments were pulled down with specific antibodies against acetylated H3-K9 and H3-K14, respectively, followed by real-time PCR analysis using primers in the 5′-flanking region of the myogenin gene. We found that whereas K9 and K14 showed limited acetylation in the first 3 h of TPA induction, the acetylation of K14 reached to a higher level at 6 h post-treatment (Fig. 2B). Eventually both sites were significantly acetylated in RD cells after 12 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 2, A and B). The enhanced acetylation of histone H3 shown here indicated that HATs are involved in the early stage of TPA treatment. PCAF Is the First Histone Acetyltransferase Recruited to the Myogenin Promoter after TPA Treatment—To determine which HAT is preferentially recruited to the myogenin promoter in response to TPA treatment, we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Interestingly, we found that both p300 and MyoD consistently associated with the myogenin promoter with or without TPA induction (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PCAF was gradually recruited to the promoter only after 6 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 3A). A quantitative analysis was shown in Fig. 3B. As PCAF is known to interact with and acetylate MyoD (15Sartorelli V. Puri P.L. Hamamori Y. Ogryzko V. Chung G. Nakatani Y. Wang J.Y. Kedes L. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), we next tested whether this event occurred in TPA-treated RD cells. We found that: 1) PCAF started to accumulate in the nucleus of RD cells after 6 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 3C, top panel); 2) PCAF directly interacts with MyoD, a key regulator of myogenin gene, and vice versa (Fig. 3C, second and third panels); and 3) MyoD was acetylated after 6 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 3C, bottom panel). These results suggested that PCAF is likely responsible for acetylation of both histones (e.g. H3-K9 and H3-K14) and MyoD in the early stage of TPA-induced RD cells. SWI/SNF Complex Is Recruited to the Myogenin Promoter at a Later Stage in TPA-treated RD Cells—To examine whether the TPA-induced expression of myogenin requires the participation of other chromatin remodeling molecules, we focused on the mammalian SWI/SNF complex as it has been implicated in myogenin gene expression (9de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Berkes C.A. Bergstrom D.A. Dacwag C.S. Tapscott S.J. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3997-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 10de la Serna I.L. Carlson K.A. Imbalzano A.N. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Although either BRG1 or Brm could function as the catalytic subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex, only Brg1 was found to be present in RD cells (Fig. 4B, and data not shown). Expression constructs of the wild type BRG1 (wtBRG1), its dominant negative mutant (dnBRG1), and an empty vector were individually co-transfected with the myogenin reporter plasmid and pCMV-β-gal. Although the wtBRG1 slightly increased the TPA-induced myogenin promoter activity, the dominant-negative BRG1 drastically abolished the TPA induction of the gene to the basal level without affecting the constitutive promoter activity of the gene (Fig. 4A). By immunoprecipitation and Western blotting, we found that BAF60 physically interacted with Brg1 only after 12 h of TPA induction (Fig. 4B, top row). In addition, we showed by ChIP assays that BAF60 was efficiently recruited to the promoter region of myogenin in RD cells only after 12 h of TPA induction and that its levels reached a plateau after 24–48 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 4C). Our results suggested that Brg1 is recruited to the myogenin promoter via BAF60 and participates in regulation of the myogenin gene during TPA-induced RD cell differentiation. p38 Is Activated by TPA and Plays a Pivotal Role in TPA-induced Myogenin Expression—The p38 MAPK pathway plays an essential role in muscle cell differentiation (11Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Puri P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3951-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that p38 MAPK promotes myogenic differentiation by controlling the recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex to the myogenin promoter (12Simone C. Forcales S.V. Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N. Latella L. Puri P.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To test whether p38 MAPK is also involved in TPA-induced myogenin gene expression, we employed SB203580 (SB), a specific inhibitor for p38 MAPK. We showed that SB blocked the TPA-induced myogenin expression in RD cells (Fig. 5A). In contrast, basal levels of myogenin expression were insensitive to SB203580. In addition, we found that the protein levels of p38 in both the nucleus and whole cell extracts were enhanced by TPA treatment. Most importantly, the levels of the dually phosphorylated p38 MAPK (i.e. the active form of p38) were also enhanced after 3 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 5B). Similar results were also obtained from analysis of the myogenin promoter activity in response to TPA treatment. We found that SB effectively reduced the TPA-induced myogenin activity back to the basal levels (Fig. 5C). In addition, the p38 antisense construct also completely repressed the TPA-induced promoter activity of myogenin to the basal levels in RD cells (Fig. 5D). In contrast, the wild-type p38 had no obvious effect. These results confirmed that p38 is indispensable for TPA-induced myogenin induction in RD cells. Because p38 is known to target the SWI/SNF complex to the myogenin promoter in normal myogenic differentiation, we next examined whether a similar mechanism also worked in TPA-induced RD cells. ChIP assays were performed with or without the p38 inhibitor SB. We found that recruitment of Brg1 to the myogenin promoter was detectable only after 12 h of TPA treatment (Fig. 5E). Importantly, the recruitment of Brg1 was completely dependent on p38 MAPK, in agreement with the findings by Simone et al. (12Simone C. Forcales S.V. Hill D.A. Imbalzano A.N. Latella L. Puri P.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In contrast, recruitment of PCAF in response to TPA induction was not affected by SB203580 treatment. The quantitative analysis was shown in Fig. 5E, FA and FB. We have shown that p300 constitutively associates with the myogenin promoter in RD cells independent of TPA treatment (Fig. 3A). In contrast, PCAF is recruited to the myogenin promoter in a TPA-inducible manner (Figs. 3A and 5D). As the binding of PCAF to the myogenin promoter correlates with the increase in acetylation of H3-K9, H3-K14, and MyoD (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3B), it suggests that PCAF is likely the HAT that acetylates both histones and MyoD at the early stage of TPA action. Although p300 is also capable of acetylating MyoD (21Polesskaya A. Duquet A. Naguibneva I. Weise C. Vervisch A. Bengal E. Hucho F. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34359-34364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Polesskaya A. Naguibneva I. Fritsch L. Duquet A. Ait-Si-Ali S. Robin P. Vervisch A. Pritchard L.L. Cole P. Harel-Bellan A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6816-6825Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), it is less likely responsible for MyoD acetylation in RD cells as both p300 and MyoD already associate with the myogenin promoter before TPA induction. However, MyoD is not acetylated until PCAF is recruited into the complex. As both p300 and PCAF can physically associate with each other (23Yang X.J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar), it raises the interesting possibility that p300 facilitates TPA-induced PCAF recruitment to the myogenin promoter. Whether this is indeed the case remains to be further explored. In addition, it remains unclear how TPA induces PCAF recruitment to the myogenin promoter. Further investigation is needed to address this issue. Regarding the sequential recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex, our chromatin immunoprecipitation data clearly demonstrated that the mammalian SWI/SNF complex represented by Brg1 is also recruited to the myogenin promoter with another 6-h delay after PCAF recruitment. Presumably, an earlier recruitment of PCAF functions to acetylate both histones and MyoD, which facilitates subsequent recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex. This is consistent with a general mode of action for the SWI/SNF complex, as the SWI/SNF complex in different biological systems is normally recruited to local promoter regions after these regions are pre-acetylated by HATs (9de la Serna I.L. Ohkawa Y. Berkes C.A. Bergstrom D.A. Dacwag C.S. Tapscott S.J. Imbalzano A.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3997-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the SWI/SNF complex, BAF60c appears to associate with the myogenin promoter earlier than the BRG1, as BAF60 can be detected to associate with the myogenin promoter as early as 6 h after TPA induction (Fig. 4C). In addition, we found that BAF60 directly interacts with MyoD (data not shown). Based on these data, we suggest that the SWI/SNF complex is recruited to the myogenin promoter via BAF60. Whether the interaction between MyoD and BAF60 is essential in the recruitment of SWI/SNF complex remains to be established. It has been reported that the p38 pathway in RD cells is defective, which could be responsible for the inability of the cells toward differentiation (11Wu Z. Woodring P.J. Bhakta K.S. Tamura K. Wen F. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Puri P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3951-3964Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 24Puri P.L. Wu Z. Zhang P. Wood L.D. Bhakta K.S. Han J. Feramisco J.R. Karin M. Wang J.Y. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 574-584PubMed Google Scholar). As the malfunction of defective p38 can be overcome by an ectopic constitutively active mutant of MKKK6 (7Zhang J.Z. Gao W. Yang H.B. Zhang B. Zhu Z.Y. Xue Y.F. Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2661-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which indicates target elements in the downstream of p38 are not involved in the defect differentiation of RD cells. By using SB to inhibit the activity of p38, we have found that TPA-induced promoter activity of myogenin is abolished, whereas the basal expression remain unaffected. Meanwhile, Brg1 recruitment at the promoter region of the myogenin gene is also repressed by SB after 12–24 h of treatment. These results indicate that p38 activity is essential for an open chromatin conformation on the TPA-induced expression of the myogenin gene. However, the direct target(s) of p38 MAPK in TPA-treated RD cells remains to be explored. Collectively, the timing for each individual regulator such as PCAF or BRG1 to bind to or modify the myogenin promoter occurred strictly at either 6 or 12 h of TPA treatment. We thus propose that there are two distinct activation steps for the induction of myogenin in the early stage of TPA-induced RD cell differentiation. First, an early step that requires PCAF activity to provide acetylation on core histones and MyoD to initiate myogenin gene expression. Second, a later oriented step, in which p38 dependent activity of the SWI/SNF remodeling complex is required to provide an open conformation for the induction of myogenin in the TPA-treated RD cells. Our studies reveal an essential role for epigenetic regulation in TPA-induced differentiation of RD cells and provide potential drug targets for future treatment of the rhabdomyosarcoma.

A key event in prion diseases is the conversion of the cellular, host-encoded prion protein (PrPC) to its abnormal isoform PrPSc predominantly in the central nervous system of the infected host (1Aguzzi A. Polymenidou M. Cell. 2004; 116: 313-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that the major and possibly only component of the infectious agent is PrPSc or a PrP folding intermediate (2Legname G. Baskakov I.V. Nguyen H.O.B. Riesner D. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 2004; 305: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). PrPC is a cell surface-anchored glycoprotein of a not well characterized function (3Harris D.A. Br. Med. Bull. 2003; 66: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). PrPSc is derived from PrPC in a posttranslational process that appears to involve PrPC-PrPSc molecular interactions (4Horiuchi M. Caughey B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The crucial role of PrPC expression for prion infection and PrPSc formation has been demonstrated in transgenic mice with an ablated PrP gene (5Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Since then transgenic animals have been used extensively to unravel the influence of specific PrP amino acid residues or domains on prion susceptibility (6Scott M. Groth D. Foster D. Torchia M.

Although these hallmark experiments added important information to prion biology (12Weissmann C. Flechsig E. Br. Med. Bull. 2003; 66: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), generation of transgenic animals is laborious and expensive and, thus, not suited for testing broad sets of PrP mutants. Alternative cell culture models for prion diseases have greatly helped us to understand the molecular mechanism of PrPSc formation (13Caughey B. Br. Med.

However, so far comparative studies on the direct influence of PrP alterations on the prion infection process (as opposed to studies in persistently infected cell cultures) were mainly restricted to transgenic animal models (6Scott M.

Weissmann C. Neuron. 2000; 27: 399-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). One reason for this is that all so-far-identified cell lines susceptible to prions code for endogenous wild-type PrP. Therefore endogenous PrP might be co-expressed with the exogenous PrP of interest during infection experiments (24Race R.E. Caughey B. Graham K. Ernst D. Chesebro B. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 2845-2849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schatzl H.M. Laszlo L. Holtzman D.M. Tatzelt J. DeArmond S.J. Weiner R.I. Mobley W.C. Prusiner S.B. J.

Thus, successful infection could still be supported by endogenous PrP expression rather than by transgenic PrP. Furthermore, it was unclear whether ectopic PrPSc by itself could initiate the conformational change of subsequent PrPC molecules in the absence of endogenous wild-type PrPSc molecules. Recent progress has been made by the finding that rabbit kidney epithelial cells RK13 expressing low or undetectable levels of endogenous rabbit PrP can be rendered permissive to sheep scrapie by ectopic expression of sheep PrP (26Vilette D. Andreoletti O. Archer F. Madelaine M.F. Vilotte J.L. Lehmann S. Laude H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4055-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although this model elegantly showed that this cell line can be infected by scrapie originating from another species, its usefulness in testing broader sets of PrP mutants was somewhat limited in that PrP-positive clones had to be selected before infection studies could be performed (28Sabuncu E. Petit S. Le Dur A. Lan L.T. Vilotte J.L. Laude H. Vilette D. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 2696-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because of the fact that these cells code for PrP, endogenous PrP expression cannot be absolutely ruled out. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a novel cell culture system based on PrP0/0 cells that (a) allows for the generation of transgenic PrPSc in the absence of any endogenous wild-type PrP and (b) enables us to easily test broad sets of PrP mutants for their influence on the prion infection process and PrPSc formation. Here we have identified a permanent hippocampus-derived PrP0/0 cell line termed HpL3-4 (29Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) that becomes susceptible to mouse-adapted scrapie upon ectopic expression of murine PrPC. Stable expression of exogenous PrP can be initiated fast and efficiently in a high percentage of cells without selection of PrPC-positive clones, and the infection of cells leads to release of prion infectivity into the cell culture supernatant. We have used our cell culture model to study the influence of sheep PrP amino acid residues in mouse PrP on 22L infection and identified several amino acid residue substitutions that drastically influenced PrPSc formation. Interestingly, alterations of amino acid residues known to be absolutely critical for efficient transmission of sheep-derived scrapie to sheep also drastically influenced PrPSc formation by mouse-adapted scrapie strain 22L, suggesting that these PrP positions were critical for the adaptation of scrapie strain 22L from sheep to mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that certain residues located on the outer surfaces of helix 2 and 3 in PrPC critically affect conversion to PrPSc, whereas residues pointing inward do not. These results have mechanistic relevance, as they comply with the predicted structure of PrPSc multimers and suggest that amino acids protruding from the second and third helix might critically affect inter- or intramolecular stacking of PrPSc molecules. Thus, we provide novel insights in how PrPC and PrPSc interact and in the surfaces of PrPSc responsible for the formation of the PrPSc aggregate. Construction of Retroviral Expression Vectors and Transduction of HpL3-4 Cells with Retroviral Particles—The coding regions of wild-type and mutated mouse PrP genes were ligated into the retroviral expression vector pSFF (30Bestwick R.K. Kozak S.L. Kabat D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5404-5408Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 31Miller A.D. Buttimore C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 32Mann R. Mulligan R.C. Baltimore D. Cell. 1983; 33: 153-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Single point mutations were inserted into mouse PrP by PCR site-directed mutagenesis, and sequences were verified. The vector pSFF was transfected into a mixed culture of Ψ2 and PA317 cells, and retroviral particles were harvested once cells were ∼80–100% positive for PrP. Supernatants were cleared from cell debris (120 × g, 4 °C, 10 min). 3 × 105 HpL3-4 cells were plated in 6-well plates. The next day cells were incubated with 4 μg/ml Polybrene for 2 h before exposure to 1 ml of retroviral particles overnight. Phosphatidylinositol-specific Phospholipase C (PI-PLC) Treatments and Flow Cytometry Analysis—For PI-PLC treatments, cells were grown to confluence on 6-cm dishes. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS, and 1 ml of new medium without FCS was added. Cells were either incubated with 4 μl PI-PLC (Sigma-Aldrich) or without PI-PLC for 8 h. Medium was harvested and cleared twice by centrifugation. Proteins were CH3OH-pecipitated. The whole sample was loaded. Cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed in lysis buffer according to standard procedures (see above). Cleared cell lysates were CH3OH-precipitated, and 1/10 of the sample was loaded. PrP was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4. For detection of PrP cell surface expression by flow cytometry analysis, cells were detached using PBS, 1 mm EDTA. Cells were fixed in PBS, 2.5% FCS, and 0.05% sodium azide and subsequently incubated with anti-PrP antibody 4H11 (1:100) (33Nunziante M. Kehler C. Maas E. Kassack M.U. Groschup M. Schatzl H.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4959-4973Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for 45 min on ice. Cells were rinsed in PBS, 2.5% FCS, and 0.05% sodium azide, and Cy2-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Dianova) was added (1:100) for 45 min. Rinsed cells were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Cell Infections—The PrP0/0 hippocampus-derived cell line HpL3-4 was described previously (29Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These cells express a marker of a neuronal-precursor cell lineage, neurofilament NF-68K (29Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Scrapie strain 22L was kindly provided by Dr. Suzette A. Priola, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, MT (27Vorberg I. Raines A. Story B. Priola S.A. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The titer of the 22L strain was 2 × 108.5 ID50/g of infected brain. 10% brain homogenates were prepared in PBS, and cell infections were performed as previously described (27Vorberg I. Raines A. Story B. Priola S.A. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 104 HpL3-4 cells were plated in 24-well dishes 1 day before infection. Medium was removed and replaced by 0.2 ml of 1% scrapie brain homogenate diluted into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. This equals a total dose of infectivity of ∼1.26 × 106 ID50 and an estimated multiplicity of infection of 25.2. Four hours later, 0.6 ml medium was added, and the cells incubated for an additional 68 h. Cells were then expanded into 6-cm (passage 1) and 10-cm dishes (passage 2). Passage 3 was tested for its PrPSc content. Cells were subsequently passaged at a ratio of 1:10. Transfer of Prion Infectivity by Medium Transfer—Cell culture supernatant from confluent HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP cells persistently infected with the 22L scrapie strain (cell culture passage number post-scrapie infection: 37) was harvested and transferred through a 0.2-μm Millipore filter to clear the supernatant from any cell contaminants. During the course of the experiment, both 22L scrapie strain donor and acceptor cells were grown on 10-cm dishes supplemented with 10 ml of medium. Subconfluent acceptor cells were incubated with 10 ml of donor cell culture supernatant. The following day 5 ml of the medium was replaced by fresh medium, and the cells were grown for an additional 2 days until confluent. Acceptor cells were split 1:10 and exposed to donor cell culture medium the following days as described above. Treatment was performed for seven passages total. Subsequently, cells were passaged every 3–4 days at a ratio 1:10 in the presence of fresh medium. Detection of PrPSc by Western Blot—PrPSc in cell cultures was detected as described previously (34Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Groschup M.H. Nunziante M. Lucassen R. Spielhaupter C. Muranyi W. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schatzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). PrP was detected by the mouse monoclonal antibodies 3F4 (35Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by use of enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). For determination of the amount of cells producing PrPSc, cells were cloned as described previously (36Vorberg I. Raines A. Priola S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29218-29225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Bioassays—For preparation of inocula, cells were exposed to 1.26 × 106 ID50 of 22L and passaged 14 (HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP) or 11 times (HpL3-4), respectively. Prion-infected cells were passaged 12 of 14 times at a ratio 1:10 (see “Cell Infections” above). Cells of passage 14 or 11 were counted (1.9 × 107 HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP infected, 1.5 × 107 HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP uninfected per 10-cm dish). 1/63 of the infected cells equaling 3 × 105 cells were injected per mouse. Thus, each mouse was theoretically injected with 2 × 10–8 ID50 of original inoculum. Cells were suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FCS. After subsequent freeze-thaw cycles, cell suspensions were passaged through 20- and 24-gauge needles. Lysates and control brain homogenates were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min, and 30 μl of cell lysate was injected intracranially into 6–8-week-old tga20 mice. These mice overexpress wild-type mouse PrPC and have previously been shown to succumb to scrapie with substantially shortened incubation times compared with wild-type mice (22Fischer M. Rulicke T. Raeber A. Sailer A. Moser M. Oesch B. Brandner S. Aguzzi A. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Mice were regularly checked for the onset of neurological symptoms, and mice showing signs of disease were sacrificed. Efficient Transduction of Hippocampus-derived PrP-deficient Cell Line HpL3-4 with Retrovirus Coding for 3F4 Epitope-tagged PrP—Several cell lines have been generated from PrP0/0 mice; however, susceptibility to prion infection upon ectopic expression of prion protein has not been demonstrated. For fast, efficient, and stable expression of cellular prion protein in the PrP knock-out cells, a retroviral expression system was utilized (36Vorberg I. Raines A. Priola S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29218-29225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The hippocampal cell line HpL3-4 derived from PrP0/0 mice (29Kuwahara C. Takeuchi A.M. Nishimura T. Haraguchi K. Kubosaki A. Matsumoto Y. Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Yokoyama T. Itohara S. Onodera T. Nature. 1999; 400: 225-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) was transduced with retroviral particles coding for murine PrP tagged with the epitope for the monoclonal antibody 3F4 (Mo3F4 PrP). This epitope can be introduced into murine PrP by the substitution of two amino acid residues at positions L108M and V111M (37Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and allows for the discrimination of de novo formed PrPSc from PrPSc present in the inoculum (36Vorberg I. Raines A. Priola S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29218-29225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of cells harvested 10 passages after transduction revealed that transduced cells expressed high amounts of Mo3F4 PrP (Fig. 1A). To determine the percentage of cells that were transduced by the retroviral particles and expressed Mo3F4 PrP persistently, transduced cells were passaged 14 or 69 times, respectively, before single cell clones were isolated and tested for Mo3F4 PrP expression (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of cell lysates from transduced clones isolated after 14 or 69 passages demonstrated that 96.3 and 97.6% of the cells expressed epitope-tagged PrPC, respectively. Thus, transduction of HpL3-4 cells with retrovirus yields a nearly homogenous population of cells stably expressing recombinant PrP over multiple cell culture passages. Mo3F4 PrP Expression Renders HpL3-4 Cells Susceptible to Mouse-adapted Scrapie—Prion infection and disease pathology in vivo are strictly dependent on the expression of cellular prion protein (5Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A. Greiner R.A. Autenried P. Aguet M. Weissmann C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1339-1347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). However, in vitro, PrPC expression is not the only prerequisite for prion infection (36Vorberg I. Raines A. Priola S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29218-29225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and susceptible cell lines can only be determined empirically (27Vorberg I. Raines A. Story B. Priola S.A. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To test if hippocampal HpL3-4 cells can be rendered permissive to mouse-adapted scrapie by ectopic expression of epitope-tagged PrP, cells were exposed to scrapie strain 22L (Fig. 2), a strain that has been shown to be capable of infecting a variety of different cell lines (27Vorberg I. Raines A. Story B. Priola S.A. J. Infect. Dis. 2004; 189: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 38Nishida N. Harris D.A. Vilette D. Laude H. Frobert Y. Grassi J. Casanova D. Milhavet O. Lehmann S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 39Milhavet O. McMahon H.E. Rachidi W. Nishida N. Katamine S. Mange A. Arlotto M. Casanova D. Riondel J. Favier A. Lehmann S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13937-13942Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). As a control, HpL3-4 cells not expressing PrP were also incubated with 22L scrapie brain homogenate (Fig. 2A, lane 2). Wild-type and transduced HpL3-4 cells not exposed to scrapie brain homogenate were concomitantly cultured to demonstrate that cells do not per se accumulate PrPSc (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3). Western blot analysis demonstrated that a faint 3F4 antibody-positive PrPSc signal was already apparent after ∼3 passages post-scrapie inoculation in HpL3-4 cells stably expressing 3F4 epitope-tagged PrP that were exposed to scrapie brain homogenate (data not shown). Ten passages post-inoculation, cells still tested positive for PrPSc (Fig. 2A, right panel). Thus, ectopic expression of murine PrP rendered HpL3-4 cells susceptible to the mouse-adapted scrapie strain 22L. The fact that HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP cells generated proteinase K-resistant PrP over multiple passages strongly argues that the cells are chronically infected with mouse-adapted prion strain 22L. To confirm production of infectivity, lysates of cells harvested 14 passages post-infection were inoculated intracranially into tga20 mice. A late passage number was chosen to guarantee dilution of potential residual inoculum present in the cell culture. Passaging of cells resulted in a theoretical dilution of at least 6.3 × 1013 of the original inoculum (see “Experimental Procedures”). Because a total of 1.26 × 106 ID50 were used for infection, inoculum should be completely diluted out. As controls, 1% brain homogenate of a terminally sick mouse infected with 22L scrapie as well as HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP cells exposed to brain homogenate from a healthy mouse were inoculated (passage 11 post-exposure) (Table 1). Mice inoculated with 22L scrapie brain homogenate or lysates of cells inoculated with 22L showed signs of scrapie disease ∼80 days and 116 days post-infection, respectively, and were sacrificed. Thus, we have shown for the first time that brain-derived PrP0/0 cells can be rendered susceptible to scrapie infection by ectopic expression of mouse PrP and produce infectivity over multiple passages. Furthermore, our data are consistent with the finding that ectopic expression of PrP in transgenic mice with an ablated PrP gene can be rendered susceptible to prion infection.TABLE 1Production of scrapie infectivity in HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP cells exposed to scrapie strain 22LScrapie strainInoculum (brain homogenate or cell lysate)Clinical scrapie/totalIncubation time ± S.D.NoneHpL3-4 Mo34 PrP cells0/5aOne mouse died of pneumonia 201 days post-infection and was excluded from the analysis.>28022LBrain homogenate (1%)6/680.3 ± 2.622LHpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP cells6/6116 ± 4.5a One mouse died of pneumonia 201 days post-infection and was excluded from the analysis. Open table in a new tab Gradual Increase in PrPSc-positive Cells upon Continuous Passage Suggests Spread of Infection in Cell Culture—To estimate if continuous passage of cells leads to an increase in PrPSc-producing cells, persistently infected cells were passaged 14 and 69 times and subsequently cloned for isolation of single cell clones. Testing of cell clones revealed that 15.5% of the clones expressing Mo3F4 PrP tested positive for PrPSc production upon 14 passages (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, 60% of the 3F4-positive clones isolated after 69 passages post-infection accumulated PrPSc (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that the scrapie strain 22L is capable of spreading in HpL3-4 cell cultures ectopically expressing PrP. Persistently Infected HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP Cells Release Infectivity into the Cell Culture Medium—It has previously been shown that spread of scrapie infectivity can occur by release of infectivity into the cell culture supernatant (25Schatzl H.M.

However, other studies report that spread of infectivity is dependent on cell to cell contact (41Kanu N. Imokawa Y. Drechsel D.N. Williamson R.A. Birkett C.R. Bostock C.J. Brockes J.P. Curr.

Thus, it is possible that the mechanism of prion transmission between cells can vary depending on the prion strain or the cell line (42Paquet S. Langevin C. Chapuis J. Jackson G.S. Laude H. Vilette D. J. Gen. Virol. 2007; 88: 706-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test if infectivity could spread to uninfected cells in a HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP cell culture via cell culture supernatant, uninfected HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP cells were exposed to cell culture medium from scrapie-infected HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP donor cells. Treatment was performed for seven passages followed by subsequent cell culture passages in fresh medium. In parallel, uninfected HpL3-4 Mo3F4 PrP cells were also subsequently passaged in the absence of donor cell culture medium. Interestingly, very faint PrPSc signals were detectable by Western blot upon treatment of cells for three passages ("

Using purified Escherichia coli-expressed CTP synthetase 1 as a substrate, protein kinase C activity was time- and dose-dependent and dependent on the concentrations of ATP and CTP synthetase 1. The protein kinase C phosphorylation of the recombinant enzyme was accompanied by a 95-fold increase in CTP synthetase 1 activity. Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analyses showed that CTP synthetase 1 was phosphorylated on multiple serine and threonine residues. The induction of PKC1R398A-encoded protein kinase C resulted in a 50% increase for human CTP synthetase 1 phosphorylation in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ura7Δ ura8Δ mutant lacking yeast CTP synthetase activity. Synthetic peptides that contain the protein kinase C motif for Ser462 and Thr455 were substrates for mammalian protein kinase C, and S462A and T455A mutations resulted in decreases in the extent of CTP synthetase 1 phosphorylation that occurred in vivo. Phosphopeptide mapping analysis of S. cerevisiae-expressed CTP synthetase 1 mutant enzymes phosphorylated with mammalian protein kinase C confirmed that Ser462 and Thr455 were phosphorylation sites. The S. cerevisiae-expressed and purified S462A mutant enzyme exhibited a 2-fold reduction in CTP synthetase 1 activity, whereas the purified T455A mutant enzyme exhibited a 2-fold elevation in CTP synthetase 1 activity (Choi, M.-G., and Carman, G.M. (2006) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 5367–5377). These data indicated that protein kinase C phosphorylation at Ser462 stimulates human CTP synthetase 1 activity, whereas phosphorylation at Thr455 inhibits activity.

CTP synthetase (EC 6.3.4.2, UTP-ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)) is an allosterically regulated enzyme that is essential for the growth and metabolism of all organisms (1Stryer L. Biochemistry.Fourth Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1995Google Scholar). The essential nature of the enzyme stems from the fact that its reaction product CTP is required for the synthesis of RNA, DNA, and membrane phospholipids (1Stryer L. Biochemistry.Fourth Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1995Google Scholar). CTP synthetase activity controls the balance of nucleotide pools (2Aronow B. Ullman B. J. Biol.

Some of this phosphorylation is mediated by protein kinase A (52Han G.-S. Sreenivas A. Choi M.G. Chang Y.F. Martin S.S. Baldwin E.P. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5367-5377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present work we addressed the hypothesis that phosphorylation of human CTP synthetase 1 was also mediated by protein kinase C. This hypothesis is based on the presence of potential protein kinase C target sites in the CTP synthetase 1 enzyme (Fig. 1). We showed here that mammalian protein kinase C does in fact phosphorylate purified human CTP synthetase 1. Ser462 and Thr455 were identified as major protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation at Ser462 results in the stimulation of CTP synthetase 1 activity, whereas phosphorylation at Thr455 results in the inhibition of activity. This work identifies an important human target of protein kinase C and advances the understanding of human CTP synthetase 1 regulation by phosphorylation. Materials—All chemicals were reagent grade.

Many leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1 (LAD-1) mutations disrupt the expression and function of β2 integrins. Herein, we further characterized the LAD-1 mutation N329S in the β2 inserted (I)-like domain. This mutation converted αLβ2 from a resting into a high affinity conformer because αLβ2N329S transfectants adhered avidly to ligand intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-3 in the absence of additional activating agent. An extended open conformation is adopted by αLβ2N329S because of its reactivity with the β2 activation reporter monoclonal antibodies MEM148 and KIM127. A corresponding mutation inβ3 generated constitutively activeαIIbβ3 that adhered to fibrinogen. This Asn is conserved in all human β subunits, and it resides before the last helix of the I-like domain, which is known to be important in activation signal propagation. By mutagenesis studies and review of existing integrin structures, we conjectured that this conserved Asn may have a primary role in shaping the I-like domain by stabilizing the conformation of theα7 helix and the β6-α7 loop in the I-like domain.

The integrins are type I membrane cell adhesion molecules formed non-covalently by two subunits (α/β). Despite having no intrinsic enzymatic properties, integrins are bidirectional signal transducers brought about by the recruitment of cytosolic proteins, many of which are signaling proteins, to their relatively short cytoplasmic tails (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). Structural data reveal a composite of distinct domains and folds found in an integrin molecule (2Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 3Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). Out of the 24 human integrins, nine contain in the α subunit an additional inserted (I) domain that is the primary ligand-binding domain of these integrins (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). The I domain has a metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) 3The abbreviations used are: MIDAS, metal ion-dependent adhesion site; ADMIDAS, adjacent to MIDAS; LIMBS, ligand-induced metal-binding site; ICAM, intercellular adhesion molecule; LAD-1, leukocyte adhesion deficiency-1; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; I, inserted; EI, expression index; PDB, Protein Data Bank. that contains a divalent cation essential for ligand binding. Integrins that lack the I domain (henceforth referred to as I-less integrins) are found to bind ligand via the β propeller of their α subunit and the I-like domain of their β subunit (2Arnaout M.A. Mahalingam B. Xiong J.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2005; 21: 381-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 3Luo B.H. Carman C.V. Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 619-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1247) Google Scholar). The I-like domain is found in all integrin β subunits, and it is structurally similar to that of the I domain. However, it contains a specificity-determining loop, which was reported to contribute toward ligand binding specificity and integrin αβ subunit association (4Takagi J. DeBottis D.P. Erickson H.P. Springer T.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4339-4347Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and it has two additional divalent cation-binding sites. The MIDAS of the I-like domain is flanked by the adjacent to MIDAS (ADMIDAS) and the ligand-induced metal-binding site (LIMBS), which serve as negative and positive regulatory sites, respectively (5Chen J. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 6Chen J. Takagi J. Xie C. Xiao T. Luo B.H. Springer T.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 51622-51629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The conserved coordinating residues that are involved in the three cation-binding sites of the I-like domain are highlighted (Fig. 1A). The leukocyte-restricted β2 integrins contain four members that differ in their α subunits, the αLβ2, αMβ2, αXβ2, and αDβ2 (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6884) Google Scholar). These integrins maintain a functional immune system by their direct involvement in processes such as leukocyte adhesion and migration, phagocytosis, and antigen presentation. All four members contain the I domain that serves as the primary ligand-binding site. The structure of an I domain-containing integrin is lacking. Thus, the mechanism of I domain regulation by other domain(s) in an intact integrin is drawn largely from isolated I domain structures without or with ligands (8Lee J.O. Bankston L.A.

Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Notably, I domain ligand binding was shown to be regulated allosterically by the I-like domain. An invariant glutamate residing in the last helix of the I domain serves as an intrinsic ligand for the I-like domain (16Yang W. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2906-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Mutations in the I-like domain of the β2 integrins are known to generate receptors with impaired functions as exemplified in the inherited disorder leukocyte adhesion deficiency 1 (LAD-1) (17Hogg N. Bates P.A. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The I-like domain mutations S116P and D209H generate β2 integrins that were expressed on the cell surface but dysfunctional (18Hogg N. Stewart M.P. Scarth S.L. Newton R. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. Klein N. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Mathew E.C. Shaw J.M. Bonilla F.A. Law S.K. Wright D.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 121: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ser116 and Asp209 are coordinating residues of the MIDAS/ADMIDAS and LIMBS, respectively (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the I-like domain mutation N329S, which was not inherited from either parent, was identified in a patient having another mutation causing aberrant splicing of the integrin β2 subunit (20Nelson C. Rabb H. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3351-3357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although N329S mutation supported moderate integrin αMβ2 expression in a surrogate cell transfection system (20Nelson C. Rabb H. Arnaout M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3351-3357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains unclear as to the effect of this mutation on β2 integrin ligand binding function. Previously, we reported the expression of a constitutively active αLβ2N329S that adhered to intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (21Tng E. Tan S.M. Ranganathan S. Cheng M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54334-54339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that integrin αLβ2 may undergo conformational changes that generate the resting, intermediate, and high affinity states (22Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Nishida N. Xie C. Shimaoka M. Cheng Y. Walz T. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2006; 25: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Herein, we further characterize and report N329S as a mutation that promotes a high affinity αLβ2. Similarly, the same mutation introduced into the I-less integrin αIIbβ3 produced an active receptor. Combinatorial analyses of N329S with S116P or D209H showed that the activating effect of N329S requires functional I-like domain MIDAS and LIMBS to allow propagation of the activating signal to the αL I domain. Of note, this Asn at position 329 in integrin β2 primary sequence is conserved in all integrin β subunits. It may interact with neighboring residues to stabilize the β I-like domain β6-α7 loop that is required for the transmission of activation signal.

Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by sequencing (Research Biolabs, Singapore). Cell Transfections and Expression Analyses—Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and maintained in growth medium Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10%(v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. 293T cells were transfected with expression plasmids using the calcium phosphate method (34DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry Analyses—The preparation of samples for flow cytometry analyses was reported previously (35Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell surface expression of β3 and β2 integrins was analyzed using the mAb 7E3 and the heterodimer-specific mAb MHM23, respectively, followed by flow cytometry analysis on a FACSCalibur using the software CellQuest (BD Biosciences). The expression level was represented by the expression index (EI) that was calculated by the percentage of cells gated positive × geo-mean fluorescence intensity. An irrelevant mAb was used as background control in all preparations. Cell Adhesion Assays—Adhesion of αLβ2 transfectants to ICAMs was performed as reported (35Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, each Polysorb microtiter well (Nunc, Rosklide, Denmark) was coated with 0.5 μg of goat anti-human IgG (Fc specific) (Sigma) in 100 μl of 50 mm bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, 50 μl of ICAM-Fc at 1 ng/μl in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was added to each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were washed twice in RPMI wash buffer (RPMI medium containing 5% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) before assay. Cells labeled with 3.0 mm 2′,7′ bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were incubated in wash buffer containing Mg/EGTA (5 mm MgCl2 and 1.5 mm EGTA) and/or activating mAb KIM185 (10 μg/ml) to activate αLβ2. αLβ2-mediated adhesion specificity was demonstrated using MHM24 (10 μg/ml). Fluorescence signal, which correlates with the number of cells adhering to the ligand-coated well, is measured using a FL600 fluorescent plate reader (Bio-Tek instruments, Winooski, VT). For αIIbβ3 transfectant adhesion to fibrinogen, fibrinogen at 1 μg/ml in PBS was added into each microtiter well. The subsequent steps in the binding assay were the same as that of αLβ2 aforementioned. αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion specificity was assessed using the function-blocking mAb 10E5 (10 μg/ml). 1 mm MnCl2 was used to activate αIIbβ3. Surface Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—Surface labeling of integrins with biotin was described previously (35Tan S.M. Hyland R.H. Al-Shamkhani A. Douglass W.A. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2574-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once in PBS and incubated in sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) at 0.5 mg/ml in PBS for 20 min on ice. The reaction was terminated by washing surface-labeled cells once in PBS containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Thereafter, labeled cells were incubated in warm culture medium containing appropriate mAb MHM23, KIM127, or MEM148 (2 μg each) in the absence or presence of Mg/EGTA for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were spun down and lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) containing appropriate protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) followed by immunoprecipitation with rabbit anti-mouse IgG coupled to Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Bound proteins were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions. Proteins were transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and biotinylated protein bands were detected with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase followed by enhanced chemiluminescence detection using the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). Structural Images and Modeling—LSQKAB (Collaborative Computational Project, CCP4) (36Collaborative Computational Project Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19764) Google Scholar) was used for molecular least-squares superposition of the three I-like domain conformers. Figs. 1B and 7 were created using PyMOL. The solvent-accessible surface area of β3 Asn339 of the three conformers was calculated using AREAIMOL (Collaborative Computational Project Number 4) with a probe of 1.7 Å radius: 46.1 Å2 (conformer I); 16.5 Å2 (conformer II); 68.8 Å2 (conformer III). Structural models of wild-type β2 I-like domain or variants were generated using Modeler 9.1. Energy computations of wild-type β2 I-like domain model or variants having Asn329 substituted with Gln, Ala, Ser, Thr, or Asp were done with GROMOS96 implementation of Swiss-PdbViewer. The models generated were examined for potential hydrogen bond(s) formation between Gln329, Ala329, Ser329, Thr329, or Asp329 of the α7 helix with Ser324 and Glu322 of the β6 strand. In the wild-type β2 I-like domain, Asn329 δ1O and δ2NH2 hydrogen-bond with Ser324 and main chain carbonyl of Glu322, respectively. In variant N329Q, Gln329ϵ1O hydrogen-bonds with Ser324. The variants N329A, N329S, and N329T lack a hydrogen bond between Asn329 and Ser324 or Glu322. In variant N329D, Asp329 hydrogen-bonds with Ser324 but not with Glu322. N329S Generates a High Affinity αLβ2 That Adheres to ICAM-1 and ICAM-3 Substrates Constitutively—The possibility of at least three affinity states of αLβ2 based on functional and structural studies prompted us to examine the affinity state of αLβ2N329S (22Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 23Nishida N. Xie C. Shimaoka M. Cheng Y. Walz T. Springer T.A. Immunity. 2006; 25: 583-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We showed previously that an intermediate affinity αLβ2 adhered to ICAM-1 but that a high affinity conformer was required for adhesion to ICAM-3 (22Tang R.H. Tng E. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29208-29216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Herein, αLβ2N329S transfectant showed a high level of constitutive adhesion to ICAM-1 even in the absence of activating agent, whereas wild-type αLβ2 required activation with Mg/EGTA (Fig. 2). This is consistent with our first report on the constitutive activity of αLβ2 N329S with respect to ICAM-1 adhesion (21Tng E. Tan S.M. Ranganathan S. Cheng M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54334-54339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Importantly, unlike wild-type αLβ2 transfectant, αLβ2N329S transfectant also showed a high level of constitutive adhesion to ICAM-3 in the absence of activating agents Mg/EGTA and the integrin β2-specific activating mAb KIM185 (Fig. 2). The expressions (represented as EI) of wild-type αLβ2 and αLβ2N329S were comparable as assessed by flow cytometry using the β2 integrin heterodimer-specific mAb MHM23. The binding specificity was demonstrated using the αLβ2-specific function-blocking mAb MHM24. Thus, the mutation N329S generates a high affinity αLβ2 with respect to ICAMs adhesions. The Requirement of Cβ Instead of Cγ Amide Functional Group at Position 329 of the β2 I-like Domain—The Asn at position 329 of the β2 is conserved in all integrin β subunits. Because the native structure of the β2 I-like domain has not been resolved and because of the fact that the corresponding residue in the β3 is Asn339, we made use of the resolved structure of the β3 I-like domain of αVβ3 in complex with an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) ligand (37Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) to visualize the position of this conserved Asn and the three metal-binding sites. The β3 Asn339 lies before the last helix of the I-like domain (Fig. 1B). Further, the position of LIMBS (gold), MIDAS (pink), and ADMIDAS (blue) cations and the location of Asp217 (coordinating residue for LIMBS) and Ser123 (coordinating residue for MIDAS) are illustrated. In the liganded I domain, a significant downward displacement of its C-terminal helix was observed (8Lee J.O. Bankston L.A. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1333-1340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 38Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, open conformation αL and αM I domains, which have high affinity ligand binding properties, were generated by introducing cystine that stabilized the last helix of the I domains (12Shimaoka M. Lu C. Palframan R.T. von Andrian U.H. McCormack A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6009-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 13Shimaoka M. Lu C. Salas A. Xiao T. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16737-16741Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Similar to the I domain, the last helix of the β3 I-like domain was displaced in a ligand mimetic-bound αIIbβ3 (15Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). At present, it is unclear how β2N329S confers αLβ2 constitutive propensity to adhere to ICAM-1 (21Tng E. Tan S.M. Ranganathan S. Cheng M. Law S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54334-54339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The substitution of an amide to a hydroxyl side chain (Asn → Ser) hints at the possibility of functional group contribution toward the marked difference in the activity of αLβ2 with β2 Asn329 or Ser329. Therefore, four other variants, αLβ2N329T, αLβ2N329Q, αLβ2N329A, and αLβ2N329D, were generated and tested for their constitutive capacities to adhere to the ICAMs (Fig. 3). All four transfectants constitutively adhered to ICAM-1 even in the absence of Mg/EGTA (Fig. 3A). Similarly, these transfectants adhered constitutively to ICAM-3 (Fig. 3B). The expression levels of αLβ2N329T, αLβ2N329Q, αLβ2N329A, and αLβ2N329D were determined by flow cytometry. The adhesion specificity was assessed by using the αLβ2-specific function-blocking mAb MHM24. It is apparent that the introduction of a hydroxyl group as a result of N329S mutation does not have a primary role in generating a constitutively active αLβ2 because the substitutions N329Q, N329A, and N329D in β2 promoted comparable ICAM-adhesion activity. It is tempting to speculate that the altered binding property of αLβ2N329S is attributed mainly to the loss of the side chain amide group at position 329 of the β2. However, the β2 mutation N329Q, which had a similar activating effect on αLβ2, suggests the requirement of Cβ instead of Cγ amide group at position 329 of the β2 I-like domain to maintain the functional integrity of αLβ2. The LIMBS and MIDAS of the I-like Domain Are Required for the Activating Effect of N329S in I Domain-containing αLβ2—In I domain-containing integrins, the I-like domain allosterically regulates the ligand binding activity of the I domain (16Yang W. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2906-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to suggest that structural changes at the locality of β2 N329S are propagated to the ligand-binding face of the I-like domain. This may trigger I-like domain binding of the invariant Glu in the last C-terminal helix of the αL I domain, thus activating I domain ligand binding. Therefore, disrupting the ligand-binding sites of the I-like domain should abrogate the activating signal of N329S. Indeed, transfectants bearing αLβ2 having composite mutations N329S and S116P or D209H failed to adhere to ICAM-1 even in the presence of activating agents (Fig. 4). The adhesion specificity mediated by αLβ2 was demonstrated in all cases by complete abrogation of adhesion in the presence of mAb MHM24. The expression levels of these αLβ2 variants were comparable. Ser116 is the third coordinating residue found in the signature motif DXSXS of the I-like domain MIDAS, and the function disrupting effect of S116P, identified in LAD-1 patient, has been reported (18Hogg N. Stewart M.P. Scarth S.L. Newton R. Shaw J.M. Law S.K. Klein N. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Asp209 is a LIMBS-coordinating residue. Conceivably, the LAD-1 D209H mutation abolished β2 integrin ligand binding capacity (19Mathew E.C. Shaw J.M. Bonilla F.A. Law S.K. Wright D.A. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 121: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which corroborates well with the role of LIMBS in stabilizing MIDAS-mediated firm adhesion (5Chen J. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that the activating effect of N329S is propagated through the ligand-binding site(s) of the β2 I-like domain, which subsequently activates by allostery the αL I domain. Introduction of N339S in β3, Which Corresponds to N329S in β2, Generates a Constitutively Active I-less Integrin αIIbβ3—The Asn at position 329 of integrin β2 is conserved in all integrin β subunits (Fig. 1A). To further demonstrate that the activating signal of Asn mutation is propagated to the ligand-binding site(s) of the I-like domain, we extended the investigation to the I-less integrin αIIbβ3 because the β3 I-like domain participates directly in extrinsic ligand binding (15Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 37Xiong J.P. Stehle T. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Frech M. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The corresponding Asn339 in β3 (Fig. 1B) was substituted with Ser to generate αIIbβ3N339S. Ser116 and Asp209 of the integrin β2 are also conserved in all integrin β subunits. The corresponding residues in integrin β3 are Ser123 and Asp217. Thus, the MIDAS variant αIIbβ3S123P and the LIMBS variant αIIbβ3D217H were constructed. In addition, the composite variants αIIbβ3N339S/S123P and αIIbβ3N339S/D217H were generated (Fig. 5). Expression levels of αIIbβ3 and variants on transfectants were analyzed by flow cytometry using the β3-specific mAb 7E3. Wild-type αIIbβ3 transfectants adhered avidly to its ligand fibrinogen only in the presence of activating manganese. By contrast, αIIbβ3N339S showed constitutive adhesion to fibrinogen even in the absence of manganese. The specificity of αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion was demonstrated using αIIb-specific function-blocking mAb 10E5. Substitutions S123P and D217H in β3 abolished αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen. When S123P or D217H was introduced in combination with N339S, it attenuated the activating effect of N339S on αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen. Theref"

These elongated fatty acids are synthesized by a system of enzymes that are organized in a complex within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Although several of the components of the elongase complex have recently been identified, little is known about how these proteins are organized within the membrane or about how they interact with one another during fatty acid elongation. In this study the topology of Tsc13p, the enoyl reductase of the elongase system, was investigated. The N and C termini of Tsc13p reside in the cytoplasm, and six putative membrane-spanning domains were identified by insertion of glycosylation and factor Xa cleavage sites at various positions. The N-terminal domain including the first membrane-spanning segment contains sufficient information for targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Studies of the Arabidopsis Tsc13p protein revealed a similar topology. Highly conserved domains of the Tsc13p proteins that are likely to be important for enzymatic activity lie on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, possibly partially embedded within the membrane.

Cytosolic fatty acid synthases catalyze the de novo synthesis of the 16 or 18 carbons containing fatty acids that are further elongated to very long chain fatty acids by a microsomal enzyme system, the elongase. Very long chain fatty acids are essential components of cuticular waxes and seed triacylglycerols in plants and of several classes of lipids, including the sphingolipids. Sphingolipids function in eukaryotic cells as membrane structural components, in cell interactions with surroundings, and as bioactive molecules involved in signaling and cell regulation. Sphingolipids also interact with sterols to form lipid rafts, which are involved in trafficking of plasma membrane proteins, endocytosis, and protein stability at the cell surface (1Wang Q. Chang A.

A complete understanding of the molecular mechanism and organization of the elongase complex will require structural analysis, a challenging prospect because of the intrinsic technical difficulties associated with the purification and crystallization of membrane proteins. However, in the absence of high resolution structural data, detailed topology models aid in the design and interpretation of structure-function studies of membrane proteins. Thus, as a first step toward elucidating the organization of the elongase complex we have undertaken the topological mapping of the component proteins. Here we present our studies on the topological organization of the S. cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana Tsc13p proteins, the enoyl-CoA reductases of the elongase complex. TSC13 was identified in a screen for mutants that suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of csg2Δ cells (18Beeler T. Bacikova D. Gable K. Hopkins L. Johnson C. Slife H. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30688-30694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Csg2p is required for conversion of inositolphosphoceramide (IPC) to mannosylinositolphosphoceramide, and we discovered several years ago that the over-accumulation of IPC in the csg2Δ cells results in calcium sensitivity (18Beeler T.

In the present study we provide evidence that the N and C termini of both the yeast and Arabidopsis Tsc13p proteins reside in the cytosol and that these proteins contain six membrane-spanning domains. Based on this model, two highly conserved and functionally critical residues are found to be associated with the membrane, raising the possibility that the active site of the enzyme is partially embedded within the lipid bilayer. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast media were prepared, and cells were grown according to standard procedures (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1986Google Scholar). The yeast Matα ura3-52 ade his4 trp1Δ leu2Δ tsc13::TRP/pTSC13-316 strain was used in this study. Disruption of TSC13 Gene and Construction of Tagged Yeast and Arabidopsis TSC13—Construction of the tsc13Δ mutant and the pTSC13-316 and pMYC-TSC13-426 plasmids were described previously (7Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The plasmid expressing the dual epitope-tagged Myc-Tsc13p-HA was generated by moving the 3×-MYC-TSC13 cassette from pMYC-TSC13-426 to pRS425, introducing an in-frame SpeI site between codon 309 and the stop codon of the TSC13 gene by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) and ligating a SpeI-ended 3×-HA cassette into the SpeI site. To generate the 1-117-GFP fusion protein, the MYC-TSC13-425 plasmid containing the SpeI at position 309 was digested with SpeI and NheI to remove the fragment encoding amino acids 117-309 of Tsc13p. The remaining vector fragment was ligated with an XbaI-ended fragment encoding GFP (5Han G. Gable K. Kohlwein S.D. Beaudoin F. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35440-35449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. A yeast plasmid constitutively expressing the 3×-HA-N-terminal-tagged Arabidopsis gene, At3g55360 (designated hereafter as AtTSC13) under control of the ADH promoter, was generated as described previously (15Gable K. Garton S. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. J. Exp. Bot. 2004; 55: 543-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). TSC13-GC Topology Reporter Plasmids—The TSC13 gene fusion alleles with the invertase glycosylation cassette (Suc2A or GC) inserted were constructed in two steps. In the first step, in-frame SpeI restriction sites (encoding threonine and serine) were introduced at 12 positions (indicated in Fig. 1) within the TSC13 gene. For each mutagenesis reaction, the MYC-TSC13-425 plasmid was used as template, and a pair of mutagenic primers containing the SpeI site flanked by 12 nucleotides of homology to TSC13 was used. After mutagenesis and transformation into Escherichia coli, plasmids were isolated and screened for the presence of the SpeI site. In the second step the SpeI-ended GC (the 53-amino acid domain from the Suc2p protein that has 3 sites for N-linked glycosylation) was inserted into the SpeI sites as well as into an in-frame NheI site at position 117. The DNA sequences of all the constructs were verified by sequencing. The GC cassette was inserted at seven different locations along the AtTSC13 gene (Fig. 1) using the same strategy. Construction of TSC13-fXa Fusion Alleles—fXa cleavage sites were inserted using a pair of oligonucleotides encoding a repeat of the fXa protease recognition site (IEGR) that would anneal to leave overhanging ends compatible for ligation into the SpeI sites of pMYC-TSC13-425 (described above). The oligonucleotides were annealed by mixing, heating at 95 °C for 5 min, and cooling on ice. The TSC13-fXa fusion alleles were verified by DNA sequencing. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The tsc13 mutant alleles with charged residues substituted by alanine were generated by QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene). All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Complementation Assay—The various Tsc13p-GC, Tsc13p-fXa, alanine substitution mutant, and epitope-tagged Tsc13p proteins were assessed for function by determining whether their expression would complement the lethality of the tsc13Δ mutant. Plasmids expressing the modified tsc13 alleles were introduced into pTSC13-316-rescued tsc13Δ mutant cells, and the transformants were tested for their ability to lose the URA3+-marked pTSC13-316 rescuing plasmid. Transformants containing plasmids expressing functional Tsc13p proteins were able to lose the URA3+-marked plasmid and were, therefore, able to grow on 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA)-containing plates. Determination of the Glycosylation Status of the Tsc13p-GC Fusion Proteins—For analysis of the glycosylation status of the Tsc13p-GC proteins, microsomes were prepared from cells grown in minimal medium (minus leucine) to ensure maintenance of the plasmid. The cells were pelleted, washed with water, resuspended at 2 ml/g wet weight, and lysed by bead beating in 50 mm Tris, 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μm leupeptin. Glass beads were added to the meniscus, and cells were lysed by four cycles (60 s each) of vortexing with cooling on ice between cycles. Unbroken cells, beads, and debris were removed by centrifugation (5000 × g for 10 min), and the low speed supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to provide the microsomal pellet. The pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, repelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and resuspended at ∼10 mg/ml protein in the same buffer containing 33% glycerol. The glycosylation status of the Tsc13p-GC proteins was analyzed as described previously (21Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Han G. Gable K. Yan L. Natarajan M. Krishnamurthy J. Gupta S.D. Borovitskaya A. Harmon J.M. Dunn T.M.

In brief, 100 μg of microsomal protein was suspended in 54 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Na2EDTA, 50 mm NaCl. Six μl of 10× denaturing buffer (5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol) were added, and the samples were incubated at 70 °C for 10 min. Ten μl of 0.5 m sodium citrate, pH 5.5, were added to the heated samples to bring the volume to 70 μl, and the samples were split into two aliquots. One aliquot was treated with 5000 units of endoglycosidase H (Endo H; New England Biolabs), and the other aliquot was incubated with buffer at 37 °C for 60 min and then further incubated at 70 °C for 10 min with denaturing buffer (5% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol). After resolution by 12% SDS-PAGE, the proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Right-side-out Microsomal Vesicle Preparation and Cleavage with Factor Xa Protease—Preparation of microsomes for analyzing the fusion proteins containing the fXa cleavage sites was performed essentially as described previously (21Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Han G. Gable K. Yan L. Natarajan M. Krishnamurthy J. Gupta S.D.

Spheroplasts were generated and lysed with lysis buffer, and the homogenates were cleared of debris. The microsomal membrane fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, washed once with storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sorbitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and resuspended in storage buffer at 4 mg/ml protein. The fXa protease cleavage assay was performed as described (22Han G. Gable K. Yan L. Natarajan M. Krishnamurthy J. Gupta S.D. Borovitskaya A. Harmon J.M. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53707-53716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the products were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting. Protease Protection Assay—Right-side-out microsomes were prepared from yeast expressing the HA-TSC13-MYC fusion protein. Protease protection assays were performed as described (23Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting. Cell Fractionation—Microsomes were prepared by bead beating (17Paul S. Gable K. Beaudoin F. Cahoon E. Jaworski J. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9018-9029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and incubated on ice for 1 h with an equal volume of buffer containing either 1 m sodium chloride, 0.4 m sodium carbonate, or 2% Triton X-100. After centrifugation of the samples at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant and the pellet fractions were collected and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blots were blocked in 0.1 m Tris, 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% dry milk. Myc-Tsc13p was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-Myc antibodies (Sigma) at 1/2500, the HA-tagged proteins were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (Roche Applied Science) at 1/1000, and Kar2p was detected using anti-Kar2p (1:10,000) as the primary antibody followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad). The bound antibodies were detected using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence and Fluorescence Microscopy—Immunostaining of Myc-Tsc13p and fluorescence microscopy of the 1-117-GFP fusion protein were performed as described (5Han G. Gable K. Kohlwein S.D. Beaudoin F. Napier J.A. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35440-35449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For detecting Myc-Tsc13p, cells were incubated with a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (from Invitrogen; 1:200 dilution) followed by the Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Sigma; 1:5000). Membrane Topology Predictions for Tsc13p—Tsc13p, the enoyl reductase of the fatty acid elongation system, is an integral ER membrane protein. Determination of the topology of Tsc13p is an important step toward understanding both its mechanism and its organization within the elongase complex. As is often the case, various algorithms for predicting membrane-spanning segments suggested several possible topologies for Tsc13p. SOSUI, a program that takes into account the Kyte Doolittle hydropathy, amphiphilicity, amino acid charge, and the length of the protein (24Hirokawa T. Boon-Chieng S. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar), predicted a single transmembrane domain (TMD) located between amino acids 262-283. In contrast, six TMDs were predicted by both Localizome (86-105, 125-143, 164-184, 204-226, 247-266, and 272-291) and HMMTOP (88-112, 145-162, 169-186, 203-220, 251-269, and 274-291). Localizome uses hmmpfam to detect the presence of Pfam domains (25Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar) and a prediction algorithm, Phobius, to predict the TM helices. The results are combined and checked against the TM topology rules stored in a protein domain data base called LocaloDom (26Lee S. Lee B. Jang I. Kim S. Bhak J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 99-103Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). HMMTOP (Hidden Markov Model for Topology Prediction) is based on the principle that topology of TM proteins is determined by the difference in amino acid distribution in various structural parts of these proteins rather than by specific amino acid composition (27Tusnady G.E. Simon I. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 28Tusnady G.E. Simon I. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 849-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). TMHMM, which is also based on a hidden Markov Model (29Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8983) Google Scholar), predicts four TMDs (166-188, 202-222, 243-265 and 269-291). In the experiments described below, these different models for Tsc13p topology were experimentally evaluated. Mapping the Orientation of the Tsc13p Termini by Protease Protection—To determine the orientation of the N- and C-terminal ends of Tsc13p, the N terminus was tagged by inserting a Myc epitope after the start codon, and the C terminus was tagged by inserting an HA epitope before the stop codon. To ascertain that insertion of the epitope tags did not alter the structure of Tsc13p, the function of the epitope-tagged protein was tested. TCS13 is an essential gene in S. cerevisiae (7Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and thus, the plasmid carrying the wild-type TCS13 gene is required for survival of the haploid deletion strain. A LEU2-marked plasmid expressing Myc-Tsc13p-HA was transformed into the rescued tsc13Δ. FOA-resistant colonies that had lost the URA3- marked TSC13 plasmid were recovered, indicating that insertion of the N- and C-terminal epitope tags did not disrupt the function of Tsc13p (Fig. 2A). In addition, immunofluorescence localization of the Myc-Tsc13p-HA protein revealed perinuclear and peripheral ER staining (Fig. 2B) similar to that previously observed for wild-type Tsc13p (7Kohlwein S.D. Eder S. Oh C.S. Martin C.E. Gable K. Bacikova D. Dunn T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 109-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To localize the N and C termini of Tsc13p with respect to the ER membrane, protease protection assays were conducted. Sealed right-side-out membrane vesicles were isolated by gently lysing yeast spheroplasts prepared from cells expressing Myc-Tsc13p-HA, and sensitivity of the protein to proteinase K in the presence or absence of detergent was examined. The vesicles were treated with proteinase K in the presence or absence of detergent, and the Myc-Tsc13p-HA was analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-Myc or anti-HA antibodies. The immunoblots indicated that both the N-terminal Myc tag and the C-terminal HA tag were sensitive to proteinase K even in the absence of detergent as no protected immunoreactive protein fragments were detected in either case (Fig. 3). If the N terminus had been lumenal, a protected Myc fragment should have been observed, and similarly, if the C terminus were in the ER lumen, a protected HA-tagged fragment would have been seen. This indicates that both the N and C termini of Tsc13p are cytosolically oriented and that Tsc13p has an even number of membrane spanning domains. The integrity of the sealed right-side-out vesicles was confirmed by the observation that the ER lumenal Kar2p protein was insensitive to proteinase K until the vesicles were disrupted with detergent (Fig. 3). As has been previously reported, in the presence of detergent proteinase K clipped Kar2p to a smaller size but did not completely degrade it (23Romano J.D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1957-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The sidedness of the vesicles prepared using this procedure was previously confirmed by demonstrating that fXa protease cleavage sites inserted into the lumenal domains of the integral membrane protein, Lcb1p, were inaccessible to the fXa protease unless the vesicles were disrupted with detergent (22Han G. Gable K. Yan L. Natarajan M. Krishnamurthy J. Gupta S.D. Borovitskaya A. Harmon J.M. Dunn T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53707-53716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Native Glycosylation Sites at Residues 38 and 255 of Tsc13p Are Not Modified—A well established approach to map the topology of ER membrane proteins takes advantage of the lumen specific glycosylation machinery. The glycosylation status of the two potential N-linked glycosylation sites (NX(S/T)) at residues 38 and 255 of Tsc13p was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 4A, treatment with Endo H did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of Myc-Tsc13p, demonstrating that the potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the native Tsc13p sequence are not glycosylated. The first predicted TMD lies between residues 86 and 110; therefore, the lack of modification of the potential glycosylation site at 38 is consistent with the protease sensitivity results and provides further evidence that the N terminus of Tsc13p is cytosolic. The lack of glycosylation at 255 indicates that this residue is also not in a lumenal loop that is accessible to the glycosylation machinery. Several of the hydropathy algorithms (discussed above) place residue 255 within a TMD, which would explain the lack of modification of this potential glycosylation site. Analysis of Tsc13p-GC Fusion Proteins Reveals Several Membrane-associated Domains—To further investigate the topology of Tsc13p, a set of fusion proteins containing a glycosylation reporter cassette (GC) inserted in-frame at 13 positions along the length of the protein was constructed (Fig. 4A). The cassette consists of a 53-amino acid domain comprising residues 80-133 of invertase (Suc2p) that contains three NX(S/T) sites for N-linked glycosylation. These sites are located far enough from the N- and C-terminal ends of the cassette to ensure that if the GC is inserted anywhere in the lumenal loop of a fusion protein, the acceptor sites will be sufficiently far from the membrane to be recognized by the glycosylation machinery (21Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The locations within Tsc13p into which the cassettes were inserted were chosen based on their ability to distinguish the different topological models predicted by the hydropathy analyses. In addition, alignments of Tsc13p proteins from different species were used in an attempt to identify sites with low conservation across evolution that might be sufficiently flexible to tolerate an insertion without disrupting function (Fig. 1). This reporter cassette has been successfully used in determining the topology of other membrane proteins (21Gilstring C.F. Ljungdahl P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31488-31495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Han G. Gable K. Yan L. Natarajan M. Krishnamurthy J. Gupta S.D. Borovitskaya A. Harmon J.M. Dunn T.M.

A. 2006; 103: 11142-11147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and its insertion into lumenal loops between membrane-spanning domains has not been observed to interfere with their insertion or orientation. The Tsc13p-GC fusion proteins were evaluated for function by testing their ability to restore viability to the tsc13Δ mutant. Tsc13p-GC fusions with the Suc2p domain inserted at eight different locations were functional (Fig. 4A), indicating that these proteins retained their native conformation. Tsc13p-GC fusions with the cassette inserted at position 135 or 166 resulted in unstable proteins. Although insertion of the cassette at position 159 or 170 resulted in stable proteins, these fusion proteins were not functional (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence revealed that these two fusion proteins failed to localize to the ER (data not shown). The Tsc13p-GC fusion protein with the cassette at position 273 was also not functional (Fig. 4A), but this protein displayed normal ER localization (data not shown). The Tsc13p-GC fusion proteins with the cassette inserted at 117, 126, 198, or 273 were glycosylated as indicated by increased electrophoretic mobility after Endo H treatment, and therefore, these region"
