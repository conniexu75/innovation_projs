In particular, seasonal trends in blood pressure do not seem to have been measured hitherto."

https://openalex.org/W1990334687,"Grubb and Laurell1, Harboe and Lundevall2 and Harboe3 have described the serum groups Gma, Gmx and Gmb with the help of some rheumatoid-arthritic sera which were able to agglutinate O Rh + red cells sensitized with an incomplete anti-D. Also with an anti-D rheumatoid-arthritic serum complex, Steinberg and Giles4 have discovered a new factor (Gm-like) only present in the Negro sera but absent in the Whites. Roparbz et al. 5 have demonstrated that some sera withdrawn from healthy donors could be used for the Gm groups typings; in fact, such sera sometimes possess a very pure anti-Gm specificity."

https://openalex.org/W187437815,"Much of the experimental work upon the state of glycogen in animal tissues has been interpreted as showing that glycogen exists in tissues in two forms. Early workers (l-4) found that extraction of animal tissues with water or cold trichloroacetic acid solution yielded less glycogen than was obtained by boiling the tissue in an alkaline solution. Various names were used to designate the two fractions. “Easily extractable,” “free,” “lyo-,” and “trichloroacetic acid-extractable” are terms that have been used for the glycogen fraction extracted with water or cold trichloroacetic acid solution; and ‘difficultly extractable,” “fixed,” “bound,” “desmo-,” and “residual” are designations that have been used for the form that required alkaline digestion to extract it from the tissues. Many workers assumed that the difficultly extractable glycogen was bound to protein, but Pfliiger (5) and Meyer (6) found no basis for the assumption of such a binding. Bloom et al. (7) found that in resting, normal, fed rats, the glycogen of the liver extractable with trichloroacetic acid solution comprises 85% of the total glycogen obtained by boiling with 30% KOH solution. The same extraction of the livers of these animals, after they had been fasted for 24 hours, yielded only 7.9% of that obtained by alkaline digestion. These authors found that in the muscle of normal rats the trichloroacetic acidextractable glycogen was 55 y0 of that obtained by alkaline digestion; and 4 hours after subcutaneous epinephrine injection this fraction was 16.4% of the amount obtained by alkaline digestion. Other workers have observed a shifting in the distribution of glycogen between the two fractions as a result of fasting (4, 8lo), epinephrine injection (8, ll-14), insulin administration (12, 14, 15)) thyroxin injection (16)) adrenalectomy (9), hypophysectomy (9), and muscle work (17). In our laboratory it was found that extraction of heart muscle by thorough grinding with 5% trichloroacetic acid solution (Servall Omnimixer once, and the Potter-Elvehjem apparatus three times) yielded an average of 57% of the total glycogen (18). Alkaline digestion of the residue after the four homogenizations with trichloroacetic acid solution, followed by alcoholic precipitation, yielded an additional 43 ‘% of glycogen. The latter was shown to be an essentially pure product by analysis with anthrone reagent and, after hydrolysis, by copper reduction and glucose oxidase techniques (18)."

It has disclosed such unsuspected phenomena as the dual routes of entry into the brain of acetazolamide. Although many factors controlling drug entry remain to be studied, we propose certain general conclusions."

https://openalex.org/W1986660659,"In 12 inbred strains of mice there was no general correlation between litter size and parental life span within strains, although a significant between-strain correlation of +0.69 was found between mean life span of the dams and the mean size of their litters. When data for AKR/J mice, which characteristically die early from leukemia, were excluded, the correlation was increased to +0.90 for the remaining 11 strains. These findings indicate that the correlation is of genetic origin—that is, that genes affecting a dam's life span also affect the size of her litters."

https://openalex.org/W2010449256,"Under standard conditions of temperature, humidity, and (artificial) diet, loss in flight ability is paralleled by a decline of up to 66⅔ percent in activity of enzymes dephosphorylating organophosphorous compounds in the thoracic flight muscle. Concomitantly, the content of adenosine triphosphate in the flight muscle increases five times, while the content of adenosine monophosphate correspondingly diminishes."
https://openalex.org/W53446405,"Escherichiu coli, when grown on a minimal medium, produces all of its cellular constituents from glucose, water, phosphate, and other inorganic compounds. The use of the isotopes of C, H, and N have revealed many of the chemical pathways used in the biosynthesis and degradation of the constituents of this cell. Taking advantage of the availability of high concentrations of Hz018 which have resulted from the work of Dostrovsky (l), we have investigated the contributions of H2018, H,POJ*, glucose1-018, and glucose-6018 to the oxygen atoms of the proteins of E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2002466602,"THE most characteristic biochemical change associated with the disorder of cattle known variously as grass staggers, lactation or nutrition tetany and Hereford disease is a fall in the blood-serum magnesium concentration from a normal value within the range 2.0–3.5 mgm./100 ml. to one of 0.7 mgm. or less. The disorder has its highest incidence in milking cows in spring, shortly after a change from winter rations to the grazing of pasture, and under such conditions frequently the fall in serum magnesium concentration is rapid; in extreme cases serum magnesium values of less than 0.7 mgm./100 ml. are observed within two days of the change of diet."
https://openalex.org/W2093395677,Catecholamine depletion by reserpine diminishes the tendency of the ventricle to escape from vagal suppression. Neither spinal section nor adrenalectomy enhances the reserpine effect. Norepinephrine restores the characteristic occurrence of ventricle escape during vagal stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2052179404,Arginine-repressed cells of Escherichia coli W do not form a protein immunologically related to ornithine transcarbamylase. This was determined by lack of cross-reactivity of repressed cell extracts with rabbit antisera prepared against purified ornithine transcarbamylase. The results indicate that arginine acts by blocking the synthesis of the entire enzyme-protein.
https://openalex.org/W2064171612,"Transmembrane potential and active tension were measured in isolated segments of turtle aorta and inferior vena cava. Changes in tension were associated with action potentials, but the potentials had a different pattern in the two tissues. When the frequency of the action potentials increased, the contractions summated, resulting in a steadily maintained contraction."

https://openalex.org/W2023686674,"EPIZOOTICS caused by polyoma virus have been reported1,2 in mouse colonies maintained in proximity to mice infected experimentally with this virus. Establishments without facilities to house infected and uninfected mice in separate buildings run the risk of contaminating their polyoma-free stock. It was of interest to determine, therefore, whether similar problems would be encountered when the Syrian hamster was used as the experimental animal to study this disease. Our experience indicates that infected hamsters rarely transmit polyoma virus to other hamsters or mice. The evidence that polyoma infection is a much less contagious disease of hamsters than of mice is shown by the following experiments."

It consists of X-raying the incubated egg to determine the skeletal morphology of the embryo. With the egg held in a horizontal position the embryo's longitudinal position can be easily detected. On rotating the egg through a 90° angle, exposing it a second time, and then viewing the X-ray plates in the order of taking, the direction in which the head is turned can be accurately determined."
