https://openalex.org/W2106104005,"Materials with nanoscopic dimensions not only have potential technological applications in areas such as device technology and drug delivery but also are of fundamental interest in that the properties of a material can change in this regime of transition between the bulk and molecular scales. In this article, a relatively new method for preparing nanomaterials, membrane-based synthesis, is reviewed. This method entails synthesis of the desired material within the pores of a nanoporous membrane. Because the membranes used contain cylindrical pores of uniform diameter, monodisperse nanocylinders of the desired material, whose dimensions can be carefully controlled, are obtained. This ""template"" method has been used to prepare polymers, metals, semiconductors, and other materials on a nanoscopic scale."

https://openalex.org/W2063335293,"The tribological properties of C(60) on the mesoscopic scale were investigated with a scanning force microscope, which allowed simultaneous measurements of normal and lateral forces under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions. Islands of C(60), deposited on NaCl(001), could be moved by the action of the probing tip in a controlled way. Different modes of motion, such as translation and rotation, were observed. An extremely small dissipation energy of about 0.25 millielectron volt per molecule and a cohesive energy of 1.5 electron volts were determined in these nanometer-scale experiments. The corresponding shear strength of 0.05 to 0.1 megapascal was smaller by one order of magnitude than typical values of boundary lubricants. For C(60) on graphite, disruption of the islands was observed and collective motion of the islands could not be achieved. These results could find use in the field of nanotechnology; for example, C(60) islands could be developed into a sled-type transport system on the nanometer scale."

These planktonic crustaceans appear to be the primary source of the pristane in liver oils of sharks and whales."
https://openalex.org/W2060672055,"The reduction in vigor of aneuploids was classically thought to be due to the imbalance of gene products expressed from the varied chromosome relative to those from the remainder of the genome. In this study, the dosage of chromosomal segments was varied, but the transcript level of most genes encoded therein showed compensation for the number of copies of the gene. Genes whose dosage was not altered were affected by aneuploidy of unlinked chromosomal segments. The phenotypic effects of aneuploidy and of a substantial fraction of quantitative variation are hypothesized to be the consequence of an altered dosage-sensitive regulatory system."

These consisted of a stem, 30 to 35 A wide and 45 to 50 A long, and a round head 75 to 80 A in diameter. The outer membranes of rat liver mitochondria showed regular arrays of hollow cylindrical subunits 60 A by 60 A."
https://openalex.org/W2066221008,"A uniform oxygen isotope value of -25 per mil was obtained from old ground water at depths of 20 to 30 meters in a thick deposit of clay in the southern part of the glacial Lake Agassiz basin. The lake occupied parts of North Dakota and southern Manitoba at the end of the last glacial maximum and received water from the ice margin and the interior plains region of Canada. Ground water from thick late Pleistocene-age clay deposits elsewhere, a till in southern Saskatchewan, and a glaciolacustrine deposit in northern Ontario show the same value at similar depths. These sites are at about 50 degrees N latitude, span a distance of 2000 kilometers, and like the Lake Agassiz sites, have a ground-water velocity of less than a few millimeters per year. The value of -25 per mil is characteristic of meltwater impounded in the southern basin of Lake Agassiz. This value corresponds to an estimated air temperature of -16 degrees C, compared with the modern temperature of 0 degrees C for this area."

https://openalex.org/W2023584231,"Very marked differences in the metastable persistence of coesite and stishovite have been demonstrated; the former possibly persists indefinitely below 1000째C at 1 atmosphere ""dry,"" and the latter completely decomposes in minutes above 500째 to 600째C to an amorphous or short range order phase. Quartz was grown (metastably) at temperatures well above its stability field from both coesite and stishovite, possibly by way of a short range order phase. The absence of stishovite in meteor-impact craters cannot be taken as evidence that it was not formed. If it has ""reversed"" in normal natural environments the product would almost certainly be a short range order phase or derivative."
https://openalex.org/W2052088575,A period in darkness or in continuous far-red light can cause the ferns of the species Marsilea vestita Hook. and Grev. to develop as a land form in a medium which normally allows only the water form to develop. Far-red light is more effective than darkness in causing this conversion. The difference in the quality of light reaching plants growing in water or on land may cause this conversion to occur in nature.
https://openalex.org/W2006905234,"After feeding through an artificial membrane on an 18 percent sucrose solution containing either acetate-1-C(14) or uniformly-labeled glucose-C(14), Myzus persicae incorporated 75 percent of the carbon-14 into palmitoleic, stearic, and oleic acids. Small amounts were incorporated into myristic, linoleic, and linolenic acids; no significant amounts were incorporated into the short-chain fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W2062749845,"Growth forms controlled by the photoperiod are modified by temperature and gibberellic acid. Gibberellic acid changes leaf orientation and prostrate growth habit of the short-day plant to that typical of the long-day plant and modifies leaf shape in both types of plants. Low temperature resembles short days in its effect on leaf shape and stem orientation of long-day plants. Geotropic responses of the stem appear to be modified by photoperiod, temperature, and gibberellic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2038613726,"Bollworms, Heliothis zea (Boddie), and salt-marsh caterpillars, Estigmene acrea (Drury) gradually decreased in ascorbic acid content as they matured, even in its presence. Cotton leafworms, Alabama argillacea (H체bner), also lost ascorbic acid, although a dietary need for the vitamin was not proved. Pink bollworms, Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders), reared without the vitamin, increased in ascorbic acid content as they matured, an indication that the vitamin was synthesized by the insect."
https://openalex.org/W2038730504,"Detailed study of post-Miocene stratigraphy in southeastern Virginia reveals at least 13 formations which show six Pliocene (?) and Pleistocene cycles of emergence and submergence, with maximum submergent sea levels near +45, +45, +20, +25, +15, and 0 feet, respectively. The newly established stratigraphic framework disproves earlier interpretations of ""terrace-stratigraphy"" and sea level chronologies."

Since the oceans remote location makes it particularly sensitive to indications of global climate change, a baseline of data is critical. Among the areas researched and discussed in this article are the following: the warm water layers in the intermediate space of the Arctic ocean; the albedo of the ocean; cloud cover; air pollution; plants and animals; cores of ocean bottom sediments. 2 figs."

NWS will not be predicting individual storms in these long-range forecasts, but rather large regions of above, below, or near normal temperature and precipitation. NWS meterologists are adopting three standard techniques for long-range forecasting, two based on objective methods for forecasting El Nino, and one, canonical correlation analysis, an effort to systematize what forecasters already do, looking for its of impending El Nino and other signs of imminent climatic change. 2 figs."

https://openalex.org/W2269382398,"The Catastrophes, phase shifts,and large-scale degradation of a Caribbean coral reef by Terence P. Hughes (9 Sept., p.1547) relates the sad story of the decline of scleractinian coral populations in Jamaica over the past two decades. The article is a rare example of the long-term research needed to document trends on reefs; however, the monitoring program design appears to have excluded at least one potentially important causal factor, and the solution offered does not address sociopolitical reality.

The data in the study by Hughes show a rapid decline of coral populations initiated by a 1980 hurricane. Coral cover declined further after the reduction of an herbivorous sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, resulting from disease, while the cover of fleshy macro-algae bloomed. Thus two natural events, hurricanes and disease, have decimated Jamaica's coral reefs. It is not clear what effect human activities have had on fleshy algae on these reefs and what, if anything, we can do to help the coral."
