https://openalex.org/W2992361169,"Due to the overlapping emission spectra of fluorophores, fluorescence microscopy images often have bleed-through problems, leading to a false positive detection. This problem is almost unavoidable when the samples are labeled with three or more fluorophores, and the situation is complicated even further when imaged under a multiphoton microscope. Several methods have been developed and commonly used by biologists for fluorescence microscopy spectral unmixing, such as linear unmixing, non-negative matrix factorization, deconvolution, and principal component analysis. However, they either require pre-knowledge of emission spectra or restrict the number of fluorophores to be the same as detection channels, which highly limits the real-world applications of those spectral unmixing methods. In this paper, we developed a robust and flexible spectral unmixing method: Learning Unsupervised Means of Spectra (LUMoS), which uses an unsupervised machine learning clustering method to learn individual fluorophores’ spectral signatures from mixed images, and blindly separate channels without restrictions on the number of fluorophores that can be imaged. This method highly expands the hardware capability of two-photon microscopy to simultaneously image more fluorophores than is possible with instrumentation alone. Experimental and simulated results demonstrated the robustness of LUMoS in multi-channel separations of two-photon microscopy images. We also extended the application of this method to background/autofluorescence removal and colocalization analysis. Lastly, we integrated this tool into ImageJ to offer an easy to use spectral unmixing tool for fluorescence imaging. LUMoS allows us to gain a higher spectral resolution and obtain a cleaner image without the need to upgrade the imaging hardware capabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2992036077,"Coralline algae (Corallinophycideae) are calcifying red algae that are foundation species in euphotic marine habitats globally. In recent years, corallines have received increasing attention due to their vulnerability to global climate change, in particular ocean acidification and warming, and because of the range of ecological functions that coralline algae provide, including provisioning habitat, influencing settlement of invertebrate and other algal species, and stabilising reef structures. Many of the ecological roles corallines perform, as well as their responses to stressors, have been demonstrated to be species-specific. In order to understand the roles and responses of coralline algae, it is essential to be able to reliably distinguish individual species, which are frequently morphologically cryptic. The aim of this study was to document the diversity and distribution of coralline algae in the New Zealand region using DNA based phylogenetic methods, and examine this diversity in a broader global context, discussing the implications and direction for future coralline algal research. Using three independent species delimitation methods, a total of 122 species of coralline algae were identified across the New Zealand region with high diversity found both regionally and also when sampling at small local spatial scales. While high diversity identified using molecular methods mirrors recent global discoveries, what distinguishes the results reported here is the large number of taxa (115) that do not resolve with type material from any genus and/or species. The ability to consistently and accurately distinguish species, and the application of authoritative names, are essential to ensure reproducible science in all areas of research into ecologically important yet vulnerable coralline algae taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2994571649,"The paper considers local responses to the introduction of an Ebola Treatment Centre in eastern Sierra Leone during the West African epidemic of 2014-15. Our study used qualitative methods consisting of focus groups and interviews, to gather responses from patients, members of the families of survivors and deceased victims of the disease, social liaison workers from the centre, and members of the general public. The data indicate that scepticism and resistance were widespread at the outset, but that misconceptions were replaced, in the minds of those directly affected by the disease, by more positive later assessments. Social workers, and social contacts of families with workers in the centre, helped reshape these perceptions, but a major factor was direct experience of the disease. This is apparent in the positive endorsements by survivors and families who had members taken to the facility. Even relatives of deceased victims agreed that the case-handling centre was valuable. However, we also present evidence of continuing scepticism in the minds of members of the general public, who continue to suspect that Ebola was a crisis manufactured for external benefit. Our conclusions stress the importance of better connectivity between communities and Ebola facilities to facilitate experiential learning. There is also a need to address the wider cognitive shock caused by a well-funded Ebola health initiative arriving in communities with a long history of inadequate health care. Restoring trust in medicine requires Ebola Virus Disease to be re-contextualized within a broader framework of concern for the health of all citizens."
https://openalex.org/W2993564483,"Background Since pancreatic steatosis is reported as a possible risk factor for pancreatic cancer, the development of a non-invasive method to quantify pancreatic steatosis is needed. Proton density fat fraction (PDFF) measurement is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based method for quantitatively assessing the steatosis of a region of interest (ROI). Although it is commonly used for quantification of hepatic steatosis, pancreatic PDFF can greatly vary depending on the ROI’s location because of the patchy nature of pancreatic fat accumulation. In this study, we attempted to quantify pancreatic steatosis by fat-water MRI with improved reproducibility. Methods Using the MRI images of 159 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, we attempted to calculate the average PDFF of whole pancreas. We set ROIs covering the entire area of the pancreas appearing in every slice and calculated the average PDFF from all the voxels included in the pancreas. We named this average value as whole-pancreatic PDFF and evaluated the reproducibility of the measured values. In addition to whole-pancreatic PDFF, we measured the average PDFF of the pancreatic head (head-PDFF) and that of the pancreatic body plus tail separately and analyzed their correlation with the clinical characteristics of the patients. Results The mean inter-examiner coefficient of variation of the whole-pancreatic PDFF was 11.39%. The whole-pancreatic PDFF was correlated with age (p = 0.039), body mass index (p = 0.0093) and presence/absence of diabetes (p = 0.0055). The serum level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was inversely correlated with the head-PDFF. Conclusion We developed a new measurement method of the pancreatic PDFF with greater reproducibility. Using this method, we characterized pancreatic steatosis in detail. This novel measurement method allows accurate estimation of the severity of pancreatic steatosis and is therefore useful for the detailed characterization of pancreatic steatosis."
https://openalex.org/W2992914408,"Chronic wasting disease is a prion disease affecting both free-ranging and farmed cervids in North America and Scandinavia. A range of cervid species have been found to be susceptible, each with variations in the gene for the normal prion protein, PRNP, reportedly influencing both disease susceptibility and progression in the respective hosts. Despite the finding of several different PRNP alleles in white-tailed deer, the majority of past research has focused on two of the more common alleles identified-the 96G and 96S alleles. In the present study, we evaluate both infection status and disease stage in nearly 2100 farmed deer depopulated in the United States and Canada, including 714 CWD-positive deer and correlate our findings with PRNP genotype, including the more rare 95H, 116G, and 226K alleles. We found significant differences in either likelihood of being found infected or disease stage (and in many cases both) at the time of depopulation in all genotypes present, relative to the most common 96GG genotype. Despite high prevalence in many of the herds examined, infection was not found in several of the reported genotypes. These findings suggest that additional research is necessary to more properly define the role that these genotypes may play in managing CWD in both farmed and free-ranging white-tailed deer, with consideration for factors including relative fitness levels, incubation periods, and the kinetics of shedding in animals with these rare genotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2993109420,"The aim of this study was to compare the effect of pelvic floor muscle training with surface electromyographic (sEMG) biofeedback (BF group) and Pilates exercises (P group) on the bioelectrical activity of pelvic floor muscles in women with stress urinary incontinence. The other aim aim was to compare changes in voiding diaries and scores on quality of life questionnaire against baseline values and between the groups. Women in the BF group (n = 18) participated in pelvic floor muscle training with sEMG biofeedback; the P group (n = 13) participated in basic level Pilates workouts. Both protocols were continued for eight weeks. Voiding diary, quality of life and electromyographic characteristics of the pelvic floor muscles were assessed at the three-time points: at baseline, after eight weeks’ training, and at month six post-training. The sEMG activity of the pelvic floor muscles was tested during five trials in two positions. There was no marked improvement in bioelectrical activity of the pelvic floor muscles during contraction following training with sEMG biofeedback or Pilates exercises. Following eight weeks of sEMG biofeedback training, a decrease was noted in resting bioelectrical activity of pelvic floor muscles and during relaxation after sustained contraction but only in supine-lying. No such effect was observed in the Pilates group. In the BF group, the number of incontinence episodes after end of treatment (timpepoints: 1vs. 2) and at six month follow-up (timpepoints: 1vs. 3) decreased by 68.5% and 89.3%, respectively. The respective values in the P group were 78.6%, and 86.4%. The intergroup differences did not reach the level of statistical significance. As regards the quality of life, the questionnaire demonstrated that Pilates exercises had significantly better effects compared to biofeedback training both at the end of the eight-week exercise program and (p = 0.003) and at six month follow-up (p = 0.0009). The International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire—Short Form (ICIQ- SF) showed comparable efficacy of Pilates exercises and training with sEMG biofeedback. Intragroup improvements in micturition frequency, incontinence (leakage) episodes, and nocturia frequency were comparable. Alleviation of urinary incontinence symptoms was comparable in both groups, whereas the improvement in the quality of life was more notable in the Pilates group. The obtained results failed to demonstrate the superiority of any of the two methods regarding the bioelectrical activity of pelvic floor muscles in patients with stress urinary incontinence."
https://openalex.org/W2994012844,"Heart rate can be used as a measure of cognitive engagement. We measured average student heart rates during medical school lecture classes using wristwatch-style monitors. Analysis of 42 classes showed a steady decline in heart rate from the beginning to end of a lecture class. Active learning sessions (peer-discussion based problem solving) resulted in a significant uptick in heart rate, but this returned to the average level immediately following the active learning period. This is the first statistically robust assessment of changes in heart rate during the course of college lecture classes and indicates that personal heart rate monitors may be useful tools for assessment of different teaching modalities. The key findings suggest that the value of active learning within the classroom resides in the activity itself and not in an increase in engagement or reset in attention during the didactic period following an active learning session."
https://openalex.org/W2993265301,"Background Teledermatology is a tool that provides accurate diagnosis and has been gaining more emphasis over time. It can be used for triage in primary care attention to address skin conditions improving access and reducing time to treatment for surgical, severe or even lethal diseases. Objectives Our main goal was to evaluate the proportion of pediatric patient’s lesions that could be managed using teledermatology in primary care attention. Secondly, we wanted to assess the ten most frequent skin conditions, the most common treatments and the referrals made by the teledermatologists to biopsy, in-presence dermatologist or kept at primary care attention. Methods A cross-sectional retrospective study involving 6,879 individuals and 10,126 lesions was conducted by store-and-forward teledermatology during one year in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. If the photographs taken had enough quality, teledermatologist would diagnose, treat and orient each lesion (if possible), and choose one of three options for referral: direct to biopsy, in-presence dermatologist or kept at primary care attention. Results Teledermatology managed 62% of the lesions to be kept at primary care attention, 37% were referred to dermatologists and 1% to biopsy, reducing the mean waiting time for an in-presence visit in 78%. In patients 0–2 years old, lesions related to eczema and benign congenital lesions predominated. From 3–12 years old, eczema was still a major cause of complaint, as well as warts and molluscum. From 13–19 years old, acne was the most significant problem, followed by atopic dermatitis, nevi and warts. The most frequent treatment was emollient. Conclusion Teletriage addressed 63% of the lesions without the need for an in-presence visit, suggesting that teledermatology can manage common diseases and optimize dermatological appointments for the most serious, surgical or complex skin illnesses, reducing the mean waiting time for them."
https://openalex.org/W2992563974,"Genetic modification has been used to create dairy cattle without horns and with increased resistance to disease; applications that could be beneficial for animal welfare, farm profits, and worker safety. Our aim was to assess how different stated purposes were associated with public attitudes toward these two applications using a mixed methods approach. Using an online survey, U.S. participants were randomly assigned to one of ten treatments in a 2 (application: hornless or disease-resistant) x 5 (purposes: improved animal welfare, reduced costs, increased worker safety, all three purposes, or no purpose) factorial design. Each participant was asked to read a short description of the assigned treatment (e.g. hornlessness to improve calf welfare) and then respond to a series of questions designed to assess attitude toward the treatment using 7-point Likert scales (1 = most negative; 7 = most positive). Responses of 957 participants were averaged to creative an attitude construct score. Participants were also asked to explain their response to the treatment. Qualitative analysis of these text responses was used to identify themes associated with the participants’ reasoning. Participant attitudes were more favorable to disease resistance than to hornlessness (mean ± SE attitude score: 4.5 ± 0.15 vs. 3.7 ± 0.14). In the ‘disease-resistance’ group participants had more positive attitudes toward genetic modification when the described purpose was animal welfare versus reduction of costs (contrast = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.12–1.88). Attitudes were less favorable to the ‘hornless’ application if no purpose was provided versus when the stated purpose was either to improve animal welfare (contrast = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.26–1.64) or when all purposes were provided (contrast = 0.88; 95% CI = 0.19–1.58). Similarly, attitudes were less positive when the stated purpose was to reduce costs versus either improving animal welfare (contrast = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.09–1.64) or when all purposes were provided (contrast = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.02–1.56). Quantitative and qualitative analysis indicated that both the specific application and perceived purpose (particularly when related to animal welfare) can affect public attitudes toward genetic modification."
https://openalex.org/W2991944328,"Background In 2017, the Adamawa State Primary Healthcare Development Agency introduced ALMANACH, an electronic clinical decision support system based on a modified version of IMCI. The target area was the Federal State of Adamawa (Nigeria), a region recovering after the Boko Haram insurgency. The aim of this implementation research was to assess the improvement in terms of quality care offered after one year of utilization of the tool. Methods We carried out two cross-sectional studies in six Primary Health Care Centres to assess the improvements in comparison with the baseline carried out before the implementation. One survey was carried out inside the consultation room and was based on the direct observation of 235 consultations of children aged from 2 to 59 months old. The second survey questioned 189 caregivers outside the health facility for their opinion about the consultation carried out through using the tablet, the prescriptions and medications given. Results In comparison with the baseline, more children were checked for danger signs (60.0% vs. 37.1% at baseline) and in addition, children were actually weighed (61.1% vs. 27.7%) during consultation. Malnutrition screening was performed in 35.1% of children (vs. 12.1%). Through ALMANACH, also performance of preventive measures was significantly improved (p<0.01): vaccination status was checked in 39.8% of cases (vs. 10.6% at baseline), and deworming and vitamin A prescription was increased to 46.5% (vs. 0.7%) and 48.3% (vs. 2.8%) respectively. Furthermore, children received a complete physical examination (58.3% vs. 45.5%, p<0.01) and correct treatment (48.4% vs. 29.5%, p<0.01). Regarding antibiotic prescription, 69.3% patients received at least one antibiotic (baseline 77.7%, p<0.05). Conclusions Our findings highlight major improvements in terms of quality of care despite many questions still pending to be answered in relation to a full integration of the tool in the Adamawa health system."
https://openalex.org/W2993074729,"Techniques using machine learning for short term blood glucose level prediction in patients with Type 1 Diabetes are investigated. This problem is significant for the development of effective artificial pancreas technology so accurate alerts (e.g. hypoglycemia alarms) and other forecasts can be generated. It is shown that two factors must be considered when selecting the best machine learning technique for blood glucose level regression: (i) the regression model performance metrics being used to select the model, and (ii) the preprocessing techniques required to account for the imbalanced time spent by patients in different portions of the glycemic range. Using standard benchmark data, it is demonstrated that different regression model/preprocessing technique combinations exhibit different accuracies depending on the glycemic subrange under consideration. Therefore technique selection depends on the type of alert required. Specific findings are that a linear Support Vector Regression-based model, trained with normal as well as polynomial features, is best for blood glucose level forecasting in the normal and hyperglycemic ranges while a Multilayer Perceptron trained on oversampled data is ideal for predictions in the hypoglycemic range."
https://openalex.org/W2993602862,"Introduction While the Government of Mozambique has galvanized action around exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) as a national priority, only 43% of Mozambican children under six months of age are exclusively breastfed. In the absence of skilled lactation support, challenges mothers experience with breastfeeding may inhibit initiation, exclusivity and duration. There is insufficient evidence on how to strengthen health providers’ competencies to address breastfeeding challenges in low- and middle-income countries. The objectives of this study were to 1) assess EBF challenges, from the perspectives of health providers and mothers; 2) ascertain the quality of health provider counseling to address EBF challenges; and 3) gain an understanding of the usefulness of job aids to improve counseling within routine health contact points in Nampula, Mozambique. Methods This implementation science study was conducted in Meconta and Mogovolas districts, Nampula province, Mozambique from July-November 2018. In Phase 1, 46 in-depth interviews with mothers and providers, and 11 observations of counseling sessions were conducted. In Phase 2, health providers were trained to use three job aids (i.e., facility, community or maternity contacts) to identify and address EBF problems during routine health services. In Phase 3, 30 in-depth interviews with mothers and providers were conducted to assess the experience with job aid use. In both Phase 1 and 3, we conducted a thematic analysis using a grounded theory approach involving a step-wise coding process. Results Poor latch and positioning, perceived insufficient breastmilk and breast engorgement emerged as barriers to EBF. Providers often lacked the knowledge, skillset, and self-efficacy to manage EBF problems, with little counseling provided at community or facility levels. Following job aid rollout, providers reported improved assessment of breastfeeding technique, and increased self-efficacy and motivation to identify and resolve EBF problems. Conclusions Integration of job aids, with clear lactation management guidance, into maternal and child health training curricula and supportive supervision is critical to building providers’ skillsets and competencies to provide quality lactation counseling and support."
https://openalex.org/W2992199120,"Positive fluid balance is a prognostic factor for mortality in patients with sepsis; however, the association between cumulated fluid balance (CFB) and sepsis-induced multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we sought to determine whether CFB is correlated with MODS and mortality in cases of septic shock.The study retrospectively recruited patients with septic shock from the intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) was identified as sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥ 2 in more than one organ system. The CFB is the sum of all daily intake and output. An independent t-test, single and multivariate logistic regression, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the Pearson correlation coefficient were used to determine whether a relationship exists between CFB and the development of MODS and mortality.Among the 104 patients enrolled in the study, 58 (55.8%) survived more than 28 days, and 73 (70.2%) developed MODS on day 3. The values of CFB in the first 24 hours and 72 hours after diagnosis of septic shock in patients with MODS were higher than these in patients without MODS (1086.6 ± 176.3 vs. 325.5 ± 205.7 ml, p = 0.013 and 2408 ± 361 vs. 873.1 ± 489 ml, p < 0.0001). In a multivariate logistic regression, the independent factors associated with the development of MODS on day 3 were APACHE II score at ICU admission (27.6 ± 7.6 in patients with MODS vs. 20.5 ± 6.4 in those without; O.R. 1.18; 95% C.1 I. 1.08-1.30; p < 0.001), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) (n = 28; 38.4% vs. n = 2; 6.5%; O.R. 23.67; 95% C.I. 3.58-156.5; p = 0.001), and CFB in the first 72 hours (72-hr CFB) > median (1767.50ml) (n = 41; 56.2% vs. n = 11; 35.5%; O.R. 3.67; 95% C.I., 1.18-11.40; p = 0.024). Moreover, a multivariate logistic regression also identified neoplasm (n = 25; 54.3% vs. n = 17; 29.3%; O.R. 3.45; 95% C.I. 1.23-10.0; p = 0.019) and 72-hr CFB > median (n = 30; 65.2% vs. n = 21; 36.2%; O.R. 4.13; 95% C.I. 1.34-12.66; p = 0.013) as independent factors associated with 28-day mortality. 72-hr CFB values were strongly correlated with the SOFA score (r = 0.445, p < 0.0001). The area under the ROC curve revealed that 72-hr CFB has good discriminative power in associating the development of MODS (0.644, p = 0.002) and predicting subsequent 28-day mortality (0.704, p < 0.0001).72-hr CFB appears to be correlated with the likelihood of developing MODS and mortality in patients with septic shock. Thus, it appears that 72-hr CFB could perhaps be used as an indicator for MODS and a predictor for mortality in those patients."

They were derived from a patient's cervical cancerous tissue, and are known for their heterogeneous cellular origin and variable genomic landscapes. Single-cell sequencing techniques with faithful linear and uniformly amplified genomes (DNA) and transcriptomes (RNA) may facilitate the study of cellular differences at the individual cell level. In this work, we have performed single-cell DNA and RNA sequencing with HeLa-CCL2 cells to study their heterogeneity. We have studied the complexity of copy number variations (CNVs) of HeLa-CCL2 genome at the single cell level, and revealed the transcriptomic heterogeneity of HeLa-CCL2. We also analyzed the relationship between genome and transcriptome at the single-cell level, and found overall correlation between CNV and transcriptome expression patterns. Finally, we concluded that although single-cell sequencing techniques are applicable to study heterogeneous cells such as HeLa-CCL2, the data analyses need to be more careful and well controlled."
https://openalex.org/W2990965586,"The understanding of factors affecting the gut bacterial communities in malaria vectors is essential for the design of vector control interventions, such as those based on a paratransgenic approach. One of the requirements of this method is the availability of bacteria from the mosquito susceptible to culture. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition and structure of the culturable gut bacterial communities in field mosquitoes Anopheles albimanus from Colombia, in addition to generate a bacterial collection to further analyze microbial functional activity. Gut bacteria were isolated from An. albimanus larvae and adult mosquitoes collected in localities of the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts. The bacterial isolates were grouped in 28 morphospecies that corresponded to three phyla, three classes, nine families and 14 genera. The larvae guts from San Antero (Atlantic Coast) and Buenaventura (Pacific Coast) shared the genera Bacillus and Lysinibacillus and in adults, Bacillus and Bacillus cereus Group were registered in both localities. Gut bacterial richness was higher in adults from the Pacific with respect to the Atlantic Coast, while larval richness was similar in samples of both coasts. The Shannon index indicated uniformity in morphospecies abundances in both localities. Finally, the characterization of morphospecies from the gut of Anopheles albimanus mosquitoes from Colombia by culture-dependent methods complemented with 16S rRNA gene sequencing allowed the definition, at a finer resolution, of the composition and structure of these microbial communities. In addition, the obtained bacterial culture collection will allow further evaluation of the microorganisms for their potential as biocontrol agents."
https://openalex.org/W2992619994,"Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The advent of immunobiologic therapy with TNF inhibitors agents, has been associated with a significant increase in incident cases of tuberculosis in this population. Objective To estimate the incidence of tuberculosis in patients receiving TNF inhibitors therapy for rheumatic diseases. As secondary objectives, we sought to evaluate mortality and the clinical impact of screening for latent tuberculosis infection. Methods This retrospective study included patients with rheumatic diseases of Public Health System from the Brazilian state, a high TB incidence area, who received prescriptions of TNF inhibitors agents between 2006 and 2016. Results A total of 5853 rheumatic disease patients were included. Patients were predominantly women (68.7%) aged 49.5 (± 14.7) years old. Forty-three cases of TB were found (2.86 cases per 1000 person-years; 18 times higher than in the general population). Adalimumab and certolizumab users presented a higher risk for TB development compared to etanercept users (RR: 3.11, 95%CI 1.16–8.35; 7.47, 95%CI 1.39–40.0, respectively). In a subgroup of patients, screening for latent tuberculosis infection was performed in 86% of patients, and 30.2% had a positive tuberculin skin test. Despite latent TB treatment, TB was diagnosed in 2 out of 74 (2.7%) patients. Overall, TB diagnosis did not increase mortality. Conclusion In this population-based study of rheumatic disease patients from a high incident area, TNF inhibitor exposure was associated with an 18-time increased TB incidence. Adalimumab and certolizumab were associated with greater and earlier TB diagnosis compared to etanercept."
https://openalex.org/W2991761154,"Background Behavior problems are common among children and place a high disease and financial burden on individuals and society. Parenting interventions are commonly used to prevent such problems, but little is known about their possible longer-term economic benefits. This study modelled the longer-term cost-effectiveness of five parenting interventions delivered in a Swedish context: Comet, Connect, the Incredible Years (IY), COPE, bibliotherapy, and a waitlist control, for the prevention of persistent behavior problems. Methods A decision analytic model was developed and used to forecast the cost per averted disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) by each parenting intervention and the waitlist control, for children aged 5–12 years. Age-specific cohorts were modelled until the age of 18. Educational and health care sector costs related to behavior problems were included. Active interventions were compared to the waitlist control as well as to each other. Results Intervention costs ranged between US$ 14 (bibliotherapy) to US$ 1,300 (IY) per child, with effects of up to 0.23 averted DALYs per child (IY). All parenting interventions were cost-effective at a threshold of US$ 15,000 per DALY in relation to the waitlist control. COPE and bibliotherapy strongly dominated the other options, and an additional US$ 2,629 would have to be invested in COPE to avert one extra DALY, in comparison to bibliotherapy. Conclusions Parenting interventions are cost-effective in the longer run in comparison to a waitlist control. Bibliotherapy or COPE are the most efficient options when comparing interventions to one another. Optimal decision for investment should to be based on budget considerations and priority settings."
https://openalex.org/W2991841285,"The transition from wakefulness to sleep is accompanied by widespread changes in brain functioning. Here we investigate the implications of this transition for interregional functional connectivity and their dynamic changes over time. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was used to measure brain functional activity of 21 healthy participants as they transitioned from wakefulness into sleep. fMRI volumes were independent component analysis (ICA)-decomposed, yielding 42 neurophysiological sources. Static functional connectivity (FC) was estimated from independent component time courses. A sliding window method and k-means clustering (k = 7, L2-norm) were used to estimate dynamic FC. Static FC in Wake and Stage-2 Sleep (NREM2) were largely similar. By contrast, FC dynamics across wake and sleep differed, with transitions between FC states occurring more frequently during wakefulness than during NREM2. Evidence of slower FC dynamics during sleep is discussed in relation to sleep-related reductions in effective connectivity and synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2992704481,"Standardized Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) has demonstrated efficacy in the cognitive functional neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). With regard to its underlying molecular mode of action, first evidence was provided that GBE was able to modulate neuronal outgrowth in vitro, but the mechanisms underlying GBE effects on neuroplasticity remain unclear.In this study, we investigated the effect of GBE on neurite outgrowth using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in a 2D and 3D surface culture. The effects of the GBE LI1370 on neuroplasticity and neurite outgrowth were compared to those of nerve growth factor (NGF, 50 ng/ml) which was used as a positive control. We evaluated several parameters of neurite outgrowth such as the neurite number, total neurite length and extend of branching. Our findings showed that GBE (10 and 100 μg/ml) significantly increased neurite outgrowth in the 2D as well as 3D culture model after 3 days of treatment with a comparable effect than that NGF. The use of the 3D cell culture allowed us to better reproduce the in vivo neuronal microenvironment for the evaluation the neurite formation after GBE treatment. In addition, we assessed the effects of GBE on the Akt/mTOR pathway, which is known to promote neuroplasticity induced by nerve growth factors. We showed that GBE treatment induced an increase of phosphorylated IGF1R (Tyr1135/Tyr1136), Akt (Ser473), TSC2 (Ser939), mTOR (Ser2448), PTEN (Ser380) and GSK3β (Ser9).Together, these findings indicate that GBE promotes neurite growth and activates the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway suggesting that this plant extract supports neuronal plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2993762222,"The health care system is one of the key areas where people with mental illnesses could experience stigma. Clinicians can hold stigma attitudes during their interactions with patients with mental illness. To improve the quality of mental health services and primary care, evidence-based practices should be disseminated and implemented. In this study, we evaluated the attitudes of health care providers in Bahrain toward people with mental illness and adoption of evidence-based practice using the Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Healthcare Providers (OMS-HC) and Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS). We conducted a cross-sectional study across 12 primary health care centers and a psychiatric hospital (the country's main mental health care facility). A self-report questionnaire was distributed among all health care providers. A total of 547 health care providers participated, with 274 from mental health services and 273 from primary care services. Results of the OMS-HC indicated differences between both main groups and subgroups. Regression model analysis reported significant outcomes. There was no statistical difference found between both groups in EBPAS scores. A weak but statistically significant negative association was reported between both scales. Participants showed varying stigma attitudes across different working environments, with less stigma shown in mental health services than in primary care services. Providers who were more open to adopting evidence-based practices showed less stigma toward people with mental illness. Comparing our findings with previous research showed that health care providers in Bahrain hold more stigma attitudes than other groups studied. We hope that this study serves as an initial step toward future campaigns against the stigma of mental illness in Bahrain and across the region."
https://openalex.org/W2990133948,"Traditional urodynamics have poor correlation with urological symptoms. Ambulatory urodynamics may improve this correlation but the need for a transurethral catheter and the time-consuming nature of this examination limits its use. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a wireless real-time bladder pressure measurement device for repeated and prolonged-term measurement of bladder behavior in awake pigs. The Bladder Pill is an intravesical device with a pressure microsensor and a 3-dimensional inductive coupling coil for energy supply. A corresponding external coil provides wireless power transmission and real-time communication of bladder pressure data. To test the correlation between the pressure data measured by the device and by standard methods, we compared static water column pressures with this device and water-filled urodynamic catheter systems. In vivo assessment of awake voiding by the pill was done by introducing the bladder pill into the bladder of Göttingen minipigs. An air-charged urodynamic catheter was introduced transurethrally as control for pressure measurements. The optimal physical configuration of the pill was investigated to maximize the containment in the bladder. We used two versions of external signal receivers (one waistband and one rectangular frame) to test the optimal external signal capture. Next to that, we performed short-term and medium-term comparative pressure studies. The in vitro static pressure measurement demonstrated a mean difference of less than 1 cm H2O between the methods. The optimal design of the pill for maximal retainment in the bladder proved to be a pigtail configuration. The bending of the device during bladder contractions caused offset of 2.7 +/- 1.4 cm H2O (mean +/- SD) on the pressure measurements. The rectangular frame performed signal capture during 5 consecutive voids with a good correlation of the pressure measurements. The device can be inserted through the urethra and is retrieved using string or endoscopic extraction. In conclusion, wireless long-term measurement of bladder pressure is demonstrated and yields comparable results to current available catheter methods of measurement in a pig model."
https://openalex.org/W2993281755,"Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is capable of transient viremia and extrapulmonary dissemination. Recently, this virus has been identified in fetal cord blood, suggesting the possibility of in utero acquisition in humans. Here, we assess permissivity and kinetics of RSV replication in primary human placental cells, examine their potential to transfer this infection to neighboring cells, and measure the inflammatory response evoked by the virus. Methods and findings Human placental villus tissue was collected immediately upon delivery and processed for isolation of placental cytotrophoblast, fibroblast, and macrophage (Hofbauer) cells. Isolated cells were infected with a recombinant RSV-A2 strain (rrRSV) expressing red fluorescent protein (RFP) and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, Western blot, and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Based on RFP expression, rrRSV exhibited differential tropism for the three major placental cell types. Placental fibroblasts and Hofbauer cells were permissive and supported productive rrRSV replication. While infected cytotrophoblast cells expressed viral glycoprotein (G protein), only limited RSV replication was detected. Importantly, qPCR and fluorescence-focused unit assay revealed that the viral progeny remains trapped within infected Hofbauer cells for up to 30 days, with no release into surrounding media. Yet, Hofbauer cells passed the infection onto overlaid naïve 16HBE cells, suggesting contact-dependent trans-infection. Lastly, a significant increase in proinflammatory cytokines, particularly IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma was measured in the supernatant of infected Hofbauer cells by multiplex cytokine assay and conventional ELISA. Conclusions This study demonstrates that RSV can replicate in human placenta, exhibits differential tropism for distinct placental cell types, can be stored and transferred to neighboring cells by Hofbauer cells, and elicits an inflammatory response. It also supports the hypothesis that this respiratory virus can be vertically transferred to the fetus and potentially affect its development and the outcome of pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2992069416,"Tonsil-derived mesenchymal stem cells (TMSC) have characteristics of MSC and have many advantages. In our previous studies, intraperitoneal (IP) injection of TMSC in acute and chronic colitis mouse models improved the disease activity index, colon length, and the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines. However, TMSC were not observed to migrate to the inflammation site in the intestine. The aim of this study was to verify the therapeutic effect of conditioned medium (CM) released by TMSC (TMSC-CM) in a mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis. TMSC-CM was used after seeding 5×105 cells onto a 100 mm dish and culturing for 5–7 days. TMSC-CM was concentrated (TMSC-CM-conc) by three times using a 100 kDa cut-off centrifugal filter. Seven-week-old C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to the following 5 groups: 1) normal, 2) colitis, 3) TMSC, 4) TMSC-CM, and 5) TMSC-CM-conc. Chronic colitis was induced by continuous oral administration of 1.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 5 days, followed by 5 additional days of tap water feeding. This cycle was repeated two more times (total 30 days). Phosphate buffered saline (in the colitis group), TMSC, TMSC-CM, and TMSC-CM-conc were injected via IP route 4, 4, 12, and 4 times, respectively. Reduction of disease activity index, weight gain, recovery of colon length, and decreased in the expression level of the proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 were observed at day 30 in the treatment groups, compared to control. However, histological colitis scoring and the expression level of tumor necrosis factor α and IL-10 did not differ significantly between each group. TMSC-CM showed an equivalent effect to TMSC related to the improvement of inflammation in the chronic colitis mouse model. The data obtained support the use of TMSC-CM to treat inflammatory bowel disease without any cell transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2993110874,"The data regarding resources and environmental carrying capacities (RECC) are not only the basis for realizing regional sustainable development, but also the core links for major function-oriented zoning practices, which include specific partitioning schemes of spatial units with various geographical functions. Previously, relevant studies were mainly based on the evaluations of single factors. However, the realization of regional function-oriented spatial zoning practices based on comprehensive assessments of RECC has been neglected. This study presented an evaluation index system for RECC based on nine aspects, in accordance with the evaluation elements of the major function-oriented zoning programs which were in place and the characteristics of the study area. Then, by using subjective and objective comprehensive weighting methods, the basic elements were finally integrated, and an accurate spatial distribution pattern of the RECC in China’s Fengxian County was obtained. In addition, based on the construction of a three-dimensional spatial conceptual model, this study was able to finally obtain four specific types of functional partitions in the study areas, and proposed specific development proposals according to the different types of functional zoning from a systemic perspective. It was observed that the RECC had been decreasing from a central built-up area to the surrounding townships, and the spatial distribution patterns were distinctly scattered. In addition, the townships with smaller land scales had more obvious advantages in the RECC. However, fluctuating upward trends were observed after the lowest thresholds had been reached as for the medium or above medium scales. At the same time, in terms of the correlations between the population levels, and gross values and the RECC, fluctuating characteristics were observed. The correlations with the latter had presented S-shape curves and inverted U-shape curves, respectively. Finally, the optimized expansion zone located in the north-central region had taken the greatest percentage among functional zoning classifications, followed by the basic competitive zone in the southwestern section. However, the main construction zone accounted for the smallest proportion, at only 2.065%. Therefore, based on these results, it was concluded that there were certain fluctuating correlations between the RECC and total population levels, economic levels, and land scales. Moreover, the RECC evaluation results were found to gradually decrease after rising to the thresholds under the comprehensive effects of the various factors. This study combined the data of the conceptual model with the RECC evaluation results, in order to obtain a potential geographical functional zoning program for the study area. The results of this study are expected to provide a new analysis perspective for the scientific and sustainable development of small-scale geographic units. Moreover, on the basis of this study’s comprehensive evaluations of the RECC, the directions of regional development can be further clarified."

Tactile (exploratory probe) and evaporative (triple syringe) stimuli were used to measure DH and were recorded with the aid of a visual analogue scale (VAS) after the 1st, 2nd and 3rd treatment sessions and one-month follow-up. The HRQL was recorded in the DH experience questionnaire (DHEQ).The intragroup comparison showed a significant reduction in DH (p < 0.05) with both stimuli after one-month follow-up. The intergroup comparison with the evaporative stimulus showed that CPP-ACPF+PBM significantly reduced DH when compared to the rest of treatments, after one-month follow-up. CPP-ACPF+PBM group statistically differed from the other treatment groups in the DHEQ evaluation after one-month follow-up.After one-month follow-up, the association of CPP-ACPF with PBM was effective in the reduction of DH and promoted a positive impact on the HRQL of the participants of this study."

Existing transplant biomarkers are often not sensitive enough to detect acute or chronic rejection at an early enough stage to allow successful clinical intervention. We herein developed a cell-based sensor that can potentially be used for monitoring local events following liver transplantation. Utilizing a machine perfusion system as a platform to engraft the cells into a donor liver, we effectively established the biocompatibility of the biosensor cells and confirmed efficient delivery of cells distributed throughout the organ. This work proves an innovative concept of integrating synthetic reporter cells ex vivo into organs as a transplant-within-a-transplant during functional organ preservation with a vision to use cell biosensors as a broad way to monitor and treat tissue transplants."
https://openalex.org/W2991936633,"Direct transmission of bacteria to subsequent generations highlights the beneficial nature of host-bacteria relationships. In insects, this process is often mediated by the production of microbe-containing secretions. The objective of this study was to determine if the burying beetle, Nicrophorus defodiens, utilizes anal secretions to transmit adult digestive tract bacteria onto a small vertebrate carcass; thus creating the potential to aid in carcass preservation or pass digestive tract bacteria to their larval offspring. Using high-throughput Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, we characterized bacterial communities of adult beetle digestive tracts, their anal secretions, and prepared mouse carcasses. We also examined unprepared carcass bacterial communities as a means to interpret community shifts that take place during carcass preservation. We found a vast reduction in diversity on prepared carcasses after anal secretion application. Overall, there was little similarity in bacterial communities among adult digestive tracts, anal secretions, and prepared carcasses, suggesting bacterial communities found in adult digestive tracts do not successfully colonize and achieve dominance on prepared carcasses by way of beetle anal secretions. We concluded that N. defodiens does not transmit their digestive tract bacterial communities to prepared carcasses in a wholesale manner, but may transmit key microbes, including core microbiome members, to preserved carcasses that may ultimately act to sustain larvae and serve as inocula for larval digestive tracts."
https://openalex.org/W2993072123,"Congenital amusia, commonly known as tone deafness, is a lifelong impairment of music perception and production. It remains a question of debate whether the impairments in musical domain observed in congenital amusia are paralleled in other non-musical perceptual abilities. Using behavioral measures in two experiments, the current study explored face perception and memory in congenital amusics. Both congenital amusics and matched controls performed a face perception task (Experiment 1) and an old/novel object memory task (for both faces and houses, Experiment 2). The results showed that the congenital amusic group had significantly slower reaction times than that in matched control group when identifying whether two faces presented together were the same or different. For different face-pairs, the deficit was greater for upright faces compared with inverted faces. For object memory task, the congenital amusic group also showed worse memory performance than the control group. The results of the present study suggest that the impairment attributed to congenital amusia is not only limited to music, but also extends to visual perception and visual memory domain."
https://openalex.org/W2993426293,"Background 
Serious psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been associated with environmental exposures in early life. Contact with household pets such as cats and dogs can serve as a source of environmental exposure during these time periods.


Methods 
We investigated the relationship between exposure to a household pet cat or dog during the first 12 years of life and having a subsequent diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. These studies were performed in a cohort of 396 individuals with schizophrenia, 381 with bipolar disorder, and 594 controls. The hazards of developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder associated with first exposure to a household pet cat or dog were calculated using Cox Proportional Hazard and multivariate logistic regression models including socio-demographic covariates.


Results 
We found that exposure to a household pet dog was associated with a significantly decreased hazard of having a subsequent diagnosis of schizophrenia (Hazard Ratio .75, p < .002) Furthermore, a significant decreased relative risk of schizophrenia was detected following exposure at birth and during the first years of life. There was no significant relationship between household exposure to a pet dog and bipolar disorder. There were no significant associations between exposure to a household pet cat and subsequent risk of either a schizophrenia or bipolar disorder diagnosis. However, there were trends towards an increased risk of both disorders at defined periods of exposure.


Conclusions 
Exposure to household pets during infancy and childhood may be associated with altered rates of development of psychiatric disorders in later life."
https://openalex.org/W2993514836,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, remitting, and relapsing, inflammatory disease involving multiple organs, which exhibits abnormalities of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. A limited number of transcriptomic studies have characterized the gene pathways involved in SLE in an attempt to identify the key pathogenic drivers of the disease. In order to further advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of SLE, we used a novel Bayesian network algorithm to hybridize knowledge- and data-driven methods, and then applied the algorithm to build an SLE gene network using transcriptomic data from 1,760 SLE patients’ RNA from the two tabalumab Phase III trials (ILLUMINATE-I & -II), the largest SLE RNA dataset to date. Further, based on the gene network, we carried out hub- and key driver-gene analyses for gene prioritization. Our analyses identified that the JAK-STAT pathway genes, including JAK2, STAT1, and STAT2, played essential roles in SLE pathogenesis, and reaffirmed the recent discovery of pathogenic relevance of JAK-STAT signaling in SLE. Additionally, we showed that other genes, such as IRF1, IRF7, PDIA4, FAM72C, TNFSF10, DHX58, SIGLEC1, and PML, may be also important in SLE and serve as potential therapeutic targets for SLE. In summary, using a hybridized network construction approach, we systematically investigated gene-gene interactions based on their transcriptomic profiles, prioritized genes based on their importance in the network structure, and revealed new insights into SLE activity."

Spatial analysis found the relationship between these intake locations and the final disposition of the dogs to be non-random, suggesting social and environmental influences on distribution. Statistically significant clusters were identified using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. This study found statistically significant hot spots (i.e., areas with higher than expected values) and cold spots (i.e., areas with lower than expected values) for the intake of dogs with known health issues, physically neglected dogs, juveniles, and adults. Only statistically significant hot spots were found for socially neglected dogs and dogs whose final disposition was euthanasia due to severe health or behavioral issues. Given the close relationship between humans and dogs, this study explores the association of impounded dog clusters and a previously developed social vulnerability index. Social vulnerability is the product of social inequalities and inequalities related to the human-built environment. The social vulnerability index provides one tool for understanding the differences in characteristics of dogs from different intake locations. Results of this study indicate the utility of non-animal focused data as a planning tool for community programs and to allow for efficient allocation of limited resources for veterinary and other community outreach programs."
https://openalex.org/W2992376566,"The gut plays a vital role in critical illness, and alterations in the gut structure and function have been reported in endotoxemia and sepsis models. Previously, we have demonstrated a novel link between the diet-induced alteration of the gut microbiome with cellulose and improved outcomes in sepsis. As compared to mice receiving basal fiber (BF) diet, mice that were fed a non-fermentable high fiber (HF) diet demonstrated significant improvement in survival and decreased organ injury in both cecal-ligation and puncture (CLP) and endotoxin sepsis models. To understand if the benefit conferred by HF diet extends to the gut structure and function, we hypothesized that HF diet would be associated with a reduction in sepsis-induced gut epithelial loss and permeability in mice. We demonstrate that the use of dietary cellulose decreased LPS-mediated intestinal hyperpermeability and protected the gut from apoptosis. Furthermore, we noted a significant increase in epithelial cell proliferation, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of bromodeoxyuridine-positive cells in HF fed mice as compared to BF fed mice. Thus, the use of HF diet is a simple and effective tool that confers benefit in a murine model of sepsis, and understanding the intricate relationship between the epithelial barrier, gut microbiota, and diet will open-up additional therapeutic avenues for the treatment of gut dysfunction in critical illness."
https://openalex.org/W2993316031,"Purpose In partially accommodative esotropia (PAET), prism glasses can correct small angles of residual esotropia but the long-term effect of prismatic correction alone without surgery has not been reported. We aimed to investigate the long-term outcome of prism glasses after full hypermetropic correction for PAET. Methods This retrospective, case-control study was performed for children aged 10 years or younger with a residual esotropia of ≤ 20 prism diopters (PD) after full hypermetropic correction who were fitted with prism glasses and followed-up for 3 years or more. Clinical characteristics and the angle of esodeviation were obtained at each follow-up examination. Successful motor outcome after 3 years of prismatic correction was determined if the residual angle of esotropia after full hypermetropic correction was ≤ 10PD. Patients who eventually weaned off prism glasses were noted. Results Among 124 patients, 30.6% achieved success and 7.3% weaned off prism glasses after 3 years of prism-wear. Smaller amount of latent esodeviation (P = 0.001) revealed by prism adaptation and good fusional response at near with the Worth 4-dot test were significant prognostic factors of success by multivariate analysis (P = 0.033). After 3 years of wearing prism glasses, the rate of improvement in stereoacuity was higher in the Success group (60.5% vs 27.9%) (P = 0.001), however, there was no significant difference between the prism-weaned group and prism-wearing group within the Success group (P>0.05). Conclusion Prism glasses for small angle PAET can be a treatment option in patients who have a small angle of latent esodeviation revealed by prism adaptation and good sensory fusion at near. Otherwise, early surgery may be advisable as the majority of patients showed suboptimal outcome even after long-term prism-wear."
https://openalex.org/W2992651881,"While prediction models can estimate an infant's risk of developing obesity at a later point in early childhood, caregiver receptiveness to such information is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the acceptability of these models to New Zealand caregivers.An anonymous questionnaire was distributed online. The questionnaire consisted of multiple choice and Likert scale questions. Respondents were parents, caregivers, and grandparents of children aged ≤5 years.1,934 questionnaires were analysed. Responses were received from caregivers of various ethnicities and levels of education. Nearly two-thirds (62.1%) of respondents would ""definitely"" or ""probably"" want to hear if their infant was at risk of early childhood obesity, although ""worried"" (77.0%) and ""upset"" (53.0%) were the most frequently anticipated responses to such information. With lower mean scores reflecting higher levels of acceptance, grandparents (mean score = 1.67) were more receptive than parents (2.10; p = 0.0002) and other caregivers (2.13; p = 0.021); males (1.83) were more receptive than females (2.11; p = 0.005); and Asian respondents (1.68) were more receptive than those of European (2.05; p = 0.003), Māori (2.11; p = 0.002), or Pacific (2.03; p = 0.042) ethnicities. There were no differences in acceptance according to socioeconomic status, levels of education, or other ethnicities.Almost two-thirds of respondents were receptive to communication regarding their infant's risk of childhood obesity. While our results must be interpreted with some caution due to their hypothetical nature, findings suggest that if delivered in a sensitive manner to minimise caregiver distress, early childhood obesity risk prediction could be a useful tool to inform interventions to reduce childhood obesity in New Zealand."
https://openalex.org/W2994375959,"In Huntington’s disease (HD), striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) are particularly sensitive to the presence of a CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene. However, there are many evidences that cells from the peripheral immune system and central nervous system (CNS) immune cells, namely microglia, play an important role in the etiology and the progression of HD. However, it remains unclear whether MSNs neurodegeneration is mediated by a non-cell autonomous mechanism. The homeostasis in the healthy CNS is maintained by several mechanisms of interaction between all brain cells. Neurons can control microglia activation through several inhibitory mechanisms, such as the CD200–CD200R1 interaction. Due to the complete lack of knowledge about the CD200–CD200R1 system in HD, we determined the temporal patterns of CD200 and CD200R1 expression in the neocortex, hippocampus and striatum in the HD mouse models R6/1 and HdhQ111/7 from pre-symptomatic to manifest stages. In order to explore any alteration in the peripheral immune system, we also studied the levels of expression of CD200 and CD200R1 in whole blood. Although CD200R1 expression was not altered, we observed and increase in CD200 gene expression and protein levels in the brain parenchyma of all the regions we examined, along with HD pathogenesis in R6/1 mice. Interestingly, the expression of CD200 mRNA was also up-regulated in blood following a similar temporal pattern. These results suggest that canonical neuronal–microglial communication through CD200–CD200R1 interaction is not compromised, and CD200 up-regulation in R6/1 brain parenchyma could represent a neurotrophic signal to sustain or extend neuronal function in the latest stages of HD as pro-survival mechanism."

This study aims to identify the different types of social interactions that occur during a multi-day, ultra-race and to understand how these interactions influence ultra-runners' race experience.Athletes competing in Britain's ""Spine Race"" were recruited for the current study. Twelve male runners aged between 32 and 66 years (M = 50; SD = 10.01) followed the qualitative protocol designed for the study. Specifically, each participant completed a modified version of the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) instrument and underwent a post-race, self-confrontation interview. Participants were asked to recall and reconstruct their memories about their (a) actions (e.g., What did you do when you encountered other people?); (b) thoughts (e.g., What were your thoughts when you encountered other people?) and (c) feelings (e.g., What were your feelings when you encountered other people?).The results show that social interactions and interpersonal relationships are common in ultra-races. Different groups of people play an important role in racers' motivation and goal achievement: fellow racers, volunteers, medics, friends and family, and even the general public. The resulting social interactions and relationships can occur before, during and after the race in both online and offline environments. These social influences have a powerful influence on the athlete's race experience.The vast majority of social interactions reported by runners had a positive effect on their race experience and often led to interpersonal relationships.

https://openalex.org/W2992633069,"The community structure and assemblages of marine benthic organisms were investigated in coastal areas near the Jang Bogo Antarctic Research Station in Terra Nova Bay during the 2012-2018 summer seasons. We also examined the recovery pattern of marine benthic organisms following disturbance due to the construction of the Jang Bogo Station. A total of 26 taxa were identified in the study area during the experimental period. Species number and diversity indices (richness, evenness, and diversity) were relatively low compared to data previously reported from Terra Nova Bay. Sphaerotylus antarcticus, Clavularia frankliniana, Hydractinia sp., Iridaea cordata, Fragilariopsis spp., Alcyonium antarcticum, and Metalaeospira pixelli were the dominant species in this area. Of these, the diatom Fragilariopsis spp. were the most abundant species, indicating their key role in maintaining the marine benthic community and controlling biogeochemical cycling. During the construction of the Jang Bogo Station, sediment coverage increased and diatoms declined due to the release of sediment into the coastal area. In February 2014, one month after the disturbance due to cyclone, the diatom coverage increased dramatically and thereby species number, richness index, and diversity index steadily rose from 2015 to 2018. However, non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination analysis of species similarities among sampling times showed that community structure had not completely recovered by 2018. Thus, long-term monitoring is required to elucidate the post-disturbance settlement mechanisms of marine benthic organisms at the study area in Terra Nova Bay."
https://openalex.org/W2992734699,"This paper proposes an emergency Traffic Adaptive MAC (eTA-MAC) protocol for WBANs based on Prioritization. The main advantage of the protocol is to provide traffic ranking through a Traffic Class Prioritization-based slotted-Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (TCP-CSMA/CA) scheme. The emergency traffic is handled through Emergency Traffic Class Provisioning-based slotted-CSMA/CA (ETCP-CSMA/CA) scheme. The emergency-based traffic adaptivity is provided through Emergency-based Traffic Adaptive slotted-CSMA/CA (ETA-CSMA/CA) scheme. The TCP-CSMA/CA scheme assigns a distinct, minimized and prioritized backoff period range to each traffic class in every backoff during channel access in Contention Access Period (CAP). The ETCP-CSMA/CA scheme delivers the sporadic emergency traffic that occurs at a single or multiple BMSN(s) instantaneously, with minimum delay and packet loss. It does this while being aware of normal traffic in the CAP. Then, the ETA-CSMA/CA scheme creates a balance between throughput and energy in the sporadic emergency situation with energy preservation of normal traffic BMSNs. The proposed protocol is evaluated using NS-2 simulator. The results indicate that the proposed protocol is better than the existing Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols by 86% decrease in packet delivery delay, 61% increase in throughput, and a 76% decrease in energy consumption."
https://openalex.org/W2993226504,"Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is widely known as deleterious for many organisms since it can cause damage to biomolecules either directly or indirectly via the formation of reactive oxygen species. The goal of this study was to analyze the capacity of high-mountain Espeletia hartwegiana plant phyllosphere microorganisms to survive UVR and to identify genes related to resistance strategies. A strain of Deinococcus swuensis showed a high survival rate of up to 60% after UVR treatment at 800J/m2 and was used for differential expression analysis using RNA-seq after exposing cells to 400J/m2 of UVR (with >95% survival rate). Differentially expressed genes were identified using the R-Bioconductor package NOISeq and compared with other reported resistance strategies reported for this genus. Genes identified as being overexpressed included transcriptional regulators and genes involved in protection against damage by UVR. Non-coding (nc)RNAs were also differentially expressed, some of which have not been previously implicated. This study characterized the immediate radiation response of D. swuensis and indicates the involvement of ncRNAs in the adaptation to extreme environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2993440290,"Introduction Urocortin 2 (Ucn2) is a 38-amino acid peptide of the corticotropin-releasing factor family. Intravenous (IV) delivery of an adeno-associated virus vector serotype 8 encoding Ucn2 (AAV8.Ucn2) increases insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal in mice with insulin resistance. Objective To determine the effects of Ucn2 on liver metabolome. Methods Six-week-old C57BL6 mice were divided into normal chow (CHOW)-fed and high fat diet (HFD)-fed groups. The animals received saline, AAV8 encoding no gene (AAV8.Empt) or AAV8.Ucn2 (2x1013 genome copy/kg, IV injection). Livers were isolated from CHOW-fed and HFD-fed mice and analyzed by untargeted metabolomics. Group differences were statistically analyzed. Results In CHOW-fed mice, AAV8.Ucn2 gene transfer (vs. saline) altered the metabolites in glycolysis, pentose phosphate, glycogen synthesis, glycogenolysis, and choline-folate-methionine signaling pathways. In addition, AAV8.Ucn2 gene transfer increased amino acids and peptides, which were associated with reduced protein synthesis. In insulin resistant (HFD-induced) mice, HFD (vs CHOW) altered 448 (112 increased and 336 decreased) metabolites and AAV8.Ucn2 altered 239 metabolites (124 increased and 115 reduced) in multiple pathways. There are 61 metabolites in 5 super pathways showed interactions between diet and AAV8.Ucn2 treatment. Among them, AAV8.Ucn2 gene transfer reversed HFD effects on 13 metabolites. Finally, plasma Ucn2 effects were determined using a 3-group comparison of HFD-fed mice that received AAV8.Ucn2, AAV.Empt or saline, where 18 metabolites that altered by HFD (15 increased and 3 decreased), but restored levels to that seen in CHOW-fed mice by increased plasma Ucn2. Conclusions Metabolomics study revealed that AAV8.Ucn2 gene transfer, through increased plasma Ucn2, provided counter-HFD effects in restoring hepatic metabolites to normal levels, which could be the underlying mechanisms for Ucn2 effects on increasing glucose disposal and reducing insulin assistance."

To improve data quality, researchers may use scoring rules that reward respondents so that it is most profitable for them to tell the truth.

The primary end point was to evaluate the impact of advanced age on clinical response and cardiovascular and total mortality of patients undergoing CRT. The secondary end point was to assess the rate of acute complications related to the procedure. Methods and results A total of 249 consecutive patients with HF and optimized treatment, QRS ≥ 120 ms, ejection fraction (EF) ≤ 35% and functional class (FC) III/ IV (NYHA) underwent CRT and divided into 3 groups: Group I—< 65 years—88/ 249 (35%); Group II– 65 to 75 years (old)– 72/ 249 (29%); Group III—≥ 75 years (very old)– 89/ 249 (36%). The improvement in FC and increase in EF (>10%) and/ or decrease in the left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD) >15% were the criteria of responsiveness. The favorable clinical response (p = ns) and cardiovascular mortality (p = 0.737) was similar in the 3 groups. In the group of very old patients, a significant increase in total mortality was observed (p = 0.03). The rate of acute complications related to the procedure did not differ between the groups (p = ns). Conclusion The response to CRT and cardiovascular mortality were not affected by the advanced age and should not be an exclusion factor of this therapy. The procedure has been shown to be safe in elderly patients due to low rate of acute complications."

More specifically, what makes political elites be devoted to or not be devoted to local public goods provision? This study, using basic education provision as an example, intends to gauge the impact of leadership selection on public goods provision in China. It is found that career trajectories of politicians have a bearing on basic education provision. The findings suggest that even under a top-down appointment system, homegrown politicians are more willing to cater to local preferences, especially on basic education provision, which suggests an extension of Riker’s theory, applied in a non-democratic regime. Numerous studies have examined the impacts of decentralization on a variety of aspects of public governance in different contexts. Nevertheless, the unique contribution of this study is its policy implication that political centralization may not be an effective solution for local public governance even in an authoritarian context."
https://openalex.org/W2993015887,"In this paper we define the concept of the Machine Learning Morphism (MLM) as a fundamental building block to express operations performed in machine learning such as data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training. Inspired by statistical learning, MLMs are morphisms whose parameters are minimized via a risk function. We explore operations such as composition of MLMs and when sets of MLMs form a vector space. These operations are used to build a machine learning workflow from data preprocessing to final task completion. We examine the Mapper Algorithm from Topological Data Analysis as an MLM, and build several workflows for binary classification incorporating Mapper on Hospital Readmissions and Credit Evaluation datasets. The advantage of this framework lies in the ability to easily build, organize, and compare multiple workflows, and allows joint optimization of parameters across multiple steps in an application."

We apply an idea from neuroeconomics to this problem, suggesting that how people subjectively value facial expressions should predict usage differences during unconstrained interaction. Specifically, we ask whether the subjective value of smiles is malleable as a consequence of immediate social experience and how this relates to smiling during face-to-face interactions. We measured the value of a smile in monetary terms and found that increases in people’s social neediness caused devaluation of polite smiles but no changes in how they valued genuine smiles. This result predicts that participants induced to feel high levels of social need should be less responsive to their social partners’ polite smiles in a subsequent unconstrained social interaction. As expected, high social-need participants returned fewer polite smiles when interacting with a partner, leading to poor interaction outcomes. Genuine smile reciprocity remained unchanged. Findings show that social states influence real-world interactions by changing social-cue valuation, highlighting a potential mechanism for understanding the moment-to-moment control of social behaviour and how behaviour changes based on people’s subjective evaluations of the social environment."
https://openalex.org/W2993078522,"Rapid sample preparation is one of the leading bottlenecks to low-cost and efficient sample component detection. To overcome this setback, a technology known as Lyse-It has been developed to rapidly (less than 60 seconds) lyse Gram-positive and–negative bacteria alike, while simultaneously fragmenting DNA/RNA and proteins into tunable sizes. This technology has been used with a variety of organisms, but the underlying mechanism behind how the technology actually works to fragment DNA/RNA and proteins has hitherto been studied. It is generally understood how temperature affects cellular lysing, but for DNA/RNA and protein degradation, the temperature and amount of energy introduced by microwave irradiation of the sample, cannot explain the degradation of the biomolecules to the extent that was being observed. Thus, an investigation into the microwave generation of reactive oxygen species, in particular singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and superoxide anion radicals, was undertaken. Herein, we probe one aspect, the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is thought to contribute to a non-thermal mechanism behind biomolecule fragmentation with the Lyse-It technology. By utilizing off/on (Photoinduced electron transfer) PET fluorescent-based probes highly specific for reactive oxygen species, it was found that as oxygen concentration in the sample and/or microwave irradiation power increases, more reactive oxygen species are generated and ultimately, more oxidation and biomolecule fragmentation occurs within the microwave cavity."
https://openalex.org/W2992763117,"Cooperation is widespread across the tree of life, with examples ranging from vertebrates to lichens to multispecies biofilms. The initial evolution of such cooperation is likely to involve interactions that produce non-additive fitness effects among small groups of individuals in local populations. However, most models for the evolution of cooperation have focused on genealogically related individuals, assume that the factors influencing individual fitness are deterministic, that populations are very large, and that the benefits of cooperation increase linearly with the number of cooperative interactions. Here we show that stochasticity and non-additive interactions can facilitate the evolution of cooperation in small local groups. We derive a generalized model for the evolution of cooperation and show that if cooperation reduces the variance in individual fitness (separate from its effect on average fitness), this can aid in the evolution of cooperation through directional stochastic effects. In addition, we show that the potential for the evolution of cooperation is influenced by non-additivity in benefits with cooperation being more likely to evolve when the marginal benefit of a cooperative act increases with the number of such acts. Our model compliments traditional cooperation models (kin selection, reciprocal cooperation, green beard effect, etc.) and applies to a broad range of cooperative interactions seen in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2993934190,"Similarity in community composition declines as distance between locations increases, a phenomenon that has been observed in a wide variety of freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems. One driver of the distance-similarity relationship is the presence of environmental gradients that alter the suitability of sites for particular species. Although some environmental gradients, such as geology, do not change on a year-to-year basis, others, such as temperature, vary annually and over longer time periods. Here, we used a 21-year dataset of fish communities in the upper Mississippi River to examine the effect of distance on variation in community composition and to assess whether the effect of distance is primarily due to its effect on thermal regime. Because the Mississippi River is aligned mostly north-to-south, larger distances along the river roughly correspond to larger differences in latitude and therefore thermal regime. As expected, there was a moderate distance-similarity relationship, suggesting greater distance leads to less similarity. The effect of distance appeared to increase slightly over time. Using a subset of data for which air temperature was available, we compared models that incorporated both difference among sites in degree days (a surrogate for thermal regime) and physical distance (river km). Although physical distance presumably incorporates more environmental gradients than just temperature (and other potential mechanisms), temperature alone appears to be more strongly associated with differences in the Mississippi River fish community than distance."
https://openalex.org/W2994360802,"Purpose The aim of the present study was to describe the profiles of a sample of young cannabis users not seeking care, for use in general practice in France. Methods In this cross-sectional study, baseline data were used from a previous clinical randomized trial, in which a brief intervention was tested. The participants were 262 cannabis users aged 15 to 25 years who smoked at least one joint per month. Assessment was undertaken both by the GP and via an anonymous self-reporting questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata software and R. We used multiple correspondence analysis to determine the profiles of users. Results Among the 262 patients, 46.2% were daily users (more than 30 joints per month), 25.6% were regular users (from 10 to 29 joints per month), and 28.2% were recent users (fewer than 10 joints per month). The higher the frequency of use, the greater the incidence of unaccompanied use, daily use and week use (p from <0.001 to 0.01). The motivations of daily users were mostly self-treatment and habit (p <0.05). The cannabis abuse screening trial score revealed risky use for 87.5% of daily users and 34.4% for recent users. Factorial analysis identified 5 profiles according to age, risk, and motive for use. The reasons for consultation were equally distributed among users regardless of their level of use or their profile (p > 0.05). Conclusions The results provide support for the practice of asking young patients systematically about their cannabis use, allowing GPs to identify users who require medical care. GPs should consider the differences between participants according to their profile in order to determine the appropriate type of care. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01433692."
