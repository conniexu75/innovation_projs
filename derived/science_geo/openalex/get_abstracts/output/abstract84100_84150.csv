Cultured mammalian cells transfected with this hybrid plasmid produced infectious poliovirus. Cells transfected with a plasmid which lacked the first 115 bases of the poliovirus genome did not produce virus."

Initial results indicated two patterns of processing the injected DNA: one in which the material was not integrated into the host genome, and another in which the injected genes became associated with high molecular weight DNA. These patterns are maintained through further development to adulthood. The evidence presented indicates the covalent association of injected DNA with host sequences, and transmission of such linked sequences in a Mendelian distribution to two succeeding generations of progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2089726928,"A DNA sequence coding for the immunogenic capsid protein VP3 of foot-and-mouth disease virus A12, prepared from the virion RNA, was ligated to a plasmid designed to express a chimeric protein from the Escherichia coli tryptophan promoter-operator system. When Escherichia coli transformed with this plasmid was grown in tryptophan-depleted media, approximately 17 percent of the total cellular protein was found to be an insoluble and stable chimeric protein. The purified chimeric protein competed equally on a molar basis with VP3 for specific antibodies to foot-and-mouth disease virus. When inoculated into six cattle and two swine, this protein elicited high levels of neutralizing antibody and protection against challenge with foot-and-mouth disease virus."

https://openalex.org/W1520282358,"The biosynthesis and degradation of the cell surface transferrin receptor has been investigated. The receptor is a glycoprotein, and evidence is presented that the mature receptor contains both complex and high mannose N-asparagine-linked oligosaccharides that are synthesized via a common high mannose intermediate as previously described for other glycoproteins. It is shown that fatty acid is associated with only the mature form of the receptor and that addition of fatty acid to the receptor and that addition of fatty acid to the receptor can occur as long as 48 h after synthesis. Glycosylation is not an absolute requirement for the receptor to act as acceptor for fatty acid, nor for transport to the cell surface, although the efficiency of both processes may be reduced in tunicamycin-treated cells. The protein moiety of the transferrin receptor is degraded with a half-life of approximately 60 h."
https://openalex.org/W1554009894,"The role of superoxide radicals in biological damage in the presence of copper(II) ions has been investigated. Solutions of purified penicillinase in phosphate buffer, saturated with either air N/sub 2/, N/sub 2/O, or N/sub 2/O/O/sub 2/, were..gamma..-irradiated in the presence and in the absence of formate. The residual activity of the enzyme in catalyzing the cleavage of the..beta..-lactam ring of benzylpenicillin, was then monitored. The results indicate that in metal-free systems only the primary water-derived radicals, H,e/sub aq/, and OH, contribute toward enzyme inactivation, while the secondary species O/sub 2/ and CO/sub 2/ do not. The effect of copper(II) ions on the radiation-induced damage depended on which of the active species was predominant. With OH radicals, no effect of copper was detected. The damage originating from e/sub aq/ and H radicals decreased with the addition of copper, presumably due to their trapping by the copper(II) ions. In contrast, with O/sub 2/ radicals predominant in the system, copper dramatically enhanced the damage. This copper-induced sensitization was further increased in the presence of H/sub 2/O/sub 2/ and the dose modifying factor of copper exceeded 100, i.e. enchancement of the damage by two orders of magnitude, as compared with an oxygen enhancement ratiomore » of 2-3 generally found for molecular oxygen. This copper effect could be completely eliminated by EDTA. The present results suggest that the presence of both transition metal ions and H/sub 2/O/sub 2/ and the binding of the metal ions to the target bimolecules are required for the manifestation.« less"

This rate is comparable to that observed with the most effective neutrophil-stimulating agents previously reported. Other cis-unsaturated fatty acids are also capable of eliciting this response, the order of effectiveness being: arachidonate greater than gamma-linolenate greater than linoleate greater than oleate. Linolelaidate, myristate, and palmitate are ineffective. These data are discussed in relation to recent reports concerning the oxidation of arachidonic acid by human neutrophils and by a cell-free system that generates superoxide and hydrogen peroxide."

https://openalex.org/W1480933474,"The requirements for cholera toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of the purified regulatory component of adenylate cyclase are described. In addition to the toxin, this reaction is dependent on or is facilitated by NAD, GTP, phospholipid, and a factor found associated with plasma membranes from several sources. Factor activity is heat-labile and protease-sensitive but is unaffected by treatment with N-ethylmaleimide. Gel filtration indicates that the factor behaves as a monodisperse species with a Stokes radius of 3.2 nm. The factor thus appears to be a protein that is distinct from any of the known components of adenylate cyclase. Factor activity was also detected in the cytoplasm of S49 cells. The cytoplasmic factor was smaller (Stokes radius = 2.0 nm) than the membrane-derived factor, and it was inactivated in the presence of sodium cholate. The initial rate of activation of the regulatory component of adenylate cyclase by toxin was found to be linearly related to the amount of factor present in the reaction. This has allowed the quantitation and partial purification (33-fold from detergent extracts) of the factor from turkey erythrocyte membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1551266724,"The regulatory component (G/F) of adenylate cyclase has been purified from turkey erythrocyte plasma membranes by adaptation of procedures developed for purification of the rabbit liver protein. The major modifications entail inclusion of high concentrations of NaCl to facilitate extraction and reconstitution of the protein. A typical preparation yields 200 micrograms of protein with a reconstitutive specific activity of 3-4 mumol . min-1 mg-1. Turkey erythrocyte G/F contains two putative subunits of 35,000 and 45,000 daltons. The 52,000-dalton polypeptide that appears to be a component of rabbit liver G/F is lacking. In solution, G/F behaves as a particle with Mr = 81,000. This value is reduced to 50,000 in the presence of activating ligands, suggesting dissociation of subunits. Activation of G/F by guanine nucleotide analogs is markedly accelerated in the presence of high concentrations of Mg2+. Reconstitutive and physical properties of the protein are also affected by fluoride. Cyc- S49 lymphoma membranes reconstituted with turkey erythrocyte G/F acquire properties that are characteristic of the turkey adenylate cyclase system; at least certain differing characteristics of adenylate cyclase systems are thus dictated by the nature of their G/F."
https://openalex.org/W195488899,"Addition of the a-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine rapidly terminates a-adrenergic stimulation of phosphorylase in isolated hepatocytes and enhances reaccumulation of Ca2+. a-Adrenergic receptors and effects in hepatocytes are not desensitized after phenylephrine treatment since a second addition of the agonist at 30 min, when phosphorylase activity and Ca2+ content have returned to basal levels, activates phosphorylase and elicits Ca2+ efflux to the same extent as seen after the first addition. Phosphorylase activation in hepatocytes by maximally effective doses of epinephrine and vasopressin is consistently observed at 5 s, with maximum effects at 20 s. Efflux of Ca2+ from perfused livers or of 45Ca2+ from hepatocytes is also very rapidly increased by aadrenergic stimulation. Agents which affect mitochondrial function such as 2,4-dinitrophenol, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, valinomycin, and oligomycin also activate phosphorylase and elicit Ca2+ efflux in hepatocytes at rates imilar to those seen with a-agonists and vasopressin. When a-agonists are combined with vasopressin or mitochondrial inhibitors at maximally effective concentrations, their effects on Ca2+ efflux or phosphorylase are nonadditive implying common mechanisms. Rapid chelation of extracellular Ca2+ with ethylene glycol bis (P-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N’,I?”tetraacetic acid to lower the concentration of free ca2+ to 0.1 pM does not influence the ability (rate and magnitude) of a-agonists, vasopressin, A23187, and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation to stimulate Ca2+ efflux and phosphorylase activation in hepatocytes. However, when cells are depleted of Ca2+ by prolonged ethylene glycol bis(P-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,iV’,N”tetraacetic acid treatment, the actions of vasopressin and uncouplers are severely impaired. It is concluded from these studies that the activation of hepatic phosphorylase by a-adrenergic agonists, vasopressin, and mitochondrial inhibitors does not involve an influx of external Ca2+ and that the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ pools such as mitochondria and perhaps endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane, is sufficiently rapid to account for the metabolic"
https://openalex.org/W185329323,"The protein encoded by the red beta gene of bacteriophage lambda was found to promote reannealing of complementary single strands of DNA. Reannealing activity was optimal at pH 6.0 and required a divalent cation. A threshold temperature of at least 15 degrees C was necessary in order to detect activity. The reaction was linear with time for about 20 min, but the extent of reaction was dependent upon the amount of beta protein added. Reannealing of complementary single strands was confirmed by measuring increased lability of DNA to lambda exonuclease. When protein preparations from red- lysogens were tested for ability to promote reannealing, high activity was observed in a mutant altered in the gene for exonuclease, but there was low activity in a mutant altered in the gene for beta protein."

https://openalex.org/W1494515526,"The calorigenic action of norepinephrine in isolated brown adipocytes was selectively mimicked by theophylline, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, and the principal fatty acids known to be present in the acyl moieties of brown adipose tissue triglycerides (palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acids). The stimulatory effects of fatty acids were entirely reversible, occurred at physiological concentrations, and were critically dependent upon the molar ratio of extracellular fatty acids to albumin. The calorigenic potency of fatty acids increased with their chain length. The apparent synchrony between the switching on and off of lipolysis and respiration by norepinephrine and propranolol indicated that the two phenomena are functionally inter-related and that they are both mediated by beta-adrenoreceptors. Respiratory stimulation by palmitic acid was accompanied by an inhibition of glycerol release suggesting that fatty acids retroinhibit lipolysis while simultaneously activating respiration. Studies with 2-tetradecylglycidic acid, oligomycin, and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation support the view that fatty acids exert their calorigenic effects by increasing mitochondrial proton permeability and by simultaneously serving as substrates for beta-oxidation via carnitine-dependent pathways. Since fatty acids mimicked the calorigenic action of norepinephrine even when beta-adrenoreceptors were blocked by propranolol, it is concluded that cyclic AMP controls respiration indirectly, most probably by modulating lipolysis. It is suggested that endogenous long chain fatty acids released in consequence of cyclic AMP activation of lipolysis play a fundamental role in the control of brown adipose tissue metabolism by self-regulating lipolysis and by serving as physiological modulators of mitochondrial oxygen consumption."
https://openalex.org/W1510656481,"Alkylation interference and protection methods (Siebenlist, U., and Gilbert, W., (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 77, 122-126) have been utilized to deduce potential DNA contacts involved in specific complex formation between Eco RI endonuclease and its recognition sequence. The endonuclease protected the N7 position (major groove) of the dG and the N3 position (minor groove) of both dA residues within the Eco RI sequence against alkylation by dimethylsulfate, d(GpApApTpTpC), suggesting the presence of poly-peptide in both grooves in the vicinity of affected nitrogens. Results of methylation interference analysis suggest that the N7 of the Eco RI site dG and the N3 of the central dA, d(GpApApTpTpC), are utilized as contacts by the enzyme. The failure to observe interference upon methylation of the 5‘-penultimate dA within the sequence implies that the endonuclease does not bond to the N3 of this residue, despite the fact that it is protected against alkylation by the protein. Ethylation interference patterns suggest four major phosphate contacts between endonuclease and each DNA strand. Two of these phosphates are 5‘-external to the Eco RI sequence, d(pNpGpApApTpTpC), suggesting involvement of outside phosphates in electrostatic interactions. Moreover, alkylation protection and interference effects on the two DNA strands display perfect 2-fold symmetry. Thus, the endonuclease interacts with a minimum of 10 nucleotide pairs to yield a DNA-protein complex characterized by elements of symmetry. In contrast, specific alkylation effects were not observed in comparable experiments with the endonuclease and a DNA which had been previously methylated by the Eco RI modification enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2012365278,"Cells of the homogeneous hybrid line neuroblastoma × glioma (NG108-15) have many neuronal properties. Immunocytochemical tests show that they contain both immunoreactive renin and angiotensin; direct radioimmunoassays show that they are positive for renin, angiotensin I, and angiotensin II; enzymatic assays show that they contain angiotensinogen and converting enzyme as well. The renin appears to be present in an enzymatically inactive form that can be activated by trypsin and then blocked by antiserum to purified mouse submaxillary renin. Renin concentration and activity are increased by enhancing cellular differentiation with dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate or by serum withdrawal. These findings demonstrate a complete renin-angiotensin system within these neuron-like cells, and suggest that activation of intracellular renin could generate angiotensin II."
https://openalex.org/W1517580958,"Protocatechuate dioxygenase has been isolated from Pseudomonas putida. This new species of protocatechuate dioxygenase has been characterized and compared with the enzyme from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The enzyme reported here has visible absorption, circular dichroism, electron paramagnetic resonance, and Raman spectroscopic properties virtually identical to those for protocatechuate dioxygenase from P. aeruginosa. However, the molecular weight and iron:subunit stoichiometry differ. Protocatechuate dioxygenase from P. putida has a molecular weight of 200,000 and contains 4 alpha subunits of 23,000 daltons, 4 beta subunits of 26,500 daltons, and 4 ferric irons suggesting that the enzyme is a tetramer of (alpha beta Fe+3) catalytic units. Protocatechuate dioxygenase from P. aeruginosa has been reported to have a Mr = 700,000, consisting of 16 alpha subunits of 22,500 daltons, 16 beta subunits of 25,000 daltons, and 8 ferric irons (Yoshida, R., Hori, K., Fujiwara, M., Saeki, Y., Kagamiyama, H., and Nozaki, W. (1976) Biochemistry 15, 4048-4053). This enzyme is thought to be an octamer of (alpha 2 beta 2 Fe+3) catalytic units, although reconstitution with extra iron will somewhat increase its activity. Using stopped flow techniques, we have shown that essentially all of the iron in the P. putida enzyme is catalytically active. This suggests that the minimal catalytic unit of all non-heme iron intradiol dioxygenases is an (alpha beta Fe+3) structure."
https://openalex.org/W1576094751,"Evidence is presented for the location at the surface of HeLa cells of a protein kinase capable of phosphorylating surface as well as extracellular (foreign) proteins. The reaction products have been found to be proteins containing phosphoryl groups as monoesters of seryl and threonyl residues (but not of tyrosine). The enzyme is of the cyclic AMP-independent type, since neither cyclic AMP nor the heat- and acid-stable inhibitor protein (specific for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases) influenced its activity. Further, co-substrate ATP could in part be substituted by GTP, and the spectrum of proteins phosphorylated by the ecto-enzyme differed from that phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. Evidence for the ecto-enzymic nature of this protein kinase includes (a) utilization of co-substrate and location of products at the surface of cells carefully controlled as being in an intact state and (b) phosphorylation of exogenous protein (phosvitin; specific serum proteins) by intact cells. Conclusive proof was gained by qualitative and quantitative comparative studies of phosphorylation in cultures with varying degrees of damaged cells either as a whole or after separation into groups of intact and damaged cells by electronic cell sorting. The results of experiments with cell sonicates excluded the possibility that either enzyme or substrates released from damaged cells were simply adsorbing to the cell surface."

Most neurons that were inhibited by the mu agonists were also inhibited by the delta agonist, but the two receptors could be distinguished by the higher concentration of naloxone required to antagonize the delta agonist. The results indicate that enteric neurons bear both mu and delta receptors and that cell firing is inhibited if either receptor type is activated."
https://openalex.org/W93269911,"Cultured Leydig cells were employed for in vitro studies on gonadotropin-induced regulation of luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors and desensitization of steroidogenic responses, and to analyze the role of estradiol in the development of enzymatic lesions that impair the conversion of progesterone to androgen. After 24 h in culture, adult rat Leydig cells retained 60% of their LH receptors and showed no change in maximal testosterone response to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Such acutely cultured cells were incubated for 24 h with human chorionic gonadotropin or ovine LH (oLH), and then analyzed for LH binding sites and steroidogenic responses. LH receptors were increased by 1 ng of hCG or oLH to 153% and 131% of control, and were reduced at higher doses to 57% and 2% (by 10 and 100 ng of hCG) or to 70% and 44% (by 100 and 1000 ng of oLH). No change in LH receptors was seen in cells stimulated with dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The “Iate” enzyme lesion in 17a-hydroxylase and 17,220-desmolase activities was manifested at 1 to 10 ng of hCG and 10 to 1000 ng of oLH by increases in progesterone and 17u-hydroxyprogesterone, and was more marked after hCG treatment. The highest hCG dose (100 ng) also caused an “early” steroidogenic lesion prior to pregnenolone, previously observed in vivo and found to be unrelated to estrogen. This lesion was also observed after treatment of cultured cells with 0.5 to 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP. The late steroidogenic lesion in cultured cells was prevented by Tamoxifen, added 20 min before hCG and present throughout the incubation. Incubation with 1 to 100 ng of estradiol for 24 h caused a dose-dependent decrease in testosterone production, with concomitant accumulation of 17a-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone. These estrogen-induced changes, like those produced by chorionic gonadotropin, were prevented by addition of Tamoxifen. Exposure of Leydig cells to estradiol for 6 to 12 h was required to cause the steroidogenic lesions. The estrogen-dependent enzymatic defect was preceded by synthesis of a specific protein of M, 27,000, which was induced by estradiol or hCG, and was inhibited by Tamoxifen. These studies have defined an in vitro system suitable for the investigation of gonadotropin-dependent regulatory mechanisms.

Modulation of the late steroidogenic enzymes by endogenous estradiol contributes to the regulation of androgen production, and could be exerted through synthesis of estrogen-dependent proteins of the Leydig cell."
https://openalex.org/W1583533334,"A general mechanism for the assembly of procollagens is proposed from a biosynthetic study of procollagen III. This was shown to proceed by a stepwise process punctuated by disulfide bond formation and an assembly intermediate was recovered. The biosynthesis of type III procollagen in excised chick embryo blood vessels was studied by radioactive labeling for 30 min. Velocity sedimentation under denaturing conditions and purified antibodies specific against bovine amino propeptide III were used to identify and characterize monomeric pro alpha 1 III chains and a type III procollagen intermediate which is interchain disulfide-linked only at the carboxyl end but not at the amino end. The monomeric chains presumably have intrachain disulfide bonds within the propeptides. The monomeric pro alpha 1 III chains were also found when alpha, alpha'-dipyridyl was present during incubation. Pulse-chase experiments show that the monomeric chains and the intermediate are biosynthetic precursors of type III procollagen. Furthermore, it is shown that monomeric pro alpha 1 chains are not triple helical when extracted under nondenaturing conditions. The results indicate that the assembly of pro alpha 1 III chains into type III procollagen starts with the association of the folded carboxyl propeptides and is followed by formation of disulfide bonds between carboxyl propeptides, folding of the triple helix, and formation of disulfide bonds between amino propeptides. All procollagens may follow a similar assembly sequence."

This value decreases to 0.04% within 3 h after the addition of insulin. Maximal effects are produced by 10(-10) M insulin, and half-maximal deinduction of both the relative rate of synthesis of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase and mRNA coding for P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase activity occurs at approximately 2 X 10(-12) M insulin. Porcine proinsulin is 4% as potent as porcine insulin since half-maximal deinduction of mRNA coding for P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase occurs at 5 X 10(-11) M. The concentration of proinsulin required to inhibit 125I-insulin binding by 50% is 2 X 10(-7) M, as compared to 6 X 10(-9) M for insulin; thus, the decreased sensitivity of this deinduction to proinsulin parallels the decreased binding affinity H4IIEC3 cells have for proinsulin as compared to insulin. These data indicate that insulin regulates P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis through a receptor-mediated process, that the effect occurs when less than 2% of the insulin receptors are occupied, and that this effect is exerted prior to the level of mRNA translation."

https://openalex.org/W1500324843,"Ribonucleotide reductase induced by bacteriophage T4 in Escherichia coli contains an organic free radical necessary for enzymatic activity. Its EPR spectrum at 77K is similar to but not identical with that of the corresponding radical in the enzyme from uninfected E. coli studied previously. Isotope substitutions now show that the radical in the T4-induced enzyme also is localized to a tyrosine residue with its spin density delocalized over the aromatic ring of tyrosine. The difference between the radicals of the T4-induced and the E. coli ribonucleotide reductases, as reflected in the hyperfine patterns of their EPR spectra, is suggested to be due to slightly different radical geometries, resulting from a twist of about 10 degrees around the bond between the aromatic ring and the methylene group in the tyrosine radical. Hydroxyurea destroys the free radicals of both ribonucleotide reductases and also their catalytic activities. Both enzymes are considerably more sensitive to hydroxyurea during catalysis than in the noncatalytic state. However, when compared to the bacterial ribonucleotide reductase, the T4-induced enzyme shows an overall approximately 10 times higher sensitivity to hydroxyurea, judging from the drug concentrations needed to destroy the radicals and inhibit the activities. This result may reflect a difference in accessibility for the drug to the active sites of the enzymes."

Sonication at 65 degrees C was required for maximal activity with dipalmitoylglycerol but not for dioleoylglycerol. Highest activity was obtained when diacylglycerol was sonicated with phosphatidylglycerol and Tween 20 although phosphatidylglycerol also increased the activity when added separately. The presence of phosphatidylglycerol was critical particularly with dipalmitoylglycerol as substrate.

https://openalex.org/W1915504618,In this study we examine the effects of intravenous ethyl oleate emulsions on the metabolism of native and cyclohexanedione-modified human low density lipoprotein in rabbits. Treatment produced a highly significant fall in receptor-independent catabolism as measured by the fractional clearance rate of cyclohexanedione-modified low density lipoprotein. Receptor-dependent catabolism (the difference between the fractional clearance rates of native and cyclohexanedione-modified low density lipoprotein) was variably affected with some animals showing a decrease in receptor activity. These data suggest that the reticuloendothelial system makes a substantial contribution to receptor-independent low density lipoprotein catabolism in the rabbit.

The promoter region was identified by S1 nuclease mapping of a portion of the HindIIIB fragment of the rRNA gene, using the 35 S rRNA primary transcript as a probe. The nucleotide sequence of the initiation site and the 5'-flanking region reveals three sets of highly conserved repeat sequences. A model of the promoter region is presented in which the rDNA is wrapped around a series of histone octamers. In this model the families of repeat sequences are brought in close proximity and suggest several possible mechanisms for the regulation of rRNA synthesis in T. pyriformis."
https://openalex.org/W1564980695,"The catalytic role of the metal ion in bovine carboxypeptidase A (peptidyl-L-amino acid hydrolase; EC 3.4.12.2) is investigated by application of cryoenzymologic and electron paramagnetic resonance methods with use of the Co2+-reconstituted enzyme. Incorporation of 17O into oxygen-donor ligands induces a substantial change in the spin-lattice relaxation probability of the paramagnetic ion. While a change in spin-lattice relaxation is observed for the free Co2+-enzyme in 17O-enriched water, no change is observed for the enzyme complexed to glycyl-L-tyrosine. These results are consistent with x-ray crystallographic studies showing that the metal-bound water molecule in the active site is displaced upon binding of the peptide inhibitor. A change in spin-lattice relaxation of the Co2+ ion in the mixed anhydride, acyl-enzyme intermediate formed with the specific ester substrate O-(trans-p-chlorocinnamoyl)-L-beta-phenyllactate is observed when 17O is enriched either into water or into the carbonyl oxygen position of the scissile bond of the substrate. Since the protein supplies three amino acid side chains as ligands to the metal ion, these results indicate that the metal ion is altered from a tetra-coordinate species in the free enzyme to a penta-coordinate species in the acyl-enzyme reaction intermediate. In addition, the results provide structural support for our assignment of ionization of a metal-bound water molecule in rate-limiting deacylation (Makinen, M. W., Kuo, L. C., Dymowski, J. J., and Jaffer, S. (1979) J. Biol.

Since choleragen might also activate adenylate cyclase by a similar mechanism, the effect of toxin treatment on the release of guanyl nucleotides from turkey erythrocyte membranes was examined. In the presence of NAD, choleragen was found to stimulate release of guanyl nucleotides from membranes which had been preloaded with radiolabeled GTP. No stimulation of release was observed with cAMP or when NAD was replaced by NADP, which does not serve as a substrate for choleragen-catalyzed ADP ribosylation. While either isoproterenol or choleragen can stimulate release of guanyl nucleotides from the membranes, the amount of guanyl nucleotide released in the presence of both isoproterenol and choleragen was no greater than that released by isoproterenol alone. Furthermore, when membranes were first treated with choleragen and NAD, the subsequent release of guanyl nucleotides induced by isoproterenol was reduced to approximately 15% of that observed with membranes not treated with the toxin. Therefore, choleragen may enhance release of guanine nucleotides from sites on the membranes that are also affected by beta-adrenergic agonists, sites which are thought to correspond to G/F. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that choleragen may stimulate adenylate cyclase, in part, by enhancing release of guanyl nucleotides, a mechanism similar to that of beta-adrenergic agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1571912469,"Chlorella nitrate reductase catalyzes the reduction of nitrate to nitrite by NADH. Initial velocity studies showed that the kinetic mechanism is sequential, indicating that both substrates must bind to the enzyme before any products are released. Product inhibition with NAD and nitrite showed that competitive inhibition was observed when the inhibitor was similar to the varied substrate, while noncompetitive inhibition was observed when the inhibitor was dissimilar to the varied substrate. Likewise, dead-end inhibition with adenosine 5'-diphosphoribose and thiocyanate showed competitive inhibition when the inhibitor was similar to the varied substrate and noncompetitive inhibition when the inhibitor was dissimilar to the varied substrate. These results indicate that Chlorella nitrate reductase follows a random bi bi kinetic mechanism. Phosphate was found to stimulate NADH:nitrate reductase activity and 2-fold. The NADH:cytochrome c reductase activity associated with nitrate reductase was not affected by phosphate suggesting the effect of phosphate is on the nitrate-reducing moiety of the enzyme. Phosphate increases Vmax but has no effect on the apparent Km for nitrate."
https://openalex.org/W2062877273,"A biologically active rhodamine conjugate of thyrotropin binds at 4 degrees C to diffusely distributed membrane thyrotropin receptors which patch and become endocytosed into thyroid cells in a temperature-sensitive process. When the cells are first incubated with 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate at 37 degrees C, the conjugate also binds to clustered receptors at 4 degrees C. Furthermore, 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine monophosphate reduces the amount of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) induced by thyrotropin. Hence, increased intracellular cyclic AMP induces receptor patching and reduces the concentration of cyclic AMP normally induced by thyrotropin. This suggests that cyclic AMP acts both as the second messenger of thyrotropin and also as the regulator of the level of thyrotropin receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1515500852,"Abstract A stable DNA-protein complex was released from rat liver mitochondria by sodium dodecyl sulfate-lysis and isolated by sedimentation velocity in sucrose density gradients. The mtDNA-protein complex was washed with 0.5 M NaCl and any unbound contaminants were removed by hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The only detectable polypeptide in the complex was a single low molecular weight species (Mr = 16,000) having a slightly basic isoelectric point of 7.6-7.8. Complete digestion of the mtDNA-protein complex with restriction endonuclease HindIII revealed in agarose gels an extra band consisting of a subset of the largest fragment population. The fragments in this subset were shown to contain the replicative intermediates which were retarded in electrophoretic migration due to the parental strand separation in the region of the replication loops. No loss of nascent strands due to branch migration of the parental strands was observed upon HindIII cleavage of the covalently closed circular DNA in the mtDNA-protein complex. However, HindIII digestion of completely deproteinized mtDNA resulted in quantitative loss of nascent strands from replicating molecules. These results are interpreted as evidence that the single low molecular weight polypeptide present in the complex plays a major role in maintaining the integrity of replication loops during parental strand scission."
https://openalex.org/W1533788252,"Abstract The nucleotide sequence of the yeast iso-1-cytochrome c (CYC1) mRNA is presented. The mRNA was enriched by hybridization to cloned CYC1 DNA attached to a solid matrix: either nitrocellulose filters or diazobenzyloxymethyl cellulose powder. The sequence of the 5'-end of the mRNA was determined by the extension of a CYC1-specific dodecanucleotide primer; the sequence of the 3'-end was determined using a decanucleotide d(pT8-G-A) primer. The CYC1 mRNA begins 61 nucleotides 5' to the AUG initiation codon, extends through the coding sequence to 172 to 175 nucleotides 3' to the UAA termination codon, followed by the poly(A) tail. There are no intervening sequences. Some of the sequences that the CYC1 mRNA shares in common with other eukaryotic mRNAs are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1577915486,"Two polypeptides associated with the envelope of vesicular stomatitis virus are obtained by exhaustive proteolytic digestion of the virion. Analysis of the tryptic peptides and determination of the partial amino acid sequence show that the larger membrane-anchoring peptide is derived from the hydrophobic COOH terminus of the viral transmembrane glycoprotein G. The smaller peptide is, however, derived from the nonglycosylated matrix protein M. Analysis of the membrane-anchoring peptide fragments obtained from virus labeled with [3H]palmitic acid shows that the larger peptide fragment contained all the fatty acid present in G, suggesting that the fatty acids in conjunction with the hydrophobic domain may be involved in the binding of G protein to the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1596851408,"Abstract We have purified a small, basic protein with high affinity and selectivity for biogenic amine receptors to apparent homogeneity from the venom of Russell's viper (Vipera russelli). This protein, which we designate has Mr = 13,000, and appears to exist in solution as a single polypeptide chain. It may contain 2 atypical amino acids. Vipoxin inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the binding of 3H-ligands to biogenic amine receptors, with apparent Ki values of 3 nM at alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, 5 nM at alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, 15 nM at dopamine receptors, and 32 nM at serotonin receptors. At concentrations up to 1 microM, vipoxin is inactive at beta-adrenergic, histamine, nicotinic cholinergic, muscarinic cholinergic, adenosine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, benzodiazepine, or opiate receptor binding sites. The effect of vipoxin is essentially irreversible over 20 h at alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and serotonin receptors and is only slightly reversible at dopamine receptors. Norepinephrine protects alpha-adrenergic receptors from inhibition by vipoxin, while dopamine does not. Vipoxin has no protease activity but does have phospholipase A2 activity, which cannot account for its action on receptors, since receptor binding is assayed in the presence of 1 mM CoSO4 which completely and selectively inhibits the phospholipase activity. Other phospholipases A2 in the same venom lack vipoxin's action on receptors. In physiologic experiments, vipoxin behaves as an agonist at alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the rat vas deferens and is over an order of magnitude more potent than norepinephrine itself. At alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, it is neither a simple agonist nor an antagonist, but selectively potentiates norepinephrine. Vipoxin may be a useful tool for biogenic amine receptor characterization."

https://openalex.org/W1531053714,"Differential scanning calorimetry has been used in combination with gel analysis and electron microscopy to identify and study the structural domains of the membrane-enclosed vesicular stomatitis virus and its isolated internal components. Three major endothermic transitions centered at approximately 52, 76, and 80 degrees C and at least two minor transitions are observed at pH 7.0 for the intact virion. Thermal gel analysis suggests the possibility that specific proteins of vesicular stomatitis virus are involved in two or more of the calorimetric transitions. The effect of heating to defined temperatures on the morphology of the virion was studied by negative stain electron microscopy. The results of these thermal EM studies show discrete irreversible morphological changes in the virion which seem to coincide with the three major calorimetric transitions."
https://openalex.org/W1568721215,"Amidination of the available lysine residues of the complex between RNase A and human placental RNase inhibitor has been performed with methyl acetimidate; the conditions of the derivatization preserve the complex functionally intact. Resistance of epsilon-acetimidyllysine residues to hydrolysis by trypsin allowed, after peptide mapping, the identification of lysine residues 7, 31, 41, 61, and 91 as those which were fully protected by the inhibitor from amidination. Lysine residue 37 was partially protected from amidination. In the presence of poly(A), lysine residues 41 and 61 of RNase A were fully protected from amidination, while lysine residues 7, 31, 37, 91, and 104 were only partially protected; the enzyme retained full activity. The results permit identification of lysine residues located in the binding domain of RNase A for the inhibitor. This region is not identical with, but does overlap, the binding domain for poly(A)."

https://openalex.org/W2141695195,"We have developed a cell-free system from Aedes albopictus (mosquito) cells which is able to carry out endogenous protein synthesis and is stable to freezing and thawing. Successful preparation of extracts was found to depend on the presence of purified placental RNase inhibitor during cell breakage. Micrococcal nuclease-treated extracts translated exogenously added Sindbis 26S or vesicular stomatitis virus mRNA with a high degree of fidelity, demonstrating that initiation of protein synthesis had occurred. Evidence is presented showing that when cell fractions containing intracellular membranes were used to translate vesicular stomatitis virus mRNA, the G protein was glycosylated and inserted into microsomal vesicles. Additional studies indicate that initiation of protein synthesis in this system is dependent on a capped and methylated 5'-terminal structure in the mRNA."
