https://openalex.org/W3215049942,"Abstract T cell immunity is central for the control of viral infections. CoVac-1 is a peptide-based vaccine candidate, composed of SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes derived from various viral proteins 1,2 , combined with the Toll-like receptor 1/2 agonist XS15 emulsified in Montanide ISA51 VG, aiming to induce profound SARS-CoV-2 T cell immunity to combat COVID-19. Here we conducted a phase I open-label trial, recruiting 36 participants aged 18–80 years, who received a single subcutaneous CoVac-1 vaccination. The primary end point was safety analysed until day 56. Immunogenicity in terms of CoVac-1-induced T cell response was analysed as the main secondary end point until day 28 and in the follow-up until month 3. No serious adverse events and no grade 4 adverse events were observed. Expected local granuloma formation was observed in all study participants, whereas systemic reactogenicity was absent or mild. SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses targeting multiple vaccine peptides were induced in all study participants, mediated by multifunctional T helper 1 CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. CoVac-1-induced IFNγ T cell responses persisted in the follow-up analyses and surpassed those detected after SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as after vaccination with approved vaccines. Furthermore, vaccine-induced T cell responses were unaffected by current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. Together, CoVac-1 showed a favourable safety profile and induced broad, potent and variant of concern-independent T cell responses, supporting the presently ongoing evaluation in a phase II trial for patients with B cell or antibody deficiency."

https://openalex.org/W3208379306,"The lncRNA Xist forms ∼50 diffraction-limited foci to transcriptionally silence one X chromosome. How this small number of RNA foci and interacting proteins regulate a much larger number of X-linked genes is unknown. We show that Xist foci are locally confined, contain ∼2 RNA molecules, and nucleate supramolecular complexes (SMACs) that include many copies of the critical silencing protein SPEN. Aggregation and exchange of SMAC proteins generate local protein gradients that regulate broad, proximal chromatin regions. Partitioning of numerous SPEN molecules into SMACs is mediated by their intrinsically disordered regions and essential for transcriptional repression. Polycomb deposition via SMACs induces chromatin compaction and the increase in SMACs density around genes, which propagates silencing across the X chromosome. Our findings introduce a mechanism for functional nuclear compartmentalization whereby crowding of transcriptional and architectural regulators enables the silencing of many target genes by few RNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W3217227638,"The mortality rates of COVID-19 vary widely across countries, but the underlying mechanisms remain unelucidated. We aimed at the elucidation of relationship between gut microbiota and the mortality rates of COVID-19 across countries. Raw sequencing data of 16S rRNA V3-V5 regions of gut microbiota in 953 healthy subjects in ten countries were obtained from the public database. We made a generalized linear model (GLM) to predict the COVID-19 mortality rates using gut microbiota. GLM revealed that low genus Collinsella predicted high COVID-19 mortality rates with a markedly low p -value. Unsupervised clustering of gut microbiota in 953 subjects yielded five enterotypes. The mortality rates were increased from enterotypes 1 to 5, whereas the abundances of Collinsella were decreased from enterotypes 1 to 5 except for enterotype 2. Collinsella produces ursodeoxycholate. Ursodeoxycholate was previously reported to inhibit binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; suppress pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6; have antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects; and increase alveolar fluid clearance in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Ursodeoxycholate produced by Collinsella may prevent COVID-19 infection and ameliorate acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 by suppressing cytokine storm syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W3164734471,"An upsurge in dream and nightmare frequency has been noted since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and research shows increases in levels of stress, depression and anxiety during this time. Growing evidence suggests that dream content has a bi-directional relationship with psychopathology, and that dreams react to new, personally significant and emotional experiences. The first lockdown experience was an acute event, characterized by a combination of several unprecedent factors (new pandemic, threat of disease, global uncertainty, the experience of social isolation and exposure to stressful information) that resulted in a large-scale disruption of life routines. This study aimed at investigating changes in dream, bad dream and nightmare recall; most prevalent dream themes; and the relationship between dreams, bad dreams, nightmares and symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety during the first COVID-19 lockdown (April-May 2020) through a national online survey.968 participants completed an online survey. Dream themes were measured using the Typical Dreams Questionnaire; stress levels were measured by the Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale; symptoms of anxiety were assessed by Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale; and symptoms of depression were assessed using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology.34% (328) of participants reported increased dream recall during the lockdown. The most common dream themes were centered around the topics of 1) inefficacy (e.g., trying again and again, arriving late), 2) human threat (e.g., being chased, attacked); 3) death; and 4) pandemic imagery (e.g., being separated from loved ones, being sick). Dream, bad dream and nightmare frequency was highest in individuals with moderate to severe stress levels. Frequency of bad dreams, nightmares, and dreams about the pandemic, inefficacy, and death were associated with higher levels of stress, as well as with greater symptoms of depression and anxiety.Results support theories of dream formation, environmental susceptibility and stress reactivity. Dream content during the lockdown broadly reflected existential concerns and was associated with increased symptoms of mental health indices."
https://openalex.org/W3217352318,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a significant public health issue. Identifying patients with simple steatosis from those with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is crucial since NASH is correlated with increased morbidity and mortality. Serum-based markers, including adipokines and cytokines, are important in the pathogenesis and progression of NAFLD. Here we assessed the usefulness of such markers in patients with NAFLD.This prospective, cross-sectional study included 105 adult patients with varying severity of NAFLD. Twelve serum-based markers were measured by 3 biochip platforms and 2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. We also developed a NAFLD individual fibrosis index (NIFI) using the serum-based markers mostly correlated with fibrosis severity.Sixty-one out of 105 patients were male (58.1%) with mean age was 53.5 years. Higher Interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased (p = 0.0321) and lower Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) serum levels (p = 0.0031) were associated with higher fibrosis as measured by Fibroscan® in multivariable regression analysis. Using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for the NIFI, area under the curve for predicting Fibroscan values ≥ 7.2 kPa was 0.77 (95%CI: 0.67, 0.88, p<0.001), with sensitivity of 89.3%, specificity of 57.9% and a positive likelihood ratio of 2.8.Increasing fibrosis severity in NAFLD is associated with differential expression of IL-6 and MMP-9. NIFI could be valuable for the prediction of advanced NAFLD fibrosis and potentially help avoid unnecessary interventions such as liver biopsy in low-risk patients."
https://openalex.org/W3215268853,"Psychological and physical well-being of health personnel has been significantly affected by COVID-19. Work overload and continuous exposure to positive COVID-19 cases have caused them fatigue, stress, anxiety, insomnia and other detriments. This research aims: 1) to analyze whether the use of cognitive reevaluation and emotional suppression strategies decreases and increases, respectively, stress levels of health personnel; 2) to quantify the impact of contact with patients with COVID-19 on stress levels of medical staff.Emotion regulation strategies (cognitive reevaluation and emotional expression) and stress levels were evaluated in 155 Dominican physicians who were treating people infected with COVID-19 at the moment of the study (67.9% women and 32.1% men; mean age = 34.89; SD = 9.26). In addition, a questionnaire created by the researchers quantified the impact that contact with those infected had on their stress levels.Contact with patients with COVID-19 predicts increased use of emotion suppression strategies, although is not associated with the use of cognitive reevaluation. These findings lead to an even greater increase in stress on health care providers.Contextual contingencies demand immediate responses and may not allow health personnel to use cognitive re-evaluation strategies, leaning more towards emotion suppression. However, findings regarding high levels of stress require the implementation of intervention programs focused on the promotion of more functional emotion regulation strategies. Such programs may reduce current stress and prevent post-traumatic symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W3216303817,"Background Food production accounts for 30% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Less environmentally sustainable diets are also often more processed, energy-dense and nutrient-poor. To date, the environmental impact of diets have mostly been based on a limited number of broad food groups. Objectives We link GHG emissions to over 3000 foods, assessing associations between individuals’ GHG emissions, their nutrient requirements and their demographic characteristics. We also identify additional information required in dietary assessment to generate more accurate environmental impact data for individual-level diets. Methods GHG emissions of individual foods, including process stages prior to retail, were added to the UK Composition Of Foods Integrated Dataset (COFID) composition tables and linked to automated online dietary assessment for 212 adults over three 24-hour periods. Variations in GHG emissions were explored by dietary pattern, demographic characteristics and World Health Organization Recommended Nutrient Intakes (RNIs). Results GHG emissions estimates were linked to 98% (n = 3233) of food items. Meat explained 32% of diet-related GHG emissions; 15% from drinks; 14% from dairy; and 8% from cakes, biscuits and confectionery. Non-vegetarian diets had GHG emissions 59% (95% CI 18%, 115%) higher than vegetarian. Men had 41% (20%, 64%) higher GHG emissions than women. Individuals meeting RNIs for saturated fats, carbohydrates and sodium had lower GHG emissions compared to those exceeding the RNI. Discussion Policies encouraging sustainable diets should focus on plant-based diets. Substituting tea, coffee and alcohol with more sustainable alternatives, whilst reducing less nutritious sweet snacks, presents further opportunities. Healthier diets had lower GHG emissions, demonstrating consistency between planetary and personal health. Further detail could be gained from incorporating brand, production methods, post-retail emissions, country of origin, and additional environmental impact indicators."
https://openalex.org/W3217042959,"Healthcare workers are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In low- and middle- income countries, they may be particularly impacted by underfunded health systems, lack of personal protective equipment, challenging working conditions and barriers in accessing personal healthcare.In this cross-sectional study, occupational health screening was implemented at the largest public sector medical centre in Harare, Zimbabwe, during the ""first wave"" of the country's COVID-19 epidemic. Clients were voluntarily screened for symptoms of COVID-19, and if present, offered a SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection assay. In addition, measurement of height, weight, blood pressure and HbA1c, HIV and TB testing, and mental health screening using the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ-14) were offered. An interviewer-administered questionnaire ascertained client knowledge and experiences related to COVID-19.Between 27th July and 30th October 2020, 951 healthcare workers accessed the service; 210 (22%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 12 (5.7%) tested positive. Clients reported high levels of concern about COVID-19 which declined with time, and faced barriers including lack of resources for infection prevention and control. There was a high prevalence of largely undiagnosed non-communicable disease: 61% were overweight or obese, 34% had a blood pressure of 140/90mmHg or above, 10% had an HbA1c diagnostic of diabetes, and 7% had an SSQ-14 score consistent with a common mental disorder. Overall 8% were HIV-positive, with 97% previously diagnosed and on treatment.Cases of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare workers mirrored the national epidemic curve. Implementation of comprehensive occupational health services during a pandemic was feasible, and uptake was high. Other comorbidities were highly prevalent, which may be risk factors for severe COVID-19 but are also important independent causes of morbidity and mortality. Healthcare workers are critical to combatting COVID-19; it is essential to support their physical and psychological wellbeing during the pandemic and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W3216039054,"The development and deployment of several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in a little over a year is an unprecedented achievement of modern medicine. The high levels of efficacy against transmission for some of these vaccines makes it feasible to use them to suppress SARS-CoV-2 altogether in regions with high vaccine acceptance. However, viral variants with reduced susceptibility to vaccinal and natural immunity threaten the utility of vaccines, particularly in scenarios where a return to pre-pandemic conditions occurs before the suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In this work we model the situation in the United States in May-June 2021, to demonstrate how pre-existing variants of SARS-CoV-2 may cause a rebound wave of COVID-19 in a matter of months under a certain set of conditions. A high burden of morbidity (and likely mortality) remains possible, even if the vaccines are partially effective against new variants and widely accepted. Our modeling suggests that variants that are already present within the population may be capable of quickly defeating the vaccines as a public health intervention, a serious potential limitation for strategies that emphasize rapid reopening before achieving control of SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W3216388590,"This study explored relations between COVID-19 news source, trust in COVID-19 information source, and COVID-19 health literacy in 194 STEM-oriented adolescents and young adults from the US and the UK. Analyses suggest that adolescents use both traditional news (e.g., TV or newspapers) and social media news to acquire information about COVID-19 and have average levels of COVID-19 health literacy. Hierarchical linear regression analyses suggest that the association between traditional news media and COVID-19 health literacy depends on participants’ level of trust in their government leader. For youth in both the US and the UK who used traditional media for information about COVID-19 and who have higher trust in their respective government leader (i.e., former US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson) had lower COVID-19 health literacy. Results highlight how youth are learning about the pandemic and the importance of not only considering their information source, but also their levels of trust in their government leaders."
https://openalex.org/W3215208962,"Early revascularization and treatment is key to improving clinical outcomes and reducing mortality in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). In low- and middle-income countries such as Bangladesh, timely management of AMI is challenging, with pre-hospital delays playing a significant role. This study was designed to investigate pre-hospital delay and its associated factors among patients presenting with AMI in the capital city of Dhaka.This retrospective cohort study was conducted on 333 patients presenting with AMI over a 3-month period at two of the largest primary reperfusion-capable tertiary cardiac care centres in Dhaka. Of the total patients, 239(71.8%) were admitted in the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Dhaka and 94(28.2%) at Ibrahim Cardiac Hospital & Research Institute, Dhaka Data were collected from patients by semi-structured interview and hospital medical records. Pre-hospital delay (median and inter-quartile range) was calculated. Statistical significance was determined by Chi-square test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was done to determine the independent predictors of pre-hospital delay.The mean age of the respondents was 53.8±11.2 years. Two-thirds (67.6%) of the respondents were males. Median total pre-hospital delay was 11.5 (IQR-18.3) hours with median decision time from symptom onset to seeking medical care being 3.0 (IQR: 11.0) hours. Nearly half (48.9%) of patients presented to the hospital more than 12 hours after symptom onset. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, AMI patients with absence of typical chest pain [OR 5.21; (95% CI: 2.5-9.9)], diabetes [OR: 1.7 (95% CI: 1.0-2.9)], residing/staying > 30 km away from nearest hospital at the time of onset [OR: 4.3(95% CI = 2.3-7.2)] and belonged to lower and middle class [OR: 1.9(95% CI = 1.0-3.5)] were significantly associated with pre-hospital delays.Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with atypical chest pain, diabetes, staying far away from nearest hospital and belonged to lower and middle socioeconomic strata were significantly associated with pre-hospital delays. The findings could have immense implications for improvements about timely reaching of AMI patients to the hospital within the context of their sociodemographic status and geographic barriers of the city."
https://openalex.org/W3215598075,"Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) medicine prescribed for anxiety. In this randomized controlled trial, we compared the subjective assessment of anxiety using questionnaires and its objective assessment using salivary alpha-amylase concentrations in YKS and control (CNT) groups of women undergoing breast surgery. The trial was registered at the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (registration number: UMIN000028998), and the investigators were blinded to drug administration. One hundred patients who underwent breast cancer surgery were allocated to either the YKS or the CNT group. Finally, 35 and 42 patients in the YKS and CNT groups were analyzed, respectively. The YKS group received two 2.5 g doses of the medication before sleeping on the night before surgery and 2 h before inducing anesthesia, while the CNT group did not receive medication preoperatively. Patients answered two questionnaires, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, pre-and postoperatively as subjective anxiety assessments. As an objective anxiety indicator, salivary alpha-amylase levels were measured the day before, directly before, and the day after surgery (T3). In the YKS group, salivary alpha-amylase scores directly before operation were significantly lower than those on the day before surgery and at one day postoperatively (F [2,150] = 3.76, p = 0.03). Moreover, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait scores were significantly more improved postoperatively in the YKS group than in the CNT group (difference in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety: YKS, mean -2.77, 95% confidence interval [-1.48 --4.06], p <0.001, and CNT, -1.43 [-0.25--2.61], p = 0.011; and difference in State-Trait Anxiety Inventory: YKS group, -4.23 [-6.95--1.51], p = 0.0004; and CNT group, 0.12 [-2.36-2.60], p = 0.92). No side effects were associated with YKS. YKS may reduce perioperative anxiety in patients undergoing surface surgery."
https://openalex.org/W3215931302,"Accurate maps of species ranges are essential to inform conservation, but time-consuming to produce and update. Given the pace of change of knowledge about species distributions and shifts in ranges under climate change and land use, a need exists for timely mapping approaches that enable batch processing employing widely available data. We develop a systematic approach of batch-processing range maps and derived Area of Habitat maps for terrestrial bird species with published ranges below 125,000 km2 in Central and South America. (Area of Habitat is the habitat available to a species within its range.) We combine existing range maps with the rapidly expanding crowd-sourced eBird data of presences and absences from frequently surveyed locations, plus readily accessible, high resolution satellite data on forest cover and elevation to map the Area of Habitat available to each species. Users can interrogate the maps produced to see details of the observations that contributed to the ranges. Previous estimates of Areas of Habitat were constrained within the published ranges and thus were, by definition, smaller-typically about 30%. This reflects how little habitat within suitable elevation ranges exists within the published ranges. Our results show that on average, Areas of Habitat are 12% larger than published ranges, reflecting the often-considerable extent that eBird records expand the known distributions of species. Interestingly, there are substantial differences between threatened and non-threatened species. Some 40% of Critically Endangered, 43% of Endangered, and 55% of Vulnerable species have Areas of Habitat larger than their published ranges, compared with 31% for Near Threatened and Least Concern species. The important finding for conservation is that threatened species are generally more widespread than previously estimated."
https://openalex.org/W3216118000,"Pain and inflammation are unpleasant experiences that usually occur as a result of tissue damage. Despite the number of existing analgesic drugs, side effects limit their use, stimulating the search for new therapeutic agents. In this sense, five hydrazone derivatives (H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5), with general structure R1R2C = NNR3R4, were synthesized with molecular modification strategies. In this paper, we describe the ability of hydrazone derivatives to attenuate nociceptive behavior and the inflammatory response in mice. Antinociceptive activity was evaluated through acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced nociception tests. In both experimental models, the hydrazone with the greatest potency (H5) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced nociceptive behavior. Additionally, methods of acute and chronic inflammation induced by different chemicals (carrageenan and histamine) were performed to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effect of H5. Moreover, molecular docking analysis revealed that H5 can block the COX-2 enzyme, reducing arachidonic acid metabolism and consequently decreasing the production of prostaglandins, which are important inflammatory mediators. H5 also changes locomotor activity. In summary, H5 exhibited relevant antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory potential and acted on several targets, making it a candidate for a new multi-target oral anti-inflammatory drug."
https://openalex.org/W3217086539,"Lysosomes are terminal, degradative organelles of the endosomal pathway that undergo repeated fusion-fission cycles with themselves, endosomes, phagosomes, and autophagosomes. Lysosome number and size depends on balanced fusion and fission rates. Thus, conditions that favour fusion over fission can reduce lysosome numbers while enlarging their size. Conversely, favouring fission over fusion may cause lysosome fragmentation and increase their numbers. PIKfyve is a phosphoinositide kinase that generates phosphatidylinositol-3,5-bisphosphate to modulate lysosomal functions. PIKfyve inhibition causes an increase in lysosome size and reduction in lysosome number, consistent with lysosome coalescence. This is thought to proceed through reduced lysosome reformation and/or fission after fusion with endosomes or other lysosomes. Previously, we observed that photo-damage during live-cell imaging prevented lysosome coalescence during PIKfyve inhibition. Thus, we postulated that lysosome fusion and/or fission dynamics are affected by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we show that ROS generated by various independent mechanisms all impaired lysosome coalescence during PIKfyve inhibition and promoted lysosome fragmentation during PIKfyve re-activation. However, depending on the ROS species or mode of production, lysosome dynamics were affected distinctly. H 2 O 2 impaired lysosome motility and reduced lysosome fusion with phagosomes, suggesting that H 2 O 2 reduces lysosome fusogenecity. In comparison, inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, thiol groups, glutathione, or thioredoxin, did not impair lysosome motility but instead promoted clearance of actin puncta on lysosomes formed during PIKfyve inhibition. Additionally, actin depolymerizing agents prevented lysosome coalescence during PIKfyve inhibition. Thus, we discovered that ROS can generally prevent lysosome coalescence during PIKfyve inhibition using distinct mechanisms depending on the type of ROS."
https://openalex.org/W3215372707,"Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is a key regulatory enzyme in the de novo synthesis of the purine base guanine. Dominant mutations in human IMPDH1 cause photoreceptor degeneration for reasons that are unknown. Here, we sought to provide some foundational information on Impdh1a in the zebrafish retina. We found that in zebrafish, gene subfunctionalization due to ancestral duplication resulted in a predominant retinal variant expressed exclusively in rod and cone photoreceptors. This variant is structurally and functionally similar to the human IMPDH1 retinal variant and shares a reduced sensitivity to GTP-mediated inhibition. We also demonstrated that Impdh1a forms prominent protein filaments in vitro and in vivo in both rod and cone photoreceptor cell bodies, synapses, and to a lesser degree, in outer segments. These filaments changed length and cellular distribution throughout the day consistent with diurnal changes in both mRNA and protein levels. The loss of Impdh1a resulted in a substantial reduction of guanine levels, although cellular morphology and cGMP levels remained normal. Our findings demonstrate a significant role for IMPDH1 in photoreceptor guanine production and provide fundamental new information on the details of this protein in the zebrafish retina."
https://openalex.org/W3215404320,"Recent evidence suggests that altered responses to affective touch-a pleasant interoceptive stimulus associated with activation of the C-Tactile (CT) system-may contribute to the aetiology and maintenance of mental conditions characterised by body image disturbances (e.g., Anorexia Nervosa). Here, we investigated whether tactile pleasantness and intensity differ across body sites, and if individual differences in dysmorphic appearance concerns and body and emotional awareness might be associated with touch perceptions across body sites. To this end, we measured perceived pleasantness and intensity of gentle, dynamic stroking touches applied to the palm, forearm, face, abdomen and back of 30 female participants (mean age: 25.87±1.17yrs) using CT-optimal (3 cm/s) and non-CT optimal (0.3 and 30 cm/s) stroking touch. As expected, participants rated CT-targeted touch as more pleasant compared to the two non-CT optimal stroking touch at all body sites. Regardless of stroking velocity, touch applied to the abdomen elicited the lowest pleasantness ratings. Lower levels of emotional awareness, greater levels of interoceptive sensibility and of dysmorphic concerns were associated with lower preference for CT-optimal stroking touch applied to the forearm and the back. These findings begin to elucidate the link between CT sensitivity, dysmorphic appearance concerns and body and emotional awareness, which may have implications for future research looking to inform early interventions. Addressing impaired processing of affective interoceptive stimuli, such as CT-targeted touch, may be the key to current treatment approaches available for those populations at risk of disorders characterised by body image disturbance."

https://openalex.org/W3217505417,"Practicing compassion has shown to reduce distress and increase emotional well-being in clinical and non-clinical populations. The existing research is primarily focused on Western populations although the concepts of compassion are heavily influenced by Asian Buddhist views. There is a dearth of compassion research conducted particularly in the Asian context. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the views and lived experiences of compassion in Sri Lankan students, to understand whether compassion is a socially embraced construct in Sri Lanka, considering that Sri Lanka is a Buddhist influenced society. Participants' views and lived experiences of compassion towards themselves and to/from others were also investigated, with a specific focus on their perceived inhibitors and facilitators of compassion. Aims were set to identify whether Western compassion-based practices could be successfully applied to Asian societies such as Sri Lanka. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis approach was used to obtain and analyse qualitative data from a convenience sample of 10 Sri Lankan students, recruited from a Psychology course. The phenomenological analysis of the semi-structured face-to-face interviews elicited three predominant themes: What compassion means to me, what I make of it, and compassion through facilitators and inhibitors. The findings suggested that participants shared a similar understanding of the concept of compassion as reflected in the Western definitions. Experiences and views of compassion were shaped by several factors including religion, culture, society, and upbringing. In general, this study revealed that participants were well aware of the concept of compassion as well as its impact on their psychological well-being. Despite this, inhibitors existed in experiencing compassion. The religious and collectivistic-cultural influences need to be further explored and taken into account when implementing Western compassion-based practices to non-Western contexts such as Sri Lanka."

However, the correlation between plantar fascial fibromatosis (PFF) and HZ remains unknown. This study investigated HZ risk in patients with PFF.Data was extracted from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000, which is a subsample of the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) Research Database and contains 1 million NHI beneficiaries. Between 2000 and 2012, patients diagnosed as having PFF were included in the case cohort. Every case was age and sex-matched with individuals without PFF through 1:4 frequency matching (control cohort). The end of the follow-up was defined as December 31, 2013, the date of HZ diagnosis, death, emigration, or withdrawal from the NHI program.In total, 4,729 patients were diagnosed as having PFF and were matched with 18,916 individuals without PFF. Patients with PFF were 1.23 times more likely to develop HZ than were those without PFF. Among those aged ≥65 years, patients with PFF had a higher HZ risk than did those without PFF (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 1.48). Men with PFF had a significantly higher risk of HZ than did men without PFF (aHR = 1.44).Patients with PFF, particularly older and male patients, having a high HZ risk and may thus be vaccinated for HZ."

This study aimed to describe the prevalence of H. pylori infection and outcomes of eradication treatment among Vietnamese patients who live in the same households.We conducted a prospective cohort study of Vietnamese household members with upper gastrointestinal complaints. Participants received esophagogastroduodenoscopy and H. pylori testing. The H. pylori-positive patients were treated and asked to return for follow-up within 4 months. To explore factors associated with H. pylori infection at baseline, we performed multilevel logistic regression to account for the clustering effect of living in the same households. To explore factors associated with eradication failure, we used Poisson regression with robust variance estimation to estimate the risk ratio.The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 83.5% and highest among children <12 years old (92.2%) in 1,272 patients from 482 households. There were variations in H. pylori infection across households (intraclass correlation = 0.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05, 0.33). Children aged <12 years had higher odds of H. pylori infection (odds ratio = 3.41, 95%CI 2.11, 5.50). At follow-up, H. pylori was eradicated in 264 of 341 patients (77.4%). The risk of eradication failure was lower for the sequential regimen with tetracycline.H. pylori infection was common among people living in the same households. Eradication success for H. pylori was higher for the tetracycline sequential regimen.

https://openalex.org/W3215743154,"Although making music is a popular leisure activity for children and adolescents, few stay musically engaged. Previous research has focused on finding reasons for quitting musical activities, pedagogical strategies to keep students engaged with music, and motivational factors of musical training. Nonetheless, we know very little about how the proportion of musically active children changes with age and what traits influence the survival of musical engagement. This study used longitudinal data from secondary school students in the UK and Germany aged between 10 and 17 years. A survival analysis was applied to investigate the trajectories of musical activities across this age span. Other factors like type of learned instrument, gender, personality and intelligence were taken into account for further analyses using generalized linear models. Results indicate that about 50% of all students drop out of music lessons and other musical activities by the time they turn 17 years old, with most students quitting between the ages of 15 and 17. Musical home environment is an important factor that is associated with lower drop out rates while conscientiousness and theory of musicality showed smaller significant associations."
https://openalex.org/W3216178313,"We apply Bayesian inference methods to a suite of distinct compartmental models of generalised SEIR type, in which diagnosis and quarantine are included via extra compartments. We investigate the evidence for a change in lethality of COVID-19 in late autumn 2020 in the UK, using age-structured, weekly national aggregate data for cases and mortalities. Models that allow a (step-like or graded) change in infection fatality rate (IFR) have consistently higher model evidence than those without. Moreover, they all infer a close to two-fold increase in IFR. This value lies well above most previously available estimates. However, the same models consistently infer that, most probably, the increase in IFR preceded the time window during which variant B.1.1.7 (alpha) became the dominant strain in the UK. Therefore, according to our models, the caseload and mortality data do not offer unequivocal evidence for higher lethality of a new variant . We compare these results for the UK with similar models for Germany and France, which also show increases in inferred IFR during the same period, despite the even later arrival of new variants in those countries. We argue that while the new variant(s) may be one contributing cause of a large increase in IFR in the UK in autumn 2020, other factors, such as seasonality, or pressure on health services, are likely to also have contributed."
https://openalex.org/W3216362977,"Due to their lithotrophic metabolisms, morphological complexity and conspicuous appearance, members of the Beggiatoaceae have been extensively studied for more than 100 years. These bacteria are known to be primarily sulfur-oxidizing autotrophs that commonly occur in dense mats at redox interfaces. Their large size and the presence of a mucous sheath allows these cells to serve as sites of attachment for communities of other microorganisms. But little is known about their individual niche preferences and attached microbiomes, particularly in marine environments, due to a paucity of cultivars and their prevalence in habitats that are difficult to access and study. Therefore, in this study, we compare Beggiatoaceae strain composition, community composition, and geochemical profiles collected from sulfidic sediments at four marine stations off the coast of Namibia. To elucidate community members that were directly attached and enriched in both filamentous Beggiatoaceae, namely Ca. Marithioploca spp. and Ca. Maribeggiatoa spp., as well as non-filamentous Beggiatoaceae, Ca. Thiomargarita spp., the Beggiatoaceae were pooled by morphotype for community analysis. The Beggiatoaceae samples collected from a highly sulfidic site were enriched in strains of sulfur-oxidizing Campylobacterota, that may promote a more hospitable setting for the Beggiatoaceae, which are known to have a lower tolerance for high sulfide to oxygen ratios. We found just a few host-specific associations with the motile filamentous morphotypes. Conversely, we detected 123 host specific enrichments with non-motile chain forming Beggiatoaceae. Potential metabolisms of the enriched strains include fermentation of host sheath material, syntrophic exchange of H2 and acetate, inorganic sulfur metabolism, and nitrite oxidation. Surprisingly, we did not detect any enrichments of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria as previously suggested and postulate that less well-studied anaerobic ammonium oxidation pathways may be occurring instead."

The aim of the present study was to explore whether maximal carotid plaque thickness (cPTmax) was increased in patients with chronic kidney disease compared to controls and associated with cardiovascular disease and severity of calcification in the carotid and coronary arteries.The study group consisted of 200 patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3 from the Copenhagen Chronic Kidney Disease Cohort and 121 age- and sex-matched controls. cPTmax was assessed by ultrasound and arterial calcification by computed tomography scanning.Carotid plaques were present in 58% of patients (n = 115) compared with 40% of controls (n = 48), p = 0.002. Among participants with plaques, cPTmax (median, interquartile range) was significantly higher in patients compared with controls (1.9 (1.4-2.3) versus 1.5 (1.2-1.8) mm), p = 0.001. Cardiovascular disease was present in 9% of patients without plaques (n = 85), 23% of patients with cPTmax 1.0-1.9 mm (n = 69) and 35% of patients with cPTmax >1.9 mm (n = 46), p = 0.001. Carotid and coronary calcium scores >400 were present in 0% and 4%, respectively, of patients with no carotid plaques, in 19% and 24% of patients with cPTmax 1.0-1.9 mm, and in 48% and 53% of patients with cPTmax >1.9 mm, p<0.001.This is the first study showing that cPTmax is increased in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 3 compared to controls and closely associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease and severity of calcification in both the carotid and coronary arteries."
https://openalex.org/W3215298697,"Objective numeracy, the ability to understand and use mathematical concepts, has been related to superior decisions and life outcomes. Unknown is whether it relates to greater satisfaction in life. We investigated numeracy’s relations with income satisfaction and overall life satisfaction in a diverse sample of 5,525 American adults. First, more numerate individuals had higher incomes; for every one point higher on the eight-item numeracy test, individuals reported $4,062 more in annual income, controlling for education and verbal intelligence. Combined, numeracy, education, and verbal intelligence explained 25% of the variance in income while Big-5 personality traits explained less than 4%. Further, the higher incomes associated with greater numeracy were related to more positive life evaluations (income and life satisfaction). Second, extant research also has indicated that the highly numerate compare numbers more than the less numerate. Consistent with numeracy-related income comparisons, numeracy moderated the relation between income and life evaluations, meaning that the same income was valued differently by those better and worse at math. Specifically, among those with lower incomes, the highly numerate were less satisfied than the less numerate; this effect reversed among those with higher incomes as if the highly numerate were aware of and made comparisons to others’ incomes. Further, no clear income satiation point was seen among those highest in numeracy, and satiation among the least numerate appeared to occur at a point below $50,000. Third, both education and verbal intelligence related to income evaluations in similar ways, and numeracy’s relations held when controlling for these other relations. Although causal claims cannot be made from cross-sectional data, these novel results indicate that numeracy may be an important factor underlying life evaluations and especially for evaluations concerning numbers such as incomes. Finally, this study adds to our understanding of education and intelligence effects in life satisfaction and happiness."
https://openalex.org/W3215440131,"Ischemia/reperfusion of organ systems in trauma patients with resuscitated hemorrhagic shock (HSR) contributes to tissue injury and organ dysfunction. Previous studies using a murine model of HSR showed that remote ischemic preconditioning (RIC) protected against organ injury and that the plasma was able to prevent neutrophil migration in a zebrafish tailfin-cut inflammation model. In this study, we hypothesized that RIC plasma inhibits neutrophil function through a decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production via the upregulation of the transcription factor Nrf2 and downstream antioxidative genes. Plasma from mice subjected to RIC (4 cycles of 5-min hindlimb ischemia/reperfusion) was microinjected into zebrafish. The results show that RIC plasma caused a reduction of ROS generation in response to tail injury. In addition, RIC plasma protected the fish larvae in the survival studies when exposed to either H2O2 or LPS. Oxidative stress PCR Array showed that RIC plasma treatment led to upregulation of antioxidative related genes including hsp70, hmox1a, nqo1 as well as downregulation of duox, the producer of H2O2. To explore the role of nrf2 in RIC, RIC plasma from Nrf2 KO mice were injected to the zebrafish and showed no inhibitory effect on neutrophil migration. Moreover, knockdown of nrf2a attenuated the anti-inflammatory and protective effect of RIC plasma. The downregulation of duox and upregulation of hmox1a were confirmed to require the activation of nrf2a. Therefore, we show that the protective effect of RIC may be related to the elaboration of humoral factors which counter injury-induced ROS generation in a nrf2-dependent fashion."
https://openalex.org/W3215570293,"Delays in patient flow and a shortage of hospital beds are commonplace in hospitals during periods of increased infection incidence, such as seasonal influenza and the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate the efficacy of machine learning methods at identifying and ranking the real-time readiness of individual patients for discharge, with the goal of improving patient flow within hospitals during periods of crisis.Electronic Health Record data from Oxford University Hospitals was used to train independent models to classify and rank patients' real-time readiness for discharge within 24 hours, for patient subsets according to the nature of their admission (planned or emergency) and the number of days elapsed since their admission. A strategy for the use of the models' inference is proposed, by which the model makes predictions for all patients in hospital and ranks them in order of likelihood of discharge within the following 24 hours. The 20% of patients with the highest ranking are considered as candidates for discharge and would therefore expect to have a further screening by a clinician to confirm whether they are ready for discharge or not. Performance was evaluated in terms of positive predictive value (PPV), i.e., the proportion of these patients who would have been correctly deemed as 'ready for discharge' after having the second screening by a clinician. Performance was high for patients on their first day of admission (PPV = 0.96/0.94 for planned/emergency patients respectively) but dropped for patients further into a longer admission (PPV = 0.66/0.71 for planned/emergency patients still in hospital after 7 days).We demonstrate the efficacy of machine learning methods at making operationally focused, next-day discharge readiness predictions for all individual patients in hospital at any given moment and propose a strategy for their use within a decision-support tool during crisis periods."

Yet, the mechanism through which BE develops to EAC still remain unclear. Moreover, the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in distinguishing BE from EAC still remains poorly understood. To identify differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and genes (DEGs) between EAC and BE from tissue samples, gene expression microarray datasets GSE13898, GSE26886, GSE1420 and miRNA microarray datasets GSE16456, GSE20099 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. GEO2R was used to screen the DEMs and DEGs. Pathway and functional enrichment analysis were performed by DAVID database. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING and been visualized by Cytoscape software. Finnal, survival analysis was performed basing TCGA database. A total of 21 DEMs were identified. The enriched functions and pathways analysis inclued Epstein-Barr virus infection, herpesvirus infection and TRP channels. GART, TNFSF11, GTSE1, NEK2, ICAM1, PSMD12, CTNNB1, CDH1, PSEN1, IL1B, CTNND1, JAG1, CDH17, ITCH, CALM1 and ITGA6 were considered as the hub-genes. Hsa-miR-143 and hsa-miR-133b were the highest connectivity target gene. JAG1 was predicted as the largest number of target miRNAs. The expression of hsa-miR-181d, hsa-miR-185, hsa-miR-15b, hsa-miR-214 and hsa-miR-496 was significantly different between normal tissue and EAC. CDH1, GART, GTSE1, NEK2 and hsa-miR-496, hsa-miR-214, hsa-miR-15b were found to be correlated with survival."
https://openalex.org/W3215812863,"The Internet has changed the way teachers and students access information and build knowledge. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for both teachers and students and a demand for new methodologies of remote learning. In the life sciences, mixing online content with practical activities represents an even greater challenge. In microbiology, the implementation of an active teaching methodology, the #Adopt project, based on the social network Facebook®, represents an excellent option for connecting remote education with classroom activities. In 2020, the version applied in high school, ""Adopt a Microorganism"", was adapted to meet the demands of emergency remote education owing to the suppression of face-to-face activities caused by the pandemic. In the present study, we assessed how the change in methodology impacted the discourse richness of students from high school integrated with technical education in the Business Administration program of the Federal Institute of São Paulo, Sorocaba Campus. Three questionnaires related to the groups of microorganisms (Archaea, Bacteria, Virus, Fungi, and Protozoan) were applied. The students' responses in the 2019 and 2020 classes were compared concerning content richness and multiplicity of concepts through the application of the Shannon diversity index, an approach that is generally used to assess biodiversity in different environments. The observed results suggest that remote learning provided students with a conceptual basis and richness of content equivalent to that achieved by students subjected to the hybrid teaching model. In conclusion, this study suggests that the #Adopt project methodology increases students' discourse richness in microbiology even without face-to-face traditional classes."
https://openalex.org/W3216057264,"Background In recent non-pandemic periods, tuberculosis (TB) has been the leading killer worldwide from a single infectious disease. Patients with DM are three times more likely to develop active TB and poor treatment outcomes. Single glycemic measurements at TB diagnosis may inaccurately diagnose or mischaracterize DM severity. Data are limited regarding glycemic dynamics from TB diagnosis through treatment. Methods Prospective study of glycemia dynamics in response to TB treatment measured glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients presenting to TB screening centres in Bangladesh to determine the prevalence and risk factors of hyperglycemia before and at TB treatment completion. Results 429 adults with active TB disease were enrolled and divided into groups based on history of DM and initial HbA1c range: normoglycemia, prediabetes, and DM. DM was diagnosed in 37%. At treatment completion,14(6%) patients from the normoglycemia and prediabetes groups had HbA1c&gt;6.5%, thus increasing the prevalence of DM to 39%. The number needed to screen to diagnose one new case of DM at TB diagnosis was 5.7 and 16 at treatment completion in the groups without DM. Weight gain&gt;5% at treatment completion significantly increased the risk of hyperglycemia in the groups without DM at TB diagnosis (95% CI 1.23–26.04, p&lt;0.05). Conclusion HbA1c testing prior to and at TB treatment completion found a high prevalence of prediabetes and DM, including a proportion found at treatment completion and commonly in people with a higher percentage of weight gain. Further longitudinal research is needed to understand the effects of TB disease and treatment on insulin resistance and DM complications."
https://openalex.org/W3217163210,"Cross-species transmission of pathogens is intimately linked to human and environmental health. With limited healthcare and challenging living conditions, people living in poverty may be particularly susceptible to endemic and emerging diseases. Similarly, wildlife is impacted by human influences, including pathogen sharing, especially for species in close contact with people and domesticated animals. Here we investigate human and animal contacts and human health in a community living around the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (BINP), Uganda. We used contact and health survey data to identify opportunities for cross-species pathogen transmission, focusing mostly on people and the endangered mountain gorilla. We conducted a survey with background questions and self-reported diaries to investigate 100 participants' health, such as symptoms and behaviours, and contact patterns, including direct contacts and sightings over a week. Contacts were revealed through networks, including humans, domestic, peri-domestic, and wild animal groups for 1) contacts seen in the week of background questionnaire completion, and 2) contacts seen during the diary week. Participants frequently felt unwell during the study, reporting from one to 10 disease symptoms at different intensity levels, with severe symptoms comprising 6.4% of the diary records and tiredness and headaches the most common symptoms. After human-human contacts, direct contact with livestock and peri-domestic animals were the most common. The contact networks were moderately connected and revealed a preference in contacts within the same taxon and within their taxa groups. Sightings of wildlife were much more common than touching. However, despite contact with wildlife being the rarest of all contact types, one direct contact with a gorilla with a timeline including concerning participant health symptoms was reported. When considering all interaction types, gorillas mostly exhibited intra-species contact, but were found to interact with five other species, including people and domestic animals. Our findings reveal a local human population with recurrent symptoms of illness in a location with intense exposure to factors that can increase pathogen transmission, such as direct contact with domestic and wild animals and proximity among animal species. Despite significant biases and study limitations, the information generated here can guide future studies, such as models for disease spread and One Health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3214832154,"A key challenge of environmental planning is to craft recommendations for future sustainable spatial development amid ubiquitous uncertainties. This paper aims to explore how different data uncertainties, usually unknown to the planner, may influence environmental planning recommendations. We apply a case study-based approach, in which we provide three illustrative examples of how data with different kinds and levels of uncertainty affect environmental assessments and, by that, the decision-support provided by environmental planning. The cases stem from different spatial levels in Germany and consider 'Regional soil-based climate change mitigation' in the region of Hannover, 'State-wide habitat conservation siting' in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, and 'National renewable energy planning'. Based on the three examples, we discuss implications for planning practice and derive recommendations for further research. The three cases studies illustrate the substantial effects of data uncertainty on environmental assessments and planning recommendations derived from those results. We identify four problem constellations of dealing with data uncertainty in environmental planning that relate to the severeness of uncertainty impacts, the responsibility of the decision-maker, and the kinds of impacts that wrong decisions may have. We close with recommendations for further research, among others to develop robust and pragmatic methods for identifying the uncertainty levels in environmental data and assessment results."

We aimed to externally validate the Potentially Avoidable Readmission-Risk Score (PAR-Risk Score), a 12-items prediction model for internal medicine patients with a convenient scoring system, for our local patient cohort.A cohort study using electronic health record data from the internal medicine ward of a Swiss tertiary teaching hospital was conducted. The individual PAR-Risk Score values were calculated for each patient. Univariable logistic regression was used to predict potentially avoidable readmissions (PARs), as identified by the SQLape algorithm. For additional analyses, patients were stratified into low, medium, and high risk according to tertiles based on the PAR-Risk Score. Statistical associations between predictor variables and PAR as outcome were assessed using both univariable and multivariable logistic regression.The final dataset consisted of 5,985 patients. Of these, 340 patients (5.7%) experienced a PAR. The overall PAR-Risk Score showed rather poor discriminatory power (C statistic 0.605, 95%-CI 0.575-0.635). When using stratified groups (low, medium, high), patients in the high-risk group were at statistically significant higher odds (OR 2.63, 95%-CI 1.33-5.18) of being readmitted within 30 days compared to low risk patients. Multivariable logistic regression identified previous admission within six months, anaemia, heart failure, and opioids to be significantly associated with PAR in this patient cohort.This external validation showed a limited overall performance of the PAR-Risk Score, although higher scores were associated with an increased risk for PAR and patients in the high-risk group were at significantly higher odds of being readmitted within 30 days. This study highlights the importance of externally validating prediction models."
https://openalex.org/W3215171661,"Background Somalia is considered severely underprepared to contain an outbreak of COVID-19, with critical shortages in healthcare personnel and treatment resources. In limited-resource settings such as Somalia, providing healthcare workers with adequate information on COVID-19 is crucial to improve patient outcomes and mitigate the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This study assessed the knowledge of, preparedness for, and perceptions toward COVID-19 prevention and treatment among Somali healthcare workers. Methods A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was completed by 364 Somali healthcare workers in summer of 2020 utilizing a convenience sampling method. Results Participants’ most accessed sources of COVID-19 information were from social media (64.8%), official government and international health organization websites (51.1%,), and traditional media sources such as radio, TV, and newspapers (48.1%). A majority of participants demonstrated strong knowledge of treatment of COVID-19, the severity of COVID-19, and the possible outcomes of COVID-19, but only 5 out of 10 symptoms listed were correctly identified by more than 75% of participants. Although participants indicated seeing a median number of 10 patients per week with COVID-19 related symptoms, access to essential medical resources, such as N95 masks (30.2%), facial protective shields (24.5%), and disposable gowns (21.4%), were limited. Moreover, 31.3% agreed that Somalia was in a good position to contain an emerging outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, 40.4% of participants agreed that the Somali government’s response to the pandemic was sufficient to protect Somali healthcare professionals. Conclusion This study provides evidence for the need to equip Somali healthcare providers with more information, personal protective equipment, and treatment resources such that they can safely and adequately care for COVID-19 patients and contain the spread of the virus. Social media and traditional news outlets may be effective outlets to communicate information regarding COVID-19 and the Somali government’s response to frontline healthcare workers."
https://openalex.org/W3215267059,"Background Clostridioides difficile (CD) is the most common healthcare-associated enteric infection. There is currently limited epidemiological evidence on CD incidence in South Africa. Aim To estimate the burden of CD infection (CDI) in the South African public sector between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2017. Methods A retrospective cohort study utilizing secondary data was conducted to describe the epidemiology of CD in South Africa. We assessed the patient-level association between variables of interest, CD, and CD recurrence, by undertaking both univariate and multivariable analysis. Adjusted incidence rate ratios (aIRR) were calculated utilizing multivariable Poisson regression. The incidence of CD, CD recurrence and CD testing was estimated by Poisson regression for various levels of care and provinces. Results A total of 14 023 samples were tested for CD during the study period. After applying exclusion criteria, we were left with a sample of 10 053 of which 1 860 (18.50%) tested CD positive. A positive and significant association between CDI and level of care is found, with patients treated in specialized tuberculosis (TB) hospitals having a five-fold increased adjusted incidence risk ratio (aIRR) for CDI (aIRR 4.96 CI95% 4.08–6.04,) compared to those managed in primary care. Patients receiving care at a secondary, tertiary, or central hospital had 35%, 66% and 41% increased adjusted incidence of CDI compared to those managed in primary care, respectively. National incidence of CDI is estimated at 53.89 cases per 100 000 hospitalizations (CI95% 51.58–56.29), the incidence of recurrence at 21.39 (CI95% 15.06–29.48) cases per 1 000 cases and a recurrence rate of 2.14% (CI95% 1.51–2.94). Conclusion Compared to European countries, we found a comparable incidence of CD. However, our estimates are lower than those for the United States. Compared to high-income countries, this study found a comparatively lower CD recurrence."

Here, we aimed to investigate changes in cerebral glucose metabolism before induction of epileptogenesis, during epileptogenesis as well as during chronic epilepsy. As anesthesia is usually unavoidable for preclinical PET imaging and influences the distribution of the radiotracer, four different protocols were compared.We investigated 18F-FDG uptake phase in conscious rats followed by a static scan as well as dynamic scans under continuous isoflurane, medetomidine-midazolam-fentanyl (MMF), or propofol anesthesia. Furthermore, we applied different analysis approaches: atlas-based regional analysis, statistical parametric mapping, and kinetic analysis.At baseline and compared to uptake in conscious rats, isoflurane and propofol anesthesia resulted in decreased cortical 18F-FDG uptake while MMF anesthesia led to a globally decreased tracer uptake. During epileptogenesis, MMF anesthesia was clearly best distinctive for visualization of prominently increased glucometabolism in epilepsy-related brain areas. Kinetic modeling further increased sensitivity, particularly for continuous isoflurane anesthesia. During chronic epilepsy, hypometabolism affecting more or less the whole brain was detectable with all protocols.This study reveals evaluation of anesthesia protocols for preclinical 18F-FDG PET imaging as a critical step in the study design. Together with an appropriate data analysis workflow, the chosen anesthesia protocol may uncover otherwise concealed disease-associated regional glucometabolic changes."
https://openalex.org/W3215975677,"Aberrant activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase)-MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway is involved in the progression of cancer, including urothelial carcinoma; but the negative regulation remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated pathological expression of Spred2 (Sprouty-related EVH1 domain-containing protein 2), a negative regulator of the Ras/Raf/ERK-MAPK pathway, and the relation to ERK activation and Ki67 index in various categories of 275 urothelial tumors obtained from clinical patients. In situ hybridization demonstrated that Spred2 mRNA was highly expressed in high-grade non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma (HGPUC), and the expression was decreased in carcinoma in situ (CIS) and infiltrating urothelial carcinoma (IUC). Immunohistochemically, membranous Spred2 expression, important to interact with Ras/Raf, was preferentially found in HGPUC. Interestingly, membranous Spred2 expression was decreased in CIS and IUC relative to HGPUC, while ERK activation and the expression of the cell proliferation marker Ki67 index were increased. HGPUC with membranous Spred2 expression correlated significantly with lower levels of ERK activation and Ki67 index as compared to those with negative Spred2 expression. Thus, our pathological findings suggest that Spred2 counters cancer progression in non-invasive papillary carcinoma possibly through inhibiting the Ras/Raf/ERK-MAPK pathway, but this regulatory mechanism is lost in cancers with high malignancy. Spred2 appears to be a key regulator in the progression of non-invasive bladder carcinoma."

Our aim is to provide a better estimate of the general population prevalence of PFP and to relate this to the level of physical activity, and demographic characteristics. The Survey instrument for Natural history, Aetiology and Prevalence of Patellofemoral pain Studies (SNAPPS) was developed as a PFP screening tool to be used in the community. The electronic version of the SNAPPS (eSNAPPS) has recently been validated and was used to survey attendees at mass-participation running events. We will use an electronic survey to collect data from a sample of 1100 Rugby League World Cup spectators. The survey will have four sections: i) general and demographic; ii) knee pain (eSNAPPS); iii) level of physical activity; and iv) quality of life in relation to knee pain. The primary analytic approach will be descriptive of PFP prevalence. Secondary analyses will explore the relationships of the presence of PFP and the other variables. We will disseminate this work by publication of peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals, presentations at scientific conferences, and on the dedicated SNAPPS website https://www.snappspfp.com/."

This study aimed to provide data regarding AMR in respiratory isolates, and identify relationships between respiratory and enteric AMD susceptibility, in weaned dairy heifers. A cross-sectional study was performed between June of 2019 and February 2020, on 6 calf rearing facilities in California. Deep nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected from 341 weaned heifers and submitted for selective bacterial culture and AMR testing. Mannheimia haemolytica , Pasteurella multocida , and Histophilus somni were selectively isolated from respiratory samples; Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. were selectively isolated from rectal swabs. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined for selected isolates against 19 AMD. The proportion of resistant isolates was calculated using Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (respiratory) or USDA NARMS (enteric) breakpoints; when no applicable breakpoint was available, the distribution of MIC was described and compared. Association between AMR in a calf’s respiratory isolate and a higher or lower MIC of the matched enteric isolates was determined. More than 50% of P . multocida isolates were resistant to each of 7 AMD commonly used to treat BRD (florfenicol, gamithromycin, tildipirosin, tilmicosin, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin and tetracycline). Resistance in respiratory isolates was only associated with higher matched enteric MIC for gamithromycin and tulathromycin. Multidrug resistance was reported in &gt;70% of P . multocida and M . haemolytica isolates. Antimicrobial resistance, including multidrug resistance, in respiratory isolates appears to be widespread in weaned dairy heifers; this finding has not previously been reported and raises concern for the future efficacy of AMD used to treat respiratory diseases in weaned dairy heifers. Enteric bacterial MIC appear to have limited direct association with respiratory isolate AMR classification."
https://openalex.org/W3216636314,"Despite widespread scholarly interest in values and attitudes among Muslim populations, relatively little work has focused on specific attitudes popularly thought to indicate anti-modern or anti-liberal tendencies within Islam. In this article, we use data from the Pew Research Center from 2008-2012 to examine support for violent practices among Muslims in thirty-five countries. Support for violent practices is defined by three questions on the acceptability of killing apostates, the stoning of adulterers, and severe corporal punishment for thieves. Using multilevel models that capture country-level variability, we analyze the relationship between support for violent practices and education, religiosity, and development. In general, we find that support for violent practices is less common among individuals with more education and less religiosity and who come from more developed countries. However, when we examine variation across countries, we see evidence of substantial heterogeneity in the association of education and religiosity with support for violent practices. We find that education is more liberalizing in more liberal countries and in less developed countries. The effects of religiosity are also related to country-level context but vary depending on how religiosity is measured. Overall, the variation we observe across countries calls into question a civilizational approach to studying values among Muslim populations and points to a more detailed multiple modernities approach."
https://openalex.org/W3217074953,"Biomass and carbon (C) distribution are suggested as strategies of plant responses to resource stress. Understanding the distribution patterns of biomass and C is the key to vegetation restoration in fragile ecosystems, however, there is limited understanding of the intraspecific biomass and C distributions of shrubs resulting from plant interactions in karst areas. In this study, three vegetation restoration types, a Dodonaea viscosa monoculture (DM), a Eucalyptus maideni and D. viscosa mixed-species plantation (EDP) and a Pinus massoniana and D. viscosa mixed-species plantation (PDP), were selected to determine the effects of plant interactions on the variations in the C distributions of D. viscosa among the three vegetation restoration types following 7 years of restoration. The results showed that: (1) plant interactions decreased the leaf biomass fraction. The interaction of P. massoniana and D. viscosa decreased the branch biomass fraction and increased the stem and root biomass fraction, but not the interaction of E. maideni and D. viscosa. Plant interactions changed the C concentrations of stems and roots rather than those of leaves and branches. (2) Plant interactions affected the soil nutrients and forest characteristics significantly. Meanwhile, the biomass distribution was affected by soil total nitrogen, clumping index and gap fraction; the C concentrations were influenced by the leaf area index and soil total phosphorus. (3) The C storage proportions of all the components correlated significantly with the proportion of biomass. Our results suggested that both the biomass distribution and C concentration of D. viscosa were affected by plant interactions, however, the biomass fraction not the C concentration determines the C storage fraction characteristics for D. viscosa."
https://openalex.org/W3217660521,"The COBRA-like (COBL) genes play key roles in cell anisotropic expansion and the orientation of microfibrils. Mutations in these genes cause the brittle stem and induce pathogen responsive phenotypes in Arabidopsis and several crop plants. In this study, an in silico genome-wide analysis was performed to identify the COBL family members in Brassica. We identified 44, 20 and 23 COBL genes in B. napus and its diploid progenitor species B. rapa and B. oleracea, respectively. All the predicted COBL genes were phylogenetically clustered into two groups: the AtCOB group and the AtCOBL7 group. The conserved chromosome locations of COBLs in Arabidopsis and Brassica, together with clustering, indicated that the expansion of the COBL gene family in B. napus was primarily attributable to whole-genome triplication. Among the BnaCOBLs, 22 contained all the conserved motifs and derived from 9 of 12 subgroups. RNA-seq analysis was used to determine the tissue preferential expression patterns of various subgroups. BnaCOBL9, BnaCOBL35 and BnaCOBL41 were highly expressed in stem with high-breaking resistance, which implies these AtCOB subgroup members may be involved in stem development and stem breaking resistance of rapeseed. Our results of this study may help to elucidate the molecular properties of the COBRA gene family and provide informative clues for high stem-breaking resistance studies."

https://openalex.org/W3214840056,"In the United States the marketing of dietary supplements, of which the majority are herbal supplements, is currently a multibillion-dollar industry involving use from over half of the adult population. Due to their frequency of use and the lack of regulation of herbal supplements by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) it is important for the health and safety of consumers to know about consistency of supplements and any possible contamination by harmful products, such as heavy metals or microorganisms. The purpose of the study was to determine consistency and contamination within and between bottles of common herbal supplements. Duplicate bottles of 29 herbal supplements were tested for consistency for antioxidant activity, phenolic concentration and flavonoid concentration under methanolic and water extraction. The supplements were also analyzed for the presence of metals and fungal contaminants. For all of the supplements tested there was high variability around the mean in antioxidant activity, phenolic concentrations and flavonoid concentrations, with coefficients of variation (CV) ranging from 0-120. Zinc was found in almost 90% of the supplements, nickel in about half of the supplements and lead in none of the supplements. Approximately 60% of the supplements contained fungal isolates. Although the majority of the fungi that were found in the supplements are generally not hazardous to human health, many of them could be problematic to sensitive groups, such as immunocompromised individuals. The data, which demonstrates contamination and a lack of consistency, in conjunction with previous studies on supplement contamination, strengthen the case that the FDA should regulate over-the-counter herbal supplements the same way that they regulate food and drugs. Until such time it is crucial that consumers are informed that many of the supplements that they take may lack the standardization that would reduce the chance of contamination and lead to consistency from one pill to the next."
https://openalex.org/W3215458501,"""Chūnibyō"" is a term that represents a distinctive, transient mental state during puberty in Japan, but its characteristics and precise definition have not been standardized. Increased awareness of chūnibyō could lead to a better environment for those who experience it. This study aimed to identify the characteristics of and problems related to chūnibyō using an anonymous questionnaire.An anonymous online questionnaire was conducted in February 2021 in Japan. In total, 314 volunteers completed the anonymous online questionnaire. Respondents were divided into the chūnibyō group (n = 122) and the non-chūnibyō group (n = 192), and the questionnaire responses were compared between the two groups. Furthermore, the responses were compared between the chūnibyō with problems subgroup (n = 82) and the other subgroup (n = 232). The main outcome was the identification of the chūnibyō group based on the responses to the item ""I have experienced chūnibyō"" or ""I have been told that I exhibited chūnibyō"".The median age of the chūnibyō group was 31 years old; this group was predominantly male (n = 79, 64.8%) and had a relatively high proportion of respondents with any problems (n = 82, 67.2%). The chūnibyō group had higher proportions of respondents who felt that academic tests did not reflect their true worth (n = 58 (47.5%) vs. n = 66 (35.4%), p = 0.024), who felt uncomfortable in the world (n = 77 (61.1%) vs. n = 67 (34.9%), p<0.001), and who had an imaginary/fantasy friend or boyfriend/girlfriend (n = 39 (32.0%) vs. n = 10 (5.2%), p<0.001). The results were similar between the chūnibyō with problems subgroup and the other subgroup. Eighty respondents (25.4%) had negative impressions of chūnibyō, whereas twenty-one respondents (6.7%) had positive impressions.This study is the first to report the characteristics of chūnibyō by collecting the experiences and thoughts of people who experienced chūnibyō."
https://openalex.org/W3215461270,"Recent studies forecast that many ectothermic animals, especially aquatic stenotherms, may not be able to thrive or even survive predicted climate change. These projections, however, generally do not call much attention to the role of behavior, an essential thermoregulatory mechanism of many ectotherms. Here we characterize species-specific locomotor and respiratory responses to acute ambient warming in two highly stenothermic Antarctic Notothenioid fishes, one of which (Chaenocephalus aceratus) lacks hemoglobin and appears to be less tolerant to thermal stress as compared to the other (Notothenia coriiceps), which expresses hemoglobin. At the onset of ambient warming, both species perform distinct locomotor maneuvers that appear to include avoidance reactions. In response to unavoidable progressive hyperthermia, fishes demonstrate a range of species-specific maneuvers, all of which appear to provide some mitigation of the deleterious effects of obligatory thermoconformation and to compensate for increasing metabolic demand by enhancing the efficacy of branchial respiration. As temperature continues to rise, Chaenocephalus aceratus supplements these behaviors with intensive pectoral fin fanning which may facilitate cutaneous respiration through its scaleless integument, and Notothenia coriiceps manifests respiratory-locomotor coupling during repetitive startle-like maneuvers which may further augment gill ventilation. The latter behaviors, found only in Notothenia coriiceps, have highly stereotyped appearance resembling Fixed Action Pattern sequences. Altogether, this behavioral flexibility could contribute to the reduction of the detrimental effects of acute thermal stress within a limited thermal range. In an ecologically relevant setting, this may enable efficient thermoregulation of fishes by habitat selection, thus facilitating their resilience in persistent environmental change."
https://openalex.org/W3216779930,"Many claim that social stimuli are rewarding to primates, but few, if any, studies have explicitly demonstrated their reward value. Here, we examined whether chimpanzees would produce overt responses for the opportunity to view conspecific social, compared to dynamic (video: Experiment 1) and static (picture: Experiment 2) control content. We also explored the relationships between variation in social reward and social behavior and cognition. We provided captive chimpanzees with access to a touchscreen during four, one-hour sessions (two 'conspecific social' and two 'control'). The sessions consisted of ten, 15-second videos (or pictures in Experiment 2) of either chimpanzees engaging in a variety of behaviors (social condition) or vehicles, humans, or other animals engaged in some activity (control condition). For each chimpanzee, we recorded the number of responses to the touchscreen and the frequency of watching the stimuli. Independent t-tests revealed no sex or rearing differences in touching and watching the social or control videos (p>0.05). Repeated measures ANOVAs showed chimpanzees touched and watched the screen significantly more often during the social compared to control video sessions. Furthermore, although chimpanzees did not touch the screen more often during social than control picture sessions in Experiment 2, they did watch the screen more often. Additionally, chimpanzees that previously performed better on a task of social cognition and engaged in more affiliative behavior watched a higher percentage of social videos during the touchscreen task. These results are consistent with the social motivation theory, and indicate social stimuli are intrinsically rewarding, as chimpanzees made more overt responses for the opportunity to view conspecific social, compared to control, content."
https://openalex.org/W3217327576,"To evaluate changes in choroidal vascular structure and aqueous cytokine levels in eyes with vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL) after intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) treatment.In this retrospective study, VRL patients who visited our hospital between October 2018 and July 2020 were reviewed. Aqueous samples were obtained before treatment and at clinical resolution after intravitreal MTX therapy. Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels and the IL-10-to-IL-6 ratio were evaluated. Swept-source optical coherence tomographic images were obtained along with the aqueous samples. Subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), total vascular area of the choroid (TCA), stromal area (SA), luminal area (LA), and choroidal vascularity index (CVI) were assessed.Twelve patients were enrolled (female:male-5:7). The mean age (± standard deviation) at diagnosis was 60.9±8.5 years. In the 16 eyes diagnosed with VRL, values of SFCT, TCA, LA, and SA significantly decreased after treatment (all p-values <0.05). Additionally, the aqueous cytokine IL-10 level and IL-10-to-IL-6 ratio were significantly decreased (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). The choroidal structure in the non-treated fellow eyes did not show any significant difference. There were no further changes in SFCT, TCA, LA, or CVI that occurred during maintenance therapy. For clinical remission, the patients received 7.7±5.5 intravitreal MTX injections. The required number of injections for clinical remission was positively correlated with best-corrected visual acuity, IL-10, and IL-6 levels in the active phase (p = 0.035, p = 0.009, and p = 0.031, respectively).Eyes with active VRL exhibited choroidal thickening with increased vascular and stromal areas that decreased after remission following MTX treatment. Higher aqueous IL-10 and IL-6 levels and lower visual acuity in the active phase may indicate the number of injections required for remission; this should be considered in the treatment of patients with VRL."
