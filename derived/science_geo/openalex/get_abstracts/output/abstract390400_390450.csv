https://openalex.org/W2032211985,"Clinical trials in melanoma patients carrying B-RAF gene mutations have shown promising results with the B-RAF kinase inhibitor PLX4032, but many patients go on to become resistant. Two papers now uncover possible mechanisms for this resistance. Nazarian et al. report that melanomas can acquire resistance due to mutations of N-RAS or increased expression of PDGFRβ, and Johannessen et al. report resistance due to upregulation of MAP3K8/COT. Each of these mechanisms seems to apply to some patients in the recent PLX4032 trial, yet surprisingly, no secondary B-RAF mutations were observed. Recent data from early clinical trials in melanoma patients carrying mutations in the B-RAF gene have shown promising results with the B-RAF kinase inhibitor PLX4032; however, many patients eventually develop resistance to this treatment. Two papers now uncover possible mechanisms of resistance to PLX4032. One paper shows that upregulation of MAP3K8 (which encodes COT) can confer resistance of melanoma cells to B-RAF inhibitors, whereas another paper found that melanomas can acquire resistance due to mutations of N-RAS or increased expression of PDGFRβ. Each of these resistance mechanisms seems to apply to at least some patients on recent PLX4032 trial, whereas, surprisingly, so far no secondary B-RAF mutations have been observed. Activating B-RAF(V600E) (also known as BRAF) kinase mutations occur in ∼7% of human malignancies and ∼60% of melanomas1. Early clinical experience with a novel class I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032, demonstrated an unprecedented 80% anti-tumour response rate among patients with B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, but acquired drug resistance frequently develops after initial responses2. Hypotheses for mechanisms of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E), MAPK reactivation, and activation of alternative survival pathways3,4,5. Here we show that acquired resistance to PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRβ (also known as PDGFRB) upregulation or N-RAS (also known as NRAS) mutations but not through secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E). We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines artificially derived from B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched, short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFRβ RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sub-lines, patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFRβ-upregulated tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032, do not reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFRβ or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRβ or N-RAS(Q61K) conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape B-RAF(V600E) targeting not through secondary B-RAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2141674733,"Oncogenic mutations in the serine/threonine kinase B-RAF (also known as BRAF) are found in 50–70% of malignant melanomas1. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the B-RAF(V600E) mutation predicts a dependency on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade in melanoma2,3,4,5,6—an observation that has been validated by the success of RAF and MEK inhibitors in clinical trials7,8,9. However, clinical responses to targeted anticancer therapeutics are frequently confounded by de novo or acquired resistance10,11,12. Identification of resistance mechanisms in a manner that elucidates alternative ‘druggable’ targets may inform effective long-term treatment strategies13. Here we expressed ∼600 kinase and kinase-related open reading frames (ORFs) in parallel to interrogate resistance to a selective RAF kinase inhibitor. We identified MAP3K8 (the gene encoding COT/Tpl2) as a MAPK pathway agonist that drives resistance to RAF inhibition in B-RAF(V600E) cell lines. COT activates ERK primarily through MEK-dependent mechanisms that do not require RAF signalling. Moreover, COT expression is associated with de novo resistance in B-RAF(V600E) cultured cell lines and acquired resistance in melanoma cells and tissue obtained from relapsing patients following treatment with MEK or RAF inhibitors. We further identify combinatorial MAPK pathway inhibition or targeting of COT kinase activity as possible therapeutic strategies for reducing MAPK pathway activation in this setting. Together, these results provide new insights into resistance mechanisms involving the MAPK pathway and articulate an integrative approach through which high-throughput functional screens may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2077650355,"Sugar efflux transporters are essential for the maintenance of animal blood glucose levels, plant nectar production, and plant seed and pollen development. Despite broad biological importance, the identity of sugar efflux transporters has remained elusive. Using optical glucose sensors, we identified a new class of sugar transporters, named SWEETs, and show that at least six out of seventeen Arabidopsis, two out of over twenty rice and two out of seven homologues in Caenorhabditis elegans, and the single copy human protein, mediate glucose transport. Arabidopsis SWEET8 is essential for pollen viability, and the rice homologues SWEET11 and SWEET14 are specifically exploited by bacterial pathogens for virulence by means of direct binding of a bacterial effector to the SWEET promoter. Bacterial symbionts and fungal and bacterial pathogens induce the expression of different SWEET genes, indicating that the sugar efflux function of SWEET transporters is probably targeted by pathogens and symbionts for nutritional gain. The metazoan homologues may be involved in sugar efflux from intestinal, liver, epididymis and mammary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1968188734,"The plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells have an asymmetrical distribution of phospholipids. Lipid asymmetry can be disrupted during biological processes such as apoptosis, when phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of the membrane is exposed on the outer membrane. It has been proposed that activation of a phospholipid scramblase catalyses bidirectional transbilayer movement of phospholipids, and now a protein corresponding to this activity has been identified as TMEM16F, a member of the TMEM16 family of transmembrane proteins. Furthermore, a patient with Scott syndrome, which results from a defect in phospholipid scrambling activity, was found to carry a mutation in the gene encoding TMEM16F. Lipid asymmetry can be disrupted during biological processes such as apoptosis, during which phosphatidylserine in the inner leaflet of the membrane is exposed on the outer membrane. It has been proposed that activation of a phospholipid scramblase catalyses bidirectional transbilayer movement of phospholipids, but the protein corresponding to this activity has not been identified. Here, the protein TMEM16F is identified, and is an essential component for the Ca2+-dependent exposure of phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane. A patient with Scott syndrome, which results from a defect in phospholipid scrambling activity, was found to carry a mutation in the gene encoding TMEM16F. In all animal cells, phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed between the outer and inner leaflets of the plasma membrane1. This asymmetrical phospholipid distribution is disrupted in various biological systems. For example, when blood platelets are activated, they expose phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) to trigger the clotting system2,3. The PtdSer exposure is believed to be mediated by Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scramblases that transport phospholipids bidirectionally1,4, but its molecular mechanism is still unknown. Here we show that TMEM16F (transmembrane protein 16F) is an essential component for the Ca2+-dependent exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface. When a mouse B-cell line, Ba/F3, was treated with a Ca2+ ionophore under low-Ca2+ conditions, it reversibly exposed PtdSer. Using this property, we established a Ba/F3 subline that strongly exposed PtdSer by repetitive fluorescence-activated cell sorting. A complementary DNA library was constructed from the subline, and a cDNA that caused Ba/F3 to expose PtdSer spontaneously was identified by expression cloning. The cDNA encoded a constitutively active mutant of TMEM16F, a protein with eight transmembrane segments5. Wild-type TMEM16F was localized on the plasma membrane and conferred Ca2+-dependent scrambling of phospholipids. A patient with Scott syndrome6,7, which results from a defect in phospholipid scrambling activity8,9, was found to carry a mutation at a splice-acceptor site of the gene encoding TMEM16F, causing the premature termination of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2103752582,"Bose-Einstein condensation, the macroscopic ground state accumulation of particles with integer spin (bosons) at low temperature and high density, has been observed in several physical systems, including cold atomic gases and solid state physics quasiparticles. However, the most omnipresent Bose gas, blackbody radiation (radiation in thermal equilibrium with the cavity walls) does not show this phase transition, because the chemical potential of photons vanishes and, when the temperature is reduced, photons disappear in the cavity walls. Theoretical works have considered photon number conserving thermalization processes, a prerequisite for Bose-Einstein condensation, using Compton scattering with a gas of thermal electrons, or using photon-photon scattering in a nonlinear resonator configuration. In a recent experiment, we have observed number conserving thermalization of a two-dimensional photon gas in a dye-filled optical microcavity, acting as a 'white-wall' box for photons. Here we report on the observation of a Bose-Einstein condensation of photons in a dye-filled optical microcavity. The cavity mirrors provide both a confining potential and a non-vanishing effective photon mass, making the system formally equivalent to a two-dimensional gas of trapped, massive bosons. By multiple scattering off the dye molecules, the photons thermalize to the temperature of the dye solution (room temperature). Upon increasing the photon density we observe the following signatures for a BEC of photons: Bose-Einstein distributed photon energies with a massively populated ground state mode on top of a broad thermal wing, the phase transition occurring both at the expected value and exhibiting the predicted cavity geometry dependence, and the ground state mode emerging even for a spatially displaced pump spot."
https://openalex.org/W2066953183,"Members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family control cytoskeletal dynamics by promoting actin filament nucleation with the Arp2/3 complex. The WASP relative WAVE regulates lamellipodia formation within a 400-kilodalton, hetero-pentameric WAVE regulatory complex (WRC). The WRC is inactive towards the Arp2/3 complex, but can be stimulated by the Rac GTPase, kinases and phosphatidylinositols. Here we report the 2.3-ångstrom crystal structure of the WRC and complementary mechanistic analyses. The structure shows that the activity-bearing VCA motif of WAVE is sequestered by a combination of intramolecular and intermolecular contacts within the WRC. Rac and kinases appear to destabilize a WRC element that is necessary for VCA sequestration, suggesting the way in which these signals stimulate WRC activity towards the Arp2/3 complex. The spatial proximity of the Rac binding site and the large basic surface of the WRC suggests how the GTPase and phospholipids could cooperatively recruit the complex to membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2022046477,"Kinetochores are macromolecular machines that couple chromosomes to dynamic microtubule tips during cell division, thereby generating force to segregate the chromosomes. Accurate segregation depends on selective stabilization of correct 'bi-oriented' kinetochore-microtubule attachments, which come under tension as the result of opposing forces exerted by microtubules. Tension is thought to stabilize these bi-oriented attachments indirectly, by suppressing the destabilizing activity of a kinase, Aurora B. However, a complete mechanistic understanding of the role of tension requires reconstitution of kinetochore-microtubule attachments for biochemical and biophysical analyses in vitro. Here we show that native kinetochore particles retaining the majority of kinetochore proteins can be purified from budding yeast and used to reconstitute dynamic microtubule attachments. Individual kinetochore particles maintain load-bearing associations with assembling and disassembling ends of single microtubules for >30 min, providing a close match to the persistent coupling seen in vivo between budding yeast kinetochores and single microtubules. Moreover, tension increases the lifetimes of the reconstituted attachments directly, through a catch bond-like mechanism that does not require Aurora B. On the basis of these findings, we propose that tension selectively stabilizes proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments in vivo through a combination of direct mechanical stabilization and tension-dependent phosphoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2141581617,"Macroscopic quantum phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, ferrimagnetism and ferromagnetism arise from a delicate balance of different interactions among electrons, phonons and spins on the nanoscale. The study of the interplay among these various degrees of freedom in strongly coupled electron-lattice systems is thus crucial to their understanding and for optimizing their properties. Charge-density-wave (CDW) materials, with their inherent modulation of the electron density and associated periodic lattice distortion, represent ideal model systems for the study of such highly cooperative phenomena. With femtosecond time-resolved techniques, it is possible to observe these interactions directly by abruptly perturbing the electronic distribution while keeping track of energy relaxation pathways and coupling strengths among the different subsystems. Numerous time-resolved experiments have been performed on CDWs, probing the dynamics of the electronic subsystem. However, the dynamics of the periodic lattice distortion have been only indirectly inferred. Here we provide direct atomic-level information on the structural dynamics by using femtosecond electron diffraction to study the quasi two-dimensional CDW system 1T-TaS(2). Effectively, we have directly observed the atomic motions that result from the optically induced change in the electronic spatial distribution. The periodic lattice distortion, which has an amplitude of ∼0.1 Å, is suppressed by about 20% on a timescale (∼250 femtoseconds) comparable to half the period of the corresponding collective mode. These highly cooperative, electronically driven atomic motions are accompanied by a rapid electron-phonon energy transfer (∼350 femtoseconds) and are followed by fast recovery of the CDW (∼4 picoseconds). The degree of cooperativity in the observed structural dynamics is remarkable and illustrates the importance of obtaining atomic-level perspectives of the processes directing the physics of strongly correlated systems."
https://openalex.org/W2119270583,"Carotenoids are the precursors for vitamin A and are proposed to prevent oxidative damage to cells. Mammalian genomes encode a family of structurally related nonheme iron oxygenases that modify double bonds of these compounds by oxidative cleavage and cis-to-trans isomerization. The roles of the family members BCMO1 and RPE65 for vitamin A production and vision have been well established. Surprisingly, we found that the third family member, β,β-carotene-9',10'-oxygenase (BCDO2), is a mitochondrial carotenoid-oxygenase with broad substrate specificity. In BCDO2-deficient mice, carotenoid homeostasis was abrogated, and carotenoids accumulated in several tissues. In hepatic mitochondria, accumulated carotenoids induced key markers of mitochondrial dysfunction, such as manganese superoxide dismutase (9-fold), and reduced rates of ADP-dependent respiration by 30%. This impairment was associated with an 8- to 9-fold induction of phosphor-MAP kinase and phosphor-AKT, markers of cell signaling pathways related to oxidative stress and disease. Administration of carotenoids to human HepG2 cells depolarized mitochondrial membranes and resulted in the production of reactive oxygen species. Thus, our studies in BCDO2-deficient mice and human cell cultures indicate that carotenoids can impair respiration and induce oxidative stress. Mammalian cells thus express a mitochondrial carotenoid-oxygenase that degrades carotenoids to protect these vital organelles."
https://openalex.org/W2160368760,"Tumorigenesis is a multistep process that results from the sequential accumulation of mutations in key oncogene and tumour suppressor pathways. Personalized cancer therapy that is based on targeting these underlying genetic abnormalities presupposes that sustained inactivation of tumour suppressors and activation of oncogenes is essential in advanced cancers. Mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor pathway are common in human cancer and significant efforts towards pharmaceutical reactivation of defective p53 pathways are underway. Here we show that restoration of p53 in established murine lung tumours leads to significant but incomplete tumour cell loss specifically in malignant adenocarcinomas, but not in adenomas. We define amplification of MAPK signalling as a critical determinant of malignant progression and also a stimulator of Arf tumour-suppressor expression. The response to p53 restoration in this context is critically dependent on the expression of Arf. We propose that p53 not only limits malignant progression by suppressing the acquisition of alterations that lead to tumour progression, but also, in the context of p53 restoration, responds to increased oncogenic signalling to mediate tumour regression. Our observations also underscore that the p53 pathway is not engaged by low levels of oncogene activity that are sufficient for early stages of lung tumour development. These data suggest that restoration of pathways important in tumour progression, as opposed to initiation, may lead to incomplete tumour regression due to the stage-heterogeneity of tumour cell populations."
https://openalex.org/W1973748124,"Inactivation of the p53 tumour-suppressor pathway is a common feature of human cancers, prompting suggestions that restoring p53 function in established tumours might be an effective therapy. However, two papers in this week's Nature highlight a practical limitation of p53-directed cancer therapeutics. They show in a K-Ras-driven lung-cancer model that p53-mediated tumour suppression is engaged only at a late stage of tumour progression, when the K-Ras oncogenic signal reaches a threshold that is sufficient to activate the ARF-p53 pathway. This means that p53 re-expression fails to restrict the early stages of tumorigenesis, although it does induce regression of more aggressive tumours. p53 is an important tumour suppressor gene. Two papers now show in a Kras-driven lung cancer model that p53-mediated tumour suppression is only engaged late during tumour progression, when the Kras oncogenic signal reaches a threshold sufficient to activate the ARF–p53 pathway. Therefore, p53 re-expression in p53-deficient lung tumours does not restrict early stages of tumorigenesis, but induces tumour regression of more aggressive tumours. Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 10–15%1. Deregulation of the Ras pathway is a frequent hallmark of NSCLC, often through mutations that directly activate Kras2. p53 is also frequently inactivated in NSCLC and, because oncogenic Ras can be a potent trigger of p53 (ref. 3), it seems likely that oncogenic Ras signalling has a major and persistent role in driving the selection against p53. Hence, pharmacological restoration of p53 is an appealing therapeutic strategy for treating this disease4. Here we model the probable therapeutic impact of p53 restoration in a spontaneously evolving mouse model of NSCLC initiated by sporadic oncogenic activation of endogenous Kras5. Surprisingly, p53 restoration failed to induce significant regression of established tumours, although it did result in a significant decrease in the relative proportion of high-grade tumours. This is due to selective activation of p53 only in the more aggressive tumour cells within each tumour. Such selective activation of p53 correlates with marked upregulation in Ras signal intensity and induction of the oncogenic signalling sensor p19 ARF(ref. 6). Our data indicate that p53-mediated tumour suppression is triggered only when oncogenic Ras signal flux exceeds a critical threshold. Importantly, the failure of low-level oncogenic Kras to engage p53 reveals inherent limits in the capacity of p53 to restrain early tumour evolution and in the efficacy of therapeutic p53 restoration to eradicate cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2171018097,"The large size of the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) and its low natural abundance combine to make quantitative structural and mechanistic studies of the complex difficult. Two linked papers take on the challenge. Schreiber et al. have reconstituted the entire APC/C complex and, in combination with structural studies, provide a pseudo-atomic model for 70% of the complex. These results contribute towards a molecular understanding of the roles of individual subunits in APC/C assembly and their interactions with co-activators, substrates and regulatory proteins. Da Fonseca et al. present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of APC/CCdh1 bound to a D-box peptide substrate. The structure provides insight into the recognition and catalytic mechanism of APC/C substrates. The anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is a large multimeric ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates the eukaryotic cell cycle in processes such as chromatid segregation and completion of mitosis. It catalyses the polyubiquitylation of a diverse array of mitotic regulatory proteins and targets them for proteasomal degradation. Target selection also involves a co-activator protein (either Cdc20 or Cdh1) together with core APC/C subunits. Here, a cryo-EM structure of APC/CChd1 bound to a D-box peptide substrate is presented. The structure provides important insight into the recognition and catalytic mechanism of APC/C substrates. The ubiquitylation of cell-cycle regulatory proteins by the large multimeric anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) controls sister chromatid segregation and the exit from mitosis1,2. Selection of APC/C targets is achieved through recognition of destruction motifs, predominantly the destruction (D)-box3 and KEN (Lys-Glu-Asn)-box4. Although this process is known to involve a co-activator protein (either Cdc20 or Cdh1) together with core APC/C subunits1,2, the structural basis for substrate recognition and ubiquitylation is not understood. Here we investigate budding yeast APC/C using single-particle electron microscopy and determine a cryo-electron microscopy map of APC/C in complex with the Cdh1 co-activator protein (APC/CCdh1) bound to a D-box peptide at ∼10 Å resolution. We find that a combined catalytic and substrate-recognition module is located within the central cavity of the APC/C assembled from Cdh1, Apc10—a core APC/C subunit previously implicated in substrate recognition5,6,7—and the cullin domain of Apc2. Cdh1 and Apc10, identified from difference maps, create a co-receptor for the D-box following repositioning of Cdh1 towards Apc10. Using NMR spectroscopy we demonstrate specific D-box–Apc10 interactions, consistent with a role for Apc10 in directly contributing towards D-box recognition by the APC/CCdh1 complex. Our results rationalize the contribution of both co-activator and core APC/C subunits to D-box recognition8,9 and provide a structural framework for understanding mechanisms of substrate recognition and catalysis by the APC/C."
https://openalex.org/W2065725652,"Protein machineries that move along the DNA, such as DNA polymerases and helicases, will necessarily encounter other bound proteins interacting with specific sites. Using nanofabricated 'curtains' of labelled DNA, Finkelstein et al. set out to establish whether such bound proteins interfere with the activity of the bacterial DNA translocase RecBCD. They find that the enzyme is remarkably robust and can push proteins over non-specific sites for thousands of base pairs before they are displaced. Protein machineries that move along the DNA, such as DNA polymerases and helicases, will necessarily encounter other bound proteins interacting with specific sites. Using 'curtains' of labelled DNA, this study measured whether such bound proteins interfere with the activity of the bacterial DNA translocase RecBCD. The translocase is able to push the proteins over nonspecific sites for thousands of base pairs before they are displaced. In physiological settings, nucleic-acid translocases must act on substrates occupied by other proteins, and an increasingly appreciated role of translocases is to catalyse protein displacement from RNA and DNA1,2,3,4. However, little is known regarding the inevitable collisions that must occur, and the fate of protein obstacles and the mechanisms by which they are evicted from DNA remain unexplored. Here we sought to establish the mechanistic basis for protein displacement from DNA using RecBCD as a model system. Using nanofabricated curtains of DNA and multicolour single-molecule microscopy, we visualized collisions between a model translocase and different DNA-bound proteins in real time. We show that the DNA translocase RecBCD can disrupt core RNA polymerase, holoenzymes, stalled elongation complexes and transcribing RNA polymerases in either head-to-head or head-to-tail orientations, as well as EcoRIE111Q, lac repressor and even nucleosomes. RecBCD did not pause during collisions and often pushed proteins thousands of base pairs before evicting them from DNA. We conclude that RecBCD overwhelms obstacles through direct transduction of chemomechanical force with no need for specific protein–protein interactions, and that proteins can be removed from DNA through active disruption mechanisms that act on a transition state intermediate as they are pushed from one nonspecific site to the next."
https://openalex.org/W2026236991,"Cepheid variable stars have been important in the development of modern astrophysics through their use in establishing cosmic distances, but despite extensive research they retain some of their mysteries. One is the mass discrepancy problem, the fact that the masses of classical Cepheid supergiants calculated from pulsation theory (it is pulsation that causes their luminosity to vary) are smaller than the masses calculated from stellar evolution models. The ideal system in which to make an accurate mass determination would be a well-detached double-lined eclipsing binary in which one of the components was a classical Cepheid. Pietrzynski et al. report the discovery of just such a system in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The resultant mass determination, to a precision of one per cent, is in agreement with the mass as predicted by pulsation theory. Masses of pulsating classical Cepheid supergiants derived from stellar pulsation theory are smaller than the masses derived from stellar evolution theory. An independent determination for a classical Cepheid in a binary system is needed to determine which is correct. These authors report the discovery of a classical Cepheid in the Large Magellanic Cloud. They determine the mass to a precision of one per cent and show that it agrees with its pulsation mass. Stellar pulsation theory provides a means of determining the masses of pulsating classical Cepheid supergiants—it is the pulsation that causes their luminosity to vary. Such pulsational masses are found to be smaller than the masses derived from stellar evolution theory: this is the Cepheid mass discrepancy problem1,2, for which a solution is missing3,4,5. An independent, accurate dynamical mass determination for a classical Cepheid variable star (as opposed to type-II Cepheids, low-mass stars with a very different evolutionary history) in a binary system is needed in order to determine which is correct. The accuracy of previous efforts to establish a dynamical Cepheid mass from Galactic single-lined non-eclipsing binaries was typically about 15–30% (refs 6, 7), which is not good enough to resolve the mass discrepancy problem. In spite of many observational efforts8,9, no firm detection of a classical Cepheid in an eclipsing double-lined binary has hitherto been reported. Here we report the discovery of a classical Cepheid in a well detached, double-lined eclipsing binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud. We determine the mass to a precision of 1% and show that it agrees with its pulsation mass, providing strong evidence that pulsation theory correctly and precisely predicts the masses of classical Cepheids."

https://openalex.org/W2015231728,"Despite exciting progress in understanding the Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway in the germ line, less is known about this pathway in somatic cells. We showed previously that Piwi, a key component of the piRNA pathway in Drosophila, is regulated in somatic cells by Yb, a novel protein containing an RNA helicase-like motif and a Tudor-like domain. Yb is specifically expressed in gonadal somatic cells and regulates piwi in somatic niche cells to control germ line and somatic stem cell self-renewal. However, the molecular basis of the regulation remains elusive. Here, we report that Yb recruits Armitage (Armi), a putative RNA helicase involved in the piRNA pathway, to the Yb body, a cytoplasmic sphere to which Yb is exclusively localized. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that Yb forms a complex with Armi. In Yb mutants, Armi is dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, and Piwi fails to enter the nucleus and is rarely detectable in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, somatic piRNAs are drastically diminished, and soma-expressing transposons are desilenced. These observations indicate a crucial role of Yb and the Yb body in piRNA biogenesis, possibly by regulating the activity of Armi that controls the entry of Piwi into the nucleus for its function.

Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1776-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To investigate the unique aspect of piRNA biogenesis and function in somatic cells, we studied Yb, a gene that is specifically expressed in somatic cells in the Drosophila gonad and regulates piwi in somatic niche cells in controlling both germ line and somatic stem cell self-renewal (23King F.J. Lin H. Development. 1999; 126: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar, 24King F.J. Szakmary A. Cox D.N. Lin H. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Yb is so far the only gene known to regulate the coordinated self-renewing divisions of two different types of stem cells within an organ (23King F.J. Lin H. Development. 1999; 126: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar, 24King F.J. Szakmary A. Cox D.N. Lin H. Mol.

Biol. 2005; 15: 171-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It achieves this by regulating Piwi and Hedgehog expression in somatic niche cells. Piwi and Hedgehog then mediate two separate signaling pathways downstream of Yb to control the division of germ line and somatic stem cells (the two main constituent types of stem cells in the Drosophila ovary). Loss of Yb function eliminates germ line stem cells and reduces somatic stem cell division, whereas overexpression of Yb increases germ line stem cell number and causes somatic stem cell overproliferation. In addition to its stem cell function, Yb is required for follicle cell differentiation by interacting with the Notch group of cell-cell signaling genes (27Johnson E. Wayne S. Nagoshi R. Genetics. 1995; 140: 207-217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with its expression in all somatic cells in the ovary (26Szakmary A. Reedy M. Qi H. Lin H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanism by which Yb achieves its regulation of germ line and somatic stem cell division has also begun to be revealed. Yb encodes a protein with localized regions bearing similarity to DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicases and a Tudor domain (23King F.J. Lin H. Development. 1999; 126: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we discovered that Yb is localized to a novel cytoplasmic sphere of ∼1.5 μm in diameter, the Yb body, that is exclusively present in the somatic cells in the ovary and testis (26Szakmary A. Reedy M. Qi H. Lin H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because Yb is a Tudor domain-containing protein that genetically interacts with Piwi and frequently associates with RNA-rich spots in follicle cells (26Szakmary A. Reedy M. Qi H. Lin H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and because other Tudor domain-containing proteins are known to be involved in the piRNA pathway (28Shoji M. Tanaka T. Hosokawa M. Reuter M. Stark A. Kato Y. Kondoh G. Okawa K. Chujo T. Suzuki T. Hata K. Martin S.L. Noce T. Kuramochi-Miyagawa S. Nakano T. Sasaki H. Pillai R.S. Nakatsuji N. Chuma S. Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 775-787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), we examined the possible involvement of Yb in the piRNA pathway. Because Piwi is a nuclear protein but Yb is a cytoplasmic protein, we examined whether Yb regulates Piwi via other piRNA pathway components in the cytoplasm, such as Armitage (Armi), which is expressed in somatic cells. Among piRNA pathway components, Armi is a putative RNA helicase in the cytoplasm of both germ line and follicle cells in the Drosophila ovary (29Tomari Y. Du T. Haley B. Schwarz D.S. Bennett R. Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Theurkauf W.E. Zamore P.D. Cell. 2004; 116: 831-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). We noticed from the micrographs of Cook et al. (30Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Wu J. Theurkauf W.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) that, in follicle cells, Armi is localized to discrete spots that resemble the Yb body. Hence, we examined the potential colocalization and the relationship between Armi and Yb to explore the potential link between Yb and the piRNA pathway. Here, we report that Armi indeed localizes to the Yb body, where it is associated with Yb. In Yb mutants, Armi is mislocalized, and surprisingly, Piwi is drastically reduced in abundance and fails to enter the nucleus in somatic cells. Moreover, the biogenesis of piRNAs and endo-siRNAs in the somatic cells is severely disrupted, and transposons are desilenced. These observations indicate a crucial role of Yb and the Yb body in piRNA biogenesis. All strains were grown at 25 °C on standard Drosophila medium. The following fly strains were used. w1118 served as the WT strain. Yb72 was previously described as a Yb-null allele (23King F.J. Lin H. Development. 1999; 126: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar); 5×FLAG-Yb transgenic w1118 flies, carrying a fully functional FLAG-Yb gene (26Szakmary A. Reedy M. Qi H. Lin H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), were used in immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation. Ovaries were dissected, fixed, and stained as described previously (31Lin H. Yue L. Spradling A.C. Development. 1994; 120: 947-956PubMed Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence staining, the following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:300; Sigma-Aldrich), polyclonal rabbit anti-FLAG F7425 (1:500; Sigma-Aldrich), polyclonal rabbit anti-Armi-NT1 (1:500; a gift from W.

Lasko). Alexa Fluor 488- or 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and were used at 1:500 dilution. Immunofluorescently labeled samples were also counterstained with DAPI as described previously (31Lin H. Yue L. Spradling A.C. Development. 1994; 120: 947-956PubMed Google Scholar). Images were taken using a Leica TCS SP5 spectral confocal microscope in the sequential scanning mode and then processed using Photoshop (Adobe). The ovaries were dissected in ice-cold PBS and homogenized in MCB buffer (100 mm KOAc, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1× Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The ovarian lysates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed using mouse anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) or rabbit anti-Armi-NT1 antibody with protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with MCB buffer at 4 °C, eluted from the beads in 2× SDS sample buffer, and assayed by Western blot analysis. For Western blotting, the rabbit anti-Armi-NT1 and the monoclonal mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibodies were used at 1:5000 and 1:1000 dilutions, respectively. RNA was isolated from Drosophila ovaries, and quantification of the transposon transcripts by quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously (20Li C. Vagin V.V. Lee S. Xu J. Ma S. Xi H.

To prepare small RNA libraries, low-molecular-weight RNA was isolated from the adult ovaries of w1118 and the Yb72/Yb72 mutant using a microRNA isolation kit (Ambion). Small RNAs ranging in size between 16 and 29 nucleotides (nt) (below 2 S rRNA) were gel-purified, and small RNA libraries were prepared using a small RNA sample prep kit (Illumina) according to the alternative v1.5 protocol. The clones were sequenced using Genome Analyzer II. Only sequences perfectly matching the Drosophila melanogaster release 5 genome (excluding Uextra) were analyzed. Libraries were normalized using the total number of miRNAs to allow for cross-analysis between the mutant and control. After removal of abundant cellular noncoding RNA and miRNAs, we mapped 18–32-nt small RNAs to a subset of known piRNA clusters and to the complete collection of D. melanogaster transposable elements (Repbase) (33Jurka J. Kapitonov V.V. Pavlicek A. Klonowski P. Kohany O. Walichiewicz J. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2005; 110: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Over 22 million sequences were obtained for each library (WT and Yb mutant). The 3′-linker was clipped from the sequences, and the clipping rates for the WT and Yb mutant were ∼80 and ∼70%, respectively. The sequences ranging 18–32 nt in size were extracted. The sequences were mapped to the D. melanogaster release 5 genome (excluding Uextra) using perfect match criteria. Only genome-matching sequences were analyzed. Prior to any analysis, sequences that could be mapped to rRNA, tRNA, small nucleolar RNA, snRNA, and noncoding RNA (FlyBase annotation and UCSC RepeatMasker annotation) were removed. Considering that the noncoding RNA annotation is not completed so far, up to two mismatches were allowed with insertion/deletion included. After removal of cellular RNA contamination, we mapped small RNAs to annotated miRNA precursors in miRBase using perfect match criteria. After removal of miRNA sequences, the small RNAs were used for piRNA cluster and transposable element annotation analysis. The number of small RNA sequences obtained in each step is found in supplemental Table S1. Although both WT and Yb mutant samples underwent the same preparation procedures, sequencing depths varied between these two samples, which prevented direct comparison of small RNA levels between the two libraries. Because the global trend of the miRNA expression profile between those two libraries was similar (supplemental Table S2), we assumed that the miRNA pathway is unaffected in the Yb mutant and normalized both libraries to the level of total miRNAs. All calculations involved in piRNA cluster analysis and transposon annotation were based on the normalized libraries. To assess the effect of Yb mutation on piRNAs from individual clusters, we analyzed the expression of piRNAs from the following 17 known clusters: 15 piRNA clusters from Hannon and co-workers (21Malone C.D. Brennecke J. Dus M. Stark A. McCombie W.R. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Cell. 2009; 137: 522-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar), which produce the greatest number of piRNAs according to their data; one piRNA cluster (Traffic Jam) from Siomi and co-workers (19Saito K. Inagaki S. Mituyama T. Kawamura Y. Ono Y. Sakota E. Kotani H. Asai K. Siomi H. Siomi M.C. Nature. 2009; 461: 1296-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar); and one piRNA cluster (OSS2) located in ChrX (11088517–11095451) from Lai and co-workers (22Lau N.C. Robine N. Martin R. Chung W.J. Niki Y. Berezikov E. Lai E.C. Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1776-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These 17 piRNA clusters comprise 12 germ line cell-enriched, two intermediate, and three somatic cell-enriched clusters. To avoid the ambiguous assignment of small RNAs, we only consider the uniquely mapped small RNAs, i.e. those that can be perfectly mapped only to one position on the D. melanogaster release 5 genome. For transposable element analysis, only 23–28-nt small RNAs were selected and mapped to the complete collection of D. melanogaster transposable elements (Repbase) (33Jurka J. Kapitonov V.V. Pavlicek A. Klonowski P. Kohany O. Walichiewicz J. Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2005; 110: 462-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). The mapping allows for up to three mismatches without including internal insertions or deletions to account for the strain difference and variation occurrence within elements. To determine whether Armi and Yb are colocalized to the Yb body, we conducted immuno-colocalization experiments using WT flies carrying an eye color mutation (w1118) and a fully functional 5×FLAG-tagged Yb gene (26Szakmary A. Reedy M. Qi H. Lin H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Double labeling of ovaries from these transgenic flies with anti-FLAG and anti-Armi antibodies revealed that Armi not only was enriched in germ line cells as shown previously (30Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Wu J. Theurkauf W.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) but also colocalized with the Yb body in somatic cap cells and follicle cells (Fig. 1), as we suspected. The Armi-Yb double staining of the Yb body highlights the somatic cells in both germaria and egg chambers. Every Armi spot colocalizes with Yb, and no Armi spot exists outside the Yb body. In contrast to Armi, Piwi was localized to the nucleus in both germ line and somatic cells (supplemental Fig. 1), whereas Ago3 and Aub were enriched in the nuage of germ line cells but were not detectable in somatic cells (supplemental Fig. S1), as reported previously. None of them colocalized with Yb in somatic cells. The complete colocalization of Armi and Yb in ovarian somatic cells indicates that Yb might be involved in the somatic piRNA pathway via Armi as a close interactor. Although the same staining pattern of Armi in follicle cells was observed in an earlier study, it was dismissed as nonspecific labeling because the same staining pattern was detected in Armi1/Armi72.1 mutants (30Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Wu J. Theurkauf W.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This could be due to the fact that Armi1 and Armi72.1 are not protein-null alleles (30Cook H.A. Koppetsch B.S. Wu J. Theurkauf W.E. Cell. 2004; 116: 817-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). To verify the colocalization of Armi and Yb and to determine whether Armi is in a molecular complex with Yb, we used an anti-FLAG antibody to immunoprecipitate FLAG-Yb complexes from the ovarian lysate of FLAG-Yb transgenic w1118 flies, using nontransgenic w1118 flies as a negative control. Western blot analysis indicated that Armi was co-immunoprecipitated from the lysates of the transgenic flies but not from those of the control flies (Fig. 2A). Hence, Armi was associated with Yb. This result was confirmed by a reciprocal immunoprecipitation of the ovarian lysate from FLAG-Yb transgenic flies with anti-Armi antibody, which co-immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged Yb (Fig. 2B). These data verified the colocalization of Yb and Armi in the Yb body because Yb is not detectable outside the Yb body (26Szakmary A. Reedy M. Qi H. Lin H. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Moreover, these results demonstrate that Yb and Armi physically interact in the same molecular complex. This close interaction between Yb and Armi suggests that Yb is likely a component of the piRNA pathway and may be involved in piRNA biogenesis through interaction with Armi. To further examine the potential role of Yb in the piRNA pathway, we examined whether the expression and localization of the piRNA pathway proteins Armi, Piwi, Ago3, and Aub are affected in the Yb mutant background. In contrast to the distinct localization of Armi in the Yb body in the WT ovary (Fig. 3A), Armi was no longer localized to the Yb body in Yb72/Yb72 somatic cells but became evenly distributed in their cytoplasm, even though its germ line localization was unaffected (Fig. 3, B and C). Remarkably, Piwi localization was also drastically affected, specifically in Yb72/Yb72 somatic cells; it was lost from the nucleus and was not significantly above the background in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, D–F). Expectedly, Ago3 and Aub were still not expressed in the soma, and no detectable change was observed for their staining pattern in the germ line (Fig. 3, G–L). These data suggest that the Yb protein is required for localization of Armi as well as the localization and expression and/or stability of Piwi, specifically in ovarian somatic cells. To directly assess the impact of Yb mutation on the piRNA pathway, we sequenced small RNA libraries prepared from an equal quantity of WT (w1118) and Yb72/Yb72 mutant ovaries (supplemental Table S1). The Yb mutant ovaries showed a decrease in the abundance of 26–27-nt piRNAs that were enriched in Piwi-associated piRNAs, which are expressed in both germ line and somatic cells (Fig. 4A) (34Brennecke J. Alexei A. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 1089-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). However, the levels of 23–24-nt piRNAs that were enriched in Aub/Ago3-bound piRNAs, which are expressed only in the germ line, were unchanged. Mapping of the small RNAs to known piRNA clusters or retrotransposons (19Saito K. Inagaki S. Mituyama T. Kawamura Y. Ono Y. Sakota E. Kotani H. Asai K. Siomi H. Siomi M.C.

These results suggest that only Piwi-associated somatic piRNAs are affected in the mutant. For example, the flamenco locus is known to generate predominately Piwi-associated piRNAs that are somatically expressed to regulate retrotransposons (34Brennecke J. Alexei A. Aravin A.A. Stark A. Dus M. Kellis M. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Cell. 2007; 128: 1089-1103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). In Yb mutants, small RNAs mapped to this locus were decreased by >38.4-fold (Figs. 4, B and D, and 5C). However, the flamenco small RNAs that remained in the mutant still showed a bias toward U at the first position (Fig. 5A), which is characteristic of piRNAs. Moreover, the peak of these piRNAs shifted from 26 to 25 nt (Fig. 5B), suggesting the depletion of longer Piwi-associated somatic piRNAs in the mutant and the relative “enrichment” of shorter germ line Aub/Ago3-associated piRNAs in the remaining pool. Together, these results suggest that Yb is essential for the expression of Piwi-associated somatic piRNAs.FIGURE 5Yb is involved in the biogenesis of flamenco-derived piRNAs and endo-siRNAs.

Twenty sedentary men were assessed when consuming a standardized, nutritionally balanced diet (control) and after 7 d of consuming a diet comprising 74% kcal from fat. Efficiency was measured during a standardized exercise task, and cognition was assessed using a computerized assessment battery. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial function was measured using (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The diet increased mean ± se plasma free fatty acids by 44% (0.32±0.03 vs. 0.46±0.05 mM; P<0.05) and decreased whole-body efficiency by 3% (21±1 vs. 18±1%; P<0.05), although muscle uncoupling protein (UCP3) content and maximal mitochondrial function were unchanged. High-fat diet consumption also increased subjects' simple reaction times (P<0.01) and decreased power of attention (P<0.01). Thus, we have shown that a high-fat diet blunts whole-body efficiency and cognition in sedentary men. We suggest that this effect may be due to increased respiratory uncoupling."
https://openalex.org/W2063798785,"The long pentraxin 3 (PTX3), serum amyloid P component (SAP), and C-reactive protein belong to the pentraxin family of pattern recognition molecules involved in tissue homeostasis and innate immunity. They interact with C1q from the classical complement pathway. Whether this also occurs via the analogous mannose-binding lectin (MBL) from the lectin complement pathway is unknown. Thus, we investigated the possible interaction between MBL and the pentraxins. We report that MBL bound PTX3 and SAP partly via its collagen-like domain but not C-reactive protein. MBL-PTX3 complex formation resulted in recruitment of C1q, but this was not seen for the MBL-SAP complex. However, both MBL-PTX3 and MBL-SAP complexes enhanced C4 and C3 deposition and opsonophagocytosis of Candida albicans by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Interaction between MBL and PTX3 led to communication between the lectin and classical complement pathways via recruitment of C1q, whereas SAP-enhanced complement activation occurs via a hitherto unknown mechanism. Taken together, MBL-pentraxin heterocomplexes trigger cross-activation of the complement system."
https://openalex.org/W2106131106,"β-N-Acetyl-d-hexosaminidase has been postulated to have a specialized function. However, the structural basis of this specialization is not yet established. OfHex1, the enzyme from the Asian corn borer Ostrinia furnacalis (one of the most destructive pests) has previously been reported to function merely in chitin degradation. Here the vital role of OfHex1 during the pupation of O. furnacalis was revealed by RNA interference, and the crystal structures of OfHex1 and OfHex1 complexed with TMG-chitotriomycin were determined at 2.1 Å. The mechanism of selective inhibition by TMG-chitotriomycin was related to the existence of the +1 subsite at the active pocket of OfHex1 and a key residue, Trp490, at this site. Mutation of Trp490 to Ala led to a 2,277-fold decrease in sensitivity toward TMG-chitotriomycin as well as an 18-fold decrease in binding affinity for the substrate (GlcNAc)2. Although the overall topology of the catalytic domain of OfHex1 shows a high similarity with the human and bacterial enzymes, OfHex1 is distinguished from these enzymes by large conformational changes linked to an “open-close” mechanism at the entrance of the active site, which is characterized by the “lid” residue, Trp448. Mutation of Trp448 to Ala or Phe resulted in a more than 1,000-fold loss in enzyme activity, due mainly to the effect on kcat. The current work has increased our understanding of the structure-function relationship of OfHex1, shedding light on the structural basis that accounts for the specialized function of β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidase as well as making the development of species-specific pesticides a likely reality. β-N-Acetyl-d-hexosaminidase has been postulated to have a specialized function.

Pavesi G. Horner D.S. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 214Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been postulated to have specialized physiological functions, including post-translational modification of N-glycans, degradation of glycoconjugates, and egg-sperm recognition (1Intra J. Pavesi G. Horner D.S. BMC Evol. Biol. 2008; 8: 214Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The structural basis for these specialized functions is still unclear. It is interesting to note that insects have evolved to have more than one β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidase, as revealed by genomic analysis of various insects, including Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Phthiraptera, and Hemiptera. The activities of insect β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidases are not restricted to chitin degradation but are also associated with post-translational modification of N-glycans, degradation of glycoconjugates, and egg-sperm recognition, suggesting that these enzymes have rather versatile physiological functions in the growth and development of insects (2Yang Q. Liu T. Liu F. Qu M. Qian X. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 5690-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Some of these physiological functions may overlap with those of the same enzymes found in higher organisms. Mammal lysosomal β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidases are mainly responsible for glycoconjugate degradation in lysosome (3Mahuran D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1455: 105-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Likewise, β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidases from the insects Bombyx mori (4Okada T. Ishiyama S. Sezutsu H. Usami A. Tamura T. Mita K. Fujiyama K. Seki T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2007; 71: 1626-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and Spodoptera frugiperda (5Aumiller J.J. Hollister J.R. Jarvis D.L. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 47: 571-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have broad substrate specificity ranging from N-glycans to chitooligosaccharides, suggesting that they have the same function as their mammal counterparts. Mammal β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidases have been shown to be important for egg-sperm recognition (6Miranda P.V. González-Echeverría F. Blaquier J.A. Mahuran D.J. Tezón J.G. Mol. Hum.

Similarly, the enzymes from D. melanogaster (11Léonard R. Rendic D. Rabouille C. Wilson I.B. Préat T. Altmann F. J. Biol.

Comparative analysis of β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidase genes in the coleopteran, Tribolium castaneum, has provided molecular and biological evidence to support the hypothesis that each of the four TcNAGs among a total of seven β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidases has an essential and specific function in chitin degradation and/or N-glycan modification during development (13Hogenkamp D.G. Arakane Y. Kramer K.J. Muthukrishnan S. Beeman R.W. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 478-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, it is interesting to know how these enzymes could carry out their specialized functions in terms of their structural features. Seven crystal structures of GH20 β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidases have been obtained, including two human and five bacterial enzymes.

Because O. furnacalis is a destructive and persistent pest in the Asian and pan-Pacific regions, a greater understanding of the structure-function relationship of OfHex1 would enable the development of a more species-specific pesticide. O. furnacalis was reared on an artificial diet. To analyze the temporal transcriptional pattern of OfHEX1 (encoding OfHex1, DQ887769), total RNAs were extracted from the entire insect at the fourth instar larval, fifth instar larval, prepupal, pupal, and adult stages using RNAiso reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). To analyze the transcriptional levels of OfHEX1 in different tissues, total RNAs were extracted from the integument and alimentary tract of the larva and subjected to RT-PCR using the PrimeScript RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa). The resulting cDNA obtained was subjected to real-time PCR using the OfHEX1-specific primers, 5′-TATGGGCATCCAGGCAGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGAGAGCCCCGTTGTTGT-3′ (reverse), and the OfRpS3 (encoding ribosomal protein S3, EU275206, as an internal reference)-specific primers, 5′-AGCGTTTCAACATCCCTGAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACACCATAGCAGGCACGA-3′ (reverse). Real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa) and Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia). For double-stranded RNA synthesis, a 246-bp fragment between nucleotides 151 and 356 in OfHEX1 was selected as template. Two primers, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGCGTCAAGCTGAAGAAGAACG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGCGGCCTCCATCAGGT-3′ (reverse), each with a T7 RNA promoter sequence (underlined bases) flanking the 5′-end were used in the in vitro transcription performed with MEGAscript RNAi Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 3 μg of OfHEX1 dsRNA (dsOfHEX1) was injected into the penultimate abdominal segment of day 2–5 instar larvae using a 10-μl syringe. Larvae injected with 3 μg of dsRNA of green fluorescent protein (dsGFP) were used as control. Injection was carried out for 100 individual larvae in each group. Two days after injection, three larvae were randomly selected for total RNA extraction. The remaining larvae were allowed to develop into the pupal stage. Three of these from the group injected with dsOfHEX1 that showed abnormal phenotypes and three from the control group were selected for transcriptional analysis of OfHEX1 by real-time PCR as described above. Expression and purification of OfHex1 were carried out as described previously (24Liu T. Liu F. Yang Q. Yang J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 68: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gene encoding OfHex1 was amplified from the vector CTB557-2-1 (kept in our laboratory) by PCR using forward primer 5′-GCTTACGTAGAATTCGAGGACGTAGTATGGCGCTGGT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTAATTCGCGGCCGCTTAATGATGATGATGATGATGCGAGTAACAGTACCCCTC-3′. The expressed OfHex1 contained a His6 tag at the C terminus. Single amino acid mutations were made by PCR using the following primer pairs: 5′-GCTTGTTCTCCTTACATCGGATGGCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GATGTAAGGAGAACAAGCGTTGTTACCAGC-3′ (reverse) for W490A; 5′-GGTGAGCCCCCATGCGGTCAGCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGCATGGGGGCTCACCGCAGTATGATTTCC-3′ (reverse) for V327G; 5′-CCAAGTAGCTACCACCGGCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGGTAGCTACTTGGATAATG-3′ (reverse) for W448A; 5′-CCAAGTATTTACCACCGGCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGGTAAATACTTGGATAATG-3′ (reverse) for W448F; 5′-GCGCCCCCATGCGGTCAGCTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCGCATGGGGGCGCCACGCAG-3′ (reverse) for E328A; and 5′-CAGCCCCCATGCGGTCAGCTCA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCGCATGGGGGCTGCACGCAG-3′ (reverse) for E328Q. The PCR products were cloned into pPIC9 (Invitrogen) and transformed into Pichia pastoris GS115 by electroporation. Cells were cultured in BMMY broth (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 1% methanol, 1.34% yeast nitrogen base, and 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 6.0)) for 144 h, and methanol (1% of the total volume) was added every 24 h. Wild-type and mutant OfHex1 were purified from the culture supernatant by ammonium sulfate precipitation (65% saturation), affinity chromatography on an IMAC Sepharose High Performance column (GE Healthcare) followed by anion exchange chromatography on a Q Sepharose high performance column (GE Healthcare) (24Liu T. Liu F. Yang Q. Yang J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 68: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics of wild-type and mutant OfHex1 were assayed using 4-methylumbelliferone-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (4MU-β-GlcNAc) (Sigma) as substrate. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 1–16 μm 4MU-β-GlcNAc and an appropriate amount of enzyme in Britton-Robinson's wide range buffer. After incubating at 25 °C for 5 min, 100 μl of 0.5 m glycine-NaOH (pH 10.3) was added to the sample to stop the reaction, and the fluorescence produced by the released 4-methylumbelliferone was quantified by a spectrofluorometer (Thermo Scientific Varioskan Flash, Thermo) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 405 nm, respectively. Steady-state kinetics of wild type and of V327G and W490A mutants were also assayed using chitobiose ((GlcNAc)2; Sigma) as substrate. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 33–100 μm (GlcNAc)2 and 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). After incubating at 25 °C for 10 min, the hydrolytic products were analyzed by HPLC using TSKgel Amide-80 column (4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh) on the Agilent 1200 HPLC system (Agilent) (2Yang Q. Liu T. Liu F. Qu M. Qian X. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 5690-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Km and kcat values of each enzyme were calculated by linear regression via Lineweaver-Burk plots. The inhibition constants (Ki) were determined by steady-state kinetics using the same conditions, but the samples contained different concentrations of inhibitors. The Ki values were calculated by linear regression of data in Dixon plots. Both native and inhibitor-bound OfHex1 were crystallized in the space group P3221 within 2 weeks by vapor diffusion at 4 °C. The mother liquor of the native protein consisted of 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 200 mm MgCl2, and 30% PEG 400. The crystal of OfHex1 in complex with TMG-chitotriomycin was obtained by co-crystallization of the native protein with a 5-fold excess of TMG-chitotriomycin in the same mother liquor as that of native OfHex1, except at pH 7.5. Hanging drops were set up by mixing an aliquot of enzyme (7 mg/ml) with an equal amount of the mother liquor. Diffraction data were collected at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility, BL-17U. All diffraction data were processed using the HKL2000 package (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The structures of free OfHex1 and OfHex1-TMG-chitotriomycin complex were solved by molecular replacement with MolRep (26Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl.

Open table in a new tab The expression profile of OfHEX1 was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Expression of OfHEX1 was up-regulated before each molting stage during development of the late fourth instar larva (4L), late fifth instar larva (5L5), prepupa (PP), and late pupa (P3) (Fig. 1A). The expression level of OfHex1 reached its peak at the fifth instar day 5 and prepupa stages, which is about 10 times higher than that of fifth instar day 3 larva (5L3 in Fig. 1). This demonstrated that transcription of OfHEX1 was greatly up-regulated during pupation of O. furnacalis. To determine whether transcription of OfHEX1 is tissue-specific, larvae of two representative developmental stages (fifth instar days 3 and 5) were selected, and the levels of OfHEX1 transcript in the integument and alimentary tracts were measured. Larvae at the fifth instar day 3 stage showed a considerable increase in body weight at a rate of 0.03 g/day, whereas those at the fifth instar day 5 stage had already stopped feeding and began to spin and prepare to pupate. As shown in Fig. 1B, the expression levels of OfHEX1 in the integument and alimentary tract were similar at the fifth instar day 3 stage. However, at the fifth instar day 5 stage, the expression level of OfHEX1 in the integument was up-regulated more than 3-fold but remained unchanged in the alimentary tract. This demonstrated that the up-regulation of OfHEX1 transcription was specific to the integument during the pupation of O. furnacalis. Based on the data of temporal and spatial transcriptional patterns of OfHEX1, we proposed that this gene is involved in the pupation of O. furnacalis. To validate this proposal, gene-specific dsRNA was injected into fifth instar day 2 larvae of O. furnacalis to suppress the transcription of OfHEX1. Before pupation, most of the larvae injected with OfHEX1 survived without any visible changes in phenotype and appeared similar to those injected with dsGFP. At the pupation stage, however, 20% of the dsOfHEX1-injected larvae showed abnormal phenotypes that were absent in dsGFP-injected larvae and died 1 or 2 days after pupation. The pupation process was obviously affected at different times (Fig. 1C). Some abnormal phenotypes manifested only as a small opening at the back without further molting while the whole body still remained in the larval stage, but the white new cuticle was already visible at the opening (Fig. 1C, first abnormal sample). Some abnormal larvae shed half of their old cuticles, with the head capsules already moved to the middle of the body. The head and thorax became tanned, but the abdomen remained in the larval form (Fig. 1C, second abnormal sample). Other larvae with abnormal phenotypes shed most of the old cuticles and appeared as nascent pupae, but part of the old black cuticle with the head capsule still tightly adhered to the body and could not molt completely (Fig. 1C, third abnormal sample). Thus, it appeared that all of the O. furnacalis larvae with abnormal phenotypes failed to shed their old cuticles completely before new ones started to form underneath. Down-regulation of OfHEX1 in dsOfHEX1-injected O. furnacalis was observed not only in the larvae after 2 days of injection but also in the larvae at the emergence of the abnormal phenotype (Fig. 1D). The result demonstrated that OfHex1 plays a vital role in the degradation of old cuticle during the pupation stage of O. furnacalis. TcNAG1, a homolog of OfHEX1 from T. castaneum, has also been validated by RNAi to play a role in cuticular chitin turnover during insect metamorphosis (13Hogenkamp D.G. Arakane Y. Kramer K.J. Muthukrishnan S. Beeman R.W. Insect. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 478-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). dsTcNAG1-injected insects failed to completely shed their old cuticles and finally died. OfHex1 was expressed as a secretory enzyme in P. pastoris and purified as described previously (24Liu T. Liu F. Yang Q. Yang J. Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 68: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the free OfHex1 reveals a homodimeric enzyme with the two monomers in the adjacent asymmetry units reconstructed by a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis adhering to each other in a side-by-side fashion. Each monomer is N-glycosylated at Asn164 and Asn375. All of the 12 cysteine residues of each monomer contribute to the intradisulfide bonds (Cys31–Cys59, Cys36–Cys55, Cys316–Cys373, Cys326–Cys331, Cys478–Cys491, and Cys585–Cys592). The interface between two monomers is formed mainly by loop regions of the (β/α)8-barrel with a buried area of ∼2,853 Å2/monomer, 2 times bigger than that of human dimeric HexB (1,612 Å2) or HexA (1,587 Å2) (Fig. 2A). Numerous hydrophobic bonds and five salt bridges at the dimer interface were revealed by PISA (available on the European Bioinformatics Institute Web site). Each monomer of OfHex1 consists of a typical two-domain fold similar to those of the human (14Mark B.L. Mahuran D.J. Cherney M.M. Zhao D. Knapp S. James M.N. J. Mol.

Besides the conserved six-stranded antiparallel β-sheets, there is one extra antiparallel β-strand and α-helix on the N terminus (residues 23–61, in orange) of OfHex1 (Fig. 2A). These extra segments appear to be important for dimerization through interaction with domain II of the adjacent monomer via residues 264–273, 306, 309, and 310. Domain II of OfHex1 is formed by residues 208–594, which contains the active pocket within the classical (β/α)8-barrel segments. Like all known GH20 β-N-acetyl-d-hexosaminidases, OfHex1 also does not have helices α5 and α7. Unlike the other enzymes, OfHex1 contains an extended loop (L361–366, residues 361–366) instead of the β4 strand. Because two catalytic residues, Asp367 and Glu368, are located at the end of L361–366, this change may bring the catalytic residues into closer proximity with the substrate. Two other loops, residues 314–335 (L314–335 in pink) and residues 478–496 (L478–496 in green), are rigid but appear functional (Fig. 2, A and B). L314"

https://openalex.org/W2008625770,"Gene expression within the context of eukaryotic chromatin is regulated by enzymes that catalyze histone lysine methylation. Histone lysine methyltransferases that have been identified to date possess the evolutionarily conserved SET or Dot1-like domains. We previously reported the identification of a new multi-subunit histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase lacking homology to the SET or Dot1 family of histone lysine methyltransferases. This enzymatic activity requires a complex that includes WRAD (WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30), a complex that is part of the MLL1 (mixed lineage leukemia protein-1) core complex but that also exists independently of MLL1 in the cell. Here, we report that the minimal complex required for WRAD enzymatic activity includes WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L and that DPY-30, although not required for enzymatic activity, increases the histone substrate specificity of the WRAD complex. We also show that WRAD requires zinc for catalytic activity, displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and is inhibited by S-adenosyl-homocysteine. In addition, we demonstrate that WRAD preferentially methylates lysine 4 of histone H3 within the context of the H3/H4 tetramer but does not methylate nucleosomal histone H3 on its own. In contrast, we find that MLL1 and WRAD are required for nucleosomal histone H3 methylation, and we provide evidence suggesting that each plays distinct structural and catalytic roles in the recognition and methylation of a nucleosome substrate.

Histone lysine methylation regulates gene expression by recruiting proteins that stabilize or remodel distinct chromatin states (1Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bernstein B.E. Karabetsou N. Morillon A.

Lysine residues can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated with distinct functional consequences, increasing the combinatorial signaling potential of lysine methylation (4Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R.

Although it has become increasingly clear that regulation of the degree of lysine methylation plays a functionally significant role in eukaryotic gene regulation, the molecular mechanisms involved are only beginning to be understood. Recent data suggest several models for the regulation of the degree of methylation by histone lysine methyltransferases. One model suggests that multiple methylation is achieved by distinct histone lysine methyltransferases that have evolved to catalyze the addition of one, two, or three methyl groups to a single lysine side chain. In this model, the addition of each methyl group is sequentially catalyzed by a distinct enzyme and is supported by the existence of several SET domain enzymes that differ in their abilities to use mono- or dimethyllysine as a substrate for further methylation (6Cheng X. Collins R.E. Zhang X. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 267-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), a phenomenon known as “product specificity” (7Zhang X. Yang Z. Khan S.I. Horton J.R. Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Cheng X. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 177-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In contrast, an alternative model suggests that multiple lysine methylation may be achieved by allosteric control of a single SET domain enzyme. In the allosteric model, the degree of lysine methylation is controlled by proteins that interact with and alter the conformation of the catalytic SET domain, altering its ability to catalyze the addition of each methyl group to a lysine side chain. The regulation of the trimethylation activity of the ESET/SETDB1 protein by interaction with the mAM protein (8Wang H. An W. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Chatton B. Tempst P. Roeder R.G.

Another often cited example for allosteric control of multiple lysine methylation is the SET1 family of HMTases.

We recently reported that the intrinsic activity of an isolated MLL1 SET domain is indeed that of an H3K4 monomethyltransferase (43Patel A. Dharmarajan V. Vought V.E. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24242-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we discovered that WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY-30 form a subcomplex (called “WRAD”) that possesses an H3K4 methyltransferase activity that is independent of the MLL1 SET domain (26Cosgrove M.S. Patel A. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 1832-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 43Patel A. Dharmarajan V. Vought V.E. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24242-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In addition, contrary to the predictions of the allosteric model for multiple lysine methylation, we demonstrated that WRAD catalyzes H3K4 dimethylation within the context of the MLL1 core complex, providing the first example of a sequential multiple lysine methylation system (43Patel A. Dharmarajan V. Vought V.E. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24242-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Because the components of the WRAD complex lack homology to known S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase folds, relatively little is understood about how this novel enzyme works. Here we further characterize the enzymatic activity and substrate specificity of WRAD in isolation and in the presence of MLL1. A construct of human MLL1 consisting of amino acid residues 3745–3969 (MLL3745) as well as full-length human proteins WDR5, RbBP5, Ash2L, and DPY30 were individually expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (43Patel A.

The WRAD or MWRAD complexes were created by mixing equimolar amounts of each recombinant component. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation was used to assess complex formation as described below. Histones were expressed, purified, refolded, and reconstituted into nucleosomes using the small scale reconstitution procedure as described by Dyer et al. (45Dyer P.N. Edayathumangalam R.S. White C.L. Bao Y. Chakravarthy S. Muthurajan U.M. Luger K.

(46Flaus A. Rencurel C. Ferreira H. Wiechens N. Owen-Hughes T. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation experiments were carried out using a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLabTM XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an eight-hole An-50 Ti analytical rotor. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out at 10 °C and 50,000 rpm (200,000 × g) using 3-mm two-sector charcoal-filled Epon centerpieces with quartz windows. For each sample, 300 scans were collected with the time interval between scans set to 0. Protein samples in 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP, and 1 μm ZnCl2 were run at various concentrations as described under “Results.” Sedimentation boundaries were analyzed by the continuous distribution (c(s)) method using the program SEDFIT (47Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3065) Google Scholar). The program SEDNTERP version 1.09 (48Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.

Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 19-125Google Scholar) was used to correct the experimental S value (s) to standard conditions at 20 °C in water (S20,w) and to calculate the partial specific volume of each protein. Histone methyltransferase activity assays were carried out by combining 5 μg of chicken core histones (Millipore) and 1 μCi of [3H]methyl S-adenosylmethionine ([3H]AdoMet; MP Biomedicals) in the presence of the WRA(D) enzyme at a final concentration of 4.3 μm. The reaction buffer contained 50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol. The reactions were incubated at 15 °C for 8 h and quenched by dilution with 5× SDS loading buffer. The reactions were separated by 18% Tris-glycine PAGE or 4–12% Bis-Tris PAGE (Invitrogen). The gels were soaked in autoradiography enhancer solution (ENLIGHTNING; PerkinElmer Life Science) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to film at −80 °C overnight or for up to 4 days. For assays comparing the enzymatic activity of WRAD with full-length unmodified or monomethylated recombinant Xenopus laevis histone H3 (Active Motif®), 4 μg of histone H3 was incubated with 1 μCi of [3H]AdoMet in the presence of the WRA(D) enzyme at a final concentration of 4.3 μm. The reactions were processed as described above. Enzymatic reactions (20 μl) were initiated by the addition of enzyme (1–17 μm) to reaction mixtures containing a fixed concentration of histone H3 peptide (residues 1–20) and variable concentrations of [3H]AdoMet (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; specific activity, 12 μCi/mm) or fixed [3H]AdoMet concentrations and variable concentrations of histone H3 peptide in assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 200 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol). The reactions were incubated at 15 °C for 4 h and then stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 5× SDS loading buffer. Control time course experiments showed that reactions were still linear after 4 h with various substrate and coenzyme combinations. Quenched reactions were separated by 4–12% Bis-Tris PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. Peptide bands were excised from the gel and dissolved in 750 μl of SolvableTM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 50 °C for 3 h. The extracted peptide solution was mixed with 5 ml of scintillation mixture (ULTIMA GOLD XR; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and counted using a Beckman Coulter LS6500 scintillation counter. Initial rates were plotted as a function of the variable substrate and fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 1) using the nonlinear least squares regression analysis in SigmaPlot. To determine the apparent inhibition constant (Ki) for S-adenosyl-homocysteine (AdoHyc), enzymatic assays were conducted by incubating fixed concentrations of [3H]AdoMet (25 μm), histone H3 peptide (500 μm), and WRAD (4.3 μm) with variable concentrations of AdoHyc (0–250 μm). The reactions were allowed to proceed for 4 h, quenched with SDS loading buffer, and separated by PAGE. Peptide bands were excised, dissolved with Solvable, and counted by LSC as described above. The inhibition curve was fitted to Equation 2 using SigmaPlot software. v0=Vmax[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 1) v0=Vmax[S]/(Km(1+[I]/Ki)+[S])(Eq. 2) Enzymatic assays with reconstituted nucleosomes were carried out as described above. The reactions were quenched by the addition of SDS loading buffer after 8 h and resolved by 18% Tris-glycine PAGE. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with antibodies specific for H3K4 monomethyllysine (1:500 dilution; Abcam catalogue number ab8895), dimethyllysine (1:1000 dilution, Abcam catalogue number ab32356), or trimethyllysine (1:500 dilution, Active Motif catalogue number 39160). We previously demonstrated that the isolated human WRAD complex monomethylates but does not dimethylate histone H3 peptides (residues 1–20) at lysine 4 (43Patel A. Dharmarajan V. Vought V.E. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24242-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, we demonstrated that WRAD acquires the ability to monomethylate histone peptides that are unmethylated or monomethylated at lysine 4 when assembled with a catalytically inactive variant of the MLL1 SET domain (43Patel A. Dharmarajan V. Vought V.E. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24242-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These results suggest that WRAD is a one-carbon methyl transfer enzyme that is capable of transferring one methyl group to histone H3 on its own or to a previously monomethylated H3K4 substrate but only when in complex with MLL1. To better understand the substrate specificity of the isolated WRAD complex under our standard in vitro assay conditions, we characterized the methylation activity of recombinant human WRAD with different histone substrates. When purified, chicken core histones and [3H]AdoMet are incubated in the presence of WRAD, [3H]methyl is incorporated into histone H3 but not histones H2A, H2B, H4, or H1 (Fig. 1A). To identify lysine residues methylated by WRAD, we compared activity among recombinant full-length X. laevis histone H3 proteins that were unmethylated or chemically modified to introduce a monomethyllysine analogue at lysine 4 (Active Motif®). The results show that unmethylated histone H3 is a substrate for methylation by WRAD (Fig. 1B, lane 1) but not histone H3 previously monomethylated at lysine 4 (Fig. 1B, lane 2). To determine whether the chemically modified form of histone H3 can be dimethylated, we added to WRAD the wild-type MLL1 SET domain construct (residues 3745–3969 (MLL3745)) to form the fully assembled MLL1 core complex, which we previously demonstrated to be required for dimethylation of H3K4 (43Patel A. Dharmarajan V. Vought V.E. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24242-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In these assays, methylation of monomethylated histone H3 is readily observed (Fig. 1C, lane 2), indicating that the monomethyllysine analogue is an adequate mimic of the H3K4 monomethylated state. These results indicate that histone H3 is the preferred substrate for isolated human WRAD, which, in the absence of MLL1, preferentially monomethylates lysine 4. These results are in agreement with our previous demonstration that the isolated WRAD complex monomethylates H3 peptides in an H3K4-dependent manner (43Patel A. Dharmarajan V. Vought V.E. Cosgrove M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 24242-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We next compared the enzymatic activity of WRAD using as substrates recombinant X. laevis histone H3 in the context of free histone H3, the dialyzed histone octamer (which under the assayed conditions dissociates into an H3/H4 tetramer and two H2B/H2A dimers (49Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar)), and a reconstituted nucleosome. The results show that free recombinant H3 and the H3/H4 tetramer are methylated by WRAD (Fig. 1D, lanes 1 and 2), with the H3/H4 tetramer showing greater methylation. In contrast, reconstituted nucleosomes are not a substrate for WRAD (Fig. 1D, lane 3). It should be noted that the lack of activity with nucleosomes does not appear to be due to inhibition by free DNA, because the addition of a stoichiometric equivalent of free DNA to assays with the histone octamer does not significantly affect methylation by WRAD (data not shown). These results indicate that histone H3 within the context of the histone H3/H4 tetramer is the preferred substrate for WRAD when recombinant histones are used as a substrate. To identify the minimal complex required for methylation by WRAD, we compared activity among the individual components and all possible binary and ternary complexes using purified chicken core histones as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 2A, no activity is observed when the assays are conducted with the individual components of the WRAD complex (lanes 1–4) or with any of the binary complexes (lanes 5–7 and 13–15), similar to that observed in the absence of enzyme (lane 16). Enzymatic activity is observed only with WRA and WRAD complexes (lanes 8 and 9, respectively) but not with any of the other ternary complexes (lanes 10–12). WRAD activity depends on the dose of the enzyme, as indicated by the nearly linear dependence of activity on enzyme concentration (Fig. 2B). The addition of DPY-30 to the WRA subcomplex results in a 38% increase in the slope of the dose response curve (Fig. 2B), suggesting that DPY-30 may function to enhance the activity of WRAD. The enhanced activity in the presence of DPY-30 may be due in part to stabilization of the complex, because sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation experiments show that the WRAD complex is slightly more stable upon dilution than the WRA complex (Fig. 2C). For example, the WRAD complex represents 71% (4.1 s), 69% (4.0 s), and 63% (3.9 s) of all species in the sample run at concentrations of 2.2, 1.1, and 0.6 μm, respectively (Fig. 2C, upper panel). In contrast, in the absence of DPY-30, the WRA subcomplex represents 67% (4.0 s), 65% (3.8 s), and 53% (3.5 s) of all species at the same concentrations, respectively (Fig. 2C, lower panel). DPY-30 promotes complex formation at each protein concentration. Taken together, these results indicate that WDR5, RbBP5, and Ash2L form the minimal complex required for methylation of histone H3 and that DPY-30 functions to enhance complex stability and enzymatic activity. To determine apparent steady-state kinetic parameters for WRA and WRAD complexes, we performed enzymatic reactions with variable amounts of AdoMet at a constant concentration of histone H3 peptide (residues 1–20). Michaelis-Menten kinetics were observed for both WRA and WRAD complexes (Fig. 3). Nonlinear least square regression fitting of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation shows that AdoMet binds to WRAD and WRA in enzymatic reactions with relatively similar apparent Km values of 8 and 14 μm, respectively (Fig. 3A and Table 1). In contrast, when the histone H3 peptide is the variable substrate, the apparent Km value for histone H3 decreases ∼7-fold from 2.4 to 0.34 mm when DPY-30 is added to the complex (Fig. 3B and Table 1). These data suggest that DPY-30 functions to increase the specificity of WRAD for histone H3, as reflected by the greater increase in the apparent specificity constant (kcat/Km) for histone H3 (3-fold) compared with that of AdoMet (1.6-fold) when DPY-30 is added to the complex (Table 1).TABLE 1Summary of apparent kinetic parameters for WRA and WRAD complexesEnzymeKmAdoMetKmH3 peptideKcatAdoMetKcatH3 peptideKcat/KmAdoMetKcat/KmH3 peptideμmμm×10−4 h−1×10−4 h−1×10−4 μm−1 h−1×10−4 μm−1 h−1WRA13.7 ± 3.72382 ± 26920701.50.03WRAD7.9 ± 1.7338 ± 5418302.30.09"

MeHg-induced selenium deficiency leads to failure of the recoding of a UGA codon for selenocysteine and results in degradation of the major antioxidant selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1) mRNA by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a cellular mechanism that detects the premature termination codon (PTC) located 5′-upstream of the last exon-exon junction and degrades PTC-containing mRNAs. In contrast, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), another antioxidant selenoenzyme of the thioredoxin system, was likely skipped by NMD because of a UGA codon in the last exon. However, TrxR1 activity was decreased despite mRNA up-regulation, which was probably due to the synthesis of aberrant TrxR1 protein without selenocysteine.

We were interested in identifying β-thymosin interactors and determining their importance in β-thymosins signaling in human vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We performed pulldown experiments with biotinylated thymosin β-4 (Tβ4) in comparison to neutravidin beads alone and used mass spectrometric analysis to identify differentially interacting proteins. By this method, we identified F1-F0 ATP synthase, a known target of antiangiogenic angiostatin. By surface plasmon resonance, we determined for Tβ4 binding to the β subunit of ATP synthase a K(D) of 12 nM. Blocking antibodies and antagonists (oligomycin, IC(50) ∼1.8 μM; piceatannol, IC(50) ∼1.05 μM; and angiostatin, IC(50) ∼2.9 μg/ml) of ATP synthase inhibited the Tβ4-induced increase in cell surface ATP levels, as measured by luciferase assay, and the Tβ4-induced increase in HUVEC migration, as measured by transwell migration assay. Silencing of the ATP-responsive purinergic receptor P2X4 with siRNA also blocked Tβ4-induced HUVEC migration in a transwell assay. Furthermore, in silico we identified common amphiphilic α-helical structural similarities between β-thymosins and the inhibitory factor 1 (IF1), an inhibitor of ATP synthase hydrolysis. In summary, we have identified an extracellular signaling pathway where Tβ4 increases cell surface ATP levels via ATP synthase and have shown further that ATP-responsive P2X4 receptor is required for Tβ4-induced HUVEC migration."

In addition, ACBP is known to donate acyl-CoA esters to phospholipid, glycerolipid, and cholesteryl ester (CE) synthesis (14Chao H. Martin G.G. Russell W.K. Waghela S.D. Russell D.H. Schroeder F.

J. 1994; 299: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Finally, proteolytic products of secreted ACBP have been shown to have signaling functions in Dictyostelium as well as mammalian cells (22Loomis W.F. Behrens M.M. Williams M.E. Anjard C. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 21359-21365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the yeast ACBP gene (ACB1) revealed that ACBP deficiency results in increased levels of C18:0 acyl-CoA esters and a decrease in the amount of total C26:0 fatty acids, indicating that transport of FA toward elongation is impaired by lack of ACBP. Furthermore, sphingolipid and ceramide amounts were reduced, membrane structure was altered, and vesicular transport was compromised (23Schjerling C.K. Hummel R. Hansen J.K. Borsting C.

The functions of ACBP in lipid metabolism have been further studied in different mammalian cell culture systems and animal models by both knockdown strategies and overexpression of the protein. It has been reported that knockdown of ACBP by small interfering RNA causes growth arrest and lethality in three different mammalian cell lines (26Faergeman N.J. Knudsen J. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); however, data from our laboratory show that ACBP can be knocked down in many different cell systems without affecting growth and survival (27Mandrup S.

Neess, S. Bek, A.-B. Marcher, and S. Mandrup, unpublished data. Recently, knockdown of ACBP in HepG2 cells was shown to suppress the expression of a number of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis and lead to decreased levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (28Vock C. Biedasek K. Boomgaarden I. Heins A. Nitz I. Döring F. Cell Physiol. Biochem. 2010; 25: 675-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, knockdown of ACBP caused a mild impairment of adipocyte differentiation and accumulation of triacylglycerol (TAG) (27Mandrup S. Sorensen R.V. Helledie T. Nohr J. Baldursson T. Gram C. Knudsen J. Kristiansen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23897-23903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of ACBP in McA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells resulted in increased intracellular TAG accumulation (29Yang Y. Pritchard P.H. Bhuiyan J. Seccombe D.W. Moghadasian M.H. Lipids. 2001; 36: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Overexpression of ACBP in transgenic mice resulted in accumulation of different lipid classes, including TAG in the liver (30Huang H. Atshaves B.P. Frolov A. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10282-10297Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results suggest that ACBP may play a role in TAG synthesis. Furthermore, transgenic rats overexpressing ACBP show decreased hepatic mRNA levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors γ and δ and SREBP-1 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1) in the fed but not the fasted state (31Oikari S. Ahtialansaari T. Heinonen M.V. Mauriala T. Auriola S. Kiehne K. Fölsch U.R. Jänne J. Alhonen L. Herzig K.H. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recently, mice carrying the nm1054 mutation (∼400-kb deletion on chromosome 1, including the Acbp sequence and five other genes) were characterized. These mice have sparse hair with a greasy appearance and sebocyte hyperplasia (32Lee L. DeBono C.A. Campagna D.R. Young D.C. Moody D.B. Fleming M.D. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 16-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Furthermore, lipid analyses showed that they have a decreased amount of TAG on the fur compared with control mice, whereas TAG levels in the skin and liver were similar. While this paper was in preparation, a new report was published showing that disruption of ACBP in mice causes preimplantation embryonic lethality (33Landrock D. Atshaves B.P. McIntosh A.L. Landrock K.K. Schroeder F. Kier A.B. Lipids. 2010; 45: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for these findings, which are at odds with results from our laboratory and those from the nm1054 mice, is not clear. During the suckling-weaning transition, where pups change diet from the high fat breast milk to the standard carbohydrate-rich chow, the liver undergoes significant metabolic changes to adapt to the alterations in energy substrate (reviewed for rats in Ref. 34Girard J. Ferré P. Pégorier J.P. Duée P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Immediately after birth, mice feed exclusively on breast milk provided by the mother. Subsequently, the mice begin natural weaning, gradually increasing the intake of chow while still suckling. This natural weaning continues until the age of ∼3–4 weeks, from which point the mice feed exclusively on chow. During the suckling period, the liver produces glucose and ketone bodies; however, at the suckling-weaning transition, the need for hepatic glucose production by gluconeogenesis ceases due to the increase in consumption of carbohydrate-rich chow. Coordinately, the hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketone body production is reduced. At the suckling-weaning transition, where the high fat breast milk diet is substituted with the carbohydrate-rich chow, the hepatic synthesis of fatty acids from carbohydrates increases as a consequence of the increased expression and activity of lipogenic enzymes (e.g. ACC, FAS, and ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) (reviewed for rats in Ref. 34Girard J. Ferré P. Pégorier J.P. Duée P.H. Physiol. Rev. 1992; 72: 507-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). These inductions of lipogenic genes are thought to be mediated by an increase in the expression of the mature nuclear form of SREBP-1 (35Botolin D. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6959-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The members of the SREBP family are important regulators of hepatic lipogenesis (36Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 37Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c expression is activated transcriptionally by insulin and by oxysterols through activation of liver X-activated receptors, whereas SREBP-2 activity is primarily regulated by posttranslational processing (39Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar, 40Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). However, the Srebp-1c and -2 genes are also autoactivated in a feed-forward regulatory loop involving sterol regulatory element sites in their promoters (41Sato R. Inoue J. Kawabe Y. Kodama T.

The SREBPs are synthesized as inactive precursors (pSREBP), which are bound to the SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) in the ER membrane. Retention of the pSREBP·SCAP complex in the ER membrane is determined by insulin-induced gene (Insig) proteins that reside in the ER membrane and interact with the pSREBP·SCAP complex in a steroid-dependent manner (43Brown A.J.

Lipid Res. 2007; 48: 1944-1954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). When steroid levels are low, the pSREBP·SCAP complex translocates to the Golgi, where pSREBP is cleaved to generate the mature nuclear form (nSREBP) (47Duncan E.A. Davé U.P. Sakai J. Goldstein J.L.

Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). The nSREBPs then enter the nucleus, where they bind as dimers to target sites and promote transcriptional activation of a number of lipogenic and cholesterogenic genes (49Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We have generated mice with targeted disruption of the ACBP gene (ACBP−/−) and show here that depletion of ACBP results in a delayed adaptation of the liver to weaning due to a delayed induction of lipogenic pathways. This is caused by a compromised expression and maturation of SREBP precursors and a reduced binding of SREBP to their target gene promoters. The mouse ACBP genomic sequence was derived from a 129SV mouse genomic library (lambda FIX® II (Stratagene)). 7S. Mandrup, unpublished data. The targeting vector was generated by replacing exon 2 and parts of introns 1 and 2 with a 2-kb loxP-flanked neomycin resistance cassette under control of the PGK1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1) promoter. The vector also contained a cassette for negative selection (PGK1 promoter-driven thymidine kinase cassette 5′ of the Acbp gene). R1 embryonic stem (ES) cells (kindly provided by Dr. Andreas Nagy, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada) were electroporated with linearized vector and submitted to G418 and ganciclovir selection. Clones were characterized by Southern blotting and PCR analysis. Targeted embryonic stem cells with no additional random insertions were injected into C57Bl/6N blastocysts, which were transferred to pseudopregnant foster mothers. The chimeric offspring were mated with C57BL/6JBomTac mice to generate ACBP+/− founders, which were backcrossed to C57Bl/6JBomTac wild type mice for more than 10 generations. Mice were housed at the Biomedical Laboratory, University of Southern Denmark, under standard laboratory conditions, including a 12-h light/dark cycle and free access to water and food (altromin 1324 for maintenance, altromin 1314 for breeding and lactation). The room was controlled at ∼55% relative humidity at 22 ± 3 °C. Breeding of transgenic mice and animal experiments were approved by the Danish Animal Experiment Inspectorate. Mice used for the growth curve experiment were weighed every other day in the period 3–35 days of age and every fourth day hereafter. Besides the normal chow diet supplied in the cage lid throughout the period, mice were provided a soaked chow diet and water in the bottom of the cage from day 14 to 35. The mice were housed along with their mother and littermates until 21 days of age. At 21 days of age, pups were removed from their mother and housed with littermates until day 35. Mice were divided by gender, and pups from different litters were mixed in order to have groups of mice consisting of 4–7 individuals/cage. The pups sacrificed at day 21 or earlier were removed from their mother immediately before euthanasia. Mice at all ages and for all experiments were killed between 8 and 11 a.m. unless otherwise stated. For determination of gene expression by DNA microarray and single gene real-time PCR, protein analyses by Western blotting and ChIP, the mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tissues were dissected. All tissue used for RNA and protein extracts were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fed state 21-day-old mice were anesthetized in the morning (8–11 a.m.) by 25% hypnorm, 25% dormicum in sterile water (0.01 ml/g mouse), and blood was sampled by heart puncture into EDTA-coated tubes. Plasma was separated by centrifugation and analyzed by a mouse insulin ELISA kit (10-1149, Mercodia) according to the manufacturer's instructions by use of Victor2 multilabel counter (Wallac) ELISA plate reader. Paraffin sections were mounted on SuperFrostPlus® microscopic slides and dried (60 °C, 60 min), paraffin was removed with xylene, and sections were rehydrated with ethanol and H2O. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by immersion in 1.5% H2O2 in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl (TBS) for 10 min, and slides were rinsed in H2O. Antigen retrieval was performed by microwave heating in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9, containing 0.5 mm EGTA (1000 W until boiling and 440 W for 15 min). Slides were rinsed in tap water for 5 min and washed twice for 2 min in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TNT). Prior to incubation with antibody, sections were incubated with 10% FCS in TBS (30 min at room temperature). For detection of ACBP, sections were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-Rat ACBP antibody (442, SN11/7-95 no. 27; kindly provided by Dr. Karsten Kristiansen), diluted 1:500 in 10% FCS in TBS. Subsequently, sections were washed in TNT and incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody Rabbit EnVision+ System-HRP-labeled polymer from DakoCytomation (Dako K4003). After rinsing with TNT buffer, sections were incubated in diaminobenzidene solution (0.5 mg/ml diaminobenzidene; 0.015% hydrogen peroxide in TBS) for 10 min and H2O for 5 min. Stained sections were dehydrated and mounted with AquaTex (Merck Eurolab) coverslips. In some sections, nuclei were stained with hematoxylin. For whole cell mouse liver extracts, frozen tissue was homogenized in SDS lysis buffer (2.3% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)), boiled, and treated with benzonase (Merck). Livers used for nuclear extracts were harvested at 6 a.m. Nuclear extracts were prepared from three livers from 21-day-old mice. The livers were washed and homogenized in PBS containing 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.4 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mg/ml PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA. Cells were centrifuged, and nuclei were released by Dounce homogenization in cell lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mg/ml PMSF, 50 μg/ml ALLN). Nuclei were resuspended in 6 ml of homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.15 mm spermine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mg/ml PMSF, 50 μg/ml ALLN), centrifuged through 10 ml of homogenization buffer (120,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 h), and resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mg/ml PMSF, 50 μg/ml ALLN). Protein concentration was determined using the RCDC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of proteins from individual mice were pooled according to the different groups. For Western blotting of nuclear extracts, liver from fasted/refed and lovastatin/Zetia-fed mice were used for SREBP-1- and SREBP-2-positive controls, respectively. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (20 mA/gel) and blotted onto a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (GE Healthcare) by wet blotting (400 mA, 1 h). Subsequently, the membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in PBS, pH 8.9, 0.1% Tween 20 or in TBS, pH 7.6, 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma). The membranes were incubated with primary antibody in 2–5% nonfat milk in PBS or TBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (room temperature, 1 h to overnight) and incubated with secondary antibody in 2–5% nonfat milk in PBS or TBS (room temperature, 1 h). The membranes were washed in PBS or TBS before ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences). The light emitted by the oxidized luminol was detected by Kodak X-OMAT UV film. Equal loading was confirmed by Amido Black staining of the membrane and ECL detection of transcription factor IIB (TFIIB). Primary antibodies used were rabbit antiserum against mouse ACBP (1:1500), kindly provided by Dr. Jens Knudsen, rabbit anti-human TFIIB C-18 (1:1000) (sc-225, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA)), FAS (1:1000) (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), HMGCR (1:1000) (C-18 sc-27578, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and SREBP-1 and -2 (1:1000), kindly provided by Dr. Timothy F. Osborne. Secondary antibody used was horseradish peroxidase-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) (Dako). Frozen liver tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentration and quality was evaluated by use of the NanoDropTM 1000 spectrophotometer and by gel electrophoresis. RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized as described previously (52Hansen J.B. Petersen R.K. Larsen B.M. Bartkova J. Alsner J. Kristiansen K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2386-2393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The resulting cDNA was diluted in 300 μl of H2O. Real-time PCR was carried out using SYBR Green Jumpstart Taq Ready Mix (Sigma). All real-time PCRs were run on MX3000P (Stratagene) at the following conditions: 2 min at 96 °C (hot start), 40 cycles of 10 s at 96 °C, 15 s at 60 °C, and 15 s at 72 °C.

The DNA expression microarray analysis was performed on the Mouse Genome 430_2.0 Array GeneChip® (Affymetrix). Complementary cDNA was synthesized from RNA and made double-stranded. An oligo(dT) primer, which contains a T7 RNA polymerase site, was used for cRNA synthesis. The cRNA was labeled with biotin and fragmented to 100–120 base fragments, which were hybridized to the array chip. Steptavidin-phycoerythrin and anti-streptavidin-phycoerythrin were added, and signals were detected by a laser scanner. Data were processed using standard Affymetrix software MAS5. The full array data set is available in the Gene Expression Omnibus database with accession number GSE24451. 50 mg of frozen liver tissue was homogenized in 1.5 ml of PBS and cross-linked for 10 min in 1% formaldehyde (with agitation at room temperature). Glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.125 m, 10 min. Cells were precipitated by centrifugation, washed twice in cold PBS, resuspended in 300 μl of ChIP lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris, pH 8) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were sonicated 12 times for 30 s at maximum setting (BioruptorTM, Diagenode) and centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 1 min). 200 μl of ChIP lysis buffer was added to the supernatant, and 100 μl of this was used for one ChIP reaction. ChIP lysis buffer (300 μl) and 2 μl of SREBP-2 antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. Timothy F. Osborne) were added to the 100 μl of chromatin, and samples were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation. Protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) (20 μl/reaction) were washed three times in ChIP lysis buffer and incubated with 1 μg of BSA in a total volume of 100 μl for 2 h (4 °C, with rotation). Prepared beads (100 μl) were added to the chromatin and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotor. Beads were washed, and DNA-protein complexes were diluted and decross-linked as described previously (53Nielsen R. Grøntved L. Stunnenberg H.G. Mandrup S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 5698-5714Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and resuspended in 200 μl of H2O. Real-time PCR was run as described above. Primers used were as follows: BG1 forward, 5′-TGGTAGCCTCAGGAGCTTGC; BG1 reverse, 5′-ATCCAAGATGGGACCAAGCTG; BG2 forward, 5′-GGGTCTCTTCCTCTTACCCGAT; BG2 reverse, 5′-ACCTTGCTGGCCATGGAC; Acss2 forward, 5′-GGAGTGTCACCCAGAAGGAA; Acss2 reverse,"
https://openalex.org/W2015943325,"Bacterioferritin (BFR) from Escherichia coli is a member of the ferritin family of iron storage proteins and has the capacity to store very large amounts of iron as an Fe3+ mineral inside its central cavity. The ability of organisms to tap into their cellular stores in times of iron deprivation requires that iron must be released from ferritin mineral stores. Currently, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which this occurs, particularly in prokaryotic ferritins. Here we show that the bis-Met-coordinated heme groups of E. coli BFR, which are not found in other members of the ferritin family, play an important role in iron release from the BFR iron biomineral: kinetic iron release experiments revealed that the transfer of electrons into the internal cavity is the rate-limiting step of the release reaction and that the rate and extent of iron release were significantly increased in the presence of heme. Despite previous reports that a high affinity Fe2+ chelator is required for iron release, we show that a large proportion of BFR core iron is released in the absence of such a chelator and further that chelators are not passive participants in iron release reactions. Finally, we show that the catalytic ferroxidase center, which is central to the mechanism of mineralization, is not involved in iron release; thus, core mineralization and release processes utilize distinct pathways.

IntroductionThe insolubility and potential toxicity of the essential metal iron led to the evolution of the ferritin family of proteins, which function to maintain cellular stores of iron in a non-toxic form (1Andrews S.C. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 40: 281-351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Harrison P.M. Arosio P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1275: 161-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2212) Google Scholar). Ferritins are generally composed of 24 α-helical subunits that pack to form a highly symmetric dodecahedron protein coat with a hollow center in which large amounts of iron, in the form of a ferric oxy-hydroxide mineral, can be stored (3Theil E.C. Matzapetakis M. Liu X.F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 11: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 4Chasteen N.D. Ferritin. Uptake, storage, and release of iron.Metal Ions Biol.

Dalton Trans. 2005; : 3597-3610Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).To satisfy the cellular requirements for iron, ferritins must exhibit flexibility of iron flux, depositing it within their central cavity in times of excess and releasing it back to the cellular machinery in times of environmental deficit (6Abdul-Tehrani H. Hudson A.J. Chang Y.S. Timms A.R. Hawkins C. Williams J.M. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Fu X. Deng J. Yang H. Masuda T.

Maldonado M.T. Armbrust E.V. Nature. 2009; 457: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ferritins generate their iron mineral cargo has been the focus of much attention (3Theil E.C. Matzapetakis M. Liu X.F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2006; 11: 803-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 4Chasteen N.D. Ferritin. Uptake, storage, and release of iron.Metal Ions Biol.

Central to this process is an intrasubunit di-iron site called the ferroxidase center, which is found only in H-chain and H-chain-like subunits. Another type of subunit, the L-chain, found in animal ferritins and isostructural with the H-chain in terms of intersubunit contacts, does not contain the ferroxidase center. The mechanism of mineral formation depends on the type of ferritin. In eukaryotic ferritins, the ferroxidase center operates as a gated iron pore, facilitating the transfer of oxidized iron into the central cavity. Some prokaryotic ferritins also exhibit this type of mechanism, whereas others, including the bacterioferritin (BFR) from Escherichia coli and the ferritin-like protein (Ftn) from Pyrococcus furiosus, exhibit a quite different mechanism, in which the ferroxidase center functions as a true catalytic center, cycling between diferrous and bridged diferric forms as Fe2+ ions are oxidized within the central cavity (see Ref. 9Le Brun N.E. Crow A. Murphy M.E. Mauk A.G. Moore G.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1800: 732-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar and references therein).In general, much less is known about the mechanism(s) of iron release. It was shown that E. coli cells carrying iron-loaded FtnA (a bacterial ferritin) have an iron-restricted growth advantage over those lacking FtnA (6Abdul-Tehrani H. Hudson A.J. Chang Y.S. Timms A.R. Hawkins C. Williams J.M. Harrison P.M. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1415-1428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that iron stored within ferritins can be mobilized for cellular anabolic processes. However, the mechanism by which this occurs is not clear. One possibility involves proteolytic degradation of the ferritin protein shell, and in animal ferritins, this occurs in the lysosome (10Radisky D.C. Kaplan J. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, this represents a highly uncontrolled release process, and it is likely that in most cases iron release is carefully controlled to avoid the toxic effects of iron. It has been shown that, in general, this requires a supply of electrons to reduce mineral Fe3+ to Fe2+, together with a chelator to accept the iron upon reduction. The ability of a wide range of reductants (including dithionite, thiols, ascorbate, superoxide, dihydroflavins, and diphenols) to drive the release of ferritins has been reported (11Richards T.D. Pitts K.R. Watt G.D. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1996; 61: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Funk F. Lenders J.P. Crichton R.R. Schneider W. Eur. J.

Despite these general principles, there is a lack of consensus about the means by which electrons are transferred to the ferric mineral. For example, it was demonstrated that reductants too large to traverse the protein coat (e.g. flavoproteins and ferredoxins) are efficient in promoting core reduction (18Watt G.D. Jacobs D. Frankel R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that electron transfer across the protein coat must occur. On the other hand, whereas dihydroflavins are efficient in promoting iron release, it was also shown that immobilized versions of the same flavins are not, implying that entry into the cavity is a necessary step (15Jones T. Spencer R. Walsh C. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4011-4017Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that reduction of the ferric mineral core results in an Fe2+ core, without significant iron release (18Watt G.D. Jacobs D. Frankel R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 7457-7461Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 19Watt G.D. Frankel R.B. Papaefthymiou G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5672-5679Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to a reductant, a strong Fe2+ chelator is also apparently required to effect iron release.In BFRs, an important consideration for the mechanism of iron release is the presence of 12 intersubunit heme groups, which are not present in other types of ferritins (21Stiefel E.I. Watt G.D. Nature. 1979; 279: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 22Frolow F. Kalb A.J. Yariv J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and which are not required for the formation of the mineral (23Andrews S.C. Le Brun N.E. Barynin V. Thomson A.J. Moore G.R. Guest J.R. Harrison P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23268-23274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), indicating that the heme serves another function. Interestingly, heme-deficient variants of BFR have been isolated containing significantly more iron than the wild-type protein produced under identical conditions (23Andrews S.C. Le Brun N.E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 23268-23274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggesting that these variants are deficient in iron release and that heme groups may be involved in iron release. More direct evidence appeared to come from in vitro kinetic studies (24Moore G.R. Kadir F.H. al-Massad F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1992; 47: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), although subsequently the same authors reported that the P. aeruginosa BFR used in this work may have been damaged in some way (25Moore G.R.

J. 1994; 304: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Although the mechanism of iron core mineralization has been characterized in detail for E. coli BFR, the mobilization of iron from the protein's mineral core has not been studied. An understanding of this process would provide insight into how the uptake and release processes within a single BFR may be balanced to provide flexible and dynamic iron management within a cell. Here we show that the rate at which iron is mobilized from the iron mineral core of E. coli BFR is dependent on heme but not on the ferroxidase center, demonstrating that uptake and release processes are distinct. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that electron transfer into the mineral core is the rate-determining step of the release process.

https://openalex.org/W2042829468,"Arrestins can facilitate desensitization or signaling by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) in many cells, but their roles in platelets remain uncharacterized. Because of recent reports that arrestins can serve as scaffolds to recruit phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K)s to GPCRs, we sought to determine whether arrestins regulate PI3K-dependent Akt signaling in platelets, with consequences for thrombosis. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that arrestin-2 associates with p85 PI3Kα/β subunits in thrombin-stimulated platelets, but not resting cells. The association is inhibited by inhibitors of P2Y12 and Src family kinases (SFKs). The function of arrestin-2 in platelets is agonist-specific, as PAR4-dependent Akt phosphorylation and fibrinogen binding were reduced in arrestin-2 knock-out platelets compared with WT controls, but ADP-stimulated signaling to Akt and fibrinogen binding were unaffected. ADP receptors regulate arrestin recruitment to PAR4, because co-immunoprecipitates of arrestin-2 with PAR4 are disrupted by inhibitors of P2Y1 or P2Y12. P2Y1 may regulate arrestin-2 recruitment to PAR4 through protein kinase C (PKC) activation, whereas P2Y12 directly interacts with PAR4 and therefore, may help to recruit arrestin-2 to PAR4. Finally, arrestin2(-/-) mice are less sensitive to ferric chloride-induced thrombosis than WT mice, suggesting that arrestin-2 can regulate thrombus formation in vivo. In conclusion, arrestin-2 regulates PAR4-dependent signaling pathways, but not responses to ADP alone, and contributes to thrombus formation in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2138437398,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a cytokine that mediates inflammatory diseases. MIF promotes atherogenic leukocyte recruitment through a promiscuous, yet highly affine, interaction with CXCR2 and CXCR4. Binding to CXCR2 is dependent on a pseudo-(E)LR motif in MIF, but a second interaction site has been elusive. Here we identified an N-like loop in MIF, suggesting that MIF binding to CXCR2 follows the 2-site binding mode of bona fide chemokines. For MIF, the model predicts interactions between the N-like loop and the CXCR2 N domain (site 1) and pseudo-(E)LR and extracellular loops (ELs) of CXCR2 (site 2). Applying biophysical and peptide array analysis, we demonstrated an interaction between MIF and the CXCR2 N domain, which was pseudo-(E)LR independent. Peptide array analysis also indicated that the pseudo-(E)LR motif is responsible for MIF binding to EL2 and 3. Notably, peptides MIF-(40-49) and MIF-(47-56), representing N-like-loop-derived peptides, but not a scrambled control peptide, significantly blocked MIF/CXCR2 binding, MIF-mediated monocyte arrest under flow on aortic endothelial cells in vitro (IC(50): 1.24×10(-6) M), and MIF-dependent monocyte adhesion to atherosclerotic mouse carotid arteries in vivo. Thus, the N-like loop in MIF is critical for MIF's noncognate interaction with CXCR2 and proatherogenic functions. The 2-site binding model that explains chemokine receptor activation also applies to MIF."
https://openalex.org/W1979485290,"The premature aging and cancer-prone disease Werner syndrome is caused by loss of function of the RecQ helicase family member Werner syndrome protein (WRN). At the cellular level, loss of WRN results in replication abnormalities and chromosomal aberrations, indicating that WRN plays a role in maintenance of genome stability. Consistent with this notion, WRN possesses annealing, exonuclease, and ATPase-dependent helicase activity on DNA substrates, with particularly high affinity for and activity on replication and recombination structures. After certain DNA-damaging treatments, WRN is recruited to sites of blocked replication and co-localizes with the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA). In this study we examined the physical and functional interaction between WRN and RPA specifically in relation to replication fork blockage. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that damaging treatments that block DNA replication substantially increased association between WRN and RPA in vivo, and a direct interaction between purified WRN and RPA was confirmed. Furthermore, we examined the combined action of RPA (unmodified and hyperphosphorylation mimetic) and WRN on model replication fork and gapped duplex substrates designed to bind RPA. Even with RPA bound stoichiometrically to this gap, WRN efficiently catalyzed regression of the fork substrate. Further analysis showed that RPA could be displaced from both substrates by WRN. RPA displacement by WRN was independent of its ATPase- and helicase-dependent remodeling of the fork.

Accumulating evidence indicates that blocks to replication fork progression are common occurrences that must be properly dealt with to complete DNA synthesis and prevent genomic instability. Replication fork progression may be blocked by the persistence of certain types of DNA damage, by non-canonical DNA structures or by proteins tightly bound or cross-linked to parental DNA. Cells have evolved pathways that accurately resolve replication fork blockage, allowing restart and completion of DNA replication. RecQ helicases are critical for chromosome stability, hypothetically by participating in proper resolution of replication fork blockage (1Atkinson J. McGlynn P. Nucleic.

Although these diseases show genomic instability and elevated cancer predispositon, each has a distinct phenotype, suggesting that these proteins have at least some non-overlapping functions. Among these syndromes, Werner syndrome notably shows early onset and increased frequency of many age-related features (6Goto M. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1997; 98: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 7Martin G.M. Oshima J. Nature. 2000; 408: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The basic biochemical properties of recombinant WRN protein have been characterized. In agreement with its classification as a RecQ family member, WRN is a DNA-dependent ATPase and in combination with ATP hydrolysis can unwind DNA duplexes of limited length with a 3′ to 5′ directionality. However, WRN preferentially unwinds or disrupts more complex DNA structures including forks, D-loops, G-quartets, and triplexes (8Opresko P.L. Cheng W.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18099-18102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). WRN is unique among the human RecQ helicases in that it exhibits a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity that also acts with higher specificity toward complex DNA structures (9Huang S. Beresten S. Li B. Oshima J. Ellis N.A. Campisi J. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2396-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 10Machwe A. Xiao L. Theodore S. Orren D.K. J. Biol.

A number of RecQ helicases, including WRN, BLM, RECQ1, RECQ4, and RECQ5 (β isoform) proteins, promote the annealing of complementary DNA strands, and coordination between the unwinding and annealing activities of WRN, BLM, and RECQ5 (β isoform) can mediate strand exchange between appropriate DNA molecules (12Cheok C.F.

The biochemical properties of WRN and other RecQ helicases suggest that these proteins act on complex DNA structures such as three- or four-stranded intermediates formed during replication and recombination. In support of a replication-related role for WRN, WRN-deficient cells show replication abnormalities including slow growth, an extended S-phase, and asymmetric replication fork progression (18Poot M. Hoehn H. Rünger T.M. Martin G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 202: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 19Rodríguez-López A.M. Jackson D.A. Iborra F. Cox L.S. Aging Cell. 2002; 1: 30-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). WRN-deficient cells are also hypersensitive to certain DNA damaging agents, particularly those known to block replication such as hydroxyurea (HU), 3The abbreviations used are: HU, hydroxyurea; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thio)triphosphate; MMS, methylmethanesulfonate; RPA, human replication protein A; WRN, Werner syndrome protein; nt, ss32, 32-mer; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. topoisomerase inhibitors, and interstrand cross-linkers (20Lebel M.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1224-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In normal cells, after treatment with HU and other DNA damaging agents, WRN relocates to distinct nuclear foci where it co-localizes with replication factors, indicating that it is recruited to sites of blocked replication (23Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 24Pichierri P. Rosselli F. Franchitto A.

Taken together, these studies indicate that WRN may play an important role in response to replication fork blockage. According to models proposed for resolution of replication blockage, an early event in the process involves fork regression to generate a Holliday junction or “chicken foot” intermediate (26Cox M.M. Mutat. Res. 2002; 510: 107-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 27Haber J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 271-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 28Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Considered in conjunction with the phenotypes of RecQ-deficient cells, the unwinding and annealing activities of some RecQ enzymes suggested that they would be ideal candidates to regress replication forks. In agreement, we found that either WRN or BLM efficiently catalyzed the regression of model replication fork substrates via generation of a Holliday junction intermediate (29Machwe A. Xiao L. Groden J. Orren D.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13939-13946Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Machwe A. Xiao L. Lloyd R.G. Bolt E. Orren D.K. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5729-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, the exonuclease activity of WRN contributed to enhanced regression efficiency on certain fork structures (30Machwe A. Xiao L. Lloyd R.G. Bolt E. Orren D.K. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5729-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In contrast to its relatively weak unwinding activity on simple duplexes, WRN-mediated fork regression occurred readily at near equimolar enzyme-DNA substrate ratios (30Machwe A. Xiao L. Lloyd R.G. Bolt E. Orren D.K. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5729-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, WRN appears enzymatically suited to perform fork regression. Replication protein A (RPA), is a heterotrimeric (70-, 32-, and 14-kDa subunits, hereafter referred to as RPA70, RPA32, and RPA14, respectively) single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding factor involved in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (31Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 32Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Among its many roles, RPA binds to ssDNA gaps generated by stalled replication forks, an action that not only protects this region but also plays a key role in initiating and directing downstream pathways (32Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 33Raderschall E. Golub E.I. Haaf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1921-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Specifically, RPA promotes checkpoint signaling after replication fork stalling through its recruitment and activation of ATR·ATRIP and possibly RAD17 complexes (34Dart D.A. Adams K.E. Akerman I. Lakin N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16433-16440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 35Zou L. Elledge S.J.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 13827-13832Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RPA binding to ssDNA overhangs at strand breaks recruits RAD51 and other recombination factors required to initiate homologous recombination processes (37Binz S.K. Sheehan A.M. Wold M.S. DNA Repair. 2004; 3: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 38Jackson S.P. Carcinogenesis. 2002; 23: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In addition, RPA function is regulated by phosphorylation of the N-terminal region of the RPA32 subunit. RPA is phosphorylated during the normal cell cycle (39Din S. Brill S.J. Fairman M.P. Stillman B. Genes. Dev. 1990; 4: 968-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 40Dutta A. Stillman B. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 41Mitsis P.G. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and hyperphosphorylated in response to treatment of cells with DNA damaging agents such as camptothecin or UV (42Oakley G.G. Loberg L.I. Yao J. Risinger M.A. Yunker R.L. Zernik-Kobak M. Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Carty M.P. Dixon K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1199-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 43Shao R.G. Cao C.X. Zhang H. Kohn K.W. Wold M.S. Pommier Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). RPA hyperphosphorylation apparently modulates multiple cellular responses to DNA damage, including possible down-regulation of DNA replication (44Anantha R.W. Borowiec J.A. Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, hyperphosphorylation of RPA may reflect its conversion from a DNA replication factor to a DNA damage response factor. Studies have also revealed a physical and functional interaction between RPA and WRN. RPA and WRN directly interact in vitro, and RPA enhances WRN unwinding strength (45Brosh Jr., R.M. Orren D.K. Nehlin J.O. Ravn P.H. Kenny M.K. Machwe A. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18341-18350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 46Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nucleic. Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2879-2885Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In response to HU treatments, WRN and RPA co-localize in replication foci thought to represent sites of blocked replication (23Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that WRN and RPA might interact at stalled replication forks, facilitating WRN function in proper resolution of replication blockage. Here, we examine the molecular and functional interaction of WRN and RPA specifically in regard to replication blockage. We have found that treatments that generate DNA damage known to block replication fork progression result in an increased association between WRN and RPA and have shown a direct interaction between purified WRN and RPA. Because WRN readily regresses model replication forks (29Machwe A. Xiao L. Groden J. Orren D.K. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13939-13946Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Machwe A. Xiao L. Lloyd R.G. Bolt E. Orren D.K. Nucleic. Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5729-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) in perhaps an early step in resolution of fork blockage, we were interested in examining the effect of RPA on WRN-mediated enzymatic activities including fork regression. Thus, we designed replication fork and gapped duplex substrates containing ssDNA gaps sufficient to bind RPA. After confirming that RPA stably binds to these substrates, its effect on WRN action was examined. Our results demonstrate that WRN efficiently regresses our replication fork substrate even when RPA (either wild type or hyperphosphorylation mimetic RPA-32D8) is bound to the single-stranded gap. Furthermore, RPA bound to this fork substrate could be displaced by WRN, independent of its catalytic activity. Thus, these findings support the concept that RPA and WRN act in concert at stalled replication forks and suggest a reasonable model for the molecular and functional cooperation between these factors during proper resolution of replication blockage. The WRN-E84A protein possesses normal DNA-dependent ATPase and helicase activities but contains a glutamate to alanine mutation that abolishes exonuclease activity (47Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). WRN-E84A was overexpressed and purified as described previously (15Machwe A. Xiao L. Groden J. Matson S.W. Orren D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23397-23407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Unmodified, wild type RPA (RPA-wt) and phosphomimetic RPA (RPA-32D8) were purified as described earlier (31Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 48Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequences of gel-purified oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) are given in supplemental Table 1, with “P” and “D” designations indicating parental and daughter strands, respectively. For studying the binding of RPA-wt or RPA-32D8 to a model replication fork by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) and their effect on WRN-mediated fork regression, the fork substrate was constructed as described below. The lagP122 and leadD52 oligomers were radiolabeled (indicated by asterisks) at their 5′ ends using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). In two separate annealing reactions, the labeled lagP122 and leadD52 oligomers were combined with lagD82 and leadP122 oligomers, respectively, heated to 95 °C, and subsequently slow-cooled to create lagging and leading parental-daughter partial duplexes. These partial duplexes (*lagP122/lagD82 and leadP122/*leadD52) were then incubated together for 24 h at 25 °C to generate double-labeled replication fork substrate (*lagP122/lagD82-leadP122/*leadD52). However, for DNase I footprinting studies, the fork substrate (lagP122/lagD82-*leadP122/leadD52) was labeled only on the leadP122 strand; this substrate was also used in EMSA experiments examining RPA displacement. The gapped duplex substrate was generated by annealing leadD52 and lagP38-3′ to radiolabeled leadP122. Annealing reactions containing these substrates were subject to native polyacrylamide (8%) gel electrophoresis (PAGE), bands corresponding to the fork and gapped duplex substrates were excised, and the substrates were extracted for 24 h at 4 °C into DNA elution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl). The 32-mer (ss32) used in the RPA displacement studies was radiolabeled and subjected to native PAGE as described above, but final purification was accomplished using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen). 32P-Labeled fork DNA substrate (1 fmol) was incubated with or without RPA-wt (0.05–5 fmol) or RPA-32D8 (0.04–8 fmol) in WRN reaction buffer (20 μl) containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm ATP for 10 min at 25 °C. In assays studying the effect of WRN-E84A on RPA-wt bound to DNA substrates (Fig. 5 and supplemental Fig. 1), labeled fork DNA (∼15 fmol) or gapped duplex DNA (∼20 fmol) was preincubated with RPA-wt (10 or 20 fmol, respectively) in WRN reaction buffer for 5 min at 25 °C. Then, WRN-E84A (50 fmol) was added to the reactions, which were further incubated at 25 °C for 5 min followed by the addition of radiolabeled ss32 (∼15 or 20 fmol) as indicated and nucleotide cofactor ATPγS or ATP (1 mm) unless otherwise noted. These reactions were then incubated at 37 °C for an additional 10 min. For all EMSA experiments, ⅙ volume of 30% glycerol was added, and the samples were separated by native PAGE (3.5%-3.8%) carried out in 0.5× Tris borate EDTA at 90–100 V at 25 °C. Subsequently, the gels were dried, and DNA and DNA-protein complexes were visualized and quantitated using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). RPA binding was quantified by comparing the amount of bound DNA with the total DNA in the reaction (% DNAbound = DNAbound/[DNAbound + DNAunbound] × 100). Fork DNA substrate (∼5 fmol), labeled on the leadP122 strand, was incubated with or without RPA-wt (0.1–5.0 fmol) or RPA-32D8 (1–32 fmol) in WRN reaction buffer for 10 min at 25 °C. DNase I (0.008 units/reaction) was then added followed by further incubation at 25 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by adding an equal volume of formamide loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol), heated to denature DNA products, and analyzed by denaturing PAGE (10%) carried out in 1× Tris borate EDTA at 45 W for 2 h. The gels were dried and subjected to phosphorimaging analysis as described above. Fork substrate (1–2 fmol) was incubated with WRN-E84A (3.5–7 fmol) in WRN reaction buffer for 5 min at 4 °C and then transferred to 37 °C for the specified times. In reactions studying the effect of RPA on fork regression, the fork substrate was preincubated with either RPA-wt or RPA-32D8 for 5 min at 4 °C before WRN addition. Reactions were stopped using ⅙ volume of helicase dyes (30% glycerol, 50 mm EDTA, 0.9% SDS, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol) and analyzed by native (7Martin G.M. Oshima J.

Gels were dried, and DNA products were visualized and quantified by phosphorimaging analysis as above. Radioactivity associated with each individual DNA species was determined for each reaction, and the percentage of each product with respect to the total DNA was calculated. Total DNA represents the amount of DNA present in each reaction after correction for the background amounts of DNA species (other than the intact fork) present in reactions without enzyme. The SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line, 1-0, used in immunoprecipitation experiments was obtained from J. Christopher States, University of Louisville (49States J.C. Quan T. Hines R.N. Novak R.F. Runge-Morris M. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 1643-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Methylmethanesulfonate (MMS), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), HU, and protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma, and cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. Cells were grown in minimal essential medium-α Glutamax medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% HEPES, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For DNA damaging treatments, cells were incubated in medium containing 1 mm MMS for 4 h or 2 mm HU for 10 h before harvesting. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed by sonication in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 units/ml of DNase I (New England Biolabs). After centrifugation at 21,000 × g for 12 min at 4 °C, supernatants were isolated, and their protein concentrations were measured. Samples (800 μg of protein each) were precleared with Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) and 1 μg of normal mouse IgG (Santa Cruz) for 30 min, then incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-RPA32 antibody (Calbiochem) for 15 h at 4 °C. The samples were subsequently mixed with 30 μl of Protein G Plus/Protein A bead suspension at 4 °C for 3 h. After collection by centrifugation and removal of supernatant, the beads were then washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer supplemented with protease mixture inhibitors, 1 mm PMSF, and 200 μg/ml ethidium bromide. After the final wash, equal portions of immunoprecipitation buffer and 2× SDS sample buffer were added to the beads, and immunoprecipitated proteins were released by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Equal volumes of each sample were resolved by SDS-PAGE (6% or 12% for WRN or RPA, respectively). Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and analyzed by Western analysis with rabbit anti-WRN (Santa Cruz) or mouse anti-RPA32 (Calbiochem) antibodies for 18 h at 4 °C followed by chemiluminescent detection using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). Purified RPA (60 and 120 ng or 0.5 and 1 pmol, respectively) or recombinant WRN (30, 60, and 90 ng or 180, 360, and 540 fmol, respectively) and corresponding concentrations of BSA were applied directly onto nitrocellulose membranes. After allowing the applied samples to dry for 15 min at 4 °C, membranes were blocked for 1 h at 4 °C with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST. The membranes were then incubated in 5 ml of TBST, 5% milk solution (including 25 mm NaCl or 100 mm NaCl as indicated) containing purified WRN (400 ng = 2.4 pmol) or RPA (360 ng = 3 pmol) for 3 h at 4 °C. After washing 3 times for 10 min each with TBST, membranes were subjected to immunodetection by 1) incubation for 1 h with anti-WRN or anti-RPA32 antibody, 2) incubation for 1 h with appropriate HRP-linked secondary antibodies, 3) chemiluminescent development using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare), and 4) visualization by autoradiography. Films were scanned to assess the level of protein binding, with comparison to RPA standards spotted separately on the same membranes. A significant amount of evidence indicates that WRN functions in a pathway that responds to replication blockage to maintain chromosomal stability. A previous study (23Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) showing WRN and RPA colocalization in nuclear foci in response to treatment with HU suggests that these proteins might interact at blocked replication forks. RPA is widely believed to bind and protect ssDNA formed as a result of blockage of replicative DNA synthesis (32Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar, 33Raderschall E. Golub E.I. Haaf T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 1921-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We reasoned that it should be possible to detect interactions between these two proteins within cells, particularly in response to DNA damaging treatments. To investigate this possibility, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted with human fibroblasts treated either for 10 h with or without HU, which blocks DNA replication by depleting deoxynucleotide pools, or for 4 h with or without MMS, an alkylating agent that generates lesions that block DNA synthesis (50Wyatt M.D. Pittman D.L. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 1580-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) and causes modification of WRN and its relocalization to nuclear foci (25Karmakar P. Bohr V.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2005; 126: 1146-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The buffers for this protocol included DNase I during lysis and immunoprecipitation and ethidium bromide during washing of the immunoprecipitate to ensure that protein interactions were not mediated through DNA bridging. Using a monoclonal antibody to the RPA32 subunit, it is clear that RPA is present in equal amounts in the immunoprecipitated fraction in HU- and MMS-treated and untreated cells (Fig. 1, lower panel). Although some association of WRN with RPA is detectable even in untreated cells, the amount of WRN precipitated with RPA is significantly increased in cells treated with MMS or HU (Fig. 1, upper panel). Quantitation of data from multiple independent experiments indicates that MMS and HU treatments result in 4.4- and 2.0-fold increases, respectively, in the levels of WRN that are pulled down with RPA. Thus, these data indicate that DNA damaging treatments that block replication increase the association of WRN with RP"

We recently reported that ethanol and acetaldehyde, the first product of ethanol metabolism, affect transcription of opioid system genes in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. In the current study, potential epigenetic mechanisms were investigated to clarify these effects on prodynorphin gene expression. DNA methylation was analyzed by bisulfite pyrosequencing, and chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to assess putative specific histone modifications at the prodynorphin gene promoter. The results demonstrated a temporal relationship between selective chromatin modifications induced by ethanol and acetaldehyde and changes in prodynorphin gene expression quantitated by real-time qPCR. DNA methylation was not altered in any of the experimental conditions used. The epigenetic changes may precede gene transcription, and histone modifications might keep the prodynorphin gene in a poised state for later reactivation. A link has been observed between gene expression alterations and selective epigenetic modulation in the prodynorphin promoter region, demonstrating a specificity of the changes induced by ethanol and acetaldehyde. The latter may be mediating ethanol effects at the genomic level.—D'Addario, C., Johansson, S., Candeletti, S., Romualdi, P., Ogren, S. O., Terenius, L., Ekstrom,T. J.

https://openalex.org/W2045590160,"Chronic alcohol consumption is associated with steatohepatitis and cirrhosis, enhancing the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. RNA polymerase (pol) III transcribes a variety of small, untranslated RNAs, including tRNAs and 5S rRNAs, which determine the biosynthetic capacity of cells. Increased RNA pol III-dependent transcription, observed in transformed cells and human tumors, is required for oncogenic transformation. Given that alcohol consumption increases risk for liver cancer, we examined whether alcohol regulates this class of genes. Ethanol induces RNA pol III-dependent transcription in both HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatocytes in a manner that requires ethanol metabolism and the activation of JNK1. This regulatory event is mediated, at least in part, through the ability of ethanol to induce expression of the TFIIIB components, Brf1, and the TATA-binding protein (TBP). Induction of TBP, Brf1, and RNA pol III-dependent gene expression is driven by enhanced c-Jun expression. Ethanol promotes a marked increase in the direct recruitment of c-Jun to TBP, Brf1, and tRNA gene promoters. Chronic alcohol administration in mice leads to enhanced expression of TBP, Brf1, tRNA, and 5S rRNA gene transcription in the liver. These alcohol-dependent increases are more pronounced in transgenic animals that express the HCV NS5A protein that display increased incidence of liver tumors. Together, these results identify a new class of genes that are regulated by alcohol through the co-regulation of TFIIIB components and define a central role for c-Jun in this process."
https://openalex.org/W1987991458,"RNA-based drugs are an emerging class of therapeutics. They have the potential to regulate proteins, chromatin, as well as bind to specific proteins of interest in the form of aptamers. These aptamers are protected from nuclease attack by chemical modifications that enhance their stability for in vivo usage. However, nucleases are ubiquitous, and as we have yet to characterize the entire human microbiome it is likely that many nucleases are yet to be identified. Any novel, unusual enzymes present in vivo might reduce the efficacy of RNA-based therapeutics, even when they are chemically modified. We have previously identified an RNA-based aptamer capable of neutralizing a broad spectrum of clinical HIV-1 isolates and are developing it as a vaginal and rectal microbicide candidate. As a first step we addressed aptamer stability in the milieu of proteins present in these environments. Here we uncover a number of different nucleases that are able to rapidly degrade 2'-F-modified RNA. We demonstrate that the aptamer can be protected from the nuclease(s) present in the vaginal setting, without affecting its antiviral activity, by replacement of key positions with 2'-O-Me-modified nucleotides. Finally, we show that the aptamer can be protected from all nucleases present in both vaginal and rectal compartments using Zn(2+) cations. In conclusion we have derived a stable, antiviral RNA-based aptamer that could form the basis of a pre-exposure microbicide or be a valuable addition to the current tenofovir-based microbicide candidate undergoing clinical trials."

https://openalex.org/W2035058023,"Laminar shear stress (LSS) is known to increase endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, which is essential for vascular health, through expression and activation of nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3). Recent studies demonstrated that LSS also increases the expression of argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) that regulates the provision of l-arginine, the substrate of NOS3. It was thus hypothesized that ASS1 might contribute to vascular health by enhancing NO production in response to LSS. This hypothesis was pursued in the present study by modulating NOS3 and ASS1 levels in cultured endothelial cells. Exogenous expression of either NOS3 or ASS1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells increased NO production and decreased monocyte adhesion stimulated by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). The latter effect of overexpressed ASS1 was reduced when human umbilical vein endothelial cells were co-treated with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for ASS1 or NOS3. SiRNAs of NOS3 and ASS1 attenuated the increase of NO production in human aortic endothelial cells stimulated by LSS (12 dynes·cm−2) for 24 h. LSS inhibited monocyte adhesion to human aortic endothelial cells stimulated by TNF-α, but this effect of LSS was abrogated by siRNAs of NOS3 and ASS1 that recovered the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids and fibrous elements in the intimal lining of the large- and medium-sized arteries. Its development takes place step-by-step involving endothelial cell injury, migration of inflammatory cells, deposition of lipids and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, growth of this mass (atheroma) into the vessel lumen, and rupture of the plaque with subsequent thrombosis (1Libby P. Nature. 2002; 420: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (6937) Google Scholar).

Indeed, the straight regions of the arteries that experience pulsatile LSS are usually protected from the formation of atherosclerotic lesions (7Cunningham K.S. Gotlieb A.I. Lab.

The anti-atherogenic effects of pulsatile LSS and steady LSS (the latter does not occur in arteries in vivo but is being studied in vitro) have been attributed to their ability to increase endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production (9Bredt D.S. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). For example, LSS has been shown to inhibit monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells in a NO-dependent manner (10Tsao P.S. Buitrago R. Chan J.R. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). The activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) by Ca2+ or phosphorylation on multiple sites including Ser1177 has been identified as the primary mechanism responsible for the increased NO production under LSS conditions (11Boo Y.C. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C499-C508Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Moreover, the protein level of NOS3 was shown to be increased by chronic LSS in cultured endothelial cells (12Davis M.E. Cai H. Drummond G.R. Harrison D.G. Circ.

Physiol. 2003; 284: H1449-H1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). NOS3 requires tetrahydrobiopterin as an essential cofactor, and recent studies demonstrated that GTP cyclohydrolase-1, a rate-limiting enzyme for de novo synthesis of tetrahydrobiopterin, was activated through the phosphorylation on serine 81 in response to LSS (14Widder J.D. Chen W. Li L. Dikalov S. Thöny B. Hatakeyama K. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2007; 101: 830-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Another study pointed out that the GTP cyclohydrolase-1 expression level was also increased by chronic LSS in cultured endothelial cells (15Mun G.I. An S.M. Park H. Jo H. Boo Y.C. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2008; 295: H1966-H1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) is the key enzyme responsible for the provision of l-arginine, the substrate of NOS3 (16Flam B.R. Eichler D.C. Solomonson L.P. Nitric Oxide. 2007; 17: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and this enzyme might play a role in the endothelial NO production in response to LSS. In support of this notion, cDNA microarray analyses identified the ASS1 gene as one of the genes induced by LSS (17McCormick S.M. Eskin S.G. McIntire L.V. Teng C.L. Lu C.M. Russell C.G. Chittur K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Functional association of ASS1 with altered NO production has recently been verified in young and senescent endothelial cells under static and LSS conditions (18Mun G.I. Lee S.J. An S.M. Kim I.K. Boo Y.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was hypothesized that ASS1 might contribute to vascular health by playing a role in NO production in response to LSS. This hypothesis was pursued in the present study by examining whether endothelial ASS1 is required for the LSS effects of increasing NO production and decreasing monocyte adhesion. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) obtained from Clonetics Cambrex (Rockland, ME) were cultured in EBM-2 medium containing endothelial growth supplements (Clonetics Cambrex), 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and antibiotics (100 units·ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg·ml−1 streptomycin, 0.25 μg·ml−1 amphotericin B) on 0.2% gelatin-coated 6-well tissue culture plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were purchased from Cascade Biologics (Portland, OR) and cultured in Medium 200 with low serum growth supplements (Cascade Biologics) and antibiotics, on 0.2% gelatin-coated 100-mm culture dishes (BD Biosciences). THP-1 cells (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) from the Korea Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), antibiotics, and β-mercaptoethanol (0.05 mm). Cells were cultured in T-25 flasks (Nunc) in an upright position. For fluorescence labeling, monocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice and suspended at 5 × 106 cells·ml−1 in PBS containing 5 μg·ml−1 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA) followed by incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. The labeled cells were then harvested, washed with PBS twice, and suspended in RPMI medium to be added to endothelial cell culture. The full coding sequence of human ASS1 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from a clone (IMAGE ID 30340813, the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and inserted into the pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) vector to generate the ASS1 plasmid construct (pcDNA-ASS1), as described in the previous study (18Mun G.I. Lee S.J. An S.M. Kim I.K. Boo Y.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2009; 47: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The pcDNA-NOS3 construct encoding bovine NOS3 has been described previously (19Boo Y.C. Sorescu G.P. Bauer P.M. Fulton D. Kemp B.E. Harrison D.G. Sessa W.C. Jo H. Free Radic. Biol.

Briefly, cells at ∼90% confluency on a 6-well plate were treated with a mixture of 1 μg of DNA and 3 μl of NeoFectinTM in 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) for 4 h. For co-transfection studies, cells were treated with a mixture of 1 μg of DNA, 25 pmol of small interfering RNA (siRNA), and 3 μl of NeoFectinTM. Human ASS1 siRNA (catalog number 1299001, HSS100763) with the nucleotide sequences corresponding to the coding region of a human ASS1 gene transcript (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBankTM accession number, NM_000050), human NOS3 siRNA (1299001, HSS107237) with nucleotide sequences corresponding to the coding region of a human NOS3 gene transcript (NM_000603.3), and a negative control oligoribonucleotide duplex (12935200) with scrambled sequences were purchased from Invitrogen. The nucleotide sequences of ASS1 siRNA and NOS3 siRNA were as follows: ASS1 siRNA, 5′-UCA UUG GAA UGA AGU CCC GAG GUA U-3′ (sense) and 5′-AUA CCU CGG GAC UUC AUU CCA AUG A-3′(antisense); NOS3 siRNA, 5′-GAA GAG GAA GGA GUC CAG UAA CAC A-3′ (sense) and 5′-UGU GUU ACU GGA CUC CUU CCU CUU C-3′ (antisense). Transfection of HAECs with siRNAs was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, cells at ∼50% confluency on an 100-mm culture dish were treated with a mixture of 25 nm siRNA and 1.25 μl·ml−1 Lipofectamine RNAiMAX in 5 ml of Opti-MEM for 3 h. After the growth medium was changed with a fresh one, HAECs on an 100-mm culture dish were exposed to steady LSS at 12 dynes·cm−2 or kept under static conditions for 24 h. LSS was provided by rotating a Teflon cone (0.5° cone angle) mounted onto a culture dish, as described previously (20Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Du J. Jo H. J. Biol.

Cells were lysed in a buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% TritonX-100, and 1% deoxycholate, pH 7.2) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Cell lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to obtain clear supernatants. Proteins were denatured in the Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C, electrophoresed on a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK). The membrane was incubated overnight with a primary antibody (1:1000 dilution) at 4 °C and then with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1:3000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The immunoreactive bands were detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed using the National Institutes of Health Image program. Mouse monoclonal antibodies for ASS1 and NOS3 were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies for Ser1177-phosphorylated NOS3 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) were from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Mouse monoclonal β-actin antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to HRP were purchased from Cell signaling and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), respectively. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCR was conducted using the GeneAmp® PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing Prime RT-PCR premix (GENETBIO, Nonsan, Korea), 250 ng of RNA, and 10 pmol of gene-specific primer sets (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea). The sequences of PCR primers were: ASS1 (GenBank accession number, NM_000050.4), 5′-TCC TGG AGA ACC CCA AGA AC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTC AGC AAA TTT CAA GCC CA-3′ (antisense); NOS3 (NM_000603.3), 5′-TGC TGG CAT ACA GGA CTC AG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TAG GTC TTG GGG TTG TCA GG-3′ (antisense); CAT1 (NM_003045.4), 5′-AAC TTA ATC CTC TCC TAC ATC ATC G-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCA TGA ATC CAC CAA CAC C-3′ (antisense); GAPDH (NM_002046.3), 5′-GCC AAA AGG GTC ATC ATC TC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTA GAG GCA GGG ATG ATG TTC-3′ (antisense). The PCR products were electrophoresed in a 1.0% agarose gel DNA ladder marker (ELPIS-BIOTECH, Daejeon, Korea). The gel was ethidium bromide-stained, and the band intensities were determined using a Gel Doc system (Bio-Rad). NO production from endothelial cells was determined by measuring NO metabolites, nitrite plus nitrate, accumulated in a culture medium as described previously (23Boo Y.C. Tressel S.L. Jo H. Nitric Oxide. 2007; 16: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). After cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich), with or without LSS at 12 dynes·cm−2 for 24 h, the conditioned medium was harvested for analysis. An aliquot (100 μl) of the conditioned medium was pretreated with a solution (100 μl) of 0.2 units·ml−1 nitrate reductase, 0.4 units·ml−1 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.25 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 0.2 μm NADPH in 14 mm Na-PO4 buffer (pH 7.4), to reduce nitrate to nitrite. After a 45-min incubation at room temperature, samples (50–100 μl) were added into 20 mm potassium iodide in 0.1 n sulfuric acid (10 ml) to convert nitrite to NO while monitoring the current change due to NO generation with an amperometric NO sensor (AmiNO700, Innovative Instruments, Inc., Tampa, FL). A calibration curve was generated using sodium nitrite. After LSS treatment or incubation at a static condition, endothelial cells were either stimulated with 4 ng·ml−1 tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) for 4 h or treated with a vehicle in a growth medium. Then, the growth medium was replaced by RPMI medium, and the fluorescence-labeled THP-1 cells suspended in RPMI medium were added at a 1:1 ratio. After co-incubation of endothelial cells and THP-1 cells for 1 h, non-adherent THP-1 cells were washed out with PBS twice. Fresh RPMI medium was supplied to the remaining cells. Florescence-labeled THP-1 cells adhering to the endothelial cell surface were observed with a Nikon eclipse TE2000-U microscope. For quantification, adherent cells were lysed in 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to obtain the supernatant. The fluorescence intensity of supernatants was determined at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and emission wavelength of 535 nm, using an LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and normalized for the number of endothelial cells. After HAECs were exposed to LSS and/or TNF-α, cell surface expression of VCAM-1 was determined by ELISA (24Khan B.V. Harrison D.G. Olbrych M.T. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 9114-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 0.1% BSA in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were incubated with goat polyclonal VCAM-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:300 overnight at 4 °C followed by a 1-h incubation with donkey anti-goat antibody conjugated to HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:1000. Then, cells were washed with PBS twice and treated with a substrate for HRP, 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine from Sigma-Aldrich. The reaction was stopped with 2 n HCl, forming a yellow reaction product. The colorimetric conversion at 450 nm of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl benzidine was determined with a Bio-Rad Model 680 microplate reader. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. of experiments performed in triplicate. Significant differences among the groups were determined using the one-way analysis of variance. The Duncan's multiple range test was conducted if differences were identified between the groups at a significance level of p < 0.05. Endothelial NO production should be governed by the enzyme activity of NOS3 and the supply of its substrate, l-arginine. To confirm the critical role of ASS1 in the intracellular l-arginine supply to NOS3 enzyme, it was first determined whether the increased expression of ASS1 can increase NO production. As shown in Fig. 1A, transfection of HUVECs with a plasmid construct encoding ASS1 (pcDNA-ASS1) increased protein levels of ASS1. The NO production was much higher in cells transfected with pcDNA-ASS1 as compared with those transfected with an empty vector (pcDNA). Transfection of cells with pcDNA-ASS1 did not alter NOS3 protein level nor the phosphorylation of Ser1177 of NOS3 (Fig. 1A), which is known as one of the major mechanisms leading to the activation of the enzyme (11Boo Y.C. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C499-C508Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). If NO is inhibitory against monocyte adhesion, as has been reported previously (10Tsao P.S. Buitrago R. Chan J.R. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), ASS1, which increased NO production, should be able to inhibit monocyte adhesion. Supporting this notion, TNF-α-stimulated monocyte adhesion was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing ASS1 (Fig. 1B). As expected, transfection of cells with a plasmid construct encoding NOS3 (pcDNA-NOS3) resulted in an increase of NOS3 protein level, an increase of NO production, and a decrease of monocyte adhesion, providing a positive control (Fig. 1, A and B). Both pcDNA-ASS1 and pcDNA-NOS3 tended to decrease the basal monocyte adhesion in the absence of TNF-α, although the changes were not statistically significant (Fig. 1B). Because the overexpression of ASS1 resulted in an increase of NO production and a decrease of monocyte adhesion, it was further tested whether these two consequences are related to each other. If ASS1 inhibited monocyte adhesion through enhancing NO production, this effect of ASS1 should be dependent on the expression of NOS3. To verify this notion, cells were co-transfected with the pcDNA-ASS1 or pcDNA vector in combination with a negative control oligoribonucleotide duplex (NC) or ASS1 siRNA or NOS3 siRNA (Fig. 2). HUVECs are one of the cells that are difficult to transfect with long nucleic acids, and thus, co-transfection conditions were optimized for plasmid constructs but not for siRNAs. As shown in Fig. 2, endogenous NOS3 was decreased by NOS3 siRNA but not fully knocked down, probably because the transfection conditions might not be optimal for siRNAs. However, the expression of ASS1, mainly of exogenous form, in the transfected cells was effectively suppressed by co-transfected ASS1 siRNA. In this Western blotting condition, the change of ASS1 expression levels in the control cells transfected with the pcDNA vector could not be definitively monitored. ASS1 siRNA increased both basal and TNF-α-stimulated monocyte adhesion significantly in cells transfected with the pcDNA-ASS1 or pcDNA vector, indicating that the changes of the ASS1 protein level could influence on monocyte adhesion (Fig. 2). The effects of NOS3 siRNA were also of interest because they increased monocyte adhesion in both cells; the increase of monocyte adhesion by NOS3 siRNA was reduced by ASS1 overexpression, and the decrease of monocyte adhesion by overexpressed ASS1 was reduced by NOS3 siRNA (Fig. 2). These results indicated that NOS3 might be required for the inhibitory action of ASS1 on monocyte adhesion and vice versa. The importance of ASS1 in endothelial NO production was further examined under LSS conditions. HAECs were chosen for this experimental purpose because they are normally exposed to a high level of LSS in vivo. As shown in Fig. 3A, chronic LSS (12 dynes·cm−2 for 24 h) increased the mRNA levels of ASS1 and NOS3 in HAECs, but these changes were significantly inhibited in cells pretreated with their siRNAs. The protein levels of ASS1 and NOS3 were also significantly increased by LSS (Fig. 3B) and decreased by siRNAs of ASS1 and NOS3, respectively. LSS increased the phosphorylation of Ser1177 of NOS3 as expected, and phosphorylation was not affected by ASS1 siRNA (Fig. 3B). Of course, the phosphorylated form of NOS3 was not detected in NOS3-depleted cells. The mRNA and protein levels of CAT1 were also examined because this protein is known to be involved in the transport of l-arginine (25McDonald K.K. Zharikov S. Block E.R. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31213-31216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The results showed that its mRNA and protein levels were unaltered by the exposure to LSS or the treatments with siRNA of NOS3 or ASS1 (Fig. 3, A and B). LSS also increased NO production by 2-fold in the NC-treated cells (Fig. 3C). However, pretreatment of cells with either ASS1 siRNA or NOS3 siRNA reduced the NO production levels by half under both static and LSS conditions (Fig. 3C). These results indicated that ASS1 actively participates in the regulation of endothelial NO production in response to LSS by providing l-arginine to NOS3. Potentially ASS1 could supply l-arginine to other NOS enzymes including NOS2. However, NOS2 protein could not be detected in HAECs under static and LSS conditions (Fig. 3B). In contrast, NOS2 protein was clearly detected in THP-1 cells stimulated with TNF-α (Fig. 3B). Thus, it was indicated that ASS1 may not be functionally associated with NOS2 in the endothelial cells. It was then examined whether ASS1 contributes to the inhibition of monocyte adhesion by LSS. HAECs were pretreated with ASS1 or NOS3 siRNA (25 nm), exposed to LSS (12 dynes·cm−2), and stimulated with TNF-α (4 ng·ml−1) prior to co-incubation with the fluorescence-labeled monocytes. The experiments included several lines of control cells treated with NC instead of a siRNA, those without LSS exposure, and those without TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, exposure of HAECs to LSS decreased monocyte adhesion in the absence and presence of TNF-α. In addition, these changes were abrogated by ASS1 siRNA as well as NOS3 siRNA. These results indicated that the expression of NOS3 and ASS1 is a necessary condition for inhibition of monocyte adhesion. The effects of NOS3 and ASS1 siRNAs on the cell surface expression of VCAM-1 were also examined because this cell adhesion molecule is known to be most consistently down-regulated by LSS and NO (10Tsao P.S. Buitrago R. Chan J.R. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 24Khan B.V. Harrison D.G. Olbrych M.T. Alexander R.W. Medford R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 9114-9119Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The results showed that LSS decreased the cell surface expression of VCAM-1 in endothelial cells in the absence and presence of TNF-α (Fig. 4C). Of special interest, VCAM-1 expression in LSS-exposed cells was maintained high if the cells were pretreated with siRNA of ASS1 or NOS3 (Fig. 4C). The inhibitory action of LSS on monocyte binding, an initial event involved in the development of atherosclerosis, has been attributed to NO, which inhibits the gene expression of certain adhesion molecules (10Tsao P.S. Buitrago R. Chan J.R. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 1682-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Chronic LSS is known to increase endothelial NO production through the up-regulation of NOS3 protein expression and activity (11Boo Y.C. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: C499-C508Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). By providing evidence that the ASS1 expression is required for the increase of NO production and the inhibition of monocyte adhesion by LSS (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), the current study established a sequential event occurring in response to LSS: LSS → increase of ASS1 → increase of NO production by NOS3 → suppression of cell surface expression of VCAM-1 → inhibition of monocyte adhesion. The current study also demonstrated that overexpression of ASS1 alone led to an increase of NO production without altering NOS3 protein expression or phosphorylation (Fig. 1A) and a decrease of monocyte adhesion (Fig. 1B). The latter effect of ASS1 was quite dependent on the presence of NOS3 (Fig. 2). Also, NOS2 was not induced by LSS in HAECs (Fig. 3) Therefore, ASS1 is considered to be functionally associated with NOS3, providing an effective way to improve vascular health. If l-arginine is not sufficiently provided, NOS3 reaction might be uncoupled to produce reactive oxygen species instead of NO. This notion has been experimentally demonstrated in a previous study using HEK 293 cells stably transfected with rat neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1) and stimulated with a calcium ionophore (26Xia Y. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Zweier J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 6770-6774Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In the present study, the possibility of NOS3 uncoupling was examined by monitoring intracellular reactive oxygen species production with an oxidant-sensitive probe, dihydrorhodamine 123 (15Mun G.I.

The results indicated that reactive oxygen species formation in cultured HAECs was not significantly altered by LSS or ASS1 siRNA treatments (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, it was considered that limited l-arginine supply might not cause significant NOS3 uncoupling in normal cells unless they were stimulated to a supraphysiological level. Although normal levels of l-arginine in endothelial cells (>800 μm) (28Baydoun A.R. Emery P.W. Pearson J.D. Mann G.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopu"
https://openalex.org/W2054627945,"Macrophage foam cell is the predominant cell type in atherosclerotic lesions. Removal of excess cholesterol from macrophages thus offers effective protection against atherosclerosis. Here we report that a protein kinase A (PKA)-anchoring inhibitor, st-Ht31, induces robust cholesterol/phospholipid efflux, and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) greatly facilitates this process. Remarkably, we found that st-Ht31 completely reverses foam cell formation, and this process is ABCA1-dependent. The reversal is also accompanied by the restoration of well modulated inflammatory response to LPS. There is no detectable toxicity associated with st-Ht31, even when cells export up to 20% cellular cholesterol per hour. Using FRET-based PKA biosensors in live cells, we provide evidence that st-Ht31 drives cholesterol efflux by elevating PKA activity specifically in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, ABCA1 facilitates st-Ht31 uptake. This allows st-Ht31 to effectively remove cholesterol from ABCA1-expressing cells. We speculate that de-anchoring of PKA offers a novel therapeutic strategy to remove excess cholesterol from lipid-laden lesion macrophages."

TGFβ can activate p38 through two distinct pathways. The first pathway involves GADD45, a Smad4-induced gene, which activates the upstream p38 activator MTK1 (12Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 13Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Liebermann D.A.

Biol. 2007; 27: 2765-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The second pathway does not directly involve the Smads but instead involves TGFβ-induced activation of the upstream p38 activator TAK1 (TGFβ-activated kinase 1) by the ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 (11Sorrentino A. Thakur N. Grimsby S. Marcusson A. von Bulow V. Schuster N. Zhang S. Heldin C.H. Landström M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1199-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 15Yamashita M. Fatyol K. Jin C. Wang X. Liu Z. Zhang Y.E. Mol. Cell. 2008; 31: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Whether the two mechanisms described leading to p38 activation interact or are completely independent of each other, remains to be explored in greater detail. In contrast to the mechanistic detail available describing how TGFβ induces p38 activation, less is known about the downstream p38 substrates that mediate cell death (16Sánchez-Capelo A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 15-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cell death can be initiated by permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which allows soluble proteins such as cytochrome c to diffuse from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space to the cytosol (17Chipuk J.E. Moldoveanu T. Llambi F. Parsons M.J. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c interacts with apoptotic protease activating factor-1 to form a caspase activating complex. Activated caspases subsequently cleave various cellular substrates, a process which ultimately results in cell death. Permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane is controlled by the BCL-2 family, which includes anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic members. Anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins contain four BCL-2 homology (BH) domains and they preserve mitochondrial membrane integrity by directly inhibiting pro-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins (17Chipuk J.E. Moldoveanu T. Llambi F. Parsons M.J. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Pro-apoptotic BCL-2 members can be classified into effector proteins and BH3 domain-only proteins. The effector proteins Bax and Bak homo-oligomerize upon activation and fuse with the mitochondrial outer membrane to induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. BH3-only proteins that are able to interact only with the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members are referred to as sensitizers or derepressors (and include BAD and Noxa). Bim and Bid are able to interact with the antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins as well as the effector proteins, and can directly activate Bax and Bak, which are referred to as direct activators. BH3-only proteins can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. TGFβ is well known to act on a cell type- and physiological context-dependent manner in exerting its biological effects (2Heldin C.H. Landström M. Moustakas A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). With respect to the apoptotic response, TGFβ has been described to induce cell death through the BH3-only direct activator Bim in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner (18Ramjaun A.R. Tomlinson S. Eddaoudi A. Downward J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Others have shown that TGFβ-ERK1/2 MAPK-induced phosphorylation (and thus inactivation) of Bad, results in neuroprotection (19Zhu Y. Yang G.Y. Ahlemeyer B. Pang L. Che X.M. Culmsee C. Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3898-3909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Possibly TGFβ has the potential to alter the balance between the anti-apoptotic and the BH3-only BCL-2 family members depending on the cellular context. Here we describe mitogen- and stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1) as a novel factor regulating TGFβ-p38-dependent cell death. MSK1 is a multifunctional kinase that may function as an effector of ERK1/ERK2 or p38 MAPK in TGFβ signaling (20Abécassis L. Rogier E. Vazquez A. Atfi A. Bourgeade M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30474-30479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). MSK1 is an 85 kDa nuclear protein closely related to the RSK family of protein kinases. MSK1 contains two separate kinase domains within a single polypeptide (21Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Both N- and C-terminal kinase domains are required for full MSK1 activity. The molecular mechanism of MSK1 activation is complex and requires multi-site phosphorylation events by upstream kinases followed by autophosphorylation (21Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 22McCoy C.E. Campbell D.G. Deak M. Bloomberg G.B. Arthur J.S. Biochem.

We found that TGFβ can induce MSK1 activity in a p38-dependent manner, which in turn requires the mobilization of Smad4 and transcriptional induction of GADD45. We then present evidence that MSK1 unexpectedly plays a pro-survival role as its knockdown potentiated the activation of caspase 3, reduced Bad phosphorylation, and increased Noxa and Bim expression. With MSK1 we have identified a pro-survival kinase downstream of the p38 pathway that attenuates the extent of TGFβ-p38-induced cell death. All inhibitors were from Biomol (Hamburg Germany), except Gö6976 and Gö6983, which were from Calbiochem, PD184352 was a kind gift from J. Lennartson.

Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Dharmafect reagent 1 (Dharmacon). For transient overexpression of GADD45, plasmids were transfected and 24 h thereafter cells were selected overnight with 5 μg/ml puromycin. For siRNA transfection (MSK1 on-target Plus Smartpool, Smad4 on-target Smartpool from Dharmacon), cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA. Cells were rinsed with ice-cold PBS before lysis in sample buffer. Samples were sonicated 3 × 30 s before boiling. Samples were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a mini-gel system according to manufactures protocol (Bio-Rad) and transferred overnight to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Transfer efficiency was checked using Ponceau-S. Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before detection with West-Dura Nano ECL substrate and Biomax films. Experiments were confirmed multiple times. Representative results out of at least three independent repeats are shown. Amount of viable cells was determined using an MTS assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Promega, Leiden, The Netherlands). Cells were serum-starved overnight before stimulation with TGFβ. After MTS detection cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS and visualized using phase contrast microscopy. Digital images were adjusted for brightness and contrast. Experiments were performed in 5-fold and repeated at least four times. NMuMG cells were treated as indicated in figures before extraction of RNA using RNeasy (Qiagen). Analysis of mRNA expression was performed as described earlier (31Kowanetz M. Lönn P. Vanlandewijck M.

The PCR primers used were: mouse MSK1, forward, 5′-AGCCACATGCACGATGTAGGA-3′, reverse, 5′-AGGCGTGCAAACCCAAAGT-3′; mouse TBP, forward, 5′-CCGCAGTGCCCAGCATCACT-3′, reverse, 5′-TGGGGAGGCCAAGCCCTGAG-3′; mouse Noxa, forward, 5′-ATAACTGTGGTTCTGGCGCAG-3′, reverse, 5′-TTGAGCACACTCGTCCTTCAA-3′; mouse Bim, forward, 5′-GTCCCGGTCCTCCAGTGGGT-3′, reverse, 5′-CGCAGCTCCTGTGCAATCCG-3′. MSK1 can respond to both mitogen- and stress-induced MAPK pathways (21Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Because TGFβ can activate the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways in mouse breast epithelial NMuMG cells (7Lee M.K. Pardoux C. Hall M.C. Lee P.S. Warburton D. Qing J. Smith S.M. Derynck R.

Chytil A.M. Brown K.A. Aakre M.E. Moses H.L. Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 603-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), we investigated whether MSK1 is activated in this cell line. To establish the kinetics of MSK1 phosphorylation, NMuMG cells were stimulated with TGFβ for 0.5 up to 8 h (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, cell lysates were analyzed for MSK1 phosphorylation on residues Ser-376 and Thr-581. Phosphorylation of both Ser-376 and Thr-581 is required for MSK1 catalytic activity (22McCoy C.E.

MSK1 phosphorylation remained unchanged after 0.5 h of TGFβ stimulation but increased dramatically after 1 h. After 4 h, phosphorylation of both Ser-376 and Thr-581 diminished and thereafter remained constant at lower levels for up to 8 h. CREB and RelA are two transcription factors described to be downstream substrates of MSK1 in other cell types (21Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq L.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 24Arthur J.S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 27Wiggin G.R. Soloaga A. Foster J.M. Murray-Tait V. Cohen P. Arthur J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2871-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Indeed, TGFβ induced the phosphorylation of CREB and RelA in a similar time frame as it induced the phosphorylation of MSK1 (Fig. 1B) suggesting that MSK1 may also regulate CREB and RelA in our cell model. The antibody used to detect phospho-CREB recognized two protein bands, the lower band is phospho-ATF1, whereas the upper band is phospho-CREB (see “Experimental Procedures”). To confirm that the kinase activity of MSK1 is required for the phosphorylation of CREB and RelA in response to TGFβ, we preincubated NMuMG cells with different kinase inhibitors prior to TGFβ treatment. The inhibitors target several kinases, but all have in common that they potently inhibit MSK1 (Table 1) (33Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). The PKC inhibitor Gö6983, which does not act on MSK1, was used as a negative control, and did not prevent TGFβ-induced CREB phosphorylation, but consistently resulted in a slight increase in the phosphorylation of CREB and ATF1 (Fig. 1C). The inhibitors Gö6976 and Ro 31–8220 inhibited CREB phosphorylation. Because Gö6976 and Ro 31–8220, but not Gö6983 inhibit CREB phosphorylation, it is likely that MSK1 acts as the upstream CREB and RelA kinase.TABLE 1Inhibitors used in this study and their targetInhibitorTargetSB202190p38SB203580p38Ro 31–8220MSK1/PKCGö-6976MSK1/PKCGö-6983PKCPD184352MEK1/2PD98059MEK1/2UO126MEK1/2 Open table in a new tab Having established that MSK1 is activated in response to TGFβ, we focused on the upstream pathway. It has been described that in certain cell types MSK1 is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 and p38. Therefore, we preincubated NMuMG cells with specific inhibitors to MEK1/2 and p38 prior to TGFβ stimulation. Two MEK1/2 inhibitors, UO126 or PD98059 both failed to prevent CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). An additional MEK1/2 inhibitor PD184352 also did not prevent CREB phosphorylation nor did it prevent MSK1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). However, application of the p38 inhibitors SB202190 or SB203580 completely inhibited phosphorylation of CREB (Fig. 2A). SB202190 also prevented phosphorylation of MSK1 (Fig. 2C, SB203580 not shown). Phosphorylated Smad2 was included as a control and was not affected by these inhibitors as expected, whereas total p38 and CREB were used as controls to determine equal sample loading (Fig. 2A). These results suggest that p38 MAPK, but not ERK1/ERK2, plays a prominent role upstream of the MSK1 kinase in response to TGFβ stimulation. TGFβ-induced p38 activity has been described to depend on either Smad4-mediated transcription or TAK1 activity (11Sorrentino A. Thakur N. Grimsby S. Marcusson A. von Bulow V. Schuster N. Zhang S.

Cell. 2008; 31: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Therefore we knocked down either TAK1 or Smad4 and tested the ability of TGFβ to induce p38 phosphorylation. Transient knockdown of TAK1 with siRNA did not influence TGFβ-induced p38 or CREB phosphorylation (Fig. 3A), suggesting that they are activated in a TAK1-independent manner. To determine if p38-MSK1-CREB signaling requires Smad4, we analyzed NMuMG cells which stably express a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against Smad4. Treatment of these cells with TGFβ resulted in a greatly reduced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, MSK1, and CREB. Smad4 knockdown had no effect on Smad2 phosphorylation, as expected, and indicating specificity toward the p38 pathway (Fig. 3B). Because Smad4 appears to be required for TGFβ-induced p38 activity, we presumed that a Smad4 target gene was required. One such candidate gene is Gadd45. We confirmed that all members of the Gadd45 gene family were expressed in NMuMG cells (supplemental Fig. S1) and were induced upon TGFβ treatment in a Smad4-dependent manner (data not shown). Knockdown of Gadd45 and subsequent TGFβ treatment significantly reduced TGFβ-induced p38 activity (Fig. 3C, knockdown efficiency supplemental Fig. S1), supporting a role for Gadd45 as a Smad4 target gene required for p38 activation. Because p38 activation by TGFβ is an important pathway leading to cell death, which has been previously described in NMuMG cells (18Ramjaun A.R. Tomlinson S. Eddaoudi A. Downward J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we analyzed the effect of MSK1 knockdown on TGFβ-induced cell death. To measure viable cell number we used an MTS cell viability assay whereby signal intensity is directly correlated to the amount of viable cells. In controls, TGFβ enhanced cell death by 2.5-fold, whereas in the MSK1 siRNA-treated samples cell death was enhanced by 8-fold (Fig. 4A). The fold-induction reaffirms previously published data showing that TGFβ treatment induced cell death by 3-fold in this cell model (18Ramjaun A.R. Tomlinson S. Eddaoudi A. Downward J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The results obtained on cell survival were also confirmed by microscopic inspection of cell numbers following formaldehyde fixation (Fig. 4B). The potentiation of TGFβ-induced cell death after MSK1 knockdown can be observed by the low amount of surviving cells after TGFβ treatment. As a molecular corollary of cell death induced by TGFβ, we examined the total levels of active caspase 3, the total levels of Bad and of phosphorylated Bad on Ser-112, Ser-136, and Ser-155, as potential mediators of cell death (Fig. 4C). After 8 h of TGFβ treatment there was clearly an increase in the amount of cleaved caspase 3 (the antibody used is directed toward the active caspase 3 fragment). Although Bad phosphorylation appeared to be weakly induced, the total levels of the Bad protein were reduced upon stimulation with TGFβ. Total p38 levels were provided as a control to indicate equal loading and are not affected by TGFβ. The specific decrease in total Bad levels may reflect its cleavage by caspases and degradation as has been reported earlier (34Kim B.C. Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cleavage of Bad should result in a Bad fragment which is extremely potent at inducing cell death. Unfortunately, the Bad antibody did not appear to recognize this cleaved Bad form. In agreement with the cell viability data of Fig. 4A, knockdown of MSK1 enhanced cleaved caspase 3 and further reduced Bad levels (Fig. 4C). Because TGFβ affected Bad at the post-translational level we screened for other BCL-2 members at the transcriptional level and examined the effect of MSK1 knockdown on these transcripts. Both Noxa and Bim expression levels were increased after MSK1 knockdown, whereas only Bim expression was augmented after TGFβ stimulation (Fig. 5). In summary, MSK1 knockdown increases cell death presumably by decreasing Bad phosphorylation, increasing Noxa and Bim transcription and enhancing caspase 3 cleavage. To gain more mechanistic insight into the role of MSK1 in TGFβ-induced cell death, we examined the role of its upstream regulators, Smad4 and p38. Transient Smad4 knock-down with siRNA revealed that TGFβ-induced cell death completely depended on the presence of Smad4 (Fig. 6A). Because p38 activity has been described to be crucial for TGFβ-induced cell death to occur, and MSK1 knockdown potentiates cell death instead of inhibiting it, we speculated that MSK1 inhibits a second pathway downstream of p38. To test this hypothesis we knocked down MSK1 and inhibited p38 with either SB202190 or SB203580 (Fig. 6B, SB203580 supplemental Fig. S2). Both p38 inhibitors prevented the potentiation of cell death induced by MSK1 knockdown, indicating that MSK1 counteracts a pro-apoptotic p38 pathway. Because p38 inhibition prevented cell death, we examined if the transcripts of Bim and Noxa were influenced by SB202190. Incubation of cells with SB202190 indeed reduced the transcript levels of Noxa (Fig. 6C), but not Bim (data not shown). SB202190 effectively reduced the enhanced expression of Noxa observed when MSK1 was knocked down, indicating that some BH3-only BCL-2 members are potentially sensitive to p38 inhibition. Because MSK1 appeared to provide the cell with a survival signal we investigated if specific growth factors could compensate for the loss of MSK1. We first tested the effect of EGF, insulin and bFGF on caspase 3 cleavage. Co-stimulation of TGFβ and EGF prevented caspase 3 cleavage (Fig. 7A) as did co-stimulation of TGFβ and insulin. bFGF did not prevent the induction of caspase 3 by TGFβ, despite the ability of bFGF to activate signaling in NMuMG cells (35Reiland J. Rapraeger A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, we established that overnight incubation of cells with insulin or EGF slightly inhibited TGFβ-induced cell death (Fig. 7B and supplemental Fig. S3). Notably the effect of EGF and insulin on caspase 3 was measured after 4 h, considerably shorter than the time frame of the cell death assay (24 h). As observed before, knockdown of MSK1 potentiated TGFβ-induced cell death by 2-fold. Insulin and TGFβ co-stimulation resulted in a decrease of cell death, but insulin could not fully rescue the effect of MSK1 knockdown (supplemental Fig. S3). In contrast to insulin, EGF could fully rescue the effect of MSK1 knockdown on cell death as EGF application restored the amount of cell death to control levels. As we had observed a reduction in Bad phosphorylation and an increase in the transcript expression of Noxa and Bim after MSK1 knockdown, we investigated if EGF supplementation could revert this. Indeed EGF treatment resulted in a phosphorylation of Bad on Ser-112, Ser-136, and Ser-155. After MSK1 knockdown Bad phosphorylation on Ser-136 was reduced as observed before (Fig. 7C), but EGF fully restored phosphorylation on all phosphorylation sites. Additionally, EGF supplementation slightly repressed transcript levels of Bim and Noxa in control conditions and reversed the increases observed when MSK1 was knocked down (Fig. 8, A and B). These experiments show that EGF provides specific pro-survival signals that counteract the pro-apoptotic branch of the TGFβ pathway. They also establish new dynamic means by which the cellular response to TGFβ leading to cell death can be modulated by physiological stimuli within the cellular microenvironment. TGFβ-induced p38 MAPK activity has been shown to induce cell death, however, the downstream components linking p38 MAPK to the cell death machinery remain unclear. In addition, the upstream pathway that links TGFβ to the activation of p38 MAPK has so far appeared to be cell type-dependent, thus necessitating a careful examination of this mechanism. Here we demonstrate that the p38-activated kinase MSK1 modulates the extent of TGFβ-induced cell death by negatively regulating p38-dependent cell death, possibly by regulating the pro-apoptotic BH3-only members of the BCL-2 family (Fig. 8C). Additionally, with MSK1 we have identified a pro-survival kinase downstream of p38 MAPK, which is often considered pro-apoptotic. This novel role of MSK1 acting downstream of the TGFβ-p38 MAPK signaling branch provides an interesting nodal point that may explain mechanistically some of the context-dependent effects of TGFβ and the ability of different cell types to respond differentially to the pro-apoptotic signals of this cytokine. Overall, MSK1 appears to be an important hub in TGFβ signaling and a crucial component in controlling the extent of TGFβ-induced cell death. An important issue in TGFβ signaling is non-Smad versus Smad-dependent signaling (2Heldin C.H. Landström M. Moustakas A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of Smad4 (Smad-dependent) and TAK1 (non-Smad) in p38-MSK1 signaling, we investigated MSK1 signaling in cells where either Smad4 or TAK1 were silenced, and obtained evidence for a requirement for Smad4 in p38 activation (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, it has been shown that p38 MAPK activation by TGFβ in NMuMG cells does not require Smad activation (9Yu L. Hébert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). This was shown by over-expressing a catalytically active mutant of the TGFβ type I receptor that does not bind Smads, but does retain its intrinsic kinase activity. Overexpression of this mutant receptor induced p38 MAPK activation and cell death in NMuMG cells, but it did not induce other physiological responses to TGFβ, such as epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Our results are in apparent contradiction to these earlier findings, but may be explained in three ways. First, overexpression of the mutant TGFβ receptor that has both constitutive kinase activity and lacks the binding site for Smad2 and Smad3, may direct endogenous signaling components toward a predominant pathway (e.g. p38 MAPK) bypassing the physiological capacity of endogenous wild-type receptors to activate multiple pathways. Second, Smad4 may act as a scaffold in the activation of p38 MAPK, without the requirement of Smad4 transcriptional activity. And thirdly, Smad4 may regulate a target or scaffold gene essential for TGFβ-induced p38 MAPK activity. The latter two options do not completely contradict the results obtained with the mutant type I receptor, because Smad4 was still present in those cells (9Yu L. Hébert M.C. Zhang Y.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3749-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that rapid (within minutes) activation of p38 MAPK by TGFβ is a TAK1-dependent process, whereas delayed (hours) p38 MAPK activation is Smad-dependent, as it has been shown to depend on the Smad4-mediated induction of GADD45β (12Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). GADD45β subsequently binds to and activates the MAP kinase kinase MTK1, which functions as an upstream activator of p38 MAPK. The activation of MTK1 by GADD45β appears to be specific since other potential upstream activators of p38 MAPK, such as TAK1 or ASK, are not activated by GADD45β (12Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). C-terminal truncation mutants of Smad4, as well as antisense GADD45β could prevent activation of p38 MAPK by TGFβ, consistent with the requirement of Smad-dependent transcription in p38 MAPK activation (12Takekawa M. Tatebayashi K. Itoh F. Adachi M. Imai K. Saito H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6473-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Because the induction of p38-MSK1 and CREB depended on the presence of Smad4 (Fig. 3B), we tested the requirement of GADD45 for the first time in our system. Consistent with a role of GADD45 during TGFβ-induced p38 activation, p38 phosphorylation was greatly reduced by GADD45 knockdown (Fig. 3C). Thus, the Smad4 dependence for p38 activation is explained by the Smad4-dependent induction of GADD45. This mechanism is fully compatible with the time frame of p38-MSK1 activation by TGFβ, which requires ∼1 h of signaling instead of a few minutes (Fig. 1A). The delayed activation of p38 MAPK by TGFβ-induced GADD45 has been mainly linked to the induction of cell death. Knockdown of GADD45 prevents the TGFβ-induced increase in cell death, whereas overexpression of GADD45 itself is enough to induce p38 MAPK activation and cell death (13Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Liebermann D.A. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43001-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). GADD45 knock-out cells display deficient p38 MAPK activation and diminished cell death in response to TGFβ treatment (13Yoo J. Ghiassi M. Jirmanova L. Balliet A.G. Hoffman B. Fornace Jr., A.J. Liebermann D.A. Bottinger E.P. Roberts A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 43001-43007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, knockdown of MSK1 and subsequent stimulation with TGFβ resulted in a dramatic loss of viable cells and this was accompanied by an increase in active caspase 3 (Fig. 4). We examined a second parameter involved in cell death by measuring total levels and phosphorylation of Bad (Fig. 4C). Phosphorylated Bad is sequestered in the cytoplasm by 14-3-3 proteins, whereas de-phosphorylation of Bad results in its translocation to mitochondria where it inactivates the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-XL and Bcl-2. However, we observed that the total levels of Bad decreased upon TGFβ treatment and this was further potentiated upon knockdown of MSK1. Possibly, TGFβ induces caspase-dependent cleavage of Bad, resulting in a truncated version as has been described (34Kim B.C. Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Notably, overexpression of the truncated Bad protein enhanced TGFβ-induced cell death, whereas a mutant Bad resistant to caspase 3 cleavage blocked TGFβ-induced cell death (34Kim B.C. Mamura M. Choi K.S. Calabretta B. Kim S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1369-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Therefore, the reduction of Bad protein and cell death may be directly linked to the increase observed in active caspase 3 levels. A third parameter we looked at is the transcriptional regulation of Noxa and Bim, which are, besides Bad, two additional pro-apoptotic BH3-only BCL-2 members. MSK1 knockdown significantly increased the transcript levels of both Noxa and Bim, whereas only Bim appeared to be sensitive to TGFβ (Fig. 5). Both Bad and Noxa only function as sensitizers/depressors of cell death (17Chipuk J.E. Moldoveanu T. Llambi F. Parsons M.J. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), therefore the transcriptional induction of Bim by TGFβ is of importance since this is a direct activator of apoptosis and may mediate in a more direct manner the TGFβ-dependent mechanism that establishes cell death in response to this cytokine. To establish how MSK1 influences TGFβ-induced cell death, we first addressed the roles of its upstream activators, Smad4 and p38, in this process. Knockdown of Smad4 eliminated all TGFβ-induced cell death endorsing the importance of Smad4-mediated transcription in this system (Fig. 6A). Inhibition of p38 with chemical inhibitors had small pro-survival effects on TGFβ-induced cell death, however, they effectively blocked the potentiation of cell death observed after MSK1 knockdown (Fig. 6B). Possibly some BH3-only members require p38 MAPK activity as levels of the Noxa transcript were significantly reduced upon chemical inhibition of p38 MAPK (Fig. 5, bottom). Regulation of Bim and Bmf protein expression has been shown to require p38 MAPK activity, implying an important role for p38 MAPK in the activation/induction of pro-apoptotic BH3-only BCL-2 family members (18Ramjaun A.R. Tomlinson S. Eddaoudi A. Downward J. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 970-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because MSK1 itself is activated downstream of p38 and MSK1 knockdown potentiates p38-dependent cell death, MSK1 represents a bifurcating node downstream of p38, balancing the TGFβ response between survival and cell death. Both insulin and EGF are known stimulants of cellular survival as they are able to modulate intracellular survival pathways (36van der Heide L.P. Ramakers G.M. Smidt M.P. Prog. Neurobiol. 2006; 79: 205-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 37Rosfjord E.C. Dickson R.B. J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1999; 4: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, EGF stimulation could completely revert the effects observed after MSK1 knockdown, whereas insulin could not (Fig. 7, supplemental Fig. S3). EGF prevented caspase cleavage, restored Bad phosphorylation after MSK1 knockdown and reduced transcript levels of Noxa and Bim (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). EGF and TGFβ may converge on the same intracellular pathway. The effects of EGF also imply that in order to efficiently kill the cell, a combinatorial method targeting both MSK1 and EGF signaling is required. In summary, we describe MSK1 as an important modulator of TGFβ signaling downstream of Smad4-induced p38 activity (Fig. 8C). By demonstrating the role of MSK1 as an anti-apoptotic factor for the first time, we have identified a functional bifurcation downstream of p38. It will be of great interest to explore possible involvement of TGFβ-induced MSK1 activation in diseases caused by perturbed TGFβ signaling such as cancer. Targeting of both the MSK1 and the EGF pathway may be considered as a method to re-sensitize cancer cells to TGFβ-induced cell death.

Faouzi S. Karyakin A. Correia M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1897-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indeed, findings of our stationary chase analyses revealed that CYP3A4 was markedly stabilized in the cdc48-2 yeast and even more strikingly so in the npl4-1 and ufd1-1 strains, relative to that in their wild type counterparts (19Liao M. Faouzi S. Karyakin A. Correia M.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 1897-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These results provided the initial clue that despite its ER topology, strategically poised for imminent access to the 26 S proteasome, CYP3A4 ERAD in S. cerevisiae requires the yeast Cdc48p-Npl4p-Ufd1p chaperone complex. These findings led us to examine the role of p97 in cultured rat hepatocytes (14Faouzi S. Medzihradszky K.F. Hefner C. Maher J.J. Correia M.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 7793-7803Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings provided evidence of a strong association between the native CYP3A and p97 that was significantly enhanced after mechanism-based CYP3A inactivation by the suicide inactivator, 3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-4-ethyl-1,4-dihydropyridine (DDEP). DDEP, in the course of its CYP3A-catalyzed oxidation, results in the oxidative fragmentation of the CYP3A prosthetic heme into mono- and dipyrrolic products that irreversibly bind to the active site of the enzyme (11Correia M.A. Decker C.

Maltby D. Yin H. Correia M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17448-17457Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), fatally damaging it both structurally and functionally. In vivo, this structurally damaged protein with active site lesions within its cytosolic domain is marked for rapid clearance via ERAD/UPD in a typical ERAD-C process.Given on one hand the imminent accessibility of CYPs 3A to the 26 S proteasome that renders p97 potentially dispensable in its ERAD and, on the other, this collective evidence in yeast and rat hepatocytes supporting a role for the p97 complex in CYP3A ERAD, we sought to determine the relative importance of the p97 complex to CYP3A ERAD/UPD through RNA interference (RNAi) targeted against p97. Our findings of p97 knockdown reveal that despite the predominantly cytosol-oriented ER topology of CYP3A, p97 plays a major role in CYP3A extraction into the cytosol and its subsequent delivery to the 26 S proteasome. Accordingly, p97 knockdown results in a strikingly marked accumulation of both the native and inactivated parent and ubiquitinated CYP3A species that remain firmly tethered to the ER membrane. Surprisingly, the native non-ubiquitinated CYP3A species accumulating in the ER on p97 knockdown is functionally active. This suggests that the p97 complex can regulate the hepatic content of the parent non-ubiquitinated CYP3A species and thus may critically influence its physiological function. Given the vast array of clinically relevant drugs, carcinogens, and other xenobiotics that depend on these particular P450s for their metabolic clearance (1Guengerich F.P. Ortiz de Montellano P. Cytochrome P450: Structure, Mechanism and Biochemistry. Kluwer-Academic/Plenum Press, New York2005: 377-530Google Scholar), our findings, if extrapolated to the human liver, would be clinically and/or toxicologically relevant.DISCUSSIONCollectively, our data suggest that despite the topological accessibility of ER-anchored CYPs 3A to the cytosolic 26 S proteasome, a functional p97 is essential for the extraction of both the native and DDEP-inactivated CYPs 3A from the ER membrane into the cytosol. This extraction entails the dislocation of the intact CYP3A proteins, including their N-terminal ER membrane signal anchor, into the cytosol. However, not all ERAD substrates require p97 for their extraction/retrotranslocation/delivery to the cytosol for their cellular turnover because some are efficiently extracted by the functionally similar AAA ATPases of the PA700 (19 S) proteasomal cap (75Wiertz E.J.

https://openalex.org/W2078234461,"Regulation of transcription requires cooperation between sequence-specific transcription factors and numerous coregulatory proteins. In IL-4/IL-13 signaling several coactivators for STAT6 have been identified, but the molecular mechanisms of STAT6-mediated gene transcription are still not fully understood. Here we identified by proteomic approach that the PTB-associated splicing factor (PSF) interacts with STAT6. In intact cells the interaction was observed only after IL-4 stimulation. The IL-4-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both STAT6 and PSF is a prerequisite for the efficient association of the two proteins. Functional analysis demonstrated that ectopic expression of PSF resulted in inhibition of STAT6-mediated transcriptional activation and mRNA expression of the Igε germline heavy chain gene, whereas knockdown of PSF increased the STAT6-mediated responses. PSF recruited histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) to the STAT6 transcription complex, which resulted in reduction of H3 acetylation at the promoter regions of Ig heavy chain germline Igε and inhibition of STAT6-mediated transcription. In addition, the HDACs inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) enhanced H3 acetylation, and reverted the PSF-mediated transcriptional repression of Igε gene transcription. In summary, these results identify PSF as a repressor of STAT6-mediated transcription that functions through recruitment of HDAC to the STAT6 transcription complex, and delineates a novel regulatory mechanism of IL-4 signaling that may have implications in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and pharmacological HDAC inhibition in lymphomas."

Because STAT5a and STAT5b differ mainly in the carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain, we sought to identify new proteins that bind specifically to this domain by using a bacterial two-hybrid screening. We isolated hTid1, a human DnaJ protein that acts as a tumor suppressor in various solid tumors. hTid1 interacts specifically with STAT5b but not with STAT5a in hematopoietic cell lines. This interaction involves the cysteine-rich region of the hTid1 DnaJ domain. We also demonstrated that hTid1 negatively regulates the expression and transcriptional activity of STAT5b and suppresses the growth of hematopoietic cells transformed by an oncogenic form of STAT5b. Our findings define hTid1 as a novel partner and negative regulator of STAT5b.

IntroductionSTAT transcription factors play a central role in cytokine-dependent survival, proliferation, and differentiation of a large spectrum of cells. Following cytokine addition, STAT proteins become tyrosine-phosphorylated and subsequently dimerize, forming homo- or heterodimers, and translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to specific elements in the promoter of target genes and activate transcription (1Leonard W.J. Int. J. Hematol. 2001; 73: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The STAT protein family comprises seven members, including the two closely related STAT5a and STAT5b molecules (2Liu X.

Mice in which stat5a and stat5b genes were deleted revealed redundant and specific functions of both proteins. stat5a−/− mice have a profound defect in mammary gland development and in prolactin response, whereas stat5b−/− mice display a defect in growth hormone response (4Liu X.

Besides the physiological role of STAT5 in hematopoietic cell development, there is increasing evidence suggesting that inappropriate activation of STAT5 may contribute to the development of leukemias and solid cancers (15Benekli M. Baer M.R. Baumann H. Wetzler M. Blood. 2003; 101: 2940-2954Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 16Tan S.H. Nevalainen M.T. Endocr. Relat.

The most direct evidence that constitutive activation of STAT5 is an important causative event in cell transformation came from the analysis of the STAT5 mutants, STAT5a1*6 and STAT5b1*6, and cS5F. These proteins with mutations at residues His299 → Arg and Ser711/716 → Phe (STAT5a1*6 or STAT5b1*6) or with the single mutation Ser711 → Phe (cS5F) possess constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation and are capable of inducing leukemias in mice (23Schwaller J.

In addition, STAT5b plays an important role in the proliferation and/or survival of tumor cells from head and neck cancer, glioblastomas, and prostate cancer (16Tan S.H. Nevalainen M.T. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2008; 15: 367-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Xi S. Zhang Q. Gooding W.E. Smithgall T.E. Grandis J.R.

Nevalainen M.T. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 1959-1972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). STAT5b acts downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor, which is frequently overexpressed or hyperactivated in these tumors (28Kloth M.T. Laughlin K.K. Biscardi J.S. Boerner J.L. Parsons S.J. Silva C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1671-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Furthermore, STAT5b is specifically activated in T-cell lymphomas transformed by the oncogenic fusion NPM1-ALK and contributes to the NPM1-ALK oncogenesis by promoting cell growth and survival, whereas STAT5a acts as a tumor suppressor in these malignant cells (29Zhang Q. Wang H.Y. Liu X. Wasik M.A. Nat. Med. 2007; 13: 1341-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). This suggests that STAT5a and STAT5b may have some non overlapping and opposite functions in the transformation of similar target cells.Like other STAT family members, STAT5a and STAT5b proteins contain in their carboxyl-terminal part a transactivation domain that is required for transcriptional activation (30Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jähne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In some early hematopoietic progenitors and in peripheral T cells, cleavage of full-length STAT5 proteins by proteases generates carboxyl-terminally truncated STAT5 proteins called STAT5γ that lack the transactivation domain and function as dominant negative proteins (3Buitenhuis M. Coffer P.J. Koenderman L. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis analyses have shown that a small amphipathic α-helical region within this domain is required not only for transcriptional activation of STAT5 proteins but also for the rapid proteasome-dependent turnover of the molecules (31Wang D. Moriggl R. Stravopodis D. Carpino N. Marine J.C. Teglund S. Feng J. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 392-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region is also involved in the recruitment of the cofactors CBP/P300 and NCoA1/SRC-1 (32Litterst C.M. Kliem S. Marilley D. Pfitzner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45340-45351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 33Pfitzner E. Jähne R. Wissler M. Stoecklin E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1582-1593Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, transcriptional activation and down-regulation of STAT5 proteins are mediated via a similar region located in the transactivation domain. STAT5a and STAT5b share 96% homology at the amino acid level and differ mainly in the carboxyl-terminal region. Importantly, a serine residue at position 779 that is phosphorylated in STAT5a is absent at a similar position in STAT5b (34Beuvink I. Hess D. Flotow H. Hofsteenge J. Groner B. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10247-10255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). There is evidence that STAT5b is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in the carboxyl terminus distinct from the residue Tyr699, which is necessary for STAT5b dimerization and activation (35Kloth M.T. Catling A.D. Silva C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8693-8701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Such phosphorylations may eventually affect STAT5b intracellular trafficking or interaction with cellular proteins (36Kazansky A.V. Rosen J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal regions of STAT5a and STAT5b may therefore confer distinct functions to these two molecules that might be related in part to interactions with distinct molecular partners. In this work, we aimed to identify new STAT5 transactivation domain-interacting proteins that could differentially regulate STAT5a or STAT5b activity. For this purpose, we used a bacterial two-hybrid screening approach. We have identified hTid1, a human DnaJ protein, homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Tid56, as a novel and specific negative regulator of STAT5b activity and expression in hematopoietic cell lines.DISCUSSIONSTAT Transcription Factors Are Important Mediators of Cytokine-induced Cell Survival and Proliferation. They transmit signals emanating from activated receptors to the nucleus in a rapid and transient manner (1Leonard W.J. Int. J. Hematol. 2001; 73: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). STAT activities are switched off subsequently by several and distinct negative regulatory mechanisms. These include the activities of phosphatases; inhibition by SOCS proteins (suppressors of cytokine signaling); interaction of inhibitory proteins, such as PIAS (protein inhibitor of activated STATs); and targeted proteasome-dependent degradation of active STATs (45Hilton D.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1568-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 46Kile B.T. Nicola N.A. Alexander W.S. Int. J.

For instance, it was shown that tyrosine dephosphorylation of STAT5 is induced by distinct tyrosine phosphatases like SHP-2, PTP1B, and LMW-PTP (48Yu C.L. Jin Y.J. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol.

Interestingly, The carboxyl-terminal region of Sat5 containing the transactivation domain is involved in the dephosphorylation induced by the phosphatase LMW-PTP (50Rigacci S. Talini D. Berti A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 312: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Similarly, nuclear ubiquitination and degradation of STAT5a by an as yet unidentified E3-ubiquitin ligase requires the α-amphipathic helix present in the transactivation domain of STAT5 (51Chen Y. Dai X. Haas A.L. Wen R. Wang D. Blood. 2006; 108: 566-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To identify specific binding of proteins to the carboxyl-terminal region of STAT5a and STAT5b, we used a bacterial two-hybrid screening and identified hTid1 as an interacting partner of STAT5b but not STAT5a. hTid1 has a high homology to Tid56, the protein encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster tumor suppressor gene l(2)tid (52Kaymer M. Debes A. Kress H. Kurzik-Dumke U. Gene. 1997; 204: 91-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Tid56 and hTid1 have 65.8 and 54.9% amino acid similarity and identity, respectively, and thus have been well conserved through evolution (53Yin X. Rozakis-Adcock M. Gene. 2001; 278: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Tid56 and hTid1 are members of the DnaJ chaperone protein family, which contains the J domain, a highly conserved domain that binds to Hsp70 molecular chaperones (54Cyr D.M. Langer T. Douglas M.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 176-181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The DnaJ-Hsp70 complexes are involved in protein folding, protein degradation, and the assembly or disassembly of multiprotein complexes. The htid1 gene encodes two spliced variants of hTid1, hTid1L and hTid1S, with opposite functions (40Syken J. De-Medina T. Münger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We showed in this study that both forms of hTid1 were able to interact with STAT5b in different murine and human hematopoietic cell lines and in COS cells co-expressing STAT5b and hTid1. Lu et al. (55Lu B. Garrido N. Spelbrink J.N. Suzuki C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13150-13158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported that only the long form of hTid1 interacts with STAT1 and STAT3 in the U2OS osteosarcoma cells. Our data showed that both forms of hTid1 interact with STAT1 but not STAT3 in hematopoietic cell lines. The reason for these discrepancies is not known, but they may be due to the requirement of an unidentified additional partner that is missing in some types of cells. In sharp contrast to STAT1, association of hTid1 isoforms with STAT5b is no longer detected following cell stimulation with cytokines. Phosphorylation of STAT5b on tyrosine residue Tyr699 was further shown to be involved in the dissociation of STAT5b from hTid1 upon cytokine stimulation. Nevertheless, we observed that hTid1 inhibits the transcriptional activity of STAT5b but not STAT5a in transfected COS cells, providing evidence for a specific and functional interaction between hTid1 and STAT5b. Importantly, we found evidence that hTid1 had the ability to inhibit the expression of STAT5b. Many studies have emphasized the important role of hTid1 in the regulation of stability and/or degradation of cellular proteins. For example, it was shown that hTid1 allowed the degradation of the transcription factor HIF1α by the Von Hippel-Lindau protein (43Bae M.K. Jeong J.W. Kim S.H. Kim S.Y. Kang H.J. Kim D.M. Bae S.K. Yun I. Trentin G.A. Rozakis-Adcock M. Kim K.W. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2520-2525Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Similarly, hTid1 may prolong the half-life of IκB kinases or act on the degradation of the receptor Erb2 in breast carcinoma cells (42Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Nelkin G. Tsan R. Fan D. Cheng-Mayer C. Fidler I.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 44-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 56Kim S.W. Chao T.H. Xiang R. Lo J.F. Campbell M.J. Fearns C. Lee J.D. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7732-7739Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable that hTid1 can regulate the stability/degradation of STAT5b. hTid1 interacts with the chaperone molecules Hsc70 and Hsp70 (40Syken J. De-Medina T. Münger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 55Lu B. Garrido N. Spelbrink J.N. Suzuki C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13150-13158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was previously shown that overexpression of Hsp70 protein in leukemic cells increases the expression of STAT5 (57Guo F. Sigua C. Bali P. George P. Fiskus W. Scuto A. Annavarapu S. Mouttaki A. Sondarva G. Wei S. Wu J. Djeu J. Bhalla K. Blood. 2005; 105: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that hTid1 may act on STAT5b expression via interaction with Hsp70, a hypothesis that awaits further experiments.Our mutagenesis experiments clearly demonstrated that the DnaJ cysteine-rich region of hTid1 is essential in the down-regulation of STAT5b expression and activity. This central cysteine-rich domain resembles a zinc finger structure and contains four repeats of the motif CXXCXGXG. Previous reports have shown that this region also interacts with the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus viral protein Tax and the transcription factor Smad7, a downstream signaling effector of BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) (58Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Shao Z. Vidal M. Parks W.P. Pagano M. Cheng-Mayer C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1771-1775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 59Torregroza I. Evans T. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, interaction with Smad7 was shown to alter the development of chicken embryos by inhibiting the signaling induced by BMP. Although the DnaJ cysteine-rich domain is essential for the hTid1/STAT5b interaction, we cannot rule out the contribution of the DnaJ domain amino terminus in regulating the expression of STAT5b because this domain plays a role in the targeted degradation of intracellular proteins, as has been observed for the IκB-IKK complex (42Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Nelkin G. Tsan R. Fan D. Cheng-Mayer C. Fidler I.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 44-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although the physiological function of hTid1 in hematopoietic cells remains currently poorly documented, our findings and published reports suggest that hTid1 may regulate the proliferation and/or survival of hematopoietic cells (60Syken J. Macian F. Agarwal S. Rao A. Münger K. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4636-4641Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Importantly, we showed that hTid1 can inhibit the growth of Ba/F3 cells transformed by an oncogenic STAT5b but not a STAT5a mutant. There is a body of evidence indicating that hTid1 plays an important role in apoptosis and/or cell proliferation in various cell types (38Edwards K.M. Münger K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8419-8431Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 40Syken J. De-Medina T. Münger K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8499-8504Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that hTid regulates apoptosis of glioma cells and suppresses growth of head and neck cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo (61Trentin G.A. He Y. Wu D.C. Tang D. Rozakis-Adcock M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 62Chen C.Y. Chiou S.H. Huang C.Y. Jan C.I. Lin S.C. Hu W.Y. Chou S.H. Liu C.J. Lo J.F. J. Pathol. 2009; 219: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in hTid1-mediated growth suppression remain elusive because hTid1 modulates the activity of many proteins involved in signal transduction and hence in the survival/apoptosis and/or cell proliferation. Indeed, hTid1 regulates the activity and/or stability of the tyrosine kinase JAK2, the IKK-IKβ complex, and therefore the activation of NFκB as well as the HIF1α transcription factor (42Cheng H. Cenciarelli C. Nelkin G. Tsan R. Fan D. Cheng-Mayer C. Fidler I.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 44-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 43Bae M.K. Jeong J.W. Kim S.H. Kim S.Y. Kang H.J.

Lewis A. Pestka S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49034-49042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, hTid1 interacts with the tumor suppressor APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) and regulates the activity of p53 by affecting its subcellular localization (64Qian J. Perchiniak E.M. Sun K. Groden J. Gastroenterology. 2010; 138: 1418-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 65Ahn B.Y. Trinh D.L. Zajchowski L.D. Lee B. Elwi A.N. Kim S.W. Oncogene. 2010; 29: 1155-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that hTid1 inhibits the growth of hematopoietic cell lines by interfering with the STAT5-dependent expression of genes involved in cell proliferation and survival, such as bcl-xL. Interestingly, several reports have shown that STAT5b but not STAT5a plays an important role in the proliferation and/or tumor invasion of glioblastoma multiforme cells and that constitutive activation of STAT5b contributes to squamous cell tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo (25Xi S. Zhang Q. Gooding W.E. Smithgall T.E. Grandis J.R. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 6763-6771PubMed Google Scholar, 26Liang Q.C. Xiong H. Zhao Z.W. Jia D. Li W.X. Qin H.Z. Deng J.P. Gao L. Zhang H. Gao G.D. Cancer Lett. 2009; 273: 164-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The apparent opposite effects of hTid1 in these two types of tumors suggest that hTid1 interferes with STAT5b activity in these neoplastic cells. In conclusion, our findings identified hTid1 as a new partner of STAT5b that has the ability to inhibit its transcriptional activity and its effects on hematopoietic cell growth. Whether hTid1 could suppress STAT5b-mediated cell transformation needs to be investigated. The finding that the 83 amino acids containing the DnaJ cysteine-rich region of hTid1 constitute the unique STAT5b-interacting domain opens interesting perspectives in the development of short peptides that could block the oncogenic activity of STAT5b. IntroductionSTAT transcription factors play a central role in cytokine-dependent survival, proliferation, and differentiation of a large spectrum of cells. Following cytokine addition, STAT proteins become tyrosine-phosphorylated and subsequently dimerize, forming homo- or heterodimers, and translocate into the nucleus, where they bind to specific elements in the promoter of target genes and activate transcription (1Leonard W.J. Int. J. Hematol. 2001; 73: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The STAT protein family comprises seven members, including the two closely related STAT5a and STAT5b molecules (2Liu X.

Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2120-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Mice in which stat5a and stat5b genes were deleted revealed redundant and specific functions of both proteins. stat5a−/− mice have a profound defect in mammary gland development and in prolactin response, whereas stat5b−/− mice display a defect in growth hormone response (4Liu X.

Simultaneous inactivation of stat5a/b genes demonstrated the requirement of both proteins in myeloid and lymphoid cell proliferation (6Teglund S. McKay C. Schuetz E. van Deursen J.M. Stravopodis D.

Indeed, erythroblasts, myeloid cells, mast cells, peripheral T cells, NK cells, and B cells display impaired proliferation and/or survival in mice lacking expression of STAT5 proteins (8Shelburne C.P.

https://openalex.org/W2020445133,"The DNA of every cell in the human body gets damaged more than 50,000 times a day. The most frequent damages are abasic sites. This kind of damage blocks proceeding DNA synthesis by several DNA polymerases that are involved in DNA replication and repair. The mechanistic basis for the incapability of these DNA polymerases to bypass abasic sites is not clarified. To gain insights into the mechanistic basis, we intended to identify amino acid residues that govern for the pausing of DNA polymerase β when incorporating a nucleotide opposite to abasic sites. Human DNA polymerase β was chosen because it is a well characterized DNA polymerase and serves as model enzyme for studies of DNA polymerase mechanisms. Moreover, it acts as the main gap-filling enzyme in base excision repair, and human tumor studies suggest a link between DNA polymerase β and cancer. In this study we employed high throughput screening of a library of more than 11,000 human DNA polymerase β variants. We identified two mutants that have increased ability to incorporate a nucleotide opposite to an abasic site. We found that the substitutions E232K and T233I promote incorporation opposite the lesion. In addition to this feature, the variants have an increased activity and a lower fidelity when processing nondamaged DNA. The mutations described in this work are located in well characterized regions but have not been reported before. A crystallographic structure of one of the mutants was obtained, providing structural insights."

Previous studies have demonstrated that SHERP localizes as a peripheral membrane protein on the cytosolic face of the endoplasmic reticulum and on outer mitochondrial membranes, whereas its high copy number suggests a critical function in vivo. However, the absence of defined domains or identifiable orthologues, together with lack of a clear phenotype in transgenic parasites lacking SHERP, has limited functional understanding of this protein. Here, we use a combination of biophysical and biochemical methods to demonstrate that SHERP can be induced to adopt a globular fold in the presence of anionic lipids or SDS. Cross-linking and binding studies suggest that SHERP has the potential to form a complex with the vacuolar type H(+)-ATPase. Taken together, these results suggest that SHERP may function in modulating cellular processes related to membrane organization and/or acidification during vector transmission of infective Leishmania."
