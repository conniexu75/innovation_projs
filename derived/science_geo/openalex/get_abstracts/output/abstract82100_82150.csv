https://openalex.org/W2042695720,"Infectious retroviruses have been detected in 22 of 45 randomly selected patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and in other individuals from San Francisco. The AIDS-associated retroviruses (ARV) studied in detail had a type D morphology, Mg2+-dependent reverse transcriptase, and cytopathic effects on lymphocytes. The viruses can be propagated in an established adult human T cell line, HUT-78. They cross-react with antiserum to the lymphadenopathy-associated retrovirus isolated from AIDS patients in France. Antibodies to ARV were found in all 86 AIDS patients and in a high percentage of 88 other homosexual men in San Francisco. This observation indicates the widespread presence of these lymphocytopathic retroviruses and their close association with AIDS."

https://openalex.org/W2048040148,"There is evidence that substance P is a peptide neurotransmitter of some unmyelinated primary afferent nociceptors and that its release from the peripheral terminals of primary afferent fibers mediates neurogenic inflammation. The investigators examined whether substance P also contributes to the severity of adjuvant-induced arthritis, an inflammatory disease in rats. They found that, in the rat, joints that developed more severe arthritis (ankles) were more densely innervated by substance P-containing primary afferent neurons than were joints that developed less severe arthritis (knees). Infusion of substance P into the knee increased the severity of arthritis; injection of a substance P receptor antagonist did not. These results suggest a significant physiological difference between joints that develop mild and severe arthritis and indicate that release of intraneuronal substance P in joints contributes to the severity of the arthritis."
https://openalex.org/W1965624710,"Synthetic oligonucleotide probes have been used to identify two overlapping cDNA clones that represent the entire coding region of the mRNA for the major intrinsic protein (MIP) of bovine lens cell membrane. Hybridization studies indicate that bovine MIP is encoded by a single-copy gene. The cDNA hybridizes to the rat genome, but MIP mRNA is not detected in rat liver. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence provides support for the potential role of MIP as a junctional protein. The structure predicted for MIP suggests that it traverses the lipid bilayer six times with both carboxy and amino termini on the cytoplasmic side, and that it has at least one amphiphilic transmembrane segment, as expected if the protein were to participate in the formation of an aqeous channel."

https://openalex.org/W2009103135,"The splicing of messenger RNA precursors in vitro proceeds through an intermediate that has the 5' end of the intervening sequence joined to a site near the 3' splice site. This lariat structure, which has been characterized for an adenovirus 2 major late transcript, has a branch point, with 2'-5' and 3'-5' phosphodiester bonds emanating from a single adenosine residue. The excised intervening sequence retains the branch site and terminates in a guanosine residue with a 3' hydroxyl group. The phosphate group at the splice junction between the two exons originates from the 3' splice site at the precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1528087101,"Guinea pig neutrophils were maintained for 4 h in culture medium containing [3H]arachidonic acid for the purpose of labeling cellular phospholipids. A short incubation of these cells with a chemotactic peptide resulted in rapid generation of superoxide anion, increased release of arachidonic acid (and small amounts of its metabolites) due to breakdown of phospholipids, and enhanced Ca2+ influx. These metabolic responses of cells to the chemotactic peptide were markedly suppressed when the cells had been exposed to islet-activating protein (IAP), pertussis toxin, during 4-h culture, as a result of ADP-ribosylation of a membrane Mr = 41,000 protein. This IAP-induced suppression was far greater than the maximal suppression observed with cellular cAMP increases; the action of IAP on neutrophils was not solely cAMP dependent. In contrast to the responses to the chemotactic peptide, similar responses of neutrophils to A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, were not affected by the prior treatment of the cells with IAP. It is proposed that in neutrophils the IAP substrate, which is a subunit of the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein involved in adenylate cyclase inhibition in a variety of other cell types, plays an essential role in the Ca2+-mobilizing receptor-mediated signal transduction system, conceivably in processes proximal to Ca2+ gating."
https://openalex.org/W2000181247,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type III (HTLV-III) is the probable etiologic agent for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). HTLV-III was isolated from semen and blood of a healthy homosexual man whose serum contains antibodies to HTLV-III. The finding of virus in semen supports epidemiologic data that suggest that AIDS can be transmitted sexually. In addition, the demonstration of HTLV-III in the blood and semen of a healthy individual establishes an asymptomatic, virus-positive carrier state which may be important in the dissemination of HTLV-III and, consequently, AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2028665648,"Epidemiological results suggest that the etiological agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is transmitted primarily through blood products, semen, and saliva. There is evidence that the human T-cell leukemia (lymphotropic) virus type III (HTLV-III) is this agent. HTLV-III has been isolated repeatedly from T cells obtained from peripheral blood or lymph node tissue of AIDS and pre-AIDS patients and of healthy people believed to have been exposed to the virus. In the present study, HTLV-III was detected in and isolated from T cells present in the seminal fluid of AIDS patients. Mononuclear cells from the semen of AIDS patients and normal individuals were cultured in the presence of T-cell growth factor (interleukin-2). After 6 to 8 days, HTLV-III antigens were transiently expressed by the cells from the AIDS patients but not by those from the normal individuals. When the mononuclear cells from the semen of AIDS patients were cocultured with a permissive human T-cell line, cell cultures were produced that expressed high levels of reverse transcriptase activity, showed retroviral particles by electron microscopy, and were positive for HTLV-III-specific antigens when tested by fixed-cell indirect immunofluorescence with the use of monoclonal antibodies to the p24 and p15 antigens of HTLV-III."
https://openalex.org/W2065977820,"5-Azacytidine converts the mouse embryonic cell line C3H 10T1/2 into differentiated chondrocytes, adipocytes, and skeletal muscle. Clonal and 2D protein gel analyses demonstrate that 5-azacytidine converts 10T1/2 cells into three stably determined, but undifferentiated, stem cell lineages which can differentiate into myofibers, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. Conversion of 10T1/2 cells is accompanied by specific changes in protein synthetic patterns unique for each cell lineage. We propose that 5-azacytidine converts 10T1/2 cells by hypomethylation of ""determination"" regulatory loci which establish lineages of stem cells with a restricted potential to differentiate into muscle, cartilage, or fat cells. Our results suggest that these three lineages are specified by separate regulatory loci and that as few as 1-3 hypomethylation events per cell are sufficient to activate the hypothesized muscle regulatory locus. Conversion of 10T1/2 cells by 5-azacytidine provides a model for studying regulatory genes involved in cell lineage determination."
https://openalex.org/W2023135619,"A transcript (RNA II) from the ColE1 primer promoter forms a persistent hybrid with the template DNA near the replication origin. The hybridized RNA II is cleaved by RNAase H to form the primer. Binding of RNA I to RNA II inhibits the hybridization and thus prevents primer formation. The binding is demonstrated by identification of the product. Analyses of the product with RNAase T1 revealed that pairing initiates at or near the 5′ end of RNA I and propagates toward its 3′ end. Removal of five nucleotides from the 5′ end of RNA I greatly reduces its binding activity. Prior to initiation of pairing, RNA I interacts with RNA II at their single-stranded loops. This interaction is transient but facilitates complete pairing along the entire length of RNA I that initiates from the 5′-end region."
https://openalex.org/W2007342471,"Natural and synthetic methylxanthines inhibit insect feeding and are pesticidal at concentrations known to occur in plants. These effects are due primarily to inhibition of phosphodiesterase activity and to an increase in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate. At lower concentrations, methylxanthines are potent synergists of other pesticides known to activate adenylate cyclase in insects. These data suggest that methylxanthines may function as natural insecticides and that phosphodiesterase inhibitors, alone or in combination with other compounds, may be useful in insect control."

https://openalex.org/W2036346288,"Monoclonal antibody Mab D1.1 recognizes on human melanoma cells a ganglioside antigen characterized by an alkali-labile O-acetylated sialic acid residue. Immunochemical analysis showed that this molecule is an O-acetylated product of the neuroectoderm-associated disialoganglioside GD3. Controlled chemical O-acetylation of purified GD3 resulted in the generation of this same epitope. Lysates of human melanoma cells were found to contain O-acetyltransferase activity capable of generating the antigenic epitope recognized by Mab D1.1. Thus, the addition of a single O-acetyl group to a common cell surface-associated ganglioside can create a potentially tumor-specific antigen."
https://openalex.org/W2042920193,"RNA I prevents a transcript (RNA II) from the ColE1 primer promoter to form a hybrid with the template DNA and thereby inhibits formation of primer for DNA replication. Binding of RNA I to RNA II is responsible for the inhibition. The Rom protein, a plasmid-specified 63 amino acid protein, enhances the inhibitory effect of RNA I on primer formation by enhancing the binding of RNA I to RNA II. In vivo, RNA I controls plasmid copy number and incompatibility and inhibits expression of a galK gene fused to the primer promoter. The rom gene modulates these activities of RNA I. These functions of the rom gene can be explained by alteration of the binding of RNA I to RNA II by the Rom protein."

https://openalex.org/W2079193268,"A macromolecular alteration occurs at the posttranscriptional level in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Compared with age-matched controls, total cellular RNA and polyadenylated RNA were substantially reduced in the AD cortex with many neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. RNA changes are associated with a significant increase in alkaline ribonuclease activity due to an abnormality in the ribonuclease-inhibitor complex. The decrease in protein synthesis in the AD brain, previously observed in patients severely affected with AD, and in translation systems in vitro with AD cortical messenger RNA, may be partly related to an enzyme-inhibitor alteration that affects RNA levels and activity. Decreased protein synthesis therefore may contribute to the characteristic decline in certain neurotransmitter enzymes and to the loss of neurons in the AD brain."
https://openalex.org/W2022476396,"Addition of gonadotropin releasing hormone to cultures of fetal rat pituitary induced differentiation of lactotropes as revealed by immunocytochemistry. Antiserum to luteinizing hormone (LH) (recognizing native LH), but not antiserum to LH-beta (recognizing both native LH and its beta subunit), inhibited this induction. Further addition of highly purified LH-alpha subunit in culture medium also induced lactotrope differentiation. Thus, the alpha subunit may have a specific biological activity of its own with probable practical use in clinical investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2079578031,"The small nuclear RNA, U1, is a highly conserved, 165 nucleotide long RNA which has been implicated in the processing of mRNA precursors. We present evidence that in the amphibian X. laevis there exist at least seven species of U1 RNA, which differ in sequence but not in length. Strikingly, these RNAs are not coordinately expressed. Two of the U1 RNAs are the predominant U1 species transcribed in the late blastula-early gastrula stages of Xenopus embryogenesis. These two RNAs, designated xU1a and xU1b, are not synthesized in significant amounts in stage 6 oocytes; a different set of U1 RNAs are expressed during late oogenesis. In a Xenopus cultured cell line, all of the U1 RNA species are expressed. Possible functions and developmental significance of these multiple U1 RNA species are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1980797512,"A cDNA clone, pXlgC20, was isolated from a library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA from stage 10 X. laevis gastrulae. This sequence hybridizes with up to nine different RNA species ranging in size from 1600 to 3500 nucleotides, regularly spaced at intervals of about 230 nucleotides. Clone pXlgC20 contains two complete repeats of a 228 bp sequence as well as part of a third repeat, all adjacent and in the same orientation. One possible translational reading frame in pXlgC20 completely spans the repeat sequences, coding for a protein composed of tandem 76 amino acid units. The amino acid sequence of each unit completely matches that of human ubiquitin. Ubiquitin is translated in the form of a multimeric precursor molecule containing several units. We show that genomic DNA fragments exist that contain at least 12 of these units in tandem and propose that the different mRNA size classes vary in their number of ubiquitin coding sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1988343568,"Antigenic variation in the haemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein of influenza virus is associated with recurrent epidemics of respiratory disease in man (for review see ref. 1). We have examined the size of structural changes necessary to alter the antigenicity of HA by determining the three-dimensional structure of the HA from an antigenic mutant containing a single amino acid substitution which was selected by growth of virus in the presence of monoclonal antibodies. Here we present evidence that the simple addition of an amino acid side chain which results in only minor local distortions of the structure of the HA is sufficient structural alteration for a virus to escape neutralization by a monoclonal antibody. Our results also demonstrate that single amino acid substitutions can cause only local changes in the HA structure, verifying the assumption made in several studies to locate antigenic sites on the HA and other molecules, and indicate that proposals of large conformational changes to account for variations in HA antigenicity are unnecessary in this case. The structure of the variant antigen has independently been successfully predicted (M. Karplus, personal communication)."
https://openalex.org/W1483556453,"A cDNA clone encoding part of chymotrypsin B was isolated from a cDNA library prepared from rat pancreatic mRNA and used as a probe to isolate the chymotrypsin B gene. The nucleotide sequence of this gene is presented. The 4709-base pair transcribed portion of the isolated gene was inferred from the cDNA and gene sequence, and the 5' border was determined by primer extension on pancreatic polyadenylated RNA. The coding portion of the gene is interrupted by six introns. The active site residues His 57, Asp 102, and Ser 195 are encoded by separate exons. Moreover, two regions of the enzyme which form the substrate-binding pocket are also encoded by separate exons. Thus, the substrate specificity and catalytic activity of the enzyme are produced by joining several exons encoding protein segments that are intrinsically catalytically inactive. The number and location of the intron/exon junctions of the chymotrypsin gene as compared to those of other serine protease genes, as well as the location of the genes on separate chromosomes, suggest that the duplication that resulted in the formation of the chymotrypsin gene was an ancient evolutionary event."
https://openalex.org/W1596238171,"Rapid Ca2+ release from Ca2+ -loaded sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles (SR) was previously shown to occur upon the addition of micromolar concentrations of heavy metals, and the extent of Ca2+ release was dependent on the binding affinity of the metal to sulfhydryl group(s) on an SR protein (Abramson, J.J., Weden, L., Trimm, J.L., and Salama, G. (1982) Biophys. J. 37, 134a; Abramson, J.J., Trimm, J.L., Weden, L., and Salama, G. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 80, 1526). The nature of this Ca2+ release site was examined further and found to be predominantly distributed in heavy SR (HSR) rather than light SR fractions. Ag+ -induced Ca2+ release from heavy SR was blocked by local anesthetics and ruthenium red which are known to inhibit Ca2+ release in skeletal fibers and in heavy SR, respectively. The rate of Ca2+ efflux from SR triggered by Ag+ was dependent on pH, Mg2+, and ionic strength of the medium. Efflux rates increased by a factor of 4 from pH 6.0 to 7.0 and then decreased in more alkaline reaction mixtures. Efflux rates from actively or passively loaded SR increased by a factor of 2.5 with increasing Mg2+ from 0 to 1 mM and then decreased in the range of 1 to 10 mM Mg2+. ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake by SR was similar in 100 mM KCl and in 200 mM sucrose solutions, but the extent and rate of Ca2+ efflux induced by Ag+ were dramatically reduced with decreasing ionic strength of the medium. In solutions containing 5 mM Mg2+, the rate of Ca2+ efflux from heavy SR averaged over the first 1.5 s after the addition of Ag+ was 58 nmol of Ca2+/mg of SR/s, a value comparable to the fast initial rate of ATP-dependent Ca2+ uptake. The maximum initial rate of Ag+ -induced Ca2+ efflux from heavy SR in 1 mM Mg2+ may be comparable to the rate of Ca2+ release and tension development in muscle fibers. Our data indicate that Ag+ reacts with a protein or proteins in the SR, probably not the (Ca2+, Mg2+)-ATPase, to induce a rapid release of Ca2+, possibly from the physiological Ca2+ release site."

https://openalex.org/W1577443529,"The amino acid sequences of two closely related peptides from Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) venom are reported. Helospectin I is a 38-residue peptide, His-Ser-Asp-Ala-Thr-Phe-Thr-Ala-Glu-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Leu-Leu-Ala-Lys-Leu-Ala- Leu-Gln - Lys-Tyr-Leu-Glu-Ser-Ile-Leu-Gly-Ser-Ser-Thr-Ser-Pro-Arg-Pro-Pro-Ser-Ser, and helospectin II is a 37-residue peptide identical to helospectin I except that it lacks serine 38. Helospectins are pancreatic secretagogues with structures and bioactivities similar to vasoactive intestinal peptide and other members of the glucagon superfamily. The relative significance of helospectin-I and helospectin-II is presently unknown. Comparison of the 28 residues of vasoactive intestinal peptide with residues 1-28 of helospectin shows that identical amino acids occur in 15 positions. Since members of the glucagon superfamily have similar structures but different biological actions, it is possible that helospectin is more closely related to a mammalian peptide awaiting discovery."
https://openalex.org/W1578062213,"Electron transfer to rat liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 of 14 alpha-methyl group demethylation of 24,25-dihydrolanosterol (C30-sterol) has been studied with a new radio-high-performance liquid chromatography assay. The monooxygenase is dependent upon NADPH plus oxygen, insensitive to CN-, and sensitive to CO. Microsomal oxidation is also sensitive to trypsin digestion, and reactivation is dependent upon the addition of purified, detergent-solubilized cytochrome P-450 reductase. Electron transport of C-32 sterol demethylation can be fully supported by very low concentrations of NADPH (approximately 10 microM) only in the presence of saturating concentrations of NADH (approximately 200 microM) suggesting involvement of cytochrome b5-dependent electron transfer in addition to the NADPH-supported pathway. The cytochrome P-450 of 14 alpha-demethylation has been solubilized with detergents, resolved chromatographically from cytochrome P-450 reductase and cytochrome b5, and fully active C-32 demethylase reconstituted. Incubation of intact microsomes with NADH and very low concentrations of NADPH described above leads to interruption of demethylation without 14 alpha-methyl group elimination. Under these conditions, C-32 oxidation products of the C30-sterol substrate accumulate at the expense of formation of demethylated, C29-sterol products. This enzymic interruption of C-32 demethylation, accumulation of oxygenated C30-sterols, along with subsequent demethylation of the isolated C30-oxysterols under similar oxidative conditions supports the suggestion that 14 alpha-hydroxymethyl and aldehydic sterols are metabolic intermediates of sterol 14 alpha-demethylation. Only very modest inductions of the constitutive cytochrome P-450 isozyme of 14 alpha-methyl sterol oxidase can be obtained with just 2 out of 12 known, potent inducers of mammalian hepatic cytochrome P-450s. Alternatively, administration of complete adjuvant in mineral oil drastically reduces amounts of total microsomal cytochrome P-450 while activity of 14 alpha-methyl sterol oxidase is not affected dramatically. Thus, as much as 2.5-fold enhancement of C-32 oxidase specific activity is obtained when expressed per unit of cytochrome P-450."
https://openalex.org/W2018466988,"The mutation I(1)npr-1 is located at cytological location 2B5 on the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster. We have found that this mutation causes absence of the normal product of the 2B5 locus and that it has the following phenotypes: the 68C glue puff on the third chromosome does not regress when mutant salivary glands are cultured in the presence of ecdysterone; the three 68C glue protein mRNAs are not synthesized; and a transformed Drosophila strain carrying both a normal resident 68C Sgs-3 gene and an introduced functional Sgs-3 gene with only a few kb of flanking sequences expresses neither Sgs-3 RNA if the I(1)npr-1 mutation is crossed into the stock. Thus the normal product of the I(1)npr11 gene is required for regression of the 68C puff, and the I(1)npr-1 gene product allows expression of the Sgs-3 gene by interacting, either directly or indirectly, with DNA sequences near this glue protein gene."
https://openalex.org/W1530581642,"Differential immunoaffinity chromatography using a combination of autoimmune antibodies allows for the rapid bulk separation of specific small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs). Passage of a HeLa cell extract over a column constructed of human anti-Sm autoantibodies results directly in the elution of complexes containing the small nuclear RNA species, U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6, and nine major polypeptides of molecular weight 69,000, 32,000, 27,000, 26,000, 18,500, 13,000, 11,000 doublet, and less than 10,000. Passage of crude extracts through a column bearing murine monoclonal antibodies directed against the 69,000 molecular weight (U1)RNP peptide gives an enriched population of U1 snRNP particles in the retained material. When the flowthrough material from the (U1)RNP column is passed through an anti-Sm column, the retained material is enriched in U2, U4, U5 plus U6 snRNP complex. The 69,000, 32,000, and 18,500 molecular weight polypeptides are confined to the U1 fraction while the remaining proteins are recovered in both fractions. The procedure is simple and rapid, producing complexes with a high degree of resolution and in sufficient yield to provide a ready source of snRNP complexes for functional studies."

https://openalex.org/W1790472336,"The sequence of one of the two major expressed human chorionic somatomammotropin genes (hCS-1) was determined. The hCS-1 gene and the human growth hormone gene (hGH-1) share 92% nucleotide sequence homology in their 5'- and 3'-flanking regions, introns and exons. This finding, in addition to the existence of multiple closely linked hGH and hCS genes, suggests that these genes are evolving by concerted mechanisms. S1 nuclease, hybridization, and primer extension analysis of placental poly(A+) RNA demonstrated the presence of two functional initiation sites within the hCS-1 and/or the hCS-2 gene(s). The majority (about 95%) of the transcripts initiate 30 nucleotides downstream from the TATAAA sequence, and about 5% of the transcripts initiate 30 nucleotides downstream from a CATAAA sequence located 55 nucleotides 5' to the TATAAA sequence. The presence of two functional promoter elements as well as direct repeated sequences flanking the TATAAA sequence and exon I of the hCS genes are consistent with the hypothesis (Cooke, N. E., and Baxter, J. D. (1982) Nature (Lond.) 297, 603-606) that an important regulatory element may have been inserted into the gene in a separate evolutionary event. An analysis of other direct repeats, internal homology, and homology between other growth hormone and chorionic somatomammotropin genes offers a more extensive conceptualization of how this gene family evolved."
https://openalex.org/W1556141382,"UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (transferase) clones were isolated from a cDNA bank constructed in pBR322 using transferase-enriched mRNA from the livers of phenobarbital-treated rats. The enrichment of mRNA was accomplished by polysome immunoadsorption with antibody to purified mouse liver transferase. This antibody was shown to bind specifically to rat transferase by Ouchterlony double diffusion analysis, immunoadsorption of glucuronidating activities, and selective inhibition of the immunoadsorption of in vitro synthesized enzyme by purified rat liver transferase. The isolated clones were verified to contain DNA complementary to transferase mRNA by hybrid translation-selection. Three classes of transferase cDNAs were characterized by restriction endonuclease mapping, and the largest insert-containing clone of each class was designated pUDPGTr-1, pUDPGTr-2, and pUDPGTr-3. Their insert sizes were approximately 2,400, 2,000, and 2,000 bp, respectively. All three cDNAs hybridized with a 2,300 +/- 150 bp mRNA, and each selected the translation of a 52,000-dalton polypeptide. Immunoadsorption of the 35S-labeled translation product could be competitively inhibited in each case by the addition of purified rat liver transferase. pUDPGTr-1 and pUDPGTr-3 inserts shared extensive sequence homology. This was demonstrated by Southern blot analysis using purified inserts and electron microscopic heteroduplex analysis. Southern blot analysis revealed that these cDNAs hybridized to overlapping genomic fragments. pUDPGTr-2 shared less sequence homology with the other two classes of cDNAs, based on the above criteria. In addition, mRNA corresponding to pUDPGTr-2 was elevated 5-fold by phenobarbital treatment, whereas the other mRNAs levels were unaffected. These studies demonstrate that in rat liver there are a minimum of three distinct transferase mRNAs, two of which may be associated with a common gene or gene family."

These HTLV-I-infected T-cell clones proliferated specifically in response to soluble tetanus toxoid but, unlike normal T cells, they could do so in the absence of accessory cells. The HTLV-I-infected T-cell clones did not present the antigen to autologous antigen-specific T cells that were not infected with HTLV-I. The capacity of helper-inducer T cells to retain antigen-specific reactivity after infection by HTLV-I, while losing the normal T-cell requirement for accessory cells, has clinical and theoretical implications."
https://openalex.org/W1555809376,"Evidence has been obtained for a specific protein receptor for prostacyclin on cells of the NCB-20 somatic hybrid. A new stable prostacyclin analog, 5-[(E)-(1S,5S,6R,7R) - 7 - hydroxy-6-[(E) - (3S,4RS) -3-hydroxy-4-methyl-1 -octen-6-inyl]bicyclo[3.3.0]-octan-3-ylidene]pentanoic acid (Iloprost, ZK36374) activates adenylate cyclase of NCB-20 cell membranes to an extent similar to prostacyclin and with a comparable high affinity. The binding of [3H]Iloprost to NCB-20 membranes was rapid with an association rate constant (k+1) of 2.01 X 10(5) M-1 s-1 at 20 degrees C. The rate constant for the dissociation of the ligand-receptor complex (k-1) was 1.19 X 10(-3) s-1, giving a dissociation constant (k-1/k+1) of 5.9 nM. The equilibrium dissociation constant was 29.9 nM, and the membranes had a maximum binding capacity of 347 fmol mg-1 protein. Radiation inactivation has been employed to determine the molecular weights of the functional prostacyclin receptor and components of the adenylate cyclase system in the plasma membrane of the NCB-20 cells. Cell membranes were lyophilized prior to irradiation, which lead to the formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates. The aggregation was avoided, however, when membranes were prepared in an isotonic Tris-HCl buffer containing sucrose. Molecular weight values of 111,000 for the catalytic subunit of adenylate cyclase, 89,000 for the regulatory subunit, and 83,000 for the prostacyclin receptor were obtained. Loss of [3H]Iloprost binding capacity after irradiation of lyophilized membranes yielded a molecular weight value (mean +/- S.E.) for the prostacyclin receptor of 82,800 +/- 12,900 (n = 3)."
https://openalex.org/W1606400231,"A partially purified HeLa cell DNA methylase will methylate a totally unmethylated DNA (de novo methylation) at about 3-4% the rate it will methylate a hemimethylated DNA template (maintenance methylation). Our evidence suggests that many, if not most, dCpdG sequences in a natural or synthetic DNA can be methylated by the enzyme. There is a powerful inhibitor of DNA methylase activity in crude extracts which has been identified as RNA. The inhibition of DNA methylase by RNA may indicate that this enzyme is regulated in vivo by the presence of RNA at specific chromosomal sites. The pattern of binding of RNA to DNA in the nucleosome structure and the DNA replication complex may determine specific sites of DNA methylation. An even more potent inhibition of DNA methylase activity is observed with poly(G), but not poly(C), poly(A), or poly(U). The only other synthetic polynucleotides studied which inhibit DNA methylation as well as poly(G) are the homopolymers poly(dC).poly(dG) and poly (dA).poly(dT). These results point out the unique importance of the guanine residue itself in the binding of the DNA methylase to dCpdG, the site of cytosine methylation. The surprising inhibition of the methylation reaction by poly(dA).poly(dT), which is itself not methylated by the enzyme, suggests the possible involvement of adjacent A and T residues in influencing the choice of sites of methylation by the enzyme."

Explantation of ganglia from 6-month-old rats to serum-supplemented culture resulted in a tenfold increase in SP concentration, reproducing results previously obtained for ganglia from neonatal rats. Veratridine prevented the increase in SP concentration in adult ganglia, and tetrodotoxin blocked the veratridine effect, suggesting that membrane depolarization and sodium influx prevented the rise in the SP content of adult ganglia as well as of neonatal ganglia. However, the time courses of the increase in the amount of the peptide differed in neonatal and mature ganglia, suggesting that some aspects of regulation may differ in the two. The effects of aging on neural plasticity were further analyzed by explanting ganglia from 2-year-old rats. No significant increase in SP concentration was observed in these ganglia. Remarkable plasticity thus seems to persist in mature neurons but may be deficient in aged sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1499576097,"Treatment of isolated rat liver nuclear envelopes with 1% Triton X-100 solubilized 20-30% of the nuclear envelope protein and 85% of the ATPase activity. Chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose in 1% Triton X-100 at pH 7.5 removed all of the chemically measurable phospholipid from the bound ATPase activity; however, endogenously synthesized phosphatidylinositol [4-32P]phosphate (PIP) co-chromatographed with the ATPase activity on this column. Further purification by chromatography on heparin-agarose removed all of the [32P]PIP and RNA from the ATPase; however, the recovery of ATPase activity from this column was very low. RNA, polyadenylic acid, and polyguanylic acid stimulated the delipidated ATPase activity 4-6-fold. This activity was not further stimulated by the addition of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, or phosphatidic acid, but was stimulated 2-fold by the addition of phosphatidylinositol. Addition of 40 microM PIP and 50 micrograms of RNA/ml resulted in a 25-fold stimulation of basal ATPase activity. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, in the presence of RNA, was also able to stimulate ATPase activity but to a lower extent than that of PIP. Therefore, the nuclear envelope-associated ATPase appears to require interaction with a polynucleotide and PIP to express full activity. PIP, which is actively metabolized in the nuclear envelope, may therefore be involved in the regulation of the activity of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1507523758,"A multiple mutant strain of Escherichia coli containing mutations affecting the exoribonucleases, RNase II, RNase D, and RNase BN, and also the endonuclease, RNase I, was constructed by P1-mediated transduction. Extracts of the mutant strain were lacking the aforementioned RNase activities. The multiple mutant displayed normal growth in both rich and minimal media at a variety of temperatures, recovered from starvation essentially as the wild-type parent, and could support the growth of a variety of bacteriophages. In addition, RNA synthesis was normal and no precursor RNA accumulation was observed. The properties of the mutant strain indicate that the three exoribonucleases are not essential for the viability of E. coli. The implications of these findings to our understanding of RNA processing and degradation are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2066961896,"Illumination of fly photoreceptors in the presence of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow initiates incorporation of the dye, which stains each cell down to its synaptic terminal. Unilluminated cells do not become stained. Experiments on animals in vivo show that selected cells can be stained without loss of viability. ""Induced endocytosis"" provides a plausible mechanism underlying this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2086221143,"Two regions of the gene for the human T-cell leukemia virus subgroup I (HTLV-I) envelope were expressed in Escherichia coli by use of the vector pJLA16. One corresponds to the carboxyl terminal region of the major envelope protein p46, and the other corresponds to the transmembrane protein p21E. Reactivity of the expressed protein with human serum was tested by the Western blot procedure. Each of 11 sera tested that had been shown to contain antibodies to HTLV-I or HTLV-II by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay recognized the bacterially synthesized envelope proteins. There was no reaction detected when 17 control sera were tested. This system will be useful for large-scale seroepidemiological surveys for HTLV-I and related human retroviruses."
https://openalex.org/W1543617518,"The assembly of the primosome, a multienzyme complex responsible for priming of lagging-strand DNA synthesis in Escherichia coli, occurs on defined regions of DNA. These primosome assembly sites are on the order of 70 nucleotides in length, yet they share little DNA sequence homology. In order to understand the interaction of the primosomal proteins with these sites, the isolation of single-base substitution mutants of the wild-type sequences has been undertaken. The response of 32 of these mutated primosome assembly sites to increasing concentrations of monovalent and divalent cations when they were used as DNA effectors for E. coli replication factor Y-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis and their efficiency as primosome-dependent DNA replication templates have revealed the existence of four distinct classes of mutations in primosome assembly sites. Class I mutations have essentially no effect on the activities elicited by the DNA site; thus, it is likely that they define nonessential or spacer nucleotide residues. Class II mutated DNAs require higher Mg2+ concentrations than the wild-type DNA to be fully activated as factor Y ATPase effectors and cannot be stimulated in the ATPase reaction by monovalent salt at suboptimal levels of Mg2+. The implication of this mutant phenotype on the role of secondary and tertiary DNA structure in determining an active site is examined in the accompanying article (Soeller, W., Abarzua, P., and Marians, K. J. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14293-14300). Class III mutations coinactivate both the ATPase effector and DNA replication template activity of the site, indicating that they probably represent essential contact points between factor Y and the DNA. Class IV mutated DNAs behave in a manner similar to class II mutated DNAs in the ATPase reaction, but have a replication template activity intermediate between that of the class III and class II mutant DNAs. It is possible that these mutant DNAs are deficient in their ability to catalyze, during primosome assembly, a step subsequent to that of factor Y binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1492123165,"Administration of streptozotocin produces a diabetic condition in mice characterized by a specific decrease in amylase synthesis in the pancreas as well as a substantial reduction in amylase mRNA concentration. We have studied this effect in mice of the congenic strains C3H.AmyYBR and C3H.AmyCE with multiple active copies of the pancreatic amylase structural gene. When mice of these strains are treated with streptozotocin, the magnitude of reduction in the synthesis of each amylase isozyme is different. These differences are reflected in the relative activities of isozyme-specific mRNAs in an in vitro translation assay. Administration of insulin results in partial restoration of normal phenotypes. The results provide genetic evidence that individual copies of the amylase structural gene are associated with divergent cis-acting insulin-responsive sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1532415667,"Abstract Transcriptional activity of the three human placental lactogen (hPL) genes was compared in vitro and their relation to the hPL RNA species obtained from term placenta was analyzed. We used in vitro transcription system containing the HeLa cell crude extract as the source for RNA polymerase II and initiation factors. Gene fragments of identical length of 0.96 kilobase pair made from hPL1, hPL3, and hPL4 each contained the 5' flanking sequence of 497 base pairs, the first exon, the first intron, and a portion of the second exon. More than 90% transcripts of the hPL1 template were 470 nucleotides long, indicating that transcription was initiated at the proposed cap site. hPL3 and hPL4 genes generated heterogeneous RNA products of about 430, 470, 520, and 680 nucleotides suggesting that multiple start points were recognized for RNA synthesis in vitro. alpha-Amanitin sensitivity of transcription indicated that the DNA-dependent RNA synthesis was carried out by RNA polymerase II. These results show that hPL1, hPL3, and hPL4 genes have functional promoters and multiple initiation sites for transcription. Primer extension analysis of the 5' termini of hPL RNA isolated from term placenta shows that 82-83% of the transcripts are initiated at a region 29 base pairs downstream from a TATA sequence. This origin is observed in vitro for the transcript 470 nucleotides long. An additional upstream initiation region (-53) accounts for 8% of transcripts in term placenta and corresponds to the origin for the in vitro transcript of 520 nucleotides. At least three other sites 15, 23, and 39 base pairs downstream from the major cap site are functional in vivo. The initiation site at +40 is utilized preferentially for transcription from hPL3 and hPL4 genes in vitro. We have mapped the different transcription origins on hPL genes."
https://openalex.org/W1599095642,"A monoclonal antibody JO1 X 1 was prepared against human abnormal prothrombin using the hybridoma technique. The clone secreting this antibody was selected on the basis of the ability of this antibody to bind to abnormal prothrombin, but not to prothrombin, in the presence of calcium ions. The antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography in EDTA on columns of prothrombin-Sepharose. Bound antibodies were eluted with 15 mM CaCl2. The kinetics of dissociation of antibody from the antibody-prothrombin complex with the addition of calcium ions fit a first-order kinetic model. Increasing CaCl2 concentration increased the rate of antibody-prothrombin dissociation. Ca(II) and Mn(II) inhibited antibody-prothrombin interaction; half-maximal binding was observed at 0.9 and 4 mM, respectively. Mg(II) had little effect on antibody-antigen interaction. The JO1 X 1 antibody bound fragment 1, fragment (1-39), abnormal prothrombin, and prothrombin equivalently in the presence of EDTA, but did not bind to des(1-44)prothrombin in the presence of EDTA or prothrombin in the presence of CaCl2. These results indicate that the monoclonal antibody JO1 X 1 is conformation specific for the calcium-free conformer of prothrombin and directed against an antigenic determinant near the NH2 terminus of prothrombin expressed in the 1-39 region of the protein. This analysis provides confirmation of the presence of a metal-free conformer of prothrombin."
https://openalex.org/W1501214174,"Guinea pig seminal vesicle epithelium is an androgen-dependent tissue composed of tall columnar cells which synthesize four major secretory proteins designated SVP-1-4. Castration promptly causes the seminal vesicle epithelium cells to undergo major morphological changes. By the fifth day after castration, cell number decreases to 12% of normal, and the surviving cells are greatly involuted structurally. An injection of testosterone was sufficient to stimulate individual cell growth to the normal tall columnar configuration by 48 h without increasing cell number. Cell growth following testosterone was preceded by a 4-fold increase between 0-12 h in total cellular RNA signifying a large increase in rRNAs. To aid in the analysis of gene expression during androgen repletion, we identified a cDNA plasmid clone representing the 3'-end of the mRNA of SVP-4. The clone pAT 76 was identified by hybrid-select translation and characterization of the product of in vitro translation. The steady-state levels of SVP-4 mRNA in blots of total cellular RNA increased between 0-24 h; this appeared to be due mainly to a general nonselective increase in all or most of the abundant mRNAs. We demonstrated by in vitro translation studies that the corresponding transcript was still present during the 5th and 36th days of castration without having undergone a selective loss in abundance and during hormone repletion without undergoing a selective increase. Testosterone exerted an early and more conspicuous effect on rRNA synthesis. Whether direct or indirect this may be a key event underlying the ultimate action of testosterone, namely maintenance of cell structure."
https://openalex.org/W1582077960,The interferon receptor was solubilized from human lymphoblastoid (Namalva) cell membranes with Triton X-100. It was purified by chromatography on wheat-germ lectin-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite and by affinity chromatography on interferon-hexanoyl-Sepharose. The partially purified receptor was analyzed by gel filtration on Sepharose 6B and by sucrose gradient sedimentation in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. Gel filtration analysis yielded a Stokes radius of 74 A for the receptor-Triton X-100 complex. Sedimentation in sucrose gradients revealed an heterogeneous pattern of distribution with a plateau of activity between 4 and 10 S. Removal of suspected lipid material and Triton X-100 by extraction with isoamyl alcohol resulted in an accelerated rate of receptor sedimentation in a sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing sucrose gradient. Under these conditions it manifested an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 13.6 S. The dissociation constants Kd derived from Scatchard analysis of binding data with the purified receptor were in the range of 0.2-0.5 nM.
https://openalex.org/W1546470286,"The p30 antigen from Rauscher leukemia virus (R-MuLV) was separated into two fractions by chromatography on either phosphocellulose or DEAE-cellulose. The p30-I and p30-II were indistinguishable immunologically or by isoelectrofocusing and gel electrophoresis. An ATPase activity was tightly associated with p30-II that could not be separated by ion-exchange chromatography, isoelectrofocusing, or glycerol velocity gradient sedimentation. The ATPase hydrolyzed the gamma phosphate from only ATP or dATP. Immunoglobulin directed against R-MuLV p30 completely inhibited the p30-II associated ATPase. Glycerol velocity gradient analysis showed that p30-I sedimented as a 30-kDa species while the p30-II and its associated ATPase sedimented as a 60-kDa species. The p30-II was converted entirely to a 30-kDa form by treatment with 0.2% (w/v) lithium dodecyl sulfate, suggesting that it represented a complexed species of p30. Finally, p30-II was found to stimulate the activity of R-MuLV reverse transcriptase, but p30-I had no effect on the activity of the enzyme. These results suggested the existence of at least two different forms of p30 in R-MuLV."
