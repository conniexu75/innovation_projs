https://openalex.org/W3109457440,"The expanding pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires the development of safe, efficacious and fast-acting vaccines. Several vaccine platforms are being leveraged for a rapid emergency response1. Here we describe the development of a candidate vaccine (YF-S0) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses live-attenuated yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine as a vector to express a noncleavable prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike antigen. We assess vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in several animal models. YF-S0 has an excellent safety profile and induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), mice (Mus musculus) and cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis), and—concomitantly—protective immunity against yellow fever virus. Humoral immunity is complemented by a cellular immune response with favourable T helper 1 polarization, as profiled in mice. In a hamster model2 and in macaques, YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, a single dose conferred protection from lung disease in most of the vaccinated hamsters within as little as 10 days. Taken together, the quality of the immune responses triggered and the rapid kinetics by which protective immunity can be attained after a single dose warrant further development of this potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate. A candidate vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 that uses the yellow fever 17D live-virus vector is highly efficacious and displays a favourable safety profile in Syrian hamster, mouse and cynomolgus macaque models."

We identified tumor-specific frameshifts encoding multiple epitopes that originated from indel mutations shared among patients with MSI-H endometrial, colorectal, and stomach cancers. Epitopes derived from these shared frameshifts have high population occurrence rates, wide presence in many tumor subclones, and are predicted to bind to the most frequent MHC alleles in MSI-H patient cohorts. Neoantigens arising from these mutations are distinctly unlike self and viral antigens, signifying novel groups of potentially highly immunogenic tumor antigens. We further confirmed the immunogenicity of frameshift peptides in T cell stimulation experiments using blood mononuclear cells isolated from both healthy donors and MSI-H cancer patients. Our study uncovers the widespread occurrence and strong immunogenicity of tumor-specific antigens derived from shared frameshift mutations in MSI-H cancer and Lynch syndrome patients, suitable for the design of common ""off-the-shelf"" cancer vaccines."

Here we show that 50% of G34R/V tumors (n = 95) bear activating PDGFRA mutations that display strong selection pressure at recurrence. Although considered gliomas, G34R/V tumors actually arise in GSX2/DLX-expressing interneuron progenitors, where G34R/V mutations impair neuronal differentiation. The lineage of origin may facilitate PDGFRA co-option through a chromatin loop connecting PDGFRA to GSX2 regulatory elements, promoting PDGFRA overexpression and mutation. At the single-cell level, G34R/V tumors harbor dual neuronal/astroglial identity and lack oligodendroglial programs, actively repressed by GSX2/DLX-mediated cell fate specification. G34R/V may become dispensable for tumor maintenance, whereas mutant-PDGFRA is potently oncogenic. Collectively, our results open novel research avenues in deadly tumors. G34R/V gliomas are neuronal malignancies where interneuron progenitors are stalled in differentiation by G34R/V mutations and malignant gliogenesis is promoted by co-option of a potentially targetable pathway, PDGFRA signaling."

This paper shows how integrating behavioral data and mutual prediction models into hyperscanning studies can lead to advances in embodied social neuroscience. Hyperscanning—the recording of brain activity from multiple individuals—can be hard to interpret. This paper shows how integrating behavioral data and mutual prediction models into hyperscanning studies can lead to advances in embodied social neuroscience. Social interaction is central to our cognition and our health. Our actions and decision-making in everyday life are heavily influenced by others, and atypical social interactions are a feature of the majority of psychiatric and mental health conditions. Understanding the brain mechanisms of social interaction is therefore an important goal for human neuroscience. Hyperscanning, the measurement of brain activity from more than one individual at the same time (Figure 1A), has recently been hailed as a game-changer in the study of human social interaction (Gvirts and Perlmutter, 2019Gvirts H.Z. Perlmutter R. What Guides Us to Neurally and Behaviorally Align With Anyone Specific? A Neurobiological Model Based on fNIRS Hyperscanning Studies.Neuroscientist. 2019; 26: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This paper takes a critical look at some of the claims that have been made for hyperscanning and the limitations of many analyses. We further suggest that, by integrating data from brain and behavior, it will be possible to move beyond the hype and realize the potential of this new domain. We focus primarily on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS; Pinti et al., 2020aPinti P. Tachtsidis I. Hamilton A. Hirsch J. Aichelburg C. Gilbert S. Burgess P.W. The present and future use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for cognitive neuroscience.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2020; 1464: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) because fNIRS is one of the most widely used hyperscanning modalities, but we also consider EEG and electrophysiology. A good example of the hyperscanning genre is an influential paper from Cui and colleagues (Cui et al., 2012Cui X. Bryant D.M. Reiss A.L. NIRS-based hyperscanning reveals increased interpersonal coherence in superior frontal cortex during cooperation.Neuroimage. 2012; 59: 2430-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). This study captured data from the prefrontal cortex of pairs of participants performing two distinct tasks: a cooperation task where both participants must try to press a button at the same time, and a competition task where the two participants must try to press the button as fast as possible. The participants cannot communicate directly but receive feedback after each trial, which enables them to improve their performance. fNIRS signals from prefrontal cortex were analyzed with wavelet coherence (Figure 1B), which showed greater coherence in right superior frontal cortex during the cooperation blocks compared to competition or solo performance. A number of studies have replicated and extended the finding of coherence in prefrontal cortex when participants are engaged in a social interaction, including situations of conversation, eye contact, decision-making, and motor coordination tasks (Fishburn et al., 2018Fishburn F.A. Murty V.P. Hlutkowsky C.O. MacGillivray C.E. Bemis L.M. Murphy M.E. Huppert T.J. Perlman S.B. Putting our heads together: interpersonal neural synchronization as a biological mechanism for shared intentionality.Soc. Cogn. Affect. Neurosci. 2018; 13: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, differences in the strength of cross-brain coherence have been seen in ingroup compared to outgroup pairs (Yang et al., 2020Yang J. Zhang H. Ni J. De Dreu C.K.W. Ma Y. Within-group synchronization in the prefrontal cortex associates with intergroup conflict.Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), in mixed gender pairs compared to within gender pairs, and in relation to autistic traits in children (reviewed in Pinti et al., 2020aPinti P. Tachtsidis I. Hamilton A. Hirsch J. Aichelburg C. Gilbert S. Burgess P.W. The present and future use of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for cognitive neuroscience.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2020; 1464: 5-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Based on these results, some strong claims have been made for the importance of hyperscanning in cognitive neuroscience and psychiatry. For example, brain-to-brain coupling has been described as a “mechanism for transmitting information… regarding remote events” (Hasson et al., 2012Hasson U. Ghazanfar A.A. Galantucci B. Garrod S. Keysers C. Brain-to-brain coupling: a mechanism for creating and sharing a social world.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 114-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) or as a “mechanism of shared intentionality” (Fishburn et al., 2018Fishburn F.A. Murty V.P. Hlutkowsky C.O. MacGillivray C.E. Bemis L.M. Murphy M.E. Huppert T.J. Perlman S.B. Putting our heads together: interpersonal neural synchronization as a biological mechanism for shared intentionality.Soc. Cogn. Affect. Neurosci. 2018; 13: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One paper suggests that brain-to-brain coupling “might trigger the neural mechanism guiding social alignment” (Gvirts and Perlmutter, 2019Gvirts H.Z. Perlmutter R. What Guides Us to Neurally and Behaviorally Align With Anyone Specific? A Neurobiological Model Based on fNIRS Hyperscanning Studies.Neuroscientist. 2019; 26: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that hyperscanning measures might allow us to diagnose developmental and psychiatric disorders (Leong and Schilbach, 2019Leong V. Schilbach L. The promise of two-person neuroscience for developmental psychiatry: using interaction-based sociometrics to identify disorders of social interaction.Br. J. Psychiatry. 2019; 215: 1-3Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and that using brain stimulation to impose coupling on participants might even treat such disorders (Gvirts and Perlmutter, 2019Gvirts H.Z. Perlmutter R. What Guides Us to Neurally and Behaviorally Align With Anyone Specific? A Neurobiological Model Based on fNIRS Hyperscanning Studies.Neuroscientist. 2019; 26: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These are ambitious claims for an emerging technology and deserve careful and detailed examination. Hyperscanning studies clearly show that there are robust patterns of coherence across brains, but the best way to interpret this data is less clear. Claims that there is a mechanism extending across more than one brain can feel like telepathy, disconnected from our standard models of cognition or from a plausible biological framework. To obtain a better understanding of what cross-brain coherence actually means and the challenges faced by this new domain, it helps to first understand some basic limitations of coherence measures. First, these measures describe the relationship between two time series of data, but do not take into account any other factors: changes in participant behavior or the task or testing environment do not feature in most coherence analyses. Second, coherence measures show only symmetrical effects, where both brains show the same pattern of change. Many social interactions (e.g., giving/taking an object, turn-taking in conversation) are asymmetric, with two participants having different roles, but it is not clear if coherence analysis can capture this. Third, the relationship between hyperscanning results and traditional models of cognition is not clear—because the analysis is specific to the two-person situation, hyperscanning studies sometimes do not examine or interpret the one-person contrasts that a traditional cognitive neuroscientist might expect to see. An even more important challenge for the interpretation of hyperscanning data is the relationship between cross-brain coherence in hyperscanning (Figure 1A) and inter-subject correlations recorded in sequential studies (Figure 1C). We know that two people each viewing the same movie alone in an MRI scanner show similar brain activity patterns and that this effect is even seen if one person tells a story and the other listens (Hasson et al., 2012Hasson U. Ghazanfar A.A. Galantucci B. Garrod S. Keysers C. Brain-to-brain coupling: a mechanism for creating and sharing a social world.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 114-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). These results reflect the fact that common cognitive processing of an external stimulus can give rise to coherence between brains. As recently pointed out for EEG data (Burgess, 2013Burgess A.P. On the interpretation of synchronization in EEG hyperscanning studies: a cautionary note.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2013; 7: 881Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), coherence in fNIRS could arise because both participants respond in the same way to common environmental stimuli. Thus, it could be argued that the robust coherence patterns reported in many hyperscanning studies reveal the similar processing of the shared environment and common task set experienced by the two participants and not any additional social factors. There are two feasible responses to the challenge of common processing. One is to design more complex methods that factor out the common effects. Several studies do this by increasing the number of participants tested. For example, if a study records data from three (or more) people who are in the same room at the same time, and two of those participants show strong coherence while the others do not, it is hard to argue that the matched sensory environment is driving the coherence (Fishburn et al., 2018Fishburn F.A. Murty V.P. Hlutkowsky C.O. MacGillivray C.E. Bemis L.M. Murphy M.E. Huppert T.J. Perlman S.B. Putting our heads together: interpersonal neural synchronization as a biological mechanism for shared intentionality.Soc. Cogn. Affect. Neurosci. 2018; 13: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar; Yang et al., 2020Yang J. Zhang H. Ni J. De Dreu C.K.W. Ma Y. Within-group synchronization in the prefrontal cortex associates with intergroup conflict.Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, it remains possible that common motor processing or common cognitive processing between the interacting participants drives these effects. A second option is to accept the argument that fNIRS hyperscanning can only measure common processing between two brains and use this as relevant outcome. Studies of individual differences in coherence levels or studies of coherence across social groups typically take the overall coherence level as an index of how well people are coordinating. Recent data shows that this can correlate with performance on a social decision-making task (Yang et al., 2020Yang J. Zhang H. Ni J. De Dreu C.K.W. Ma Y. Within-group synchronization in the prefrontal cortex associates with intergroup conflict.Nat. Neurosci. 2020; 23: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Such studies typically require very large sample sizes in order to relate dyad-level differences in coherence to dyad-level differences in behavior. However, it may be hard or impossible to pin down any effects to one person in the pair. This limits the usefulness of coherence analyses for the tracking or diagnosis of clinical populations, where results must be robust at a single subject level and it must be possible to define which individual within a pair or group is showing atypical brain activity. Finally, if coherence measures in a hyperscanning context really are measuring exactly the same thing as intersubject correlations used in an fMRI context, then asking participants to watch a movie alone might give more robust and repeatable results for clinical use. The pioneering studies of human hyperscanning have made an important contribution in showing what can be done in a new domain. However, the limitations described above mean that the claim that hyperscanning will revolutionize social neuroscience might seem like just hype. If coherence measures are unable to consider behavior or relate to traditional models and cannot distinguish interaction from common processing, then the value of hyperscanning might seem limited. To move beyond the hype, we may need to do bigger, better experiments and interpret them within a stronger theoretical framework. An important starting point is the recognition that interacting brains exist within interacting bodies. Visual, auditory, and motor processes mediate any coordination between two brains, so we must study brains and bodily coordination together. This means that labs must capture and analyze behavioral data from their participants, considering how each individual in a social interaction uses their actions to signal to others and receives social information from others. There are now an increasing number of flexible technologies available to capture participants’ hand and body movements, eye movements, facial expressions, and physiological changes, and such systems should be standard in a hyperscanning lab (Figure 1D). These tools also mean that it is possible, even desirable, to move away from traditional experimental designs where discrete trials are repeated many times. Such methods give tight control to an experimenter but do not create a natural and meaningful social interaction where participants can engage in a variety of social behaviors. Moving toward more natural task scenarios, where people can work together over a longer period of time, observing each other and responding to each other, might reveal different patterns of social behavior or social brain activity that are suppressed in the controlled lab situation. By capturing and analyzing data from both brain and body while participants are engaged in natural interactions, it will be possible to understand how the coordination of social brains is embodied in the interaction of social bodies. We also need a neurocognitive theory within which to understand this kind of interaction. A strong candidate emerges if we focus on what participants are actually doing during a social interaction. They must control their own motor behavior, moving hands, face, and gaze to interact with their partner, and they must also understand and predict their partner’s motor behavior in order to act appropriately. Both acting and predicting are very general requirements—whether people are cooking a meal together, playing a piano duet, or taking turns in conversation, the requirement to predict one’s partner and perform one’s own action is essential to a fluent social interaction. This idea has recently been formalized in the mutual prediction theory (Kingsbury et al., 2019Kingsbury L. Huang S. Wang J. Gu K. Golshani P. Wu Y.E. Hong W. Correlated Neural Activity and Encoding of Behavior across Brains of Socially Interacting Animals.Cell. 2019; 178: 429-446.e16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The central claim here is that each individual in a social interaction has brain systems that control their own behavior (A-self and B-self in Figure 1E) as well as brain systems that predict the behavior of their partner (A-Other and B-Other in Figure 1E). If these systems are co-localized in the brain and all the neural activity of both systems is summed for a crude measure, then there will be a pattern of similarity or coherence between the overall brain activity of individual A and individual B. Thus, when prediction mechanisms that operate within the brain of a single individual are engaged in two people who mutually predict each other, this can give rise to signals that are coherent across the two brains. Evidence in support of mutual prediction theory was found in a detailed study of pairs of interacting mice. Kingsbury and colleagues used microendoscopic calcium imaging to record from hundreds of neurons in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) of pairs of mice while their behavior was tracked in natural social interactions. They identified neurons that encoded the mouse’s own actions and other neurons that encoded the actions of the partner mouse, consistent with the mutual prediction model. More importantly, the summed activity across the PFC showed coherence across the two animals, demonstrating that mutual prediction at a fine-grained level can give rise to patterns of cross-brain coherence at a whole-brain level. Furthermore, they could quantify the asymmetry in the social relationship between the mice, with subordinate mice showing more prediction of their partner than dominant mice. Data were analyzed by adding behavioral data and cross-brain data to a traditional general linear model (GLM) in order to model the activity of one individual’s brain in terms of both their behavior and their partner’s behavior and brain activity (cross-brain GLM or xGLM; Figure 1F). The outputs of this analyses allow the researcher to quantify the contribution of each different factor within the model (self-behavior, other-behavior, task, and cross-brain contributions) and can be interpreted in relation to traditional cognitive neuroscience. Thus, the xGLM analysis allows researchers to integrate data across different modalities in freely moving animals engaged in a social interaction and test the mutual prediction hypothesis in a tractable fashion. To test if mutual prediction also applies in humans, it will be useful to use xGLM approaches in modeling data from human hyperscanning studies. Initial hints that this can work are seen in a recent study (Pinti et al., 2020bPinti P. Devoto A. Greenhalgh I. Tachtsidis I. Burgess P. Hamilton A. The role of anterior prefrontal cortex (area 10) in face-to-face deception measured with fNIRS.Soc. Cogn. Affect. Neurosci. 2020; 2020: 1-14Google Scholar) in which pairs of participants play a card game similar to poker—one participant has the role of informer and can choose to lie or tell the truth about her card, while her partner must guess if the card is high or low and will win points for a correct answer. Activity across prefrontal cortex in the informer was linked to deceptive intent. More critically, an xGLM analysis with a range of time lags identified two channels in the informer’s brain where activity patterns reliably preceded similar activity in the guesser’s brain with a 2 s time lag. This provides a clue to mutual prediction in humans, but unfortunately this study used a task where it is very challenging for participants to accurately predict each other (thus making it hard to see mutual prediction signals) and did not record behavioral or physiological factors in sufficient detail to implement a full xGLM approach. Future studies that directly contrast cooperative and competitive tasks with and without the ability to predict and with more detailed recordings of social behavior will be very valuable. These two studies provide initial evidence that the mutual prediction theory can account for patterns of cross-brain coherence in both mice and humans engaged in a social interaction. The theory can also help us understand older datasets like the original hyperscanning study from Cui et al., 2012Cui X. Bryant D.M. Reiss A.L. NIRS-based hyperscanning reveals increased interpersonal coherence in superior frontal cortex during cooperation.Neuroimage. 2012; 59: 2430-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar described above. That study compared a “cooperation” task to a “competition” task and has sometimes been interpreted in terms of cross-brain mechanisms of cooperation. However, close examination of the cognitive demands of the tasks shows that the cooperation task requires a high degree of mutual prediction—participants must predict each other’s movements in order to act at the same time. In contrast, the competition task requires participants to move as fast as possible, and predicting the partner would only be a distraction. Thus, the differences in cross-brain coherence patterns between these two tasks are entirely consistent with the mutual prediction hypothesis. It is possible to make the further prediction that cross-brain coherence would not be seen if participants engaged in a cooperation task that does not demand mutual prediction, such as winning points if both people move faster than an external limit. Overall, studies of mutual prediction demonstrate that examining brain and behavior together helps us understand how bodily actions mediate and implement social interactions. Within this idea, the mutual prediction hypothesis provides a strong framework to interpret hyperscanning studies of human and animal social interactions and has several advantages. First, it proposes a specific predictive mechanism that causes cross-brain coherence based on detailed animal data and in line with more general predictive models of cognition. Second, it motivates and enables the integration of brain and behavior into a unified model in which the social brain is working to predict and enact social behavior. Third, the xGLM approach to data analysis builds on a long tradition of research in cognitive neuroscience, allowing us to extend existing models to include behavioral and cross-brain data and model both symmetric and asymmetric interactions. This means it will be feasible to analyze data from a wider range of contexts and integrate new hyperscanning results with our fundamental theories of cognitive neuroscience. Finally, the examples above demonstrate how the study of interacting brains and bodies together can be applied across both controlled lab settings and unstructured ecologically valid interactions, allowing us to move social neuroscience research into the real world. This short review has described the challenges of interpreting cross-brain coherence data and suggests two new ways to overcome these challenges. In terms of designing research, if we can collect and integrate data from interacting bodies (hands, faces, eyes, speech) as well as interacting brains, then we have the potential to understand how embodied interactions cause cross-brain coherence effects. The analysis of data with xGLMs provides one way to accomplish this integration, but other methods such as Granger causality might also be valuable. In terms of neural mechanisms, the mutual prediction hypothesis gives us a clear framework within which to interpret data from different cognitive tasks, as well as make specific predictions for future research studies. By combining these advances with new methods for tracking and interpreting natural social behavior, it will be possible for hyperscanning to go beyond the recent hype and to reveal neurocognitive mechanisms that support our human face-to-face social interactions."

By studying metastasis in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BM-MSC)-driven lung cancer models, microarray time-series data analysis by systems biology approaches revealed BM-MSC-induced signaling triggers early dissemination of CD133+/CD83+ cancer stem cells (CSCs) from primary sites shortly after STAT3 activation but promotes proliferation towards secondary sites. The switch from migration to proliferation was regulated by BM-MSC-secreted LIF and activated LIFR/p-ERK/pS727-STAT3 signaling to promote early disseminated cancer cells MET and premetastatic niche formation. Then, tumor-tropic BM-MSCs circulated to primary sites and triggered CD151+/CD38+ cells acquiring EMT-associated CSC properties through IL6R/pY705-STAT3 signaling to promote tumor initiation and were also attracted by and migrated towards the premetastatic niche. In summary, STAT3 phosphorylation at tyrosine 705 and serine 727 differentially regulates the EMT-MET switch within the distinct molecular subtypes of CSCs to complete the metastatic process."

We directly exposed air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from primary human nonsmoker airway basal stem cells (ABSCs) to short term CS and then infected them with SARS-CoV-2. We found an increase in the number of infected airway cells after CS exposure with a lack of ABSC proliferation. Single-cell profiling of the cultures showed that the normal interferon response was reduced after CS exposure with infection. Treatment of CS-exposed ALI cultures with interferon β-1 abrogated the viral infection, suggesting one potential mechanism for more severe viral infection. Our data show that acute CS exposure allows for more severe airway epithelial disease from SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the innate immune response and ABSC proliferation and has implications for disease spread and severity in people exposed to CS."

Previous oceanographic modelling and current drifter data have been used to predict the movement and accumulation of plastic pollution in the marine environment, but our understanding of the transport and fate through riparian systems is still largely unknown. Here we undertook a proof of concept study by applying open source tracking technology (both GPS (Global Positing System) cellular networks and satellite technology), which have been successfully used in many animal movement studies, to track the movements of individual plastic litter items (500 ml PET (polyethylene terephthalate) drinks bottles) through the Ganges River system (known as the Ganga in India and the Padma and Meghna in Bangladesh, hereafter known as the Ganges) and the Bay of Bengal. Deployed tags were successfully tracked through the Ganges river system and into the Bay of Bengal marine system. The ""bottle tags"" were designed and built (e.g. shape, size, buoyancy) to replicate true movement patterns of a plastic bottle. The maximum distance tracked to date is 2845 km over a period of 94 days. We discuss lessons learnt from the development of these plastic litter tags, and outline how the potential widespread use of this open source technology has the ability to significantly increase understanding of the location of accumulation areas and the timing of large inputs of plastic pollution into the aquatic system. Furthermore, ""bottle tags"" may act as a powerful tool for stimulating social behaviour change, informing science-based policy, and as valuable educational outreach tools for public awareness."

https://openalex.org/W3109584389,"Uveal melanoma (UM) is a currently untreatable form of melanoma with a 50% mortality rate. Characterization of the essential signaling pathways driving this cancer is critical to develop target therapies. Activating mutations in the Gαq signaling pathway at the level of GNAQ, GNA11, or rarely CYSLTR2 or PLCβ4 are considered alterations driving proliferation in UM and several other neoplastic disorders. Here, we systematically examined the oncogenic signaling output of various mutations recurrently identified in human tumors. We demonstrate that CYSLTR2 → GNAQ/11 → PLCβ act in a linear signaling cascade that, via protein kinase C (PKC), activates in parallel the MAP-kinase and FAK/Yes-associated protein pathways. Using genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition, we show that the PKC/RasGRP3/MAPK signaling branch is the essential component that drives the proliferation of UM. Only inhibition of the MAPK branch but not the FAK branch synergizes with inhibition of the proximal cascade, providing a blueprint for combination therapy. All oncogenic signaling could be extinguished by the novel GNAQ/11 inhibitor YM-254890, in all UM cells with driver mutation in the Gαq subunit or the upstream receptor. Our findings highlight the GNAQ/11 → PLCβ → PKC → MAPK pathway as the central signaling axis to be suppressed pharmacologically to treat for neoplastic disorders with Gαq pathway mutations."
https://openalex.org/W3110416952,"Metastasis remains the major obstacle to improved survival for breast cancer patients. Downregulation of FOXO3a transcription factor in breast cancer is causally associated with the development of metastasis through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we report that FOXO3a is functionally related to the inhibition of VEGF-A/NRP1 signaling and to the consequent suppression of breast cancer metastasis. We show that FOXO3a directly induces miR-29b-2 and miR-338 expression. Ectopic expression of miR-29b-2/miR-338 significantly suppresses EMT, migration/invasion, and in vivo metastasis of breast cancer. Moreover, we demonstrate that miR-29b-2 directly targets VEGF-A while miR-338 directly targets NRP1, and show that regulation of miR-29b-2 and miR-338 mediates the ability of FOXO3a to suppress VEGF-A/NRP1 signaling and breast cancer metastasis. Clinically, our results show that the FOXO3a-miR-29b-2/miR-338-VEGF-A/NRP1 axis is dysregulated and plays a critical role in disease progression in breast cancer. Collectively, our findings propose that FOXO3a functions as a metastasis suppressor, and define a novel signaling axis of FOXO3a-miRNA-VEGF-A/NRP1 in breast cancer, which might be potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer."

There are no effective pharmacologic therapies for ARDS. Colchicine is a low-cost, widely available drug, effective in the treatment of inflammatory conditions. We studied the effects of colchicine pre-treatment on oleic acid-induced ARDS in rats. Rats were treated with colchicine (1 mg/kg) or placebo for three days prior to intravenous oleic acid-induced ALI (150 mg/kg). Four hours later they were studied and compared to a sham group. Colchicine reduced the area of histological lung injury by 61%, reduced lung edema, and markedly improved oxygenation by increasing PaO 2 /FiO 2 from 66 ± 13 mmHg (mean ± SEM) to 246 ± 45 mmHg compared to 380 ± 18 mmHg in sham animals. Colchicine also reduced PaCO 2 and respiratory acidosis. Lung neutrophil recruitment, assessed by myeloperoxidase immunostaining, was greatly increased after injury from 1.16 ± 0.19% to 8.86 ± 0.66% and significantly reduced by colchicine to 5.95 ± 1.13%. Increased lung NETosis was also reduced by therapy. Circulating leukocytosis after ALI was not reduced by colchicine therapy, but neutrophils reactivity and CD4 and CD8 cell surface expression on lymphocyte populations were restored. Colchicine reduces ALI and respiratory failure in experimental ARDS in relation with reduced lung neutrophil recruitment and reduced circulating leukocyte activation. This study supports the clinical development of colchicine for the prevention of ARDS in conditions causing ALI."
https://openalex.org/W3106887972,"Early-onset sporadic rectal cancer (EOSRC) is a unique and predominant colorectal cancer (CRC) subtype in India. In order to understand the tumorigenic process in EOSRC, we performed whole-exome sequencing of 47 microsatellite stable EOSRC samples. Signature 1 was the predominant mutational signature in EOSRC, as previously shown in other CRC exome studies. More importantly, we identified TP53, KRAS, APC, PIK3R1, SMAD4 and ZNF880 as significantly mutated (q < 0.1) and ARID1A and ARID2 as near-significantly mutated (restricted hypothesis testing; q < 0.1) candidate drivers. Unlike the other candidates, the tumorigenic potential of ARID2, encoding a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is largely unexplored in CRC. shRNA-mediated ARID2 knockdown performed in different CRC cell lines resulted in significant alterations in transcript levels of cancer-related target genes. More importantly, ARID2 knockdown promoted several tumorigenic features including cell viability, proliferation, ability to override contact inhibition of growth, and migration besides significantly increasing tumor formation ability in nude mice. The observed gain in tumorigenic features was rescued upon ectopic expression of wild type but not mutant ARID2. Analyses of the TCGA pan-cancer dataset revealed several modes of ARID2 inactivation and of the CRC dataset revealed poorer survival in patients with ARID2 alterations. We therefore propose ARID2 as a novel tumor suppressor in CRC."

We reviewed pathology reports from 53 animals that stranded in the eastern Pacific Ocean and Hawaii between 2004 and 2013 and used data from 35 animals that stranded from 2001 to 2017 to assess association with morphometrics, blubber thickness, body condition and cause of death. Of the 53 cases, cause of death was determined for 22 (42%) and nine additional animals demonstrated findings of significant importance for population health. Causes of calf mortalities included infectious disease, nutritional, and congenital malformations. Mortalities in sub-adults were due to trauma, malnutrition, and infectious disease and in adults due to bacterial infections, emaciation and blunt force trauma. Death related to human interaction was found in every age class. Important incidental findings included concurrent sarcocystosis and toxoplasmosis, uterine leiomyoma, vertebral periosteal proliferations, cookiecutter shark ( Isistius sp.) bite wounds, excessive tooth wear and an ingested fish hook. Blubber thickness increased significantly with body length (all p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, there was no relationship between body length and an index of body condition (BCI). BCI was higher in animals that died from trauma. This study establishes a baseline for understanding health, nutritional status and causes of mortality in stranded killer whales. Given the evidence of direct human interactions on all age classes, in order to be most successful recovery efforts should address the threat of human interactions, especially for small endangered groups of killer whales that occur in close proximity to large human populations, interact with recreational and commercial fishers and transit established shipping lanes."

https://openalex.org/W3109746124,"Sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM) is the most common idiopathic inflammatory myopathy, and several reports have suggested that mitochondrial abnormalities are involved in its etiology. We recruited 9 sIBM patients and found significant histological changes and an elevation of growth differential factor 15 (GDF15), a marker of mitochondrial disease, strongly suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction. Bioenergetic analysis of sIBM patient myoblasts revealed impaired mitochondrial function. Decreased ATP production, reduced mitochondrial size and reduced mitochondrial dynamics were also observed in sIBM myoblasts. Cell vulnerability to oxidative stress also suggested the existence of mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochonic acid-5 (MA-5) increased the cellular ATP level, reduced mitochondrial ROS, and provided protection against sIBM myoblast death. MA-5 also improved the survival of sIBM skin fibroblasts as well as mitochondrial morphology and dynamics in these cells. The reduction in the gene expression levels of Opa1 and Drp1 was also reversed by MA-5, suggesting the modification of the fusion/fission process. These data suggest that MA-5 may provide an alternative therapeutic strategy for treating not only mitochondrial diseases but also sIBM."
https://openalex.org/W3106764127,"Background Even though there is low coverage of maternal health services such as antenatal care and skilled birth attendant delivery as well as poor sanitary practice during delivery in Ethiopia, the proportion of births protected by the tetanus vaccine is low. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the determinants of births protected against neonatal tetanus in Ethiopia. Objective To assess the determinants of births protected against neonatal tetanus in Ethiopia. Method The study was based on secondary data analysis of the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey 2016 data. A weighted sample of 7590 women who gave birth within five years preceding the survey was used for analysis. We conducted a multilevel analysis, due to the hierarchical nature of the data. Variables with p-value &lt;0.05 in the multivariable analysis were declared to be significantly associated with having births protected against neonatal tetanus. Result In this study, mothers with primary education [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.23; 95%CI: 1.04, 1.44] and secondary and above education [AOR = 1.36; 95%CI: 1.06, 1.73], media exposure [AOR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.15, 1.58], not perceiving distance from the health facility as a big problem [AOR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.08,1.42], one antenatal care (ANC) visit [AOR = 1.56; 95%CI: 2.71, 4.68], two to three ANC visit [AOR = 11.82; 95%CI: 9.94,14.06], and four and more ANC visit [AOR = 15.25; 95%CI: 12.74, 18.26], being in Amhara [AOR = 0.59; 95%CI: 0.38,0.92], Afar [AO = 0.41; 95%CI: 0.25,0.66], and Harari [AOR = 1.88; 95%CI: 1.15,3.07] regions, being in communities with higher level of women education [AOR = 1.25; 95%CI: 1.03,1.52], and higher level of media exposure [AOR = 1.22; 95%CI: 1.01,1.48] were significant predictors of having a protected birth against neonatal tetanus. Conclusion In this study, both individual level and community level factors were associated with having protected birth against neonatal tetanus. Therefore, strengthening maternal health services such as ANC visits and interventions related to increasing media campaigns regarding tetanus could increase the immunization against tetanus among reproductive-age women. In addition, it is also better to give attention to those reproductive age group women from remote areas and also better to distribute maternal services fairly and equally between regions."
https://openalex.org/W3107374123,"Background Underweight is one form of indicators of under-nutrition, which results from the poor nutrient intake and underlying health problems. Its impact is beyond an individual and extends to a country level. It has been known from the literature that underweight has a negative effect on income and development of a country. In the context of Ethiopia, factors predicting underweight remain unknown and there is a paucity of evidence on geographical distribution of underweight among individuals aged 15–49 years. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the geographic distribution of underweight and its associated factors among individuals aged 15–49 years in Ethiopia. Methods Secondary data analysis was done on a data set consisting of 28,450 individuals and obtained from the Ethiopian Demography and Health Survey (EDHS) 2016. The spatial distribution of underweight across the country was identified by ArcGIS software. Hotspots analysis was done using Getis-Ord Gi* statistic within ArcGIS. In SaTScan software, the Bernoulli model was fitted by Kulldorff’s methods to identify the purely spatial clusters of underweight. A binary logistic regression was applied to determine factors associated with being underweight. Result In Ethiopia, the spatial distribution of underweight was clustered with Global Moran’s I = 0.79 at p-value &lt; 0.0001. The highest underweight clusters were observed in Tigray, Gambella, eastern part of Amhara, and western and central part of Afar regions. Male individuals [AOR = 1.21; 95% CI: (1.15 1.28)], never married [AOR = 1.14; 95% CI: (1.05, 1.24)], rural residents [AOR = 1.32; 95% CI: (1.18, 1.47)], rich [AOR = 0.85; 95% CI: (0.76, 0.94)], cigarette smoking [AOR = 1.25; 95% CI: (1.07, 1.46)], drinking treated water [AOR = 0.91; 95% CI: (0.83, 0.99)] and open filed defecation [AOR = 1.17; 95% CI: (1.08, 1.26)] were found to have a significant association with being underweight. Conclusions There was a significant clustering of underweight among individuals aged 15–49 years. Gender, age, marital status, place of residence, wealth index, cigarette smoking, using untreated water and types of toilet were the significant factors of being underweight. Therefore, effective public health interventions like building safe and supportive environments for nutrition, providing socio-economic protection and nutrition-related education for poor and rural resident would be better to mitigate these situations and associated risk factors in hot spot areas. In addition, policymakers should strengthen and promote nutrition sensitive policies and activities in order to alleviate the underlying and basic causes of underweight."
https://openalex.org/W3106552829,"Although circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of various tumors, clinical correlation of cfDNA with gastric cancer has not been fully understood. To address this, we developed a highly sensitive cfDNA capture system by integrating polydopamine (PDA) and silica. PDA-silica hybrids incorporated different molecular interactions to a single system, enhancing cfDNA capture by 1.34-fold compared to the conventional silica-based approach (p = 0.001), which was confirmed using cell culture supernatants. A clinical study using human plasma samples revealed that the diagnostic accuracy of the new system to be superior than the commercially available cfDNA kit, as well as other serum antigen tests. Among the cancer patients, plasma cfDNA levels exhibited a good correlation with the size of a tumor. cfDNA was also predicative of distant metastasis, as the median cfDNA levels of metastatic cancer patients were ~60-fold higher than those without metastasis (p = 0.008). Furthermore, high concordance between tissue biopsy and cfDNA genomic analysis was found, as HER2 expression in cfDNA demonstrated an area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.976 (p &lt;0.001) for detecting patients with HER2-positive tumors. The new system also revealed high prognostic capability of cfDNA, as the concentration of cfDNA was highly associated with the survival outcomes. Our novel technology demonstrates the potential to achieve efficient detection of cfDNA that may serve as a reliable biomarker for gastric tumor."

In the ensuing weeks, American jurisdictions attempted to manage disease spread on a regional basis using non-pharmaceutical interventions (i.e., social distancing), as uneven disease burden across the expansive geography of the United States exerted different implications for policy management in different regions. While Arizona policymakers relied initially on state-by-state national modeling projections from different groups outside of the state, we sought to create a state-specific model using a mathematical framework that ties disease surveillance with the future burden on Arizona’s healthcare system. Our framework uses a compartmental system dynamics model using a SEIRD framework that accounts for multiple types of disease manifestations for the COVID-19 infection, as well as the observed time delay in epidemiological findings following public policy enactments. We use a compartment initialization logic coupled with a fitting technique to construct projections for key metrics to guide public health policy, including exposures, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths under a variety of social reopening scenarios. Our approach makes use of X-factor fitting and backcasting methods to construct meaningful and reliable models with minimal available data in order to provide timely policy guidance in the early phases of a pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3108968713,"Lebanon has approximately one million Syrian refugees (SR) registered with the United Nations High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) and an unknown number of unregistered SR, who cannot benefit from formal assistance. This study aimed to examine the livelihoods, coping strategies, and access to healthcare among SR based on registration status and accompanying formal assistance. A mixed-method approach with more emphasis on the qualitative design was adopted. A purposive convenient sampling approach was used to recruit SR from informal tented settlements (ITS) in the Beqaa region in Lebanon. Data collection included 19 focus group discussions (FGDs) that were conducted with participants, who were further divided into three groups: registered refugees with assistance, registered without assistance and unregistered. Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with key informants from humanitarian organizations. All interviews and FGDs were audio recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. SR were highly dependent on formal assistance when received, albeit being insufficient. Regardless of registration status, refugees resorted to informal livelihood strategies, including informal employment, child labor, early marriage, and accruing debt. Poor living conditions and food insecurity were reported among all SR. Limited healthcare access and high out-of-pocket costs led to limited use of antenatal care services, prioritizing life-threatening conditions, and resorting to alternative sources of healthcare. Severity of these conditions and their adverse health consequences were especially pronounced among unregistered refugees. Our findings shed light on the economic and health disparities among marginalized SR, with the lack of registration and formal assistance increasing their vulnerability. More tailored and sustainable humanitarian programs are needed to target the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups."
https://openalex.org/W3110413302,"Objectives Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also known as presbycusis, is a chronic disorder characterized by impairment of the transduction of acoustic signals. This study analysed the prevalence and demographic characteristics of ARHL in the Korean population. Methods We used the data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) from 2009 to 2012 and analysed the association between age and hearing impairment. A total of 16,799 adults were selected for the current study. Physical examinations, blood tests, otoscopic examinations, and hearing tests were performed. The demographic variables included age, gender, obesity, economic status, education level, noise exposure history, and underlying diseases. Results Among 16,799 participants, the prevalence of unilateral hearing loss was 8% (1,349 people), and bilateral hearing loss was 5.9% (989 people). Men were 53.4% more likely to have hearing loss than women. Age and underlying diseases, like hypertension, diabetes, and abdominal obesity, were significantly associated with hearing loss (P &lt; 0.0001). Further, mental health factors, such as cognitive function, depression, and suicidal ideation, were related to hearing loss. The prevalence of hearing loss increased with advancing years, especially in the high frequency of 6 kHz, with a sharply increase in patients aged 65 and over. Conclusion The analysis of auditory performance in the Korean population confirmed the association of high-frequency hearing loss with advancing age. A threshold of 6 kHz should be included to correctly diagnose hearing impairment in elderly patients. Patients with ARHL should be provided with suitable aural rehabilitation that includes active high-frequency control."
https://openalex.org/W3107816874,"Riboswitches, generally located in the 5’-leader of bacterial mRNAs, direct expression via a small molecule-dependent structural switch that informs the transcriptional or translational machinery. While the structure and function of riboswitch effector-binding (aptamer) domains have been intensely studied, only recently have the requirements for efficient linkage between small molecule binding and the structural switch in the cellular and co-transcriptional context begun to be actively explored. To address this aspect of riboswitch function, we have performed a structure-guided mutagenic analysis of the B . subtilis pbuE adenine-responsive riboswitch, one of the simplest riboswitches that employs a strand displacement switching mechanism to regulate transcription. Using a cell-based fluorescent protein reporter assay to assess ligand-dependent regulatory activity in E . coli , these studies revealed previously unrecognized features of the riboswitch. Within the aptamer domain, local and long-range conformational dynamics influenced by sequences within helices have a significant effect upon efficient regulatory switching. Sequence features of the expression platform including the pre-aptamer leader sequence, a toehold helix and an RNA polymerase pause site all serve to promote strong ligand-dependent regulation. By optimizing these features, we were able to improve the performance of the B . subtilis pbuE riboswitch in E . coli from 5.6-fold induction of reporter gene expression by the wild type riboswitch to over 120-fold in the top performing designed variant. Together, these data point to sequence and structural features distributed throughout the riboswitch required to strike a balance between rates of ligand binding, transcription and secondary structural switching via a strand exchange mechanism and yield new insights into the design of artificial riboswitches."
https://openalex.org/W3108862854,"Introduction Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) taken by People Living with HIV (PLHIV) protects against active tuberculosis (TB). Despite its recommendation, data is scarce on the uptake of IPT among PLHIV and factors associated with treatment outcomes. We aimed at determining the proportion of PLHIV initiated on IPT, assessed TB screening practices during and after IPT and IPT treatment outcomes. Methods A retrospective cohort study of a representative sample of PLHIV initiated on IPT between July 2015 and June 2018 in Kenya. For PLHIV initiated on IPT during the study period, we abstracted patient IPT uptake data from the National data warehouse. In contrast, we obtained information on socio-demographic, TB screening practices, IPT initiation, follow up, and outcomes from health facilities' patient record cards, IPT cards, and IPT registers. Further, we assessed baseline characteristics as potential correlates of developing active TB during and after treatment and IPT completion using multivariable logistic regression. Results From the data warehouse, 138,442 PLHIV were enrolled into ART during the study period and initiated 95,431 (68.9%) into IPT. We abstracted 4708 patients’ files initiated on IPT, out of which 3891(82.6%) had IPT treatment outcomes documented, 4356(92.5%) had ever screened for TB at every clinic visit, and 4,243(90.1%) had documentation of TB screening on the IPT tool before IPT initiation. 3712(95.4%) of patients with documented IPT treatment outcomes completed their treatment. 42(0.89%) of the abstracted patients developed active TB,16(38.1%) during, and 26(61.9%) after completing IPT. Follow up for active TB at 6-month post-IPT completion was done for 2729(73.5%) of patients with IPT treatment outcomes. Sex, Viral load suppression, and clinic type were associated with TB development (p&lt;0.05). Levels 4, 5, FBO, and private facilities and IPT prescription practices were associated with IPT completion (p&lt;0.05). Conclusion IPT initiation stands at two-thirds of the PLHIV, with a high completion rate. TB screening practices were better during IPT than after completion. Development of active TB during and after IPT emphasizes the need for a keen follow up."
https://openalex.org/W3110385911,"Curiosity-driven, basic biological research “…performed without thought of practical ends…” establishes fundamental conceptual frameworks for future technological and medical breakthroughs. Traditionally, curiosity-driven research in biological sciences has utilized experimental organisms chosen for their tractability and suitability for studying the question of interest. This approach leverages the diversity of life to uncover working solutions (adaptations) to problems encountered by living things, and evolutionary context as to the extent to which these solutions may be generalized to other species. Despite the well-documented success of this approach, funding portfolios of United States granting agencies are increasingly filled with studies on a few species for which cutting-edge molecular tools are available (genetic model organisms). While this narrow focus may be justified for biomedically-focused funding bodies such as the National Institutes of Health, it is critical that robust federal support for curiosity-driven research using diverse experimental organisms be maintained by agencies such as the National Science Foundation. Using the disciplines of neurobiology and behavioral research as an example, this study finds that NSF grant awards have declined in association with a decrease in the proportion of grants funded for experimental, rather than genetic model organism research. The decline in use of experimental organisms in the literature mirrors but predates the shift grant funding. Today’s dominance of genetic model organisms was thus initiated by researchers themselves and/or by publication peer review and editorial preferences, and was further reinforced by pressure from granting agencies, academic employers, and the scientific community."
https://openalex.org/W3107024863,"Introduction While U.S. jails are critical sites for engagement in HCV care, short lengths-of-stay often do not permit treatment in jail. Therefore, linkage to HCV care after incarceration is crucial. However, little is known about HCV treatment acceptability among justice-involved individuals in U.S. jails. The goal of this study was to understand knowledge, attitudes, and acceptability of HCV treatment among people living with HCV in the New York City (NYC) jail system. Methods We recruited 36 HCV-antibody-positive individuals in the NYC jails using clinical data reports and performed semi-structured interviews to explore participants’ attitudes toward HCV treatment in jail and following return to the community. We continued interviews until reaching thematic saturation and analyzed interviews using an inductive, thematic approach. Results Participants were mostly male, Latina/o, with a mean age of 40 years. Nearly all were aware they were HCV antibody-positive. Two thirds of participants had some awareness of the availability of new HCV therapies. Key themes included: 1) variable knowledge of new HCV therapies affecting attitudes toward HCV treatment, 2) the importance of other incarcerated individuals in communicating HCV-related knowledge, 3) vulnerability during incarceration and fear of treatment interruption, 4) concern for relapse to active drug use and HCV reinfection, 5) competing priorities (such as other medical comorbidities, ongoing substance use, and housing), 6) social support and the importance of family. Conclusions Patient-centered approaches to increase treatment uptake in jail settings should focus on promoting HCV-related knowledge including leveraging peers for knowledge dissemination. In addition, transitional care programs should ensure people living with HCV in jail have tailored discharge plans focused on competing priorities such as housing instability, social support, and treatment of substance use disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3109643332,"The evaluation of cultivars using multi-environment trials (MET) is an important step in plant breeding programs. One of the objectives of these evaluations is to understand the genotype by environment interaction (GEI). A method of determining the effect of GEI on the performance of cultivars is based on studies of adaptability and stability. Initial studies were based on linear regression; however, these methodologies have limitations, mainly in trials with genetic or statistical unbalanced, heterogeneity of residual variances, and genetic covariance. An alternative would be the use of random regression models (RRM), in which the behavior of the genotypes is characterized as a reaction norm using longitudinal data or repeated measurements and information regarding a covariance function. The objective of this work was the application of RRM in the study of the behavior of common bean cultivars using a MET, based on Legendre polynomials and genotype-ideotype distances. We used a set of 13 trials, which were classified as unfavorable or favorable environments. The results revealed that RRM enables the prediction of the genotypic values of cultivars in environments where they were not evaluated with high accuracy values, thereby circumventing the unbalanced of the experiments. From these values, it was possible to measure the genotypic adaptability according to ideotypes, according to their reaction norms. In addition, the stability of the cultivars can be interpreted as variation in the behavior of the ideotype. The use of ideotypes based on real data allowed a better comparison of the performance of cultivars across environments. The use of RRM in plant breeding is a good alternative to understand the behavior of cultivars in a MET, especially when we want to quantify the adaptability and stability of genotypes."

Short RNA helices are unwound in a single ATPase cycle, but the ATP requirement for more complex RNA structural rearrangements is unknown. Here we measure the amount of ATP used for native refolding of a misfolded group I intron ribozyme by CYT-19, a Neurospora crassa DEAD-box protein that functions as a general chaperone for mitochondrial group I introns. By comparing the rates of ATP hydrolysis and ribozyme refolding, we find that several hundred ATP molecules are hydrolyzed during refolding of each ribozyme molecule. After subtracting nonproductive ATP hydrolysis that occurs in the absence of ribozyme refolding, we find that approximately 100 ATPs are hydrolyzed per refolded RNA as a consequence of interactions specific to the misfolded ribozyme. This value is insensitive to changes in ATP and CYT-19 concentration and decreases with decreasing ribozyme stability. Because of earlier findings that ∼90% of global ribozyme unfolding cycles lead back to the kinetically preferred misfolded conformation and are not observed, we estimate that each global unfolding cycle consumes ∼10 ATPs. Our results indicate that CYT-19 functions as a general RNA chaperone by using a stochastic, energy-intensive mechanism to promote RNA unfolding and refolding, suggesting an evolutionary convergence with protein chaperones.

Indeed, it has been shown that DEAD-box proteins can destabilize RNA tertiary contacts by ATP-independent binding to a dsRNA helical segment that is exposed transiently by spontaneous loss of tertiary contacts, and many DEAD-box proteins possess ATP-independent annealing activity (1Linder P.

The intervening sequence RNA of Tetrahymena is an enzyme.Science. 1986; 231: 470-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). After folding is initiated with Mg2+ ions in vitro, the ribozyme folds predominantly to an inactive, misfolded conformation, which then slowly refolds to the thermodynamically favored native state (39Russell R. Herschlag D. New pathways in folding of the Tetrahymena group I RNA enzyme.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 40Russell R. Herschlag D. Probing the folding landscape of the Tetrahymena ribozyme: commitment to form the native conformation is late in the folding pathway.J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 839-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This long-lived misfolded structure is structurally similar to the native structure, including all of the native secondary structure elements and five long-range tertiary contacts (41Russell R. Das R. Suh H. Travers K. Laederach A. Engelhardt M. Herschlag D. The paradoxical behavior of a highly structured misfolded intermediate in RNA folding.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The origin of misfolding appears to be topological, with two single-stranded elements being incorrectly crossed in the center of the ribozyme (41Russell R. Das R. Suh H. Travers K. Laederach A.

Biol. 2013; 425: 2670-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because this topological error is surrounded by a network of native interactions, refolding to the native state requires extensive unfolding that includes disruption of all five tertiary contacts and the P3 helix in the ribozyme core (41Russell R. Das R. Suh H. Travers K. Laederach A. Engelhardt M. Herschlag D. The paradoxical behavior of a highly structured misfolded intermediate in RNA folding.J. Mol.

Biol. 2013; 425: 2670-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although spontaneous refolding is extremely slow, on the time scale of hours, CYT-19 accelerates this transition in an ATP-dependent manner by disrupting the misfolded structure (25Bhaskaran H. Russell R. Kinetic redistribution of native and misfolded RNAs by a DEAD-box chaperone.Nature. 2007; 449: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 31Tijerina P. Bhaskaran H. Russell R. Nonspecific binding to structured RNA and preferential unwinding of an exposed helix by the CYT-19 protein, a DEAD-box RNA chaperone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16698-16703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CYT-19 unfolds the misfolded intermediate much more readily than the native ribozyme, apparently because the misfolded structure is less stable (25Bhaskaran H. Russell R. Kinetic redistribution of native and misfolded RNAs by a DEAD-box chaperone.Nature. 2007; 449: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with the role of RNA structural stability in controlling the CYT-19–mediated unfolding rate, CYT-19 can also efficiently disrupt the native ribozyme if it is destabilized by mutations (25Bhaskaran H. Russell R. Kinetic redistribution of native and misfolded RNAs by a DEAD-box chaperone.Nature. 2007; 449: 1014-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33Jarmoskaite I. Bhaskaran H. Seifert S.

Studies with ribozyme variants that vary in local or global stability suggest that CYT-19 preferentially interacts with exposed RNA helices, which are present more frequently in RNAs with a weakened tertiary structure (28Pan C. Potratz J.P. Cannon B. Simpson Z.B. Ziehr J.L. Tijerina P. Russell R. DEAD-box helicase proteins disrupt RNA tertiary structure through helix capture.PLoS Biol. 2014; 12e1001981Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31Tijerina P. Bhaskaran H. Russell R. Nonspecific binding to structured RNA and preferential unwinding of an exposed helix by the CYT-19 protein, a DEAD-box RNA chaperone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16698-16703Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 33Jarmoskaite I. Bhaskaran H. Seifert S. Russell R.

Thus, CYT-19 is suggested to unfold the ribozyme structure by capturing and unwinding ribozyme helices that are transiently exposed by spontaneous losses of tertiary structure. However, it is unknown how many such local disruptions and ATP-dependent steps are required for unfolding. It is also unknown whether global disruption of the ribozyme structure is achieved via a well-defined sequence of steps or a multitude of pathways that may involve predominantly spurious interactions of CYT-19 with the RNA. Here we probe the RNA chaperone mechanism of CYT-19 by measuring the number of ATP molecules that are hydrolyzed during native refolding of the misfolded ribozyme. We show that hundreds of ATP molecules are hydrolyzed for every ribozyme molecule that reaches the native state. Further dissection of this value suggests that most of the ATPase activity arises from nonproductive RNA unwinding events that are unlinked to the folding transition, as well as from futile cycles of unfolding that result in reformation of the misfolded structure. We suggest that the energy-intensive nature of the refolding activity is inherent to chaperones that function with broad substrate specificity, both RNA chaperones and protein chaperones. To determine the amount of ATP consumed by CYT-19 during native refolding of the misfolded Tetrahymena ribozyme (the ATP utilization value), we first surveyed conditions to maximize the CYT-19–dependent and ATP-dependent acceleration of refolding above the spontaneous rate, such that as much as possible of the observed refolding could be attributed to CYT-19 activity. To measure the refolding rates, we used a previously established two-stage folding assay (43Potratz J.P. Russell R. RNA catalysis as a probe for chaperone activity of DEAD-box helicases.Methods Enzymol. 2012; 511: 111-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 44Wan Y. Mitchell D. Russell R. Catalytic activity as a probe of native RNA folding.Methods Enzymol. 2009; 468: 195-218Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ribozyme was first misfolded by a brief incubation with 10 mM Mg2+, and then refolding was initiated by dilution of Mg2+ to 2 mM and simultaneous addition of CYT-19 and ATP (stage 1). At various time points, the folding reaction was stopped by increasing the Mg2+ concentration and adding proteinase K. The fraction of the native ribozyme present at each time point was determined by cleavage of a short radiolabeled oligonucleotide substrate (CCCUCUA5) that base pairs with the 5′ end of the ribozyme, mimicking the 5′ splice site of the natural self-splicing reaction (stage 2). Because the substrate binds tightly and with comparable rate constants to both the native and misfolded conformations, the fraction of the substrate that is cleaved rapidly by the native ribozyme reports on the fraction of the ribozyme that is present in the native state. By measuring the refolding rates at several CYT-19 and ATP concentrations, we found that the refolding rate was increased up to ∼6-fold at 2 mM Mg2+, 200 nM ribozyme, ≥1 mM ATP, and ≥500 nM CYT-19 at 25 °C (Fig. 1, B–C). Increasing the CYT-19 concentration further did not increase the refolding rate. To determine the number of ATPs hydrolyzed per refolded ribozyme, we measured the ATPase rate during refolding at concentrations of CYT-19 (500 nM) and ATP (500 μM) close to saturation, corresponding to a 4.4-fold acceleration of refolding (Fig. 1, B–C). The ATP utilization value was then determined by dividing the initial rate of ATP hydrolysis by the initial rate of CYT-19–mediated ribozyme refolding, yielding 330 ATP molecules per ribozyme molecule (Fig. 1, D–E). As demonstrated in the subsequent sections, changes in the ribozyme and CYT-19 concentrations did not strongly affect the ATP utilization. The ATP utilization value of 330 likely includes both productive and futile ATP hydrolysis events, i.e., ATP hydrolysis events that contribute to misfolded ribozyme unfolding and some that do not contribute to ribozyme unfolding. Previous measurements revealed robust stimulation of the ATPase activity of CYT-19 by the native ribozyme, despite a lack of detectable unfolding (33Jarmoskaite I. Bhaskaran H. Seifert S. Russell R. DEAD-box protein CYT-19 is activated by exposed helices in a group I intron RNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: E2928-E2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Much of this nonproductive ATPase activity arises from interactions of CYT-19 with two helices that protrude from the folded structure, as truncations substantially reduced the ATPase stimulation (ΔP6b+ΔP9.2; see Fig. 1A) (33Jarmoskaite I. Bhaskaran H. Seifert S. Russell R. DEAD-box protein CYT-19 is activated by exposed helices in a group I intron RNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2014; 111: E2928-E2936Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These helices are formed in the misfolded structure and are expected to be similarly accessible, providing a likely source of futile ATP hydrolysis events (41Russell R. Das R. Suh H. Travers K. Laederach A. Engelhardt M. Herschlag D. The paradoxical behavior of a highly structured misfolded intermediate in RNA folding.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). To test the alternative possibility that CYT-19 interactions with these helices can be productive for misfolded ribozyme unfolding, we measured CYT-19–dependent refolding of the truncation mutant ΔP6b+ΔP9.2 (Fig. S1). We found that refolding of the mutant was at least as fast as refolding of the wild-type ribozyme, providing no evidence for a productive role of these helices in refolding. In light of these results, we reasoned that the ATPase activity with the native ribozyme provides an estimate of the ‘background’ ATPase activity that is not associated with productive unfolding. A comparison of the initial ATPase rates measured with the misfolded or native ribozyme under identical conditions revealed a 50% enhancement of ATPase activity in the presence of the misfolded ribozyme [(6.8 ± 0.3) μM/min versus (4.5 ± 0.3) μM/min; Table S1], most simply suggesting that approximately two-thirds of the ATP hydrolysis events with the misfolded ribozyme result from nonproductive interactions with constitutively accessible regions, with the remaining one-third occurring during unfolding of the misfolded RNA. This latter value corresponds to approximately 110 ATP molecules hydrolyzed per ribozyme molecule refolded. If the increased CYT-19–dependent ATP hydrolysis rate observed with the misfolded ribozyme resulted from CYT-19–mediated ribozyme unfolding, we would expect the ATPase rate to decrease over the time course of the refolding reaction, eventually reaching the lower level of stimulation characteristic of the native ribozyme. To test this prediction, we initiated refolding of the misfolded ribozyme and monitored ATP hydrolysis over a time sufficient for complete refolding, as determined by the ribozyme catalytic activity assay. In parallel, we measured the ATPase activity in a reaction in which the ribozyme was prefolded to the native state. The data revealed rapid ATPase activity in the presence of the misfolded ribozyme, which slowed over time until it matched the rate measured with the native ribozyme (Fig. 2A). Some curvature was also present in the ATPase time course obtained with the native ribozyme, most likely due to ATP depletion and inhibition by accumulated ADP (45Lorsch J.R. Herschlag D. The DEAD box protein eIF4A. 1.

A plot of the difference between the amounts of ATP hydrolyzed in the two reactions gave a single-exponential curve with a rate constant that was indistinguishable from"
https://openalex.org/W3109503472,"The soybean is agro-economically the most important among all cultivated legume crops, and its seed color is considered one of the most attractive factors in the selection-by-breeders. Thus, genome-wide identification of genes and loci associated with seed colors is critical for the precision breeding of crop soybeans. To dissect seed pigmentation-associated genomic loci and genes, we employed dual approaches by combining reference-based genome-wide association study (rbGWAS) and k-mer-based reference-free GWAS (rfGWAS) with 438 Glycine accessions. The dual analytical strategy allowed us to identify four major genomic loci (designated as SP1 - SP4 in this study) associated with the seed colors of soybeans. The k-mer analysis enabled us to find an important recombination event that occurred between subtilisin and I-cluster B in the soybean genome, which could describe a special structural feature of i i allele within the I locus ( SP3 ). Importantly, mapping analyses of both mRNAs and small RNAs allowed us to reveal that the subtilisin-CHS1/CHS3 chimeric transcripts generate and act as an initiator towards ‘mirtron (i.e., intron-harboring miRNA precursor)’-triggered silencing of chalcone synthase (CHS) genes. Consequently, the results led us to propose a working model of ‘mirtron-triggered gene silencing (MTGS)’ to elucidate a long-standing puzzle in the genome-wide CHS gene silencing mechanism. In summary, our study reports four major genomic loci, lists of key genes and genome-wide variations that are associated with seed pigmentation in soybeans. In addition, we propose that the MTGS mechanism plays a crucial role in the genome-wide silencing of CHS genes, thereby suggesting a clue to currently predominant soybean cultivars with the yellow seed coat. Finally, this study will provide a broad insight into the interactions and correlations among seed color-associated genes and loci within the context of anthocyanin biosynthetic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3107409388,"During development of the Caenorhabditis elegans gonad, the gonadal leader cells, called distal tip cells (DTCs), migrate in a U-shaped pattern to form the U-shaped gonad arms. The ADAMTS (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs) family metalloproteases MIG-17 and GON-1 are required for correct DTC migration. Mutations in mig-17 result in misshapen gonads due to the misdirected DTC migration, and mutations in gon-1 result in shortened and swollen gonads due to the premature termination of DTC migration. Although the phenotypes shown by mig-17 and gon-1 mutants are very different from one another, mutations that result in amino acid substitutions in the same basement membrane protein genes, emb-9/collagen IV a1, let-2/collagen IV a2 and fbl-1/fibulin-1, were identified as genetic suppressors of mig-17 and gon-1 mutants. To understand the roles shared by these two proteases, we examined the effects of the mig-17 suppressors on gon-1 and the effects of the gon-1 suppressors and enhancers on mig-17 gonadal defects. Some of the emb-9, let-2 and fbl-1 mutations suppressed both mig-17 and gon-1, whereas others acted only on mig-17 or gon-1. These results suggest that mig-17 and gon-1 have their specific functions as well as functions commonly shared between them for gonad formation. The levels of collagen IV accumulation in the DTC basement membrane were significantly higher in the gon-1 mutants as compared with wild type and were reduced to the wild-type levels when combined with suppressor mutations, but not with enhancer mutations, suggesting that the ability to reduce collagen IV levels is important for gon-1 suppression."

LaNt α31 was also found throughout the vasculature of most tissues, with enrichment in reticular-like fibres in the extracellular matrix surrounding large vessels. A similar matrix pattern was observed around the terminal ducts in the breast and around the alveolar epithelium in the lung, where basement membrane staining was also evident. Specific enrichment of LaNt α31 was identified in sub-populations of cells of the kidney, liver, pancreas, and spleen, with variations in intensity between different cell types in the collecting ducts and glomeruli of the kidney. Intriguingly, LaNt α31 immunoreactivity was also evident in neurons of the central nervous system, in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, and spinal cord. Together these findings suggest that LaNt α31 may be functionally relevant in a wider range of tissue contexts than previously anticipated, and the data provides a valuable basis for investigation into this interesting protein."

The B7A (O148:H28 CS6+LT+ST+) strain is important for vaccine development. We sought to refine the B7A model by identifying a dose and fasting regimen consistently inducing moderate-severe diarrhea.An initial cohort of 28 subjects was randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive B7A following an overnight fast at doses of 108 or 109 colony forming units (cfu) or a 90-minute fast at doses of 109 or 1010 cfu. A second cohort included naïve and rechallenged subjects who had moderate-severe diarrhea and were given the target regimen. Immune responses to important ETEC antigens were assessed.Among subjects receiving 108 cfu of B7A, overnight fast, or 109 cfu, 90-minute fast, 42.9% (3/7) had moderate-severe diarrhea. Higher attack rates (71.4%; 5/7) occurred in subjects receiving 109 cfu, overnight fast, or 1010 cfu, 90-minute fast. Upon rechallenge with 109 cfu of B7A, overnight fast, 5/11 (45.5%) had moderate-severe diarrhea; the attack rate among concurrently challenge naïve subjects was 57.9% (11/19). Anti-CS6, O148 LPS and LT responses were modest across all groups.An overnight fast enabled a reduction in the B7A inoculum dose; however, the attack rate was inconsistent and protection upon rechallenge was minimal."
https://openalex.org/W3109369855,"The expansion of woody plants into grasslands and old fields is often ascribed to fire suppression and heavy grazing, especially by domestic livestock. However, it is also recognized that nutrient availability and interspecific competition with grasses and other woody plants play a role in certain habitats. I examined potential factors causing range- and niche expansion by the eastern redcedar Juniperus virginiana , the most widespread conifer in the eastern United States, in multifactorial experiments in a greenhouse. Historical records suggest that the eastern redcedar is a pioneer forest species, and may be replaced as the forest increases in tree density due to shading. Another possible factor that affects its distribution may be nutrient availability, which is higher in old fields and other disturbed lands than in undisturbed habitats. In its historic range, eastern redcedars are particularly abundant on limestone outcrops, often termed ‘cedar barrens’. However, the higher abundance on limestone could be due to reduced interspecific competition rather than a preference for high pH substrates. I manipulated shade, fertilization, lime, and interspecific competition with a common dominant tree, the post oak Quercus stellata . In a separate experiment, I manipulated fire and grass competition. I measured growth rates (height and diameter) and above- and belowground biomass at the end of both experiments. I also measured total non-structural carbohydrates and nitrogen in these plants. Shade was the most important factor limiting the growth rates and biomass of eastern redcedars. I also found that there were significant declines in nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates when shaded. These results are consistent with the notion that the eastern redcedar is a pioneer forest species, and that shade is the reason that these redcedars are replaced by other tree species. In the second experiment, I found that a single fire had a negative effect on young trees. There was no significant effect of competition with grass, perhaps because the competitive effect was shading by grasses and not nutrient depletion. Overall, the effects of shade were far more apparent than the effects of fire."
https://openalex.org/W3108383672,"Background Information about the use of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of male urethritis is scarce. The current study aims to evaluate the performance of flow cytometry on first-voided urine in males with infectious urethritis ( Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Mycoplasma genitalium and Trichomonas vaginalis ). Methods Male patients of the Andrology Centre (Tartu University Hospital, Estonia) were recruited during the period March 2015 –January 2018. Cases included 306 patients with infectious urethritis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , Neisseria gonorrhoeae , Mycoplasma genitalium and/or Trichomonas vaginalis . The control group consisted of 192 patients without uro-genital complaints, negative tests for C . trachomatis , N . gonorrhoeae , M . genitalium and T . vaginalis from first-voided urine and no inflammation in first-voided urine, mid-stream urine and urine after prostate massage. C . trachomatis , N . gonorrhoeae , M . genitalium and T . vaginalis were detected from first-voided urine using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. First-voided urine was analysed using urine particle analyzer Sysmex UF-500i. Results The most prevalent infection was chlamydia (64.1%), followed by Mycoplasma genitalium (20.9%), gonorrhoea (7.8%) and trichomoniasis (1.6%). Gonorrhoea caused the highest flow-cytometric leucocyte/bacteria count, followed by chlamydia and Mycoplasma genitalium . Trichomonas vaginalis showed nearly absent inflammation in first-voided urine. Using an empiric flow-cytometry diagnostic threshold for urethritis in first-voided urine (leucocytes ≥ 15/μl and bacteria ≥ 20/μl) the total calculated sensitivity was over 90%. However, when applying such criteria for deciding whether to perform first-voided urine PCR for C . trachomatis , N . gonorrhoeae , M . genitalium and T . vaginalis or not, we could miss 23 cases with infectious urethritis that makes up 7,5% of all proven cases. Conclusions Flow cytometry of first-voided urine can be considered as a rapid and objective screening method in case of suspected male infectious urethritis."
https://openalex.org/W3109797976,"At the intersection of research areas on health and employment, little attention has been paid on employment quality among people living with HIV (PLWH). The objective of the current study is to identify critical factors and empirically examine their effects on employment quality among PLWH. Based on the social-ecological perspective, we identified negative self-image, workplace discrimination, social support, and policy support as critical factors associated with employment quality among PLWH. Thereafter, a questionnaire survey was conducted to gather information from 339 employed PLWH in China. Hierarchical regression analyses were further performed to analyze the effects of the identified factors on employment quality among PLWH. We obtained three main findings. First, negative self-image and workplace discrimination are detrimental to employment quality among PLWH; whereas social support and policy support are conducive to their employment quality. Second, older, male, and highly educated PLWH can better leverage the undesirable effects of negative self-image and workplace discrimination on employment quality compared with their peers. Third, male, and highly educated PLWH can better utilize social support and policy support to advance employment quality compared with their peers. However, the employment quality effects of the identified factors did not differ by marital status. Our findings provided some useful implications for PLWH, employers, community service providers, and policy makers to promote employment quality among PLWH."

https://openalex.org/W3108262789,"Introduction Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV infection remains a major public health problem and constitutes the most important cause of HIV infection in children. Knowledge of married women on MTCT of HIV is very important for successful intervention toward prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and achieving the goal of eliminating the new HIV infection. The objective of the study was to assess knowledge of married women on MTCT of HIV and associated factors in Mecha district Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A community based cross sectional study was conducted involving 520 married women from January 1 to February 30 /2017 in Mecha district. Interviewer administered questionnaires were used to collect the data. The collected data was entered, cleaned and checked using Epi Data version 3.1 and then analyzed with SPSS version 20. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was computed for all explanatory variables to identify determinant factors at 95% confidence interval. Explanatory variables having P-value &lt;0.05 taken as a predictor for knowledge of married women on mother to child transmission of HIV. Result This study was carried out among a total of 520 married reproductive age group women with a response rate of 98%. From the total of 510 respondents, 160(31.4%) of women were knowledgeable on vertical transmission of HIV (MTCT). Women who were knowledgeable on MTCT of HIV was positively associated with urban residence (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI: 1.05–2.92), women who had history of ANC follow up (AOR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.17–6.13), women who were pregnant during the study period (AOR = 1.86, 95%CI: 1.10–3.13) and those who had discussions with their husband about HIV/AIDS/ MTCT (AOR = 2.40, 95% CI: 1.52-.3.80). Conclusion and recommendation The finding from this study revealed that knowledge of married women on MTCT of HIV was low. This may contribute to increase the spread of MTCT of HIV. Therefore, giving more attention and emphasis on continuous education regarding MTCT of HIV is highly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3108440073,"Introduction Argus is an open source electronic solution to facilitate the reporting and management of public health surveillance data. Its components include an Android-phone application, used by healthcare facilities to report results via SMS; and a central server located at the Ministry of Health, displaying aggregated results on a web platform for intermediate and central levels. This study describes the results of the use of Argus in two regions of Togo. Methods Argus was used in 148 healthcare facilities from May 2016 to July 2018, expanding to 185 healthcare facilities from July 2018. Data from week 21 of 2016 to week 12 of 2019 was extracted from the Argus database and analysed. An assessment mission took place in August 2016 to collect users’ satisfaction, to estimate the concordance of the received data with the collected data, and to estimate the time required to report data with Argus. Results Overall completeness of data reporting was 76%, with 80% of reports from a given week being received before Tuesday 9PM. Concordance of data received from Argus and standard paper forms was 99.7%. Median time needed to send a report using Argus was 4 minutes. Overall completeness of data review at district, regional, and central levels were 89%, 68%, and 35% respectively. Implementation cost of Argus was 23 760 USD for 148 facilities. Conclusions The use of Argus in Togo enabled healthcare facilities to send weekly reports and alerts through SMS in a user-friendly, reliable and timely manner. Reengagement of surveillance officers at all levels, especially at the central level, enabled a dramatic increase in completeness and timeliness of data report and data review."
https://openalex.org/W3108505108,"Leymus chinensis (L . chinensis) is the dominant plant in the eastern margins of the Eurasian temperate grasslands. It is a very robust species, exhibiting good saline-alkali resistance and stabilizing soil. In this study, 67 soil samples and L . chinensis were collected in western Jilin province, China. The contents of N, P, K, S, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu and Na were measured, revealing that the growth of L . chinensis was mainly restricted by N based on the stoichiometric N: P ratios of plant. Furthermore, path analysis indicated that N was significantly correlated with K, S, Cu, and Zn. Imbalances in the homeostasis of these four elements may thus constrain N. The homeostasis index of Cu ( H Cu ) in sites with 100%-70% of vegetation cover was only 0.79, it was classified as a sensitive element. However, K, S and Zn, whose concentrations in L . chinensis were significantly related to those of N, exhibited no homeostatic characteristics. These results suggest that when seeking to treat saline-alkali stress, it is important to add fertilizers containing K, S, and Zn to avoid growth limitation. Na + , an ion associated with high soil alkalinity, exhibited weak homeostasis in L . chinensis even in sites with only 40%-10% of vegetation cover. When soil Na exceeded 16000 mg/kg, the homeostasis mechanism of L . chinensis appeared to be overwhelmed, resulting in rapid and probably harmful accumulation of Na. Proper control of N content can alleviate the toxicity of Na stress in L . chinensis and enhance its Na tolerance. Together, these results suggest that combined fertilization with N, K, S, Zn and Cu should be applied to improve grasslands growth. The results of this study can provide a reference basis for sustainable grassland management."
https://openalex.org/W3108514169,"β-hexosaminidase is an enzyme responsible for the degradation of gangliosides, glycans, and other glycoconjugates containing β-linked hexosamines that enter the lysosome. GM2 gangliosidoses, such as Tay-Sachs and Sandhoff, are lysosomal storage disorders characterized by β-hexosaminidase deficiency and subsequent lysosomal accumulation of its substrate metabolites. These two diseases result in neurodegeneration and early mortality in children. A significant difference between these two disorders is the accumulation in Sandhoff disease of soluble oligosaccharide metabolites that derive from N- and O-linked glycans. In this paper we describe our results from a longitudinal biochemical study of a feline model of Sandhoff disease and an ovine model of Tay-Sachs disease to investigate the accumulation of GM2/GA2 gangliosides, a secondary biomarker for phospholipidosis, bis-(monoacylglycero)-phosphate, and soluble glycan metabolites in both tissue and fluid samples from both animal models. While both Sandhoff cats and Tay-Sachs sheep accumulated significant amounts of GM2 and GA2 gangliosides compared to age-matched unaffected controls, the Sandhoff cats having the more severe disease, accumulated larger amounts of gangliosides compared to Tay-Sachs sheep in their occipital lobes. For monitoring glycan metabolites, we developed a quantitative LC/MS assay for one of these free glycans in order to perform longitudinal analysis. The Sandhoff cats showed significant disease-related increases in this glycan in brain and in other matrices including urine which may provide a useful clinical tool for measuring disease severity and therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we observed age-dependent increasing accumulation for a number of analytes, especially in Sandhoff cats where glycosphingolipid, phospholipid, and glycan levels showed incremental increases at later time points without signs of peaking. This large animal natural history study for Sandhoff and Tay-Sachs is the first of its kind, providing insight into disease progression at the biochemical level. This report may help in the development and testing of new therapies to treat these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3109709657,"The objective of this work is to provide a mathematical analysis on how a Thoroughbred horse should regulate its speed over the course of a race to optimize performance. Because Thoroughbred horses are not capable of running the whole race at top speed, determining what pace to set and when to unleash the burst of speed is essential. Our model relies on mechanics, energetics (both aerobic and anaerobic) and motor control. It is a system of coupled ordinary differential equations on the velocity, the propulsive force and the anaerobic energy, that leads to an optimal control problem that we solve. In order to identify the parameters meaningful for Thoroughbred horses, we use velocity data on races in Chantilly (France) provided by France Galop, the French governing body of flat horse racing in France. Our numerical simulations of performance optimization then provide the optimal speed along the race, the oxygen uptake evolution in a race, as well as the energy or the propulsive force. It also predicts how the horse has to change its effort and velocity according to the topography (altitude and bending) of the track."
https://openalex.org/W3107072144,"Obtaining neuron transcriptomes is challenging; their complex morphology and interconnected microenvironments make it difficult to isolate neurons without potentially altering gene expression. Multidendritic sensory neurons (md neurons) of Drosophila larvae are commonly used to study peripheral nervous system biology, particularly dendrite arborization. We sought to test if EC-tagging, a biosynthetic RNA tagging and purification method that avoids the caveats of physical isolation, would enable discovery of novel regulators of md neuron dendrite arborization. Our aims were twofold: discover novel md neuron transcripts and test the sensitivity of EC-tagging. RNAs were biosynthetically tagged by expressing CD:UPRT (a nucleobase-converting fusion enzyme) in md neurons and feeding 5-ethynylcytosine (EC) to larvae. Only CD:UPRT-expressing cells are competent to convert EC into 5-ethynyluridine-monophosphate which is subsequently incorporated into nascent RNA transcripts. Tagged RNAs were purified and used for RNA-sequencing. Reference RNA was prepared in a similar manner using 5-ethynyluridine (EUd) to tag RNA in all cells and negative control RNA-seq was performed on “mock tagged” samples to identify non-specifically purified transcripts. Differential expression analysis identified md neuron enriched and depleted transcripts. Three candidate genes encoding RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) were tested for a role in md neuron dendrite arborization. Loss-of-function for the m6A-binding factor Ythdc1 did not cause any dendrite arborization defects while RNAi of the other two candidates, the poly(A) polymerase Hiiragi and the translation regulator Hephaestus, caused significant defects in dendrite arborization. This work provides an expanded view of transcription in md neurons and a technical framework for combining EC-tagging with RNA-seq to profile transcription in cells that may not be amenable to physical isolation."
https://openalex.org/W3108758502,"Background Transmission of hepatitis C virus (HCV) among the prisoner population is most frequently associated with sharing of non-sterile injecting equipment. Other blood-to-blood contacts such as tattooing and physical violence are also common in the prison environment, and have been associated with HCV transmission. The context of such non-injecting risk behaviours, particularly violence, is poorly studied. The modified social-ecological model (MSEM) was used to examine HCV transmission risk and violence in the prison setting considering individual, network, community and policy factors. Methods The Australian Hepatitis C Incidence and Transmission Study in prisons (HITS-p) cohort enrolled HCV uninfected prisoners with injecting and non-injecting risk behaviours, who were followed up for HCV infection from 2004–2014. Qualitative interviews were conducted within 23 participants; of whom 13 had become HCV infected. Deductive analysis was undertaken to identify violence as risk within prisons among individual, network, community, and public policy levels. Results The risk context for violence and HCV exposure varied across the MSEM. At the individual level, participants were concerned about blood contact during fights, given limited scope to use gloves to prevent blood contamination. At the network level, drug debt and informing on others to correctional authorities, were risk factors for violence and potential HCV transmission. At the community level, racial influence, social groupings, and socially maligned crimes like sexual assault of children were identified as possible triggers for violence. At the policy level, rules and regulations by prison authority influenced the concerns and occurrence of violence and potential HCV transmission. Conclusion Contextual concerns regarding violence and HCV transmission were evident at each level of the MSEM. Further evidence-based interventions targeted across the MSEM may reduce prison violence, provide opportunities for HCV prevention when violence occurs and subsequent HCV exposure."
https://openalex.org/W3108456421,"Aim To determine the prevalence and causes of blindness, vision impairment and cataract surgery coverage among Rohingya refugees aged ≥ 50 years residing in camps in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh. Methods We used the Rapid Assessment of Avoidable Blindness (RAAB) methodology to select 76 clusters of 50 participants aged ≥ 50 years with probability proportionate to size. Demographic and cataract surgery data were collected using questionnaires, visual acuity was assessed per World Health Organization criteria and examinations were conducted by torch, and with direct ophthalmoscopy in eyes with pinhole-corrected vision &lt;6/12. RAAB software was used for data entry and analysis. Results We examined 3,629 of 3800 selected persons (95.5%). Age and sex adjusted prevalence of blindness (&lt;3/60), severe visual impairment (SVI; &gt;3/60 to ≤6/60), moderate visual impairment (MVI; &gt;6/60 to ≤6/18), and early visual impairment (EVI; &gt;6/18 to ≤6/12) were 2.14%, 2.35%, 9.68% and 14.7% respectively. Cataract was responsible for 75.0% of blindness and 75.8% of SVI, while refractive error caused 47.9% and 90.9% of MVI and EVI respectively. Most vision loss (95.9%) was avoidable. Cataract surgical coverage among the blind was 81.2%. Refractive error was detected in 17.1% (n = 622) of participants and 95.2% (n = 592) of these did not have spectacles. In the full Rohingya cohort of 76,692, approximately 10,000 surgeries are needed to correct all eyes impaired (&lt;6/18) by cataract, 12,000 need distance glasses and 73,000 require presbyopic correction. Conclusion The prevalence of blindness was lower than expected for a displaced population, in part due to few Rohingya being ≥60 years and the camp’s good access to cataract surgery. We suggest the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees include eye care among recommended health services for all refugees with long-term displacement."
https://openalex.org/W3108845143,"The human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) was developed to estimate the intensity of human activities in natural ecosystems, which is still unclear in the Xinjiang grasslands. Using the Biome-Biogeochemical Cycle (Biome-BGC) grazing model in combination with field data, we assessed the HANPP and explored its spatiotemporal patterns in the Xinjiang grasslands. Our results showed that (1) the HANPP increased from 38 g C/m 2 /yr in 1979 to 88 g C/m 2 /yr in 2012, with an average annual increase of 1.47%. The HANPP was 80 g C/m 2 /yr, which represented 51% of the potential net primary production (NPP pot ), and the HANPP efficiency was 70% in this region. (2) The areas with high HANPP values mainly occurred in northern Xinjiang and northwest of the Tianshan Mountains, while areas with low HANPP values mainly occurred in southern Xinjiang and southwest of the Tianshan Mountains. (3) Interannual variations in HANPP and NPP pot were significantly positively correlated (P&lt;0.01). Interannual variations in HANPP efficiency and grazing intensity were negatively correlated (P&lt;0.01). These results can help identify the complex impacts of human activities on grassland ecosystems and provide basic data for grassland management."
https://openalex.org/W3110260494,"The Neanderthal specimen from Lamalunga Cave, near Altamura (Apulia, Italy), was discovered during a speleological survey in 1993. The specimen is one of the most complete fossil hominins in Europe and its state of preservation is exceptional, although it is stuck in calcareous concretions and the bones are mostly covered by calcite depositions. Nevertheless, it is possible to carry out some observations on craniodental features that have not previously been described. In this work, we present an account of the oral cavity, made possible by the use of a videoscope, which allowed us to reach some hidden parts of the mandible and palate. This is the first detailed overview of the teeth and maxillary bones of the Neanderthal skeleton from Altamura. The dentition is almost complete. However, two teeth (upper right P3 and upper left M1) were lost ante mortem and four teeth (lower right I1 and P3 and lower left I1 and I2) were lost most probably post mortem . Dental wear is marked. The erupted M3s and the inversion of the compensating curve of Wilson in the M1s and M2s but not in the M3s suggest that the individual is fully adult, but not old. Although most of the teeth have their roots exposed for several millimeters, the periodontal bone appears to be in good condition overall, except in correspondence of the two ante-mortem tooth losses. X-rays of the anterior teeth show a periapical lesion, probably linked to the advanced dental wear. We also observed a weak expression of taurodontism in the posterior dentition and the presence of a retromolar space, features consistent with an attribution to the Neanderthal hypodigm; this attribution is also supported by aspects of the cranial morphology, the morphometric analysis of the scapula and preliminary mtDNA data. There is also a well-developed palatine torus, to the best of our knowledge a feature not previously described in Neanderthals."
https://openalex.org/W3110143212,"This study investigates the occurrence of erythematous lip lesions in a captive sun bear population in Cambodia, including the progression of cheilitis to squamous cell carcinoma, and the presence of Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1. Visual assessment conducted in 2015 and 2016 recorded the prevalence and severity of lesions. Opportunistic sampling for disease testing was conducted on a subset of 39 sun bears, with histopathological examination of lip and tongue biopsies and PCR testing of oral swabs and tissue biopsies collected during health examinations. Lip lesions were similarly prevalent in 2015 (66.0%) and 2016 (68.3%). Degradation of lip lesion severity was seen between 2015 and 2016, and the odds of having lip lesions, having more severe lip lesions, and having lip lesion degradation over time, all increased with age. Cheilitis was found in all lip lesion biopsies, with histological confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma in 64.5% of cases. Single biopsies frequently showed progression from dysplasia to neoplasia. Eighteen of 31 sun bears (58.1%) had at least one sample positive for Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1. The virus was detected in sun bears with and without lip lesions, however due to case selection being strongly biased towards those showing lip lesions it was not possible to test for association between Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 and lip squamous cell carcinoma. Given gammaherpesviruses can play a role in cancer development under certain conditions in other species, we believe further investigation into Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 as one of a number of possible co-factors in the progression of lip lesions to squamous cell carcinoma is warranted. This study highlights the progressively neoplastic nature of this lip lesion syndrome in sun bears which has consequences for captive and re-release management. Similarly, the detection of Ursid gammaherpesvirus 1 should be considered in pre-release risk analyses, at least until data is available on the prevalence of the virus in wild sun bears."
