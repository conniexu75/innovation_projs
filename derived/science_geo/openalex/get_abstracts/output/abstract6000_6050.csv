https://openalex.org/W2041963065,"When double helical DNA is exposed to conditions favoring partial melting in polyacrylamide gels, its electrophoretic mobility undergoes a sharp cooperative transition, resulting in a large reduction in mobility. In the present experiments, where the transition is effected at a uniform temperature of 60 degrees C in a concentration gradient of a urea-formamide mixture, each Eco RI fragment of lambda or E. coli DNA exhibits the mobility transition at a characteristic concentration of the denaturant. The sudden retardation of fragments moving toward higher denaturant concentration in the gradient results in a pattern of sharpened zones in order depending upon nucleotide sequence, rather than size, and only very slightly dependent upon the time after the last fragment has been retarded. When combined with length-dependent electrophoresis in agarose in the perpendicular direction, this system provides a two-dimensional separation of fragments. The resolving power of the system is demonstrated by the clear resolution of over 250 fragments of the Eco RI digest of E. coli DNA. Corresponding fragments from an isogenic lambda lysogen of E. coli are found in the same positions, and additional fragments unique to the lysogen are evident."

https://openalex.org/W1589224106,"The recognition sequence for the dam methylase of Escherichia coli K12 has been determined directly by use of in vivo methylated ColE1 DNA or DNA methylated in vitro with purified enzyme. The methylase recognizes the symmetric tetranucleotide d(pG-A-T-C) and introduces two methyl groups per site in duplex DNA with the product of methylation being 6-methylaminopurine. This work has also demonstrated that Dpn I restriction endonuclease cleaves on the 3' side of the modified adenine within the methylated sequence to yield DNA fragments possessing fully base-paired termini. All sequences in ColE1 DNA methylated by the dam enzyme are subject to double strand cleavage by Dpn I endonuclease. Therefore, this restriction enzyme can be employed for mapping the location of sequences possessing the dam modification."
https://openalex.org/W1506571128,"Peptides with opioid activity are found in pepsin hydrolysates of wheat gluten and alpha-casein. The opioid activity of these peptides was demonstrated by use of the following bioassays: 1) naloxone-reversible inhibition of adenylate cyclase in homogenates of neuroblastoma X-glioma hybrid cells; 2) naloxone-reversible inhibition of electrically stimulated contractions of the mouse vas deferens; 3) displacement of [3H]dihydromorphine and [3H-Tyr, dAla2]met-enkephalin amide from rat brain membranes. Substances which stimulate adenylate cyclase and increase the contractions of the mouse vas deferens but do not bind to opiate receptors are also isolated from gluten hydrolysates. It is suggested that peptides derived from some food proteins may be of physiological importance."
https://openalex.org/W1987586745,"The antitumor drug cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum(II) (cis-DDP) and the inactive trans isomer bind and produce cooperative changes in closed and nicked circular duplex DNA's. Covalent binding of both platinum complexes to the closed circular DNA alters the degree of supercoiling, presumably by disrupting and unwinding the double helix. Electron micrographs show the platinated DNA's to be shortened by up to 50 percent of their original length. At similar ratios of bound platinum per nucleotide, the electrophoretic mobilities of the DNA's in gels containing the dye ethidium bromide are the same for both isomers. The only detectable difference in the binding of the two platinum isomers is an increase in the electrophoretic mobility in nondye gels of closed circular DNA having small amounts of bound cis-DDP that is not apparent for the trans complex."
https://openalex.org/W1594891180,"A study of the enzymes of the arachidonic acid cascade revealed a high sensitivity of prostacyclin synthetase and a complete resistance of thromboxane A2 synthetase to time-dependent destruction by an oxidant [Ox] released during the peroxidase-catalyzed reduction of hydroperoxy fatty acids. The destructive action of [Ox] derived from prostaglandin G1 (PGG1), 15-hydroperoxy-PGE1, 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid, and 12-hydroperoxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid upon prostacyclin synthetase was prevented by 2-aminomethyl-4-t-butyl-6-iodophenol. On the other hand, deactivation resulting from PGG2 metabolism was neither time-dependent nor sensitive to 2-aminomethyl-4-t-butyl-6-iodophenol. The possibility that the action of [Ox] may alter the arachidonic acid cascade in favor of thromboxane A2 is discussed in view of its possible implications in inflammatory and other pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1575133253,"DNA polymerase III, the core of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, has been purified 28,000-fold to 97% homogeneity from Escherichia coli HMS-83. The enzyme contains subunits: alpha, epsilon, and theta of 140,000, 25,000, and 10,000 daltons, respectively. The alpha subunit has been previously shown to be a component of both DNA polymerase III and the more complex DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (Livingston, D.M., Hinkle, D., and Richardson, C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 461-469; McHenry, C., and Kornberg, A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6478-6484). It is demonstrated here that the epsilon and theta subunits are also subunits of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Thus, the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme contains at least six different subunits. Our preparation has both the 3' leads to 5' and 5' leads to 3' exonuclease activities previously assigned to DNA polymerase III (Livingston, D., and Richardson, C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 470-478)."

https://openalex.org/W1984911200,"By means of double fluorescence staining experiments, intracellular alpha-actinin was found to accumulate under caps and patches induced in several cells by a variety of ligands. This phenomenon was demonstrated in lymphocytes and lymphoma cells treated with anti-H-2 sera; spleen lymphocytes treated with concanavalin A or anti-immunoglobulin antibodies, and VSV-infected mouse fibroblast line MC57 treated with antiserum against viral antigens. It occurred during both rapid and slow capping processes, and could be obtained by either direct or indirect ligand-induced redistribution. These observations were carried out on whole cells. For other cytoskeletal proteins such as filamin, tropomyosin and myosin, a similar accumulation under caps was not readily apparent using whole cell mounts, although earlier experiments with frozen-sectioned cells had shown such an enrichment of myosin (as well as actin). The enrichment of alpha-actinin under the clustered surface molecules was already apparent in early stages (patching) of the capping process, with or without 10 mM sodium azide present. Prolonged incubation of the cells with the different ligands resulted in endocytosis of the ligand-receptor complex. alpha-Actinin was not associated with the inernalized complex, however, suggesting that it may dissociate from the patched or capped surface structures at some stage during endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1604979224,"Oligomers of a protein, porin, form permeability channels in the outer membrane of Escherichia coli B. A functional porin oligomer was identified and was purified to homogeneity by gel filtration in the presence of salts and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Molecular weights of purified porin oligomer and heat-dissociated monomer appeared to be 102,900 and 32,600, respectively, when determined by sedimentation equilibrium in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. We concluded that the porin oligomer thus consists of three identical subunits. These data and results from other laboratories suggest porin trimers exist also in the outer membrane of intact cells, and participate in the formation of permeability channels. It was found that porin trimer bound less sodium dodecyl sulfate than the porin monomer."

https://openalex.org/W1974034009,"Antibodies specific to protein HMG-1 were purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose columns to which HMG-1 was covalently bound. Immunofluorescence studies with these antibodies reveal that HMG-1 or components which immunologically cross-react with HMG-1 are present in the cytoplasm of Chinese hamster V-79, rat liver TR-12 and bovine trachea EBTr-NBL-4 cells. At selected antibody concentrations, the fluorescence present in the cytoplasm is more intense than that observed in the nucleus. The presence of HMG-1 protein in the cytoplasm of rat liver cells was verified by direct examination of the protein content of selected cytoplasmic fractions. A protein with electrophoretic mobility identical to HMG-1 was detected by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing either sodium dodecylsulfate or urea. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic extracts yielded a positive complement fixation with anti-HMG-1, while no reaction was obtained with control anti-H1 sera. We suggest that HMG proteins, rather than functioning in the nucleus alone, are important structural elements of the entire cell."

https://openalex.org/W2030009298,"Abstract We have demonstrated that induction of synthesis of the mRNAs encoding the galactose-catabolizing enzymes galactokinase (E.C.2.7.1.6) and transferase (E.C.2.7.7.12) occurs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae following the addition of α-D-galactose during continuous exposure to 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide. The prompt induction and sustained accumulation of galactose message activity (detected in the wheat germ in vitro translation system) following the cessation of all detectable protein synthesis in vivo indicate that the GAL4 regulatory protein and any as yet undefined positive effectors of transcription of the galactose genes exist prior to induction and are therefore synthesized constitutively. We have carried out synchronous matings in which inducible gal1 cells lacking galactokinase function were mated with uninducible gal4 cells containing either the normal GAL80 -encoded galactose-sensitive repressor or a dominant GAL80 S -encoded galactose-insensitive repressor. All cells were cultured in the continuous presence of galactose to allow for the possibility of inducible synthesis of the GAL4 -specified protein. Galactokinase was expressed in the GAL80/GAL80 zygote (the control experiment) and not in the GAL80 S / GAL80 zygote, indicating that a galactose-insensitive repressor can neutralize already existing GAL4 protein activity. These results, particularly the cycloheximide finding, necessitate a revision of a central element of the Douglas and Hawthorne (1966) model for galactose regulation, in which it was postulated that the GAL80 gene product acts at a GAL4 operator to repress GAL4 transcription. Our observations indicate that the repressor must control GAL4 regulatory activity at a post-translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1591624773,"The structure of cytochrome b562 from Escherichia coli has been determined at 2.5 A resolution by x-ray diffraction methods. Protein phases were computed by the single isomorphous replacement method with anomalous scattering measurements from the native and uranyl acetate-substituted crystals. The electron density was averaged about the noncrystallographic 2-fold axis relating 2 molecules in the triclinic unit cell. The protein consists of four nearly parallel alpha helices and represents a new class of cytochrome structure. The heme group is inserted between the helices near one end of the molecule with one heme face partially exposed to solvent. The two heme ligands are histidine and methionine. The 2 phenylalanines are packed internally near the heme group, and the 2 tyrosines are on the surface, also near the heme group. The folding of the protein resembles that of hemerythrin and tobacco mosaic virus protein and shows a different topology from that of cytochrome b5, cytochrome c, or the globins."

https://openalex.org/W2060012575,"Nucleotide sequences were analyzed across the two ends of lysogenic Mu DNA. These ends were cloned separately in lambdapMu hybrid particles that derived from a single Mu lysogen in the lac Z part of lambdaplac5. The obtained data imply that Mu lysogenization was associated with the duplication of 5 base pairs present in lac DNA at the Mu insertion site. As a result of this duplication, Mu DNA is flanked by two copies of five identical base pairs oriented as direct repeats. A similar conclusion has been obtained independently by other investigators with the use of a different Mu lysogen (D. Kamp and R. Kahmann, personal communication). Thus Mu insertion seems to have a striking similarity to typical IS-mediated insertions that were found to be associated with a short DNA duplication at the target site."

https://openalex.org/W2018808119,"The functional structure of the promoter region of a bacterial ribosomal operon is analyzed by in vitro transcription of linear DNA fragments derived from the hybrid Col EI plasmid pGG1. This plasmid contains the promoter region of the rrn B ribosomal cistron present in the lambdarifd18. When transcripts arising from this promoter region are terminated by restriction endonuclease cleavage of DNA, two RNA chains are resolved by gel electrophoresis that differ in length by about 100 bases. Evidence is presented indicating that these two transcripts arise from different initiation sites, each directing tandem transcription on the sense strand of the early portion of the ribosomal cistron."
https://openalex.org/W1537955742,"In this communication, we describe a simple procedure for analyzing the processiveness of DNA polymerases in general. By choosing conditions for which the number of incorporations per available primer is less than 1, we have reduced the probability of a primer molecule being utilized by the enzyme more than once. The primer-template used was poly(dA)300:oligo(dT)10, and the product was isolated by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. The number of dTMP residues added per association was determined from the [3H]dThd + [3'-3H]dTMP/[3H]dThd ratio of the product after its digestion by micrococcal nuclease and spleen phosphodiesterase. Using this procedure, we have found that Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I, T4 DNA polymerase, and calf thymus alpha- and beta-DNA polymerase are quasi-processive. Most of these enzymes add on the average approximately 10 to 15 nucleotides before dissociating from the template. T5 DNA polymerase, on the other hand, is processive, i.e. it continues to replicate a given template until it is very close to the 5' end of the template. With nicked DNA-like poly(dA):oligo(dT), the processiveness of E. coli DNA polymerase I is increased 2- to 2.5-fold. The significance of this increase in determining the patch size during DNA repair is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1602774880,"A large polypeptide having a molecular weight of 240,000 as determined by electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate has been identified in whole cell homogenates from chick skeletal muscle myoblasts and the rat myoblast L6 cell line. A similar polypeptide was identified in both thigh and breast chicken skeletal muscle, but the latter contained less of this protein per g of tissue. Antibodies made to gizzard filamin (an actin-binding protein having a molecular weight of 240,000) cross-reacted with the partially purified Mr = 240,000 protein from chicken skeletal muscle. With use of the indirect immunofluorescence technique, the filamin antibody localized in the Z-line region of chicken skeletal muscle myofibrils. These results indicate that skeletal muscle contains a filamin-like protein that may form an integral part of the myofibril structure."
https://openalex.org/W1495086711,Chemotactically wild type Escherichia coli were incubated with L-[methyl-3H]methionine to label the methyl groups of their methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins. Cells were then treated to specifically demethylate these proteins. We have identified the end product of this demethylation as [3H]methanol in the cell-free medium from treated cells.
https://openalex.org/W1499727494,"Abstract The rates of cleavage of DNAs containing substituents at position 5 of thymine or cytosine have been measured for a variety of sequence-specific endonucleases, so as to determine which features in the DNA sequence are being probed. Phage phi e DNA fully substituted with 5-hydroxymethyluracil is cleaved more slowly by enzymes whose recognition sequences contain A-T base pairs than are DNAs containing thymine, but both types of DNA are cleaved at similar rates by enzymes recognizing sequences composed only of G-C base pairs. Phage PBS2 DNA with uracil completely substituted for thymine is cleaved slowly by several enzymes which recognize sequences containing A-T base pairs (endonucleases Hpa I, HindII, and HindIII), while the rates of cleavage by other enzymes (endonucleases EcoRI and BamHI) are not affected. Phage lambda- and P22 DNAs containing 5-bromouracil are cleaved more slowly by several enzymes (endonucleases HindIII, Hpa I, BamHI) than are thymine-containing DNAs. Enzymes that recognize sequence isomers with the composition G:C:2A:2T (endonucleases EcoRI, Hpa I, HindIII) are not equally affected by substitution at position 5 of thymine, suggesting that they differ in their contacts with A-T base pairs. DNA containing glucosylated 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in place of cytosine is resistant to cleavage by all the endonucleases examined."
https://openalex.org/W1484445362,"Abstract A novel nucleotide has been detected in Escherichia coli subjected to the stringent response. However, this nucleotide does not accumulate in relA+ cells subjected to heat shock, in which guanosine 5'-diphosphate-3'-diphosphate does accumulate but stable RNA synthesis is not restricted. The intracellular level of this new nucleotide thus correlates well with control of stable RNA synthesis. Chemical and enzymatic analysis shows that the new nucleotide is guanosine 5'-diphosphate-3'-monophosphate. It is suggested that this nucleotide may play a role in stringent control of stable RNA synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1515948718,"Abstract When a mating type cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are exposed to the mating pheromone alpha-factor in liquid cultures, there is a time-dependent loss of alpha-factor activity from the culture fluid. This loss of biological activity can be directly correlated with the proteolysis of the pheromone by a mating type cells. The metabolism of alpha-factor by a mating type cells may be measured by using either in vitro 125I-labeled or in vivo 35S-labeled pheromone. Addition of chloroquine to growing cultures of a mating type cells at concentrations which cause no detectable alterations in cell growth produces a potentiation of alpha-factor mediated cell cycle arrest. This potentiation of alpha-factor activity is directly correlated with the inhibition of alpha-factor proteolysis. Thus, while proteolytic digestion of alpha-factor appears to be related to the mechanism whereby a mating type cells detoxify alpha-factor and recover from cell cycle arrest, proteolysis of the mating factor is not necessary for alpha-factor mediated cell cycle arrest."

https://openalex.org/W1485576184,"A method of identifying plasmids containing genes responsible for synthesis of nucleotide sugar:lipopolysaccharide glycosyltransferases is described. Hybrid ColE1 plasmids containing random fragments of the chromosome of Escherichia coli K12 were introduced into an indicator strain of Salmonella typhimurium which lacks UDP-glucose:lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase I due to an rfaG mutation. Plasmids capable of correcting the transferase defect were identified by their ability to convert the bacteriophage sensitivity pattern of the recipient strain from Ffm-sensitive to Ffm-resistant. Analysis of the lipopolysaccharide of the S. typhimurium/ColE1 hybrid strains and assay of cell extracts defined the new enzyme activities. Two plasmids were identified which carried the rfaG+ gene; one of these plasmids also contained genetic information for a second glucosyltransferase, the E. coli glucosyltransferase II, which normally is not present in S. typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W1544898320,"A strain of Escherichia coli bearing a hybrid plasmid containing the psd gene, starved for isoleucine by the addition of valine, produces amounts of phosphatidyl-serine decarboxylase, a membrane-bound enzyme, about 40-fold higher than wild type. At least 98% of the enzyme from cells with high levels of decarboxylase is isolated in the inner, cytoplasmic membrane fraction if the cells are broken by osmotic lysis of spheroplasts following treatment with lysozyme/EDTA. In contrast, if cells containing these large amounts of enzyme are disrupted by sonication, 40 to 45% of the activity is recovered in the 100,000 times g supernatant fraction, whereas with wild type cells, only 5 to 10% is recovered in this fraction. About half of the decarboxylase in membranes saturated with the enzyme is thus only loosely bound, and readily removed by sonication, but not by osmotic lysis. This apparent saturation of the membrane with decarboxylase seems specific, since two other membrane-bound enzymes, phosphatidyl-glycerophosphate synthetase, and CDP-diglyceride synthetase, are not displaced into the supernatant fraction upon sonication. Fractionation on columns of agarose and by centrifugation through gradients of sucrose revealed that the decarboxylase in the supernatant is associated with lipid, in a complex with an apparent molecular weight of at least 5 times 10(6)."
https://openalex.org/W1529882430,"When treated at pH less than 4.5, yeast nuclei or chromatin lose endogenous RNA synthetic activity. This activity is regained by addition of exogenous RNA polymerases. The specificity of transcription in this system by homologous RNA polymerases I and III has been investigated by gel electrophoresis, hybridization analysis, and RNase T1 mapping. Exogenous RNA polymerase I selectively transcribes rRNA genes. The transcription of these genes by polymerase I is 30- and 8-fold more selective than RNA polymerase III and Escherichia coli polymerase holoenzyme, respectively. Exogenous RNA polymerase III synthesized RNAs similar in size to authentic 5 S RNA, 4.5 S pre-tRNA, and 4 S tRNA. Eleven per cent of this RNA is 5 S RNA as determined by hybridization. Neither polymerase I nor E. coli polymerase synthesizes detectable quantities of RNA in this size range. AT1 ribonuclease digestion of 5 S RNA synthesized by exogenous RNA polymerase III acting on acid-treated chromatin gives a fragment pattern corresponding to that of 5 S RNA. Thus, RNA polymerase III transcribes the entire 5 S gene in this system."

https://openalex.org/W1490917809,"Abstract The structure of the prosthetic group of citrate lyase (Klebsiella aerogenes) was studied by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The spectra at 360 MHz of the nucleoside moiety (2'-ribosyladenosine) show the absence of 2'-hydroxyl proton, thus confirming the 2' position as the site of attachment of the second ribose moiety to the dephospho-CoA. This glycosidic linkage is found to be alpha(1 leads to 2') and is identical to that of poly(ADP-ribose). Studies of permethylation products by mass spectrometry support the above conclusion regarding the location of the ribosidic linkage."

Initial rate kinetic studies demonstrate the ppGpp inhibition is competitive with respect to GTP and noncompetitive with respect to L-aspartate and IMP. This is in contrast to an earlier report (Gallant, J., Irr, J., and Cashel, M. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 5812-5816), which suggested that ppGpp did not bind at the GTP site. Possible reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. The potency of the ppGpp inhibition is confirmed."

Expression of the gene for this enzyme was also demonstrated in several strains of E. coli by direct assay. The E. coli and S. typhimurium enzymes are similar in catalytic properties and immunologic specificity. The finding of the galactosyltransferase activity in E. coli extracts is surprising since the alpha1,3-galactosylglucose disaccharide which is the product of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction does not appear to be present in the E. coli lipopolysaccharide."

This measured value is comparable to the radius of gyration of 31.5 angstrom calculated from the refined coordinates of the dimer in the BII crystal form. The hexokinase dimer found in the BI crystal form has a radius of gyration of 42 angstrom calculated from the atomic coordinates. Thus, the measured radius of gyration is consistent with the BII dimer being the predominant species in solution and rules out the existence of the BI dimer as a major species under these conditions."

The concentration dependence of this inhibition was not cooperative. Enzyme activity was inhibited 50% at 1 microM palmitoyl-CoA; thus, this inhibition occurred at concentrations below the critical micellar concentration of palmitoyl-CoA. Palmitoyl-CoA was a reversible, noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to both NADPH and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Palmitoyl-CoA did not affect the quaternary structure of the enzyme. This inhibition could be prevented or reversed by the addition of phospholipid vesicles prepared from E. coli phospholipids. Palmitoyl-CoA did not alter the kinetics of inhibition by sn-glycerol 3-phosphate, which is a proven physiological regulator of this enzyme. Decanoyl-CoA, dodecanoyl-CoA, myristoyl-CoA, palmitoyl-(1,N6-etheno)CoA, stearoyl-CoA, and oleoyl-CoA inhibited sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase at concentrations below their critical micellar concentrations. Palmitate inhibited sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity 50% at 200 microM. Palmitoyl-carnitine, deoxycholate, taurocholate, and dodecyl sulfate were more potent inhibitors than Triton X-100, Tween-20, or Tween-80. Palmitoyl-acyl carrier protein at concentrations up to 50 microM had no effect on sn-glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity.

https://openalex.org/W1555934782,"The transport of phenylalanine by the general aromatic transport system in spheroplasts of Escherichia coli 9723 has been found to be stimulated by exogenous tRNA. Neither periodate-treated tRNA nor phenylalanine-charged tRNA stimulated, and the latter inhibited, phenylalanine uptake. Among preparations of specific tRNAs, tRNAPhe and tRNATyr were effective in stimulating the uptake of phenylalanine and tyrosine, respectively, and tRNAGlu and tRNAVal gave no detectable stimulation of phenylalanine or tyrosine transport. The preparation of tRNATyr was 10 times as active as unfractionated tRNA and gave as much as 167% stimulation of tyrosine transport. Correspondingly, the preparation of tRNAPhe was at least 3.5 times as active as the unfractionated tRNA and 2.5 times as active as the preparation of tRNATyr in stimulation of phenylalanine transport. Preliminary results in fractionation of the active component of tRNA for stimulating phenylalanine uptake show that the major activity resides in minor isoacceptor(s) tRNAPhe rather than the major component tRNAPhe, and the slight activity of preparations of tRNATyr is probably due to a contamination of the active tRNAPhe. Other preliminary results indicate that this type of stimulation occurs with uptake of other amino acids and their tRNA."
