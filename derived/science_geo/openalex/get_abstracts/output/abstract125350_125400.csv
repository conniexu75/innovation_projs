https://openalex.org/W2157212789,"Multiple endocrine neoplasia-type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome characterized by tumors in parathyroids, enteropancreatic endocrine tissues, and the anterior pituitary. DNA sequencing from a previously identified minimal interval on chromosome 11q13 identified several candidate genes, one of which contained 12 different frameshift, nonsense, missense, and in-frame deletion mutations in 14 probands from 15 families. The MEN1 gene contains 10 exons and encodes a ubiquitously expressed 2.8-kilobase transcript. The predicted 610-amino acid protein product, termed menin, exhibits no apparent similarities to any previously known proteins. The identification of MEN1 will enable improved understanding of the mechanism of endocrine tumorigenesis and should facilitate early diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2082259697,"We have identified and purified from HeLa cytosol a protein that induces DNA fragmentation in coincubated nuclei after it is activated by caspase-3. This protein, designated DNA Fragmentation Factor (DFF), is a heterodimer of 40 kDa and 45 kDa subunits. The amino acid sequence of the 45 kDa subunit, determined from its cDNA sequence, reveals it to be a novel protein. Caspase-3 cleaves the 45 kDa subunit at two sites to generate an active factor that produces DNA fragmentation without further requirement for caspase-3 or other cytosolic proteins. In cells undergoing apoptosis, the 45 kDa subunit is cleaved in the same pattern as it is cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro. These data delineate a direct signal transduction pathway during apoptosis: caspase-3 to DFF to DNA fragmentation."
https://openalex.org/W4237410627,"The envelope glycoprotein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) consists of a complex of gp120 and gp41. gp120 determines viral tropism by binding to target-cell receptors, while gp41 mediates fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Previous studies identified an alpha-helical domain within gp41 composed of a trimer of two interacting peptides. The crystal structure of this complex, composed of the peptides N36 and C34, is a six-helical bundle. Three N36 helices form an interior, parallel coiled-coil trimer, while three C34 helices pack in an oblique, antiparallel manner into highly conserved, hydrophobic grooves on the surface of this trimer. This structure shows striking similarity to the low-pH-induced conformation of influenza hemagglutinin and likely represents the core of fusion-active gp41. Avenues for the design/discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of HIV infection are directly suggested by this structure."
https://openalex.org/W2139306838,"The Hsp90 chaperone is required for the activation of several families of eukaryotic protein kinases and nuclear hormone receptors, many of which are proto-oncogenic and play a prominent role in cancer. The geldanamycin antibiotic has antiproliferative and antitumor effects, as it binds to Hsp90, inhibits the Hsp90-mediated conformational maturation/refolding reaction, and results in the degradation of Hsp90 substrates. The structure of the geldanamycin-binding domain of Hsp90 (residues 9–232) reveals a pronounced pocket, 15 Å deep, that is highly conserved across species. Geldanamycin binds inside this pocket, adopting a compact structure similar to that of a polypeptide chain in a turn conformation. This, and the pocket's similarity to substrate-binding sites, suggest that the pocket binds a portion of the polypeptide substrate and participates in the conformational maturation/ refolding reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2091355622,Miniaturized triblock copolymers have been found to self-assemble into nanostructures that are highly regular in size and shape. Mushroom-shaped supramolecular structures of about 200 kilodaltons form by crystallization of the chemically identical blocks and self-organize into films containing 100 or more layers stacked in a polar arrangement. The polar supramolecular material exhibits spontaneous second-harmonic generation from infrared to green photons and has an adhesive tape–like character with nonadhesive-hydrophobic and hydrophilic-sticky opposite surfaces. The films also have reasonable shear strength and adhere tenaciously to glass surfaces on one side only. The regular and finite size of the supramolecular units is believed to be mediated by repulsive forces among some of the segments in the triblock molecules. A large diversity of multifunctional materials could be formed from regular supramolecular units weighing hundreds of kilodaltons.
https://openalex.org/W2010397121,"Growth of thin films from atoms deposited from the gas phase is intrinsically a nonequilibrium phenomenon governed by a competition between kinetics and thermodynamics. Precise control of the growth and thus of the properties of deposited films becomes possible only after an understanding of this competition is achieved. Here, the atomic nature of the most important kinetic mechanisms of film growth is explored. These mechanisms include adatom diffusion on terraces, along steps, and around island corners; nucleation and dynamics of the stable nucleus; atom attachment to and detachment from terraces and islands; and interlayer mass transport. Ways to manipulate the growth kinetics in order to select a desired growth mode are briefly addressed."
https://openalex.org/W2071242185,"RGS proteins are GTPase activators for heterotrimeric G proteins. We report here the 2.8 Å resolution crystal structure of the RGS protein RGS4 complexed with Giα1–Mg2+–GDP–AlF4−. Only the core domain of RGS4 is visible in the crystal. The core domain binds to the three switch regions of Giα1, but does not contribute catalytic residues that directly interact with either GDP or AlF4−. Therefore, RGS4 appears to catalyze rapid hydrolysis of GTP primarily by stabilizing the switch regions of Giα1, although the conserved Asn-128 from RGS4 could also play a catalytic role by interacting with the hydrolytic water molecule or the side chain of Gln-204. The binding site for RGS4 on Giα1 is also consistent with the activity of RGS proteins as antagonists of Gα effectors."
https://openalex.org/W1993249060,"We have identified and characterized an elaborate genetic system in the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi that promotes extensive antigenic variation of a surface-exposed lipoprotein, VlsE. A 28 kb linear plasmid of B. burgdorferi B31 (lp28-1) was found to contain a vmp-like sequence (vls) locus that closely resembles the variable major protein (vmp) system for antigenic variation of relapsing fever organisms. Portions of several of the 15 nonexpressed (silent) vls cassette sequences located upstream of vlsE recombined into the central vlsE cassette region during infection of C3H/HeN mice, resulting in antigenic variation of the expressed lipoprotein. This combinatorial variation could potentially produce millions of antigenic variants in the mammalian host."
https://openalex.org/W2008674263,"The kinetics of a first-order, solid-solid phase transition were investigated in the prototypical nanocrystal system CdSe as a function of crystallite size. In contrast to extended solids, nanocrystals convert from one structure to another by single nucleation events, and the transformations obey simple unimolecular kinetics. Barrier heights were observed to increase with increasing nanocrystal size, although they also depend on the nature of the nanocrystal surface. These results are analogous to magnetic phase transitions in nanocrystals and suggest general rules that may be of use in the discovery of new metastable phases."
https://openalex.org/W2107334607,"The crystal structure of the adenine nucleotide exchange factor GrpE in complex with the adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) domain of Escherichia coli DnaK [heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70)] was determined at 2.8 angstrom resolution. A dimer of GrpE binds asymmetrically to a single molecule of DnaK. The structure of the nucleotide-free ATPase domain in complex with GrpE resembles closely that of the nucleotide-bound mammalian Hsp70 homolog, except for an outward rotation of one of the subdomains of the protein. This conformational change is not consistent with tight nucleotide binding. Two long α helices extend away from the GrpE dimer and suggest a role for GrpE in peptide release from DnaK."
https://openalex.org/W2135778926,"Adipocyte differentiation is regulated both positively and negatively by external growth factors such as insulin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF). A key component of the adipocyte differentiation process is PPARγ, peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ. To determine the relationship between PPARγ activation and growth factor stimulation in adipogenesis, we investigated the effects of PDGF and EGF on PPARγ1 activity. PDGF treatment decreased ligand-activated PPARγ1 transcriptional activity in a transient reporter assay.In vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling experiments demonstrated that PPARγ1 is a phosphoprotein that undergoes EGF-stimulated MEK/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase-dependent phosphorylation. Purified PPARγ1 protein was phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant activated MAP kinase. Examination of the PPARγ1 sequence revealed a single MAP kinase consensus recognition site at Ser82. Mutation of Ser82 to Ala inhibited both in vitro andin vivo phosphorylation and growth factor-mediated transcriptional repression.

Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (6341) Google Scholar). These receptors heterodimerize with retinoic acid-like receptor, RXR, and become transcriptionally active when bound to ligand. The three PPAR isoforms (α, δ, and γ) differ in their C-terminal ligand binding domains, and each appears to bind and respond to a specific subset of agents including hypolipidemic drugs, long chain fatty acids, aracadonic acid metabolites, and antidiabetic thiazolidinediones (2Issemann I.

Ectopic expression of either PPARα or PPARγ in NIH-3T3 cells is sufficient to induce adipocyte differentiation in the presence of PPARγ activators (9Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.

The rapid induction of PPARγ during adipocyte differentiation and its enriched expression in adipose tissues suggest that PPARγ is responsible for the initiation and maintenance of the adipocyte phenotype in vivo (9Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3132) Google Scholar). Previously two isotypes of PPARγ (PPARγ1 and PPARγ2) have been identified in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (11Tontonoz P. Graves R. Budavari A. Erdjument-Bromage M. Hu E. Tempst P. Spiegelman B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5623-5634Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Zhu et al. (12Zhu Y. Qi C. Korenberg J. Chen X. Noya D. Rao S. Reddy J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that these two isotypes are derived from a single PPARγ gene by alternative promoter usage and RNA splicing. However, thus far, no functional difference has been found between the two isotypes. Adipogenesis is a complex process; multiple hormones and factors regulate the conversion of progenitor cells to adipocytes. Insulin and/or insulin-like growth factor enhance the ability of PPAR ligand to induce differentiation of both 3T3-L1- and PPARγ-overexpressing cell lines (9Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.

In contrast, growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor inhibit adipocyte conversion (14Serrero G. Biochem. Biophys.

In this report, we find that activation of EGF and PDGF receptors and subsequent phosphorylation of PPARγ1 by the MAP kinase signaling pathway decreases PPARγ1 transcriptional activity. This repression is mediated by MAP kinase phosphorylation of Ser82 on PPARγ1. These studies identify PPARγ1 as a substrate of MAP kinase and provide evidence for regulation of PPARγ1 activity by phosphorylation. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The ECL detection system and carrier-free [32P]orthophosphate were obtained from Amersham Corp. The PDGF was purchased from Intergen, while EGF was from Harlan. PD98059 and BRL49653 were synthesized at Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division of Warner-Lambert Co. For eukaryotic expression of PPARγ1 and RXRα, the entire PPARγ1 or RXRα cDNA was inserted 3′ to the cytomegalovirus promoter in pSG5 (Stratagene). Constitutively active MAP kinase kinase (CA-MEK), which contains mutations at Ser218 to Glu and Ser222to Glu was obtained from Dr. S. Decker (Parke-Davis). Site-directed mutagenesis of PPARγ1/pSG5 was conducted using the MORPH site-specific plasmid DNA mutagenesis system (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO). The oligonucleotide used in mutagenesis was CAAAGTAGAACCTGCAGCTCCACCTTATTATTCTGAAAAGACCC and changed Ser82 to Ala. The reporter construct used in the transfections contained three copies of the PPRE site from the aP2 enhancer (ARE7) inserted upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase (TK) promoter in the pGL3 basic luciferase vector (a gift from Dr. R. Wyborski). All constructs were sequenced prior to use. For the transient transfection, NIH 3T3 cells were grown in 10% fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and co-transfected with various expression plasmids and pCMV β-galactosidase plasmid (Clontech) using Lipofectamine (Life Technologies, Inc.). After recovery, cells were placed in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 5 h and then treated with 25 μm BRL49653 and/or 100 ng/ml PDGF for 16 h. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined using a Luciferase assay (Promega) and the Galacto-light system (Tropix, Inc.). To express the maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, the coding regions of PPARγ1, PPARδ, and RXRα were inserted downstream of the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible MalE-lacZα gene fusion in the pMAL-C2 plasmid (New England Biolabs). Protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the fusion proteins were partially purified by amylose affinity chromatography (19Maina C.V. Riggs P.D. Grandea A.G. Slatko B.E. Moran L.S. Tagliamonte J.A. McReynolds L.A. Guan C.D. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of MBP, MBP-PPARγ1, and MBP-PPARδ by MAP kinase was performed as described previously (20Dudley D. Pang L. Decker S. Bridges A. Saltiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) using a bacterially expressed glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of 44-kDa MAP kinase (GST-MAP kinase) and the 45-kDa MEK (GST-MEK1). Using a PPARγ-specific polyclonal antibody (produced using the MBP-PPARγ fusion protein), 2H. Camp, A. L. Whitton, and S. T. Tafuri, submitted for publication. in vitro translated PPARγ1 and the mutant PPARγ1 (S82A) were immunoprecipitated and phosphorylated by active GST-MAP kinase as described above. Approximately 0.5 μg of the partially pure MBP-PPARγ1, phosphorylated or unphosphorylated, and 0.5 μg of MBP-RXRα protein were preincubated for 15 min in 1 × mobility shift assay buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 80 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.4 mm dithiothreitol) to allow heterodimer formation, or MBP-PPARγ1 was phosphorylated prior to heterodimerization with MBP-RXRα. Approximately 20 fmol of a32P-labeled double-stranded ARE7 PPRE-containing oligonucleotide probe (5′-AATTCAAGGCAGAAAGTGAACTCTGATCCAGTAAGAAG-3′) was added to the protein mix and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed in 5% 1 × TBE polyacrylamide gels. 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and transfected using a calcium phosphate transfection protocol according to the manufacturer (Stratagene). For in vivo labeling, transfected cells were serum-starved overnight in 0.5% bovine serum albumin/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pretreated with phosphate-free medium for 1 h, and subsequently incubated in 0.8 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were preincubated with either BRL49653 (25 μm) or PD98059 (40 μm) for 15 min followed by the addition of EGF (100 ng/ml). EGF stimulation proceeded for 5 or 15 min prior to removal of the media and cell lysis. Cells were harvested in radioimmune precipitation lysis buffer (10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, complete protease inhibitors, and 20 mm NaVO4). Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-PPARγ antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 16 h at 4 °C and resolved in 10% SDS-PAGE. To detect MAP kinase activity in 293T cells, whole cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-active MAP kinase antibody (Promega) and ECL system (Amersham). Transcription reporter assays were used to determine the effect of growth factors on the transcriptional activity of PPARγ1. The luciferase reporter constructs used in NIH3T3 cells contained the TK promoter (TKpGL3) or three copies of ARE7 PPRE elements upstream of the TK promoter (ARE7-TKpGL3). In the absence of co-transfected PPARγ1 and RXRα expression plasmids, no PPARγ ligand (BRL49653)-dependent transcription was observed from either the TkpGL3 or ARE7-TKpGL3 (Fig. 1 A). In the presence of PPARγ1 and RXRα, a 2-fold increase in transcription was observed from ARE7-TK reporter after 16 h of treatment with BRL49653. The addition of 100 ng/ml PDGF to these cells decreased both the basal and BRL49653-activated transcription from the ARE7. This suggests that at least a fraction of the activity from the ARE7-TKpGL3 plasmid in the absence of exogenously added ligand is due to the activation of the PPARγ1·RXRα heterodimer by endogenous ligands. This activity was also reduced by PDGF treatment. Close examination of the PPARγ amino acid sequence revealed that PPARγ1 contains one serine residue, Ser82, whose surrounding amino acids correspond to the consensus phosphorylation site for MAP kinase (Fig. 2 A) (22Gonzalez F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This site is absolutely conserved between human and mouse PPARγ1. A variation of the MAP kinase consensus site is also found in mouse PPARα at a similar position in the amino acid sequence. PPARδ lacks this site altogether (Fig. 2 A). Since both EGF and PDGF are known to activate MAP kinase in vivo, a CA-MEK that constitutively activates MAP kinase was co-transfected with ARE7-TKpGL3, PPARγ1, and RXRα expression plasmids. As shown in Fig. 1 B, CA-MEK decreased both the basal and the ligand-dependent PPARγ1 transcriptional activity in a dose-dependent manner. No significant effect was seen with the TKpGL3 parental reporter construct. This suggests that the intracellular signaling pathways activated by PDGF or EGF can modulate PPARγ1-dependent transcriptional activity. To determine if PPARγ1 can be phosphorylated by MAP kinase in vitro, partially purified MBP, MBP-PPARγ1, or MBP-PPARδ fusion proteins were incubated with preactivated GST-MAP kinase and [γ-32P]ATP under conditions that phosphorylate myelin basic protein, a known MAP kinase substrate. As shown in Fig. 2 B, MAP kinase efficiently phosphorylated PPARγ1 but not MBP-PPARδ or maltose-binding protein (data not shown). Coomassie staining verified that nearly equal amounts of intact proteins were loaded (Fig. 2 C). To determine if Ser82 is the residue phosphorylated in vitro, a mutation was introduced into PPARγ1 that changed Ser82 to Ala. Both the wild type PPARγ1 and the mutant PPARγ1 (S82A) werein vitro translated and immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-PPARγ antibody. The immunoprecipitated products were used as substrates in the in vitro MAP kinase assay. Mutation at Ser82 to Ala completely abolished the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of PPARγ1 (Fig.2 D), indicating that the Ser82 is the only amino acid in PPARγ1 that is phosphorylated by MAP kinase. Fig.2 E represents the PPARγ antibody Western blot of thein vitro translated proteins and shows that both proteins were expressed in the reticulocyte extracts. To determine if PPARγ1 is phosphorylated by growth factor treatment, 293T cells were transfected with PPARγ1, serum-starved for 24 h, and incubated with [32P]orthophosphate. To maintain more physiologic conditions, no phosphatase inhibitors were added to the cells prior to lysis. Whole cell lysates were prepared after EGF treatment and immunoprecipitated with a PPARγ-specific antibody. PPARγ1 was weakly phosphorylated in the absence of sera and growth factors; however, treatment with 100 ng/ml of EGF for 5 or 15 min increased PPARγ1 phosphorylation 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively (Fig.3 A, lanes 3 and 4). In 293T cells, EGF treatment stimulated MAP kinase activity as determined by Western blot analysis with the anti-active MAP kinase antibody (Fig.3 B, lanes 1 and 2). To determine if the MAP kinase signaling pathway is involved in the phosphorylation of PPARγ1, the transfected cells were pretreated with 40 μm PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor (20Dudley D. Pang L. Decker S. Bridges A. Saltiel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2595) Google Scholar) for 15 min prior to EGF treatment. PD98059 prevented EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of PPARγ1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 6), suggesting that MAP kinase activation is involved in the phosphorylation of PPARγ1. At this concentration, PD98059 inhibited MAP kinase activation by EGF (Fig. 3 B, lane 3). Interestingly, pretreatment of the cells with 25 μmBRL49653 for 15 min also reduced the EGF-dependent phosphorylation of PPARγ1 (Fig. 3 A, lane 5) without affecting the ability of EGF to stimulate MAP kinase activity (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). This implies that occupation of the ligand binding domain may inhibit the ability of MAP kinase to recognize and/or phosphorylate PPARγ1. To determine if Ser82 is the residue-phosphorylated in vivo in response to EGF treatment, the Ser82 → Ala PPARγ1 mutant was introduced into 293T cells, and in vivo labeling was performed in the presence and absence of 100 ng/ml EGF (Fig.4 A). Although phosphorylation of the wild type PPARγ1 was enhanced by EGF treatment as before, phosphorylation of the mutant was unaffected. Similar amounts of both mutant and wild type protein were expressed in the transfected cells, as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4 B). Since all PPARγ1 phosphorylation was abolished by this mutation, this result demonstrates that the MAP kinase site at Ser82 is the only phosphorylation site on PPARγ1. To verify that the negative regulation of PPARγ1 by growth factors was dependent upon PPARγ1 phosphorylation, NIH 3T3 cells were co-transfected with either the wild type PPARγ1 or Ser82→ Ala PPARγ1 mutant and ARE7-TKpGL3. Transfected cells were then treated with BRL49653 in the presence or absence of PDGF. Neither basal nor BRL49653-stimulated activity was affected by the Ser82→ Ala mutant. In contrast, the activity of the Ser82 → Ala mutant PPARγ1 was resistant to PDGF-mediated repression (Fig.5). To determine if phosphorylation affects PPARγ1 DNA binding, a mobility shift assay was performed on a labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the ARE7 PPRE with bothin vitro phosphorylated and unphosphorylated MBP-PPARγ1. As previously reported, PPARγ1 (Fig. 6, lane 2) alone did not bind to the ARE7 element (6Tontonoz, P., Hu, E., Graves, R., Budavari, A., and Spiegelman, B. (1994) Genes & Dev. 1224–1234Google Scholar). However, in the presence of RXRα, both the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of PPARγ1 bound equally well to the ARE7 probe (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 5). In addition, phosphorylation of preformed PPARγ1·RXRα heterodimer prior to mobility shift assay did not alter PPARγ1 DNA binding. The complexity of gene expression requires the utilization of multiple regulatory mechanisms to control both the quantity and activity of all components of the transcription machinery including upstream enhancer proteins. In this study, we have shown that activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathway by EGF and PDGF induces the phosphorylation of PPARγ1 on Ser82 and that this event decreases the ability of PPARγ1 to activate transcription. Mutation of the phosphorylated residue (Ser82) prevents PPARγ1 phosphorylation as well as the growth factor-mediated repression of PPARγ1-dependent transcription. This phosphorylation-mediated transcriptional repression is not due to a reduced capacity of the PPARγ1·RXRα complex to heterodimerize or recognize its DNA binding site but is due to its ability to become transcriptionally activated by ligand. The activity of several nuclear hormone receptors is regulated by phosphorylation. Okadaic acid-induced phosphorylation of the human β1 thyroid receptor enhances the DNA binding capacity of the protein and increases the ligand-mediated transcription (23Lin K. Ashizawa K. Cheng S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7737-7741Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of retinoic acid receptor α and RXRα modulates heterodimerization of the receptors and consequently increases DNA binding activity (24Lefebvre M.-P. Gaub M. Tahayato A.

In addition, the MAP kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Ser118 on the estrogen receptor causes a 1.8–2.3-fold increase in transcriptional activation by the AF1 domain (25Kato S. Endoh H. Masuhiro Y. Kitamoto T. Uchiyama S. Sasaki H. Masushige S. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. Kawashima H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Science. 1995; 270: 1491-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1722) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that in general phosphorylation of nuclear receptors enhances their transcriptional activity. In contrast, our data suggest that MAP kinase phosphorylation of PPARγ1 negatively regulates its function. EGF, PDGF, and fibroblast growth factor inhibit the conversion of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to adipocytes (15Navre M. Ringold G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1857-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Adachi H. Kurachi H. Homma H. Adachi K. Imai T. Morishige K. Matxuzawa Y. Miyake A.

Moreover, primary rat adipogenic precursor cells are also inhibited from becoming adipocytes in the presence of EGF (14Serrero G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and EGF-treated animals show retardation of the development of adipose tissue (16Serrero G. Mills D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of this inhibition is unknown, growth arrest is required for adipogenesis. It is presumed that activation of the intracellular signaling cascades by growth factors must interfere with the activity of the factors involved in differentiation. We suggest that this interference occurs with the activation of MAP kinase. The activation of MAP kinase by EGF or PDGF induces the phosphorylation of PPARγ1, which negatively regulates its activity, thereby preventing the progression of adipocyte differentiation. The one piece still missing in this puzzle is how insulin promotes adipocyte differentiation. Insulin, like other growth factors, induces MAP kinase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In fact, two recent publications suggest that insulin stimulation does induce the PPARγ1, PPARγ2, and PPARα phosphorylation (26Shalev A. Siegrist-Kaiser C. Yen P. Wahli W. Burger A. Chin W. Weier C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 137: 4499-4502Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 27Zhang B. Berger J. Zhou G. Elbrecht A. Biswas S. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D. Moller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to our data, both groups present data suggesting that the insulin induced phosphorylation enhances the transcriptional activity of the PPARs. The use of different growth factors and different cell lines may explain this discrepancy. Yet, Zhang et al. (27Zhang B. Berger J. Zhou G. Elbrecht A. Biswas S. White-Carrington S. Szalkowski D. Moller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31771-31774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) reported that mutation of the phosphorylated serine does not prevent the activation of PPARγ by insulin. In addition, expression of dominant negative MEK blocks the activity of PPARδ that is not phosphorylated by MAP kinase. This suggests that the activation of transcription by insulin in their system occurs through a mechanism independent of the MAP kinase-induced phosphorylation of PPARγ. Tontonoz et al.(9Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3132) Google Scholar) have shown that deletion of the N-terminal portion of PPARγ2, which lacks Ser82, enhances the ability of PPARγ to induce adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, recently Hu et al. (28Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the ectopic expression of a mutant PPARγ2 (a serine to alanine mutation at position 112 in PPARγ2, which is equivalent to Ser82 of PPARγ1) enhanced sensitivity to ligand-induced adipogenesis. These results strongly support the conclusion of the present paper. Additional studies on adipocyte function show that although insulin activates MAP kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin-dependent metabolic responses such as glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, and lipogenesis are unaffected by the inhibition of MAP kinase with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (29Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C. Waters S.B. Yamauchi K. Pessin J.E. Cuatrecasas P. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, the MEK inhibitor does not prevent or delay 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (data not shown). Since many of the effects of insulin in adipocytes do not utilize the MAP kinase signaling cascade, we suggest that other signaling events induced by insulin during adipogenesis more strongly regulate PPARγ activity than direct phosphorylation by MAP kinase. The molecular mechanism of inhibition of PPARγ via phosphorylation is yet to be determined. Data presented here show that under equilibrium conditions DNA binding of recombinant PPARγ1·RXRα complexes is unaffected by phosphorylation, implying that heterodimerization of the complex is also unaffected. This suggests that transcriptional activation by PPARγ1 is regulated by phosphorylation. Transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors is modulated upon the association of the receptors with co-activators (31Halachmi S. Marden E. Martin G. Mackay H. Abbondanza C. Brown M.

Soderstrom M. Horlein A. Halachmi S. Brown M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Because of allosteric changes in the receptor, ligand-bound receptor has a greater affinity for the co-activator than the co-repressor and thus enhances transcription (21Chen J.D. Evans R.M. Nature. 1995; 377: 454-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar, 33Horlein A.J. Naar A.M. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Gloss B. Kurokawa R. Ryan A. Kamei Y. Soderstrom M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1995; 377: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Since pretreatment with BRL49653 decreased receptor phosphorylation in cell culture, we speculate that phosphorylation, possibly by hindering ligand binding or preventing changes in receptor conformation, plays a role in the selectivity and/or affinity of PPARγ for the cofactors.

https://openalex.org/W2137347518,"Double-strand DNA break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination occurs through the RAD52 pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Its biological importance is underscored by the conservation of many RAD52 pathway genes, including RAD54, from fungi to humans. We have analyzed the phenotype of mouse RAD54-/- (mRAD54-/-) cells. Consistent with a DSB repair defect, these cells are sensitive to ionizing radiation, mitomycin C, and methyl methanesulfonate, but not to ultraviolet light. Gene targeting experiments demonstrate that homologous recombination in mRAD54-/- cells is reduced compared to wild-type cells. These results imply that, besides DNA end-joining mediated by DNA-dependent protein kinase, homologous recombination contributes to the repair of DSBs in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we show that mRAD54-/- mice are viable and exhibit apparently normal V(D)J and immunoglobulin class-switch recombination. Thus, mRAD54 is not required for the recombination processes that generate functional immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes."

To determine the role of the cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)/retinoblastoma protein (pRB) pathway in this response we treated MCF-7 breast cancer cells with the pure estrogen antagonist ICI 182780 to inhibit estrogen-induced gene expression and induce G<sub>1</sub> phase arrest. Subsequent treatment with 17β-estradiol resulted in the synchronous entry of cells into S phase commencing at 12 h. The proportion of cells in S phase reached a maximum of 60% at 21–24 h. Cells subsequently completed mitosis and entered a second semisynchronous round of replication. Entry into S phase was preceded by increased activity of both Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 and hyperphosphorylation of pRB, all within the first 3–6 h of estradiol treatment. The increase in Cdk4 activity was accompanied by increases in cyclin D1 mRNA and protein, indicating that an initiating event in the activation of Cdk4 was increased cyclin D1 gene expression. In contrast, the levels of Cdk2 and the CDK inhibitors p21 (WAF1/CIP1/SDI1) and p27 (KIP1) in total cell lysates and in cyclin E immunoprecipitates were unaltered at these early time points. However, an inhibitory activity was present in antiestrogen-pretreated cell lysates toward recombinant cyclin E-Cdk2 and was relieved by estradiol treatment. This activity was attributable predominantly to p21. These apparently conflicting data were resolved by performing gel filtration chromatography, which revealed that only a minority of cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes were active following estradiol treatment. Active complexes eluted at a higher molecular weight than inactive complexes, were relatively deficient in both p21 and p27, and contained Cdk2 with increased threonine 160 phosphorylation, consistent with a mechanism of activation of cyclin E-Cdk2 involving both reduced CDK inhibitor association and CDK-activating kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Cdk2. These results provide an explanation for the early activation of both cyclin D1-Cdk4 and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes that accompany G<sub>1</sub>-S phase progression in response to estradiol."
https://openalex.org/W2034649293,"Drug-selected intrachromosomal gene amplification by breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles is well documented in mammalian cells, but factors governing this mechanism are not clear. Here, we show that only some clastogenic drugs induce drug resistance through intrachromosomal amplification. We strictly correlate triggering of BFB cycles to induction of fragile site expression. We demonstrate a dual role for fragile sites in intrachromosomal amplification: a site telomeric to the selected gene is involved in initiation, while a centromeric site defines the size and organization of early amplified units. The positions of fragile sites relative to boundaries of amplicons found in human cancers support the hypothesis that fragile sites play a key role in the amplification of at least some oncogenes during tumor progression."

When Tay-Sachs mice were treated with N -butyldeoxynojirimycin, the accumulation of G M2 in the brain was prevented, with the number of storage neurons and the quantity of ganglioside stored per cell markedly reduced.

Results demonstrated that the first 125 base pairs of the SM α-actin promoter were sufficient to confer TGFβ responsiveness.

Atherosclerosis. 1991; 88: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

In addition to its effects on cell growth, TGFβ has also been implicated in differentiation of SMC and other mesenchymal-derived cells during development (10Zentella A. Massagué J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). Of particular interest, a recent study by Shah et al. (17Shah N, M. Groves A.K. Anderson D.J.

However, the molecular mechanisms whereby TGFβ up-regulates SM α-actin expression are not known, nor is it known whether TGFβ alters expression of other SMC differentiation marker proteins. SM α-actin expression has been shown to be governed by a complex interplay of both positive and negative acting cis elements (18Min B. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. J. Biol.

The aims of the present study were to address the following questions: 1) what sequences impart TGFβ responsiveness to the SM α-actin promoter? 2) Do the identified sites confer both basal and TGFβ inducible expression, or are these sequences unique to TGFβ induction? 3) What trans-acting factors interact with these sites? 4) Is TGFβ inducibility restricted to the SM α-actin gene or does TGFβ also stimulate expression of other SM differentiation marker genes including SM MHC and h1 calponin?

The mutated fragments were polymerase chain reaction amplified and subcloned into pCAT-Basic (Promega). The sequence was verified by the Sanger dideoxy-sequencing procedure (31Sanger F. Nicklen S.

After an incubation period of 12–14 h, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-free medium and TGFβ (2.5 ng/ml) or vehicle were added. Cells were harvested 72 h later by scraping into ice-cold buffer A (15 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 60 mmKCl, 15 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.15 mmspermine tetrahydrochloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) (38Pothier F. Ouellet M. Julien J.-P. Guérin S.L. DNA and Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared by four freeze-thaws, followed by 10 min heat inactivation at 65 °C; 95-μl aliquots of each cell extract were assayed for CAT activity by enzymatic butyrylation of tritiated chloramphenicol (DuPont NEN) (39Seed B. Sheen J.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). CAT activities were normalized as described previously (29Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Experiments were repeated two to six times and relative CAT activity data were expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless otherwise noted. Total RNA was isolated using TRI REAGENTTM(Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Extracted RNA was dissolved in sterile water and stored at −70 °C until use. RNA concentration was measured spectrophoretically. The probe used for SM α-actin detection consisted of a 512-bp EcoRI fragment that encoded for amino acids 202 to 374 of the human skeletal α-actin cDNA (a gift kindly provided by Drs. Gunning and Kedes, Veterans' Administration Medical Center, Palo Alto, CA). For detection of SM MHC transcripts, a 373-bp cDNA probe corresponding to amino acids 1659 to 1929 of the SM2 isoform of SM MHC (kindly provided by Drs. P. Babij and M. Periasamy) was used. This cDNA probe recognizes both the SM1 and SM2 isoforms of SM MHC but not nonmuscle MHC (40Babij P. Kawamoto S. White S. Adelstein R.S. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C607-C613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Babij P. Periasamy M. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 673-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). H1calponin transcripts were identified by a cDNA probe corresponding to the coding region spanning nucleotides 144 to 715 (kindly provided by M. Parmacek, University of Chicago). All cDNA probes were isolated from plasmid vector DNA by appropriate restriction enzyme digestions and gel purified (Bio-Rad, Prep-A-Gene). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN) by random primer extension (Prime-It, Stratagene). For Northern analysis, 10 or 15 μg of total RNA was diluted in loading buffer consisting of 0.2m MOPS, 0.05 m sodium acetate, 0.01m EDTA, 4% formaldehyde, and 65% formamide, denatured by treating for 10 min at 65 °C, and subsequently resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 6.1% formaldehyde and 10% loading buffer. Capillary transfer of RNA to a nylon membrane (Micron Separating, Westboro, MA) was carried out overnight in 10 × saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA buffer (2 m EDTA, 20m NaH2PO4 H2O, 298 mNaCl). Blots were air dried, exposed to an UV transilluminator for 1.5 min, and baked for 2 h under vacuum at 80 °C. Hybridization to cDNA probes and subsequent washes were carried out at 65 °C as described previously by Church and Gilbert (42Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7247) Google Scholar). Blots were then dried, quantified using an Image Quant PhosphorImager, and subsequently exposed to Kodak X-Omat K film at −70 °C. A 5.8-kbEcoRI human cDNA fragment for 18 S rRNA was released from pBR322 and used in Northern analysis for standardization of RNA loading and transfer (43Wilson G.N. Hollar B.A. Waterson J.R. Schmickel R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5367-5371Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared from confluent, growth-arrested SMC cultures stimulated with TGFβ (2.5 ng/ml) or vehicle for 4 h. Briefly, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped into 0.6 ml of ice-cold RIPA buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) plus protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 mmsodium orthovanadate), and passed through a 21-gauge needle for several times. Cell lysates were then incubated on ice for 30 min and microfuged for 20 min at 4 °C (protocol provided by Santa Cruz). Sample loading was normalized to DNA content determined with a DNA fluorometer (Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco). 600 ng of DNA was loaded per well on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE Mini-Protean gel (Bio-Rad). The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 100 V for 1.5 h. Blocking of the membrane and probing with appropriate antibodies were performed according to the ECL Western blotting protocol from Amersham and Life Science. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal SRF antibodies (Santa Cruz), raised against a peptide corresponding to SRF amino acids 486 to 505, were used as primary antibodies at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Crude nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (44Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9113) Google Scholar) using confluent, growth-arrested SMC stimulated with TGFβ or vehicle for 4 h. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Probes for EMSA were obtained by end labeling 20 μmsingle-stranded oligonucleotides with 150 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and unincorporated nucleotides were removed using NucTrap Push columns (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer. The following nucleotides were used either as a probe or as cold competitors (only sense strand shown): TCE, 5′-GAAGCGAGTGGGAGGGGAT-3′; TCE mut 2, 5′-GAAGCGAGTGTTAGGGGAT-3′; Sp1, 5′-GATCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGATC-3′; AP-1, 5′-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′. The 20-μl binding reaction contained ∼20,000 cpm labeled probe, 5 μg of nuclear extracts in Dignam buffer D, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 2.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 μg of poly(dA-dT) (Sigma), and cold competitor oligonucleotides where indicated. Recombinant human Sp1 was added at a concentration of 9 fpU per reaction (1 fpU defined as the amount of protein required to give full protection against DNase I of Sp1 sites within SV 40 early promoter (Promega)). All binding reactions were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. For Sp1 or Sp3 supershift assays, antibodies (2 μg/reaction) were added to the binding reaction and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The radiolabeled DNA was subsequently added to the binding reaction and incubated for additional 20 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel (30:1 acrylamide/bis-acrylamide (Bio-Rad)) and electrophoresed at 170 V in 0.5 × TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). The gels were then dried and subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C. In vitro synthesis of SRF was performed using a TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate translation system (Promega) and using the human SRF cDNA clone pT7ΔATG (45Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar) as a template. To examine the effects of TGFβ on SM α-actin mRNA expression, rat aortic SMC were grown to confluency, growth-arrested in SFM, and treated with 2.5 ng/ml TGFβ or vehicle. Total RNA was extracted from these cultures at the times indicated and subjected to Northern blot analysis for SM α-actin (Fig. 1). SM α-actin mRNA levels peaked at 3 h (9-fold) and then decreased over time (4.5-fold at 8 h and 2.5-fold at 32 h, data not shown). Addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (20 μg/ml) completely abolished TGFβ-induced increases in SM α-actin mRNA levels, suggesting that effects were dependent on new proteins of ongoing synthesis of proteins with relatively short half-lives. TGFβ also slightly induced nonmuscle (NM) β-actin mRNA expression. To determine whether increases in SM α-actin gene transcription contributed to TGFβ-induced increases in SM α-actin mRNA expression, transient transfection studies were performed in cultured rat aortic SMC using a construct containing 2.8 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence of the SM α-actin gene linked to a promoterless CAT reporter gene (pProm/CAT) (29Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Results demonstrated that TGFβ induced an ∼7-fold increase in activity of pProm/CAT above vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 2) suggesting that TGF-induced increases in SM α-actin mRNA were due, at least in part, to increased SM α-actin gene transcription. To identify the minimal sequences within the pProm/CAT construct that were required for TGFβ responsiveness, we tested a series of deletion mutant constructs. Transfection data indicated that the first 125 bp of the SM α-actin promoter were sufficient to confer full TGFβ responsiveness. Previous analysis of the promoter regions between −125 bp and −2.8 kb demonstrated that it contained negative regulatory elements required for cell-specific expression of the SM α-actin gene (29Shimizu R.T. Blank R.S. Jervis R. Lawrenz-Smith S.C. Owens G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7631-7643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Inclusion of these upstream sequences, however, did not alter TGFβ-induced stimulation of SM α-actin gene expression in SMC. To identify potential TGFβ response elements within the first 125 bp, we first performed a sequence analysis to determine whether the initial 125 bp of the SM α-actin promoter contained any known TGFβ response elements (46Sandler M.A. Zhang J.-N.

A 10-bp sequence spanning from −48 to −57 shared sequence similarities with a previously reported TGFβ response element designated as TGFβ inhibitory element (TIE) paradoxically found in promoters of several genes whose expression were inhibitedby TGFβ (51, 52; Table I). We analyzed this region by site-directed mutagenesis to test its importance for TGFβ responsiveness (Fig. 3 A). The design of mutants was based on those shown by Pietenpol et al. (51Pietenpol J.A. Münger K. Howley P.M. Stein R.W. Moses H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10227-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) to abolish TGFβ-mediated inhibition of the c-myc gene. Results of transient transfection studies demonstrated that TGFβ-induced stimulation of the SM α-actin gene was nearly completely abolished in all three mutant constructs (Fig.3 B). Mutations of this TGFβ responsive control element (henceforth designated “TCE”) also reduced basal transcriptional activity of p125 CAT by approximately half, even in the absence of exogenous TGFβ. We (53Stouffer G.A. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1992; 70: 820-828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and others (54Gibbons G.H. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 456-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar) have previously shown that cultured rat SMC produce active TGFβ. Thus, it is possible that the effect of mutation of the TCE on “basal” transcription was also TGFβ-dependent. To test this possibility, we incubated SMC with a TGFβ neutralizing antibody (raised in chicken, R&D) during the entire period following transfection. Control cells were treated with chicken IgG. In an attempt to maximize inhibition of autocrine produced TGFβ, high concentrations of TGFβ antibodies (2 μg/ml) were administered. Results demonstrated that addition of TGFβ antibodies reduced the basal transcriptional activity of wild-type p125 CAT by ∼50% as compared with controls (Fig. 4). In contrast, TGFβ neutralizing antibodies had no effect on the activity of TCE mutants, although in the presence of neutralizing TGFβ antibodies, basal transcriptional activity of the TCE mutants was about 50% lower than wild-type p125 CAT. Results of these studies indicate that endogenously produced TGFβ contributes to basal transcriptional activity of p125 CAT. It cannot be ascertained from these data, however, whether there is also a TGFβ independent mechanism that contributes to the reduced basal transcription seen with the TCE mutants (Fig. 4), since it cannot be determined if complete neutralization of TGFβ was achieved over the entire time course of the experiment.Table IComparison of a consensus TIE/TCE sequence first described in the promoters of genes inhibited by TGFβ (51Pietenpol J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2017145640,"rad54 mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are extremely X-ray sensitive and have decreased mitotic recombination frequencies because of a defect in double-strand break repair. A RAD54 homolog was disrupted in the chicken B cell line DT40, which undergoes immunoglobulin gene conversion and exhibits unusually high ratios of targeted to random integration after DNA transfection. Homozygous RAD54−/−mutant clones were highly X-ray sensitive compared to wild-type cells. The rate of immunoglobulin gene conversion was 6- to 8-fold reduced, and the frequency of targeted integration was at least two orders of magnitude decreased in the mutant clones. Reexpression of the RAD54 cDNA restored radiation resistance and targeted integration activity. The reported phenotype provides the first genetic evidence of a link between double-strand break repair and homologous recombination in vertebrate cells."
https://openalex.org/W2009082398,"Engagement of antigen and immunoglobulin receptors on hematopoietic cells is directly coupled to activation of nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) that then phosphorylate critical intracellular substrates. In mast cells stimulated through the FcvarepsilonRI receptor, activation of several PTKs including Syk leads to degranulation and release of such mediators of the allergic response as histamine and serotonin. Regulation of Syk function occurred through interaction with the Cbl protein, itself a PTK substrate in this system. Overexpression of Cbl led to inhibition of Syk and suppression of serotonin release from mast cells, demonstrating its ability to inhibit a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase. Complex adaptor proteins such as Cbl can directly regulate the functions of the proteins they bind."

Productivity in the freeboard (sea level) layer is also determined by sea ice porosity, which varies with temperature. Spatial and temporal variation in snow thickness and the proportion of first-year ice thus determine regional differences in sea ice primary production. Model results show that of the 40 teragrams of carbon produced annually in the Antarctic ice pack, 75 percent was associated with first-year ice and nearly 50 percent was produced in the Weddell Sea."

This activates a latent, MutH-associated endonuclease that incises the unmethylated strand of a hemimethylated d(GATC) sequence, which may be located either 5′ or 3′ to the mispair. The nick serves as the primary signal that directs repair to the unmethylated strand, and in the presence of DNA helicase II, exonucleolytic excision initiates at the nick and proceeds toward the mismatch through the action of either RecJ or exonuclease VII when incision is 5′ to the mismatch, or exonuclease I when the nick is 3′ to the mispair (28Cooper D.L.

The resulting single-strand gap is then filled by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and covalent continuity is restored to the repaired strand by DNA ligase. Single-stranded DNA-binding protein is also a required component of the reaction. Four activities have been implicated in the human mismatch repair reaction. MutSα (a heterodimer of MSH2 and MSH6) and MutLα (a heterodimer of MLH1 and PMS2) were isolated by virtue of their ability to restore strand-specific mismatch correction to nuclear extracts of repair-deficient tumor cell lines (16Drummond J.T.

This MutSβ complex binds to insertion/deletion mismatches and presumably plays a role in their processing. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) 1The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; HRP, horseradish peroxidase. has also been implicated in the human mismatch repair reaction (33Umar A.

However, the activities involved in the excision stage of the reaction and the DNA biosynthetic activity responsible for repair synthesis remain to be identified. To this end we have used biochemical methods to deplete nuclear extracts of a required repair activity and have used depleted extracts as the basis for an in vitro complementation assay to isolate additional components of the system. We describe here experiments implicating DNA polymerase δ in the human mismatch repair reaction. Human HeLa S3 cells were cultured and nuclear extracts prepared as described previously (16Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 34Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). All fractionation steps were performed at 0–4 °C. Samples of repair-proficient HeLa nuclear extract were resolved independently on heparin-Sepharose 4B (35Pirrotta V. Bickle T.A. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the immobilized dye resin Reactive Brown 10 (Sigma) to generate mismatch repair deficient fractions. HeLa nuclear extract (93 mg) was diluted with 0.025 mHEPES·KOH (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF, concentration relative to a 23 °C saturated solution in isopropanol), and 1 μg/ml leupeptin (buffer A) to make the conductivity equivalent to buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl, centrifuged briefly to remove insoluble material, and applied to a 5.5 cm × 1.5-cm2 column of heparin-Sepharose 4B equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. The material that flowed through the column, representing 80% of the starting material, was briefly dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.1m KCl, frozen in small aliquots with liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C (Fraction H1). Nuclear extract (70 mg) was resolved in a similar manner on a 5.1 cm × 0.8-cm2column of Reactive Brown 10 equilibrated in 0.025 mTris·HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% (saturated) PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.05m KCl. The material that did not bind the resin, representing 60% of the starting material, was treated as above (Fraction R1). In vitro mismatch repair assays with nuclear extracts (50 μg) and 100 ng (24 fmol) of heteroduplex f1MR DNA were performed as described previously (5Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H.

Briefly, this method uses a 6.4-kilobase pair circular heteroduplex that contains a site-specific, strand-specific incision to provide strand direction to the reaction. The presence of the mismatch within overlapping sites for two restriction endonucleases serves to block cleavage by either activity, with repair conferring sensitivity to one endonuclease or the other depending on which strand is corrected. Assay for complementation of depleted nuclear extract was performed in a similar manner, except reactions (20 μl) contained 35 μg of Fraction H1 and 27 μg of Fraction R1 (referred to below as H1/R1) in place of nuclear extract, and KCl was maintained at a final concentration of 105–110 mm taking into account salt contributed by depleted extract and column fractions. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and repair scored as described previously (5Parsons R. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Fang W.H. Papadopoulos N. Jen J. de la Chapelle A.

DNA polymerase activity was determined in reactions (50 μl) containing 0.02 m Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin, 0.01m MgCl2, 50 μm each dATP, dGTP, and dTTP, 50 μm [32P]dCTP (600–1900 cpm/pmol), and 40 μg of sonicated, DNase I-activated salmon sperm DNA. Trichloroacetic acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined after incubation at 37 °C for 60 min. When indicated, DNA polymerase activity was also determined in reactions (50 μl) containing 0.04m Tris·HCl (pH 6.8), 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg of acetylated bovine serum albumin, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm dATP, 50 μm[32P]dTTP (600–800 cpm/pmol), and 1 μg of either poly(dA-dT) or poly(dA)·oligo(dT)12–18, (20:1 nucleotide ratio). Acid-insoluble radioactivity was determined following incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The polymerase inhibitor butylphenyl-dGTP was a gift from George Wright (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA), and aphidicolin was from Sigma. HeLa nuclear extract (34Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) derived from 200 liters of culture (Fraction I, 100 ml, 23 mg/ml) was thawed on wet ice, diluted in buffer A to yield a conductivity equivalent to buffer A containing 0.02 m KCl, centrifuged at 12,000 × g to remove insoluble material, and applied at 100 ml/h to a phosphocellulose column (Whatman P-11, 18 cm × 12.6 cm2) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.02m KCl. The column was washed with 450 ml of equilibration buffer and developed with a linear gradient of KCl (2900 ml, 0.02–0.9m) in buffer A. Fractions that restored repair of a 5′-G·T heteroduplex to depleted H1/R1 nuclear extract eluted at ∼0.39 m KCl (Fraction II, 250 ml). Fraction II was dialyzed against buffer A containing 0.05 m KCl until the conductivity was equivalent to buffer A containing 0.085 mKCl, clarified as above, and applied at 25 ml/h to a heparin-Sepharose 4B column (14.6 cm × 1.75 cm2) equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.085 m KCl. The column was washed with 50 ml of equilibration buffer and developed with a 260-ml linear gradient of KCl (0.085–0.5 m) in buffer A. Fractions complementing depleted H1/R1 extracts eluted as a broad peak centered at ∼0.2m KCl (Fraction III, 84 ml). After freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at −80 °C, Fraction III was later thawed on wet ice and dialyzed against 0.025 m Tris·HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (buffer B) containing 0.085 m KCl until the conductivity was equivalent to buffer B containing 0.1 m KCl. After clarification by centrifugation, the dialysate was applied at 0.7 ml/min onto a 1.0-ml HR 5/5 Mono Q (Pharmacia) FPLC column equilibrated in buffer B containing 0.1 m KCl. The column was washed with 2 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of KCl (0.1–0.5 m) in buffer B. Fractions were supplemented with dithiothreitol to 1 mm and PMSF to 0.1% by the addition of concentrated stock solutions. Fractions complementing depleted H1/R1 extracts eluted at ∼0.31 mKCl (Fraction IV, 3.5 ml). Fraction IV was dialyzed against 0.025m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A (buffer C) also containing 0.085 m KCl until the conductivity was approximately equivalent to buffer C containing 0.085 m KCl. The dialysate was applied at 0.7 ml/min onto a 1.0-ml HR 5/5 Mono S (Pharmacia) FPLC column equilibrated in buffer C containing 0.085 m KCl. The column was washed with 3 ml of equilibration buffer, eluted with a 15-ml linear gradient of KCl (0.085–0.5 m) in buffer C, and fractions adjusted to 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1% PMSF as before. Fractions complementing depleted H1/R1 extracts eluted at ∼0.3 mKCl, and individual fractions were either used directly or frozen in small aliquots with liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Fraction V in Table I represents the column fractions (17–19, 2.4 ml) containing the peak of repair complementing activity.Table IPurification of H1/R1 complementing activity from 200 liters of HeLa cellsFractionTotal proteinSpecific activityYieldmgpmol/mg%I.

Copeland W.C. T. S. W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 809-820Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antiserum to DNA polymerase δ was raised in a New Zealand White rabbit against the synthetic multiple antigenic peptide LYQKEVSHLSALEERFSRLW, corresponding to residues 1036–1055 of the catalytic subunit of calf thymus DNA polymerase δ (37Zhang J.

Antibodies to human DNA polymerase ε were generously provided by Stuart Linn (University of California, Berkeley). Monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant rat PCNA were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human single-stranded DNA-binding protein (RPA) and rabbit antibodies raised against the DNA polymerase accessory factor RF-C were gifts from Jerard Hurwitz (Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York). Rabbit anti-chicken IgG cross-linked to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), rabbit anti-mouse IgG cross-linked to HRP, and goat anti-rabbit IgG cross-linked to HRP were from Sigma. Sheep anti-mouse IgG cross-linked to HRP was purchased from Amersham, and 125I-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG was from ICN. For immunological blot analysis, proteins were loaded onto 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrophoresed at 200 V in a mini-gel apparatus (Bio-Rad) until bromphenol blue present in the loading dye had run off the gel. Proteins were transferred to a nylon membrane (Biotrans, ICN), which was probed with primary antibodies as indicated, and immune complexes visualized using an ECL chemiluminescence kit (Amersham) in the case of peroxidase linked secondary antibodies, or by autoradiography in the case of 125I-labeled secondary antibodies. Immunopurified human KB cell DNA polymerase α was a gift of William Copeland (NIEHS, Research Triangle Park, NC). One unit of DNA polymerase α activity represents the amount of enzyme required to incorporate 1 nmol of labeled dNMP into activated salmon sperm DNA in 1 h at 37 °C (38Wang T.S. Copeland W.C. Rogge L. Dong Q. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Purified calf thymus DNA polymerase δ was a generous gift of Antero So (University of Miami, Miami, FL). One unit of DNA polymerase δ activity is defined as the incorporation of 1 nmol of dNMP into poly(dA)·oligo(dT) in 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of 2–4 μg/ml PCNA (39Downey K.M. So A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The plasmid pT7hPCNA, encoding human PCNA under the control of a T7 promoter, was a gift of Bruce Stillman (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). Human PCNA was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) and purified to apparent homogeneity by a modification of the method of Fein and Stillman (40Fien K. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In an effort to isolate unidentified activities involved in human mismatch repair, including those for which mutations might render cell lines inviable, we sought to generate biochemically deficient nuclear subfractions that were defective in mismatch repair in vitro. HeLa nuclear extract was resolved into crude bound and unbound fractions on both heparin-Sepharose 4B and Reactive Brown 10 resins (see “Experimental Procedures”). None of the individual subfractions obtained in this manner were able support mismatch repairin vitro, but reactions containing both unbound fractions (this mixture was designated H1/R1) converted DNA heteroduplexes into a new species with an eletrophoretic mobility consistent with that expected for a gapped DNA molecule (data not shown). This suggested that H1/R1 was lacking one or more components required for repair DNA synthesis. This depleted fraction proved to be deficient in a single required activity, a DNA polymerase required for the repair synthesis reaction. HeLa nuclear extract was resolved by chromatography on phosphocellulose, and column fractions were assayed for their ability to restore mismatch repair activity to depleted H1/R1 extract. This column yielded a single, symmetrical peak of complementing activity, which was further purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” and summarized in Table I. The most highly purified fraction (Fraction V) was enriched about 2,800-fold relative to nuclear extract. H1/R1 complementing activity was purified by virtue its ability to restore G·T heteroduplex repair. In addition to its inability to support G·T heteroduplex repair, H1/R1 extract was also defective in repair of a two-nucleotide insertion/deletion mismatch. As shown in Fig. 1, repair of both types of mismatch was fully restored by addition of Fraction V. Since strand directionality of the human mismatch repair reaction can be provided by a nick located either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch (41Fang W. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the ability of Fraction V to restore repair with both heteroduplex orientations was also tested. Fig. 1demonstrates that the activity of Fraction V is independent of mismatch → nick orientation. As noted above, although mismatch rectification did not occur in H1/R1 extract, heteroduplex processing was observed, with repair blocked at a late stage in the reaction. This suggested that the depleted extract might be deficient in a DNA polymerase required for repair synthesis, and polymerase activity was found to co-purify with complementing activity (Fig. 2), prompting further test of this possibility by immunological blot analyses. Whereas DNA polymerases α, δ, and ε were all present in HeLa nuclear extract, depleted H1/R1 extract contained DNA polymerase α and reduced levels of pol ε (∼ 5%), but pol δ was undetectable in this fraction (Fig.3). On the other hand, pol δ was the only DNA polymerase detected in Fraction V of complementing activity, and levels of this polymerase estimated by immunological blot analysis correlated well with H1/R1 complementing activity during purification, strongly suggesting that DNA polymerase δ was the required activity lacking in the depleted extract. Although PCNA and the human single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA were resolved from complementing activity during phosphocellulose chromatography, both were present in depleted extract, and this fraction also contained the polymerase accessory factor RF-C (Fig. 3 and data not shown).Figure 3Isolated complementing activity contains DNA polymerase δ, but is free of detectable polymerase α, polymerase ε, and PCNA. Immunological blot analysis was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A, DNA polymerase α antibody. Panel B, DNA polymerase δ antibody. Panel C, DNA polymerase ε antibody. Panel D, PCNA antibody. In each case lane 1 is complete HeLa nuclear extract (50 μg), lane 2 is depleted H1/R1 nuclear extract (50 μg), lane 3 is fraction 16 from the Mono S column (Fig. 2, 440 ng), and lane 4 is fraction 19 (290 ng). Two faint bands with the approximate mobility of the pol δ catalytic subunit are evident in the H1/R1 fraction (lane 2 ofpanel B). However, analysis of several gels of this sample has indicated that full-length pol δ migrates between these two bands. Hence, H1/R1 appears to be essentially free of detectable pol δ, although we cannot rule out presence of degradation products derived from this polypeptide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The participation of DNA polymerase δ in mismatch repair is also supported by chemical inhibition of repair and DNA polymerase activities. Mismatch repair in HeLa nuclear extracts is blocked by aphidicolin, indicating involvement of DNA polymerases α, δ, and/or ε in the reaction (34Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). We have confirmed this observation with the finding that 100 μm aphidicolin completely inhibited repair when depleted H1/R1 extract was complemented with Fraction IV of the purified activity, and DNA synthesis on activated salmon sperm DNA supported by Fraction V was reduced approximately 2-fold by 100 μm aphidicolin. Furthermore, neither Fraction IV DNA polymerase activity nor repair activity in complemented H1/R1 extract was inhibited by 10 μm butylphenyl-dGTP (data not shown), suggesting that DNA polymerase α does not have a critical role in mismatch repair (42Brown N.C. Wright G.E. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 202-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). While the foregoing experiments suggested that depletion of pol δ accounted for the repair deficiency of H1/R1 extract, H1/R1 complementing activity was only partially purified, with Fraction V containing about 50 distinct protein species as judged by silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To test the sufficiency of pol δ in restoration of repair to H1/R1 extract, the complementing activity of bona fide pol δ was tested. As shown in Fig.4, mismatch repair in the depleted extract was restored to a similar degree by either calf thymus pol δ or Fraction V of the complementing activity isolated here. By contrast, human pol α did not complement the depleted extract. Furthermore, repair activity restored by either pol δ or Fraction V was further enhanced by about 40% upon supplementation of H1/R1 extract with additional exogenous PCNA. This finding is consistent with previous experiments implicating PCNA in repair (33Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), although in our case the presence of PCNA in the depleted extract (Fig. 3 D) prevents a more quantitative assessment of the role of this activity in the reaction. It is noteworthy that PCNA (150–200 ng) was found to stimulate DNA polymerase activity of isolated complementing activity about 2-fold on activated salmon sperm DNA or poly(dA-dT) template-primers, but by more than 10-fold with poly(dA)·oligo(dT) (data not shown). Stimulation of DNA polymerase activity by PCNA on this template-primer is a hallmark of pol δ (43Tan C.-K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 12310-12316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Prelich G. Tan C.K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. So A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) and provides further evidence that this activity is the major DNA biosynthetic activity present in the fractions isolated here. This work presents direct evidence for involvement of DNA polymerase δ in human mismatch repair. We have shown that pol δ is required for repair of base-base mismatches and small insertion/deletion heterologies, and that the requirement for this activity is evident when the single strand break that directs the reaction is located either 5′ or 3′ to the mispair. These findings indicate that pol δ plays a general role in the reaction. While we cannot exclude participation of DNA polymerases α or ε in mismatch repair due to the presence of significant levels of both activities in depleted H1/R1 extract, the observed insensitivity of repair to butylphenyl-dGTP renders pol α an unlikely candidate. Furthermore, while the residual level of pol ε in repair-deficient, depleted extract (∼ 5% of that present in fully active HeLa extracts, Fig. 3) was insufficient to support repair, isolated complementing activity was devoid of detectable levels of this polymerase. Thus, either the human mismatch repair reaction requires both pol δ and pol ε, or pol δ is sufficient to meet the polymerase requirement in the reaction. We tend to favor the latter possibility. Results obtained withSaccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase mutants may also bear on this point. Strand et al. (45Strand M. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Petes T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) demonstrated that inactivation of the proofreading function of yeast pol δ results in a 5–10-fold increase in mutation rate of d(CA)n repeat sequences, but proofreading mutations in pol ε do not. It is difficult to reconcile the different phenotypes based solely on the functional roles of the two polymerases in chromosome replication (46Wang T.S.-F. DePamphilis M. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 461-493Google Scholar), but differential participation of the two enzymes in mismatch repair might account for this difference since d(CA)n mutability correlates strongly with mismatch repair defects (45Strand M. Prolla T.A. Liskay R.M. Petes T.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 274-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). Umar et al. (33Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) have recently found that dinucleotide repeats are unstable in yeast PCNA mutants and, as judged by two hybrid analysis, that PCNA interacts with yeast MutL homologs PMS1 and MLH1 (human PMS2 is a homolog of yeast PMS1). They also demonstrated that mismatch repair in human cell extracts is blocked prior to the excision step by p21WAF1 or by a p21 peptide, which binds to PCNA and inhibits PCNA-dependent DNA replication (47Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). While PCNA involvement would be consistent with a repair role for pol δ since the two proteins are known to interact (44Prelich G. Tan C.K. Kostura M. Mathews M.B. So A.G. Downey K.M. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar, 48Bravo R. Frank R. Blundell P.A. Macdonald-Bravo H.

Available information on the nature of the human mismatch repair reaction has indicated striking similarities to the bacterial pathway, including conservation of specificity and mechanism, and involvement of homologs of MutS and MutL at early steps of the reaction (reviewed in Ref. 2Modrich P. Lahue R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 101-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). The work described here extends these similarities to the DNA polymerase requirement. Repair DNA synthesis in E. colimethyl-directed mismatch correction is catalyzed by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, the enzyme that is also responsible for chromosome replication. Like DNA polymerase III, pol δ plays a major role in the synthesis of new DNA strands at the replication fork, a function it probably shares with pol ε (46Wang T.S.-F. DePamphilis M.

https://openalex.org/W2167106460,"The crystal structure of the arabinose-binding and dimerization domain of the Escherchia coli gene regulatory protein AraC was determined in the presence and absence of l -arabinose. The 1.5 angstrom structure of the arabinose-bound molecule shows that the protein adopts an unusual fold, binding sugar within a β barrel and completely burying the arabinose with the amino-terminal arm of the protein. Dimer contacts in the presence of arabinose are mediated by an antiparallel coiled-coil. In the 2.8 angstrom structure of the uncomplexed protein, the amino-terminal arm is disordered, uncovering the sugar-binding pocket and allowing it to serve as an oligomerization interface. The ligand-gated oligomerization as seen in AraC provides the basis of a plausible mechanism for modulating the protein’s DNA-looping properties."
https://openalex.org/W2049900563,"The severity of the malaria pandemic in the tropics is aggravated by the ongoing spread of parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs and mosquito resistance to insecticides. A strain of Anopheles gambiae , normally a major vector for human malaria in Africa, can encapsulate and kill the malaria parasites within a melanin-rich capsule in the mosquito midgut. Genetic mapping revealed one major and two minor quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for this encapsulation reaction. Understanding such antiparasite mechanisms in mosquitoes may lead to new strategies for malaria control."
https://openalex.org/W2052201373,"Caveolae are plasma membrane microdomains that are enriched in caveolin, the structural protein of caveolae, sphingomyelin, and other signaling molecules. We previously suggested that neurotrophin-induced p75NTR-dependent sphingomyelin hydrolysis may be localized to the plasma membrane. Therefore, we examined if caveolae were a major site of p75NTR-dependent sphingomyelin hydrolysis in p75NTR-NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Caveolin-enriched membranes (CEMs) were prepared by either detergent or detergent-free extraction and separated from noncaveolar membranes by centrifugation through sucrose gradients. Immunoblot analysis of the individual gradient fractions indicated that caveolin and p75NTR were enriched in CEMs. The localization of p75NTR to CEMs was not an artifact of receptor overexpression in the fibroblasts because a similar distribution of p75NTR was evident from PC12 cells, which endogenously express p75NTR. In the p75NTR fibroblasts, nerve growth factor induced a time-dependent hydrolysis of sphingomyelin only in CEMs with no hydrolysis detected in noncaveolar membranes. Intriguingly, endogenous p75NTR was found to co-immunoprecipitate with caveolin, suggesting that p75NTR may associate with caveolin in vivo. This interaction was confirmed in vitro by the co-immunoprecipitation of a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein expressing the cytoplasmic domain of p75NTR with caveolin. Collectively, these results demonstrate that neurotrophin-induced p75NTR-dependent sphingomyelin hydrolysis localizes to CEMs and suggest that the interaction of p75NTR with caveolin may affect signaling through p75NTR.

The neurotrophins are a family of growth factors involved in the survival, development, and death of specific populations of neurons and glial cells (1Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 262-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The signal transduction systems that mediate these divergent biologies are initiated by the interaction of neurotrophins with two classes of cell surface receptors (2Chao M.V.

In contrast, recent data suggest that neurotrophin-mediated death signals are generated through the interaction of nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; CEM, caveolin enriched membrane; NCM, noncaveolar membrane; MES, 2-(4-mopholino)ethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; SM, sphingomyelin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; CEM, caveolin enriched membrane; NCM, noncaveolar membrane; MES, 2-(4-mopholino)ethanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; SM, sphingomyelin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. with a transmembrane protein known as the low affinity neurotrophin receptor, p75NTR (10Cassacia-Bonnefil P.

Science. 1996; 274: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the signaling mechanisms used by p75NTR are still uncertain, we have demonstrated that p75NTR couples to sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis, producing the bioactive sphingolipid metabolite ceramide (13Dobrowsky R.T.

Ceramide production following ligand binding of p75NTR has been implicated in antiproliferative responses in glial cells (15Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, exogenous ceramide mimicked the effect of NGF on cell growth inhibition and differentiation of rat T9 glioma cells (13Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino A.M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Additionally, NGF-induced p75NTR-dependent apoptosis correlates with an early and prolonged increase in cellular ceramide levels in mature oligodendrocytes (10Cassacia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Further, NGF-induced p75NTR-dependent ceramide production has been implicated in regulating dopamine release in primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons (16Blochl A. Sirrenberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21100-21107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The coupling of p75NTR to ceramide production and the emerging role of this receptor-effector system in glial and neuronal biologies necessitates the identification of the signal-sensitive pool of lipid, localization of the specific compartment for signal generation/regeneration, and defining the site of interaction with potential downstream effector molecules. Previous studies have suggested that ligand-induced SM hydrolysis may use a plasma membrane pool of SM, which is not effected by treatments that inhibit receptor internalization (14Dobrowsky R.T.

Caveolae are dynamic microdomains of the plasma membrane that are enriched in SM and remain associated with the cell surface (19Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar), suggesting that caveolae may be localized sites for ligand-induced SM hydrolysis. Indeed, interleukin-1β treatment of dermal fibroblasts induced SM hydrolysis and ceramide generation within caveolae (20Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Moreover, caveolae have been implicated as sites for signal transduction via the epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (21Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 22Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Thus, caveolae are emerging as important signaling compartments within the plasma membrane (23Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 213-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Caveolin is the major protein component of caveolae and is necessary for formation of intact caveolae (23Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 213-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Caveolin serves as a scaffolding protein (24Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K.

Moreover, caveolin can interact with proteins in a very specific manner such that only inactive forms of G-proteins are found associated with caveolin (25Li S. Okamoto T. Chum M. Sargiacomo M.

Thus, caveolin may be an important component of receptor/effector systems localized within caveolae. The abundance of SM within caveolae and the role of caveolin in sequestering signaling molecules led us to examine if p75NTR-dependent SM hydrolysis localized to caveolae and if this receptor interacted with caveolin. We demonstrate herein that p75NTR and caveolin co-localize and that p75NTR-dependent SM hydrolysis occurs within CEMs. Further, p75NTR was found to co-immunoprecipitate with caveolin from CEMs. Collectively, these results suggest that caveolae may provide a highly localized site for neurotrophin-induced SM hydrolysis and that the association of p75NTR with caveolin may have a functional role in neurotrophin signaling through p75NTR.

Protein A-Sepharose and glutathione-Sepharose were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. All tissue culture media and geneticin were products of Life Technologies, Inc. The production and characterization of the p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells has been previously described (29Mahadeo D. Kaplan L. Chao M.V. Hempstead B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6884-6891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). p75NTR-NIH 3T3 and PC12 cells were cultured as described (14Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells stably transfected with a pCMV vector lacking the p75NTR cDNA insert were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum containing 0.2 mg/ml geneticin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. CEMs were prepared by either detergent or nondetergent extraction of cell proteins and centrifugation over discontinuous sucrose gradients essentially as described (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 30Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugririene J. Tang Z. HermanowskiVosatka A. Tu Y. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in 15-cm tissue culture dishes, and two dishes of cells were used to prepare the CEMs. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with 2 × 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were scraped into 2 ml of ice-cold MBST buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Pefabloc) and homogenized with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes). The extract was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose in MBS lacking Triton X-100 and placed in the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed by overlaying this solution with 4 ml of 38% sucrose and 4 ml of 5% sucrose (both in MBS). The tubes were centrifuged at 31,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor for 16–18 h at 4 °C and 15 × 0.8 ml fractions were collected manually from the top of the gradient. Aliquots of each fraction were used for the determination of protein content (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (208058) Google Scholar). To determine the distribution of p75NTR and caveolin within the gradient, 0.075 ml of each fraction were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% acrylamide gels followed by immunoblotting. Following SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membrane was stained with 0.5% Ponceau S to visualize total protein. As described previously (30Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugririene J. Tang Z. HermanowskiVosatka A. Tu Y. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), the bulk of the cellular proteins remained in fractions 10–15 of the gradient (data not shown). The membrane was typically cut in half at about the 44-kDa molecular mass marker, and the upper half of the blot was used to probe for p75NTR (75 kDa), and the lower half of the blot was used to probe for caveolin (22–24 kDa). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). In some experiments, CEMs were prepared by nondetergent extraction with sodium carbonate (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Detergent-free extraction of the cells was performed as above with the following modifications. The cells were scraped into 2 ml of 0.5 m sodium carbonate, pH 11, and homogenization was carried out sequentially with a loose fitting Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (3 × 10-s bursts), and a sonicator (3 × 20-s bursts). The extract was brought to 45% sucrose (in MBS), and the discontinuous gradient was formed as above in sucrose solutions prepared in MBS containing 0.25m sodium carbonate (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Following centrifugation, individual fractions were collected as above. In some experiments, the individual gradient fractions were pooled into CEM (fractions 4–7), NCM-1 (fractions 8–11), and NCM-2 (fractions 12–15). The membranes from the pooled gradient fractions were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 0.5 h at 4 °C. The isolated membrane fractions were used for immunoprecipitation or to measure lipid content. The membrane pellets from the CEM, NCM-1, and NCM-2 were resuspended in 0.3 ml of IP buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mmEDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 60 mmβ-octylglucoside, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and bestatin). The samples were precleared with 2 μg of IgG for 0.5 h at 4 °C. Following removal of IgG with protein A-Sepharose, 2 μg of anti-caveolin polyclonal antibody was added, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were formed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose and rotation for 1 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were sedimented by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microfuge and washed with 3 × 1 ml of ice-cold MBST. The bound proteins were solubilized in sample buffer, and p75NTR and caveolin were detected by immunoblotting as described above. In experiments utilizing GST-p75NTR, the fusion protein was purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose (25Li S. Okamoto T. Chum M. Sargiacomo M. Casanova J.E. Hansen S.H. Nisihimoto I. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15693-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The purified fusion protein was released from the glutathione-Sepharose beads, and 0–30 μg of the fusion protein incubated directly with CEMs solubilized in IP buffer. Caveolin was immunoprecipitated, and the GST-p75NTR fusion protein was detected by immunoblotting with p75NTR antiserum or a monoclonal antibody against the GST affinity handle. Cellular SM pools were labeled with [3H]choline, and SM was quantitated as described previously (14Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To determine if a pool of p75NTR may localize to CEMs, we subjected p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells to sodium carbonate extraction and analyzed the individual gradient fractions for the distribution of p75NTR and caveolin. Immunoblot analysis for p75NTR and caveolin revealed that a large pool of p75NTR co-migrated with caveolin (Fig. 1). Because fibroblasts do not endogenously express p75NTR, it was possible that the presence of p75NTR in CEMs was an artifact of receptor overexpression in the fibroblasts. Therefore, we determined whether p75NTR co-localized with CEMs isolated from PC12 cells, which endogenously express p75NTR. Fractionation of PC12 cells under the above conditions resulted in a similar distribution of p75NTR within the gradient (Fig. 2). However, immunoblot analysis did not detect caveolin, indicating that PC12 cells either do not express caveolin or that they express an isoform not recognized by the polyclonal antibody used in these experiments. The sedimentation of the membranes within this area of the sucrose gradient is indicative of a high buoyant density, suggesting that a pool of p75NTR associates with areas of the membrane enriched in glyco-sphingolipids but not necessarily enriched in caveolin (33Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 122: 789-807Google Scholar). Interestingly, detergent extraction of either the p75NTR-NIH 3T3 fibroblasts or the PC12 cells resulted in less p75NTRmigrating in fractions 4–7 than was apparent under conditions of detergent-free extraction (data not shown). However, in the fibroblasts, caveolin still primarily migrated to fractions 4–7 due to the marked insolubility of this protein in Triton X-100 (33Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J. Cell Biol... 1993; 122: 789-807Google Scholar). Differences in the amount of p75NTR co-migrating with CEMs under conditions of detergent versus detergent-free extraction may be due to detergent solubilization of a palmitoylated form of p75NTR (35Barker P.A. Barbee G. Misko T.P. Shooter E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30645-30650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified that detergent extraction results in the loss of other lipid-modified proteins from CEMs (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). In contrast, detergent-free extraction of the cells with sodium carbonate facilitates the recovery of lipid-modified proteins within CEMs (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 34Chang W.-J. Ying Y.-S. Rothberg K.G. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Gambliel H.A. Gunzburg J.D. Mumby S.M. Gilman A.G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Indeed, labeling of the p75NTRfibroblasts with [3H]palmitate followed by detergent extraction resulted in the majority of palmitoylated p75NTRmigrating in fractions 9–15, suggesting that detergent extraction may affect the partitioning of p75NTR between CEMs and NCMs (data not shown). We have previously reported that neurotrophins hydrolyze an internal pool of SM (14Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because the CEMs are enriched in SM (19Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2567) Google Scholar, 20Liu P. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and contain a significant pool of p75NTR, we asked whether neurotrophin-induced SM hydrolysis localized to this region of the plasma membrane. We treated p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells with phosphate-buffered saline or NGF, detergent-extracted the cells, and fractionated the membranes as above. The majority of the SM (47%) migrated in fractions 4–7, with the remainder primarily distributed to fractions 12–15 (35%). However, analysis of the amount of SM within each fraction revealed that NGF hydrolyzed SM solely in the CEMs, fractions 4–7 (Fig. 3). To determine if the method of preparation of CEMs had any effect on the distribution of the neurotrophin sensitive pool of SM, we treated [3H]choline-labeled cells with phosphate-buffered saline or NGF and subjected them to detergent-free extraction. As expected, about 95% of the total SM recovered in the gradient fractions migrated within the CEMs (fractions 4–7) following sodium carbonate extraction (Table I). NGF increased SM hydrolysis in the CEMs in a time-dependent manner such that up to 19% of the SM within this fraction was hydrolyzed within 12 min (Table I). We conclude that although the extraction method used for the preparation of CEMs effects the distribution of p75NTR and SM within the sucrose gradient, the primary signal-sensitive pool of SM still localizes to CEMs. Intriguingly, neurotrophin-3 also induced SM hydrolysis primarily in fractions 4–7 from membranes isolated from PC12 cells (data not shown). Because the PC12 cells lacked caveolin, these results suggest that the presence of caveolin is not necessary for the coupling of p75NTR to SM hydrolysis. p75NTR-NIH 3T3 cells were treated for 8–15 min in the absence or the presence of 100 ng/ml NGF in a 37 °C degree water bath and CEMs isolated by detergent-free extraction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Individual gradient fractions were pooled into CEMs (fractions 4–7), NCM-1 (fractions 8–11), and NCM-2 (fractions 12–15). The membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the amount of SM within the membrane fractions was determined. The percentage of SM hydrolyzed was based upon time matched controls. Columns showing the percentage of total SM in each fraction are from NGF-treated cells. The distribution in control cells was identical. The data shown are from one experiment performed twice with similar results. Caveolin can associate with the endothelin Type A receptor (28Chun M.

These observations, together with the results described above, led us to investigate whether p75NTR may directly interact with caveolin. The p75NTR-NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were subjected to detergent-free extraction, and the membranes were separated over the sucrose gradient as described. Based upon the fractionation pattern of p75NTRshown in Fig. 1, the individual fractions were combined into CEMs (fractions 4–7), NCM-1 (fractions 8–11), and NCM-2 (fractions 12–15). Fractions 1–3 were discarded because they were found to contain minimal protein and no p75NTR or caveolin. The membranes from the pooled fractions were sedimented by centrifugation and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with a polyclonal anti-caveolin antibody. Fig. 4 A shows that the caveolin antibody immunoprecipitated caveolin from the CEMs as well as some caveolin present in the concentrated NCMs. However, the majority of caveolin was observed in the CEMs. The presence of two caveolin bands in the CEMs represent the α and β isoforms of this protein (26Song K.S. Li S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9690-9697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Although no caveolin was detected in the individual fractions comprising NCM-1 and NCM-2 (Fig. 1), concentrating the membrane fractions may help immunoprecipitate caveolin being processed and transported to the caveolae. Intriguingly, p75NTR only co-immunoprecipitated with caveolin from CEMs, despite the presence of significant amounts of p75NTR within the other gradient fractions, especially NCM-2 (fractions 12–15, Fig. 1). These results suggest that p75NTRmay specifically interact in vivo with organized forms of caveolin that are only present within caveolae (24Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Importantly, the caveolin antibody did not immunoprecipitate any caveolin nor p75NTR from membranes isolated from fractions 4–7 from PC12 cells (Fig. 4 A). Because PC12 cells do not express any proteins recognized by the caveolin antibody, these results indicate that p75NTR was not nonspecifically associating with the antibody. Additionally, the caveolin antibody did not co-immunoprecipitate p75NTR from CEMs nor NCMs isolated from mock transfected fibroblasts, strongly supporting that caveolin can specifically associate with p75NTR in cells expressing both caveolin and p75NTR (Fig. 4 B). To further confirm that p75NTR could associate with caveolin, we examined the ability of a GST-p75NTR fusion protein expressing the full-length cytoplasmic domain of p75NTR to associate with caveolin in vitro. CEMs isolated from mock transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were incubated with 0 or 30 μg of the GST-p75NTR fusion protein. Subsequently, caveolin was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal caveolin antibody. After formation of the immune complexes with protein A-Sepharose, the bound proteins were solubilized and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, the blots were cut in half just above the 32-kDa molecular marker, and the upper half of the blot was probed with either the p75NTR antiserum (Fig.5 A) or a monoclonal antibody against the GST affinity handle (Fig. 5 B). In both panels, the lower portion of the blots were probed with the anti-caveolin antibody. Fig. 5(A and B) shows that the caveolin antibody co-immunoprecipitated the GST-p75NTR fusion protein as detected using either the p75NTR antiserum or the GST antibody. As expected, caveolin was equally immunoprecipitated in all instances. Importantly, the caveolin antibody did not co-immunoprecipitate any p75NTR or GST immunoreactive bands from CEMs incubated with GST only (Fig. 5 C). Thus, co-immunoprecipitation of the GST-p75NTR fusion protein with caveolin was not mediated by an interaction between caveolin and the GST affinity handle. Collectively, these results strongly support that caveolin can directly associate with a region within the cytoplasmic domain of p75NTR. Caveolae are emerging as highly localized sites for lipid signaling events. Indeed, recent results indicate that epidermal growth factor-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-bis-phosphate also occurs solely within CEMs from A431 cells (36Pike L.J. Casey L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26453-26456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Moreover, caveolae may serve as sites for cross-talk between tyrosine kinase and lipid signaling pathways. Because signaling via the epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor receptors occurs within CEMs (21Liu P. Ying Y. Ko Y.-G. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10299-10303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar,22Mineo C. James G.L. Smart E.J. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11930-11935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), other receptor-linked tyrosine kinases may be resident in CEMs. These results raise the possibility that localization of p75NTRsignaling to CEMs may have functional significance for cross-talk between Trk and p75NTR signaling pathways. We and others have reported that activation of Trk tyrosine kinases can inhibit p75NTR-dependent SM hydrolysis and ceramide generation (14Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 16Blochl A. Sirrenberg C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21100-21107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, co-localization of p75NTR with Trk receptors within caveolae may enrich p75NTR in an area of the plasma membrane where it can effectively couple to its putative effector system (SM hydrolysis/ceramide generation) or interact with the Trk effector system. p75NTR has been demonstrated to associate with the 42- and 44-kDa forms of mitogen activated protein kinase (37Volonte C. Angelastro J.M. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21410-21415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an undefined 120/104-kDa kinase (38Canossa M. Twiss J.L. Verity A.N. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and two unidentified phosphoproteins of 60 and 130 kDa (39Ohmichi M. Decker S. Saltiel A.R. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the role of these proteins in p75NTRsignaling remains unknown. The role of caveolin as a scaffolding protein involved in organizing and sequestering signaling molecules within caveolae (23Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 213-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 24Sargiacomo M. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Kubler E. Song K. Sanders M.C. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9407-9411Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) suggests that the association of caveolin with p75NTR may have functional consequences for p75NTRsignaling. For example, the association of p75NTR with caveolin may directly or indirectly impart specificity to neurotrophin signaling through p75NTR. Recent results indicate that NGF but not BDNF nor neurotrophin-3 can activate NF-κB in primary cultures of Schwaan cells (40Carter B.D. Kaltschmidt C. Kaltschmidt B. Offenhauser N. BohmMatthaei R. Baeuerle P.A. Barde Y. Science. 1996; 272: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) and induce apoptosis in primary cultures of mature oligodendrocytes (10Cassacia-Bonnefil P. Carter B.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Chao M.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Presumably, both of these effects are mediated through NGF-induced p75NTR-dependent ceramide generation. Thus, although all the neurotrophins can couple to SM hydrolysis through p75NTR in transfected fibroblasts overexpressing the receptor (14Dobrowsky R.T. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), in primary cultures of glial cells, other factors must affect neurotrophin signaling through p75NTR. In conclusion, the localization of p75NTR-dependent SM hydrolysis to CEMs extends our previous observations on p75NTR signaling through SM metabolism and in the broader perspective implicates caveolin as a potentially important component in affecting cellular responses to neurotrophins through p75NTR.

https://openalex.org/W2144579189,"A new member of the human cystatin superfamily, called cystatin E, has been found by expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing in amniotic cell and fetal skin epithelial cell cDNA libraries. The sequence of a full-length amniotic cell cDNA clone contained an open reading frame encoding a putative 28-residue signal peptide and a mature protein of 121 amino acids, including four cysteine residues and motifs of importance for the inhibitory activity of Family 2 cystatins like cystatin C. Recombinant cystatin E was produced in a baculovirus expression system and isolated. An antiserum against the recombinant protein could be used for affinity purification of cystatin E from human urine, as confirmed by N-terminal sequencing. The mature recombinant protein processed by insect cells started at amino acid 4 (cystatin C numbering), and displayed reversible inhibition of papain and cathepsin B (<i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> values of 0.39 and 32 nm, respectively), in competition with substrate. Cystatin E is thus a functional cysteine proteinase inhibitor despite relatively low amino acid sequence similarities with human cystatins (26–34% identity with sequences for the Family 2 cystatins C, D, S, SN, and SA; <30% with the Family 1 cystatins, A and B, and domains 2 and 3 of the Family 3 cystatin, kininogen). Unlike other human low <i>M</i> <sub>r</sub> cystatins, cystatin E is a glycoprotein, carrying an <i>N</i>-linked carbohydrate chain at position 108. Northern blot analysis revealed that the cystatin E gene is expressed in most human tissues, with the highest mRNA amounts found in uterus and liver. A strikingly high incidence of cystatin E clones in cDNA libraries from fetal skin epithelium and amniotic membrane cells (>0.5% of clones sequenced) indicates a protective role of cystatin E during fetal development."
https://openalex.org/W2026233197,"Many receptor tyrosine kinases possess an “activation loop” containing three similarly placed tyrosine autophosphorylation sites.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 21-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A physical model that begins to account for the roles of the three conserved kinase domain tyrosines is provided by the crystal structure of the non-phosphorylated insulin receptor kinase domain (37Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). This structure indicates that the three kinase domain tyrosines lie near the catalytic core of the kinase within an “activation loop” that prevents binding of ATP as well as physical approximation of the amino and carboxyl lobes of the kinase domain. The activation loop appears to be stabilized in this inhibitory conformation by interactions of Tyr-1162 (the homologue of Tyr-674 in TRK) with residues near the catalytic core of the kinase. This interaction also inhibits basal kinase activity by acting as a pseudosubstrate. Furthermore, it was suggested that ligand-promoted phosphorylation of activation loop tyrosines induces movement of the loop away from the catalytic core to permit efficient kinase activation. Although studies on activation loop tyrosines in several systems collectively suggest that they function to regulate RTK activation, the roles of individual tyrosines are unclear and are subject to some inconsistency within the literature (29Ellis L.

For example, tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation in the insulin receptor at the residue equivalent to TRK Tyr-670 in one case was reported to have no effect onin vitro kinase activity (35Zhang B. Tavaré J.M. Ellis L. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 990-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in several other studies the same mutation was reported to reduce in vitrokinase activity by approximately 80% (39Wilden P.A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3358-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It also appears that there may be differences between the roles of each of the activation loop tyrosines in the various receptors (34Longati P. Bardelli A. Ponzetto C. Naldini L. Comoglio P.M. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 49-57PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wilden P.A. Siddle K. Haring E. Backer J.M. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol.

Moreover, past studies have indicated that mutation of individual activation loop tyrosines may selectively abolish some receptor-mediated biological responses while sparing others, although the mechanistic basis for these observations is unknown. In the present study, we have examined the activation loop tyrosines in the TRKA receptor with respect to their roles in regulating signaling and biological responses to NGF. To achieve this, we mutated the tyrosines singly and in all combinations and have stably expressed receptors containing these mutations in PC12nnr5 cells at various levels of expression. Our findings are consistent with a major role for tyrosines 670, 674, and 675, not only in regulating overall catalytic activity of the receptor but also in governing site-specific receptor autophosphorylation. TRKA mutants were constructed using single strand mutagenesis (Bio-Rad). Briefly, full-length TRKA was used to generate antisense template, and sense oligonucleotides were used to introduce the point mutations. For double and triple mutations, oligonucleotides spanning all mutated sites were used. In the multiple site mutation constructs, restriction site cassettes containing each zone mutation (e.g. Y490F, Y785F etc.) were shuttled between the autophosphorylation loop backbones and then sequenced for confirmation. The mutant TRKs were then cloned into the pLNCX5 retroviral expression vector using HindIII andXhoI. The resulting constructs were then transfected into Ψ2 cells (46Mann R. Mulligan R.C. Baltimore D. Cell. 1983; 33: 153-159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar), and cells resistant to G418 (500 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) were selected, and the total population of cells was propagated in G418 (200 μg/ml). Cellular supernatant from these cells was used to infect PC12nnr5 cells (described below). PC12 cells and PC12nnr5-derived mutants were grown on collagen-coated tissue culture plates in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor horse and 5% fetal bovine serum (both from JRH Biosciences), as described previously (7Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). Retroviral infections were carried out by adding 0.2–1 ml of virus-containing supernatant, recovered from packaging cell lines, to 50% confluent PC12nnr5 cell cultures (47Greene L.A. Cunningham M.E. Farinelli S.E. Park D.S. Culturing Nerve Cells.in: Banker G. Goslin K. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1997Google Scholar). Transfections (used in generating cell lines bearing combinations of Y490F, Y751F, and Y785F superposed on triple activation loop mutant background) were carried out by electroporation as described previously (47Greene L.A. Cunningham M.E. Farinelli S.E. Park D.S. Culturing Nerve Cells.in: Banker G. Goslin K. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1997Google Scholar). Infected/transfected cells were cultured for 1 week and then subjected to selection with G418 (Sigma) for 2 weeks. Surviving colonies were isolated and clonally expanded for characterization. Representative clones were chosen for biochemical assessment on the basis of level of receptor expression and similarity of cellular morphology with that of parental cells. Neuritogenesis was assessed in cultures grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 1% heat-inactivated horse serum, as described previously (7Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NGF-treated (100 ng/ml) and NGF-untreated cultures were scored for times up to 1 week by determining the presence or absence of neurites on cells chosen at random (n ≥300). Reported values represent the mean values of triplicate experiments conducted with each clonal line. Recombinant hNGF was a generous gift from Genetech Inc. NGF treatment of cultures for biochemical assessments was routinely conducted 1 day following exchange of the culture medium and was accomplished by addition of an aliquot of concentrated stock to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. After indicated treatment times, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, were lysed (10% glycerol, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μm ZnCl2, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin), and the lysates were clarified by ultracentrifugation after a 15-min incubation on ice, all as described previously (48Loeb D.M.

Immunoprecipitated samples were washed three times in TNTG (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl) and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose (48Loeb D.M. Tsao H. Cobb M.H. Greene L.A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1053-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Western blotting was conducted with the indicated antibodies using the protocol of Amersham Life Sciences, Inc., followed by visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). For quantification, data were scanned and analyzed using NIH Scion Image v1.55 software. Blots were reprobed with antibody after stripping in 2% SDS, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 62.5 mmTris, pH 6.8, and rocking at room temperature for ≥16 h. ERK tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by subjecting clarified lysates (150 μg of protein) to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. Anti-ERK C-16 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PI3′K activity and SNT tyrosine phosphorylation were assessed as described previously (49Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M.

Measurements of radiolabeled products in the PI3′K assay were made using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Cells treated with NGF for 0, 30, 60, and 120 min were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and total RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent (MRC). Purified RNA was quantified, and 20-μg samples were subjected to Northern blotting as described previously (14Loeb D.M. Stephens R.M. Copeland T. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol.

To study the biological importance of the tyrosine autophosphorylation sites in the activation loop of TRK, constructs of the human receptor were mutated from tyrosine to phenylalanine at residues 670, 674, and 675, both singly and in all combinations. These and wild type (WT) TRK were cloned into the pLNCX retrovirus vector (54Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar), and the resultant recombinant retroviruses (pLNC-TRKA and mutants) were used to infect the Trk-deficient PC12-derived cell line, PC12nnr5 (16Green S.H. Rydel R.E. Connolly J.L. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 830-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 52Loeb D.M. Greene L.A. J. Neorusci. 1993; 13: 2919-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After selection, approximately two dozen independent clonal lines were isolated and expanded for each receptor construct. Cell lines representative for a spectrum of WT and mutant TRK levels were chosen for each of the constructs on the basis of analyses carried out by receptor immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative immunoblotting with Trk antiserum (Table I). Expression in each line was compared with that of the PC12nnr5-T14 cell line that over-expresses wild type TRK at levels approximately 3–5-fold higher than PC12 cells (49Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 52Loeb D.M. Greene L.A. J. Neorusci. 1993; 13: 2919-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the mutant and wild type TRKs ranged from equal to that of PC12nnr5-T14 cells to 20–50-fold higher. These cell lines were then assessed for NGF-induced neuritogenesis. In general, neurite outgrowth in the cell lines bearing mutant TRKs reached maximal levels by 3–4 days of NGF exposure (data not shown), which is comparable with previous observations for PC12nnr5-T14 cells and other TRK over-expressing PC12-derived cell lines (15Stephens R.M.

The isolated C-terminal domain (residues 165–337) of the protein interacts with the recombination site and contains the four catalytic residues conserved in the integrase family. This domain represents a novel fold consisting principally of well-packed α helices, a surface β sheet, and an ordered 17-residue C-terminal tail. The conserved triad of basic residues and the active-site tyrosine are contributed by a single monomer and occupy fixed positions in a defined active-site cleft.

Membrane-bound forms of alpha, gamma, and epsilon, but not mu and delta, have highly conserved cytoplasmic tails. Mutant mice unable to express membrane gamma1 H chains or producing tailless gamma1 H chains failed to generate efficient IgG1 responses and IgG1 memory. H chain membrane expression after class switching is thus required for these functions, and class switching equips the B cell antigen receptor with a regulatory cytoplasmic tail that naïve B cells lack."

This ""giant"" piezoelectric response may open the way for a broad class of applications including use in ultralow-temperature scanning microscopies and in a magnetic field-insensitive thermometer.

The molecular mechanisms involved in gene regulation by IL-1β are poorly understood; however, the appearance of novel tyrosine phosphoproteins in IL-1β-treated cells suggests that IL-1β may function through tyrosine phosphoprotein intermediates. The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases are tyrosine phosphoproteins that could potentially mediate the effects of IL-1β. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation following IL-1β treatment may be dependent on redox changes since the IL-1β receptor is not a protein-tyrosine kinase and oxidation has been shown to induce tyrosine phosphorylation. In this report we demonstrate that conditioning human glomerular mesangial cells with IL-1β results in the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of two members of the MAP kinase family, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2) and p54 Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). This effect of IL-1β is abrogated by pretreating cells with the antioxidantsN-acetyl-l-cysteine or dithiothreitol. Furthermore, the effects of IL-1β on ERK and JNK activation are reproduced by treating mesangial cells with membrane-permeable oxidants. IL-1β and oxidants also cause phosphorylation and activation of the upstream ERK regulatory element MAP kinase kinase. Interestingly, IL-1β, but not exogenous oxidants, causes phosphorylation of the upstream JNK activator, JNK kinase. These data indicate that IL-1β activates ERK2 through an oxidation-dependent pathway. Exogenous oxidants and IL-1β activate JNK through different upstream mechanisms; however, antioxidant inhibition of JNK activation indicates that endogenous oxidants may play a role in IL-1β-induced JNK activation. Thus IL-1β may affect mesangial cell function by activating MAP kinases, which can then regulate gene transcription.

Invest. 1994; 93: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, IL-1β may be relevant to the pathogenesis of glomerular damage in vivo. Despite a growing understanding of the effects of IL-1β on the kidney, the intracellular mechanisms that mediate the actions of IL-1β are poorly characterized. It is known, however, that IL-1β treatment of mesangial cells up-regulates tyrosine kinase activity and causes tyrosine phosphorylation of several mesangial cell proteins (10Daphna-Iken D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: F831-F837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Rovin B.H. Tan L.C.

Therefore, IL-1β may activate gene transcription in human mesangial cells through the induction of tyrosine phosphoprotein intermediates. In considering potential tyrosine phosphoprotein mediators of IL-1β activity, MAP kinases are of particular interest for several reasons. These kinases require tyrosine phosphorylation for activity, are cytokine-inducible, and have been implicated in regulating gene transcription (21Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakai E. Dai T. Ruble E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R.

Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Furthermore, members of the ERK and JNK subgroups of the MAP kinase family have molecular masses similar in size (24Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) to the tyrosine phosphoproteins that are induced by IL-1β treatment of human mesangial cells (18Rovin B.H. Tan L.C. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Lovett D.H. Martin M. Bursten S. Szamel M. Gemsa D. Resch K. Kidney Int. 1988; 34: 26-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although IL-1β can induce protein tyrosine phosphorylation, its receptor is not a classic receptor tyrosine kinase (26Sims J.E. March C.J. Cosman D. Widmer M.B. MacDonald H.R. McMahan C.J. Grubin C.E. Wignall J.M. Jackson J.L. Call S.M. Friend D. Alpert A.R. Gillis S. Urdal D.L. Dower S.K. Science. 1988; 241: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). IL-1β-induced tyrosine phosphorylation may be explained by the observation that protein tyrosine phosphorylation can be modulated by intracellular redox potential. Increasing intracellular oxidation can directly enhance protein tyrosine phosphorylation (27Bauskin A.R. Alkalay I. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1991; 66: 685-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 28Nakamura K. Hori T. Sato N. Sugie K. Kawakami T. Yodoi J.

Blood. 1993; 82: 1212-1220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can also potentiate protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by other stimuli (30Zor U. Ferber E. Gergely P. Szucs K. Dombradi V. Goldman R. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Heffetz D. Zick Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10126-10132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytokines such as IL-1β have been reported to increase oxygen radical release by mesangial cells (32Radeke H.H. Meier B. Topley N. Floge J. Habermehl G.G. Resch K. Kidney Int. 1990; 37: 767-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This investigation was thus undertaken to determine whether IL-1β-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in human mesangial cells activates ERK and/or JNK and to establish the role of intracellular oxidation in this pathway. Human mesangial cells were cultured from kidneys not suitable for transplantation and characterized as we have previously described (8Rovin B.H. Yoshiumura T. Tan L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2148-2153PubMed Google Scholar). In this investigation, cells from four different donors were used between passages 5 and 10. Cells were grown to confluence in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Before conditioning, monolayers were washed to remove serum; all subsequent incubations were carried out in medium consisting of RPMI 1640 plus 0.25% bovine serum albumin. In these experiments, mesangial cells were treated with medium alone (control) or with 1.1 ng/ml human recombinant IL-1β (specific activity, 5 × 108 units/mg; Genzyme Corp., Cambridge, MA). This concentration of IL-1β was previously determined to cause a significant induction of tyrosine phosphoproteins in mesangial cells (18Rovin B.H. Tan L.C. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 1059-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The redox status of the cells was manipulated by treatment with the antioxidants DTT or NAC (Sigma) or the cell-permeable oxidizing agents diamide (33Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) or hydrogen peroxide (Sigma). In some experiments, mesangial cells were conditioned with PD 098059 (34Pang L. Sawada T.

All reagents were diluted in RPMI 1640 plus 0.25% bovine serum albumin to achieve the indicated concentrations. Tissue culture medium and cytokines were found to be virtually endotoxin free (<0.1 ng/ml) using the quantitative Limulusamebocyte lysate assay (M. A. Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD). Confluent mesangial cells grown in 100-mm plates were appropriately conditioned and, at specified times after treatment, lysed in buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μmleupeptin, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin. For immunoblotting, 50–100 μg of cell protein were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions unless otherwise indicated and then transferred to 0.45 μm nitrocellulose membranes (Hoefer Biotech, Inc., San Francisco, CA) using the electroblotting technique described by Kyhse-Andersen (36Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), mouse monoclonal anti-pan ERK, which recognizes the 42- and 44-kDa isoforms (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphorylated-ERK, which recognizes the tyrosine-phosphorylated 42- and 44-kDa ERK isoforms (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA), polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphorylated-SEK, which recognizes threonine-phosphorylated SEK1 (New England Biolabs), polyclonal rabbit anti-phosphorylated-MEK, which recognizes serine-phosphorylated MEK1/2 (New England Biolabs), and polyclonal rabbit anti-JNK, which is specific for the FLG epitope of JNK and thus recognizes the 46- and 54-kDa isoforms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Non-immune rabbit IgG or mouse isotype-specific IgG served as a control for the primary antibodies. Appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies were obtained from Zymed Laboratories, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). After incubation with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase, blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). ERK was immunoprecipitated from mesangial lysates (500 μg of protein) with 5 μg of the anti-pan ERK antibody, followed by protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitated material was run on a polyacrylamide gel, blotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody as described above. To determine whether IL-1β increased JNK tyrosine phosphorylation, 500 μg of protein from mesangial lysates were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-phosphotyrosine, followed by protein A-agarose. After electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions (to avoid interference with the detection of p54 JNK from IgG heavy chains), the immunoprecipitated material was blotted and probed with the anti-JNK antibody, as described above. ERK activity in mesangial cell lysates was measured as the ability of these lysates to phosphorylate MBP, a substrate for ERK (37Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of mesangial protein were incubated with 10 μl of a 2 mg/ml MBP solution in buffer containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm DTT (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). A solution containing inhibitors to protein kinase C, protein kinase A, and calmodulin-dependent kinase was added to reduce interference from other serine/threonine kinases (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.). The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) in buffer containing 75 mm MgCl2 and 500 μm ATP. After 10 min at 30 °C, an aliquot of the reaction mixture was removed and blotted onto phosphocellulose paper. The papers were washed several times in 0.75% phosphoric acid before counting in a scintillation counter. After accounting for nonspecific binding and binding of endogenous proteins that were phosphorylated, the results were expressed as pmol of phosphate incorporated into MBP/min/μg of mesangial cell protein. Mesangial cell proteins were harvested and JNK activity was assayed (as described by Cano et al. (38Cano E. Hazzalin C.A. Kardalinou E. Buckle R.S. Mahadevan L.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3599-3609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) after immunoprecipitation of JNK isoforms. Briefly, cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.3 m NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 18 μg/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation and normalization of the protein content, extracts were mixed with 1.0 μg of polyclonal anti-JNK antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The JNK·anti-JNK immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose for 1 h, washed several times in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 100 μmNa3VO4, and 25 mmβ-glycerophosphate), and resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of the fusion protein GST-c-Jun(1–79)(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 100 μm ATP, and 3–5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature and was terminated by the addition of SDS-loading buffer. Phosphorylated GST-c-Jun1–79 was resolved on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then autoradiographed. Data are presented as mean ± S. E. Multiple comparisons were examined for significant differences using ANOVA. Individual comparisons were subsequently made using the Bonferroni post-test. A p < 0.05 was considered significant. The addition of IL-1β to mesangial monolayers resulted in a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins. Two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 41.2 and 52.6 kDa (p41.2 and p52.6, respectively) were the dominant proteins phosphorylated after incubation with IL-1β (Fig. 1 A). Proteins of the same molecular mass were tyrosine-phosphorylated when mesangial cells were treated with diamide, which directly oxidizes intracellular thiols, or with the membrane-permeable reactive oxygen intermediate, hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 1 B). Because increasing intracellular oxidation mimicked the effects of IL-1β on protein tyrosine phosphorylation, we examined whether antioxidants could inhibit IL-1β-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.2, when mesangial cells were treated with the antioxidants NAC or DTT before incubation with IL-1β, the tyrosine phosphorylation of p41.2 and p52.6 was attenuated. Similarly, diamide-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p41.2 and p52.6 was blocked in NAC-treated cells (Fig. 2). These data demonstrate that oxidation stimulates protein tyrosine phosphorylation in human mesangial cells and suggest that IL-1β-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation may occur through an oxidation-dependent mechanism.Figure 2Induction of tyrosine phosphoproteins is attenuated in cells pretreated with antioxidants. Cells were untreated (C), treated with 1.1 ng/ml IL-1β for 30 min or 2 mm diamide (DIA) for 10 min, washed, and incubated in fresh medium for 20 min. In some experiments, the cells were pretreated with 20 mm NAC or 2 mm DTT for 30 min followed by IL-1β or diamide. Whole cell lysates were then immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine. The arrows indicate the positions of the 41.2- and 52.6-kDa tyrosine phosphoproteins. Results are representative of four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The p41.2 and p52.6 tyrosine phosphoproteins have molecular masses similar to those reported for the MAP kinases ERK2 and p54 JNK, respectively (24Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Pelech S.L. Sanghera J.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 233-238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the predominant isoforms of ERK and JNK expressed in human mesangial cells were found to have molecular masses of 42.1 and 52.8 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3). These data suggested the possibility that IL-1β treatment of mesangial cells results in oxidation-dependent phosphorylation and activation of ERK2 and p54 JNK. This was tested in the following series of experiments. To determine whether IL-1β induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2, whole cell lysates were probed with an antibody specific for tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK. As shown in Fig. 4 A, this antibody detected tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK in lysates from IL-1β-treated mesangial cells but not from control cells. In most experiments, a single 41.6-kDa isoform of tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK was detected. Occasionally a minor band with an apparent molecular mass of 44.2 kDa (probably ERK1) was also seen. These results were confirmed by immunoprecipitating ERK from IL-1β-treated mesangial lysates and staining the immunoprecipitates with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. This demonstrated a tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK isoform with an apparent molecular mass of 41.1 kDa (data not shown). The role of redox status in ERK2 induction by IL-1β was evaluated by incubating cells with NAC or DTT before IL-1β. These antioxidants blocked IL-1β-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, the oxidizing agents diamide and hydrogen peroxide reproduced the effects of IL-1β and caused tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK2 (Fig. 4 B). This pattern of ERK phosphorylation in response to IL-1β, oxidants, or antioxidants was identical to the pattern of induction of the p41.2 tyrosine phosphoprotein (Fig. 1). We considered tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK to be an index of enzyme activation. To verify that IL-1β treatment of mesangial cells resulted in a functional increase in ERK activity, cell lysates were tested in a MBP phosphorylation assay. As shown in TableI, lysates from IL-1β-treated mesangial cells caused a significantly greater phosphorylation of MBP than lysates from untreated cells. Diamide and hydrogen peroxide increased MBP kinase activity similar to IL-1β (Table I). Pretreatment with 2 mm DTT for 30 min completely blocked IL-1β-induced MBP kinase activity (1.5 ± 0.3 versus 3.8 ± 0.9 pmol of phosphate incorporated/min/μg of protein; activity from the control cells was 1.5 ± 0.3, n = 4). Similarly, MBP kinase activity from cells treated with 20 mm NAC for 30 min followed by IL-1β (2.9 ± 0.5 pmol of phosphate incorporated/min/μg of protein, n = 6) was not different from control cell activity (2.2 ± 0.4,n = 5) but was significantly less than the activity from cells treated with IL-1β alone (4.98 ± 0.4,n = 5).Table IERK activity in human mesangial cellsConditionControlIL-1DiamideH2O2n111047Activity1.8 ± 0.23.9 ± 0.5ap < 0.01 versus control.5.0 ± 0.6ap < 0.01 versus control.3.5 ± 0.6bp < 0.05 versus control.Cells were treated as follows before lysis: control, medium alone; IL-1, 1.1 ng/ml for 30 min; diamide, 2 mm for 10 min then fresh medium for 20 min; H2O2, 150 μm for 30 min.

ERK activity is measured as pmol of phosphate incorporated into MBP/min/μg of cell protein. Taken together, these data conclusively demonstrate that IL-1β and oxidizing agents activate ERK2 in human mesangial cells. ERK activation in response to IL-1β or oxidants has been reported for other cell types (23Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 37Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol.

Commun. 1996; 218: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), consistent with the data presented here. A link between IL-1β and oxidant-induced ERK activation has not, however, been established previously. The observation that IL-1β-induced ERK2 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation are inhibitable by antioxidants provides evidence that reactive oxygen intermediates act as intracellular signals for IL-1β. To determine if IL-1β caused tyrosine phosphorylation of JNK, tyrosine phosphoproteins were immunoprecipitated from mesangial lysates and probed with anti-JNK antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, a single isoform of tyrosine-phosphorylated JNK (molecular mass 56 kDa, nonreducing conditions) was detected in immunoprecipitates from IL-1β-treated cells. Phosphorylated JNK was not found in control lysates. Subsequent experiments were undertaken to assess the role of oxidation in IL-1β-induced JNK activation. JNK was immunoprecipitated from mesangial lysates, and these immunoprecipitates were used to phosphorylate the fusion protein GST-c-Jun, a JNK substrate. Minimal c-Jun phosphorylation was detected using control cell immunoprecipitates, but immunoprecipitates from IL-1β-treated cells caused significant c-Jun phosphorylation (Fig.6 A). Diamide and hydrogen peroxide also induced c-Jun kinase activity (Fig. 6 B). Immunoprecipitates from cells exposed to DTT or NAC before IL-1β showed significantly decreased c-Jun kinase activity compared with cells incubated with IL-1β alone (Fig. 6 A). These data clearly demonstrate that IL-1β and oxidizing agents activate JNK in human mesangial cells. IL-1β and oxidant activation of JNK has also been described in other cells (24Kyriakis J.M. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 303-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42Guan Z. Tetsuka T. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Am. J.

The observation that IL-1β-induced JNK activity can be attenuated by antioxidants provides evidence that reactive oxygen species may mediate the effects of IL-1β on JNK activation in human mesangial cells. This conclusion is supported by a recent study that showed antioxidant inhibition of IL-1β-induced JNK activation in bovine chondrocytes (43Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The activation of ERK is dependent on an upstream Tyr/Thr kinase designated as MEK (45Cobb M. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). In order for MEK to phosphorylate and activate ERK, MEK must itself be serine-phosphorylated (46Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 47Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This portion of the ERK activation cascade was analyzed by immunoblotting mesangial lysates with an antibody specific for serine-phosphorylated (and presumably activated) MEK. As shown in Fig. 7, IL-1β, hydrogen peroxide, and diamide each induced MEK phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of MEK correlated with its activation because PD 098059, a specific inhibitor of MEK activation (35Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar), prevented IL-1β- and oxidant-induced ERK tyrosine phosphorylation (data not shown). This is consistent with a recent study that showed oxidant induction of ERK was mediated in part through MEK activation (40Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31234-31242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data support the conclusion that IL-1β activates ERK through an oxidation-dependent pathway. Furthermore, the results show that an IL-1β-induced redox signal acts upstream of ERK tyrosine phosphorylation, at least at the level of MEK activation, if not earlier in the cascade. These data also suggest that redox signals may regulate phosphorylation events other than protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Like ERK, JNK phosphorylation and activation are dependent on an upstream Tyr/Thr kinase. One potential upstream JNK kinase is SEK1, which itself must be serine/threonine-phosphorylated for activity (48Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J.

Science. 1995; 268: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting mesangial lysates for the threonine-phosphorylated form of SEK1 demonstrated phosphorylated SEK1 in lysates of IL-1β-treated cells but not in control cells (Fig. 7). In contrast, hydrogen peroxide and diamide did not induce phosphorylation of SEK1 (Fig. 7). This suggests that IL-1β and exogenous oxidants activate JNK by different mechanisms. A similar discrepancy was seen in neutrophils in which exogenous oxidants activated MAP kinase, but endogenously derived oxidants did not mediate MAP kinase activation byN-formyl-methionyl-leucyl phenylalanine (40Fialkow L. Chan C.K. Rotin D. Grinstein S. Downey G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31234-31242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although exogenous oxidants may conceivably activate JNK directly, a recent report suggests that hydrogen peroxide could not directly activate JNKin vitro (43Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Alternatively, exogenous oxidants may act through a different upstream regulatory element than SEK1 (50Meier R. Rouse J. Cuenda A. Nebreda A.R. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 796-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The observation that exogenous oxidants do not mimic the ability of IL-1β to phosphorylate (and presumably activate) SEK1 challenges the idea of a redox signal mediating IL-1β-induced JNK activation. This, however, is difficult to reconcile with the antioxidant inhibition of IL-1β-induced JNK activation (this study and Ref. 43Lo Y.Y.C. Wong J.M.S. Cruz T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15703-15707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). A potential explanation of these results is that in contrast to exogenous oxidants, endogenously derived reactive oxygen species generated during IL-1β treatment do contribute to the activation of SEK1. This scenario is supported by the observation that IL-1β-induced SEK1 phosphorylation was prevented in mesangial cells pretreated with DTT (data not shown). In summary, this report demonstrates that IL-1β and exogenous oxidizing agents activate ERK2 in human glomerular mesangial cells. For both IL-1β and oxidants, activation of ERK2 proceeds through MEK. These data, along with the finding that IL-1β-induced ERK2 activation is attenuated by antioxidants, provide strong evidence that IL-1β activates ERK through an oxidation-dependent pathway. IL-1β and exogenous oxidizing agents also activate p54 JNK but appear to signal through different upstream pathways. Exogenous oxidants act independently of SEK1, whereas IL-1β treatment results in SEK1 phosphorylation and presumably activation. Thus, IL-1β may activate JNK through an oxygen radical independent pathway. Alternatively, since antioxidants block JNK activation and SEK1 phosphorylation in response to IL-1β, endogenously derived oxygen radicals may serve as signal transduction elements for IL-1β in the JNK cascade. The implications of these results for human renal disease remain to be elucidated, but the data clearly suggest that at the molecular level MAP kinases may mediate the effects of IL-1β on glomerular cells. Additionally, this report illustrates a potential mechanism through which exogenous oxygen radicals, released during glomerular inflammation, can influence renal cellular function. Finally, the fact that endogenous reactive oxygen species may act as second messengers in the MAP kinase activation pathway identifies a potential target for therapeutic intervention in glomerular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1968947906,"We have characterized signaling pathways involving the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK, also known as PYK2 or CAK-β) in CMK human megakaryocytic cells. Stem cell factor, which potentiates the growth of megakaryocytes and their progenitors, and phorbol myristate acetate, which causes differentiation of megakaryocytic cell lines, induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK but not of focal adhesion kinase. Stimulation of CMK cells with stem cell factor resulted in an increase in the autophosphorylation and kinase activity of RAFTK. Phosphorylation of RAFTK under these conditions was mediated by a protein kinase C-dependent pathway. Cytochalasin D, which disrupts the cytoskeleton, abolished the phosphorylation of RAFTK upon phorbol myristate acetate and stem cell factor stimulation, indicating that RAFTK association with the actin cytoskeleton appears to be critical for its phosphorylation. In addition, we observed an association of RAFTK with paxillin, a 68-kDa cytoskeleton protein. Using <i>in vitro</i> binding assays, RAFTK and paxillin were shown to bind directly through the C-terminal proline-rich domain. Transient overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of RAFTK inhibited significantly the tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin upon phorbol myristate acetate stimulation. These observations indicate that RAFTK might play an important role in the phosphorylation of signaling pathways within the focal adhesions and that RAFTK participates in signaling events that link signals from the cell surface to the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, this study suggests that RAFTK might be involved in megakaryocyte proliferation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2074001058,"In response to K+ availability or medium osmolality, the sensor kinase KdpD and the response regulator KdpE control the expression of the kdpFABC operon, coding for the high affinity K+-translocating Kdp ATPase ofEscherichia coli. The stimulus for KdpD to undergo autophosphorylation is believed to be a change in turgor or some effect thereof, reflecting the role of K+ as an important cytoplasmic osmotic solute. The membrane-bound sensor kinase KdpD was overproduced as a fusion protein containing six contiguous histidine residues two amino acids before the C terminus.

Furthermore, KdpD-His6 was found to be the only protein that mediates dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P. Kdp is one of several transport systems that accumulate K+ in bacteria. Among these systems, Kdp has the highest affinity for K+, and it is only expressed when other systems are unable to meet the cells' need for K+. Expression of the kdpFABC operon, coding for the K+-translocating Kdp ATPase, is regulated by two proteins (KdpD and KdpE) that belong to the class of sensor kinase/response regulator systems (see Refs. 1Altendorf K. Epstein W. Lee A.G. Biomembranes.5. Jai Press, Inc., London, England1996: 403-420Google Scholar and 2Altendorf K. Voelkner P. Puppe W. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar for review). The kdpDgene has been cloned, sequenced, and overexpressed (3Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gene product KdpD is a membrane-bound protein located in the cytoplasmic membrane (3Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). According to hydropathy analysis of the primary amino acid sequence, KdpD consists of an extended cytoplasmic N-terminal region, four putative transmembrane domains, and an extended cytoplasmic C-terminal region (see Fig. 1). This model is strongly supported by the analysis of a series of KdpD-alkaline phosphatase (kdpD-phoA) and KdpD-β-galactosidase (kdpD-lacZ) fusions as well as protease susceptibility studies (5Zimmann P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28282-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of KdpD is readily demonstrated in vitro by crude cell extracts (4Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Momoi H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1777-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and by partially purified protein after reconstitution (7Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation proceeds most readily in the presence of Mg2+ and at a lower rate in the presence of Ca2+ (6Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Momoi H. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1777-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). There is moderate homology of parts of the C-terminal domain to other sensor kinases, including His-673. When His-673 was replaced by glutamine, phosphorylation was no longer observed. This finding supports the view that the site of phosphorylation is His-673 (4Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Addition of the soluble response regulator KdpE to phosphorylated KdpD results in rapid transfer of the phosphoryl group to KdpE (4Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Momoi H. Mizuno T. Mol.

Furthermore, purified KdpE∼P can be dephosphorylated in the presence of everted membrane vesicles containing KdpD (8Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Analysis of a set of KdpD proteins carrying different truncations in the N-terminal part of the protein indicated that in vitro autophosphorylation is dependent on the membrane-spanning domains and that in vivo signal transduction is modulated by the N-terminal region of KdpD (8Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). KdpD presumably functions as a turgor sensor. The turgor control model is based on the pattern of expression of kdpFABC in response to changes in medium K+ concentration and osmolality (9Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Altendorf K. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3216-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar,10Epstein W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 193-199Google Scholar), reflecting the role of K+ as an important cytoplasmic osmotic solute (11Epstein W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 39: 73-78Crossref Google Scholar). However, further observations lend support to the notion that turgor is apparently not the sole regulatory signal for the expression of kdpFABC and that the availability or intracellular concentration of K+ may also be involved (12Csonka L.N. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1991; 45: 569-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar, 13Asha H. Gowrishankar J. J.

To address the question of the stimulus for KdpD under in vitro conditions and to characterize this protein biochemically, it is necessary to develop an efficient and rapid purification and reconstitution method for KdpD. This report describes the purification of KdpD to >99% homogeneity and an efficient reconstitution method.

All other materials were reagent grade and obtained from commercial sources. E. coli JM109 (recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi hsdR17 supE44 λ − relA1 Δ(lac-proAB)/F′traD36 proA + B + lacIqlacZΔM15) (15Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11458) Google Scholar) was used as carrier for the plasmids described. E. coli TKR2000 (ΔkdpFABCDE thi rha lacZ nagA trkA405 trkD1 atp706) (16Kollmann R. Altendorf K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1143: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was used for expression of kdpD from the tac promoter. E. coliHAK006 (ΔkdpABCD Δ(lac-pro) ara thi) carries a kdpFABC promoter-lacZ fusion gene and is kdpE + (17Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Kanamaru K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This strain was used for determination of in vivo signal transduction. Plasmid pPV5 was used in which kdpD is under the control of thetac promoter (3Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate mutant construction, a unique restriction site (HindIII) after the stop codon of kdpD was created by polymerase chain reaction using plasmid pPV5. Six codons for His were introduced at position 2676 of the kdpD gene by polymerase chain reaction using the mutagenic antisense primer 5′-AA-TCA-GAA-GCT-TTG-TCA-CAT-ATC-ATG-ATG-ATG-ATG-ATG-ATG-CTC-ATG-AAA-TTC-3′ and a sense primer upstream of the ClaI restriction site. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified on agarose gel, digested with ClaI and HindIII, and ligated to similarly treated pPV5, resulting in pPV5-His6. Mutations were verified by sequencing the length of the polymerase chain reaction-generated segment through the ligation junctions in double-stranded plasmid DNA using the dideoxynucleotide termination method (18Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar) and synthetic sequencing primers after alkaline denaturation (19Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). E. coliTKR2000 cells transformed with plasmid pPV5-His6 were grown aerobically at 37 °C in KML complex medium (1% Tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% KCl) (20Epstein W. Davies M. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 836-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were harvested at an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼1.0. Everted membrane vesicles were prepared by passage of cells through a Ribi press and washed twice in an EDTA-containing buffer of low ionic strength (21Siebers A. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 178: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), except that the buffer was changed from Hepes/Tris to Tris/HCl. The washed membrane vesicles were homogenized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol; adjusted to 10 mg/ml protein; and stored until use at −80 °C. To an aliquot (typically 8 ml) of the washed membrane vesicles (5 mg/ml) was added 0.6 m NaCl, and while stirring on ice, KdpD-His6 was extracted with lauryldimethylamine oxide (LDAO) that was added stepwise until a final concentration of 2% (v/v) was reached. After stirring on ice for 30 min, this solubilization mixture was centrifuged for 45 min at 264,000 × g in a Beckman TL100 centrifuge. The supernatant fraction containing solubilized KdpD-His6 was purified by affinity chromatography on a 2-ml column of Ni2+-NTA resin in the following manner. The resin was pre-equilibrated with 25 bed volumes of column buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, and 0.04% (w/v) n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DM)). Binding of KdpD-His6 was carried out batchwise by incubation of the solubilized proteins and the Ni2+-NTA resin for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein-resin complex was then packed into the column, and unbound protein was removed by washing with column buffer until the absorbance at 280 nm returned to base line. Bound KdpD-His6 was eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration to 100 mm. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and 2-ml fractions were collected. KdpD-containing fractions were pooled and desalted by passage through a HiTrap desalting column. Final purification of KdpD-His6 was achieved by loading the desalted protein on a 4-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% (w/v) DM. Contaminating proteins were removed by increasing the NaCl concentration stepwise (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 300 mm). KdpD-His6 was eluted at 600 mm NaCl. KdpD-His6-containing fractions were pooled and used for reconstitution. Purified KdpD-His6 was reconstituted into E. coliphospholipids essentially as described (22Rigaud J.-L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Liposomes were solubilized with the indicated detergents, preferentially DM. The process of liposome solubilization was analyzed by turbidity measurements. In a typical experiment, E. coli phospholipids (5 mg/ml) were solubilized with DM (0.58%, w/v). Then KdpD-His6 in elution buffer was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 10 min. The final ratio of phospholipids to protein was kept at 25 (w/w). Bio-Beads were used to remove the detergent. Bio-Beads were thoroughly rinsed with methanol and buffer (23Holloway P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) and stored in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, and 10% glycerol at 4 °C until use. To remove the detergents, Bio-Beads at a bead/detergent ratio of 5 (w/w) were added, and the mixture was kept under gentle stirring at 4 °C. After incubation overnight, additional Bio-Beads were added to remove residual detergent. After further incubation for 3 h, the Bio-Beads were pipetted off. The turbid suspension was centrifuged for 1 h at 372,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Proteoliposomes were either used instantly or stored in liquid nitrogen. Everted membrane vesicles containing KdpD (2 mg/ml protein), solubilized KdpD (2 mg/ml), or proteoliposomes (0.13 mg/ml) were incubated in phosphorylation buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at room temperature. Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.38 Ci/mmol) or 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP (23.8 Ci/mmol) as indicated. At different times, aliquots were removed and mixed with an equal volume of twice concentrated SDS sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). After incubation for 5 min, an equimolar amount of purified KdpE (16.5 μg/ml) (8Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was added to the KdpD-containing fractions, and the incubation was continued. Additional aliquots were removed at different times and mixed with SDS sample buffer as described above. To test dephosphorylation, purified KdpE was phosphorylated in the following manner. Wild-type KdpD (0.67 mg/ml) was incubated in phosphorylation buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2instead of MgCl2, and phosphorylation was initiated with 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP (23.8 Ci/mmol). After 10 min, purified KdpE (16.5 μg/ml) was added, and the incubation was continued for 5 min. KdpD-containing membrane vesicles were removed by two filtration steps. First, a membrane with a pore size of 0.22 μm was used, followed by a second filtration through a low protein-binding membrane that cuts off proteins with a M r of >30,000. ATP was removed by the addition of 20 mmMgCl2, 3.2 mm glucose, and 5.4 units of hexokinase. Dephosphorylation was initiated by the addition of KdpD-His6 in everted membrane vesicles (0.44 mg/ml) or proteoliposomes (0.09 mg/ml). At the times indicated, aliquots were removed, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer. All samples were immediately subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). Gels were dried, and phosphorylation of the proteins was detected by autoradiography with Eastman Kodak BIOMAX MR film for 14 h at room temperature. Binding of 2-azido-[α-32P]ATP was studied with everted membrane vesicles containing KdpD-His6 (1 mg/ml) or solubilized KdpD-His6 (1 mg/ml) in different detergents. The samples were preincubated in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 52 μm 2-azido-[α-32P]ATP (0.34 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 3 min. Cross-linking was achieved by irradiation of the sample with UV light at 302 nm for 2.5 min. The same experiment was repeated except that the samples were preincubated with an excess of ATP (10 mm) for 3 min before 2-azido-[α-32P]ATP was added. All samples were immediately subjected to SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried, and phosphorylation of the proteins was detected by autoradiography. For Western blot analysis, everted membrane vesicles or proteoliposomes were solubilized in an equal volume of twice concentrated SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electroblotted, and immunoblots were probed with polyclonal antibodies against KdpD as described (4Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Immunodetection was performed using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (4Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes (0.2 mg/ml) in the corresponding buffer were incubated with kallikrein (100 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C. At the indicated times, the reaction was stopped by the protease inhibitor leupeptin (1 μm), and the protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. In vivosignal transduction was probed with E. coli HAK006 transformed with the plasmids described. Cells were grown in TY medium (1% Tryptone and 0.5% yeast extract) (14Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.6m NaCl and KCl as indicated. The basal concentration of K+ in the medium was determined to be 6 mm by flame photometry. Cells were grown to the mid-logarithmic growth phase and harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. An aliquot of this suspension was used to determine the absorbance at 600 nm, and another aliquot was used for determination of β-galactosidase activity after the cells were permeabilized with toluene. β-Galactosidase activity was determined from at least three different experiments and is given in Miller units calculated as described (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The turbidity of the phospholipid vesicle suspension as a function of detergent concentration was measured at an absorbance of 600 nm with a Shimadzu spectrophotometer. Liposomes were suspended at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. The detergent concentration was raised in increments, and absorbance was continuously recorded until a steady-state level was reached. Protein was assayed by a modified version (26Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar) of the method of Lowry et al.(45Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) using 7.5, 9, 11, and 12.5% acrylamide gels. Silver staining was performed as described (27Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3739) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis was used to insert six consecutive triplets encoding histidine two triplets before the stop codon of kdpD (Fig.1). This insertion was verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing. The gene encoding the tagged sensor kinase was cloned in pPV5 and overexpressed under the control of the tac promoter in E. coli TKR2000. KdpD-His6 was detectable in everted membrane vesicles in amounts that are comparable to wild-type KdpD as judged from immunoblot analysis (data not shown). KdpD-His6 in everted membrane vesicles was able to undergo autophosphorylation in the presence of ATP. After the addition of the purified response regulator KdpE, a rapid transfer of the phosphoryl group from phosphorylated KdpD-His6 to KdpE occurred (data not shown). In addition, KdpD-His6 caused dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P in a time-dependent manner. Simultaneously with the decrease in the amount of KdpE∼P, an increase in the amount of phosphorylated KdpD-His6 was observed (data not shown). All activities tested with KdpD-His6 were indistinguishable from those of wild-type KdpD. Furthermore, the sensing and signal transduction capacity of KdpD-His6 in vivo was tested. For this purpose,E. coli HAK006 was used (14Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which lacks the functionalkdpFABC operon as well as kdpD on the chromosome, but contains the intact kdpE gene under the control of its own promoter. This strain carries a kdpFABCpromoter-lacZ fusion gene on the chromosome. Upon transformation of this strain with a plasmid carrying the intactkdpD gene, the inducible expression of thekdpFABC operon can be probed by measuring β-galactosidase activity. It has been found previously that the extent ofkdpFABC expression is dependent on the K+concentration and the osmolality of the medium (9Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Altendorf K. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3216-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). E. coliHAK006 cells were transformed with plasmid pPV5 or pPV5-His6 and grown in a medium containing 0.6m NaCl and only basal levels of K+. The steady-state β-galactosidase activity of these cells was high (110 units), indicating that KdpD as well as KdpD-His6 were able to respond to high osmolality. Moreover, β-galactosidase activity was reduced to basal levels (0.8 units) when the cells were cultivated in a medium of the same osmolality containing 40 mmK+, which was sufficient to repress expression ofkdpFABC. Thus, a significant difference between the activities of KdpD-His6 and wild-type KdpD was observed neither under in vivo nor under in vitroconditions. Efficient solubilization of the membrane-bound histidine kinase is one of the prerequisites for purification. To select a detergent meeting this criterion, everted membrane vesicles were incubated in the presence of different detergents at final concentrations exceeding their critical micelle concentrations. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the reaction mixture was centrifuged, and aliquots of the supernatant and the resuspended membrane pellet were analyzed by immunoblotting (data not shown). The zwitterionic detergents LDAO, Zwittergent 3-12, and Zwittergent 3-14 were found to be the most efficient detergents in solubilizing KdpD-His6. Furthermore, solubilization of KdpD-His6 could be increased to nearly 100% when the solubilization was carried out in the presence of NaCl. Nonionic detergents had limited solubilization efficiency. The efficiency increased with the length of the carbon chain: octyl glucoside < decyl maltoside < DM. Maximal solubilization with DM was ∼50%. When KdpD-His6 solubilized in LDAO, DM, or Zwittergent 3-12 was tested for autophosphorylation activity, no phosphorylation of the protein was detectable (data not shown). In addition to standard conditions, phosphorylation was also tested in the presence of different NaCl concentrations (0, 50, and 150 mm). The ATP concentration was also varied. However, no significant phosphorylation of KdpD-His6 was observed under any of the conditions tested (data not shown). Furthermore, the ability of solubilized KdpD-His6 to bind 2-azido-[α-32P]ATP was analyzed. As shown in Fig.2, KdpD-His6 solubilized in DM was able to bind 2-azido-ATP. As a comparison, binding of 2-azido-ATP to KdpD-His6 in everted membrane vesicles is shown. More important, 2-azido-ATP binding could not be observed when KdpD-His6 was solubilized in LDAO or Zwittergent 3-12 (data not shown). Since solubilization of KdpD-His6 from membranes was nearly 100% using the detergent LDAO in the presence of NaCl, this detergent was used for the purpose of purification. Taking into account that only DM-solubilized KdpD-His6 was able to bind 2-azido-ATP, the detergent was changed from LDAO to DM in the first column chromatography step. The protocol used for the purification of KdpD-His6 comprised two steps: purification by nickel chelate affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. Experiments were generally carried out starting from 40 mg of protein of everted membrane vesicles. Progress of the purification was judged by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.3). In a typical experiment, everted membrane vesicles were solubilized in the presence of 2% LDAO and 0.6 m NaCl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As judged by the protein content, solubilization with LDAO was not very selective. Thus, 90% of the membrane proteins were solubilized by this detergent. The highest degree of purification of KdpD-His6 was achieved by the nickel chelate chromatography. Binding of KdpD-His6 to the Ni2+-NTA resin was most effective when the solubilized proteins were incubated batchwise with pre-equilibrated resin for 30 min. Furthermore, selective binding of KdpD-His6 was greatly enhanced by the addition of low amounts of imidazole (10 mm) and relatively high amounts of NaCl (0.5m). When the absorbance at 280 nm of the elute returned to base line, bound KdpD-His6 was eluted with 100 mm imidazole. As demonstrated by silver staining (Fig. 3), the fraction eluted with 100 mm imidazole shows a major protein band at ∼98 kDa that corresponds to KdpD-His6 and some other minor bands. To remove the residual contaminating proteins, ion exchange chromatography was used as a last purification step. Before loading the protein on a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column, the ionic strength of the pooled Ni2+-NTA column fractions was lowered by passage through a HiTrap desalting column. KdpD-His6 was bound to the ion exchanger. By applying a stepwise gradient of NaCl, contaminating proteins were eluted, whereas KdpD-His6 still remained bound to the resin. Finally, KdpD-His6 could be eluted at a NaCl concentration of 0.6 m. The eluted protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and after silver staining, only one band was detectable (Fig. 3). This protein band was identified as KdpD by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). KdpD-His6 appeared as a single band; no dimer formation or even higher order aggregates were observed. Overall, starting from 10 g of cells (wet weight), 1.5 mg of purified KdpD-His6 was obtained. Fractions containing KdpD-His6 eluted with 0.6 m NaCl from the DEAE-Sepharose column were pooled, and the protein was reconstituted into E. coli phospholipids. Reconstitution was carried out using the detergent-mediated method as described (22Rigaud J.-L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Liposomes were solubilized with increasing concentrations of DM, and the process of liposome solubilization was followed by turbidity measurements. As described for other membrane proteins, the stage of solubilization of liposomes prior to the addition of solubilized protein results in proteoliposomes of different activity (22Rigaud J.-L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). For DM, two characteristic solubilization stages of the liposomes were tested: partial solubilization and total solubilization. Purified KdpD-His6in elution buffer was added to the solubilized liposomes, and the detergent was removed by the addition of Bio-Beads. Upon reconstitution of KdpD-His6 into proteoliposomes, autophosphorylation activity was recovered (Fig. 4 A). The highest phosphorylation activity was achieved with liposomes that were totally solubilized with DM, as shown in Fig. 4 A. Additional detergents were tested for their ability to mediate reconstitution of KdpD-His6. Thus, LDAO, Triton X-100, sodium cholate, and octyl glucoside were used, and different stages of liposome solubilization were tested. Although all prepared KdpD-His6-containing proteoliposomes exhibited autophosphorylation activity (data not shown), the highest activity was always observed with liposomes that were solubilized with DM. The efficiency of KdpD-His6 reconstitution was determined to be 35%. In addition to testing the autophosphorylation activity of purified KdpD-His6 in proteoliposomes, transfer of the phosphoryl group to purified KdpE was examined. Therefore, proteoliposomes were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, and after 5 min, an equimolar amount of purified response regulator KdpE was added. Subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl group to KdpE occurred (Fig. 4 A). To determine whether purified KdpD-His6 would regenerate KdpE from its phosphorylated form, KdpE∼P was incubated with KdpD-His6 in proteoliposomes. A time-dependent dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P was observed (Fig. 4 B). Dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P was accompanied by an increase in the amount of phosphorylated KdpD-His6 (Fig. 4 B). The accessibility of ATP to KdpD-His6 in proteoliposomes suggested already an inside-out orientation of this protein. To obtain additional evidence for this, the susceptibility to the protease kallikrein was tested. In both the N- and C-terminal regions of KdpD, but not in the central hydrophobic region, 10 potential cleavage sites for kallikrein can be found. Earlier studies revealed that treatment of spheroplasts with kallikrein did not affect the kinase at all, but after permeabilization of the spheroplasts, KdpD was degraded completely, indicating that the protease cleavage sites are accessible only from inside the cells (5Zimmann P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28282-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). When proteoliposomes were incubated with kallikrein, KdpD-His6 was completely degraded (Fig.5). This result provides strong evidence for the unidirectional inside-out orientation of KdpD-His6 in proteoliposomes. Most histidine kinase molecules in bacteria, including KdpD, are integral membrane proteins (28Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar, 29Swanson R.V. Bourret R.B. Simon M.I. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). To study their activity in vitro, it is therefore necessary to establish an efficient solubilization and purification protocol. In the case of KdpD, this was achieved by applying the histidine peptide fusion technique (30Ljungquist C. Breitholtz A. Brink-Nilsson H. Moks T. Uhlé M. Nilsson B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although the His tag is located in the C-terminal domain, which is most certainly responsible for the interaction with ATP and the cytoplasmic response regulator KdpE, no significant changes with respect to phosphorylation, phosphotransfer, or dephosphorylation in comparison to the wild type could be observed. In addition, sensing and signal transduction in vivo were not influenced by the insertion of six His residues in KdpD as shown by the pattern of expression of thekdpFABC promoter-lacZ fusion gene in E. coli HAK006. To our knowledge, there is, so far, no other example of a fusion at the C-terminal end of a sensor kinase. In contrast, different sensor kinases with modifications at the N terminus have been described. Thus, the soluble parts of the sensor kinases NarX and NarQ were fused at the N-terminal end with six His residues, and the purified proteins were active (31Schröder I. Wolin C.D. Cavicchioli R. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In NRII, the N-terminal domain was replaced by the maltose-binding protein. This protein still catalyzed autophosphorylation and transfer of the phosphoryl group to the response regulator (NRI), but it was unable to stimulate the dephosphorylation of NRI∼P (32Kamberov E.S. Atkinson M.R. Chandran P. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28294-28299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilization of KdpD-His6 in different detergents resulted in an inactive protein. This result is in agreement with earlier attempts to detect autophosphorylation activity of the solubilized protein (7Nakashima K. Sugiura A. Mizuno T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1993; 114: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Obviously, only the membrane-bound protein exhibits autophosphorylation activity. This assumption is further supported by the analysis of a number of truncated KdpD proteins (8Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Different truncations of the N-terminal part resulted in KdpD proteins that retain autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer activities in vitro. In contrast, phosphorylation could not be detected in those forms of KdpD in which the membrane-spanning segments were removed. It is important to note that these inactive truncated forms of KdpD could be labeled with 2-azido-[α-32P]ATP, indicating that binding of ATP to KdpD was not affected by removal of the hydrophobic domain. Our studies demonstrate that DM-solubilized KdpD-His6 also retains its ability to bind 2-azido-ATP. This observation revealed that binding of ATP is not dependent on the anchoring of the protein in the membrane. In contrast, 2-azido-ATP binding was not detectable when KdpD-His6 was solubilized in zwitterionic detergents. Obviously, DM stabilizes the structure of KdpD, an effect that was also observed for other membrane proteins (e.g. Ref. 33Wu J. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12166-12171Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of KdpD-His6 into proteoliposomes restores full activity of the sensor kinase. Therefore, KdpD-His6 in proteoliposomes was phosphorylated when incubated in the presence of ATP, and the phosphoryl group could be transferred to the soluble response regulator KdpE. That these activities of KdpD are dependent on a membranous environment is atypical for membrane-bound sensor kinases. Soluble truncated forms of the sensor kinases FixL (34Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), EnvZ (35Forst S.A. Delgado J. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6052-6056Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 36Roberts D.L. Bennett D.W. Forst S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8728-8733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NarX and NarQ (31Schröder I. Wolin C.D. Cavicchioli R. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are capable of undergoing autophosphorylation. The finding that anchoring of KdpD in the membrane is a prerequisite for an active conformation is in accordance with the current model for the regulation of kdpFABC expression (1Altendorf K. Epstein W. Lee A.G. Biomembranes.5. Jai Press, Inc., London, England1996: 403-420Google Scholar). When turgor (and hence, membrane stretch) is high, KdpD is inactive. When turgor is reduced, KdpD alters its conformation, and the kinase becomes active, resulting in the formation of KdpE∼P and thus expression ofkdpFABC. However, it is also conceivable that the key feature of regulation is the dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P. Purified and reconstituted KdpD-His6 is able to facilitate dephosphorylation of purified KdpE∼P. Thus, dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P is dependent only on the histidine kinase KdpD. Dephosphorylation of the response regulator has been well studied in other sensor kinase/response regulator systems and characterized by diverse mechanisms (37Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-Component Signal Transduction. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar). The sensor kinase EnvZ by itself is able to enhance the rate of dephosphorylation of phospho-OmpR (38Igo M.M. Ninfa A.J. Stock J.B. Silhavy T.J. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1725-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 39Aiba H. Nakasai F. Mizushima S. Mizuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14090-14094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of NRII, an auxiliary protein (PII) is involved (32Kamberov E.S. Atkinson M.R. Chandran P. Ninfa A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28294-28299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Keener J. Kustu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the chemotaxis system, dephosphorylation of CheY is mediated by a separate protein, CheZ (42Blat Y. Eisenbach M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and in the process of sporulation of Bacillus subtilis, different phosphatases have been identified (43Perego M. Hanstein C. Welsh K.M. Djavakhishvili T. Glaser P. Hoch J.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 1047-1055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P is accompanied by an increase in the amount of phosphorylated KdpD. Whether this is due to a reverse phosphotransfer of the phosphoryl group from KdpE to KdpD or to residual amounts of ATP is still under investigation. For the EnvZ/OmpR system, a reverse phosphotransfer of the phosphoryl group from OmpR to the autophosphorylation site of a kinase−/phosphatase+ mutant of EnvZ was recently reported (44Dutta R. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1424-1429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that the purified and reconstituted KdpD-His6 protein retains enzymatic activity. KdpD has an autokinase activity, and the phosphoryl group can be transferred to the response regulator KdpE. Finally, KdpD facilitates the dephosphorylation of purified KdpE∼P. This study provides the basis for further analyses of the structure and function of KdpD. In this context, the question of how KdpD senses changes in turgor is especially interesting. We thank Dr. T. Mizuno for providing E. coli strain HAK006 and M. Lucassen for providing purified response regulator KdpE."

In mammalian cells, MCM proteins are present in the nuclei in two different forms that can be differentiated by nonionic detergent extraction, one soluble and extractable and the other tightly associated with the nucleus, which is resistant to such extraction. The level of mammalian MCMs does not vary greatly during the cell cycle, but the nucleus-bound form gradually becomes dissociated from nuclear structures with progression through the S phase (21Kimura H.

It is now assumed that it is associated with prereplicative chromatin and released at the time of initiation of replication; the soluble form existing abundantly in G2 nuclei is considered inactive and no longer capable of binding to chromatin. Based on the finding that the nucleus-bound MCMs are liberated by nuclease treatment, they are thought to be linked to chromatin structures, but some controversy still remains in this regard (21Kimura H.

Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 604-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). On the other hand, yeast MCMs exhibit genetic interactions (4Yan H.

In mammalian cells, interactions among MCMs have been studied mainly using nonionic detergent-extractable fractions, where CDC46 and MCM3 assemble into a complex (21Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K.

Although such studies have provided useful information for understanding mammalian MCMs, it is very important that we analyze their nucleus-bound counterparts, whose biological and biochemical properties are presumably distinct. Indeed, the state of phosphorylation is known to be different between the two types, seemingly affecting nuclear association-dissociation (21Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 22Todorov I.T. Attaran A. Kearsey S.E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and perhaps also influencing protein-protein interactions. In the present study, we therefore investigated the properties of the nucleus-bound form of human MCM (hMCM) proteins. HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum. The buffer used for preparation of cell lysates and the immunoprecipitation procedure was modified CSK buffer (35Blencowe B.J. Nickerson J.A. Issner R. Penman S. Sharp P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 593-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.1 or 0.5% Triton X-100 (0.1%TX-100mCSK or 0.5%TX-100mCSK, respectively). ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP were purchased from Sigma; ATPγS and AMP-PNP were from Calbiochem. The preparation, purification, and specificity of rabbit anti-hCDC47 (human CDC47) antibodies were described previously (24Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol.

Kimura (Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan). Rabbit anti-Xenopus MCM2 (XMCM2) antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. S. Miyake (Toho University, Tokyo, Japan). All of these antibodies recognize not only the authentic target antigens but also their corresponding human homologues on Western blotting (21Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K.

Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Triton X-100-extracted nuclei were prepared as follows. Cells cultured in 100-mm plates were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 10 min on ice with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.5%TX-100mCSK. After low speed centrifugation (3000 rpm, 3 min at 4 °C), the nuclei were once more extracted with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.5%TX-100mCSK for 10 min on ice, recentrifuged, and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 0.5%TX-100mCSK. Aliquots (100 μl) were incubated at the indicated temperature for the indicated period. Nucleotides, EDTA, or MgCl2 were added to the samples before incubation as necessary. After incubation, the pellet fractions and the soluble supernatants were separated by low speed centrifugation. The pellet fractions were resuspended in 100 μl of the buffer, and the supernatants were clarified by centrifugation at 15000 rpm for 5 min. The samples were then added to the same volumes of 2 × SDS-sample buffer (1 × solution; 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue), boiled, and analyzed by Western blotting or SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Nuclease digestion of Triton X-100-extracted nuclei was performed as follows. Triton X-100-extracted nucleus suspensions were prepared as described above. If not stated otherwise, 1 mm ATP was added to the buffer throughout the procedure. For DNase I digestion, the samples (100 μl) were supplemented with 250 or 1000 units/ml DNase I (10 units/μl, RNase-free, Boehringer Mannheim), followed by incubation. For HaeIII digestion, the MgCl2concentration was increased to 2 mm, and the samples were incubated at 33 °C for 40 min with 1200 units/ml HaeIII (12 units/μl, Boehringer Mannheim). Subsequently, the pellet fractions and the soluble supernatants were separated by low speed centrifugation, and the samples were processed as described above. To examine the extent of chromatin solubilization by nuclease digestion, DNA was isolated from the pellet and soluble fractions as follows. Samples (100 μl) were supplemented with 20 mmEDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml RNase A and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Proteinase K (200 μg/ml) was then added, and incubation was continued for a further 2 h. After extraction with phenol-chloroform and precipitation with ethanol in the presence of 2.5m ammonium acetate, the pellets were dissolved in 80 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA. The amounts of DNA were then spectrophotometrically determined at a wavelength of 260 nm. Cell extracts were prepared as follows. For the Triton X-100-extractable fractions, cells cultured in 100-mm plates were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed for 20 min on ice with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1%TX-100mCSK with 1 mm ATP, and centrifuged. For the fractions released from nonionic detergent-extracted nuclei by heating in the absence of ATP, Triton X-100-extracted nuclei prepared from 100-mm culture plates as described above, except that 0.1%TX-100mCSK was used for second round of lysis, were incubated in 1 ml of 0.1%TX-100mCSK at 25 °C for 30 min and centrifuged to obtain the soluble supernatant. For the fractions released from Triton X-100-extracted nuclei by DNase I digestion (the DNase I-released fractions), Triton X-100-extracted nuclei prepared from 100-mm plates as described above, except that 0.1%TX-100mCSK with 1 mm ATP was used for second round of lysis, were digested with 1000 units/ml DNase I in 1 ml of 0.1%TX-100mCSK containing 1 mm ATP at 25 °C for 30 min and centrifuged to obtain the soluble supernatant. Separate aliquots were then mixed with 3 μg of purified anti-hCDC47 antibodies, anti-mMCM3 antibodies or control rabbit immunoglobulin, and rocked for 1 h at 4 °C. The mixtures were further incubated for 1 h after the addition of 10 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), and then the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of 0.1%TX-100mCSK with or without 500 mm NaCl for 10 min each. ATP (1 mm) was also included in the washing buffer for the Triton X-100-extractable fraction or the DNase I-released fraction. The immunoprecipitates were eluted with elution buffer (0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5) and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining or immunoblotting. The efficiency of precipitation averaged approximately 10% of the total for each protein. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (24Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The protein blots were incubated with appropriate first antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, purified anti-hCDC47 antibodies at 1 μg/ml, rabbit anti-mMCM3 antiserum at a 1:1000 dilution, rabbit anti-mcdc21 antiserum at a 1:500 dilution, rabbit anti-mCDC46 antiserum at a 1:500 dilution, rabbit anti-XMCM2 antiserum at a 1:500 dilution, and anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) mouse monoclonal antibody at 20 μg/ml (PC10, Boehringer Mannheim). The blots were then probed with peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed) and visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). The intensity of signals visualized on films was measured with a CS-930 chromatoscanner (Shimadzu, Japan). Purified plasmids carrying hCDC47 cDNA or hMCM3 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. H. Takisawa; Osaka University, Osaka, Japan) were expressed in a coupled transcription-translation system with [35S]cysteine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). In vitro translated proteins were diluted with 0.1%TX-100mCSK containing 1 mm ATP and subjected to immunoprecipitation with either anti-hCDC47 or anti-mMCM3 antibodies. After washing with the same buffer, the beads were boiled in 1 × SDS-sample buffer, and the precipitates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed with a bioimaging analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film, Japan). During the course of the present analyses, we found that the nucleus-bound hMCM proteins were released from the extracted nuclei by heating. Immunoblotting analysis of the levels of hCDC47 protein in the nuclear pellets and the soluble supernatants separated after incubating Triton X-100-extracted HeLa cell nuclei revealed that, by incubation at 25 °C for 40 min, about half of the nucleus-bound hCDC47 was liberated into the supernatant, and at 33 °C for 40 min, almost all was liberated (Fig. 1 A). With parallel immunoblotting using anti-mMCM3 antibodies, hMCM3 was also found to be dissociated with similar kinetics (Fig. 1 C). PCNA, the auxiliary protein of DNA polymerase δ (37Prelich G. Kostura M. Marshak D.R. Mathews M.B. Stillman B. Nature. 1987; 326: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), is also known to have a detergent extraction-resistant nucleus-bound form (38Bravo R. Macdonald-Bravo H. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1549-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), the levels of which are cell cycle-regulated during S phase but differently from hMCM proteins (24Fujita M. Kiyono T. Hayashi Y. Ishibashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the nucleus-bound PCNA was also found to be dissociated from the nuclei in a temperature-dependent manner. For all three proteins, neither detectable proteolytic products nor remarkable reduction in the total amount were found after heating. There are several possible reasons for the observed thermolability of the nuclear association of these proteins. Interestingly, for hMCM proteins, the addition of ATP to the reaction mixture inhibited their dissociation. In contrast to the control case, in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP, almost all hCDC47 protein was retained in the nuclear pellet even after incubation at 33 °C for 40 min (Fig.1 B). ATP-dependent retention was also observed for hMCM3 (Fig. 1 C) and hcdc21 (data not shown). In contrast, the addition of ATP failed to inhibit the thermolability of the PCNA nuclear association (Fig. 1 B), indicating that the effect of ATP is not nonspecific. In all of the cases described above, the core histones were detected only in the nuclear pellet fractions, irrespective of the incubation temperature or the presence of ATP (Fig.1 B). To examine the specificity of the ATP requirement for the nuclear association of hMCMs, the experiments were repeated in the presence of three other ribonucleoside triphosphates. As shown in Fig.2 A, none of them could maintain the association of hCDC47 as effectively as ATP. Similar results were also obtained for hMCM3 (data not shown). To address the role of ATP, two ATP analogs were tested for their ability to function in place of ATP. At comparable concentrations, both ATPγS and AMP-PNP, which has a nonhydrolyzable β–γ bond, could maintain the association of hCDC47 (Fig. 2 B) or hMCM3 (data not shown). This indicates that the hydrolysis of ATP β–γ bonds, required for protein phosphorylation or ATPase reaction, is not required for the observed ATP-dependent nuclear binding by hMCMs. DNA-protein interactions frequently require divalent cations, especially Mg2+. Accordingly, we examined the effects of Mg2+ on the nuclear association of hMCMs as follows. To avoid undesired nuclear lysis by removal of divalent cations, Triton X-100-extracted nuclei were prepared as usual with 0.5%TX-100mCSK buffer, which contains 1 mm MgCl2, and before incubation, they were supplemented with excess EDTA (final 10 mm) or additional MgCl2. In the presence of EDTA, almost all of the nucleus-bound hCDC47 was liberated from the nuclei by incubation at 25 °C for 20 min (Fig. 2 C). Increasing the concentration of MgCl2 inhibited the release (Fig. 2 C). In all cases, the core histones were detected only in the nuclear pellet fractions (data not shown); thus, the release of the hCDC47 in the presence of EDTA may not be due to nonspecific nuclear lysis. These findings suggest that Mg2+may play a role in the nuclear association of hMCMs. In the presence of ATP, however, EDTA did not appear to accelerate the dissociation; even after incubation at 33 °C for 40 min, almost all hCDC47 protein was retained in the nuclear pellet, irrespective of the presence or absence of EDTA (Fig. 2 D). It is possible that, in the presence of ATP, the association of Mg2+ with putative target molecule(s) is stabilized and thus not interfered with by EDTA. Alternatively, Mg2+ might not be required in the presence of ATP. These points should be precisely reexamined when a reconstituted system for hMCM-DNA (or chromatin) binding is established. Determination of conditions to stabilize the association of hMCMs with nucleus enabled us to more precisely examine whether they were released by nuclease digestion. The Triton X-100-extracted HeLa cell nuclei were incubated with 1 mm ATP at 25 °C for 30 min under the absence or presence of DNase I, and thereafter the levels of hCDC47 protein in the nuclear pellets and the soluble supernatants were examined by immunoblotting. Without DNase I, almost all of the nucleus-bound hCDC47 remained in the pellet. In contrast, when incubation was with 250 units/ml DNase I, approximately two-thirds of the nucleus-bound hCDC47 was released, and with 1000 units/ml, by which the genomic DNA was digested into less than 400–100 base pairs on average (data not shown), almost all was released (Fig. 3 A). Parallel immunoblotting revealed that the nucleus-bound hMCM3 and hcdc21 were also liberated by DNase I digestion like hCDC47 (Fig.3 A; data not shown for hcdc21). When nuclei were treated with restriction endonuclease HaeIII instead of DNase I, similar release of the nucleus-bound hCDC47 and hMCM3 resulted (Fig.3 B). In both cases, release of the hMCMs by nuclease digestion was accompanied by liberation of core histones (Fig. 3,A and B). We also examined whether the bound hMCMs are released by nuclease digestion even in the absence of ATP at low temperature. To facilitate the nuclear association of hMCMs in the absence of ATP and DNase I activity at low temperature, the MgCl2 concentration was increased to 10 mm in these experiments. Under such conditions, without DNase I, most of the bound hCDC47 remained in the pellet even after incubation in the absence of ATP at 4 °C for 60 min, but this was also released by the addition of 1000 units/ml DNase I (Fig. 3 C). Temperature-dependent release of hCDC47, its suppression by ATP, and DNase I-mediated release under the presence of ATP, were observed not only for HeLa cells, as described above, but also for untransformed WI38 human fibroblasts (data not shown). Together, these data lead us to conclude that the nucleus-bound hMCMs are associated with chromatin and that the binding is stabilized by ATP. It has been suggested that replication factories are connected with the nuclear matrix and that they are relatively resistant to removal by nuclease treatment. For example, newly synthesized DNA appears to remain associated with nuclei even after most chromosomal DNA is removed (28Hozák P. Hassan A.B. Jackson D.A. Cook P.R. Cell. 1993; 73: 361-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the time course of the DNase I-directed solubilization of the nucleus-bound hMCMs, comparing it with that of genomic DNA. The Triton X-100-extracted nuclei were digested with 1000 units/ml DNase I in the presence of ATP at 25 °C, and after 5, 10, and 20 min, respectively, the nuclear pellets and the soluble supernatants were separated and examined for hCDC47 and DNA levels. As shown in Fig. 3 D, the extent of release of the bound hCDC47 was almost proportional to that of chromosomal DNA throughout the time course. This was also the case forHaeIII digestion at 33 °C for 40 min (data not shown). Therefore, it seems unlikely that the bound hMCMs are more resistant to removal by nuclease digestion as compared with total chromatin. Although biochemical analyses of mammalian MCM proteins have so far been accomplished mainly using nonionic detergent extractable forms, several lines of investigation of chromatin-bound forms have been attempted with high concentration salt extraction. Using such methods, for example, it has been shown that MCM3 and CDC46 form a complex in the chromatin-bound form as tight as in the soluble one (21Kimura H. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4311-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 23Kimura H. Takizawa N. Nozaki N. Sugimoto K.

This salt extraction is useful in some instances but might be inappropriate for analyses of interactions among proteins, since only those strong enough to be resistant to high salt concentrations would be maintained. We consider that the above described DNase I-directed solubilization of chromatin-bound hMCMs in the presence of ATP was a viable alternative to salt extraction; it better preserves physical interactions among proteins or between proteins and DNA, although the effects of the DNA remaining after DNase I digestion should be taken into account in the interpretation of results. In the present study, as an initial trial, we focused on physical interactions among the chromatin-bound hMC"
https://openalex.org/W2054711697,"A key regulatory event controlling platelet activation is mediated through the phosphorylation of several cellular proteins by protein-tyrosine kinases. The related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK) is a novel cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and a member of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) gene family. FAK phosphorylation in platelets is integrin-dependent, occurs in a late stage of platelet activation, and is dependent on platelet aggregation. In this study, we have investigated the involvement of RAFTK phosphorylation during different stages of platelet activation. Treatment of platelets with thrombin induced, in as early as 10 s, a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of platelets with thrombin in the absence of stirring or pretreatment of platelets with RGDS peptide prevented platelet aggregation, but not RAFTK phosphorylation. Furthermore, phosphorylation of RAFTK did not require integrin engagement since platelets treated with the 7E3 inhibitory antibodies that block fibrinogen binding to glycoprotein IIb-IIIa did not inhibit RAFTK phosphorylation. Similarly, platelets treated with LIBS6 antibodies, which specifically activate glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, did not induce RAFTK phosphorylation. Stimulation of platelets by several agonists such as collagen, ADP, epinephrine, and calcium ionophore A23187 induced RAFTK phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation of RAFTK in platelets is regulated by calcium and is mediated through the protein kinase C pathway. Phosphorylation of RAFTK is dependent upon the formation of actin cytoskeleton as disruption of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D significantly inhibited this phosphorylation. The RAFTK protein appears to be proteolytically cleaved by calpain in an aggregation dependent manner upon thrombin stimulation. These results demonstrate that RAFTK is tyrosine-phosphorylated during an early phase of platelet activation by an integrin- independent mechanism and is not dependent on platelet aggregation, suggesting different mechanisms of regulation for FAK and RAFTK phosphorylation during platelet activation."
https://openalex.org/W2151707666,"Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) is one of the most potent inducer of the nuclear transcription factor κB (NF-κB).

Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar), participates in the regulation of several genes, most of them being involved in the early events of immune, acute phase, or inflammatory responses (for review, see Ref. 28Baeurle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). NF-κB is also responsible for the transcriptional activation of many viral genes, e.g. of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (29Nabel G. Baltimore D. Nature. 1987; 326: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Inactive NF-κB is a heterodimer consisting of a 50-kDa and a 65-kDa subunit retained in the cytoplasm by association with a 36-kDa inhibitory subunit IκB-α (30Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1988; 53: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar, 31Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 32Beg A.A.

Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), starting with serine phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of IκB-α (34Gosh S. Baltimore D.

Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). Recently it has been reported that different receptor domains of the TR55 activate the different sphingomyelinases (12Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Truncated TR55 mutants, which lack the so-called death domain, an 80-amino acid residue C-terminal sequence, neither showed NF-κB activation nor an increase of ASM activity, while the NSM activation was not affected when expressed in 70Z/3 cells, suggesting that activation of NF-κB is mediated exclusively by the acid sphingomyelinase (12Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 23Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Following these results activation of NF-κB by TNF-α should be precluded in ASM-deficient cells. In the present study we used primary embryonic fibroblasts (EMFIs) from the recently established ASM-deficient mouse line (8Otterbach B. Stoffel W. Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) (asmase −/− EMFIs) to elucidate the role of the acid sphingomyelinase in the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. In contrast to previous reports (12Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 23Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar), we found no moderation of the NF-κB activation pathway in the response to TNF-α in cells derived from asmase −/− mice in comparison with wild type mice. Neither changes in ASM or NSM activitiy nor alterations in sphingomyelin or ceramide concentration have been determined after TNF-α treatment. EMFIs (fourth to sixth passage) derived from wild type (C57/Bl6) and asmase −/−(C57/Bl6 × 129/01a asmase −/−) e 14 embryos were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Seromed) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-κB p65, rabbit polyclonal anti-NF-κB p50, and rabbit polyclonal anti-IκB-α antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. Alkaline phosphatase-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG second antibody, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, pepstatin A, and DTT were purchased from Sigma and [γ-32P]ATP and [α-32P]dATP from Amersham Corp. Recombinant human TNF-α (specific activity, 6.6 × 106 units/mg) was kindly provided by BASF/Knoll, Germany. EMFIs were grown in serum-free medium for 4 h prior to stimulation, and 100 ng/ml medium TNF-α was added for the indicated times. Stimulation was stopped by removing the medium and washing the cell layer with cold PBS. Proteins were fractionated as described previously (33Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, cells were scraped with a rubber policeman into fresh, cold PBS and washed twice. After low-speed centrifugation (200 × g) the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmbenzamidine) and placed for 10 min on ice. Nuclei were separated from the cytoplasm by centrifugation at 2500 rpm in a microcentrifuge (Eppendorf) at 4 °C for 5 min, washed briefly with lysis buffer without Nonidet P-40, resuspended in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol), and lysed by adding NaCl to a final concentration of 400 mm. The suspension was kept for 10 min on ice, vortexed, and centrifugated for 10 min (14.000 rpm). The supernatant contained the nuclear protein extract. The supernatant of the first centrifugation step, which contained the cytoplasmic fraction, was centrifugated at 14,000 rpm and the resulting supernatant used for Western blot analysis. 50 μg of protein of cytoplasmic extract was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) for 3 h with 1 mA/cm2. The membrane was blocked for 2 h with 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline and incubated overnight at 4 °C with 300 ng of anti-IκB-α polyclonal antibody/ml of Tris-buffered saline, 1% BSA. After incubation with the second antibody for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline, 1% BSA, the bands were stained using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma) and nitro blue tetrazolium (Boehringer Mannheim). 5–10 μg of nuclear proteins (determined by the BCA assay (Pierce)) were incubated with 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.4 pmol of double-stranded32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB binding site of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat (5′-ATCAGGGACTTTCGCTGGGGACTTTCCG-3′) in a total volume of 20 μl in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 2 mmMgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol. After 30 min at room temperature samples were separated on native 4% polyacrylamide gels using 0.25 × TBE (0.0225 m Tris borate, 0.0005m EDTA, pH 8.0) as running buffer. Competition studies were carried out with two unrelated double-stranded oligonucleotides A (5′-ATCAAGATATGAAAGAGTCTGAACATAGCACCA-3′) and B (5′-GTCTTATTCACTGCTAGCAACCATGGGCTGAAG-3′). For supershift analysis the NF-κB-double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide complexes were further exposed to a polyclonal antibody recognizing the p50 subunit of NF-κB. Gels were dried, and radioactive signals were analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). EMFIs from wild type andasmase −/− mice were grown in serum-free medium for 4 h and stimulated for 20 min with 100 ng/ml TNF-α. After discarding the medium, cells were fixed with a mixture of acetone/methanol (1:1) and incubated with anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (300 ng/ml in PBS, 3% BSA) for 1 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100, incubated with a Cy3-coupled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 1 h and after further washings analyzed under a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). 40 μg of total RNA prepared by the guanidine thiocyanate-phenol method (38Chomczynski P. Sacci N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar) was separated on a 2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto a GeneScreen Plus nylon-membrane (DuPont) following the manufacturer's protocol. The blot was probed with a 125-bp fragment derived from the 5′ end of the IκB-α cDNA sequence and a 348-bp fragment derived from the β-actin cDNA. For first strand cDNA synthesis RNA was transcribed in a reverse transcriptase reaction. The reaction mixture contained in a total volume of 10 μl: 0.5 mm of each deoxynucleotide (Boehringer Mannheim), 5 μm random hexanucleotide primers (Boehringer Mannheim), 10 mm DTT (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega), 100 units of Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 ng of total RNA in a reverse transcriptase buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. One-half of the RT reaction mixture was used for the PCR reaction with the primers mIκB-s (5′-GCCCCGCACAGCCATGTTTCAG-3′) and mIκB-as (5′-CATGGAGTCCAGGCCGCTGTCGTG-3′) for IκB-α. The other half was used for the β-actin control with the oligonucleotides mβ-actin-s (5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAA-3′) and mβ-actin-as (5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTC-3′). Fragments were amplified in a thermal cycler (Perkin-Elmer) with the following program: 5 min 94 °C (1 ×); 45 s 94 °C, 60 s 60 °C, 90 s 72 °C (25 ×); 10 min 72 °C (1 ×). PCR products were separated on a 2% TBE-agarose gel and analyzed under UV light. EMFIs were incubated with 100 ng/ml TNF-α, and ASM activities were measured following a modified method described previously (39Quintern L.E. Sandhoff K. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 197: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, 4 × 106 cells were grown in serum-free medium for 4 h and incubated with TNF-α for 2 and 4 min, respectively (12Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The medium was discarded, cells were scraped into cold PBS, washed once, resuspended in 200 μl of 0.2% Triton X-100, and placed on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min, 10 μg of protein of the supernatant was diluted to a final volume of 90 μl with buffer (250 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 1 mm EDTA). 10 μl of substrate (1 nmol of [N-14CH3]sphingomyelin/μl of buffer (specific activity, 8000 dpm/nmol) (40Stoffel W. LeKim D. Tschung T. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1971; 352: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar)) was added and the mixture incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. For detection of NSM activity (12Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 41Schütze S. Krönke M. Balkwill F.R. Cytokines: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, 1995: 93-109Google Scholar), cells were stimulated with TNF-α for 1 and 2 min, transferred into cold PBS, washed, resuspended in 200 μl of buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm pepstatin A, 750 μm ATP, 0.2% Triton X-100), and placed for 10 min on ice. Conditions of incubation and enzyme assay were as described for ASM except that 10 μg of protein was resolved in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, and incubation time was extended to 120 min. [14C]Phosphorylcholine was extracted by adding 200 μl of H2O and 800 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1) mixture, and the radioactivity of the aqueous phase was determined by scintillation counting. Fibroblasts were metabolically labeled with [1-14C]palmitic acid (specific activity, 0.81 × 107 dpm/mg, 20 μg/ml culture medium) for 36 h. Before TNF-α stimulation the medium was removed, and cells were grown in serum-free medium for 4 h. Stimulation of cells was stopped by removing the medium and immediate washing with cold PBS. Cells were scraped from the culture dishes, centrifugated, and the cell pellet suspended in chloroform/methanol (2:1) for lipid extraction. Phases were separated by centrifugation for 10 min at 4000 × g. The organic phase was dried under nitrogen, and lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1). Radioactive lipids were measured in a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac 1409), and aliquots were separated on TLC plates (Merck) in chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4). Radioactivity was detected and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using internal standards. We studied the role of sphingomyelin and ASM within the postulated signal transduction chain initiated by TNF-α and leading to the NF-κB activation in EMFIs derived from wild type andasmase −/− mice. The genotype ofasmase −/− EMFIs was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization analysis of the EcoRI-restricted DNA using the previously described probe (8Otterbach B. Stoffel W. Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In addition the ASM activity of wild type and the null mutant fibroblasts was assayed using [N-14CH3]sphingomyelin as substrate. The asmase −/− fibroblasts showed no ASM activity. Southern blot analysis and enzyme assay therefore clearly proved the complete ASM deficiency of the mutant EMFIs. TNF-α rapidly activates NF-κB (28Baeurle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar) and leads to degradation of IκB-α (33Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Krönke M. Ben-Neria Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar), which is rapidly resynthesized. We studied first the kinetics of IκB-α degradation of wild type andasmase −/− EMFIs after TNF-α stimulation over the time period indicated in Fig. 1. Western blot hybridization analysis showed the disappearance of the IκB-α signal within 10–20 min identically in cells with both genotypes. Resynthesis restored the IκB-α level within 60 min to the level of the unstimulated cells. IκB-α was recognized by the polyclonal antibody as a 36-kDa protein. We also monitored the NF-κB-induced resynthesis of IκB-α following its degradation (28Baeurle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 42de Martin R. Vanhove B. Cheng Q. Hofer E. Csizmadia V. Winkler H. Bach F.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2773-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 43Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Science. 1993; 259: 1912-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) by measuring the increase of IκB-α transcription in Northern blot hybridization analysis (Fig.2 a). IκB-α mRNA was hardly measured in unstimulated wild type and asmase −/− cells. However within 60 min after TNF-α stimulation a strong IκB-α mRNA signal appeared in wild type and in the mutant fibroblasts. Relating the IκB-α mRNA signals with the respective constitutively expressed β-actin signal and quantification of the signals by phosphorimaging clearly indicated thatasmase −/− and wild type EMFIs showed an identical expression rate. IκB-α is constitutively expressed at a very low level. The low concentration of mRNA was detected by amplification of a specific 125-bp fragment by RT-PCR. Fig. 2 b shows the RT-PCR pattern of EMFIs of the wild type and asmase −/−genotype, quiescent and after TNF-α stimulation for 30 and 60 min, respectively. Identical patterns of the expected 125-bp PCR fragment were observed in wild type and asmase −/−EMFIs, the intensity of the 348-bp β-actin PCR fragment in all lanes proved the Northern blot hybridization analysis. TNF-α stimulation induces the dissociation of the IκB-NF-κB complex liberating NF-κB for nuclear translocation and DNA binding (28Baeurle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar). We followed the kinetics of NF-κB nuclear translocation and DNA binding in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Double-stranded, 32P-labeled oligodeoxynucleotides resembling the NF-κB binding site of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat were incubated with nuclear protein extracts of wild type and asmase −/−EMFIs stimulated with TNF-α for the time periods indicated in Fig.3 a. Within 5 min of TNF-α stimulation the strong nuclear import reached a plateau, which was stable during prolonged TNF-α stimulation. The intensities of NF-κB oligonucleotide complexes formed in nuclear extracts of wild type and asmase −/− EMFIs were identical. The specificity of the signals was proven in the control experiments (Fig. 3 b). For an in vivo proof the nuclear import of NF-κB after TNF-α stimulation in wild type andasmase −/− EMFIs was followed by immunofluorescence microscopy. After TNF-α stimulation cells were permeabilized and incubated with the anti-NF-κB p65 antibody and subsequently with a Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG second antibody. The cellular distribution of the NF-κB-α signal in untreated and TNF-α-stimulated wild type and asmase −/−EMFIs is compared in Fig. 4. The nuclear staining of both TNF-α-treated cells (Fig. 4, b and d) was equal, whereas the untreated cells (Fig. 4, a andc) showed no nuclear immunofluorescence. The immunocytochemical data fully support the results of our biochemical analysis. After TNF-α stimulation, wild type as well as mutant EMFIs indiscriminately translocated NF-κB within a short time into the nucleus for DNA binding. Previous reports indicate that TNF-α stimulation of U937 cells increases NSM activity 2–3-fold within 90 s and ASM activity within 4 min (12Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). A rapid 70% increase of ceramide concentration within 2–3 min and a decrease of sphingomyelin concentration reaching 20% of control values of untreated cells after 5 min has been reported for Jurkat cells (23Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). When mouse embryonic fibroblasts with the wild type and ASM deficiency genotype were assayed after 0, 2, and 4 min of TNF-α stimulation, no significant increase of ASM activity of wild type was observed. The NSM assay (41Schütze S. Krönke M. Balkwill F.R. Cytokines: A Practical Approach. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, 1995: 93-109Google Scholar) at 0, 1, and 2 min after TNF-α stimulation indicated neither a measurable NSM activity nor an increase of the enzyme activity in wild type and asmase −/− EMFIs. Neutral sphingomyelinase is present only at a low level in nonneuronal tissue (8Otterbach B. Stoffel W. Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 44Spence M.W. Burgess J.K. Sperker E.R. Brain Res. 1979; 168: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results are supported by the measurement of the intracellular ceramide concentrations in wild type andasmase −/− EMFIs after TNF-α stimulation. We prelabeled EMFIs with [1-14C]palmitate for 36 h. Cells were thoroughly washed and stimulated with TNF-α for 1, 2, 5, and 20 min. Total lipids of EMFIs were isolated and separated by thin layer chromatography. The intensity of the radioactive ceramide and sphingomyelin bands were calculated and correlated with the individual phospholipid classes using the Image Quant software of the PhosphorImager (Fig. 5). Neither EMFIs from wild type nor ASM-deficient mice showed significant alterations of the sphingomyelin and ceramide concentrations after TNF-α stimulation. Jurkat T-cells, which overexpress recombinant ASM, constitutively show a dose-dependent NF-κB-specific transcription of a reporter gene without an external stimulus (12Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). We generated a stable, murine ASM-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cell line with an ASM activity 20-fold above basis level. They were stimulated with TNF-α for the periods indicated in Fig.6 and compared with wild type HEK cells. The time course of the NF-κB nuclear translocation followed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay was indistinguishable in wild type and ASM-overexpressing HEK cells and showed the same kinetics as in the EMFIs of wild type and asmase −/− mice. The asmase −/− mouse line offers a unique opportunity for studies on the function of ASM and NSM in the recently postulated signal transduction pathways triggered by TNF-α and interleukin 1 (2Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) or other effector molecules, e.g. CD28, Fas, or vitamin D3 (1Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). TNF-α is supposed to activate both acid and neutral sphingomyelinase. Initiation of NF-κB nuclear translocation is supposed to be transmitted exclusively by acid (lysosomal) sphingomyelinase generating the proposed second messenger ceramide. Diacylglycerol, which is released by a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, has been postulated as a link between TNF-α receptor 55 and lysosomal sphingomyelinase (23Schütze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). However, the existence of the enzyme remains uncertain. Taking these reports for granted, NF-κB activation should be precluded in ASM-deficient cells. The results described here indicate that NF-κB is activated in embryonic fibroblasts from wild type andasmase −/− mice when stimulated with TNF-α. The IκB-α-NF-κB complex is dissociated as demonstrated by the rapid transient proteolysis and resynthesis of IκB-α. Free cytosolic NF-κB is translocated into the nucleus shortly after TNF-α stimulation in EMFIs of both genotypes, which was proven by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear protein extracts and by immunocytochemistry. Our results clearly exclude acid sphingomyelinase from the signaling pathway leading to the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. Additionally no increase in ASM enzyme activity after short TNF-α incubation in wild type EMFIs was observed. Similar observations were made in studies with ASM-deficient Niemann-Pick disease A human fibroblasts (45Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 46Kuno K. Sukegawa K. Ishikawa Orii T. Matsushima K. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1269-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). NSM activity of wild type and asmase −/− EMFIs is apparently also not stimulated by TNF-α. The enzyme activity in extraneural cells so far analyzed is very low, and high activities were only measured in the central nervous system (8Otterbach B. Stoffel W. Cell. 1995; 81: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Embryonic fibroblasts seem to be almost devoid of NSM activity, as shown by the enzyme assay, which is in agreement with a previous report (47Levade T. Gatt S. Salvayre R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). If NSM of EMFIs is participating in the ceramide-activated pathway, then the activity is below the detection level of the assay used. Further studies will address the analysis of the function of NSM. It should be mentioned that most data for the function of ASM and NSM in signal transduction have been derived mainly from myeloid-lymphoid cell lines. Recent reports showed that NF-κB activation protects mouse embryonic fibroblasts from induction of apoptosis, suggesting a dissection of the TNF-α-induced signaling pathways (48Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 49Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

In our analysis we showed that neither acid nor neutral sphingomyelinase were activated, and no ceramide was generated in the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. Therefore we conclude that sphingomyelinases are not of general importance in TNF-α responses at all. We thank D. Newrzella for providing the HEK cell line."
https://openalex.org/W1997851573,"Cleavage of pre-mRNA during 3′-end formation in yeast requires two protein factors, cleavage factor I (CF I) and cleavage factor (CF II). A 5300-fold purification of CF II indicates that four polypeptides of 150, 105, 100, and 90 kDa copurify with CF II activity. The 150-kDa protein is recognized by antibodies against Cft1, the yeast homologue of the 160-kDa subunit of the mammalian cleavage/polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF). The 100-kDa subunit is identical to Brr5/Ysh1, a yeast protein with striking similarity to the 73-kDa subunit of CPSF. The 105-kDa protein, designated Cft2 (cleavage factor two) exhibits significant homology to the CPSF 100-kDa subunit. Cft2 is cross-linked to pre-mRNA substrate containing the poly(A) site and wild type upstream and downstream flanking sequences, but not to precleaved RNA lacking downstream sequences or to substrate in which the (UA)6 processing signal has been deleted. The specific binding of Cft2 to the RNA substrate is ATP-dependent, in agreement with the requirement of ATP for cleavage. The sequence-specific binding of Cft2 and the similarities of CF II subunits to those of CPSF supports the hypothesis that CF II functions in the cleavage of yeast mRNA 3′-ends in a manner analagous to that of CPSF in the mammalian system. These results provide additional evidence that certain features of the molecular mechanism of mRNA 3′-end formation are conserved between yeast and mammals, but also highlight unexpected differences.

These results provide additional evidence that certain features of the molecular mechanism of mRNA 3′-end formation are conserved between yeast and mammals, but also highlight unexpected differences. The formation of messenger RNA 3′-ends, an important step in maturation of eukaryotic mRNAs, requires two events, site-specific endonucleolytic cleavage of primary transcripts followed by poly(A) addition to the upstream fragment. While cleavage and polyadenylation are closely coupled in vivo, the two reactions can be experimentally uncoupled and assayed separately, allowing biochemical characterization of individual components. The 3′-end processing of mRNA depends on both cis-acting elements and trans-acting protein factors (for reviews, see Refs. 1Keller W. Cell. 1995; 81: 829-832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 222-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 3Wahle E. Biochim.

Six protein factors act in concert to recognize, cleave, and polyadenylate mammalian pre-mRNAs. Cleavage requires the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), 1The abbreviations used are: CPSF, cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor; CstF, cleavage stimulation factor; CF Im and CF IIm, mammalian cleavage factor I and cleavage factor II; PAP, poly(A) polymerase; PAB II, poly(A)-binding protein II; CF I and CF II, cleavage factor I and cleavage factor II (yeast); PF I, polyadenylation factor I; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography. cleavage stimulation factor (CstF), mammalian poly(A) polymerase (PAP), and two additional cleavage factors (CF Im and CF IIm). The poly(A) addition reaction needs PAP, CPSF, and poly(A)-binding protein II (PAB II). The recent purification of CF Im (5Ruegsegger U. Beyer K. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6107-6113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) leaves only CF IIm uncharacterized, and cDNAs encoding many of the proteins have been cloned (for a recent review, see Ref.4Wahle E. Keller W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 247-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The largest subunit (160 kDa) of CPSF binds specifically to the AAUAAA signal located upstream of the poly(A) site (6Keller W. Bienroth S. Lang K.M. Christofori G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4241-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 7Murthy K.G.K. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2672-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), and the CstF binds to the GU- or U-rich downstream element via its 64-kDa subunit (8MacDonald C.C. Wilusz J. Shenk T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6647-6654Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three cis-acting elements are thought to be necessary and sufficient for mRNA 3′-end formation (Refs. 9Guo Z. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5983-5990Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar and 10Guo Z. Sherman F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2772-2776Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar and references therein): the efficiency element formed by a UA repeat or related sequences, which functions by enhancing the efficiency of the positioning element; the positioning element, formed by AAUAAA or related sequences, which positions the cleavage site; and the actual cleavage site, a Py(A)n sequence. Both the efficiency and the positioning elements are found upstream of the poly(A) site. Four functionally distinct factors are required for specific cleavage and polyadenylation of yeast pre-mRNA in vitro (11Chen J. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cleavage factors I and II (CF I and CF II) are sufficient for the cleavage reaction, while specific poly(A) addition needs CF I, PAP, and polyadenylation factor I (PF I). Yeast PAP has been purified to homogeneity (12Lingner J. Radtke I. Wahle E. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8741-8746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the gene has been cloned (13Lingner J. Kellermann J. Keller W. Nature. 1991; 354: 496-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 14Patel D. Butler J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3297-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Rapid progress is being made using genetics and biochemistry to identify components of the other factors (15Manley J.L. Takagaki Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1481-1482Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The RNA14 and RNA15 genes encode two subunits of CF I (16Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1994; 266: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the gene for Pcf11, a 70-kDa CF I subunit, was obtained by virtue of its interaction with Rna14 and Rna15 in a two-hybrid screen (17Amrani N. Minet M. Wyers F. Dufour M. Aggerbeck L. Lacroute F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The latter approach also found a subunit of PF I, Fip1 (18Preker P.J. Lingner J. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Keller W. Cell. 1995; 81: 379-389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), as a PAP-interacting protein. The genes for two additional proteins, Brr5/Ysh1 (19Chanfreau G. Noble S.M. Guthrie C. Science. 1996; 274: 1511-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Jenny A. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1996; 274: 1514-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and Cft1 (21Stumpf G. Domdey H. Science. 1996; 274: 1517-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), were identified by their homology to genes encoding mammalian CPSF subunits. Cft1 is thought to be a subunit of the cleavage factor CF II (21Stumpf G. Domdey H. Science. 1996; 274: 1517-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), while Brr5/Ysh1 appears to have a role in both the cleavage and poly(A) addition steps (19Chanfreau G. Noble S.M. Guthrie C. Science. 1996; 274: 1511-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Jenny A. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1996; 274: 1514-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For Rna14, Rna15, Fip1, Brr5/Ysh1, and Cft1, extracts deficient in these proteins because of conditional mutations or immunodepletion are defective in processing and can be rescued by the addition of crude fractions containing the appropriate activity, thus supporting the assignment as a component of CF I, CF II, or PF I. In the case of Pcf11, this subunit has been found in crude fractions containing Rna14 and Rna15 (17Amrani N. Minet M. Wyers F. Dufour M. Aggerbeck L. Lacroute F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is important to verify the composition of these factors with a reconstituted system using purified factors. We recently described the purification of the yeast CF I and its separation into two functional components, CF IA and CF IB (22Kessler M.M. Zhao J. Moore C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27167-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CF IA contains four polypeptides, and this biochemical analysis has confirmed the designation of Rna14, Rna15, and Pcf11 as subunits of CF IA (22Kessler M.M. Zhao J. Moore C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27167-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). 2M. M. Kessler, unpublished data. CF IB is a single 73-kDa protein. Here we report that four polypeptides (p150, p105, p100, and p90) copurify with CF II activity. The 150-kDa subunit is recognized by antibodies against Cft1, a yeast homologue of the 160-kDa subunit of mammalian CPSF (21Stumpf G. Domdey H. Science. 1996; 274: 1517-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). p100 is identical to the Brr5/Ysh1 protein, which has similarity to the 73-kDa CPSF subunit (19Chanfreau G. Noble S.M. Guthrie C. Science. 1996; 274: 1511-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20Jenny A. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Preker P.J. Keller W. Science. 1996; 274: 1514-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). p105, termed Cft2, is a previously uncharacterized protein which binds pre-mRNA in a sequence-specific, ATP-dependent fashion and has significant homology to the 100-kDa subunit of mammalian CPSF. We discuss the implications of these findings to our growing understanding of the molecular mechanism of mRNA 3′-end formation in yeast. Capped and uniformly32P-labeled RNAs used as substrates for the cleavage and poly(A) addition reactions and ultraviolet cross-linking assays were prepared from the following plasmids by in vitrotranscription of linearized DNA templates as described by Chenet al. (11Chen J. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Full-length GAL7-1 RNA containing the GAL7poly(A) site and flanking sequences was prepared from pJCGAL7-1 (11Chen J. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and a mutated version of the full-length precursor, GAL7-2 RNA, which lacks the (UA)6 repeat upstream of the poly(A) site, was prepared from the plasmid pJCGAL7-2 (11Chen J. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Precleaved wild type GAL7-9 RNA, which lacks sequences downstream of the poly(A) site, was prepared from pJCGAL7-9 (23Zhelkovsky A.M. Kessler M.M. Moore C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26715-26720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All precursors were purified from 8.3m urea, 5% polyacrylamide gels (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.23-11.28Google Scholar), precipitated with ethanol, and stored frozen at −20 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Highly purified CF I eluting from a heparin-HiTrap column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was prepared as described (22Kessler M.M. Zhao J. Moore C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27167-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Broad range protein markers for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, prestained marker proteins, and purified bovine serum albumin (BSA) were from New England Biolabs Inc. Protein markers used for gel filtration were from Pharmacia, and ribonuclease A was from Sigma. Protein concentrations were determined according to the Bradford assay (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217317) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad kit and BSA as standard. The protein concentration in very dilute fractions was estimated by comparison with BSA standards on slot blots stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver (26Dunbar B.D. Protein Blotting: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). The KCl concentration in column fractions was determined by measuring the conductivity of a 1/1000 dilution and comparing with standards made with the same composition and known amounts of KCl. The pH of all buffering compounds was adjusted at room temperature and at a concentration of 1 m. Buffer A contained 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.25, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. Buffer B was identical to buffer A except that Tris-HCl, pH 7.90, at 20 mm replaced the potassium phosphate. All buffers were supplemented with KCl as indicated. The concentration of protease inhibitors used in the chromatographic steps were as follows. Buffers used to apply the sample to the phosphocellulose column contained 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 μmleupeptin, and 0.5 μm pepstatin A. Buffers used to elute proteins from the phosphocellulose column and for application to the Bio-Rex column contained 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.06 μm leupeptin, and 0.2 μmpepstatin A. Buffers for elution of proteins from the Bio-Rex column and for application to Mono Q and heparin-Sepharose columns contained 0.05 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.03 μm leupeptin, and 0.1 μm pepstatin A. All further steps were carried out without protease inhibitors. The purification protocol for CF II is shown schematically in Fig. 1. All procedures were performed at 0–4 °C. After each step, samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. S. cerevisiae cells (bakers' yeast) were purchased from Red Star (Randolph, MA). Whole cell extract preparation, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and Q-Sepharose chromatography were as described by Kessler et al. (22Kessler M.M. Zhao J. Moore C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27167-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Fractions containing CF II, which eluted from a Q-Sepharose column with 300–500 mm KCl (∼50 mg of protein), were pooled, dialyzed against 4 liters of buffer A supplemented with 100 mm KCl for 4 h, and applied to a 25-ml phosphocellulose P-11 column (Whatman; equilibrated in the same buffer) at 21 ml/h. After washing with two column volumes of buffer A + 100 mm KCl, proteins were eluted with a gradient of 100–500 mm KCl in three column volumes of buffer A. Active fractions, which eluted at 150–300 mm KCl (∼14 mg of protein), were pooled, dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer A + 50 mm KCl for 2 h, and applied to 7-ml Bio-Rex 70 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in the same buffer at 20 ml/h. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer A + 50 mm KCl and was eluted with 2 column volumes of buffer A + 250 mm KCl and 3 column volumes of buffer A + 500 mm KCl. Most of the CF II activity (>80%) was eluted with buffer A + 250 mmKCl in a volume of 12 ml. The CF II containing sample (∼7.9 mg of protein) was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B + 50 mm KCl for 2 h and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono Q HR 5/5 FPLC column (Pharmacia) at 0.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of the dialysis buffer and protein eluted with a gradient of 50–100 mm KCl (10 column volumes) and then with a gradient of 100–500 mm KCl (40 column volumes) at 0.5 ml/min. CF II activity came out between 280 and 330 mm KCl. Fractions with CF II activity (∼1.6 mg of protein) were pooled and dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer A + 100 mm KCl for 2 h and applied to a prepacked 1-ml heparin-HiTrap column (Pharmacia) at 10 ml/h. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A + 100 mm KCl and then with buffer A + 250 mm KCl, and CF II was eluted with buffer A + 500 mm KCl. The CF II-containing sample (∼0.15 mg of protein) was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B + 50 mm KCl for 2 h and loaded onto a 0.5-ml poly(A)-Sepharose column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in the same buffer at 2 ml/h. After washing the column with 3 column volumes of this buffer, the proteins were eluted with 3 × 0.5-ml steps of buffer B + 250 mm KCl and 3 × 0.5 ml buffer B + 500 mm KCl by gravity flow. CF II activity came out with 250 mm KCl. The addition of 0.01% Nonidet P-40 to the pooled fractions containing CF II activity from the poly(A)-Sepharose column improved the recovery of CF II activity from the subsequent column about 10-fold. The pooled fractions (1 ml, ∼27 μg of protein) were concentrated to approximately 4-fold using Ultrafree-MC 30,000 nominal molecular weight limit concentrators (Millipore), and 0.2 ml of the concentrate was applied onto a 25-ml Superose 6 HR 10/30 FPLC column (Pharmacia) equilibrated in buffer A + 150 mm KCl + 0.01% Nonidet P-40 at 0.2 ml/min. The column was developed with the same buffer, and fractions of 0.5-ml were collected. Cleavage reactions were assembled on ice in a volume of 12 μl containing 1 mm magnesium acetate, 75 mm potassium acetate, 2% polyethylene glycol (polyethylene glycol 8000, Fisher), 2 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 10 nm radioactive full-length GAL7-1 RNA (8 ng), 1.5 μm (0.6 μg) tRNA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 units of RNasin (Promega) and 0.1 mg/ml purified BSA, 1.0 μl of partially purified CF I, and the amount of CF II indicated, usually 3.0–5.0 μl from gradient-eluted fractions and 0.5–1.0 μl from step-eluted fractions. The final concentration of KCl was kept below 50 mm. Creatine phosphate was eliminated from the reaction for the assay of CF II fractions obtained after the Bio-Rex 70 column. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, stopped with proteinase K and SDS as described (11Chen J. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), diluted to 30 μl with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, extracted once with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and [1,10] of the reaction was separated on a 5% acrylamide-8.3 m urea gel and visualized by autoradiography or with a PhosphorImager (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics). For quantitation of CF II activity, cleavage assay gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 1 h, the screen scanned using the PhosphorImager, and the ImageQuant program (version 1.0 for Macintosh, Molecular Dynamics) used to display the scanned image and determine the amount of precursor and cleavage products. All the values obtained were corrected by subtracting the background value determined from that region of an empty lane. Cleavage activity was calculated by dividing the total amount of upstream and downstream cleavage products by the sum of precursor and cleavage products. One activity unit is defined as the amount of CF II that can cleave 50% of the input precursor RNA under the conditions given above. Aliquots of fractions from the Q-Sepharose, phosphocellulose, Bio-Rex, Mono Q, heparin, and poly(A)-Sepharose columns were dialyzed against 100–500 volumes of buffer A + 50 mm KCl for 1.5 h before use in processing assays. The fractions from Superose 6 gel filtration were concentrated 10-fold in Millipore microconcentrators before being assayed. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were prepared and run according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207461) Google Scholar). Silver staining was according to Gottlieb and Chavko (28Gottlieb M. Chavko M. Anal.

Skvorak A. Moore C.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1750-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using a 1:1000 dilution of polyclonal serum against Cft1, a generous gift of G. Stumpf and H. Domdey (21Stumpf G. Domdey H. Science. 1996; 274: 1517-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Reactions (16 μl) were assembled on ice and contained 1 mm magnesium acetate, 75 mmpotassium acetate, 1.5 μm tRNA, 1 mm ATP (added as indicated), 20 nm radioactive RNA substrate, and 10 μl of pure CF II from the Superose 6 column or 10 μl of highly purified CF II from the poly(A)-Sepharose column. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min and then irradiated at room temperature with UV light for 10 × 30 s at 120 mJ/cm2 (UV Stratalinker 1800, Stratagene) on parafilm lying on a glass plate at a distance of 15 cm. The samples were digested with ribonuclease A (Sigma, 0.9 μg/μl) for 30 min at 37 °C, and proteins were separated on a 7% polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. The gel was stained with silver, dried, and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen for 2 days. Proteins were separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and the gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Bands were excised from the gel and peptides derived from these proteins subjected to microsequencing by William Lane at the Harvard University Microchemistry Facility (Cambridge, MA), using collisionally activated dissociation on a Finnigan TSO 7000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Homology searches were performed using the BLAST program (30Altschul S. Gish W. Miller W. Meyers E. Lipman D. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71280) Google Scholar) and sequence alignments made using DNASTAR programs (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI), with the PAM250 Weight Table, in which amino acid residues with a score of greater than 0 are considered biochemically related and those with a score of 0 or higher as evolutionarily related. Four functionally distinct factors (CF I, CF II, PF I, and PAP) must be combined to reconstitute cleavage and polyadenylation of yeast precursor mRNA (11Chen J. Moore C.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3470-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). For this study, we undertook purification of the CF II factor, using seven chromatographic steps as shown schematically in Fig. 1. This purification is summarized in Table I. During purification, CF II activity tends to spread over many fractions when eluted with a salt gradient, and alternate gradient and stepwise elutions were used to keep CF II concentrated during chromatography. For example, the Bio-Rex 70 step did not result in increased specific activity (Table I), but it concentrated approximately 12-fold a sample that had become very dilute after two successive gradient-developed chromatographic steps (the Q-Sepharose column and the phosphocellulose column). Column fractions were assayed for reconstitution of endonucleolytic cleavage of pre-mRNA (GAL7-1 RNA) in an reaction containing CF I purified from a heparin-Sepharose column (22Kessler M.M. Zhao J. Moore C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27167-27175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After the final step, Superose 6 chromatography, an overall purification of about 5300-fold and yield of 2.7% was achieved.Table IPurification of yeast CF IIStepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%-foldCell extract7000AmSO4 precipitation830Q-Sepharose50920061Phosphocellulose14600042965.29.2Bio-Rex 707.9370046840.210.1Mono Q1.62200137523.929.3Heparin-Sepharose0.15190012,66620.6270.0Poly(A)-Sepharose0.027140051,85215.21107.0Superose 60.001250250,0002.75314.0CF II was purified from yeast cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Quantitation of CF II was only possible after separation from CF I, PF I, and PAP on the Q-Sepharose column. One activity unit is defined as the amount of CF II required to cleave 50% of the input pre-mRNA under the reaction conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (1976) or was estimated by comparison with BSA standards on slot blots stained with silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Open table in a new tab CF II was purified from yeast cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Quantitation of CF II was only possible after separation from CF I, PF I, and PAP on the Q-Sepharose column. One activity unit is defined as the amount of CF II required to cleave 50% of the input pre-mRNA under the reaction conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (1976) or was estimated by comparison with BSA standards on slot blots stained with silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The cleavage assay using fractions from the Superose 6 column is shown in Fig. 2 A. CF II activity was spread over 10 fractions, but peaked in fractions 22–24, and only these fractions were used to determine yield. Proteins in the Superose 6 fractions were separated on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and stained with silver. Four polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 150, 105, 100, and 90 kDa copurified with CF II activity (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–7, and Fig. 2 B, lanes 3–5). Additional polypeptides can be found in fraction 24 (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). Independent purifications using the same protocol, or using the same columns but in different sequence, showed the same four polypeptides copurifying with CF II activity. From the silver-stained gel, the 150-, 105-, 100-, and 90-kDa polypeptides appear present in an approximately equimolar ratio. The combined mass of the CF II polypeptides is 445 kDa, assuming that each is represented only once in the complex. The elution position of CF II from the Superose 6 gel filtration column indicates that CF II is a large complex in the range of 600–700 kDa. Elution behavior upon gel filtration most accurately correlates with the Stokes radius of the particle rather than molecular size (31Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). The Stokes radius of CF II was determined to be near 100 Å by comparison with standard proteins (31Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar). This is similar to that of mammalian CPSF, a complex of four polypeptides with combined molecular mass of 360 kDa and a Stokes radius of approximately 100 Å (32Bienroth S. Wahle E. Suter-Crazzolara C. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The large Stokes radius of CF II relative to its molecular mass (∼445 kDa) suggests that the shape of CF II is nonspherical. Purified CF II when mixed with partially purified CF I can cleave wild type full-length RNA, but not mutant RNA, which lacks the (UA)6repeat (Fig. 3). This result indicates that substrate specificity is retained during the purification of CF II, if this specificity is rendered by CF II. Ultraviolet (UV) cross-linking analysis was then used to test whether CF II can bind precursor RNA. The CF II-containing fraction from the poly(A)-Sepharose column was incubated with different radioactive RNA substrates in the presence of tRNA as an nonspecific competitor. The mixture was then irradiated with UV light, treated with RNase A, and resolved on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and radioactively tagged proteins visualized by PhosphorImager analysis. The 105-kDa protein in CF II was cross-linked to the wild type full-length precursor RNA, but not to RNA lacking the (UA)6 repeat or to precleaved RNA (Fig.4 B, lanes 2–4). Silver staining of the same gel clearly shows the comigration of the 105-kDa protein band and the radioactively tagged species (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 3). A reaction using pure CF II from the Superose 6 column showed the exact same cross-linked band (Fig. 4 B, lane 5), confirming the identity of the 105-kDa protein.Figure 4The 105-kDa protein (Cft2) of CF II can be specifically UV cross-linked to pre-mRNA in an ATP-dependent manner. Cross-linking reactions were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 10 μl of the CF II-containing fraction from the poly(A)-Sepharose column was incubated with different 32P-labeled RNA substrates in the presence of tRNA as nonspecific competitor, UV-irradiated, treated with RNase A, and separated on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.

Here we have shown that no causal relationship exists between DNA degradation and chromatin condensation in glucocorticoid-induced thymocyte apoptosis. The chromatin rearrangement occurred independent of as well as prior to DNA cleavage and involved a specific conformational change at the nucleosome level. In the early stages of the process, the core particles appeared to be tightly packed face-to-face in smooth 11-nm filaments that progressively folded to generate a closely woven network. The network finally collapsed, producing dense apoptotic bodies. Since trypsin digestion relaxed condensed chromatin and histone H4 underwent appreciable deacetylation in the apoptotic cell, we suggest that changes in the DNA-histone interactions represented a major modulating factor of condensation. Chromatin condensation and DNA cleavage at internucleosomal sites have been recognized early as hallmarks of apoptosis, and it has been suggested that extensive DNA chain scission could directly result in the formation of dense chromatin bodies. Here we have shown that no causal relationship exists between DNA degradation and chromatin condensation in glucocorticoid-induced thymocyte apoptosis.

The network finally collapsed, producing dense apoptotic bodies. Since trypsin digestion relaxed condensed chromatin and histone H4 underwent appreciable deacetylation in the apoptotic cell, we suggest that changes in the DNA-histone interactions represented a major modulating factor of condensation. Although the term “apoptosis” was originally derived from the Greek to emphasize cytoplasmic and nuclear alterations peculiar to the process of programmed cell death (1Kerr J.F.R. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (12470) Google Scholar), no attempt has been made thus far to search for the molecular events underlying these changes, particularly the collapse of the bulk of chromatin into dense domains. The reasons for this delay in the development of a fundamental approach are manifold. In the first place, the unique condensed appearance of the apoptotic nucleus is closely associated with the cleavage of chromatin at internucleosomal sites (2Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4120) Google Scholar), a circumstance that supports the hypothesis of a causal relationship between extensive chromatin digestion and condensation (3Arends M.J. Morris R.G. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 593-608PubMed Google Scholar). This early view has recently been challenged on the basis of more refined determinations of the chain length of the DNA isolated from apoptotic cells (4Tomei L.D. Shapiro J.P. Cope F.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 5Walker P.R. Sikorska M. Biochem.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20239-20241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) but has long distracted from the search for the molecular mechanisms involved in the process of condensation. Moreover, since apoptosis plays a key regulatory role in several physiological and pathological processes, major efforts are currently being directed to the elucidation of the biochemical aspects and to the identification of the genes involved in the activation of the cell death program. The onset of chromatin condensation might direct the orderly turning off of genes required for the execution of metabolic suicide, therefore warranting a detailed structural characterization of apoptotic chromatin and a search for terminal modulating factors. Bearing in mind the spatial distribution of interphase chromatin, the appearance of the apoptotic nucleus immediately suggests the occurrence of a structural change involving extremely large domains, and the question arises whether a specific conformational transition at the nucleosome level might account for such a catastrophic phenomenon. In the first place, is chromatin in apoptosis characterized by a three-dimensional array of nucleosomes different from that prevailing in the interphase 30-nm fiber? It has recently become apparent that the polynucleosomal chain can exhibit a marked polymorphism, depending on the prevailing mode of interaction among nucleosomes. Both edge-to-edge and face-to-face contacts arrayed in a fixed helical path are effective in the stabilization of the solenoidal structure (7Widom J. Klug A. Cell. 1985; 43: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), but the recent confirmation of the presence of marked irregularities in the conformation of the interphase fiber points to the existence of a variety of nucleosomal packing conformations (8Zlatanova J. Leuba S.H. Yang G. Bustamante C. van Holde K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5277-5280Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). At physiological ionic strength, homogeneous reconstituted oligonucleosomes in the absence of H1 fold into a contacting 90° “zig-zag” helical structure (9Hansen J.C. Ausio J. Stark V.H. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In a recent paper, we have shown that the nucleosomes interact weakly in the 30-nm fiber. The experimental value of the interaction free energy is as low in magnitude as −5 kcal/nucleosome mole (10Russo I. Barboro P. Alberti I. Parodi I. Balbi C. Allera C. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), so that even limited biochemical modifications of the histone complement could result in a structural change. In this report we show that the basic conformational feature of chromatin in apoptosis is the tight face-to-face packaging of nucleosomes, which might be related to the increase in the amount of the unacetylated forms of histones H3 and H4 occurring in the course of condensation. Suspensions of thymocytes from suckling rats were treated with 10−5mmethylprednisolone sodium succinate (MPS) 1The abbreviations used are: MPS, methylprednisolone sodium succinate; DM, dissociation medium; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; AUT, acetic acid/urea/Triton X-100 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. for different time periods, following Wyllie et al. (11Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar); the cells were incubated at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml. Nuclei were obtained by incubation of the pelleted cells in dissociation medium (DM) (75 mm NaCl, 24 mm Na2EDTA, 5 mmNaHSO3, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.8) containing 0.15% (v/v) Triton X-100, following the procedure already employed for calf thymus (12Cavazza B. Brizzolara G. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Piccardo M. Barboro P. Parodi S. Pasini A. Balbi C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9060-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar); in the digestion experiments nuclei were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h with 50 units/ml micrococcal nuclease (Sigma) according to Russo et al. (10Russo I. Barboro P. Alberti I. Parodi I. Balbi C. Allera C. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For electron microscopy of thin sections, control, glucocorticoid-treated cells, and nuclei were pelleted at 150 ×g for 10 min; fixation, embedding, and sectioning were performed as already reported (13Barboro P. Pasini A. Parodi S. Balbi C. Cavazza B. Allera C. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1690-1699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated by digestion of purified nuclei with proteinase K (Serva) in 10 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, pH 8.0, followed by extraction with phenol and chloroform, and the chain length distribution of the fragments was analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. I. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed as already reported (12Cavazza B. Brizzolara G. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Piccardo M. Barboro P. Parodi S. Pasini A. Balbi C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9060-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 13Barboro P. Pasini A. Parodi S. Balbi C. Cavazza B. Allera C. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1690-1699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nuclei were isolated from control and from MPS-treated thymocytes as described above. The material was resuspended in DM and pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min; weighed amounts (from 30 to 50 mg) of nuclear pellet were then transferred into large volume (75-μl) calorimetric capsules. Measurements were performed with a Perkin-Elmer DSC7 (Perkin-Elmer Corp.) at a scan rate of 10 °C/min (12Cavazza B. Brizzolara G. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Piccardo M. Barboro P. Parodi S. Pasini A. Balbi C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9060-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ten mg of pelleted nuclei were incubated in 10 ml of 0.1 mmNa2EDTA, pH 7.2, at 4 °C for 45 min; long incubation times (5 h) were required to completely unfold the condensed chromatin domains. In certain experiments, after a 45-min incubation chromatin was condensed by adjusting the concentration of Na+ with appropriate amounts of concentrated DM to 0.128 m. The nuclear suspensions were then centrifuged at 1,700 × gfor 15 min, and chromatin was fixed by overnight dialysis of the supernatant at 4 °C against 0.1 mm Na2EDTA or DM containing 0.1% glutaraldehyde. The concentration of DNA was then adjusted to 3 μg/ml, and chromatin was mounted for electron microscopy on carbon-coated grids according to a standard protocol (15Sogo J.M. Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 142-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The specimens were shadowed with platinum and observed in a Siemens 102 electron microscope operating at 80 kV. Trypsin digestion and topoisomerase I treatment were carried out as follows. One mg of pelleted nuclei was resuspended in 1 ml of DM and digested with 100 μg/ml trypsin (type 8642, Sigma) at 25 °C for 15 min or 1 h as already reported (12Cavazza B. Brizzolara G. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Piccardo M. Barboro P. Parodi S. Pasini A. Balbi C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9060-9072Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For reaction with topoisomerase I (TopoGEN) 40 mg of nuclear pellets were incubated in 0.5 ml of 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in the presence of 500 units/ml enzyme for 3 h at 25 °C. Either preparation was processed for electron microscopy at low ionic strength as described above. For acetic acid/urea/Triton X-100 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (AUT), the histone complement was extracted from pelleted nuclei with protamine sulfate as described by Loidl and Gröbner (16Loidl P. Gröbner P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3746-3762Google Scholar) in the presence of 5 mm sodium butyrate to inhibit histone deacetylase; the samples were run onto 14% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.9 m acetic acid, 6.7m urea, and 0.375% Triton X-100 as described by Nickelet al. (17Nickel B.E. Roth S.Y. Cook R.G. Allis D. Davie J.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); for quantitative analysis the gels were scanned on an LKB UltroScan XL densitometer, and the percentage of the acetylated isoforms of H4 was determined under the assumption that the dye yields the same color response for all the species. The determination of dynamically acetylated lysine residues was carried out exactly as described by Zhang and Nelson (18Zhang D. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) except that the incubation medium contained 0.1 mm sodium acetate and 3 mCi of [3H]acetate (Amersham Corp., 2.8 Ci/mmol). For fluorography, nuclei were resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer; the proteins were electrophoresed on 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204700) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were then revealed according to the method described in Ref. 18Zhang D. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar. To characterize the time course of apoptosis including early events, thymocytes from suckling rats were treated with MPS for different times (1, 4, 12, and 18 h) following the procedures of Wyllie et al. (11Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). The correlation between changes in the morphology of chromatin and DNA cleavage is shown in Fig.1. The general trend conforms to previous observations (2Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1980; 284: 555-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (4120) Google Scholar, 3Arends M.J. Morris R.G. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 593-608PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar, 20Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1982; 109: 78-87PubMed Google Scholar), although some new information has resulted. The DNA from cells treated for 1 h (Fig. 1 B) does not migrate significantly through a 1.5% agarose gel, thus showing that the fragments have a chain length higher than ∼4 kilobase pairs (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. I. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar); almost all of the cells have a markedly enlarged nucleus and a looser chromatin texture compared with the controls (Fig. 1 A). After a 4-h exposure to MPS, the chromatin changes associated with apoptosis can be clearly recognized (Fig. 1 C); at this time, the percentage of apoptotic thymocytes is ∼18% as evaluated by isopyknic centrifugation on step Percoll gradients (20Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1982; 109: 78-87PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). Two distinct cellular subpopulations can be identified by electron microscopy. One corresponds to thymocytes that are clearly undergoing apoptosis; chromatin is packaged in dense masses beneath the nuclear envelope. The other shows the same nuclear morphology (i.e. chromatin dispersion in thin punctuate bundles) as the thymocytes treated for 1 h. Centrifugation of the isolated DNA at 10,000 × g for 20 min in the buffer used for digestion with proteinase K prior to purification (see “Experimental Procedures”) yielded a pellet corresponding to more than 95% of the starting material in the form of very long fragments (lane 1in Fig. 1 C) and a supernatant (lane 2) containing the oligonucleosomal ladder, therefore affording biochemical evidence of the heterogeneity of the cell culture. Finally, after a 12-h exposure to MPS, an almost homogeneous population of apoptotic cells results; more than 95% of nuclei have changed into apoptotic bodies, while 40% of the DNA still possess a chain length higher than 1.4 kilobase pairs (Fig. 1 E). Only minor additional morphological changes were detected when the treatment was protracted for 18 h; nuclei underwent a somewhat more extensive fragmentation and there was a further decrease in the content of high molecular weight DNA (Fig. 1 F). While this brief re-examination of well established phenomenological features of apoptosis was needed to frame the new observations reported here, it clearly leaves the problem of the interrelation between DNA cleavage and chromatin condensation unsolved. Conventional electron microscopy of thin nuclear section is capable of detecting gross rearrangements of chromatin, but it fails to image the underlying structural details as a consequence of the poor penetration of the stain into the embedding resin. The electron micrographs reported in Fig. 1, B and C, indicate that two successive morphological stages are involved in the onset of apoptosis and further suggest that the unfolding of the 30-nm fiber might represent an early event but do not serve the purpose of ascertaining the occurrence of changes in the spatial arrangement of nucleosomes. At the same time, the lack of resolution of conventional agarose gel electrophoresis beyond ∼4 kilobase pairs (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. I. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) does not allow a determination of the size distribution of long DNA fragments. It has been reported that micrococcal nuclease digestion of nuclei from normal thymocytes induces morphologic changes in chromatin that mimic apoptotic condensation (3Arends M.J. Morris R.G. Wyllie A.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1990; 136: 593-608PubMed Google Scholar). We have confirmed this result (Fig. 1 G), but unfortunately micrococcal nuclease is known to digest the RNA (21Reddi K.K. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 12: 257-262Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and this process elicits nuclear rearrangements superficially reminiscent of those occurring in apoptosis (22Nickerson J.A. Krochmaln I.C. Wan K.M. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recent reports using a variety of approaches suggest that alterations in chromatin may occur in the absence of internucleosomal cleavage (4Tomei L.D. Shapiro J.P. Cope F.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 23Oberhammer F. Fritsch G. Schmied M. Pavelka M. Printz D. Purchio T. Lassmann H. Schulte-Hermann R. J.

Only with the application of pulsed field gel electrophoresis to the study of DNA chain length is it possible to reveal the occurrence, at the earliest stages of the process, of long range fragmentation at the level of the higher order structure or of the loop (5Walker P.R. Sikorska M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 6Lagarkova M.A. Iarovaia O.V. Razin S.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20239-20241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To establish in a straightforward way whether apoptosis involves a structural change of chromatin relative to controls, we carried out DSC determinations on nuclei isolated from normal or MPS-treated thymocytes. The principles and application of DSC technique are simple. For biological macromolecules, the measurements are normally carried out on solutions or gels. The sample is transferred into high pressure calorimetric capsules, and its temperature is increased in the instrument at a constant rate. When the denaturation temperature of the macromolecular solute is reached, the unfolding process gives rise to a peak in the heat absorption curve as a function of the temperature. A typical thermogram consists of a series of heat absorption peaks (or thermal transitions) with each peak corresponding to the unfolding of an energetically distinguishable domain. Due to its sharp subdivision into two basic supramolecular domains (the linker and the core particle) the polynucleosomal chain lends itself to conformational studies by DSC. Therefore, this technique is a powerful tool for investigating the overall organization of chromatin in situ(10Russo I. Barboro P. Alberti I. Parodi I. Balbi C. Allera C. Lazzarini G. Patrone E.

The thermal denaturation profile of interphase nuclei shows two major heat absorption peaks (labeled IV andV in Fig. 1 H) at 90 and 107 °C that arise from the melting of the core particle DNA when the core particle is placed within an unfolded loop and the higher order structure domains, respectively (12Cavazza B.

Thus, the structural changes of nuclear chromatin can be quantitatively detected. By this approach, we and others have previously characterized the condensation process induced by salts (12Cavazza B.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in the absence of DNA cleavage as well as the effect of endogenous or exogenous nucleases (26Balbi C. Abelmoschi M.L. Gogioso L. Parodi S. Barboro P. Cavazza B. Patrone E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3220-3227Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The DSC analysis of nuclear chromatin from thymocytes undergoing apoptosis led to a clear-cut result (Fig. 1 H). After a 1-h exposure (scan 2), transition V (marked byarrows in scans 1–3,5) at 107 °C (which is dominant in the thermogram of control thymocytes (scan 1)) decreases, while the 90 °C endotherm sharply increases; at this point the DNA is undegraded, while electron microscopy shows diffuse nuclear changes (Fig. 1 B). Cells treated for 4 h show nothing but a shoulder at 103 °C (scan 3) and a dominant endotherm at 90 °C despite the fact that ∼95% of the DNA still has a high molecular weight (Fig. 1 C). The fact that the calorimetric response characteristic of interphase chromatin is lost early in the absence of appreciable internucleosomal cleavage points to the occurrence of an overall structural rearrangement early in the induction of apoptosis. The basic features of the structural change became apparent when chromatin was isolated by brief extraction at low ionic strength of nuclei from thymocytes treated for 12 or 18 h with MPS and fixed with glutaraldehyde to preserve the morphology present inside the cell. Neither filaments of nucleosomes nor the 30-nm solenoidal fiber could be observed by conventional electron microscopy of isolated chromatin (15Sogo J.M. Thoma F. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 142-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Instead, much of the material is organized in dense clumps surrounded by a network of smooth tortuous fibers 11 nm in diameter (Fig. 2 B); often the network reduces to a halo of small loops (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that the central body corresponds to a nucleation center of an ongoing condensation process. Less condensed domains can also be found, confirming that successive steps are involved in the structural change. For example, the morphology of the sample shown in Fig. 2 Asuggests that the polynucleosomal chain forms very long 11-nm filaments before collapsing into dense bodies; it is apparent that the network represents an intermediate state arising from the folding of the filament on itself. Therefore, the basic structural difference between apoptotic chromatin and the “normal” counterpart mainly resides in the mode of interaction of nucleosomes; they appear to be tightly associated face-to-face, at variance with their radial disposition around the solenoid axis in the 30-nm fiber (7Widom J. Klug A. Cell. 1985; 43: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This array is evident in high resolution micrographs. In certain regions, the orientation of the nucleosomes perpendicular to the carbon support film allows the visualization of the turns of DNA wrapped around the octamer (arrowheads in Fig. 2 G). We have characterized the perturbations induced in the structure of apoptotic chromatin by changes in ionic strength and by the selective digestion of core histones with trypsin. Prolonged exposure to a low salt buffer induces extensive unfolding of the domains, while the 11-nm filaments are not appreciably affected (Fig. 2 E). Equilibration with DM (Na+ concentration, 0.128m) restores the dense bodies (Fig. 2 F). Thus, condensation in apoptosis is still driven by the screening of the electrostatic repulsion among phosphate groups, but the filaments are unable to undergo the transition to the 30-nm fiber. Trypsin digestion, which is known to degrade H1 and to detach the N-terminal tails of core histones (28Allan J. Harborne N. Rau D.C. Gould H. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), unravels the dense bodies and the fibrillar network (Fig. 3 B) up to the extensive unfolding of the nucleosome (Fig. 3 A). Very long stretches of DNA are frequently found; they are punctuated by dots, presumably due to the globular domains of histones that are still bound (arrows in Fig. 3 A). Thus, as with interphase chromatin, the picture emerges that a major modulating factor of condensation resides in the interaction among the charged N-terminal domains and DNA. Since at physiological ionic strength the interaction free energy among nucleosomes in the 30-nm fiber is as low as a few kcal/nucleosome mole (10Russo I. Barboro P. Alberti I. Parodi I. Balbi C. Allera C. Lazzarini G. Patrone E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), even limited biochemical modifications might be sufficient to bring about the structural change. We have investigated in some detail the time course of the level of core histone acetylation using AUT (17Nickel B.E. Roth S.Y. Cook R.G. Allis D. Davie J.R. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which separates the acetylated isoforms of H4. We have found that the percentage of the unacetylated isoform increases significantly during the induction of apoptosis, passing from 42.3 ± 0.4% in control thymocytes to 70.3 ± 5% in apoptotic cells (Fig. 4 A). To inspect this result more closely, we have determined the percentage of lysine residues in core histones undergoing active acetylation-deacetylation by following the method of Zhang and Nelson (18Zhang D. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1986; 240: 857-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When a radiolabel ([3H]acetate) was added to the cell culture after a 2-h exposure to MPS and the sample was counted for radioactivity after 2 h, the percentage of dynamically acetylated lysines was 4.23 ± 0.95% and 4.14 ± 0.50% for control and treated cells, respectively (Fig. 4 D). When this protocol was applied to cells treated for 10 and 16 h, the incorporation dropped to 1.75 ± 0.07% and 0.53 ± 0.05%. These results taken together suggest that modulation of apoptosis relies at least in part on a decrease in the acetylation rate. The occurrence of a concomitant increase in the deacetylation rate cannot, of course, be ruled out on the basis of the present experiments. The deacetylation of H4 can play two alternative functional roles. For viable cells, a great deal of evidence supports the hypothesis that highly acetylated core histones are preferentially associated with active or potentially active (competent) chromatin regions (29Zhang D. Nelson D.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Since it has to be expected that the cellular death program involves a progressive turning off of gene activity, H4 deacetylation might act as a general modulating factor of repression by supporting the compaction of the structure of transcribed genes. Alternatively, deacetylation might spread over the bulk of the chromatin, thereby triggering the massive structural change. The observed decrease in the acetylation of H4, if scattered throughout the genome, should increase the number of positive charges/nucleosome by 0.45 ± 0.10; the same figure is expected to arise from the deacetylation of H3 since these histones behave similarly in the incorporation experiments. The charge increase could in turn cause additional base pairs of DNA to interact with the histone core, thus forcing the central region of the linker to wind in a compensating right-handed toroidal supercoil. Leaving the detailed molecular interpretation out of consideration, it must be stressed that our experimental findings are consistent with the hypothesis that an increase in the topological constraints of the linker directs the structural change. Therefore, relaxation of the supercoiled DNA domain should result in the re-establishment of the beads on a string configuration. The micrograph shown in Fig. 3 C indeed supports this model, since the treatment of apoptotic chromatin with topoisomerase I abruptly converts the fibrillar network into a field of well separated, connected nucleosomes.

Staged in vitro reactions demonstrate that a Tn10 synaptic complex can become committed to a particular target DNA molecule via a noncovalent interaction in the absence of strand transfer. Commitment occurs only after double-strand cleavage at both transposon ends (in ""double-end break"" [DEB] complexes). Stable noncovalent DEB-target DNA cocomplexes can be detected, but no cocomplexes occur with synaptic complexes containing uncleaved ends. Preincubation of DEB complexes with target DNA accelerates the rate of strand transfer. Postcleavage target capture is remarkable for Tn10; Mu and Tn7 select a target site prior to cleavage. Promiscuous target selection may favor evolution of IS-based composite elements while being suicidal for other types of transposons."

When cyclin D1 expression was extinguished in these cells by gene knockout, specific alterations in their ability to transit the cell cycle were observed. These changes are exemplified by a delay of approximately 2 h in their progression through a normal 14-h cell cycle. This delay results in an increase in the number of cells in the G2/M phase population, most likely due to triggering of checkpoints in G2/M, inability to enter G1 normally, and/or alterations of crucial event(s) in early G1. The defect(s) in the cell cycle of these D1 “knockout” cells can be rescued by overexpression of any normal mouse D-type cyclin but not by a mutant mouse cyclin D1 protein that lacks the LXCXE motif at its amino terminus. These data suggest that the cell cycle alterations observed in the D1−/− cells are a direct effect of the absence of the cyclin D1 protein and support the hypothesis that the D-type cyclins have separate, but overlapping, functions. Elimination of cyclin D1 also resulted in enhanced sensitivity to radiation, resulting in a significant increase in apoptotic cells. Expression of any normal murine D-type cyclin in the D1−/− cells reversed this phenotype.

The genetic alterations that occur in this pathway during oncogenesis appear to involve many of its components, including the D-type cyclins, cyclin-dependent protein kinases (cdks), and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs). Unlike other G1 cyclins described thus far (e.g.cyclin C and cyclin E), the D-type cyclins are highly homologous to one another and their expression overlaps during G1 phase, suggesting that this group of cyclins may be somewhat redundant in their function. However, it has also been noted that not all D-type cyclins are expressed in each tissue, suggesting that their function may be linked to the specific tissues in which they are expressed. This particular cell cycle pathway is subject to a number of alterations during tumorigenesis, presumably due to its importance in response to mitogenic stimulation (31Khatib Z.A. Matsushime H.

The biologic role of multiple D-type cyclins has not yet been resolved. It has been established that each of the D-type cyclins contain a functional pRb-binding motif and that these cyclins are induced in response to mitogens in a cell lineage-specific manner (3Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 4Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar). However, cyclins D2 and D3 bind preferentially to pRb, whereas cyclin D1·pRb complexes are less stable (44Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J.-Y. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 45Dowdy S.F. Hinds P.W. Louis K. Reed S.I. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 499-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Microinjection of cyclin D1 antibodies and/or antisense oligonucleotides into normal human diploid fibroblasts, NIH3T3, and Rat-2 cells revealed that a sub-group of these cells could not enter S phase (46Baldin V. Lukas J. Marcote M.J. Pagano M. Draetta G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 812-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar, 47Quelle D.E. Ashmun R.A. Shurtleff S.A. Kato J.-Y. Bar-Sagi D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1559-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The ability of these microinjected cells to pass the restriction point and begin DNA replication was directly related to the time that had elapsed between the readdition of serum and microinjection of cyclin D1 antibodies or antisense oligonucleotides. Thus, by decreasing the level of functional cyclin D1 protein prior to the restriction point in late G1phase, the ability of these cells to progress through the cell cycle was impaired. These agents have no apparent effect on cell cycle once cells have passed the restriction point late in G1 phase of the cell cycle. Finally, it has been shown that ectopic expression of cyclin D1 inhibits MyoD and myogenin-mediated skeletal muscle differentiation indirectly (48Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine the role of cyclin D1 in muscle differentiation, experiments were designed to determine whether MyoD·myogenin and/or pRb were targets of cyclin D1·CDK phosphorylation. Mutation of CDK phosphorylation sites in myogenin had no effect on the ability of cyclin D1 to inhibit differentiation. Ectopic MyoD expression in fibroblasts can induce muscle-specific gene expression, as long as wild-type pRb is also expressed (48Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Kim P.S. Novitch B.G. Lassar A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7043-7053Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In pRb −/− fibroblasts expressing MyoD and a mutated pRb (which cannot be hyperphosphorylated), ectopic cyclin D1 expression continues to inhibit muscle-specific gene expression, whereas ectopically expressed cyclins A and E have no effect. These data suggest that the initiation of muscle-specific gene expression can be blocked by two distinct pathways, one of which is dependent on pRb hyperphosphorylation and the other is not. Several models of D-type cyclin function have been proposed based on the available data, but they all envision these cyclins as growth sensors (3Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar, 4Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2550) Google Scholar, 45Dowdy S.F.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The first model suggests that the D-type cyclins are tissue-specific regulatory subunits that are merely redundant in their function. A second model suggests that the functions of D-type cyclins are related to their sequential expression pattern during the cell cycle. More recent studies with cyclin D1 gene “knockouts” in mice have supported the former possibility (49Sicinski P. Donaher J.L. Parker S.B. Li T. Fazeli A. Garner H. Haslam S.Z. Bronson R.T. Elledge S.J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 621-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar, 50Fantl V. Stamp G. Andrews A. Rosewell I. Dickson C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2364-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Specifically, proper development of the retina and breast ductal epithelium was perturbed, suggesting that their normal maturation depends upon the presence of cyclin D1. This mouse model has provided significant insight into the requirements of cyclin D1 for normal development, but a specific requirement for this cyclin during cell cycle progression per se, has not been established. We now report the successful utilization of the chicken lymphoma B-cell line, DT40, to eliminate the expression of specific G1cyclins. This particular cell line undergoes gene-specific recombination at frequencies that are ∼100-fold higher than those in mouse embryonic stem cells (51Buerstedde J.M. Takeda S. Cell. 1991; 67: 179-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). DT40 cells provide a unique reagent to easily and quickly examine the necessity for each of these cyclins individually and collectively, as well as interactions between the various cyclins and other cell cycle proteins. These lymphoma B-cells normally express cyclin D1 and D2 but not cyclin D3. Elimination of cyclin D1 in DT40 cells is not lethal; however, ablation of cyclin D1 gene expression results in marked alterations in the ability of these cells to transit the cell cycle which, in turn, affects their normal growth rate. Furthermore, loss of cyclin D1 did not result in a compensatory increase in the levels of cyclin D2 in these cells. Overexpression of normal mouse cyclin D1, D2, or D3 in the D1 −/− cells restored normal growth and cell cycle progression. However, a mutant murine cyclin D1 lacking the LXCXE motif (the so-called retinoblastoma protein (pRb)-binding motif that enhances D-type cyclin interaction with pRb) did not rescue the D1 −/− phenotype (44Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J.-Y. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1993; 73: 487-497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 45Dowdy S.F. Hinds P.W. Louis K. Reed S.I. Arnold A. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 499-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Here we show that elimination of cyclin D1 leads to a specific cell cycle phenotype and that these cells can be rescued by expression of any one of the three murine D-type cyclins, but not by a murine cyclin D1 mutant missing the LXCXE motif. The rescue of the D1 −/− DT40 cells by murine cyclin D3 is somewhat intriguing, since avians do not express a cyclin D3 homologue in any cell line or tissue examined thus far (52, 53, and this study). Elimination of cyclin D1 in DT40 cells also resulted in a significant increase in apoptotic death following either UV or γ irradiation. Finally, expression of either murine cyclin D1, D2, or D3 in the DT40 D1−/− cells resulted in decreased sensitivity to radiation-induced apoptosis, indistinguishable to what was observed in the parental DT40 cell line. Expression of the mutant cyclin D1 partially rescued cells from radiation-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the mechanism(s) involving cyclin D1 in this pathway is distinct from its role in normal cell cycle progression. Thus, in avian B-lymphoma cells cyclin D1 appears to fully suppress apoptosis, whereas a mutant cyclin D1 partially rescued these cells, suggesting that the targets of cyclin D1·CDK activity in apoptotic cells may be distinct from those in proliferating cells.

Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Boehringer Mannheim or Southern Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin D1 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Charles Sherr (see Ref. 2Nurse P.

The DNA-specific dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Oligonucleotides for DNA sequencing were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA/RNA Synthesizer by the Molecular Resources Facility of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Cyclin D1 cDNAs were isolated from a UG9 T-cell cDNA library (55Gobel T.W.F. Chen C.H. Lahti J. Kubota T. Kuo C.-L. Aebersold R. Hood L.E. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1094-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) by low stringency hybridization with a human cyclin D1 cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Steve Reed (56Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of these cDNAs was determined as described previously (57Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were spaced approximately 80–100 base pairs apart spanning the entire cDNA. A full-length cyclin D1 cDNA was transcribed and translated in vitro, producing a 36-kDa protein that could be immunoprecipitated with the mouse polyclonal cyclin D1 antibody (see Fig. 4, panel A). The corresponding cyclin D1 (Gallus gallus ccnd1) gene was isolated by screening a Cornish White Rock chicken cosmid library (Stratagene) with the full-length cyclin D1 cDNA as described previously (58Li H. Grenet J. Kidd V.J. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 341-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). A 13-kb BamHI restriction fragment containing exons 1–3 of the cyclin D1 gene was subcloned into the pKS plasmid and either this DNA, or cosmid DNA, was used for double-strand DNA sequence analysis of the gene. The same oligonucleotides used for establishing the cDNA sequence were used to establish the molecular organization (intron/exon boundaries, exons) of the gene by sequencing the DNA strands in both directions. Genomic DNA was isolated as described previously (59Lahti J.M. Valentine M. Xiang J. Joens B. Amann J. Grenet J. Richmond G. Look A.T. Kidd V.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The constructs containing the inserted drug selection cassettes were made by digestion of the 13-kbBamHI subclone that contained exons 1–3 of theGgccnd1 gene, with the enzyme BstI that opened this fragment at a single site in exon 2 (Fig. 2, panel A). This exon encodes a major portion of the cyclin box region. Approximately 5.5 kb of genomic DNA were left intact on the 5′ side of this insertion, and approximately 7.5 kb of genomic DNA remained on the 3′ side. Restriction fragments containing either the neo orhyg gene under the control of a β-actin gene promoter (kindly provided by Dr. C. Thompson) were cloned into thisBstI site by blunt-end ligation using Klenow enzyme. Further details concerning the selectable marker genes can be found elsewhere (60Takeda S. Masteller E.L. Thompson C.B. Buerstedde J.-M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4023-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 61Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The integrity of the constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing, demonstrating that exon 2 was disrupted and that the remainder of the gene was intact. Homologous recombination of these constructs into the Gccnd1 locus of the DT40 cells was demonstrated by the increase in size of a 15-kb XbaI fragment that contains exons 1 and 2 of the gene but that also contains a unique 5′ region (5′-flanking probe) not found in the 13-kbBamHI subclone used for generating the disruption constructs (Fig. 2, panel A). This probe could then be used to analyze genomic DNA from single cell clones after XbaI digestion. Insertion of the neo cassette (2 kb in size) generated a 17-kb XbaI hybridizing fragment (Fig. 2, panels Cand D), and insertion of the hyg gene cassette (3 kb in size) generated an 18-kb XbaI hybridizing fragment (Fig. 2, panels C and D). DT40 lymphoma B cells (kindly provided by Dr. C-L. Chen) were grown in suspension cell culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine. pCycD1-neoand pCycD1-hyg were linearized and transfected into DT40 cells by electroporation (550 V, 25 microfarads). Twenty-four hours after DNA transfection, the appropriate concentration of selection drug (2 mg/ml G418 or 1.5 mg/ml hygromycin) was added to the culture medium, and the cells were selected for ∼14 days. Single cells, isolated by flow sorting, were expanded into individual clones. Genomic DNA was isolated from multiple single cell-derived clones, digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and hybridized with the cyclin D1 5′-flanking genomic probe (Fig. 2, panel A) to screen for homologous recombinants. Disruption of one, heterozygote (+/−), or both, homozygote (−/−), cyclin D1 (Ggccnd1) alleles was observed. For all experiments, multiple single cell clones of −/+ and −/− cyclin D1 disruptions were examined by both Southern and Northern blotting. RNA was isolated for Northern blotting, and the blots were hybridized to the cyclin D1 cDNA probe as described previously (57Xiang J. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15786-15794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,62Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Equal loading of RNA samples was verified by reprobing these blots with a human β-actin cDNA probe. The probes were prepared using a random labeling kit (Stratagene) as specified by the manufacturer. The blots were visualized by using a Molecular Dynamics 400A PhosphorImager. Exposure times were as follows: 12 h for the cyclin D1 cDNA, 2 h for the cyclin B2 cDNA, and 20 min for the β-actin cDNA. Cyclin D1 protein expression was examined by immunoprecipitation of [35S]methionine-labeled cell lysates using either mouse polyclonal cyclin D1, D2, or D3 antiserum as described previously by others (28Matsushime H. Ewen M.E. Strom D.K. Kato J.-Y. Hanks S.K. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 323-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). As controls for these experiments, the mouse preimmune sera were used in all experiments, and an appropriate unlabeled cyclin D-GST fusion protein was used as a competitor to demonstrate specificity of the various D-type cyclin immunoprecipitations in DT40 cells (Fig. 4, panel A). Cells were selected in 2 mg/ml G418 or 1.5 mg/ml hygromycin and then maintained in cell culture under continuous drug selection at the same concentrations. For the growth curves, 2 × 105 cells were plated in triplicate and grown in the presence of 10% serum. Each point represents the average of three determinations ± the standard error of the mean. Growth curves were obtained for each of the cell lines for 7 days at 1-day intervals. DT40 cells were synchronized by first using centrifugal elutriation to enrich the G1 phase population of cells. These cells were then blocked at the G1/S boundary using 25 mg/ml aphidicolin for 10 h. These synchronized cells were removed from the drug and then placed into culture media containing BudR, harvested at 2-h intervals, and replicating (BudR +) cells stained and counted. Cytospin slides were prepared and stained with an anti-BudR antibody and a fluorescein labeled secondary antibody according to the protocol from the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim). The cells were also stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and the number of metaphase cells was determined as well. For the BudR incorporation and mitotic index experiments, two separate clonal D1 −/− cell lines were examined (clones 1 and 3). For cell cycle analysis, asynchronously growing cells were stained with propidium iodide, and their DNA content was determined using the fluorescence activated cell sorter. This analysis was performed as described previously (62Lahti J.M. Xiang J. Heath L.S. Campana D. Kidd V.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) using asynchronously growing cultures by analyzing approximately 50,000 cells from polyclonal, or single cell, populations for each sample. The percentage of cells in each phase of the cell cycle was determined from the histograms using the MODFIT cell cycle analysis program. Rescue of the cyclin D1 −/− DT40 cells was accomplished by transfecting a clonal D1 −/− cell line (clone 1) with either a RSV-mouse CycD1 cDNA, RSV-mouse CycD2, RSV-mouse"
https://openalex.org/W2171811534,"In oocytes, nontranslated maternal mRNAs are packaged by protein into messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs) that are masked from translation by protein-RNA interactions. Proteins associated with such masked states of mRNAs are particularly abundant in amphibian oocytes. One of these mRNP proteins fromXenopus oocytes, mRNP3+4 (also called FRG Y2a/b or p54/p56), binds to diverse mRNAs independent of their sequence and is the germ line member of the evolutionarily conserved Y box protein multigene family. Xenopus oocytes contain soluble pools of mRNP3+4 6 S oligomers, probably dimers, and larger ∼15 S particles containing mRNP3+4 and additional proteins. Here we report the purification of this larger form as an ∼320-kDa particle that contains mRNP3+4 and nine additional polypeptides, including mRNA-binding polypeptides of 34 and 36 kDa and a doublet of 110/105 kDa that proved to be nucleolin. The particle has a protein kinase activity that phosphorylates its own mRNP3+4, nucleolin, and a 31-kDa polypeptide component and exhibits translational inhibition in both the wheat germ extract and rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems. The presence of mRNP3+4 and nucleolin in this large translation regulatory particle suggests that it participates in an early step of mRNP assembly and masking."

The localization of homocitrate synthase to the nucleus is unexpected given previous reports that homocitrate synthase is present in mitochondria and the cytoplasm in S. cerevisiae. In yeast, higher fungi, and euglenids, lysine is synthesized via the α-aminoadipate pathway, which is only found in these organisms (1Bhattacharjee J.K. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 12(2): 131-151Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Homocitrate synthase catalyzes the first committed reaction in this pathway and is thought to be an important site of control of metabolic flow. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, two isozymes have been identified by isoelectric focusing of purified enzyme preparations (2Tucci A.F. Ceci L.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Both isozymes are feedback inhibited by lysine, but only one is transcriptionally repressed by lysine (2Tucci A.F. Ceci L.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Genes for the homocitrate synthase isozymes have not been identified until recently, despite extensive genetic analyses of lysine auxotrophs, which have revealed most of the enzyme-encoding (LYS) genes required in this pathway.

Volckaert G. Yeast. 1997; 12: 1315-1320Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have disrupted this gene, examined the effects on lysine production and levels of homocitrate synthase enzymatic activity, and named this geneLYS20. The subcellular localization of enzymes of the α-aminoadipate pathway has been investigated in S. cerevisiae, and the enzymes for the first half of the pathway have been reported to be located in the mitochondrion (reviewed in Ref. 5Jones E.W.

We have generated four monoclonal antibodies against homocitrate synthase isozymes and present evidence that the majority of homocitrate synthase is localized to the nucleus in S. cerevisiae. As discussed below, this unexpected finding may be reconciled with previous results by consideration of the cell fractionation techniques used in previous studies. Thus, our findings extend previous cell fractionation studies and do not necessarily contradict them. The localization of homocitrate synthase to the nuclear compartment is likely to provide new insights into the α-aminoadipate pathway for lysine biosynthesis, and more generally, into aspects of nuclear function in S. cerevisiae. mAb 31F5 was generated during the preparation of monoclonal antibodies to a nucleolus-enriched fraction derived from yeast nuclei. 2Dove, J.

Balb/c mice were immunized with nucleoli suspended in RIBI adjuvant (Immunochem Research, Inc., Hamilton, MT), boosted on a regular schedule, and bled for analysis of the immune response by Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Spleen cells were harvested from the mouse with the most robust and complex immune response, and fused with NS myeloma cells, and plated in four media: (i) HCM (hybridoma complete medium, Ref. 10Siraganian R.P. Fox P.C. Berenstein E.H. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 92: 17-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) + 10% conditioned HCM; (ii) HCM + 10% conditioned HCM + origin supplement (Igen Inc., Gaithersburg, MD); (iii) HCM + 10% conditioned HCM + spleenocyte feeder; (iv) HCM + 10% conditioned HCM + spleenocyte feeder + origin supplement. Hybridomas in each medium were plated in 10, 96-well dishes to attain an average one colony per well. The yields of colonies from each medium were as follows: 17 colonies in medium i; 297 colonies in medium ii; 136 in medium iii; and 287 in medium iv. Wells were scored for the presence of one or more colonies at more than one time after fusion. Priority was given to single colonies. Supernatants (737) from 96-well plates were screened by immunofluorescence using a hexaploid yeast strain (Yeast Genetic Stock Center) and multiwell slides that were prepared in advance and stored dry at 4 °C until use. Clones (199) giving a nucleolar or nuclear staining pattern were expanded to 48-well plates, from which supernatants were screened by Western blotting. Of 199 supernatants that produced a nuclear staining pattern, 8 reacted with proteins of 45–50 kDa on Western blots. One of these, 31F5, was selected for further study. mAbs C65, D61, and D62 were generated in a screen for antinuclear antibodies that was described previously (11Aris J.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). mAb B47 recognizes Nsr1p, the nucleolar protein encoded by NSR1(12Lee W.-C. Xue Z.X. Melese T. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), based on results from screening a λgt11 library. 3T. Buber and J. P. Aris, unpublished results. All of the mAbs are IgG, isotype 1-κ. Cell fusion, hybridoma culture, and ascites fluid production were done using standard methods by the Hybridoma Laboratory of the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. SDS-PAGE in one dimension in 10.5% gels, transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, and incubations with antibodies were done as described previously (13de Beus E. Brockenbrough J.S. Hong B. Aris J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1799-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 14Hong B. Brockenbrough J.S. Wu P. Aris J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional gels, separation in the first dimension was done using nonequilibrium pH gradient electrophoresis (NEPHGE), followed by SDS-PAGE on 10.5% gels in the second dimension, as described previously (11Aris J.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The resolution of nuclear proteins (100 μg of total protein) was improved by digesting nucleic acids with 2 units of micrococcal nuclease for 10 min at 25 °C prior to NEPHGE. The protease-deficient haploid BJ2168 (15Jones E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 428-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and a W303 diploid were grown at 30 °C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) and were used for indirect immunofluorescence localization as described (13de Beus E. Brockenbrough J.S. Hong B. Aris J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1799-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Growth in synthetic dextrose or synthetic glycerol-lactate medium (synthetic base plus 1% glycerol and 1% lactate), with or without 100 μg/mll-lysine was done at 30 °C (16Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). Ascites fluids or mAb supernatants of 31F5, or C65, D61, and D62, were used at dilutions of 1/250 or 1/5, respectively. Secondary antibody anti-mouse-Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was diluted 1/200. A yeast genomic expression library in λgt11 (Clontech) was screened using standard techniques (17Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1996: 1-3Google Scholar), using mAb 31F5 ascites fluid at a dilution of 1/1000. Positive plaques were purified, and the insert DNA analyzed by direct PCR amplification of λ phage suspensions using primers flanking the EcoRI site. Of 25 positives analyzed by PCR, 8 had unique sized inserts. Five positives (#9, #15, #20, #25, and #39) were selected for further analysis on the basis of efficient amplification of a single PCR product band. DNA sequence from both ends of each of the six PCR products was obtained through the DNA Sequencing Laboratory of the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida. λ DNA was purified from #9 and the 2.6-kilobase pair insert was excised withEcoRI and cloned into pBluescript II KS+ to give plasmid pJPA50. The 2.6-kilobase pair PCR product from #20 was ligated into the TA site of the pT7-Blue vector to give plasmid pJPA72. E. coli DH5α was used for transformations and plasmid preparations (17Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing and Wiley-Interscience, New York1996: 1-3Google Scholar). Amino acid alignments were generated using the method of Lipman and Pearson (18Lipman D.J. Pearson W.R. Science. 1985; 227: 1435-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (2545) Google Scholar), as implemented by MacDNAsis software. The E. coli strain Y1089 was lysogenized with λ isolates #9 or #20, and induction of protein expression was accomplished with 1 mm IPTG in LB medium as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1-3Google Scholar). For SDS-PAGE, bacteria were treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, centrifuged, washed with 1% trichloroacetic acid, and lysed in the presence of 10% trichloroacetic acid with glass beads. After centrifugation, the pellet was boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing EDTA and a protease inhibitor mixture2 and centrifuged prior to electrophoresis. The S. cerevisiae strain BJ2168 was used for preparation of nuclei according to Ref. 20Aris J.P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. Cell fractions were obtained from different layers of a Ficoll 400 step gradient that is used in the final step of isolation of yeast nuclei and are virtually identical to those described in Ref. 13de Beus E. Brockenbrough J.S. Hong B. Aris J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1799-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Nuclear subfractionation was done according to Ref. 13de Beus E. Brockenbrough J.S. Hong B. Aris J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1799-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. During the preparation of monoclonal antibodies against nucleus- and nucleolus-enriched fractions from yeast, we identified four monoclonals that reacted with proteins of apparent molecular masses 47 and 49 kDa (Fig. 1). mAbs C65, D61, and D62 resulted from a screen for nuclear-specific monoclonal antibodies, whereas monoclonal 31F5 resulted from a screen for nucleolar-specific monoclonals (see “Experimental Procedures”). Isolated yeast nuclei are characterized by prominent SDS-PAGE bands corresponding to histones and the nucleolar protein Nop1p, whereas in nucleolar preparations, Nop1p is further enriched, but histones are depleted (Fig. 1). mAb 31F5 recognizes the 47- and 49-kDa proteins present in yeast nuclei and nucleoli prepared from isolated nuclei (Fig. 1). The band at 47 kDa appears to consist of a doublet of closely migrating bands. D61 recognizes the 47-kDa band, but the 49-kDa band only weakly. C65 reacts with the 47-kDa band, but does not recognize a 49-kDa band (Fig. 1), even after long exposures of the Western blot (not shown). Like mAb 31F5, D62 recognizes two pairs of closely migrating protein bands that have apparent molecular masses of 47 and 49 kDa (Fig. 1). The immunologic reactivities of mAbs 31F5 and D62 suggest the recognition of shared epitopes on related proteins. Results with C65 suggest monospecific immunoreactivity. The pattern of immunologic reactivity of mAb D61 appears distinct from the other three insofar as the epitope is recognized avidly in one protein, but to a reduced extent in the other. Also, 31F5 appears similar to D62. Three explanations for these findings are: (i) the existence of distinctly different proteins of similar molecular masses; (ii) the presence of one protein with multiple post-translational modifications, each of which is recognized by a mAb; or (iii) a combination in which two (or more) similar proteins share post-translational modifications. To compare the reactivities of the mAbs, nuclear proteins were separated on two-dimensional NEPHGE-SDS gels and probed by immunoblotting. NEPHGE was used in the first dimension instead of isoelectric focusing, because it gave better separation of immunoreactive proteins (data not shown). Interestingly, mAbs C65, D61, and D62 react with distinct, but overlapping, sets of proteins on two-dimensional gels (Fig. 2). D62 reacts with the largest number of proteins (Fig. 2 C). C65 and D61 each reacts with a smaller number of proteins, each of which appears to be recognized by D62 (Fig. 2, A and B). The detection of multiple proteins suggests the presence of different isoforms of the same mobility on SDS-PAGE gels. To assess the similarity of 31F5 and D62, immunoblots from two-dimensional gels were compared (Fig. 2, E andF). The patterns of reactivity appear identical, suggesting that 31F5 and D62 recognize the same epitope. The immunoblotting results from E. coli lysogens are consistent with this (see below and Fig. 5). These data suggest that the monoclonals fall into three classes of immunologic reactivity. To evaluate the intracellular distribution of the 47- and 49-kDa proteins, we performed indirect immunofluorescence localization using procedures described previously (13de Beus E. Brockenbrough J.S. Hong B. Aris J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1799-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence signals obtained with the mAbs were compared with staining with DAPI, which intercalates into DNA and marks the distribution of chromatin and mitochondrial DNA in the cell. All four monoclonal antibodies give a primarily, but not exclusively, nuclear immunofluorescence staining pattern (Fig. 3, A, D, G, and J). In certain dividing cells, mAb 31F5 reveals a faint trail of staining between nuclei, which corresponds to a narrow isthmus-like connection between nuclei in a dividing pair of cells at the end of mitosis (Fig. 3 A, upper right). This faint trail of staining also stains with DAPI. A faint cytosolic staining is visible, more in some cells than others, and is most readily seen with mAb C65 (Fig. 3 D). Staining with the secondary antibody alone is not responsible for this faint cytosolic signal (not shown). In some cases, the mAb staining patterns appear larger than the DAPI staining region of the cell. This is due to immunostaining within the nucleolus, which is not stained with DAPI. Images less bright than those shown in Fig. 3 reveal a punctate, intranuclear staining pattern throughout the nucleus (not shown). Fig. 3 shows results obtained with two yeast strains of different genetic backgrounds, a W303 diploid and a protease deficient strain BJ2168. Considering the intracellular localization of the 47- and 49-kDa proteins, it is not surprising that monoclonal antibodies prepared against isolated nuclei and nucleoli react with these proteins. To characterize the immunoreactivity of the monoclonal antibodies at a molecular level, we elected to screen a yeast expression library with one of the mAbs (see “Experimental Procedures”). mAb 31F5 was chosen for this because it, like D62, strongly recognized multiple proteins. Immunoscreening of a yeast expression library with mAb 31F5 yielded five independent full-length clones (Fig. 4 A). The insert from one positive clone, #9, was subcloned and sequenced in its entirety (see “Experimental Procedures,” DNA sequence not shown). The 2639 nucleotides of DNA sequence data obtained matched exactly the sequence on chromosome IV between 132,967 and 135,605 and contained the open reading frame YDL182w. This sequence has recently been shown to encode a homocitrate synthase isozyme and has been named LYS20 (4Ramos F. Verhasselt P. Feller A. Peeters P. Wach A. Dubois E. Volckaert G. Yeast. 1997; 12: 1315-1320Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Two additional positive clones, #15 and #25, were found to overlap with #9. Interestingly, two different positive clones, #20 and #39, carried the open reading frame YDL131w, between 227,393 and 228,715 on chromosome IV (Fig. 4 A). To our knowledge, the fact that positive clones #20 and #39 were isolated is the first evidence suggesting that the YDL131w ORF is expressed in yeast. The predicted product from the YDL131w ORF is highly homologous to Lys20p (Fig. 4 B).LYS20 is 1287 nucleotides in length, whereas the YDL131w ORF is 1323 nucleotides in length. Lys20p is 428 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of 47,096 and the homologue is predicted to have 440 amino acids and a molecular weight of 48,591. The predicted sizes of 47.1 and 48.6 kDa are essentially the same as the apparent molecular masses of 47 and 49 kDa observed on Western blots, although each gene product may not migrate as a single band on SDS gels. Lys20p and its homologue are 90% identical (over 428 positions). TheLYS20 gene is approximately 90% identical to YDL131w at the nucleotide level (over 1287 nucleotides). The predicted isoelectric points for Lys20p and its homologue YDL131w are 6.9 and 5.9, respectively. The two previously characterized homocitrate synthase isozymes have isoelectric points of 5.8 and 4.9, the more acidic of which is down-regulated in the presence of lysine (2Tucci A.F. Ceci L.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Prosite analyses of Lys20p and its homologue revealed the presence of multiple potential phosphorylation sites, but indicated that neither protein contained an amino-terminal mitochondrial presequence or a canonical nuclear localization sequence. We wished to show that 31F5 recognizes the products of theLYS20 and YDL131w genes carried on the inserts in clones #9 and #20, respectively, and not β-galactosidase fusion proteins. It is also valuable to demonstrate that these gene products migrate at 47 and 49 kDa as predicted by their primary structure. Also, considering that immunoscreening a yeast expression library yielded two classes of positives, and that certain mAbs react with a group of proteins on Western blots, only a subset of which were recognized by other mAbs, it is likely that not all of the mAbs recognize the same gene product. Thus, we wished to further characterize the immunoreactivity of the other three antibodies. λ lysogens were prepared for heterologous protein expression in E. coli, and Western blotting was done with mAbs C65, D61, D62, and 31F5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). A 47-kDa band was detected by mAb 31F5 in an extract from an IPTG-induced E. coli lysogen carrying the insert present in clone #9 (Fig. 5). This band exactly comigrates with the 47-kDa band present in samples of yeast nuclei. The 47-kDa band was not detected in an IPTG-induced extract from a lysogen carrying a clone for the putative acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase 2, 4S. Chen, J. E. Dove, J. S. Brockenbrough, and J. P. Aris, unpublished results. which was used as a control (Fig. 5). India ink staining of the blot reveals a band of 47 kDa present in samples from lysogen #9, but not from the control (data not shown). This argues that clone #9 was isolated during immunoscreening by virtue of the expression of the 47-kDa protein. In a similar experiment, a 49-kDa band was detected by mAb 31F5 in extracts from a lysogen carrying clone #20 (Fig. 6). The 49-kDa band exactly comigrates with the 49-kDa band present in yeast nuclei. The 49-kDa band was not detected in an IPTG-induced extract from E. coli strain Y1089 that was not lysogenized, which was used as a control (Fig. 6). Several immunoreactive proteins less than 49 kDa are also visible in Fig. 6. Two experiments with independently isolated lysogens of clone #20 yielded the same lower molecular mass immunoreactive bands. We attribute these bands to proteolysis of the 49-kDa YDL131w gene product. Proteolysis is not uncommon in SDS-PAGE lysates of induced lysogens and has apparently occurred despite precautions taken to reduce proteolysis during sample preparation (see “Experimental Procedures”). It was not possible to prepared IPTG-induced protein lysates from clone #39, which also carries YDL131w. Two independent lysogens of clone #39 spontaneously lysed during IPTG induction of protein expression in two separate experiments (data not shown). The results presented in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that mAb 31F5 does not detect a β-galactosidase fusion protein, which would be predicted to have a molecular mass greater than 116 kDa. The 47- and 49-kDa proteins expressed in E. coli also reacted with monoclonal D62 (Figs.5 and 6). C65 reacts with the 47-kDa protein expressed in E. coli, but not the 49-kDa protein, which is consistent with the reactivity of C65 against yeast nuclear proteins (Fig. 1). C65 also reacted with certain E. coli proteins in control samples, indicating nonspecific reactivity with the antibody (Fig. 5). Interestingly, D61 did not react with either Lys20p or the YDL131w gene product expressed in E. coli (Figs. 5 and 6), even after long exposures of film (data not shown). The absence of reaction of D61 could be due to the absence of formation of the necessary epitope inE. coli (e.g. absence of post-translational modification). Like 31F5, mAb D62 reacts with lower molecular mass bands from clones #9 and #20 (Figs. 5 and 6). The fact that same low molecular mass bands are recognized by 31F5 and D62 is consistent with the notion that 31F5 and D62 recognize the same epitope. The localization of homocitrate synthase to the nucleus contradicts previous studies that suggest cytosolic and/or mitochondrial localization. To generate additional evidence that homocitrate synthase is detected by the mAbs during immunolocalization, we performed the localization with cells grown in the presence or absence of lysine. Additionally, it is possible that the localization of homocitrate synthase is dependent on carbon source and/or presence of lysine. For instance, growth of yeast in YPD, which is routinely used for immunofluorescence localization, does not induce maximal proliferation of mitochondria, and YPD contains lysine, which is known to repress expression of one homocitrate synthase isoform (2Tucci A.F. Ceci L.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Growth in glycerol-lactate medium in the absence of lysine induces proliferation of mitochondria and expression of homocitrate synthase, which should provide the optimum conditions under which to detect mitochondrial localization. To test these possibilities, yeast were grown in dextrose or glycerol-lactate medium, with or without lysine and examined by immunofluorescence localization. Growth in either carbon source resulted in nuclear localization, with no apparent difference between them (Fig. 7). The presence of lysine, however, noticeably reduced the nuclear immunofluorescence staining intensity (Fig. 7). This reduction is most pronounced for C65, which reacts with Lys20p. The reduction seen with D61 is not as great. Immunofluorescence localization with 31F5 and D62 showed a lysine-dependent reduction in staining that appeared identical to that obtained with C65, and neither 31F5 or D62 showed evidence of cytosolic or mitochondrial staining (data not shown). DAPI staining of cells shown in Fig. 7 reveals a significant increase in number of mitochondria in cells grown on the synthetic glycerol-lactate nonfermentable carbon source (data not shown). The immunofluorescence intensity observed in Fig. 3, using cells cultured in YPD, appears intermediate between the intensity in cells grown with or without lysine in Fig. 7. To address the intracellular localization of the 47- and 49-kDa proteins with an additional technique, subcellular fractions were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 8). The fractions employed are: purified nuclei (Nu), low (L) and high (H) density membrane fractions, and a soluble (S) fraction. These fractions are harvested from a Ficoll 400 step gradient used to isolate nuclei from a spheroplast lysate (13de Beus E. Brockenbrough J.S. Hong B. Aris J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1799-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The spheroplast lysate is cleared of unlysed cells and cell wall debris by a medium speed centrifugation step. The vast majority of proteins present in the yeast cell are represented in these four fractions, although cell wall proteins were removed during spheroplast preparation. The mAbs C65 and D62 recognize 47- and 49-kDa proteins that are found predominately in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 8). D61 recognizes the 47-kDa isoform most highly enriched in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 8). mAb D61 also recognizes the 49-kDa protein, but only very weakly (as seen in Fig. 1). Some 47- and 49-kDa protein bands are present in the high density membrane fraction, which contains endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, some vacuolar membrane, and a small amount of nuclear fragments and nuclear envelope (20Aris J.P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The non-nuclear reactivity is most readily seen with mAb D62, but the majority of the 47- and 49-kDa proteins are found in the nuclear fraction. To provide a basis for comparison, three other mAbs were used: mAb D77 was used to detect the 38-kDa nucleolar protein Nop1p; mAb B47 was used to detect the 67-kDa nucleolar protein Nsr1p; and the mAb C56 was used to detect the 100-kDa integral plasma membrane protein Pma1p (Fig. 8). Nuclear fractionation experiments were undertaken to evaluate the intranuclear localization of the 47- and 49-kDa proteins (Fig.9). This approach is valuable because certain nuclear proteins exhibit a typical extraction behavior (13de Beus E. Brockenbrough J.S. Hong B. Aris J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1799-1813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For example, histones are extracted from nuclei by DNase I digestion and EDTA treatment, whereas the nucleolar proteins Nop1p and Nsr1p are not. Nop1p and Nsr1p are liberated by exposure to high salt. The three monoclonals, C65, D61, and D62, recognize 47- and 49-kDa proteins, less than half of which are released by DNase I digestion and EDTA (Fig. 9). The majority of the 47- and 49-kDa proteins are present in the pellet fraction (Fig. 9). Of this, the majority is released by exposure of the pellet to 0.5 m NaCl. Similar behavior is exhibited by the nucleolar proteins Nop1p and Nsr1p (Fig. 9). This suggests that the majority of the 47- and 49-kDa proteins present in the nucleus are not freely diffusible, and a significant portion are tightly bound and can only be extracted from nuclei with DNase digestion and high salt. We have generated four monoclonal antibodies specific for homocitrate synthase in yeast. Homocitrate synthase catalyzes the first committed step in the α-aminoadipate pathway for lysine biosynthesis. Recently, Ramos et al. (4Ramos F. Verhasselt P. Feller A. Peeters P. Wach A. Dubois E. Volckaert G. Yeast. 1997; 12: 1315-1320Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar) have characterized a gene (YDL182w) encoding an isozyme of homocitrate synthase and have named itLYS20. These four monoclonal antibodies, C65, D61, D62, and 31F5, recognize Lys20p, which migrates at 47 kDa. The mAbs D62, D61, and 31F5 also recognize the 49-kDa YDL131w gene product, but D61 does so only very weakly. The YDL131w gene product is predicted to be slightly larger than Lys20p and to possess an amino acid sequence 90% identical to Lys20p. Our studies using monoclonal antibodies have localized homocitrate synthase to the nucleus. Cell fractionation and immunfluorescence labeling experiments indicate that the majority of homocitrate synthase in yeast is present in the nucleus. The localization of homocitrate synthase to the nucleus is unexpected given the generally accepted view that homocitrate synthase is present in the mitochondrion and cytoplasm in S. cerevisiae (6Betterton H. Fjellstedt T. Matsuda M. Ogur M. Tate R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 170: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Tracy J.W. Kohlhaw G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1802-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). One explanation for this discrepancy is that a percentage of homocitrate synthase is not localized in the nucleus and accounts for the previous findings. This is consistent with the results reported herein insofar as we estimate that the majority, but not all, of homocitrate synthase is localized to the nucleus. However, we view it equally likely that previous studies were done in such a manner as to compromise the structural integrity of the nucleus. A widely cited report (6Betterton H. Fjellstedt T. Matsuda M. Ogur M. Tate R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 170: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) localizing homocitrate synthase to mitochondria is based on experiments in which mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation of a cell-free extract, which yields only a crude preparation. This was done under conditions that we have previously found to be incompatible with isolating intact nuclei from yeast (11Aris J.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Aris J.P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Specifically, Betterton et al. (6Betterton H. Fjellstedt T. Matsuda M. Ogur M. Tate R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 170: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) lysed spheroplasts in pH 7.4 buffer, without Mg2+, using sonication. We have found previously that isolation of intact nuclei in good yield requires pH 6.5, at least 1 mm Mg2+, and gentle lysis conditions (11Aris J.P. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 17-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Aris J.P. Blobel G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The “post-nuclear supernatant” obtained by Betterton et al. (6Betterton H. Fjellstedt T. Matsuda M. Ogur M. Tate R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 170: 459-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) using differential centrifugation, and the mitochondria obtained from it, are not likely to be free of nuclear fragments and/or constituents. The nuclear fractionation experiments presented herein show that a portion of homocitrate synthase does not freely diffuse out of the nucleus and appears to be associated with a sedimentable nuclear subfraction. This is consistent with the view that a crudely prepared “mitochondria” fraction may contain nuclear fragments. Thus, the observation that homocitrate synthase is present in the nucleus in S. cerevisiae may simply have been overlooked, because the techniques used in previous studies could not adequately differentiate between the mitochondrion and other compartments, such as the nucleus. Previous studies of homocitrate synthase and lysine biosynthesis have shown that two isoforms of this enzyme are present in S. cerevisiae (2Tucci A.F. Ceci L.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 742-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). LYS20 and its homologue YDL131w undoubtedly encode the two isozymes of homocitrate synthase present in yeast. Both the LYS20 gene and its homologue are located on chromosome IV, suggesting that they arose via gene duplication (24Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. in press, 1997Google Scholar). Neither Lys20p, nor the homologous protein, which contains an amino-terminal extension of 14 amino acids, is predicted to have an amino-terminal mitochondrial localization signal. Neither Lys20p, nor its homologue, is predicted to contain a nuclear localization sequence (NLS). This raises the question as to the mechanism by which homocitrate synthase is transported to the nucleus. The 47-kDa size of Lys20p is near the upper limit for diffusion across the nuclear pore complex, but could readily accumulate in the nucleus if bound to a nuclear component (21Feldherr C.M. Akin D. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 151: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Alternatively, nuclear transport of Lys20p may be explained either by “piggyback” transport in association with a nuclear protein, or the presence of an atypical NLS. The nuclear hnRNP A1 protein is a well known example of a protein lacking a typical NLS (22Siomi H. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Homocitrate synthase catalyzes the first committed step in the α-aminoadipate pathway for lysine biosynthesis. The following four steps of the pathway, from homocitrate to α-ketoadipate, are thought to be executed in the mitochondrion, and the next five steps, from α-aminoadipate to lysine, are thought to take place in the cytosol (1Bhattacharjee J.K. Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 12(2): 131-151Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5Jones E.W. Fink G.R. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R.

The localization of homocitrate synthase to the nucleus implicates the nucleus as an important intracellular compartment for this pathway and raises a number of questions. Is homocitrate synthase in the nucleus enzymatically active? What is the significance of nuclear localization for its catalytic activity? Are other enzymes of the α-aminoadipate pathway located in the nucleus? Does homocitrate synthase perform a function in the nucleus not directly related to lysine biogenesis? Perhaps homocitrate synthase plays a role in nuclear structure and/or function. The ILV5 gene product has been shown to be required for two distinct functions in mitochondria: branched chain amino acid synthesis and stabilization of mtDNA inheritance (23Zelenaya-Troitskaya O. Perlman P.S. Butow R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3268-3276Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Homocitrate synthase is an example of an enzyme in an unexpected location in the cell. The association of glycolytic enzymes with the cytoskeleton was also unexpected, but a significant consideration in understanding enzyme function (9Knull H.R. Walsh J.L. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1992; 33: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Evelyne Dubois graciously communicated unpublished results regarding LYS20.

https://openalex.org/W2027535185,"The ubiquitin-activating enzyme exists as two isoforms: E1a, localized predominantly in the nucleus, and E1b, localized in the cytoplasm. Previously we generated hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged cDNA constructs, HA1-E1 (epitope tag placed after the first methionine) and HA2-E1 (epitope tag placed after the second methionine) (Handley-Gearhart, P. M., Stephen, A. G., Trausch-Azar, J. S., Ciechanover, A., and Schwartz, A. L. (1994) J. Biol. Chem.269, 33171–33178), which represent the native isoforms. HA1-E1 is exclusively nuclear, whereas HA2-E1 is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. Using high resolution isoelectric focusing and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we confirm that these epitope-tagged constructs HA1-E1 and HA2-E1 represent the two isoforms E1a and E1b. HA1-E1/E1a exists as one non-phosphorylated and four phosphorylated forms, and HA2-E1/E1b exists as one predominant non-phosphorylated form and two minor phosphorylated forms. We demonstrate that the first 11 amino acids are essential for phosphorylation and exclusive nuclear localization of HA1-E1. Within this region are four serine residues and a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS; 5PLSKKRR). Removal of these four serine residues reduced phosphorylation levels by 60% but had no effect on nuclear localization of HA1-E1. Each serine residue was independently mutated to an alanine and analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis; only serine 4 was phosphorylated. Disruption of the basic amino acids within the NLS resulted in loss of exclusive nuclear localization and a 90–95% decrease in the phosphorylation of HA1-E1. This putative NLS was able to confer nuclear import on a non-nuclear protein in digitonin-permeabilized cells in a temperature- and ATP-dependent manner. Thus the predominant requirement for efficient phosphorylation of HA1-E1/E1a is a functional NLS, suggesting that E1a may be phosphorylated within the nucleus. The ubiquitin-activating enzyme exists as two isoforms: E1a, localized predominantly in the nucleus, and E1b, localized in the cytoplasm.

The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) 1The abbreviations used are: E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin-carrier enzyme; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; Cy3, indocarbocyanine; HA, influenza hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody epitope; IEF, isoelectric focusing; NLS, nuclear localization sequence; Ub, ubiquitin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; sulfo-SMCC, sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1carboxylate. catalyzes the first reaction in the ubiquitin (Ub) conjugation pathway. Activation of Ub occurs by the formation of a high energy thiol-ester bond between E1 and the C-terminal glycine of Ub and the production of AMP and PPi. Activated Ub is then transferred to a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (ubiquitin-carrier enzyme, E2). E2 proteins conjugate Ub directly to a target substrate or, alternatively, transfer Ub to a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3), which then conjugates Ub to a target protein (reviewed in Ref. 1Ciechanover A. Cell. 1994; 79: 13-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar and 2Hochstrasser M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Multiple rounds of Ub conjugation result in the rapid degradation of the target protein by the 26 S proteasome (3Croux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Recent published results, however, suggest ubiquitination plays an indirect role in protein degradation as well (reviewed in Ref. 4Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1996; 84: 813-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination on cell surface receptors such as Ste2 (5Hicke L. Riezman H.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3806-3812Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) triggers their endocytosis and degradation within the lysosome. Because Ub requires activation prior to participation in any subsequent reactions, E1 plays a key role in the Ub-conjugating pathway. E1 is localized in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (8Schwartz A.L. Trausch J.S. Ciechanover A. Slot J.W. Geuze H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate the nature of these isoforms, epitope-tagged cDNA constructs of E1 were generated where the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag was placed after the first methionine (amino acid 1; HA1-E1) or after the second methionine (amino acid 40; HA2-E1) (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HA1-E1 localized exclusively to the nucleus and displayed the same molecular weight as E1a, whereas HA2-E1 localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and displayed the same molecular weight as E1b (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the E1 isoforms are a result of alternate translational start sites. Of these isoforms, E1a/HA1-E1 is phosphorylated in vivo (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on a serine residue (12Cook J.C. Boon Chock P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3454-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), whereas E1b/HA2-E1 is not phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of E1a occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner (maximal in G2) and the resultant phosphorylated E1a was concentrated within nuclear extracts (13Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). On the basis of these observations, we proposed that an increase in phosphorylation of E1a functions to increase the import and/or retention of E1a in the nucleus (13Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The present study uses HA epitope-tagged cDNA constructs of E1 to identify amino acids that are important for nuclear localization and phosphorylation and whether phosphorylation of E1 is a prerequisite for its nuclear localization. We identify a specific serine residue that is phosphorylated in addition to a region of basic amino acids that is required for both nuclear localization and phosphorylation. Our data suggest that phosphorylation is not required for nuclear import, but that E1 may require a functional nuclear localization sequence for efficient phosphorylation. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% fetal calf serum and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber as described previously (9Trausch J.S. Grenfell S.J. Handley-Gearhart P.M. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C93-C102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfections were performed using a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described by Chen and Okayama (14Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar); cells were processed 40–48 h following transfection. HA1-E1, HA2-E1, and HA1-E1-del-11 constructs were described previously (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal deletion constructs, HA1-E1-del-4, HA1-E1-del-22, and HA1-E1-del-30, were constructed by annealing a primer encoding the HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYASG) and a 30-base overlap with the E1 sequence, beginning at amino acid 5, 23, or 31 (nucleotides 142, 196, or 220). The following point mutations (HA1-E1-S2A, HA1-E1-S3A, HA1-E1-S4A, and HA1-E1-S7A) were constructed using an HA-containing primer where serine 2, 3, 4, or 7 encoded within the 30-base overlap was replaced with an alanine (nucleotide 133, 136, 139, and 148). Using the same protocol, HA1-E1-R10A,R11A had lysines 10 and 11 replaced with alanines. HA1-E1-del-4,S7A, was constructed using an HA encoding primer with a 30-base pair overlap (which included a point mutation to change serine 7 to an alanine) beginning with amino acid 5. PCR products of the HA cDNA sequence attached to an 800-base fragment of E1 were generated using the HA-containing primers and a downstream E1 primer whose sequence included a unique NcoI site within the E1 sequence. PCR was performed using the Ericomp Twinblock thermocycler, andTaq DNA polymerase (Promega) with an annealing temperature of 55 °C. The human E1 cDNA in pGem7zf+ (E1pGem) was used as the template. PCR products were subcloned into the pCRII vector (TA cloning kit, Promega) and sequenced. Full-length E1 was constructed by replacement of a BamHI and NcoI fragment of E1pGem with the HA-E1 fragment generated by PCR. Full-length HA-E1 constructs were then subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). HA1-E1-del-8–11 was generated where the amino acids KKRR were removed using the Sculptor Mutagenesis kit (Amersham). All restriction enzymes were from Promega. HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid (ICN) as described previously (13Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.2% DTT containing 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm sodium fluoride. The lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min, then centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Protein concentrations of cleared lysates were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine serum albumin as standard. HA-tagged E1 was immunoprecipitated from radiolabeled extracts (200 μg of protein) using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody raised against the HA epitope tag, as described previously (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation buffer contained the following phosphatase inhibitors: 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 5 mm sodium fluoride. Samples were resolved on a 7.5% reducing gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose. HA-tagged E1 was visualized using the 12CA5 antibody, followed by a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoreactive proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham) and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Densitometer. The immunoblot was then exposed in a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager cassette, and the radiolabeled proteins were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm Optical Scanner. Immunofluorescence on transiently transfected HeLa cells was performed as described previously (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HA-tagged E1 was detected using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody followed by rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG preabsorbed against bovine, goat, horse, human, rabbit, and sheep serum proteins (Jackson). Peptides were synthesized (Washington University) and cross-linked to the non-nuclear protein bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Calbiochem) using sulfosuccinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (sulfo-SMCC, Pierce). This cross-links the N-terminal cysteine residue of the peptide to amino groups on the BSA. Sulfo-SMCC (1 mg/ml) was added at 20-fold molar excess to the BSA and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, excess sulfo-SMCC was removed using a Pharmacia PD10 column equilibrated in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Peptides with a reduced cysteine residue are added in a 50-fold molar excess to the activated BSA and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Free peptide was then removed using a Sephadex G50 column equilibrated in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The conjugated BSA was dialyzed overnight against 100 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.2. The dialyzed peptide-BSA conjugate was labeled with Cy3 (indocarbocyanine) using the Fluorolink kit from Amersham. Free Cy3 was removed using a Sephadex G50 column equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2. The Cy3-BSA peptide was stored at −80 °C. Cell permeabilization and subsequent nuclear import were based on the methods of Adam et al.(15Adam S.A. Sterne-Marr R. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown until they were subconfluent (18–36 h) on coverslips (15 mm × 15 mm). Cells were washed once with ice-cold import buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mmpotassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mmEGTA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 mm dithiothreitol). Cells were then permeabilized with import buffer containing 50 μg/ml digitonin (Sigma) for 5 min at 4 °C and washed three times with ice-cold import buffer. Coverslips were inverted on 50 μl of import mix (containing 50% (v/v) rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega), 2 μl of 20 mm ATP, 2 μl of 100 mm phosphocreatine, and 2 μl of 2 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 2 μl of 20 mg/ml ovalbumin, and 4 μl of Cy3-BSA peptide). Cells were incubated for 30 min at either 30 °C or 4 °C. For import in the absence of ATP, permeabilized cells were first depleted of ATP with 2 μl of 2000 units/ml apyrase for 1 h at 4 °C. Nuclear import was then performed as before except the ATP regenerating system in the import mix was replaced with apayrase. After import cells were rinsed twice with import buffer and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 4 °C and then washed with ice-cold import buffer. Samples were analyzed with an Olympus fluorescence microscope, and photographs were taken using a 50× oil objective and Tmax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed using Immobiline Drystrips, pH 4–7 (Pharmacia), and electrophoresed using the Multiphor II system (Pharmacia). HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine Tran35S-label (ICN) or [32P]orthophosphoric acid as described previously (13Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated E1 or HA-tagged E1 was eluted from Protein A beads with IEF sample buffer (9 m urea, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2% ampholytes, 1% DTT), loaded onto the Drystrip and focused for 3 h at 300 V and for 13 h at 2200 V. After the IEF run, the Drystrips were equilibrated in SDS buffer (0.125 m Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 4.9 mm DTT, pH 6.8) for 20 min. The dry strip was placed on a reducing 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel (18 × 16 cm) and electrophoresed for 5 h at 40 mA as the second dimension. The gel was fixed for 30 min and fluoroenhanced in Amplify (Amersham). The dried gel was then exposed to film for autoradiography at −80 °C. Two-dimensional gels were analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics Storm Optical Scanner. HeLa cells metabolically labeled with either [32P]orthophosphoric acid or Tran35S-label were lysed as described above but without the addition of phosphatase inhibitors. Lysate was then dialyzed overnight into 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Dialyzed 32P- or35S-labeled lysate (300 μg of protein) was incubated with 1 unit of potato acid phosphatase (Sigma) in 100 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.8, 10 mm MgCl2 overnight at 4 °C (final volume of 80 μl). The following day another 1 unit of phosphatase was added and incubated for 2 h at ambient temperature. Parallel incubations were included without the addition of phosphatase. E1 was immunoprecipitated from the lysate as described previously (13Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled E1 was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and E1 was visualized by an anti-E1 polyclonal antibody. 35S-Labeled E1 was immunoprecipitated and resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (as described previously). E1 exists as two isoforms E1a (117 kDa) and E1b (110 kDa). Previously we prepared E1 cDNA constructs in which an HA-epitope tag was placed after the first methionine (HA1-E1) or the second methionine (HA2-E1) (Fig. 1 A; Ref. 11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HA1-E1 and HA2-E1 were similar in their molecular weight and phosphorylation state to E1a and E1b, respectively (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of E1 from Chinese hamster (ts20) cells resolved E1 into the two isoforms E1a and E1b; E1a resolved further as three phosphorylated and one non-phosphorylated forms, whereas E1b resolved as one non-phosphorylated form (13Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To further determine the relationship between human E1, HA1-E1, and HA2-E1, we analyzed these species by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. HeLa cells were metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label or [32P]orthophosphoric acid, and human E1 was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody raised against human E1 (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells transiently transfected with HA1-E1 or HA2-E1 were metabolically labeled with Tran35S-label or [32P]orthophosphoric acid; HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the epitope tag (12CA5). Immunoprecipitated proteins were then resolved in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing, followed by SDS-PAGE in the second dimension (Fig. 1). 35S-Labeled human E1 migrated to its predicted isoelectric point of 5.7, but rather surprisingly E1a resolved as five spots and E1b resolved as three spots (Fig. 1 B). In addition to these predominant spots, other less abundant species which migrated toward the anode could be detected (Fig. 1 B). When human E1 was labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid, E1a resolved as four spots; however, no phosphorylation was observed for E1b (Fig.1 B). This is distinct from our previous observations withhamster E1 (13Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We attribute these differences to the better resolving capabilities of our isoelectric focusing used in this study. Previously IEF was performed with 1.5-mm rod gels; however, in this study Pharmacia Immobiline Drystrips were used, in which the Drystrips contain a preformed immobilized and non-drifting pH gradient, which can be electrophoresed at much higher voltages and results in superior resolution. These differences were not due to cell type as separation of hamster E1 using this method generated the same pattern of spots (data not shown). The epitope-tagged forms of E1 migrated to the same isoelectric point as the wild type protein (Fig. 1 C). 35S-Labeled HA1-E1 resolved as five main spots (0, −1, −2, −3, and −4), consistent with our observations of E1a. 35S-Labeled HA2-E1 resolved as three predominant spots (−1, 0, and 1), this pattern was very similar to that of E1b. 32P-Labeled HA1-E1 resolved as four distinct spots (Fig. 1 C; spots −1, −2, −3, and −4) in a pattern similar to E1a. 32P-Labeled HA2-E1 resolved as two spots (−1 and −2); however, these were only visible with extended exposures (Fig. 1 C; approximately 8 times longer than for HA1-E1). These species are not very abundant; for instance spot 2 could not be detected when labeled with Tran35S-label (Fig.1 C) and spot −1 only represents 2.5% of the total HA2-E1. These phosphorylated forms were not detected in E1b because they are present at levels too low to detect. In addition to the phosphorylated forms of HA1-E1/E1a and HA2-E1/E1b, there are also some spots that migrate toward the anode (spots 1 and 2); these species probably represent alternative charged forms. The pattern of spots for both HA1-E1 and HA2-E1 is essentially identical to E1a and E1b and is consistent with our hypothesis that the two E1 isoforms result from alternate translational start sites at the first and second in-frame methionines in the E1 sequence. These results also demonstrate that addition of the HA epitope tag to E1 did not alter its phosphorylation state. To further confirm our observations, we dephosphorylated human E1 by treatment with potato acid phosphatase. Dephosphorylated35S-labeled E1a resolved as a pattern of spots similar to E1b; it was found predominantly as spot 0 with minor species migrating as spot −1, 1, and 2 (data not shown). There was very little change in the pattern of 35S-labeled E1b spots after dephosphorylation; only a slight decrease in spot −1 was observed. Taken together, these data suggest that HA1-E1/E1a exists predominantly as four phosphorylated and a non-phosphorylated form; HA2-E1/E1b exists as two minor phosphorylated forms and as a predominant non-phosphorylated form. Furthermore, in addition to the phosphorylated forms, both HA1-E1/E1a and HA2-E1/E1b can be resolved into other non-phosphorylated charged species. A relatively abundant species (spot 1) is detected in 35S-labeled HA2-E1/E1b preparations, although the precise nature of these charged variants is currently not known. We and others have previously demonstrated that E1a/HA1-E1 are phosphorylated, whereas no detectable phosphorylation has been demonstrated for E1b/HA2-E1 (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15608-15614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, in our current study it appears that HA2-E1/E1b is phosphorylated but at levels approximately 100-fold less than HA1-E1/E1a (Fig. 1). Others have recently determined that E1 is only phosphorylated on serine residues (12Cook J.C. Boon Chock P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3454-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As HA1-E1 is 40 amino acids longer than HA2-E1, it is tempting to speculate that this region at the N terminus contains the predominantly phosphorylated serine residues. Within this 40 amino acid region, there 10 serine residues. Thus, to identify which serines are involved in phosphorylation of HA1-E1, a series of N-terminal truncation mutants were generated (Fig. 2 A). Constructs were made where the HA epitope was attached to the N-terminal region of E1 to create proteins that were truncated in segments of about 10 amino acids (Fig. 2 A). These HA-tagged E1 truncation mutants were transiently expressed in HeLa cells and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid. HA-tagged constructs were then immunoprecipitated using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. The total amount of immunoreactive HA-tagged construct was determined by immunoblot using the 12CA5 antibody (Fig. 2 B). The nitrocellulose was subjected to autoradiography to determine the 32P incorporation (Fig. 2 B). Removal of the first 11 amino acids of the E1 sequence (HA1-E1-del-11) resulted in no detectable phosphorylation. Removal of 22 (HA1-E1-del-22), 30 (HA1-E1-del-30), and 40 amino acids (HA2-E1) at the N terminus also resulted in no detectable phosphorylation of the HA-tagged constructs. These data thus suggest the first 11 amino acids contain residues that are essential for efficient phosphorylation of HA1-E1/E1a. Phosphorylation of certain proteins correlates with their retention in either the nucleus or cytoplasm (reviewed in Ref. 16Jans D.A. Hubner S. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 651-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For example SWI5 is excluded from the nucleus when phosphorylated (17Jans D.A.. Moll T. Nasmyth K. Jans P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17064-17067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas STAT-3 is translocated to the nucleus after phosphorylation (18Ruff-Jamison S. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Chen K. Darnell J.E. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21933-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed this is the case with E1; HA1-E1 is localized exclusively in the nucleus and phosphorylated, whereas HA2-E1 is found almost exclusively in the cytoplasm and is phosphorylated approximately 100-fold less than HA1-E1 (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously we have determined the subcellular localization of HA1-E1-del-11 by immunofluorescence using the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the first 11 amino acids resulted in predominant cytoplasmic staining with both positive and negative nuclear staining, as was also observed with HA2-E1 (11Handley-Gearhart P.M. Stephen A.G. Trausch-Azar J.S. Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33171-33178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus determined the immunofluorescent localization of the HA-tagged E1 truncation mutants, HA1-E1-del-22 and HA1-E1-del-30. These constructs were localized with the same distribution as HA1-E1-del-11 (data not shown). Therefore, in addition to amino acids essential for phosphorylation, the first 11 amino acids also contains residues necessary for the exclusive nuclear localization of HA1-E1. The first 11 amino acids of the E1 sequence contains, in addition to serines 2, 3, 4, and 7, a putative nuclear localization sequence (NLS),5PLSKKRR11. To determine which residues are responsible for phosphorylation or for nuclear localization, two additional HA-tagged E1 constructs were prepared: HA1-E1-del-7, where the first 7 amino acids (including serines 2, 3, 4, and 7) were removed, and HA1-E1-del-8–11, where the basic region of t"

To identify regions involved in the coassembly of these subunits, truncated Kir3.1 polypeptides were coexpressed with epitope-tagged subunits in an in vitro translation system. N-terminal, C-terminal, and core region polypeptides were coimmunoprecipitated with both Kir3.2 and Kir3.1, suggesting that multiple elements distributed throughout the Kir3.1 polypeptide contribute to intersubunit binding interactions. The Kir3.2 C-terminal polypeptide coimmunoprecipitated with the Kir3.1 C-terminal polypeptide, but neither region recognized the N-terminal domain and core region of the Kir3.1 subunit. This suggests that within Kir3 channels the C-terminal domains of neighboring subunits interact. Coexpression of the truncated polypeptides with Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 in Xenopus oocytes reduced functional expression of the heteromeric channels. Constructs encoding the core region plus N-terminal and proximal C-terminal regions competed more effectively than the core region alone, which supports the contribution of all three regions to intersubunit binding interactions. Proximal and distal segments of the C-terminal domain were as effective at inhibiting functional expression as the entire C-terminal domain. Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 associate to form G-protein-activated, inwardly rectifying K+ channels.

Potassium-selective ion channels are the most functionally diverse group of ion channels. Molecular cloning has revealed two major families: the voltage-gated channels (Kvs) with six putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; NAB, N-terminal A and B box; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: TMD, transmembrane domain; NAB, N-terminal A and B box; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. and the inwardly rectifying channels (Kirs), with two putative TMDs. Voltage-gated K+ channels have a tetrameric arrangement of Kv subunits contributing to a central conductance pore (1MacKinnon R.

Channel diversity is increased by the ability of different subunits to heteromultimerize to form channels with functional properties that differ from those of the homomeric channels (3Christie M.J.

The number of subunits composing a functional channel has been suggested to be four (9Glowatzki E. Fakler G. Brandle U. Rexhausen U. Zenner H.P. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Proc. R. Soc. Lond.

Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) have reported that Kir3 channel complexes, immunoprecipitated from atrial myocytes, can be much larger than would be predicted for a tetramer. The two families of channel subunits are further divided into subfamilies on the basis of amino acid sequence similarity (14Chandy K.G. Gutman G.A. Trends Pharmacol.

Salkoff L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 763-773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), although there are a few examples where subunits from different subfamilies have been shown to associate in heterologous expression systems (19Hugnot J.P.

An important determinant of subfamily-selective associations is a region within the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of the Kv subunits (2Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

It has been named the N-terminal A and B box (NAB), according to the nomenclature of Drewe et al. (23Drewe J.A. Verma S. Frech G. Joho R.H. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 538-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and is highly conserved within subfamilies. Heteromultimerization of Kir subunits has been shown to occur both within and between subfamilies in heterologous expression systems (9Glowatzki E. Fakler G. Brandle U. Rexhausen U. Zenner H.P.

Studies with chimeric channels have suggested that the N-terminal domains and core regions of Kir subunits may be involved in this process. Fink et al. (25Fink M. Duprat F. Heurteaux C. Lesage F. Romey G. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have shown that substituting the N-terminal domain of Kir3.2 for that of Kir2.3 promotes the coassembly of these two subunits. Tucker et al.(24Tucker S.J. Bond C.T. Herson P. Pessia M. Adelman J.P. J. Biol.

Kir3 channels couple to G-protein-linked receptors and are activated by a direct interaction with G-protein βγ-subunits. Several Kir3 channel subunits have been cloned from mammalian heart and brain (13Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E.

Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The neuronal channels are thought to be formed from Kir3.2 and Kir3.1, both of which are expressed in several areas of the central nervous system (28Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E.

Members of the Kir3 subfamily produce relatively small, G-protein-activated currents when expressed individually inXenopus oocytes. However, the coexpression of Kir3.1 with either Kir3.4 or Kir3.2 produces much larger inwardly rectifying K+ currents (13Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) showed that Kir3.1, expressed alone, coassembles with an endogenous oocyte subunit, Kir3.5, to form a functional channel. Immunofluorescence labeling of Kir3.1 subunits showed no detectable expression at the surface of oocytes injected with Kir3.1 cRNA alone and high expression at the surface of oocytes coinjected with Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 cRNAs. 2E. B. Stevens, R. Woodward, I. H. M. Ho, and R. D. Murrell-Lagnado, manuscript submitted. 2E. B. Stevens, R. Woodward, I. H. M. Ho, and R. D. Murrell-Lagnado, manuscript submitted. This suggests that Kir3.1 homomeric complexes either are not formed or are not targeted to the plasma membrane. A recent study by Kennedy et al. (35Kennedy M.E. Nemec J. Clapham D.E. Neuropharmacol. 1996; 35: 831-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) has shown that Kir3.1 expressed in COS cells is localized to internal cytoskeletal structures. In contrast, oocytes injected with Kir3.2 cRNA alone showed similar immunofluorescence labeling of Kir3.2 compared with the coinjected oocytes,2 suggesting that Kir3.2 homomeric channels are assembled and delivered to the plasma membrane with relative efficiency. We have investigated the structural elements in Kir3 channels that are involved in the coassembly of subunits. This was approached by coexpressing truncated Kir3.1 polypeptides with full-length Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 subunits in an in vitro system and inXenopus oocytes. N-terminal, C-terminal, and core region polypeptides were coimmunoprecipitated with the full-length subunits and were able to inhibit functional expression of heteromeric channels. This suggests that these elements of Kir3 channels all contribute to intersubunit binding interactions. Standard PCR procedures were used to construct a strong Kozak consensus sequence (36Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44 (,): 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3537) Google Scholar), GCCGCCACC, immediately upstream of the ATG initiation codon in cDNA clones for Kir3.1, Kir3.2, and Kir3.4. These constructs were then subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pBG7.2 vector (gift from R. W. Aldrich), which provides the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of theXenopus β-globin gene. In addition, a FLAG tag sequence corresponding to the amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDK was added to the extreme N terminus of Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 using standard PCR procedures. The cDNA for Kir3.1 was subdivided into three portions, encoding the N terminus (1–85), the core region (77–190), and the C terminus (180–501), using standard PCR procedures. An additional construct was made by PCR, which added residues 60–80 of Kir2.1 to the Kir3.1 region 80–190 by incorporation of the corresponding Kir2.1 sequence into the 5′ PCR primer. PCR reactions were performed with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of all PCR-generated clones were verified using dideoxy-DNA sequencing using the Sequenase II enzyme (U.S. Biochemistry Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A further series of deletion clones were made in the Kir3.1 cDNA using a nested deletion strategy, gradually deleting more DNA from the 3′-end of the open reading frame. A linker sequence flanked byKpnI and BstEII sites that had internal TAG stop signals in each of the three reading frames was introduced into the pBG7.2Kir3.1 multiple cloning site after the native stop codon.NotI- and KpnI-linearized DNA generated suitable ends for unidirectional nested deletion library construction. A library of random length deletion clones was generated using the Exo-Size kit (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against peptides derived from unique sequences in Kir3.1, at the N terminus (amino acids 5–20) and at the C terminus (amino acids 485–499). Both sequences had an additional cysteine residue added to the C-terminal end to facilitate covalent linkage to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the m-maleimidobenzoic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester method (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.8-18.9Google Scholar). Full-length and truncated construct plasmid cDNAs were coexpressed in the TNT coupled transcription/translation system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's instructions, in the presence of translation grade [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.) and either in the presence or absence of canine pancreatic microsomes. Twenty-four microliters of the translation mix was solubilized with 200 μl of solubilization buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) on ice for 30 min, and the soluble lysate was then incubated on ice for 15 min with 10 μl of protein G-coated Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The beads were cleared, and the supernatant was incubated with either 150 ng of anti-FLAG monoclonal antiserum (IBI Kodak) or a 1:2000 dilution of anti-Kir3.1 polyclonal antisera for 1 h on ice. 20 μl of a slurry of 50% protein G-coated Sepharose beads was then added, and the incubation continued for 1 h. Immunoprecipitated material was sedimented by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 s and washed four times in 800 μl of solubilization buffer at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer (38Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204929) Google Scholar) and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography of the dried gels. SDS-PAGE gels of 35S-labeled translation products were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen overnight. A densitometric analysis of the amounts of labeled polypeptides was made on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager using the ImageQuant software. Capped cRNA was made fromNdeI-linearized cDNA using the T7 polymerase mMESSAGE mMACHINE Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Oocytes were surgically removed from Xenopus laevis anesthetized with 3-amino benzoic acid (Sigma) and dissociated from connective tissue using 0.3% collagenase (Sigma) in Ca2+-free buffer (82.5 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.6). Isolated oocytes were microinjected with 50-nl cRNAs dissolved in water. Spectroscopic determinations of cRNA concentrations indicated that undiluted cRNAs were between 30 and 50 ng/50 nl. In all experiments, the human M2-muscarinic receptor cRNA was coinjected. Oocytes were incubated in ND96 at 18 °C. Two electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed 3–6 days after microinjection using an OC-725B amplifier (Warner Instruments), interfaced to a Macintosh Quadra 700 computer using an ITC16 A/D board (Instrutech) with pulse acquisition software (version 7.89; HEKA). Microelectrodes filled with 3m KCl had resistances ranging between 0.5 and 2 megaohms. Oocytes were continuously perfused with standard recording solution (90 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). Currents were recorded in the presence of 10 μmacetylcholine before and after application of 300 μmBa2+. Current records were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 5 kHz. Experiments were done at room temperature (22–24 °C). Oocytes were microinjected with 50 nl of cRNAs and incubated at 18 °C in ND 96 for 5–6 days. Batches of 8–10 oocytes were fixed for 4 h in methanol at −20 °C and cryopreserved in PBS, pH 7.4, 30% (w/v) sucrose at 4 °C overnight. Oocytes were then embedded in octyltransferase (Gurr) on cryostat chucks sitting on dry ice. 16-μm slices were cut on a Leica CM3000 cryostat, and the sections were mounted onto poly-d-lysine-coated microscope slides and left to air-dry. Slices were then blocked in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight. Samples were incubated in primary antiserum diluted 1:500 in PBS, pH 7.4, plus 1% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C and then washed with several changes of PBS. They were then incubated for 1 h with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antiserum (Vector) at room temperature. Following a series of washes in PBS, the samples were mounted in DPX medium (BDH) and left to dry in the dark. Samples were viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot UV microscope using a × 20 objective. Statistical analyses were performed with a unpaired Student's t test using InStat software (version 2.01, GraphPad). Data were assumed to be normally distributed. A significant difference was accepted when the two-tailed pvalue was less than 0.01. Averaged data were presented as mean ± S.E. Different members of the Kir3 family that were cotranslatedin vitro in the presence of microsomal membranes were shown to associate by the coimmunoprecipitation of both subunits using antiserum that recognized only one of the subunits (Fig.1). The subunit specifically precipitated contained a FLAG epitope added to the N terminus. This did not alter the functional characteristics of the channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes (results not shown), suggesting that it does not interfere with the coassembly of subunits. Kir3.1 gave two products, a 56-kDa species and a 58-kDa glycosylated species, whereas Kir3.2 and Kir3.4 both gave a single product of molecular size 54 and 47 kDa, respectively. Fig. 1shows the coprecipitation of Kir3.1 with FLAG-Kir3.2 and the coprecipitation of Kir3.4 with both FLAG-Kir3.1 and FLAG-Kir3.2. To investigate which regions of Kir3.1 are involved in subunit coassembly, we made a series of truncated constructs with progressively larger deletions from the C terminus (Fig.2 A) and tested their ability to coprecipitate with full-length subunits containing the FLAG epitope. We looked at binding to both Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 to see if we could identify structural elements that distinguish heteromultimerization from Kir3.1 homomultimerization, and the results are shown in Fig. 2 B. The polypeptides 1–347, 1–200, and 1–160, which have the distal half of the C-terminal domain, almost the entire C-terminal domain, and the C-terminal domain plus TMD2 deleted, respectively, were all coprecipitated by full-length Kir3.1 and Kir3.2. All three constructs gave two products, the glycosylated and unglycosylated species, indicating that these polypeptides incorporated into the microsomal membranes. The N-terminal segment, Kir3.1-(1–85), which has the entire core region and C-terminal domain deleted, did not appear to coprecipitate with either Kir3.1 or Kir3.2 (results not shown). This region contains just a single methionine and consequently would only produce a very weak fluorographic signal. We therefore added a FLAG epitope to the 1–85 construct and tested the ability of the full-length subunits without the FLAG epitope to coprecipitate with this segment. In the absence of microsomal membranes, both Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 coprecipitated with Kir3.1-(1–85). However, when microsomes were included in the translation mixture we were unable to detect coprecipitation of either subunit (results not shown). One possible explanation for this difference is that the presence of membranes favors associations between the membrane-incorporated full-length subunits while reducing the rate of encounter between the soluble Kir3.1-(1–85) peptide and the subunits. We next tested the ability of the core and C-terminal segments to bind to Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 subunits. Kir3.1-(77–190) starts a few residues upstream of the proposed TMD1 and includes H5 and TMD2. When translated in the presence or absence of microsomal membranes, this construct gave only a single product of molecular size 15 kDa, which was not coprecipitated with either Kir3.1 or Kir3.2 (Fig. 2 C). The lack of a detectable glycosylated species suggests that the Kir3.1-(77–190) polypeptide did not incorporate correctly into the microsomal membranes. In the absence or presence of microsomes, the polypeptide was sedimented by spinning the translation mixture at 100,000 × g for 10 min, suggesting that it forms insoluble aggregates (results not shown). To obtain a polypeptide that included only the core region of the Kir3.1 subunit but had sufficient residues upstream of TMD1 to incorporate into membranes, we made a chimeric construct encoding residues 60–80 of Kir2.1 and residues 80–190 of Kir3.1 (Kir3.1-(∼80–190)). This gave both a glycosylated and unglycosylated product, which were coprecipitated with Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 (Fig. 2 C). This suggests that the core region of Kir3.1 recognizes and binds to the full-length subunits, although we cannot rule out an involvement of the 20 Kir2.1 residues. Kir2.1 has been reported not to readily associate with Kir3.1 in theXenopus oocyte expression system (39Kubo Y. Iizuka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We found that coinjecting an excess of Kir3.1 cRNA with Kir2.1 cRNA, reduced the functional expression of Kir2.1 (results not shown), suggesting that there is some recognition between the two subunits. The 35-kDa C-terminal domain (Kir3.1-(180–501)) coprecipitated with both Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 in the presence and absence of microsomal membranes. The constructs Kir3.1-(180–307) and Kir3.1-(308–501) divide up the C-terminal domain at the start of a region showing some sequence similarity to pleckstrin homology domains (40Reuveny E. Slesinger P.A. Inglese J. Morales J.M. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Bourned H.R. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 143-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Such domains are found in proteins that may interact with Gβγ-subunits (41Musacchio A. Gibson T. Rice P. Thompson J. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Both polypeptides were individually coprecipitated with the full-length subunits and particularly effectively with Kir3.1. These results suggest that regions involved in subunit coassembly are distributed throughout the Kir3.1 polypeptide, within the proximal and distal segments of the C-terminal domain, the core region and possibly also the N-terminal domain. All regions recognized both Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 subunits and there was no evidence to suggest that any part of the Kir3.1 polypeptide inhibits its homomultimerization. A densitometric scan of gels provided a quantitative analysis of the relative amounts of each product in the translation reactions and in the immunoprecipitates. Representative scans of immunoprecipitated products are shown in Fig. 3, the top rowshowing truncated proteins coprecipitated with Kir3.1 and thebottom row showing proteins precipitated with Kir3.2. Whereas Kir3.1-(1–160) and Kir3.1-(1–347) appear to coprecipitate to a similar extent with both Kir3.1 and Kir3.2, there is clearly very much more Kir3.1-(308–501) coprecipitated with Kir3.1 compared with Kir3.2. Correcting for the number of methionines in each polypeptide, the relative amounts of each construct polypeptide in the immunoprecipitates and corresponding translation reactions, expressed as a percentage of the total product, are given in TableI. The amount of construct coprecipitated per mol of Kir3.1 or Kir3.2 was dependent upon its proportion in the translation reaction. For Kir3.1-(1–347), a 6:1 molar ratio of construct to full-length subunit gave a maximal amount of construct polypeptide in the precipitate. We therefore aimed to achieve at least this molar ratio in all cotranslation reactions, although Kir3.1-(180–501) was translated relatively inefficiently and lower ratios were obtained. This low translation efficiency may explain why the amount of the C-terminal domain coprecipitated with either subunit was low compared with the amount of constructs 180–307 and 308–501 coprecipitated. The polypeptides containing regions within the C-terminal domain of Kir3.1 or Kir3.2 were all coprecipitated in significantly higher amounts with Kir3.1 than with Kir3.2, whereas there was no significant difference for the other polypeptides. This suggests that the relative contribution of the C-terminal domain to the overall intersubunit binding interaction is different for Kir3.1 homomeric complexes than for heteromeric complexes.Table IRelative amounts of truncated Kir3.1 polypeptides coprecipitated with Kir3.1 and Kir3.2Truncation constructKir3.1Kir3.2Construct in reactionConstruct in immunoprecipitateConstruct in reactionConstruct in immunoprecipitate%%Kir3.1-(1–347)318.6313.4Kir3.1-(1–347)7032.47913.8Kir3.1-(1–347)8543.38919.4Kir3.1-(1–347)9942.09921.3Kir3.1-(1–160)96 ± 4.833.5 ± 6.996.1 ± 4.130.0 ± 6.5Kir3.1-(1–200)79.5 ± 2.527.0 ± 9.385.3 ± 7.317.8 ± 5.4Kir3.1-(∼80–190)93.3 ± 3.816.7 ± 0.686.3 ± 1.214.8 ± 3.0Kir3.1-(1–347)90.1 ± 4.647.2 ± 7.985.7 ± 4.319.6 ± 9.6Kir3.1-(180–501)71.6 ± 6.314.3 ± 7.655.4 ± 4.13.7 ± 0.6Kir3.1-(180–307)95.7 ± 5.368.7 ± 6.198.1 ± 8.511.0 ± 2.2Kir3.1-(308–501)96.5 ± 7.190.1 ± 2.297.3 ± 6.318.0 ± 1.1Kir3.2-(192–425)99.4 ± 4.354.5 ± 1.589.0 ± 0.5711.5 ± 2.5Truncated Kir3.1 polypeptide were cotranslated and coimmunoprecipitated with either Kir3.1 or Kir3.2 in the presence of microsomal membranes.

Open table in a new tab Truncated Kir3.1 polypeptide were cotranslated and coimmunoprecipitated with either Kir3.1 or Kir3.2 in the presence of microsomal membranes.

Each experiment was performed from 3 to 8 times, and the values given are means ± S.E. To test whether the C-terminal domain of the Kir3.1 subunit interacts with either N- or C-terminal regions of neighboring subunits, two constructs with minimal sequence overlap, Kir3.1-(1–200) and Kir3.1-(180–501), were cotranslated and immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed to the N-terminal region of Kir3.1. The C-terminal polypeptide failed to coprecipitate with Kir3.1-(1–200) (Fig.4). Similarly, polypeptide Kir3.2-(192–425), which contains the entire C-terminal region of Kir3.2, did not coprecipitate with Kir3.1-(1–200), although it did coprecipitate with both full-length Kir3.1 and the Kir3.1 C-terminal polypeptide (Fig. 4). None of the C-terminal segments (Kir3.1-(180–501), -(180–307), and -(308–501) and Kir3.2-(192–425)) coprecipitated with the N-terminal polypeptide Kir3.1-(1–85) (results not shown). This suggests that in heteromeric and homomeric complexes, the C-terminal regions of neighboring subunits interact. To locate the interaction sites for the proximal and distal C-terminal segments on the Kir3.1 polypeptide we tested the ability of both segments to coprecipitate with construct 1–347, which has 154 residues of the distal C-terminal region deleted. Both segments coprecipitated with Kir3.1-(1–347), although the amount of Kir3.1-(308–501) coprecipitated with Kir3.1-(1–347) was less than the amount coprecipitated with full-length Kir3.1 subunits (Fig. 2). This indicates that binding of this segment to Kir3.1 involves an interaction with both proximal and distal C-terminal regions of the subunit. To test the ability of the truncated polypeptides to compete with the full-length subunits during the assembly of Kir3 channels in a cell, they were coexpressed with Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 in Xenopusoocytes. The coexpression of Kir3.1-(1–347) with Kir3.2 and the M2-muscarinic receptor produced no basal or agonist-stimulated Kir currents (results not shown), indicating that the truncated polypeptide was unable to substitute for Kir3.1 in the formation of functional heteromeric channels. Five days after injecting the cRNAs, the antibody raised against Kir3.2 was unable to detect any channel expression at the oocyte plasma membrane. In contrast, oocytes from the same batch that were injected with Kir3.2 plus M2-muscarinic receptor cRNAs alone showed intense immunofluorescence staining of Kir3.2 at the cell surface (Fig.5 B). This suggests that Kir3.1-(1–347) coassembled with Kir3.2, thereby inhibiting the formation of Kir3.2 homomeric channels. The complexes formed were not delivered to the cell surface, indicating that the distal C-terminal segment of the Kir3.1 polypeptide plays a critical role in this process. The truncated constructs were tested for their ability to reduce the size of the Kir3.1/Kir3.2 heteromeric channel currents rather than the Kir3.2 homomeric currents because the heteromeric currents were much larger. The Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 cRNAs were injected either undiluted or diluted 3-, 10-, or 100-fold, with or without the undiluted construct cRNAs. Currents recorded at −80 mV from oocytes expressing the truncated polypeptides were normalized to currents recorded from oocytes expressing Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 alone (Fig. 5 A). The amount of inhibition was concentration-dependent, increasing as the ratio of construct cRNA to Kir3.1/Kir3.2 cRNAs increased. The greatest inhibition was seen with Kir3.1-(1–347), followed by Kir3.1-(1–200) and then the chimeric core region construct, Kir3.1-(∼80–190). It appears that the core region alone can bind to the full-length subunits and that adding the N-terminal and proximal C-terminal regions increases the overall binding affinity. This supports the contribution of regions 1–79, 80–190, and 200–347 to intersubunit binding interactions. Kir3.1-(1–347) was less effective at inhibiting Kir3.1/Kir3.2 heteromultimerization than Kir3.2 homomultimerization. Coinjected with undiluted Kir3.1/Kir3.2 cRNAs, it reduced the current amplitude by 44%. This suggests that Kir3.2 subunits prefer to bind Kir3.1 subunits rather than themselves. Construct Kir3.1-(1–160) competed much less effectively than Kir3.1-(1–200), suggesting that TMD2 makes an important contribution to the coassembly of subunits. Immunofluorescence labeling of Kir3.2 in oocytes expressing Kir3.1-(1–200) with the 10-fold diluted cRNAs showed that the truncated polypeptide reduced cell surface expression of this subunit (Fig. 5 B). The soluble N- and C-terminal polypeptides all reduced the size of the currents when the Kir3.1/Kir3.2 cRNAs were diluted 100-fold. Kir3.1-(180–307) and Kir3.1-(308–501) were as effective as the entire C-terminal domain, which supports the in vitrotranslation/coimmunoprecipitation data. Kir3.1 subunits coassemble with other members of the Kir3 subfamily to form G-protein-activated, inwardly rectifying K+ channels. By analyzing the binding interactions between truncated Kir3.1 polypeptides and full-length Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 subunits in an in vitro expression system and inXenopus oocytes, we have identified several regions distributed throughout the Kir3.1 polypeptide that appear to contribute to intersubunit binding interactions. These regions lie within the N-terminal, core, and C-terminal domains, suggesting that they are all involved in the coassembly of subunits. Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 C-terminal polypeptides recognized each other but did not appear to recognize either the N-terminal or core regions of Kir3.1. This suggests that within the Kir3 channel complex, the C-terminal regions of neighboring subunits interact as do the more N-terminal regions. Coprecipitation experiments showed that all of the truncated Kir3.1 polypeptides bound to both Kir3.1 and Kir3.2, suggesting that Kir3.1 subunits are capable of forming homomeric as well as heteromeric complexes. These homomeric complexes are not processed to the plasma membrane in Xenopus oocytes,2 which suggests that they may have a different quaternary structure from that of the heteromeric complexes that are appropriately delivered to the cell surface. The quantitative analysis of the amount of coprecipitated products showed that there was a difference in the amount of Kir3.1 C-terminal polypeptides coprecipitated with Kir3.2 compared with Kir3.1, suggesting that this region plays a discriminatory role in the coassembly of Kir3 subunits. Our studies with Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 chimeric subunits suggest that both the cytoplasmic tails and the core region of the Kir3.1 subunit inhibit the expression of homomeric channels at the cell surface.2 The ability of Kir3.1-(∼80–190) to coprecipitate with Kir3.2in vitro and to reduce functional expression of the Kir3.1/Kir3.2 channels in oocytes suggests that the Kir3.1 TMDs can recognize and bind to Kir3.2 in the absence of the cytoplasmic tails. This is assuming that the short, hydrophilic Kir2.1 region is not responsible for the binding interaction and that the difference seen between Kir3.1-(77–190) and the chimeric core construct is caused by the inability of Kir3.1-(77–190) to incorporate into the microsomal membranes. The relative contributions of TMD1 and the N-terminal region to the binding interaction is unclear. In thein vitro expression system, Kir3.1-(1–160) was coprecipitated in the presence of microsomes, whereas Kir3.1-(1–85) was not. This suggests that the TMD1 and H5 region plays an important role in the coassembly of subunits. Kir3.1-(1–160) was glycosylated, indicating its incorporation into microsomes. The contribution of the TMD1 and H5 region may have been simply to incorporate the polypeptide into the microsomal membranes, thereby increasing its rate of encounter with the full-length subunits and promoting the binding of the N-terminal domain, or it may have included a direct involvement of this region in intersubunit binding interactions. In oocytes, Kir3.1-(1–160) was similar to Kir3.1-(1–85) in only producing a significant reduction in channel expression when coinjected with the 100-fold diluted Kir3.1/Kir3.2 cRNAs. It is possible that the 1–85 peptide had a greater opportunity to bind to the full-length subunits when expressed in oocytes rather than in vitro due to the spatial localization of the translational machinery and the endoplasmic reticulum, and thus the role of TMD1 in increasing the rate of association was reduced. Alternatively, the reduction in current amplitude produced by Kir3.1-(1–85) may have been partly a functional inhibition caused by binding to G-protein βγ-subunits. A similar mechanism was proposed by Dascal et al. (42Dascal N. Doupnik C.A. Ivanina T. Bausch S. Wang W. Lin C. Garvey J. Chavkin C. Lester H.A. Davidson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) to account for the inhibition of Kir3.1 functional expression by the myristoylated C-terminal tail of Kir3.1. Kir3.1-(1–200) was much more effective than Kir3.1-(1–160) in inhibiting channel expression in oocytes, suggesting that TMD2 directly participates in intersubunit binding interactions. In voltage-gated K+ channels, the NAB region within the N-terminal domain appears to have two functions in regulating α-subunit coassembly. Within subfamilies it provides a recognition site for coassembly and stabilizes the tetrameric complex, whereas between subfamilies it prevents coassembly taking place. Lee et al. (43Lee T.E. Philipson L.H. Kuznetsov A. Nelson D.J. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 667-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed that deleting this N-terminal region enabled two subunits from different subfamilies to form functional heteromeric complexes. Our results suggest that within the Kir3 subfamily the N-terminal domain does not have a dominant role. Regions within the core and the C-terminal domain are involved in subunit recognition, and whether or not they have an additional role in creating subunit incompatibility remains to be determined. While this paper was undergoing editorial review, Tinker et al. (Tinker, A., Jan, Y. N., and Jan, L. Y. (1996) Cell 87, 857–868) reported that the proximal C-terminus and TMD2 determines assembly of Kir2 channels. We thank Drs. L. Y. Jan and J. P. Adelman for Kir3.1 and Kir3.2 cDNAs, respectively.

Loss of skeletal muscle is an acute metabolic response to infection and neoplastic disease and results from a decrease in the rate of protein synthesis and an increase in the rate of protein degradation (e.g. see Refs. 1Hasselgren P.O.

J. 1987; 247: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) laboratories have shown that these two agents both stimulate protein synthesis and reduce the release ofN τ-methylhistidine, a marker of myofibrillar protein degradation from intact skeletal muscle in vitro and skeletal muscle cells in culture. However, the mechanism(s) mediating these effects are poorly understood.Many extracellular signals such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and growth factors elicit their response by activating an intracellular signaling cascade that is initiated by the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids (8Axelrod J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1990; 18: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 9Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6148) Google Scholar, 10Billah M.M. Curr. Opin.

In L6 skeletal muscle cells, we have demonstrated that TPA and vasopressin stimulate both protein synthesis and a phospholipase D (PLD) that degrades phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, incubation of L6 cells with exogenous PLD mimicked the effects of TPA and vasopressin on protein synthesis, implying a link between the two events (4Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Morrison K.S. Thom A. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, TPA increased protein synthesis only during short term (90-min) incubations, which were neither blocked by the transcription inhibitor, actinomycin D, nor accompanied by increases in RNA, implying an effect only on translation. In contrast, the synthesis response to vasopressin was detected solely over longer term (6-h) incubations, where increases in RNA content and sensitivity to actinomycin D were observed, demonstrating effects on transcription (4Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Morrison K.S. Thom A. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).One explanation of why TPA and vasopressin produced such temporally different effects on protein synthesis involves the hydrolysis by PLD of phospholipids other than phosphatidylcholine with the production of different phosphatidic acid (PA) species that either directly or indirectly manipulate translation and transcription. Although most studies of PLD to date have focused on phosphatidylcholine, it is now clear that phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is also a substrate for PLD. TPA has been shown to activate a PLD that degrades PE in several cell types (e.g. 12–15), while as far as we are aware, there is no published evidence demonstrating that vasopressin elicits PE hydrolysis. Thus, to gain a greater insight into the mechanism(s) through which these two agonists may elicit temporally different increases in protein synthesis, we have initially focused in this study on PE metabolism and considered the possibility that TPA and vasopressin stimulate a PLD that degrades PE in L6 skeletal muscle myoblasts.Alternative explanations of the temporally different effects of TPA, vasopressin, and exogenous PLD include the possibility that either the PLD preparation may have elicited its responses through a different mechanism, e.g. through the production of lysophosphatidic acid (16Durieux M.E. Lynch K.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 249-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), or that the stimulation of PLD by TPA and/or vasopressin is not related to their effects on protein synthesis. In many cell types, studies using protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors and down-regulation protocols have implicated PKC in the stimulation of PLD by TPA and vasopressin (e.g. see Refs. 10Billah M.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 17Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the second aspect of this study, we have used similar approaches to investigate both the regulation of PE hydrolysis by PLD and the possibility that activation of PLD can be dissociated from the stimulation of protein synthesis.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrate in this study that TPA and vasopressin stimulate [14C]ethanolamine release from prelabeled L6 myoblasts. These effects were elicited in the presence of a large excess of unlabeled ethanolamine and phosphoethanolamine, thus precluding the possibility that [14C]ethanolamine was derived from [14C]phosphoethanolamine. Furthermore, the excess unlabeled ethanolamine also explains the steady increase in extracellular [14C]ethanolamine with time in unstimulated cells. The vast majority of any ethanolamine taken up by the cells is likely to be unlabeled, and thus [14C]ethanolamine released by continuous basal PLD activity (as demonstrated by basal [3H]PtdBuOH production at the end of a 2-h incubation) is likely to accumulate.When taken together with effects on [3H]PtdBuOH formation, the data imply that both TPA and vasopressin activate a PLD that degrades PE. Furthermore, the time- and concentration-dependent release of extracellular [14C]ethanolamine in response to both agonists mirrored their effects on extracellular [3H]choline release in these cells (4Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Morrison K.S. Thom A. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Comparison of the time-dependent effects on [3H]PtdBuOH formation by TPA using the two different protocols suggests that some of the data in the literature and the conclusions drawn from it should be treated with caution. When sufficient butanol is present for transphosphatidylation to take place, the TPA response clearly correlates with the effect on extracellular [14C]ethanolamine release; i.e. both events are sustained for at least 2 h. Interestingly, using the modified protocol to assess [3H]PtdBuOH formation, we have found in C2C12 myoblasts that the activation of PLD by TPA continues for at least 6 h. 2K. S. Morrison and M. G. Thompson, unpublished observation. TPA also stimulates ethanolamine release within 2 min in HeLa cells (12Hii C.S.T. Edwards Y.S. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20238-20243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and after a lag period (10 min) in HL-60 cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, and baby hamster kidney cells (13Kiss Z. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1483-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, as far as we are aware, this is the first demonstration that vasopressin stimulates a PLD that degrades PE in any cell type or tissue. Many of these previous studies have measured either total ethanolamine metabolites and failed to distinguish between intra- and extracellular release (e.g. see Refs. 13Kiss Z. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1483-1487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Kiss Z. Chattopadhyay J. Pettit G.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 28Kiss Z. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and 29Kiss Z. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or have measured only extracellular release (12Hii C.S.T. Edwards Y.S. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20238-20243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When intra- and extracellular release of choline has been measured, both vasopressin and TPA rapidly stimulated intracellular release. The vasopressin response had returned to control values within 10 min, and that for TPA was almost restored within 20 min (e.g. see Ref. 30Plevin R. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 759-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The different time course of intra- and extracellular release observed with TPA may reflect hydrolysis of PE pools in the inner and outer leaflet of the plasma membrane or in intracellular membranes. It might also involve the activity of both cytosolic and membrane-bound PLD activities (e.g. see Ref. 31Wang P. Anthes J.C. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14877-14880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and see below). In addition to TPA and vasopressin, PE hydrolysis by PLD has also been reported to be stimulated by adenine nucleotides (28Kiss Z. Anderson W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor and bombesin (29Kiss Z. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), lipid A (32Harris W.E. Bursten S.L. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 675-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and endothelin (33Kester M. Simonson M.S. McDermott R.G. Baldi E. Dunn M.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Vasopressin, which generates diacylglycerol and thus stimulates PKC through inositol lipid hydrolysis (4Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Morrison K.S. Thom A. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and TPA, activates PLD in many cell types, suggesting a role for PKC in the activation of PLD. In this and several other studies, inhibitors of PKC and down-regulation of PKC have been shown to attenuate TPA and vasopressin-stimulated PLD activity (e.g. see Refs. 34Cabot M.C. Welsh C.I. Zhang Z. Cao Y.Z. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1450-1456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Plevin R. Stewart A. Paul A. Wakelam M.J.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 104: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Our observation that down-regulation completely prevented TPA- and vasopressin-induced [3H]choline or [14C]ethanolamine release or [3H]PtdBuOH formation clearly implicates PKC in this event. This suggests that the inability of Ro-31-8220 completely to inhibit TPA-induced extracellular release and vasopressin-induced intracellular release of [14C]ethanolamine may be due to its action as a competitive inhibitor (18Davis P.D. Hill C.H. Keech E. Lawton G. Nixon J.S. Sedgwick A.D. Wadsworth J. Westmacott D. Wilkinson S.E. FEBS Lett. 1989; 259: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Contrastingly, in other cell types, the activation of PLD by TPA may not involve PKC. For example, PKC inhibitors failed to block the activation of PLD by TPA in lymphocytes (37Cao Y.Z. Reddy C. Mastro A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and mast cells (38Yamada K. Kanaho Y. Kiura K. Nozawa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).To gain further insight into the mechanism through which PKC regulates PLD in L6 cells, we examined which isoforms are present and subject to down-regulation. As far as we are aware, this is the first attempt to study PKC isoforms in L6 cells. A previous study in skeletal muscle and L8 skeletal muscle cells demonstrated the presence of PKC-α, -δ, and -ζ, but not PKC-β αnd -γ. Furthermore, α and δ, but not ζ were down-regulated by TPA in L8 cells (39Hong D. Huan J. Ou B. Yeh J. Saido T.C. Cheeke P.R. Forsberg N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1267: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These are very similar to our findings reported in this study and in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. 3M. G. Thompson and A. Thom, unpublished observation. Other work has also reported the presence of PKC-α (40Osada S.I. Mizuno K. Saido T.C. Suzuki K. Kuroki T. Ohno S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3930-3938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yamada K. Avignon A. Standaert M.L. Cooper D.R. Spencer B. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), -δ (41Yamada K. Avignon A. Standaert M.L. Cooper D.R. Spencer B. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 42Mizuno K. Kubo K. Saido T.C. Akita Y. Osada S. Kuroki T. Ohno S. Suzuki K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 931-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and -ε (41Yamada K. Avignon A. Standaert M.L. Cooper D.R. Spencer B. Farese R.V. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in skeletal muscle.The data showing a correlation between the disappearance of PKC-α, -δ, and -ε and the loss of PLD activation by TPA and vasopressin clearly implicate one or more of these isoforms in this response. Their down-regulation upon TPA treatment has been observed in other cell lines (e.g. see Refs. 39Hong D. Huan J. Ou B. Yeh J. Saido T.C. Cheeke P.R. Forsberg N.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1267: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 43Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and 44Akita Y. Ohno S. Yajima Y. Suzuki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PKC-α has been shown to activate PLD in Madin Darby canine kidney cells (45Balboa M.A. Firestein B.L. Godson C. Bell K.S. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CCL39 fibroblasts (46Conricode K.M. Smith J.L. Burns D.J. Exton J.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 342: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), while PKC-ε has been suggested to regulate PLD activity in rat mesangial cells (47Pfeilschifter J. Huwiler A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 331: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). There is no evidence to date of a role for PKC-δ in the regulation of PLD activity. It is not yet clear from our data if TPA and vasopressin activate the same PKC and/or PLD. Interestingly, although PKC-α is largely cytosolic in L6 and other cell lines (e.g. see Ref. 43Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have found PKC-ε to be membrane-associated, and this is also the case to some degree in U937 cells (48Ways D.K. Messner B.R. Garris T.O. Quin W. Cook P.P. Parker P.J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5604-5609PubMed Google Scholar), rat6 fibroblasts (49Borner C. Guadagno S.N. Fabbro D. Weinstein I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12892-12899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and renal mesangial cells (50Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). It is intriguing to suggest that isoform and/or location-specific PKC/PLD activities may be responsible for both the rapid but transient responses and the delayed but sustained stimulation observed with TPA. Such a possibility requires further investigation.We have previously shown in L6 myoblasts that the EC50 for vasopressin stimulation of transcription is 10-fold higher than that for [3H]PtdBuOH formation and [3H]choline release (4Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Morrison K.S. Thom A. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Data from the current study show that this is also true for [14C]ethanolamine release. Furthermore, the maximal stimulation of protein synthesis observed with exogenous PLD at 6 h was 12%, whereas an increase of 30% or more was elicited by vasopressin (4Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Morrison K.S. Thom A. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, while data in this and our previous study (4Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Morrison K.S. Thom A. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) support a link between the activation of PLD and the stimulation of translation by TPA, it also implies that, at best, activation of PLD is only part of the mechanism by which vasopressin increases protein synthesis in these cells. It is now clear that while PKC is involved in the stimulation of both PLD and transcription by vasopressin, the down-regulation protocol makes it possible to dissociate the two events completely. Thus, different isoforms of PKC mediate vasopressin effects on PLD and protein synthesis. Consequently, it appears that the increase in transcription we have previously observed with exogenous PLD in these cells (4Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Morrison K.S. Thom A. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) must involve an alternative mechanism to that employed by vasopressin (see below). This conclusion is also supported by the finding that the stimulation of protein synthesis at 6 h by exogenous PLD, but not vasopressin, is partially attenuated by PKC down-regulation. One possible mechanism involves the generation of lysophosphatidic acid and its action through an extracellular receptor (16Durieux M.E. Lynch K.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 249-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting of the down-regulated cells implicates PKC-μ, -ι, and/or -ζ in the stimulation of protein synthesis by vasopressin. However, all three isoforms have a high degree of sequence homology, raising the possibility of cross-reactivity between the antibodies. Studies have shown that the ι antibody cross-reacts with ζ, 4C. Davies, personal communication. and, since we have been unable to obtain an alternative source of ι antibody, its presence in L6 cells remains unproven at present. The antibody to PKC-μ clearly detects a protein of 115 kDa, but it fails to recognize any bands in the 70–90-kDa range. Furthermore, the antibodies to ι and ζ do not detect the 115-kDa protein. Thus, from the data available on the three atypical isoforms, it appears likely that only μ and ζ are present. The inability of TPA to down-regulate PKC μ is also of interest, since when human PKC-μ was propagated in the baculovirus expression system and purified to homogeneity, it displayed high affinity TPA binding (51Dieterich S. Herget T. Link G. Bottinger H. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, this finding differs markedly from an earlier study in which only a very weak increase in TPA binding was observed in cellular extracts from PKC-μ transfectants (52Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The difference between the two observations may be due to unknown factors present in the cellular extracts that prevent TPA binding.Although the increase in translation elicited by insulin in L6 cells was not prevented by Ro-31-8220 (53Thompson M.G. Pascal M. Mackie S.C. Thom A. Morrison K.S. Backwell F.R.C. Palmer R.M. Biosci. Rep. 1995; 15: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), this inhibitor (54Thompson M.G. Acamovic F. Mackie S.C. Morrison K.S. Palmer R.M. Biosci. Rep. 1993; 13: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but not PKC down-regulation,3 also attenuated the stimulation of transcription by insulin, suggesting that vasopressin and insulin utilize the same subset of PKC isoforms.In many of the cell lines investigated so far, PKC-ζ seems to be present as a cytosolic enzyme (e.g. see Ref. 55Crabos M. Imber R. Woodtli T. Fabbro D. Erne P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As predicted from its structure, most studies, including the work reported here, indicate that PKC-ζ is resistant to TPA-induced translocation or down-regulation (e.g. see Refs. 50Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Pfeilschifter J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 56Ways D.K. Cook P.P. Webster C. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4799-4805Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, both of the PKC inhibitors that partially blocked the effect of vasopressin on transcription have been shown to inhibit PKC-ζ (e.g. see Ref. 57Yeo E.-J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The observation that higher concentrations of both agents (1 μm) were required to partially inhibit PKC ζ than to completely inhibit the α, δ, and ε isoforms (57Yeo E.-J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and our finding that Ro-31-8220 and bIM still elicited a partial inhibition of the vasopressin response following down-regulation further support a role for the down-regulation-resistant isoforms such as ζ in mediating the vasopressin response. In addition, vasopressin has been shown to stimulate the translocation of PKC ζ from the cytosol to a membrane fraction in human platelets (58Crabos M. Fabbro D. Stabel S. Erne P. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 891-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and in smooth muscle, phenylephrine elicits PKC-ζ translocation to the nucleus (59Khalil R.A. Lajoie C. Resnick M.S. Morgan K.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C714-C719Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a role in events such as gene expression.PKC-ζ has been shown to be stimulated in vitro by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (60Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the phospholipid that is thought to be the physiologically important product of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (61Stephens L. Eguinoa A. Corey S. Jackson T. Hawkins P.T. EMBO. J. 1993; 12: 2265-2273Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin (62Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar), had no effect on the ability of vasopressin to stimulate transcription in L6 cells, suggesting that phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase is not involved in mediating this response.3 PKC-ζ is also activated by arachidonic acid (63Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and preliminary data show that vasopressin increases arachidonic acid release from L6 cells. 5M. G. Thompson and S. C. Mackie, unpublished observation. Furthermore, we have previously shown that vasopressin stimulates mitogen-activated protein kinase in these cells (64Thompson M.G. Mackie S.C. Thom A. Hazlerigg D.G. Morrison K.S. Palmer R.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and mitogen-activated protein kinase is known to phosphorylate and activate cytosolic PLA2 (65Lin L.L. Wartmann M. Lin A.Y. Knopf J.L. Seth A. Davis R.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 269-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1643) Google Scholar), releasing arachidonic acid. Thus, it is possible that vasopressin may, at least in part, stimulate protein synthesis in L6 cells through PKC-ζ via mitogen-activated protein kinase, cytosolic PLA2, and arachidonic acid. This potential sequence of events is under further investigation.Although PLD is clearly not involved in the stimulation of protein synthesis by vasopressin, both this agonist and TPA also reduce myofibrillar protein degradation in skeletal muscle (6Thompson M.G. Palmer R.M. Thom A. Garden K. Lobley G.E. Calder G. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1875-C1879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Goodman M.N. Biochem. J. 1987; 247: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether PLD plays a role in the regulation of this component of protein turnover. Loss of skeletal muscle is an acute metabolic response to infection and neoplastic disease and results from a decrease in the rate of protein synthesis and an increase in the rate of protein degradation (e.g. see Refs. 1Hasselgren P.O. Talamini M. James H. Fischer J.E. Arch. Surg. 1986; 121: 919-923Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 2Strelkov A.B.S. Fields A.L.A. Baracos V.E. Am. J.

To reverse this process, an understanding of the signaling pathways regulating protein turnover is essential.

To elucidate the mechanisms controlling Xist expression and X inactivation, we examined in vivo DNA-protein interactions in the Xist promoter region in a female mouse cell line (BMSL2), which has distinguishable Xist alleles.In vivo footprinting was accomplished by treatment of cells with dimethyl sulfate or ultraviolet light, followed by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction of purified DNA. The expressed allele on the inactive X chromosome and the silent allele on the active X chromosome were separated by the use of a restriction fragment length polymorphism prior to ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. The chromatin structure of the Xistpromoter was found to be consistent with the activity state of theXist gene. The silent allele (on the active X chromosome) showed no footprints, while the expressed allele (on the inactive X chromosome) showed footprints at a consensus sequence for a CCAAT box, two weak Sp1 sites, and a weak TATA box.

Early in embryogenesis, X chromosome inactivation (XCI) 1The abbreviations used are: XCI, X chromosome inactivation; Xist, X inactive specific transcript; Xi, inactive X chromosome; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; kb, kilobase pair(s); LMPCR, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: XCI, X chromosome inactivation; Xist, X inactive specific transcript; Xi, inactive X chromosome; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; kb, kilobase pair(s); LMPCR, ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction. causes the heterochromatinization and genetic silencing of one of the two X chromosomes in female mammalian cells (see Refs. 1Lyon M.F. Nature. 1961; 190: 372-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (2566) Google Scholar and 2Lyon M.F. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 123-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The details of the establishment and maintenance of XCI are not yet known, but recent work has indicated that an X-linked gene, Xist (X inactive specific transcript), plays a critical role at least in the establishment stage (reviewed in Refs. 3Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. DNA Methylation: Molecular Biology and Biological Significance.in: Jost J. Saluz H. Birkhauser Verlag, Berlin1993: 358-384Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar and 4Rastan S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Xist gene (XISTin humans) is expressed only from the inactive X chromosome (Xi) and thus only in female somatic cells. Xist codes for a large RNA that is preferentially localized in the nucleus and has no conserved open reading frame. The gene maps to the X inactivation center, which includes the X-controlling element, a cis-acting locus that controls the likelihood of inactivation of a given X chromosome. Recent evidence suggests that the X-controlling element locus (5Simmler M.C. Cattanach B.M. Rasberry C. Rougeulle C. Avner P. Mamm. Genome. 1993; 4: 30-523Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar), as well as other potential key elements of XCI (6Penny G.D. Kay G.F. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Brockdorff N. Nature. 1996; 379: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 7Courtier B. Heard E. Avner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), are separate fromXist. Although the X inactivation center region includingXist is apparently not necessary for the maintenance of XCI, at least in cultured cells (8Brown C.J. Willard H.F. Nature. 1994; 368: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), other recent evidence suggests a possible role at several stages of XCI. The level of XistRNA increases early in embryogenesis just prior to the time of XCI, which is indicative of a role in establishment (9Kay G.F. Penny G.D. Patel D. Ashworth A. Brockdorff N. Rastan S. Cell. 1993; 72: 171-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion of one Xist allele by gene targeting in female embryonic stem cells has provided strong evidence that Xistis necessary in cis for XCI to occur both in vitro andin vivo (6Penny G.D. Kay G.F. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Brockdorff N.

Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Furthermore, cytological studies showing localization of Xist RNA to Xi (10Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 11Panning B. Jaenisch R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1991-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) suggest some role in maintaining the structure of the inactive X, despite the relatively low levels of Xist transcripts (12Buzin C.H. Mann J.R. Singer-Sam J. Development. 1994; 120: 3529-3536PubMed Google Scholar). Lee et al. (13Lee J.T. Strauss W.M. Dausman J.A. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1996; 86: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) have recently found that in ES cells sequences contained within a 450-kb YAC including the Xistgene are sufficient to induce inactivation when integrated into autosomes in multiple copies. In addition to the Xist locus, the YAC includes a GC-rich island 15 kb 3′ to the Xist gene that is hypermethylated on the active X chromosome, to an extent that varies with different X-controlling element loci (7Courtier B. Heard E. Avner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions at the Xist promoter are likely to be important for understanding the establishment of XCI. In addition to studies indicating differential DNA methylation in the Xist 5′ region (14Norris D.P. Patel D. Kay G.F. Penny G.D. Brockdorff N. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Cell. 1994; 77: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), there has so far been one published report on DNA-protein interactions at the promoter (15Pillet N. Bonny C. Schorderet D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In that report, in vitrogel mobility shift assays and reporter gene assays were used to characterize several functional elements, including a potential TATA-binding protein element −25 to −30 base pairs from the transcription start site and a second element just upstream of this site. Here we report results of an in vivo footprinting study of the Xist promoter region, in which we separately analyzed the expressed and silent Xist alleles after in vivo treatment of the mouse female cell line, BMSL2 (16Park J.G. Chapman V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7975-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intact cells were treated with dimethyl sulfate (DMS) or UV, and then the DNA was analyzed by use of ligation-mediated PCR (LMPCR). We find evidence for several specific protein-DNA interactions on the expressedXist allele, but none on the silent allele. BMSL2 cells (HOBMSL2 cells) (16Park J.G. Chapman V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7975-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are derived from F1 female liver cells of the cross C57BL/6-Hprt a Pgk-1 a(strain AT29) × congenic strainHprt b-m3 Pgk-1 b (strain BM3). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, supplemented with 1 × nonessential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum. They were grown as monolayers to about 70% confluency and then were used for DMS treatment or UV irradiation. After treatment of the cells with 0.1% DMS (Aldrich) in serum-free medium at room temperature for 5 min, they were washed twice with serum-free medium, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then were lysed. UV irradiation was performed using a Stratalinker 2400 UV cross-linker (Stratagene). The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, irradiated with 1000 J/m2 UV (254 nm), and lysed immediately. The cells were lysed by the direct addition of 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% SDS, and 0.3–0.5 mg/ml proteinase K. The lysates were incubated at 37 °C overnight. In the case of DMS treatment, the incubation time was shortened to 3 h to minimize cutting of the DNA at modified residues at this incubation temperature. After the addition of NaCl to a final concentration of 290 mm, the lysates were extracted once with phenol and once with chloroform. Nucleic acids were precipitated with an equal volume of 2-propanol, resuspended in 10 mmTris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 5 μg/ml DNase-free RNase (Boehringer Mannheim), and incubated at room temperature overnight. After phenol extraction and chloroform extraction, DNA was precipitated with 2-propanol. As a control, DNA extracted from untreated cells was treated in vitro with DMS or UV. In vitro DMS treatment was performed essentially as described by Maxam and Gilbert (17Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (8987) Google Scholar). DNA (100 μg) was treated with 0.2 μl of DMS in a volume of 202 μl at room temperature for 2 min. In vitro UV treatment was performed by exposing 50-μl droplets containing 0.1 mg/ml DNA, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), and 1 mm EDTA to 1000 J/m2 UV. DNA of each sample (40 μg) was digested with restriction endonucleasesHpaI, PvuII, and XbaI (200 units each) at 37 °C for 5 h. The resulting restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis through a 0.8% agarose gel in 50 mm TBE buffer containing 2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. To minimize photodamage, DNA was visualized by brief use of a long wavelength ultraviolet transilluminator. Slits were cut in the gel above and below the regions of interest, and the desired DNA fragments (1.0–1.8 kb for Xi; 2.3–4.4 kb for active X chromosomes) were collected by electrophoresis onto NA45 DEAE-cellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The fragments were eluted by incubating the membrane three times for 30 min in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 2 m NaCl at 37 °C. After phenol-chloroform extraction and 2-propanol precipitation, samples (3 μg) were treated with piperidine to induce cleavage at the sites of methylguanines or (6-4) photoproducts, or were incubated first with T4 endonuclease V and then with photolyase to induce cleavage at the sites of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, both as described by Tornaletti and Pfeifer (19Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). LMPCR was done essentially as described (19Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Pfiefer G.P. Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 567-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 16: 153-168Google Scholar), except that Vent (exo−) DNA polymerase (exo−; New England Biolabs Inc.) was used in the first strand synthesis as well as in the PCR step of LMPCR, and a post-PCR booster step was done using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Six primers were used: A1, GATATATTGAAATTTTGCATAGACA; A2, TTTTGCATAGACAGGTGTGTGACCTAATGT; A3, CATTATTTAATGTTTATGTGGAAGTTCTACA; B1, CCATAAGGCTTGGTGGTAGG; B2, CTTGGTGGTAGGGGAACTAAAAATGTTC; B3, AAAAATGTTCCCCCAAAGCTCCTTAG. The A primers (upstream primers) were used to analyze the lower strand of theXist promoter. The B primers (downstream primers) were for the analysis of the upper strand. Cleaved DNA (0.3 μg) in 28 μl of first strand mix was denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and annealed for 20 min at 47 °C (with primer A1) or at 51 °C (with B1). After the addition of 1.2 units of exo− (diluted to 2 μl) on ice, each sample was incubated at the annealing temperature for 3 min and then at 72 °C for 2 min. This reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 20 nm primer A1 or B1, 250 μm each dNTP, 5 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgSO4 in addition to 1 × ThermoPol Buffer (New England Biolabs Inc.). After the addition of 40 μl of ligation solution (48 mmTris (pH 7.5), 19 mm MgCl2, 19 mmdithiothreitol, 1.9 mm ATP, 48 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 4.5 units (Weiss) of T4 DNA ligase) and 5 μl of 20 μm double-stranded linker in 250 mm Tris (pH 7.7) on ice, the mixture was incubated at 17 °C overnight. DNA was precipitated by addition of 20 μl of 10 m ammonium acetate, 2 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, 1.5 μl of 20 mg/ml glycogen, and 250 μl of ethanol. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 μl of water. After the addition of 50 μl of amplification mixture consisting of 2 × ThermoPol Buffer, 8 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm each dNTP, 0.4 μmprimer A2 or B2, 0.4 μm linker primer, and 4 units of exo−, the sample was subjected to PCR using 23 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C (4 min at 95 °C for the first cycle), 2 min at 61 °C (with primer A1) or 59 °C (with B2), and 1 min at 72 °C. After thermal cycling, AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (1 unit) was added, and the sample was further incubated at 72 °C for 8 min prior to phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. Following published procedures (20Pfiefer G.P. Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 567-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 16: 153-168Google Scholar), the PCR-amplified fragments were resolved by electrophoresis through a denaturing polyacrylamide gel (8%), transferred to a nylon membrane by electroblotting, and visualized by autoradiography after hybridization with a single-stranded probe. The probe was made as described (22Tommasi S. LeBon J.M. Riggs A.D. Singer-Sam J. Somat. Cell Mol. Genet. 1993; 19: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) from the plasmid pGPT2 (14Norris D.P. Patel D. Kay G.F. Penny G.D. Brockdorff N. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Cell. 1994; 77: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), consisting of the vector pBluescript II KS(+) (Stratagene) and a 4.4-kb EcoRI insert that includes the 5′ region of the Xist gene (see Fig. 1). AfterHaeIII digestion, pGPT2 (50 ng) was mixed with 5 units ofTaq polymerase, GeneAmp 1 × PCR buffer (Perkin-Elmer), 0.5 μm primer A3 or B3, 0.67 μm[α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol), and 20 μmeach of dATP, dGTP, and dTTP in a volume of 50 μl. Repeated run-off synthesis was performed with 30 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C (3 min at 94 °C for the first cycle) and 2 min at 52 °C (with primer A3) or at 58 °C (with B3) and 2 min at 72 °C. The theoretical length of the resulting single-stranded probes was 202 and 150 bases for synthesis directed by primers A3 and B3, respectively. After visual inspection of the autoradiogram, band ratios were measured by use of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). Only regions showing at least 50% differences between the in vivo sample and the purified DNA control were considered to be footprints. The mouse cell line BMSL2 is an established line derived from the liver of female F1 hybrids with an active X chromosome containing the Hprt b-m3 mutation (derived from strain BM3) and an Xi carrying the Pgk-1 a andHprt a alleles (derived from strain AT29). The cells contain normal steady-state levels of XistRNA. 2C. Buzin and J. Singer-Sam, unpublished observations. Sequence analysis after reverse transcriptase PCR has shown that Xist RNA is transcribed only from the AT29 X chromosome (16Park J.G. Chapman V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7975-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Pgk-1 RNA is transcribed only from the BM3 X chromosome. 3J. M. LeBon and J. Singer-Sam, unpublished observations. Because only the AT29 allele has an extra PvuII site near the transcription start site (6Penny G.D. Kay G.F. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Brockdorff N. Nature. 1996; 379: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1), the promoter region of the BM3 allele of the Xist gene can be distinguished from that of the AT29 allele by Southern blotting (Fig. 2). When DNA from BMSL2 cells was digested with PvuII in addition toHpaI and XbaI (Fig. 2, lane 2), a 1.5-kb fragment (the AT29 allele) and a 3.5-kb fragment (the BM3 allele) were detected. Fig. 2 also shows that the BM3 Xistallele is methylated at all HhaI sites in the 5′ region (Fig. 1), unlike the AT29 allele. When the methylation-sensitive enzymeHhaI was added (Fig. 2, lane 3), the AT29 allele was further digested, whereas the BM3 allele remained intact. Since previous studies (14Norris D.P. Patel D. Kay G.F. Penny G.D. Brockdorff N. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Cell. 1994; 77: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) have established that the silent allele is methylated in somatic cells whereas the expressed allele is unmethylated, these results further confirm that the BM3 allele is silent, whereas the AT29 allele is expressed. Treatment of BMSL2 cells with DMS (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 5) or with UV (lanes 6 and 7) before DNA extraction did not interfere with agarose gel separation, as expected because breakage of the DNA phosphodiester bonds does not take place until subsequent chemical or enzymatic cleavage (19Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis and recovery of separated fragments, the DNA was treated with piperidine or with T4 endonuclease V and photolyase. Piperidine cleaves DMS-treated DNA predominantly at sites of methylated guanines and UV-irradiated DNA predominantly at sites of (6-4) photoproducts. T4 endonuclease V cleaves UV-irradiated DNA at the sites of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, and photolyase renders fragment ends ligatable. The positions of cleavage were determined at single-nucleotide resolution by LMPCR. To increase sensitivity, we used Vent (exo−) DNA polymerase both in the first strand synthesis and in the PCR step, instead of Sequenase and Taq DNA polymerase (20Pfiefer G.P. Singer-Sam J. Riggs A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 567-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 21Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 16: 153-168Google Scholar) or Vent DNA polymerase (24Garrity P.A. Wold B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1021-1025Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 25Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 30-1419Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). When the amount of input DNA was small, the exo− enzyme gave more intense signals (see Fig. 3), perhaps because of the lack of both 3′→5′ and 5′→3′ exonuclease activities. This enzyme, however, generates two kinds of DNA fragment ends, blunt ends and single-base 3′ overhangs, sometimes producing strong doublet bands in the sequencing ladder (Fig. 3, lanes 5 and 6). To solve this problem, we added after the last cycle of PCR a final treatment withTaq polymerase. This booster step efficiently converts ends into single-base overhangs (Fig. 3, lanes 7 and8). In vivo footprints in the 5′ region of the Xistgene were discerned by comparing the pattern of the sequencing ladder of the in vivo treated DNA sample with that of in vitro treated purified DNA. Fig. 4 shows the result of in vivo DMS and UV footprinting of the lower strand of the Xist 5′ region from nucleotide −180 to +9 relative to the major transcription start site. Regions reproducibly showing 50% or more reduction (or enhancement) in band strength relative to that of the control are considered to be footprints and are marked byvertical bars. All of the footprints detected in this study were on the expressed allele; no footprints were observed on the silent allele. We found weak protection from DMS in the regions from −49 to −50 and from −65 to −73 (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and8). These two regions bind the transcription factor Sp1 with low affinity in vitro. 4S. A. Sheardown and N. Brockdorff, unpublished observations. There was a dipyrimidine showing strong hyper-reactivity for the in vivo formation of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers at nucleotides −102 and −103 only on the expressed allele. This TT dipyrimidine is in the sequence ATTGG, hence in a consensus CCAAT box. The enhancement of the formation of photoproducts in vivo in the CCAAT box has been reported for the human PGK1, c-JUN, andPCNA genes (19Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 23Pfeifer G.P. Drouin R. Riggs A.D. Holmquist G.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1798-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). We also find a hyper-reactive site for the in vivo formation of (6-4) photoproducts in the sequence TTT at nucleotides −26 to −28, despite the fact that TT dinucleotides are not preferred substrates for the formation of this photoproduct (26Brash D.E. Seetharam S. Kraemer K.H. Seidman M.M. Bredberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3782-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that this region (TTAAAG, −30 to −25) can be recognized by TATA-binding protein but may bind another protein with higher affinity (15Pillet N. Bonny C. Schorderet D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Assuming an interaction with TATA-binding protein, the unusual formation of (6-4) photoproducts at this dinucleotide might be due to the severe bending of DNA caused by the interaction of TATA-binding protein with the TATA box (27Kim J.L. Nikolov D.B. Burley S.K. Nature. 1993; 365: 520-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 28Kim Y. Geiger J.H. Hahn S. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1993; 365: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the analysis of the upper strand. No DMS footprints are apparent on this strand, but three regions show UV photofootprints. The strongest footprint is seen at the CC dipyrimidine at position −105 to −104, where an enhancement of (6-4) photoproducts is found (Fig. 5, lanes 15 and 16). These nucleotides are in a consensus CCAAT box and just opposite the hot spot for cyclobutane dimer formation (see Figs. 4 and 6). Protection from the formation of both (6-4) photoproducts and cyclobutane dimers is seen at nucleotides −69 to −68. Hyper-reactivity for cyclobutane dimer formation is also seen at nucleotides −66 to −65. These two dipyrimidine sites are opposite one of the DMS footprint regions on the lower strand. We also detected a weak hyper-reactive site for cyclobutane dimer formation (TTC at nucleotides −48 to −46) opposite to the other DMS footprint region on the lower strand.Figure 6Summary of DMS and UV footprinting experiments on both strands of the 5′ region of the expressed allele of the Xist gene.

Four regions with in vivo footprints were found, and all of them were on only the expressed allele. Three of the footprints can be detected on both upper and lower strands. The function(s) of the Xist gene is not yet clearly understood, but several studies suggest that it is a key element necessary for the establishment of X inactivation (6Penny G.D. Kay G.F. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Brockdorff N. Nature. 1996; 379: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar, 13Lee J.T. Strauss W.M. Dausman J.A. Jaenisch R.

Wiley J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12025-12029Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Establishment is likely to have several stages, four of which are (i) counting of the X to autosome ratio; (ii) initiation of the inactivation process if X/autosome = 1 or more; (iii) choosing which X remains active; and (iv) the spreading of inactivation to cover most genes on the X. Xist may not be necessary for the maintenance of X inactivation, at least in cultured cells (8Brown C.J. Willard H.F. Nature. 1994; 368: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), but on the other hand, Xist RNA is found in female tissues at all ages and has been postulated to be involved in chromosome architecture (10Clemson C.M. McNeil J.A. Willard H.F. Lawrence J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 259-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Correct Xist function during the establishment of X inactivation requires at least one other element to be located in cis within 1–2 megabases of the Xist locus (30Brown C.J. Lafreniere R.G. Powers V.E. Sebastio G. Ballabio A. Pettigrew A.L. Ledbetter D.H. Levy E. Craig I.W. Willard H.F. Nature. 1991; 349: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). An interesting region showing differential methylation correlated with different X-controlling element alleles has, in fact, been identified by Courtieret al. (7Courtier B. Heard E. Avner P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3531-3535Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) 15 kb downstream of Xist. Recently, Lee et al. (13Lee J.T. Strauss W.M. Dausman J.A. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1996; 86: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) obtained evidence for a “counting/choosing” element located within 450 kb ofXist and have speculated that this cis-acting regulatory element could sense an X chromosome number and then function as an enhancer of Xist expression. Considering a somewhat different question, Rastan (4Rastan S. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1994; 4: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) has speculated that the Xistgene is part of the mechanism that, after initiation of the X inactivation process, leads to the retention of one and only one active X chromosome per diploid autosomal set. The activation triggered by counting the X/autosome ratio is postulated to lead to the expression or activation of a blocking factor that binds to one copy of theXist gene. In a subsequent step, all copies of the X chromosome that are not “blocked” become inactivated. In its simplest form, this model suggests that the silent Xist gene (which is on the active X chromosome) could be kept silent by the binding of a special “blocking” factor. Both of these models suggest the need for characterization of protein-nucleic acid interactions at the Xist promoter. Also, since theXist gene is expressed from the Xi, it is to be expected that a transcription complex will be present on the Xistpromoter located on the Xi. But will this complex be present only in heterochromatin, as is found for some genes in Drosophila(31Devlin R.H. Bingham G. Wakimoto B.T. Genetics. 1990; 125: 129-140PubMed Google Scholar, 32Eberl D.F. Duyf B.J. Hilliker A.J. Genetics. 1993; 134: 277-292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)? For these reasons, in vitro and in vivostudies of the Xist promoter region may give substantial mechanistic insight. The mouse Xist promoter region has been characterized in a previous study (15Pillet N. Bonny C. Schorderet D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Reporter gene constructs containing various deletions or mutations in the promoter region were used to assay transcription after transfection. The results indicated that the major promoter activity is contained in a region from −82 to +20 relative to the transcription start site. Gel shift assays also were done, and sites for protein binding were identified. In no case were differences seen between male and female cells. However, in vitro DNA binding studies do not necessarily give an accurate picture of in vivo protein-DNA interactions, since the in vivochromatin structure can not yet be mimicked in vitro. We therefore sought to do an in vivo analysis of theXist promoter region, but this is not straightforward because Xist is only expressed in female somatic cells, and these have an equal mixture of expressed and silent alleles. To study the nucleoprotein structure of the expressed allele and to compare it with the silent allele, it was necessary to separately assay the two alleles. To accomplish this we used a hybrid mouse cell line (BMSL2) that has Xist alleles which are electrophoretically separable because of a restriction fragment length polymorphism. Isolation of DNA fragments after in vivo treatment, but prior to LMPCR, permitted separate analysis of silent and expressed alleles from the same nucleoplasm. Thus a picture of the minimally perturbed true in vivo chromatin configuration should be obtained by these studies. DMS is the most commonly used agent for both in vitro andin vivo footprinting. This alkylating agent is convenient to use, but detects DNA-protein interactions mainly at guanine residues, and DMS reactivity is not at all affected by some protein contacts, for example those found in nucleosomes (33McGhee J.D. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 2133-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Wang Z. Becker M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 654-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). So far UV photofootprinting (19Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 714-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) has been less commonly used for in vivo footprinting. UV makes two major photoproducts at sites of neighboring pyrimidines, cyclobutane dimers and (6-4) photoproducts. Photoreactivity is affected by alterations in DNA conformation induced by the presence of bound protein. Photodimer sites then can be converted to strand breaks and assayed by LMPCR (35Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 36Pfeifer G.P. Steigerwald S.D. Mueller P.R. Wold B. Riggs A.D.

Using the complementary methods of DMS footprinting and UV footprinting, we examined both strands of the promoter region of the mouse Xist gene (Fig. 6). This region is not very rich in guanines but does have numerous dipyrimidines (Fig. 6). We detected four regions with in vivo DMS or UV footprints in the 5′ region of the expressed allele (Figs. 4, 5, 6): a canonical CCAAT box (nucleotides −105 to −102), two weak Sp1 sites (−73 to −65 and −50 to −46), and a weak TATA box (−28 to −26). The in vivofootprints we observed are not dramatic (<8-fold difference in signal intensity versus the in vitro control), which is as one might expect for a gene expressed at relatively low level. Thein vivo footprints we detected are in sequences rather well conserved between mouse and human and correspond to the location ofin vitro footprints4. We did not see anyin vivo footprints at the major transcription start site, which contains a consensus sequence for an initiator element (37Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), although an in vitro footprint has been observed4. However, it should be noted that no in vivo footprints have been found at the transcription start site of human PGK1, a highly expressed X-linked gene that also has a consensus initiator near the start site (38Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). There was a clear photofootprint in the weak TATA box about 30 nucleotides upstream of the major start site, but we found no footprint in the TATA consensus sequence (nucleotides −129 to −123), which is located ∼40 nucleotides upstream of a minor start site (nucleotide −82). Thus, theXist promoter seems to work in vivo as a promoter with a weak TATA box as has been suggested (15Pillet N. Bonny C. Schorderet D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12515-12519Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and perhaps as a weak initiator element. Although both the expressed allele and the silent allele ofXist are in the same nucleus, and potentially exposed to the same transcription factors, there is no evidence for the presence of any transcription factors or special blocking factors on the silent allele. This result is consistent with in vivo footprinting results for other X-linked genes in that the silent allele has no transcription factors in the promoter region (38Pfeifer G.P. Riggs A.D. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 39Hornstra I.K. Yang T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5345-5354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For normal X-linked genes, it is assumed that methylation and/or a somatically heritable chromatin structure prevents access of transcription factors to the silent allele. This same mechanism thus seems likely to apply to the Xist promoter region. The silent allele in somatic cells is highly methylated, while the expressed allele is not methylated (14Norris D.P. Patel D. Kay G.F. Penny G.D. Brockdorff N. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Cell. 1994; 77: 41-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This difference is likely to be involved in maintenance by stabilizing alternate chromatin structure. We thank Drs. J. M. LeBon, S. Tommasi, R. Dammann, and G. P. Pfeifer for their kind help, A.

LTA4is then conjugated with either reduced glutathione to form LTC4 by the enzyme LTC4 synthase (6Penrose J.F. Gagnon L. Goppelt-Struebe M. Myers P. Lam B.K. Jack R.M. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. Proc.

Chem. 1984; 259: 12339-12345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the structural similarity between LTC4 synthase and FLAP, the intracellular location where this reaction most likely takes place is on the inner leaflet of the nuclear membrane (8Welsch D.J.

LTC4 formed at this location must then traverse the cell until it comes into association with the multidrug resistance-associated protein (10Lam B.K. Owen Jr., W.F. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12885-12889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Cole S.P.C. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. J. Biol.

Zaman G.J.R. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar), which mediates its export and that of other glutathione conjugates. The requirement for intracellular movement and subsequent export is shared with arachidonic acid metabolites of the PG family. PGH synthase-2 is located with its active site facing the interior of the nucleus (13Reiger M.K. DeWitt D.L. Schindler M.S. Smith W.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Morita I. Schindler M. Reiger M.K. Otto J.C. Hori T. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

These products in turn are exported from cells. PGD2 can also interact intracellularly with the γ form of the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor (15Yu K. Bayona W. Kallen C.B. Harding H.P.

These considerations suggest that LTC4 and glutathione conjugates formed intracellularly can potentially interact with a variety of intracellular proteins. To begin to understand the structural basis of these interactions we employed two photoaffinity ligands,S-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione-[125I]4-azidosalicylic acid (PNBG-[125I]ASA) and LTC4-[125I]4-azidosalicylic acid (LTC4-[125I]ASA), to identify the binding folds of proteins of membrane-associated proteins, which could recognize LTC4 and other glutathione conjugates. In studies with inside-out red blood cell vesicles, the major protein binding both probes was found to be glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Photoaffinity labeling of HL-60 cell cytosol also identified GAPDH as a protein binding LTC4. Isolation and sequencing of iodinated peptides from the erythrocyte membrane protein and V8 protease digestion of labeled, homogeneous GAPDH indicated that both probes bound to the NAD+ binding pocket, or Rossmann fold (18Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 19Singh R. Green M.R.

Antibodies to GAPDH were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Sirover, Temple University. Antibody to Rb(C36) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. ECL was purchased from DuPont NEN. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP (350 GBq/mmol) (ICN), [3H]LTC4 (4.9 GBq/mmol) (DuPont NEN) were purchased. PNBG-[125I]ASA and LTC4-[125I]ASA were synthesized by the New England Nuclear custom iodination group. Ten μg of NHS-ASA was iodinated by the IODOGEN method and prepared to a final radioactivity concentration of 16.4 mCi/0.6 ml. The iodinated NHS-ASA was split in two, and one half coupled to 100 μg ofS-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione for 2.5 h at room temperature and the product isolated by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Alternatively, the second half of the iodinated NHS-ASA was coupled to 50 μg of LTC4 overnight (Nicholson et al., 20) and the product isolated by RP-HPLC. Twenty ml of peripheral venous blood was obtained from healthy donors, mixed with 3 ml of acid citrate and 4 ml of 6% dextran 70 in 0.9% NaCl, and allowed to sediment by gravity. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were washed three times with five volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted at 2300 × g for 10 min after each wash. Hemolysis was performed in 40 volumes of 5 mm NaPO4 on ice for 2 min. Erythrocyte ghosts were pelleted at 22,000 × g for 10 min. Two additional wash cycles were performed. Membranes were vesiculated by resuspending the pellet in 0.5 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 12 h. The membranes were centrifuged at 28,000 ×g, resuspended in 0.5 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, and passed through a 27-gauge needle five times. Sixty mg of concanavalin A-agarose was equilibrated with 0.5 mm Tris and mixed with 20 mg of the membrane protein solution (50%, v/v) in a 50-ml conical tube and gently agitated for 10 min at room temperature (21Kondo T.

Biochem. 1982; 125: 551-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The mixture was then poured into a 12 × 1.5-cm column, and the inside-out vesicles were washed through with the same buffer. The vesicles were then collected by centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (207650) Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were cultured to a density of 106/ml in Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were then collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min and then washed three times in PBS. They were then resuspended at a concentration of 107/ml in either 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris HCl, 2 mm EDTA with 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml apoprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA for Western blotting or in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml apoprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm EDTA for photoaffinity labeling. For Western blotting the cells were disrupted to greater than 90% in a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer and then centrifuged first at 800 × g to remove unbroken cells and debris. The post-nuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, and then repeatedly aspirated through a 27-gauge needle to disperse it. For photoaffinity labeling the cells were disrupted in a sonicating water bath and then centrifuged as above. Microsomes were resuspended in labeling buffer. LTC4 and other glutathione conjugates are transported across membrane vesicles in an ATP-, Mg2+-, and temperature-dependent manner (10Lam B.K. Owen Jr., W.F. Austen K.F. Soberman R.J. J. Biol.

To determine the active transport of photoaffinity ligands, 6 pmol of PNBG-[125I]ASA or 3 pmol of LTC4-[125I]ASA was mixed with 10 mmTris, pH 7.5, and 250 mm sucrose in the presence or absence of 4 mm ATP and 20 mm MgCl2. The mixture was preincubated on ice or at 37 °C for 1 min. Uptake was initiated by the addition of 400 μg of erythrocyte membranes in a total volume of 250 μl. Fifty-μl aliquots were taken at time zero, 1, 5, 10, and 30 min, diluted in 2 ml of ice-cold buffer, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm sucrose, and immediately passed through presoaked nitrocellulose filters using a rapid filtration apparatus (Millipore). The filters were washed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold buffer. The filter radioactivity was then measured in a γ counter. In control experiments ATP was replaced with 4 mm AMP or 4 mm AMP-PCP. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was assayed spectrophotometrically by following the reduction of NAD+ at 340 nm (24Steck T.L. Kant J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). The assay contained 30 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 12 μm sodium arsenate, and 4 mmcysteine, pH 8.4. GAPDH (0.4 μg) was incubated in the above reaction mixture for 60 s and then mixed with varying concentrations of NAD+ (10–100 μm) for 30 s. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 150 μmglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate in a final reaction volume of 1 ml at 25 °C pH 8.4. All points were determined in duplicate at 30 s for calculations of initial velocity (V 0) using a Beckman DU-64 spectrophotometer by measuring the change in absorbance at 340 nm or with the use of a molar extinction coefficient of 6.3 × 103. For inhibitor studies varying concentrations of SPNBG (100 μm to 1 mm) were included in the reaction mixture before the addition of GAPDH. Fifty μg of RBC membrane vesicles were mixed with 0.4 pmol of PNBG-[125I]ASA, 1.0 pmol of LTC4-[125I]ASA, or 75 pmol of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in 0.5 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (final volume of 250 μl), in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube with the cap removed, chilled on ice for 10 min, and then exposed to long wave UV light (360 nm) for 7 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g and the supernatant discarded. The membranes were then solubilized in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue. Proteins were then separated by 10% SDS-PAGE using Bio-Rad Tris-glycine minigels and identified by either staining with 1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue or by silver staining. Photoaffinity-labeled proteins were subsequently identified by autoradiography. Experiments labeling HL-60 cytosol with LTC4-[125I]ASA were performed identically except that 250 μg of protein were used. Photoaffinity-labeled erythrocyte membrane proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to PVDF membranes in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.3, 20% methanol, in a Bio-Rad mini blotting apparatus at 100 V (constant) for 1 h. The membranes were stained with a solution of 0.5% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid for 5 min and then destained with 1% acetic acid until the background was minimal, and then evaluated by autoradiography. Approximately 16 μg of the photoaffinity-labeled 38-kDa protein was transferred to PVDF membranes. The membrane containing the protein was cut out and the protein digested in situ with lysyl endopeptidase at the Whitehead Protein Sequencing Facility. The peptide fragments were separated by RP-HPLC (HP1090 m) using a Vydac 2.1 × 250-mm C18 column and fractions collected by hand. Radiolabeled peaks were identified by γ counting of each fraction and were analyzed on a gas phase microsequencer (model 475, Applied Biosystems, Inc.) at the Whitehead Protein Sequencing Facility. Peptide searches were made using the BLAST program. HL-60 proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted as above, except that nitrocellulose membranes were used. For Western blotting these were then blocked in 3% nonfat dried milk in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then washed for 10 min three times in PBS. Antibody was added in 3% nonfat dried milk in PBS and allowed to react for 1 h at room temp. Following washing, the membranes were developed by ECL and exposed for 1 min prior to development. 250 μg of dialyzed cytosol was photoaffinity-labeled as described above. After labeling, the cytosol was concentrated to 30 μl in a Centricon concentrator and then suspended to a volume of 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml apoprotinin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm/ml EDTA. Immunoprecipitation was then performed using anti-GAPDH antibody and anti-Rb(C36) as a control following the protein G-agarose protocol of Boehringer Mannheim. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Five μg of purified erythrocyte GAPDH was chilled on ice with 2.0 pmol of PNBG-[125I]ASA or 5 pmol of LTC4-[125I]ASA, and varying concentrations of unlabeled competitors in a volume of 100 μl of 0.5 mmTris, pH 7.5. The mixture was photolyzed and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and autoradiography. Four μg of erythrocyte GAPDH was labeled with either PNBG-[125I]ASA or LTC4-[125I]ASA as described above. The buffer was exchanged to a final volume of 100 μl of 50 mmNH4HCO3 and 15 mm KCl by three cycles of dilution to 2 ml and concentration to 100 μl in a Centricon 10 concentrator. The protein was digested with 4 μg of V8 protease for 2 h at 37 °C. Digested or undigested GAPDH was mixed with sample buffer containing 200 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 40% glycerol, 2% SDS, 2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.04% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and the peptides and/or undigested enzyme resolved in 16.5% Tris/Tricine minigels (18Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol.

Photoaffinity-labeled peptides and proteins were then identified by autoradiography. [3H]LTC4 (8.5 KBq, 20 nm) was incubated with 4 μg of erythrocyte GAPDH in 0.5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 10 min at 37 °C, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and irradiated at 360 nm for 7 min (11Leier I.

The labeled protein was mixed with SDS loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. To locate the peptide incorporating the radioactivity, stained bands were excised and incubated with 0.5 ml of deionized water and 0.5 ml of Solvable for 3 h at 50 °C, mixed with Formula 989 scintillation mixture, and then radioactivity quantitated by scintillation counting in a Packard 1500 Tri-Carb liquid scintillation counter. To determine the glutathione conjugate binding sites of proteins that regulate trafficking of LTC4 and other glutathione conjugates, we identified membrane proteins that were photoaffinity-labeled with both of the probes shown in Fig.1, and also with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. The latter was chosen to identify the nucleotide binding site of potential ATP-binding cassette carrier proteins. The membrane initially chosen for these studies and to test the probes was human erythrocyte inside out vesicles. Erythrocyte membranes export glutathione conjugates (21Kondo T. Dale G.L. Beutler E.

A. 1994; 91: 13033-13037Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar), are simple in composition, and are available in large quantities. We initially determined whether the photoaffinity ligands were actively transported by erythrocyte membranes. The uptake of PNBG-[125I]ASA and LTC4-[125I]ASA both increased over a period of 1–5 min in the presence of ATP and then leveled off over the next 25 min (data not shown). In the absence of ATP, or Mg2+, or when AMP-PCP or AMP was substituted for ATP no uptake was observed. When 3 pmol of PNBG-[125I]ASA was used as a substrate, 157 fmol (mean, n = 2) was taken up at 1 min, whereas in the absence of ATP only 43.5 fmol was associated with the vesicles. When 6 pmol of LTC4-[125I]ASA was added in a reaction, 194 fmol was taken up at 1 min, whereas 36 fmol was associated with vesicles in the absence of ATP. These data indicated that these ligands were actively imported by erythrocyte membrane vesicles. Erythrocyte membranes were then incubated on ice with PNBG-[125I]ASA or LTC4-[125I]ASA, photolyzed with UV light, separated by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and analyzed by autoradiography (Fig.2 A). One major band of 38 kDa was observed to be photoaffinity-labeled with LTC4-[125I]ASA (lane 1) or PNBG-[125I]ASA (lane 2). A minor band was observed at 190 kDa under both circumstances, and at 80 kDa using LTC4-[125I]ASA as the probe. Labeling with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP showed multiple bands (Fig.2 B, lane 1), but included one at 38 kDa.Lane 2 shows that a single band is identified in these membranes by labeling with PNBG-[125I]ASA. To identify the prominent 38-kDa protein, erythrocyte membranes were labeled with PNBG-[125I]ASA and then electroblotted to PVDF membranes. After staining with Ponceau S, ∼16 μg of protein was digested in situ with lysyl endopeptidase and the resulting peptides separated by RP-HPLC. Fractions corresponding to OD peaks were collected by hand and then analyzed by γ counting. Two fractions (54 and 56) were found to contain radioactivity. Sequencing was able to identify the 11 N-terminal amino acids of the peptide collected in peak 54. When analyzed by the BLAST program, these amino acids could be aligned with amino acids 119–129 of human liver GAPDH as shown in Table I, with an identity of 7/11 residues. When the peptide in Peak 56 was analyzed in the same manner, it could be aligned with an identity of 11/11 amino acids for amino acids 67 to 77 of liver GAPDH (Table I). Both peptides are contained in the NAD+ binding region of the protein (18Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 19Singh R. Green M.R.

PNBG-[125I]ASA photolabeling was inhibited ∼50% by 10 μm ATP and completely at a concentration of 100 μm. One hundred μm NAD+inhibited labeling by this compound by greater than 50%, and 10 mm NAD+ almost completely inhibited labeling. Photoaffinity labeling of GAPDH by LTC4-[125I]ASA was inhibited by ∼50% with 1 μm ATP and almost completely at 10 μm ATP. Photoaffinity labeling with this probe was essentially abolished at 10 μm and 100 μm NAD+. To confirm that glutathione conjugates that were not derivatized as photoaffinity labels interacted with the active site of GAPDH, we determined the K ifor S-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione of GAPDH enzymatic activity. Fig. 4 shows the results of one of two experiments. For two experiments the K i was found to be 379 μm ± 6 (mean ± S.D.,n = 2).Figure 4Inhibition of GAPDH activity. Secondary plot of slopes versus S-(p-nitrobenzoyl)glutathione concentration used to determine the K i. The slopes were obtained from from Lineweaver-Burke plots calculated at different concentrations ofS-(p-nitrobenzoyl)glutathione.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because the peptide sequence of the 38-kDa protein was obtained with membranes labeled with the PNBG-[125I]ASA probe, we utilized the ability of V8 protease to cleave GAPDH into its NAD+and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate binding domains to provide additional confirmation that LTC4-[125I]ASA bound to the Rossmann fold. Four micrograms of enzyme were photoaffinity-labeled with either PNBG-[125I]ASA or LTC4-[125I]ASA. Two micrograms of each labeled aliquot were digested with V8 protease. Digested and undigested enzyme were resolved by 16.5% Tris/Tricine gels and then analyzed by silver staining (Fig. 5 A) followed by autoradiography (Fig. 5 B). Undigested enzyme labeled with LTC4-[125I]ASA or PNBG-[125I]ASA is represented by a single band of 38 kDa when analyzed by either silver staining or autoradiography. When digestion with V8 protease was performed for 2 h, two major fragments could be identified by silver staining at ∼8.8 and 6.8 kDa, the latter known to contain the NAD+ binding site (18Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). GAPDH was cleaved by V8 protease so that radioactivity from both probes was identically distributed. A minority was localized to the remaining uncut protein, and the majority associated with the 6.8-kDa fragment containing the NAD+binding site. The ability of [3H]LTC4 to label GAPDH was then examined by the same approach except that bands were labeled with Coomassie Blue and then protein extracted with Solvable prior to analysis by β-scintillation counting. In two experiments, all the radioactivity was distributed identically to that of the photoaffinity ligands, indicating that a natural ligand bound to the same site as the photoaffinity label (data not shown). We next determined whether GAPDH in nucleated cells could interact with LTC4-[125I]ASA. In initial experiments, HL-60 cell fractions were analyzed by Western blotting to determine the distribution of GAPDH. Small amounts were found in the membrane fraction, and greater than 96% in the cytosol. Cytosol was then dialyzed against labeling buffer, labeled with LTC4-[125I]ASA, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Two bands were identified, one with the identical size to GAPDH at 38 kDa and a second at∼ 27 kDa (Fig. 6). To confirm the identity of the 38-kDa protein, labeled cytosol was precipitated with antibody to GAPDH. A single band was found at 38 kDa (Fig. 6 C), which was not seen with control antibody. Although GAPDH was found in the membrane fraction, this could not be successfully labeled. In addition, this small fraction could only be dissociated by the use of detergent, unlike the erythrocyte enzyme, which is released by salt (26Tsai I.-H. Murthy S.N.P. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1438-1442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling of inner erythrocyte membranes by PNBG-[125I]ASA or LTC4-[125I]ASA (Fig.1) showed one predominant protein at 38 kDa and a second less intense band at 190 kDa (Fig. 2 A). When analyzed by one-dimensional electrophoresis, the predominant 38-kDa protein appeared to also be labeled with 8-azido-[32P]ATP (Fig. 2 B). The strategy of labeling with two different probes was employed to identify members of the ATP-binding cassette family. However, carrier proteins that move midsize molecules contain at least six transmembrane domains and are at least 60 kDa in size (27Kaplan J.H. Cell. 1993; 72: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The size of 38 kDa was considered too small for such a protein. Because of its prominence, the 38-kDa band photolabeled with PNBG-[125I]ASA was sequenced directly, with the assumption that even if there were several co-migrating proteins, labeled peptides could be isolated after digestion and sequenced. This approach proved viable in that only two peptides were identified after lysyl endopeptidase digestion and isolation by RP-HPLC. Peak 56 had 100% identity to liver GAPDH, whereas peak 54 was identical with 7/11 amino acids. As shown in Table I, the degree of identity between liver and muscle GAPDH is similar (8/11) to that between liver GAPDH and peak 54, further suggesting that the labeled protein is erythrocyte GAPDH (which has yet to be cloned). The identification of the binding of LTC4-[125I]ASA as well as PNBG-[125I]ASA to the 6.8-kDa V8 protease fragment further indicates that both labels bind to the same site (Fig. 5). The relevance to the natural ligands is demonstrated by the fact that [3H]LTC4 photolabels the same 6.8-kDa peptide as the iodinated probes. Three lines of evidence indicate that both photoaffinity labels bind to the NAD+ binding site of GAPDH. First, the peptide mapping is the same; second, the binding of both probes is competitively inhibited with both NAD+ and ATP (Fig. 3); third, the parent compounds of the probes; and fourth,S-(p-nitrobenzyl)glutathione competitively inhibits GAPDH activity. When peptide mapping was performed, LTC4-125I-ASA and PNBG-[125I]ASA were localized to the fragment that contains the 62 N-terminal amino acids (Fig. 5). The identification of this peptide has been previously confirmed by sequencing (18Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). However, the two peptides identified by direct sequencing in this report lie C-terminal to this region, but still within the NAD+ binding site. One possible explanation for this is that either the membrane associations or protein interactions of GAPDH determine the orientation of PNBG-[125I]ASA and LTC4-[125I]ASA within the Rossmann fold, allowing them to cross-link to different residues. The ability of GAPDH to alter the properties of its catalytic site depending on its environment is supported by the observations that the independent 38-kDa subunits function as a DNA glycosylase rather than a glycolytic enzyme (28Meyer-Siegler K. Mauro D.J. Seal G. Wurzer J. deRiel J.K. Sirover M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and that the ability of the enzyme to bind RNA is determined by its redox state (18Nagy E. Rigby W.F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2755-2763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Alternatively, GAPDH may have a membrane association with a specific integral membrane protein, which could bind and then pass the labels to the Rossmann fold. GAPDH has been shown to associate with erythrocyte Band 3 (29Kliman H.J. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6314-6321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the glucose transporter (30Lachaal M. Berenski C.J. Kim J. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15449-15454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, no protein corresponding to the size of either carrier was labeled. Therefore, if such a mechanism were operative, then the transfer to GAPDH would have be both highly efficient and specific in terms of the orientation of the proteins. The ability of GAPDH to serve as a binding protein for LTC4in nucleated cells was demonstrated in HL-60 cytosol (Fig. 6). Although the identity of the second labeled protein of 27 kDa was not pursued, it is possible that it is the human homologue of the rat Ya glutathioneS-transferase subunit which has been shown to bind LTC4 (31Sun F.F. Chau L.-Y. Spur B. Corey E.J. Lewis R.A. Austen K.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8540-8546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lack of labeling of the small membrane-bound component of GAPDH could represent a further change in enzyme configuration of this tightly bound form so that binding cannot occur."
