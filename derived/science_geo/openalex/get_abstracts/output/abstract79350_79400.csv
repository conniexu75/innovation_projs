https://openalex.org/W2071450550,Electroconvulsive shock given to rats immediately after one-trial avoidance learning produced a significant amnesic effect 24 hours later; this amnesia had largely disappeared in further retention tests 48 and 72 hours after treatment. This result puts in question a basic assumption implicit in most memory consolidation studies that such amnesic effects will be permanent.

The leakage of swelling solution out of such myelinoid lipid-water dispersions was, however, linearly related to the proportion of ethanolamine phosphoglyceride."
