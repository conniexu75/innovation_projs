https://openalex.org/W4226196963,"Multi-strain pandemics have emerged as a major concern. We introduce a new model for assessing the connection between multi-strain pandemics and mortality rate, basic reproduction number, and maximum infected individuals. The proposed model provides a general mathematical approach for representing multi-strain pandemics, generalizing for an arbitrary number of strains. We show that the proposed model fits well with epidemiological historical world health data over a long time period. From a theoretical point of view, we show that the increasing number of strains increases logarithmically the maximum number of infected individuals and the mean mortality rate. Moreover, the mean basic reproduction number is statistically identical to the single, most aggressive pandemic strain for multi-strain pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W4226426842,"In recent years, China's industrial economy has grown rapidly and steadily. Concurrently, carbon emissions have gradually increased, among which agricultural production is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions. It is necessary to reduce agricultural carbon emissions by improving their efficiency to achieve the global goal of peak carbon dioxide emissions in 2030. From a dynamic and static point of view, this study puts agricultural carbon emissions into the evaluation index system of agricultural carbon emission efficiency and analyzes the agricultural carbon emission efficiency and its influencing factors in Hubei Province. First, the unexpected output Slacks-based measure (SBM) model in data envelopment analysis was used to evaluate the agricultural carbon emission efficiency of Hubei Province in 2018 and compared it with other provinces horizontally. Second, the Malmquist-Luenberger index was used to analyze the comprehensive efficiency of agricultural carbon emissions in Hubei Province from 2004 to 2018. The role of technological progress and technical efficiency change in the development of low-carbon agriculture in Hubei Province was analyzed. The results showed that agricultural production efficiency in Hubei Province improved from 2004 to 2018, and the overall level was slightly higher than the average level in China. However, agriculture has not eliminated the extensive development modes of high input, low efficiency, high emission, and high pollution. The efficiency of technological progress in agricultural resource utilization in Hubei Province was close to the optimal level. The improvement space was small. Hence, the low efficiency of agricultural technology is a key factor restricting the improvement of agricultural production efficiency. The results provide a reference for low-carbon agricultural policy formulation and expand the policy choice path. This has practical significance."
https://openalex.org/W4225832465,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common cause of vaginitis, but the national burden is unknown, and clinical diagnosis without diagnostic testing is often inaccurate. We aimed to calculate rates and evaluate diagnosis and treatment practices of VVC and recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) in the United States. We used the 2018 IBM® MarketScan® Research Databases, which include health insurance claims data on outpatient visits and prescriptions for >28 million people. We used diagnosis and procedure codes to examine underlying conditions, vaginitis-related symptoms and conditions, diagnostic testing, and antibacterial and antifungal treatment among female patients with VVC. Among 12.3 million female patients in MarketScan, 149,934 (1.2%) had a diagnosis code for VVC; of those, 3.4% had RVVC. The VVC rate was highest in the South census region (14.3 per 1,000 female patients) and lowest in the West (9.9 per 1000). Over 60% of patients with VVC did not have codes for any diagnostic testing, and microscopy was the most common test type performed in 29.5%. Higher rates of diagnostic testing occurred among patients who visited an OB/GYN (53.4%) compared with a family practice or internal medicine provider (24.2%) or other healthcare provider types (31.9%); diagnostic testing rates were lowest in the South (34.0%) and highest in the Midwest (41.0%). Treatments on or in the 7 days after diagnosis included systemic fluconazole (70.0%), topical antifungal medications (19.4%), and systemic antibacterial medications (17.2%). The low frequencies of diagnostic testing for VVC and high rates of antifungal and antibacterial use suggest substantial empiric treatment, including likely overprescribing of antifungal medications and potentially unnecessary antibacterial medications. These findings support a need for improved clinical care for VVC to improve both patient outcomes and antimicrobial stewardship, particularly in the South and among non-OB/GYN providers."
https://openalex.org/W4225016482,"The purposes of this study were to evaluate the mental health among patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) and to explore its' influencing factors. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Liaoning Province, China. A total of 200 patients volunteered to participate in the survey. Psycho-social variables included stress, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support. logistic regression analysis was used to explore the effect of psycho-social factors on depression and anxiety in DR patients. The prevalence of depression and anxiety was 25% and 13.5% among DR patients. Regression analysis showed that social support had a significant protective effect on depression (95%CI 0.931-0.997) and anxiety (95%CI 0.900-0.995). Stress had a significant acceleration of depression (95%CI 1.055-1.253) and anxiety (95%CI 1.120-1.457). Family history of diabetes (95%CI 1.856-18.057) and other chronic diseases (95%CI 1.485-12.508) were risk factors for anxiety. The high prevalence of depression (25.0%) and anxiety (13.5%) among DR patients should receive more attention in Chinese medical settings. Stress, social support, family history of diabetes and other chronic diseases seemed to be crucial in relation to depressive symptoms. Efficient interventions such as improving social support and decreasing stress with patients should be considered by health administrators aiming at alleviating depressive and anxiety among Chinese DR patients."

They are known as the factories of multipotent metabolites with diverse bioactivities beneficial to modern pharmaceuticals industry. Endophytic fungi have been screened from a variety of plants and it is the first-time endophytes of club moss is being studied for production of antibacterial and antioxidative compounds. The present study reveals that Lycopodium clavatum L. harbors a potent niche of bioactive endophytic fungi and Colletotrichum alatae LCS1 was the prime producer of antibacterial and antioxidative compounds among them. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations of ethyl- acetate culture extract ranged from 15.62 to 250 μg/mL against four Gram negative and three Gram positive microorganisms including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-33591). Bio-autogram based screening followed by Gas chromatographic analysis confirmed the occurrence of 17 bioactive compounds and α-bisabolol is known to be the prime one. Alfa bisabolol is a unique and versatile bioactive essential oil and facilitates variety of functions. Killing kinetics data along with leakage of macromolecules into extracellular environment supports the cidal activity of the antibacterial principles at MBC values. Isolate C . alatae LCS1 was optimized by one variable at a time system coupled with response surface methodology for broad spectrum antibacterial production. The organism yielded maximum response (22.66±0.894 mm of zone of inhibition against MRSA) in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL potato dextrose broth supplemented with (g/L) glucose, 7.53; yeast extract concentration, 0.47; NaCl, 0.10 with medium pH 6.46; after 134 hours of incubation at 26°C. Optimized fermentation parameters enhanced antibacterial activity up-to more than 50% than the pre-optimized one (10.33±0.57 mm). Endophytic LCS1 was also efficient in free radical scavenging tested by DPPH, ABTS, H 2 O 2 and FRAP assay with an IC 50 values of 23.38±5.32 to 82.873±6.479 μg/mL."
https://openalex.org/W4225996490,"Environmental conditions contribute to plant growth and metabolism. This study aimed to determine a suitable environment and climate for large-scale artificial cultivation of an endangered plant, Tetrastigma hemsleyanum, by investigating the seasonal variations influencing the flavonoid biosynthetic selectivity and antioxidant activity of its major metabolites. Under conditions of precipitation (2.0~6.6 mm), temperature (17.5~24.1°C), humidity (67.3~80.2%), and sunshine duration (3.4~5.8 h) from April to May, the total flavonoid content in T. hemsleyanum reached higher levels between 281.3 and 392.8 μg/g. In the second half of April, the production selectivity (PS) of isoorientin (IsoO), orientin (Or), rutin (Rut), isoquercitin (IsoQ), kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside (Km3rut), astragalin (Ast), quercetin (Qu), apigenin (Ap), and kaempferol (Km) were 0.30, 0.06, 0.07, 0.07, 0.00, 0.04, 0.38, 0.05, and 0.03, respectively. Naringenin was dehydrogenated or hydroxylated to initiate two parallel reaction pathways for flavonoid biosynthesis in T. hemsleyanum: path I subsequently generated flavone derivatives including apigenin, luteolin, orientin, and isoorientin, and path II subsequently generated flavonol derivatives including Km, Qu, IsoQ, Rut, Ast, and Km3rut. The reaction selectivity of path II (RPSII) from January 1 to September 30 was considerably higher than that of path I (RPSI), except for March 16-31. In addition, either the content or antioxidant activity of three major metabolites in T. hemsleyanum followed the order of phenolic compounds > polysaccharides > sterols, and exhibited dynamic correlations with environmental factors. Naringenin favored hydroxylation and derived six flavonol compounds from January to September, and favored dehydrogenation and derived three flavone compounds from October to December. In most months of a year, Km preferentially favored hydroxylation rather than glucosylation."
https://openalex.org/W4226208232,"Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has put hospital workers around the world in an unprecedented and difficult situation, possibly leading to emotional difficulties and mental health problems. We aimed to analyze psychological symptoms of the hospital employees of the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group a few months after the 1st wave of the pandemic. Participants and methods From July 15 to October 1, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among hospital workers in the two locations of our hospital group using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL) to measure anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms. Factors independently associated with these symptoms were identified. Results In total, 780 participants (47% caregivers, 18% health administrative workers, 16% physicians, and 19% other professionals) completed the survey. Significant symptoms of anxiety, depression, and PTSD were reported by 41%, 21%, and 14% of the participants, respectively. Hierarchical regression analysis showed a higher risk of having psychological symptoms among those (1) who were infected by SARS-CoV-2 or had colleagues or relatives infected by the virus, (2) who retrospectively reported to have had an anxious experience during the first wave, and (3) with a previous history of burnout or depression. In contrast, job satisfaction appeared to be a protective factor. Overall, hospital workers showed the statistically same levels of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms, regardless of their profession and whether they had worked in units with COVID-19 patients or not. Conclusions Our cross-sectional survey of 780 hospital workers shows that after the first wave, hospital employees had a significant burden of mental health symptoms. Specific preventive measures to promote mental well-being among hospital workers exposed to COVID-19 need to be implemented, first among particularly vulnerable staff, and then, for all hospital staff for whom anxiety is detected early, and not only those who were directly exposed to infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W4226267509,"Topic modeling is a popular technique for exploring large document collections. It has proven useful for this task, but its application poses a number of challenges. First, the comparison of available algorithms is anything but simple, as researchers use many different datasets and criteria for their evaluation. A second challenge is the choice of a suitable metric for evaluating the calculated results. The metrics used so far provide a mixed picture, making it difficult to verify the accuracy of topic modeling outputs. Altogether, the choice of an appropriate algorithm and the evaluation of the results remain unresolved issues. Although many studies have reported promising performance by various topic models, prior research has not yet systematically investigated the validity of the outcomes in a comprehensive manner, that is, using more than a small number of the available algorithms and metrics. Consequently, our study has two main objectives. First, we compare all commonly used, non-application-specific topic modeling algorithms and assess their relative performance. The comparison is made against a known clustering and thus enables an unbiased evaluation of results. Our findings show a clear ranking of the algorithms in terms of accuracy. Secondly, we analyze the relationship between existing metrics and the known clustering, and thus objectively determine under what conditions these algorithms may be utilized effectively. This way, we enable readers to gain a deeper understanding of the performance of topic modeling techniques and the interplay of performance and evaluation metrics."
https://openalex.org/W4226458216,"User committees, such as Health Facility Governing Committees, are popular platforms for representing communities and civil society in holding service providers accountable. Fiscal decentralization via various arrangements such as Direct Health Facility Financing is thought to strengthen Health Facility Governing Committees in improving accountability in carrying out the devolved tasks and mandates. The purpose of this study was to analyze the status of accountability of Health Facility Governing Committees in Tanzania under the Direct Health Facility Financing setting as perceived by the supply side. In 32 different health institutions, a cross-sectional design was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data at one point in time. Data was collected through a closed-ended questionnaire, an in-depth interview, and a Focus Group Discussion. Descriptive statistics, multiple logistic regression, and theme analysis were used to analyze the data. According to the findings, Health Facility Governing Committees' accountability is 78%. Committees have a high level of accountability in terms of encouraging the community to join community health funds (91.71%), receiving medicines and medical commodities (88.57%), and providing timely health services (84.29%). The health facility governance committee's responsibility was shown to be substantially connected with the health planning component (p = 0.0048) and the financial management aspect (p = 0.0045). This study found that the fiscal decentralization setting permits Committees to be accountable for carrying out their obligations, resulting in improved health service delivery in developing nations."
https://openalex.org/W4225733743,"Insomnia is the most common of the sleep disorders. Current pharmacotherapy treatment options are usually associated with adverse effects and withdrawal phenomena. Therapeutic alternatives with a more favorable safety profile for patients are needed. Mongolian medical warm acupuncture (MMWA) is an emerging therapeutic option for treating insomnia. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the anti-insomnia efficacy of the MMWA remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of the MMWA on the alterations of the gut microbiota and serum metabolome in rats with insomnia.We found that the relative abundances of gut bacteria and the concentrations of several serum metabolites were obviously altered in PCPA-induced insomnia rats. The MMWA treatment exerted an anti-insomnia effect. In addition, the dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and the serum metabolites were ameliorated by the MMWA. Correlation analysis between the gut microbiota and metabolites suggested that the levels of Amide c18, Benzoyl chloride, Cytosine, and N, n-dimethylarginine were positively correlated with the relative abundance of Clostridium XlVa and Blautia, which characterized the insomnia rats. KEGG enrichment analysis identified the cAMP signaling pathway involving anti-insomnia effect of the MMWA. Moreover, the MMWA intervention significantly increased contents of butyrate in feces, while effectively inhibited the expression level of GAT-1 in brain tissues.This study reveals that the MMWA intervention might have a major impact on the modulation of host gut microbiota and metabolites, which in turn have a crucial role in the regulation of the host's signaling pathways associated with insomnia. The present study could provide useful ideas for the study of the intervention mechanisms of the MMWA in insomnia rat models."
https://openalex.org/W4225342199,"The Atlantic Forest harbors 7% of global biodiversity and possesses high levels of endemism, but many of its component taxa remain unstudied. Due to the importance of tropical forests and the urgency to protect them, there is a compelling need to address this knowledge gap. To provide more information on its arthropod fauna, a Malaise trap was deployed for 12 months in a semi-degraded area of the southern Upper Paraná ecoregion of the Atlantic Forest. All specimens were DNA barcoded and the Barcode Index Number (BIN) system was employed to assign each specimen to a species proxy. DNA barcodes were obtained from 75,500 arthropods that included representatives of 8,651 BINs. Nearly 81% of these BINs were first records, highlighting the high rates of endemism and lack of study of arthropods from the Atlantic Forest. Diptera was the most abundant order, followed by Hemiptera, Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera. Diptera was also the most species-rich order, followed by Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Coleoptera, a result consistent with studies in other biogeographic regions. Insects were most abundant in winter and most diverse in autumn and winter. This pattern, however, was caused mainly by the dynamics of dipteran diversity as other orders differed in their seasonal variation. The BIN composition of the insect community varied sharply through the year and also differed between the two consecutive summers included in the sampling period. The study of the 38 commonest BINs showed that seasonal patterns of abundance were not order-specific. Temperature had the strongest impact on seasonal abundance variation. Our results highlight the striking and understudied arthropod diversity of the highly fragmented Atlantic Forest, the predominance of dipterans, and the fact that abundance and richness in this insect community peak in the coolest months. Standardized studies like this generate fast and reliable biodiversity inventories and unveil ecological patterns, thus providing valuable information for conservation programs."

Here we present a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of ADP-bound Escherichia coli RadD, revealing a zinc-ribbon element that was not modelled in a previous RadD crystal structure. Insights into the mode of nucleotide binding and additional structure refinement afforded by the new RadD model will help to drive investigations into the activity of RadD as a genome stability and repair factor."
https://openalex.org/W4226141385,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with thrombosis. We conducted a cohort study of consecutive patients, suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection presented to the emergency department. We investigated haemostatic differences between SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative patients, with dedicated coagulation analysis. The 519 included patients had a median age of 66 years, and 52.5% of the patients were male. Twenty-six percent of the patients were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2.PCR positive patients had increased levels of fibrinogen and (active) von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and decreased levels of protein C and α2-macroglobulin compared to the PCR negative patients. In addition, we found acquired activated protein C resistance in PCR positive patients. Furthermore, we found that elevated levels of factor VIII and VWF and decreased levels of ADAMTS-13 were associated with an increased incidence of thrombosis in PCR positive patients. In conclusion, we found that PCR positive patients had a pronounced prothrombotic phenotype, mainly due to an increase of endothelial activation upon admission to the hospital. These findings show that coagulation tests may be considered useful to discriminate severe cases of COVID-19 at risk for thrombosis."
https://openalex.org/W4226305432,"Transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) is an effective non-invasive spinal cord electrical stimulation technique to induce neuromodulation of local and distal neural circuits of the central nervous system (CNS). Applied to the spinal cord lumbosacral region, tsDCS changes electrophysiological responses of the motor, proprioceptive and nociceptive pathways, alters the performance of some lower limb motor tasks and can even modulate the behavior of supramedullary neuronal networks. In this study an experimental protocol was conducted to verify if tsDCS (5 mA, 20 minutes) of two different polarizations, applied over the lumbosacral region (tenth thoracic vertebrae (T10)), can induce changes in postural sway oscillations of young healthy individuals during quiet standing. A novel initialization of the electrical stimulation was developed to improve subject blinding to the different stimulus conditions including the sham trials. Measures of postural sway, both global and structural, were computed before, during and following the DC stimulation period. The results indicated that, for the adopted conditions, tsDCS did not induce statistically significant changes in postural sway of young healthy individuals during quiet standing."
https://openalex.org/W4225503838,"Efficient use of nitrogen (N) is essential to protect water quality in high-input organic vegetable production systems, but little is known about the long-term effects of organic management on N mass balances. We measured soil N and tabulated N inputs (organic fertilizers, compost, irrigation water, atmospheric deposition, cover crop seed, vegetable transplant plugs and fixation by legume cover crops) and exports in harvested crops (lettuce, broccoli) over eight years to calculate soil surface and soil system N mass balances for the Salinas Organic Cropping Systems study in Salinas, CA. Our objectives were to 1) quantify the long-term effects of compost, cover crop frequency and cover crop type on soil N, cover crop and vegetable crop N uptake, and yield, and 2) tabulate N balances to assess the effects of these factors on N export in harvested crops, soil N storage and potential N loss. Results show that across all systems only 13 to 23% of N inputs were exported in harvest. Annual compost applications increased soil N stocks but had little effect on vegetable N uptake or yield, increasing the cumulative soil system N balance surplus over eight years by 999 kg ha-1, relative to the system receiving organic fertilizers alone. Annually planted winter cover crops increased N availability, crop uptake and export; however, biological N fixation by legumes negated the positive effect of increased harvest exports on the balance surplus in the legume-rye cover cropped system. Over eight years, rye cover crops improved system performance and reduced the cumulative N surplus by 384 kg ha-1 relative to the legume-rye mixture by increasing N retention and availability without increasing N inputs. Reduced reliance on external compost inputs and increased use of annually planted non-legume cover crops can improve efficient N use and cropping system yield, consequently improving environmental performance."
https://openalex.org/W4225644331,"Target seedling cultivation pursues high quality and nutrient utilization instead of increasing growth and size. Exposure to light-emitting diode (LED) spectra is a well-known approach that can accelerate growing speed in tree seedlings, but it is still unknown whether seedling quality and nutrient utilization would be further improved with exogeneous polymer additives. Luohan pine (Podocarpus macrophyllus) seedlings were exposed to red (red-green-blue lights, 71.7%-13.7%-14.6%), green (26.2%-56.4%-17.4%), and blue (17.8%-33.7%-48.5%) LED-light spectra with half receiving leaf spray by chitosan oligosaccharides (Cos) at a rate of 2 ppm (w/w) and the other half receiving only water. The red-light spectrum promoted height, biomass, nutrient utilization, and quality assessment (DQI) in water-sprayed seedlings. The Cos spray enhanced fine-root growth, protein, and chlorophyll-b contents with elevated nutrient utilization and quality in seedlings in the green-light spectrum. DQI was found to have a positive relationship with phosphorus utilization. In conclusion, although the red-light LED spectrum can promote seedling growth, green light combined with Cos spray is recommended with the aim of maintaining seedling quality and increasing P utilization in Luohan pine seedlings."
https://openalex.org/W4226143555,"A new mathematical model is proposed for the analysis of thermo-mechanics effects during isochoric cryopreservation. In that process, some ice crystallization in a fixed-volume container drives pressure elevation, which may be favorable to the preservation of biological material when it resides in the unfrozen portion of the same container. The proposed model is comprehensive, integrating for the first time concepts from the disparate fields of thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, and solid mechanics. The novelty in this study is in treating the cryopreserved material as having a pseudo-viscoelastic behavior over a very narrow temperature range, without affecting the mechanical behavior of the material in the rest of the domain. This unique approach permits treating the domain as a continuum, while avoiding the need to trace freezing fronts and sperate the analysis to liquid and solid subdomains. Consistent with the continuum approach, the heat transfer problem is solved using the enthalpy approach. The presented analysis focusses on isochoric cooling of pure water between standard atmospheric conditions and the triple point of liquid water, ice Ih, and ice III (-22°C and 207.4 MPa). The proposed model is also applicable to isochoric vitrification, by substituting the pseudo-viscoelastic material model with the real viscosity model of the vitrifying material. Results of this study display good agreement with phase-diagram data at steady state, and with experimental data from the literature. Furthermore, this study provides a venue to discussing experimentation aspects of isochoric cryopreservation. The proposed model is further demonstrated on a 3D problem, while discussing scale considerations, crystallization conditions, and transient effects. Notably, the new model can be used to bridge the gap between limited pressure and temperature measurements during cryopreservation and the analysis of the continuum. Arguably, this study presents the most advanced thermo-mechanics model to solve practical problems relating to isochoric cryopreservation."
https://openalex.org/W4226166985,"By exploring the China International Fair for Investment and Trade's development process, this study analyzes its absolute advantages in future development, gradually lost comparative advantages, and potential crises. Through the data envelopment analysis model, the study analyzes its resource allocation efficiency based on two cooperation modes: traditional ""Offline"" investment mode and ""Online + Offline"" investment mode. Then we use vector autoregressive model to comprehensively investigate the impact and causality of the two input factors on output. We find that its comprehensive allocation efficiency presents a ""U"" shape that reflects the characteristics of its three stages: the first stage, 2001-2005; the second stage, 2006-2012; and the third stage, 2013-2020. The main factors affecting resource allocation efficiency are then deduced from the results: exhibition scale utilization, booth design innovation, project strength of participating enterprises, and the signing rate of overseas customers. The number of industrial and commercial groups (X4) and participating countries and regions (X6) have an important impact on the output indicators: signed contract projects (Y1). The empirical results verify that the ""Online + Offline"" investment mode is an effective and suitable mechanism to solve the problem of cooperation and investment constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the results of empirical analysis, this study posits the path and countermeasures of realizing the transformation to ""cloud"" exhibition in the post-pandemic era. Especially, we should focus on building new mechanisms of business environment that will promote the active participation of national, regional, and international industrial and commercial groups. The purpose is to continuously strengthen the foundation of cooperative trust and innovate a new trust model of online cooperative trading."

We have developed the LAMP colorimetric assays for the detection of these two thalassemia defects and validated them in population screening and prenatal diagnosis.Three LAMP colorimetric assays specific for α0-thalassemia (SEA deletion), α0-thalassemia (THAI deletion) and normal DNA sequence were developed. These assays were validated on 341 subjects who had initial thalassemia screening positive and various thalassemia genotypes. Prenatal diagnosis of α0-thalassemia (SEA deletion) was done on 33 fetuses at risk of having Hb Bart's hydrops fetalis syndrome.The LAMP colorimetric assays for α0-thalassemia (SEA and THAI deletions) could be clearly interpreted by naked eyes. The assay for α0-thalassemia (SEA deletion) showed a 100% (62/62 x 100) sensitivity and 98.2% (274/279 x 100) specificity whereas, that of the α0-thalassemia (THAI deletion) showed 100% (1/1 x 100) sensitivity and 99.7% (339/340 x 100) specificity. We obtained a 100% concordant prenatal diagnosis results using LAMP assays of α0-thalassemia (SEA deletion) in 33 fetuses as compared to the conventional PCR analysis.The LAMP colorimetric assays developed are simple, rapid, and do not require sophisticated equipment. Inclusion of the LAMP tests in the existing screening protocol significantly reduce the screening cost and the molecular analysis workload, which should prove useful in the prevention and control program of hemoglobinopathies in the region."
https://openalex.org/W4226253886,"Background Emergency general surgery (EGS) operations are associated with substantial risk of morbidity including postoperative respiratory failure (PRF). While existing risk models are not widely utilized and rely on traditional statistical methods, application of machine learning (ML) in prediction of PRF following EGS remains unexplored. Objective The present study aimed to develop ML-based prediction models for respiratory failure following EGS and compare their performance to traditional regression models using a nationally-representative cohort. Methods Non-elective hospitalizations for EGS (appendectomy, cholecystectomy, repair of perforated ulcer, large or small bowel resection, lysis of adhesions) were identified in the 2016–18 Nationwide Readmissions Database. Factors associated with PRF were identified using ML techniques and logistic regression. The performance of XGBoost and logistic regression was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve and coefficient of determination (R 2 ). The impact of PRF on mortality, length of stay (LOS) and hospitalization costs was secondarily assessed using generalized linear models. Results Of 1,003,703 hospitalizations, 8.8% developed PRF. The XGBoost model exhibited slightly superior discrimination compared to logistic regression (0.900, 95% CI 0.899–0.901 vs 0.894, 95% CI 0.862–0.896). Compared to logistic regression, XGBoost demonstrated excellent calibration across all risk levels (R 2 : 0.998 vs 0.962). Congestive heart failure, neurologic disorders, and coagulopathy were significantly associated with increased risk of PRF. After risk-adjustment, PRF was associated with 10-fold greater odds (95% confidence interval (CI) 9.8–11.1) of mortality and incremental increases in LOS by 3.1 days (95% CI 3.0–3.2) and $11,900 (95% CI 11,600–12,300) in costs. Conclusions Logistic regression and XGBoost perform similarly in overall classification of PRF risk. However, due to superior calibration at extremes of risk, ML-based models may prove more useful in the clinical setting, where probabilities rather than classifications are desired."

Highly infectious biomedical wastes are produced at an unacceptably high rate from health laboratories in developing countries with poor management systems, such as Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was to assess the rate of biomedical waste generation, management practices, and associated factors in public healthcare medical laboratories in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.From July 13 to September 25, 2020, a health institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 6 hospital laboratories and 20 health centres laboratories in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge and practice of biomedical waste management and generation rate were collected d in health facilities using pre tested data collection tools. SPSS version 20 was used to manage the data. To identify independent predictors of the dependent variable, descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, linear, and logistic regression analysis were used. The strength of the association was determined using an odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval.In this study, the mean ± SD daily generation rate of biomedical wastes was 4.9 ± 3.13 kg/day per medical laboratory. Nineteen medical laboratories (74.3%) had proper biomedical waste management practice, which is significantly associated with professionals' knowledge of biomedical waste management policies and guidelines, the availability of separate financial sources for biomedical waste management, and the level of training of professionals.The study found that medical laboratories in Addis Ababa's public healthcare facilities generate a significant amount of biomedical waste. Nearly two-thirds of hospitals performed proper waste segregation, collection, storage, and treatment procedures for biomedical waste generated in their laboratories. However, there was a poor transportation and disposal method. As a result, paying special attention and implementing the current national guidelines for biomedical waste management is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W4226331020,"Background Poisoning commonly occurs among children due to their curiosity, where they tend to explore and investigate their surroundings. They frequently put what they find into their mouths as they do not understand the danger and probably cannot read the warning label. As this issue has not been extensively studied in Malaysia; hence, a retrospective analysis of records was carried out to determine the profile of phone call enquiries regarding poisoning among children at the National Poison Centre (NPC). Methodology The records of all cases of poisoning among children below the age of 18 years were retrospectively reviewed over a period of 10 years from 2006 to 2015. The data on the cases were analysed according to age group and gender, the circumstances and the toxic agent implicated in the poisoning. Results During the 10-year study period, 13,583 calls that met the criteria for this study were referred to the NPC. Of these calls, 62.2% involved children between the age of 0 to 5 years, 9% were children aged between 6 to 12 years, and 28.8% were children between 13 to 18 years. Unintentional poisoning accounted for 96.7% of the incidents involving children between the age of 0 to 5 years, although among the children who were between the age of 13 to 18 years, 76% of the cases were intentional. In all the cases involving children, pharmaceutical agents were the most frequent source of the poisoning. More than 95% of the cases were exposed to poisoning through the oral route. Conclusion Poisoning in children between the age of 0 to 5 years was mainly unintentional, while poisoning in children between the age of 13 to 18 years was mainly intentional, where pharmaceutical and household agents were responsible for more than two-thirds of the poisoning cases. Most of these incidents could have been prevented if protective measures, such as child-resistant enclosures, had been implemented and if the parents and guardians had been educated about preventive measures, such as keeping poisoning agents out of the reach of children."
https://openalex.org/W4225745265,"Pelargonium is a versatile genus mainly from the Cape Region, South Africa. The genus is divided into four subgenera and 16 sections characterized by several groups of chromosomes sizes and numbers. The DNA content of species from all subgenera and sections of Pelargonium, except for the sections Subsucculentia and Campylia was estimated using flow cytometry. Nuclei of Pelargonium samples (leaf or petal tissue) and an internal plant standard (leaf tissue) were isolated together and stained with propidium iodide. The DNA content was estimated providing that the 2C peaks of sample and standard be in linearity in the flow cytometer histograms. In total, 96 Pelargonium accessions of 60 species (22 Pelargonium species for the first time) were analyzed. The 2C DNA content ranged from 0.84 pg (P. longifolium, section Hoarea) to 6.69 pg (P. schizopetalum, section Magnistipulacea) and the corresponding 1Cx DNA content from 0.42 pg (P. longifolium) to 1.72 pg (P. transvaalense. This demonstrates the high plasticity within the genus Pelargonium. Some species, such as P. peltatum accessions revealed a pronounced endopolyploidization in leaves but not in petals underlining the importance to choose the right tissue as sample for the flow cytometry analysis. The reported genome sizes are a step forward towards the characterization of the Pelargonium collection within the German Gene Bank for Ornamental Plants and a valuable base for future sequencing programs of the Pelargonium genomes."

While CS is a lifesaving procedure there is evidence that, beyond a certain threshold, CS rates may contribute to increased maternal and perinatal morbidity. This study aimed to elicit the views of pregnant women’s and clinicians’ on how CS rates might be reduced. Methods Pregnant women and their partners, and clinicians working with pregnant women in a maternity hospital in the Republic of Ireland of Ireland, were invited to participate in focus groups. Eligibility criteria included all women attending antenatal classes and clinicians working with pregnant women. A convenience sample was used and interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results Four focus group interviews were conducted with 30 clinicians and 15 pregnant women and two partners participated in three focus groups. A further two women were interviewed individually. Participants expressed a view that rising CS rates were impacted by a societal perception that CS had become a ‘normal mode of birth’. Suggestions for reducing CS rates were offered by clinicians and pregnant women and their partners. Conclusions Clinicians and pregnant women consider that CS rates can be reduced if a shared philosophy supporting normal birth is prioritised alongside adequate resourcing. Women and their partners also believe that enhanced communication with clinicians is central to reducing CS rates."
https://openalex.org/W4226151466,"Marine plastic pollution is a critical environmental challenge facing policymakers globally. To reduce marine plastic pollution by engaging the people, this study estimated the determinants of waste disposal approach by households, their willingness to participate in road gutters/drainage channels cleanup program and the number of man-days they are willing to contribute. The study used a total of 600 households drawn from 30 enumeration areas. A semi-structured questionnaire was employed in data collection. Means, percentages, multinomial logit model and Heckman selection model were employed in data analysis. The study found that most (67.42 percent) of the households in the coastal city of Lagos engage in illegal waste disposal. Some variables, household size, involvement in previous community cleanup activities, receipt of waste management information, payment of waste management fee, and having a dumpster in a locality, significantly reduce the likelihood of illegal waste disposal. The study also found that most (75.50 percent) of the households were willing to clean up road gutters/drainage channels; however, most (83.20 percent) were only willing to contribute one man-day (eight hours) in a week. Gender and previous participation in voluntary service significantly influenced both households' willingness to participate and the number of the man-days they are willing to contribute. Women are more likely to participate and contribute man-days to the activity. Education, household size and amount paid as waste management fee significantly reduced the number of man-days households are willing to contribute. In contrast, the provision of information on waste management significantly increased the number of days they are likely to participate. The study recommended providing waste management information and dumpsters to reduce illegal waste disposal, mobilizing citizens, especially women, the less educated and low waste fee-paying households, through well-packaged information about plastic pollution."
https://openalex.org/W4226168027,"Research suggests that attendance by physical therapists at continuing education (CE) targeting the management of low back pain (LBP) and neck pain does not result in positive impacts on clinical outcomes. The aim of this study was to determine if therapists attending a self-paced 3-hour online Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) program was associated with any observed changes to patient outcomes and also clinical practice.Participants were 25 different physical therapists who treated 3,705 patients with low back pain (LBP) or neck pain before and after they had completed an online PNE CE course. Change in outcomes measures of pain and disability at discharge were compared for the patients treated before and after the therapist training. Clinical practice patterns of the therapists, including total treatment visits, duration of care, total units billed, average units billed per visit, percentage of 'active' billing units and percentage of 'active and manual' billing units, were also compared for the patient care episodes before and after the therapist training.There was no significant difference for change in pain scores at discharge for patients treated after therapist CE training compared to those treated before regardless of the condition (LBP or neck pain). However, patients with LBP who were treated after therapist CE training did report greater improvement in their disability scores. Also after CE training, for each episode of care, therapists tended to use less total visits, billed fewer units per visit, and billed a greater percentage of more 'active' and 'active and manual' billing units.Attending an online 3-hour CE course on PNE resulted in improved disability scores for patients with LBP, but not for those with neck pain. Changes in clinical behavior by the therapists included using less visits, billing fewer total units, and shifting to more active and manual therapy interventions. Further prospective studies with control groups should investigate the effect of therapist CE on patient outcomes and clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W4226175748,"During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic lockdown, communication between pregnant women and health professionals may have become complicated due to restrictions on movement and saturated health services. This could have impacts on pregnancy monitoring and women's wellbeing. We aimed to i) describe the unmet need of pregnant women living in France to communicate with health professionals about the pandemic and their pregnancy during the lockdown, ii) assess the socio-demographic, medical and contextual factors associated with this unmet need. The Covimater cross-sectional study, conducted in July 2020, includes data on 500 adult women's experiences of pregnancy during the first lockdown period in France (i.e., from March to May 2020). The women, all residents in metropolitan France, answered a web-based questionnaire about their conversations with health professionals during the lockdown, as well as their social and medical characteristics. A robust variance Poisson regression model was used to estimate crude or adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for their unmet need to communicate with health professionals about the pandemic and their pregnancy. Forty-one percent of participants reported an unmet need to communicate with a health professional during the lockdown, mainly about the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to their baby and the consequences for the latter. Factors associated were: i) being professionally inactive (aPR = 1.58,CI95%[(1.14-2.21]), ii) having an educational level below secondary school diploma (1.38,[1.05,-1.81]), iii) having experienced serious arguments/violence (2.12,[1.28-3.52]), iv) being very worried about the pandemic (1.41,[1.11-1.78]), v) being primiparous (1.36,[1.06-1.74]) and vi) having had pregnancy consultations postponed/cancelled by health professionals during the lockdown (1.35,[1.06-1.73]). These results can be used to develop targeted strategies that ensure pregnant women are able to i) communicate with health professionals about the potential impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on their pregnancy, and ii) access up-to-date and reliable information on the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 for themselves and their child."
https://openalex.org/W4226279426,"In Ghana, the high-risk obstetric referral system is inadequate. Delay is common and patients often arrive to receiving hospitals in compromised states. An effective referral system should include an adequately resourced referral hospital, communication across sectors, accountability, transport, monitoring capability and policy support, which are currently lacking. A pilot program was undertaken to facilitate communication between hospital staffs. Additionally, data was collected to better understand and characterize obstetric referrals in Accra. Thirteen institutions were selected based on referral volume to implement the use of pre-referral treatment guidelines and WhatsApp as a mobile technology communication platform (Platform). Participants included healthcare workers from 8 health centers, 4 district hospitals, the Greater Accra Regional Hospital (GARH), administrators, doctors from other tertiary hospitals in Accra and medical consultants abroad. Facilities were provided smartphones and guidelines on using WhatsApp for advice on patient care or referral. Data were collected on WhatsApp communications among participants (March-August 2017). During this period, 618 cases were posted on the Platform and users increased from 69 to 81. The median response time was 17 min, a receiving hospital was identified 511 (82.7%) times and pre-referral treatment was initiated in 341 (55.2%). Subsequently, data collected on 597 referrals to GARH (September-November 2017) included 319 (53.4%) from Platform and 278 (46.6%) from non-Platform hospitals. Of these, 515 (86.3%) were urgent referrals; the median (interquartile range) referral to arrival time was 293 (111-1887) minutes without variation by facility grouping. Taxis were utilized for transportation in 80.2%; however, referral time shortened when patients arrived by ambulance and with a midwife. Only 23.5% of urgent referrals arrived within two hours. This project demonstrates that WhatsApp can be used as a communication tool for high-risk obstetric referrals and highlights the need to continue to improve urban referral processes due to identified delays which may contribute to poor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4226299770,"A type of rodent called a zokor causes great harm to agriculture and forestry production due to its large and sophisticated diet. As this rodent lives subterrane for most of its life, researchers know little about its dietary habits. Further understanding of its diet is important for developing green and sustainable control strategies for the zokor.Chloroplast trnL gene and internal transcription spacer 1 primers were selected for high-throughput sequencing of stomach contents of captured zokor by DNA metabarcoding.A total of 25 zokors were selected, the food list of 32 families, 80 genera, and 154 species was obtained. At the family level, it was found that zokors mainly fed on Asteraceae, Poaceae, Rosaceae, Pinaceae, Brassicaceae, and Apiaceae. At the genus level, zokors mainly fed on Echinops, Littledalea, Artemisia, Picea, Cirsium, and Elymus. The diet alpha diversity of Eospalax cansus was slightly higher than that of Eospalax cansus (P>0.05). The zokor's diet is highly phconsistent with the resources of its habitat. Most food choices tend to be the same between the two zokors. They fed primarily on Calamagrostis, Cirsium, Echinops, Medicago, Sanguisorba, and Taraxacum. Zokors mainly fed on the roots of perennial herbs, which are important source of energy.High-throughput sequencing-based DNA metabarcoding technology has effectively revealed the diet of zokors and indicated that zokors are food generalists."
https://openalex.org/W4226374987,"Primary aldosteronism (PA) usually accompanies suppressed plasma renin activity (PRA) through a negative feedback mechanism. While some cases of PA with unsuppressed PRA were reported, there have been no studies about the characteristics of PA with unsuppressed PRA; thus, these characteristics were examined herein. Nine patients with unsuppressed PRA and 86 patients with suppressed PRA were examined. All patients underwent segmental adrenal venous sampling (sAVS) and adrenalectomy, and were pathologically confirmed to have cytochrome P450 11B2 (CYP11B2)-positive aldosterone-producing adenoma according to international histopathology consensus criteria. Unsuppressed and suppressed PRA were defined as PRA levels of > 1.0 and ≤ 1.0 ng/mL/hr, respectively, in multiple blood samples obtained in the resting position. The unsuppressed PRA group had higher morning cortisol levels (12.6 [8.5, 13.5] vs. 8.5 [7.1, 11.0] μg/dL, P = 0.03) and higher cortisol levels after a 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) (2.2 [1.6, 2.5] vs. 1.3 [1.0, 1.9] μ g/dL, P = 0.004) than the suppressed PRA group. The unsuppressed PRA group also showed higher aldosterone levels on the non-surgical side during sAVS (P = 0.02 before adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation, P = 0.002 after ACTH stimulation), a higher intensity of CYP17 expression in the resected adrenal gland (P = 0.02), and a lower clinical complete success rate 1 year after surgery (P = 0.04) compared with those in the suppressed PRA group. These findings suggest that PA should not be ruled out by unsuppressed PRA among patients with hypertension, particularly when their cortisol levels remain unsuppressed in the 1 mg DST. Meanwhile, it should be acknowledged that patients with unsuppressed PRA have higher aldosterone levels on the non-surgical side, and a lower likelihood of postoperative complete clinical success is to be expected."

The purpose of this study is to examine the convergent validity of the Autism Spectrum Disorder Mealtime Behavior Questionnaire (ASD-MBQ) with the Asahide's test for social adjustment skills, the Japanese version of the short version of the sensory profile questionnaire, the Japanese version of the Social Communication Questionnaire, and the Parenting Strain Index in Japanese children with ASD. The final sample contained 294 children who were diagnosed as the ASD based on the DSM-5 criteria, the mean age of children was 10 ± 4 years (range: 3-18 years). The ASD-MBQ is a questionnaire that comprised of 42 items that are classified into five subdomains: selective eating, clumsiness/manners, interest in/concentration on eating, oral-motor function, and overeating. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient revealed that the ASD-MBQ showed the moderate to high correlation coefficient with all four external criteria. Our results in this study supported the sufficient convergent validity in the ASD-MBQ. Therefore, the ASD-MBQ could be a useful tool for research and practice in a wide range of children with ASD aged 3 to 18."
https://openalex.org/W4225808224,"COVID-19 household transmissibility remains unclear in Pakistan. To understand the dynamics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus disease epidemiology, this study estimated Secondary Attack Rate (SAR) among household and close contacts of index cases in Pakistan using a statistical transmission model.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using an inclusive contact tracing dataset from the provinces of Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa to estimate SAR. We considered the probability of an infected person transmitting the infection to close contacts regardless of residential addresses. This means that close contacts were identified irrespective of their relationship with the index case. We assessed demographic determinants of COVID-19 infectivity and transmissibility. For this purpose based on evolving evidence, and as CDC recommends fully vaccinated people get tested 5-7 days after close contact with a person with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Therefore we followed the same procedure in the close contacts for secondary infection.During the study period from 15th May 2020 to 15th Jan 2021, a total of 339 (33.9%) index cases were studied from 1000 cases initially notified. Among close contact groups (n = 739), households were identified with an assumed mean incubation period of 8.2+4.3 days and a maximum incubation period of 15 days. SAR estimated here is among the household contacts. 117 secondary cases from 739 household contacts, with SAR 11.1% (95% CI 9.0-13.6). All together (240) SAR achieved was 32.48% (95% CI; 29.12-37.87) for symptomatic and confirmed cases. The potential risk factors for SAR identified here included; old age group (>45 years of age), male (gender), household members >5, and residency in urban areas and for index cases high age group. Overall local reproductive number (R) based on the observed household contact frequencies for index/primary cases was 0.9 (95% CI 0.47-1.21) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 1.3 (95% CI 0.73-1.56) in Punjab.SAR estimated here was high especially in the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan. The results highlight the need to adopt rigorous preventive measures to cut the chain of viral transmission and prevent another wave of COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4226054204,"To monitor the safety status of the bolts in coal mining roadways in real time, the safety and stability of the bolt support structure were evaluated. Based on the conventional support bolts used in the field, a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor and medium materials were selected. Through theoretical analysis, the bolt tension, and FBG temperature tests, the strain transmission mechanism of the FBG bolt was analyzed, and it was ensured that the developed FBG bolt could accurately measure the strain of the bolt. In the field test, FBG bolts were arranged on the positive and negative sides of the mining roadway to accurately monitor the safety status of the bolts in service in real time, and the force characteristics of the bolts monitored by the FBG sensor were analyzed to obtain the maximum axial force of the positive and negative bolts. Thereafter, the safety status of the roadway bolt was evaluated. The results show that the positive side bolts axial force change is significantly greater than that of the negative side bolt; with the working face advancing to a distance of 60 m from the bolt as the dividing line, the positive side bolts axial force grows slowly before this, after which the axial force increases rapidly. The locations of the roadway where the positive and negative bolts are most affected by mining are determined, and roadway support and prevention measures for this location should be conducted in time. The safety status of the bolts is evaluated and monitored as follows: the positive side No. 2, No. 3, No. 5, and No. 6 bolts have reached the failure state, the positive side No. 4 bolt is in a dangerous state, the positive side No. 1, negative side No. 8 and No. 9 are in an abnormal state, and the negative side No. 7, No. 10, No. 11, and No. 12 are in a normal condition. This research has laid a technical foundation for the real-time monitoring of the bolt support of the mining roadway and the assessment of the safety status of bolts."
https://openalex.org/W4226139689,"This study examined the effectiveness of lectures and inquiry-based instruction in supporting learning for language minority (LM) students in science gateway courses at a large public research university. Utilizing institutional data from 6,911 students across nine years, we fitted cross–lagged panel designs to model associations between lecture courses and inquiry-based laboratory courses for both LM and non-LM students in two-course sequences of introductory college Physics and Chemistry. We found that initial performance in lectures and laboratory sessions can be a predictor of subsequent course performance across disciplines and independent of LM status. Notably, while LM students performed worse in the initial lecture course, LM status resulted in neither worse performance in inquiry-based laboratory courses nor in worse performance in subsequent courses in the science gateway course sequence. Thus, this study suggests that interventions intended to support LM students in college science should target the initial courses in the corresponding science gateway course sequences."
https://openalex.org/W4226144230,"The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) controls molting in arthropods. The timing of 20E production, and subsequent developmental transitions, is influenced by a variety of environmental factors including nutrition, photoperiod, and temperature, which is particularly relevant in the face of climate change. Environmental changes, combined with rapid urbanization, and the increasing prevalence of urban heat islands (UHI) have contributed to an overall decrease in biodiversity making it critical to understand how organisms respond to elevating global temperatures. Some arthropods, such as the Western black widow spider, Latrodectus hesperus, appear to thrive under UHI conditions, but the physiological mechanism underlying their success has not been explored. Here we examine the relationship between hemolymph 20E titers and spiderling development under non-urban desert (27°C), intermediate (30°C), and urban (33°C) temperatures. We found that a presumptive molt-inducing 20E peak observed in spiders at non-urban desert temperatures was reduced and delayed at higher temperatures. Intermolt 20E titers were also significantly altered in spiders reared under UHI temperatures. Despite the apparent success of black widows in urban environments, we noted that, coincident with the effects on 20E, there were numerous negative effects of elevated temperatures on spiderling development. The differential effects of temperature on pre-molt and intermolt 20E titers suggest distinct hormonal mechanisms underlying the physiological, developmental, and behavioral response to heat, allowing spiders to better cope with urban environments."
https://openalex.org/W4226247821,"While a substantial amount of research has focused on the abuse of opioids and cannabinoids in human populations, few studies have investigated accidental poisoning events in pet populations. The objective of this study was to identify whether poisoning events involving opioids and cannabinoids clustered in space, time, and space-time, and compare the locations of clusters between the two toxicants. Data were obtained concerning reports of dog poisoning events from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals' (ASPCA) Animal Poisoning Control Center (APCC), from 2005-2014. The spatial scan statistic was used to identify clusters with a high proportion of these poisoning events. Our analyses show that opioid and cannabinoid poisoning events clustered in space, time, and space-time. The cluster patterns identified for each toxicant were distinct, but both shared some similarities with human use data. This study may help increase awareness to the public, public health, and veterinary communities about where and when dogs were most affected by opioid and cannabinoid poisonings. This study highlights the need to educate dog owners about safeguarding opioid and cannabinoid products from vulnerable populations."
https://openalex.org/W4224994305,"We present an upper bound of cumulative return in financial trading time series to formulate the most possible profit of many trades. The bound can be used to formally analyze the cumulative return varied by the number of trades, the mean return, and transaction cost rate. We also prove and show the validation of the upper bound, and verify the trend of cumulative return is consistent with that of the proposed bound via simulation experiments. Introducing a set of stochastic assessment methodology based on bootstrap into the organization of experimental data, we illustrate the influence on cumulative return from the relationship between the mean of return and transaction cost rate, technical trading rules, and stock indexes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to present and prove a bound of cumulative return of a stock trading series in theory. Both theoretical analyses and simulation experiments show the presented bound is a good mathematical tool to evaluate the trading risks and chances using given trading rules in stock trading markets."
https://openalex.org/W4224998787,"Executive functioning in preschool children is important for building social relationships during the early stages of development. We investigated the brain dynamics of preschool children during an attention-shifting task involving congruent and incongruent gaze directions in emotional facial expressions (neutral, angry, and happy faces). Ignoring distracting stimuli (gaze direction and expression), participants (17 preschool children and 17 young adults) were required to detect and memorize the location (left or right) of a target symbol as a simple working memory task (i.e., no general priming paradigm in which a target appears after a cue stimulus). For the preschool children, the frontal late positive response and the central and parietal P3 responses increased for angry faces. In addition, a parietal midline α (Pmα) power to change attention levels decreased mainly during the encoding of a target for angry faces, possibly causing an association of no congruency effect on reaction times (i.e., no faster response in the congruent than incongruent gaze condition). For the adults, parietal P3 response and frontal midline θ (Fmθ) power increased mainly during the encoding period for incongruent gaze shifts in happy faces. The Pmα power for happy faces decreased for incongruent gaze during the encoding period and increased for congruent gaze during the first retention period. These results suggest that adults can quickly shift attention to a target in happy faces, sufficiently allocating attentional resources to ignore incongruent gazes and detect a target, which can attenuate a congruency effect on reaction times. By contrast, possibly because of underdeveloped brain activity, preschool children did not show the happy face superiority effect and they may be more responsive to angry faces. These observations imply a crucial key point to build better relationships between developing preschoolers and their parents and educators, incorporating nonverbal communication into social and emotional learning."
https://openalex.org/W4225354225,"Background Although there are effective methods for the treatment and management of various mental illnesses, some individuals still do not seek psychiatric treatment. Various factors could affect this reluctance toward treatment, one of which is the public’s lack of mental health literacy. This survey aimed to measure and compare mental health literacy in Cambodia’s urban and rural areas. Method Tours were held to hold seminars that provided information about mental health in the health centers around Phnom Penh (PP) and Siem Reap (SR), and a survey was conducted on mental health literacy for the participants before the seminar at each location. Anthony Jorm’s vignette of psychosis (young adult) and Angermeyer’s questionnaire were used. After the participants were classified into the “agree group” and “disagree group” for each item, the answers for each item given by the participants in PP and SR were compared using the chi-square test and the odds rate was calculated. Results The participants in SR were more likely to give reasons such as inherited causes, economic problems, stress at work, or family problems as the cause of schizophrenia. The percentage of these beliefs about schizophrenia was relatively lower in PP than in SR. Regarding attitudes toward schizophrenia, the participants in SR were more likely to have negative views and predict negative prognoses than the participants in PP. As for participants’ feelings about schizophrenia, the participants in SR reacted more strongly than those in PP. Even though the participants in SR reacted more negatively, they were sympathetic toward individuals with schizophrenia. Conclusion Overall, the participants in the SR group were more likely to have negative attitudes toward schizophrenia than those in the PP group. These results support our hypothesis that mental health literacy represents the maturity of community mental health in a targeted area."
https://openalex.org/W4225517108,"Thrombocytosis is often an incidental finding in primary care with a range of causes. Despite evidence of a strong association between thrombocytosis and malignancy, guidelines for investigating thrombocytosis in the absence of red flag symptoms remain unclear. A novel automated system of laboratory analysis, intelligent Liver Function Testing (iLFT), launched in Tayside in 2018 and has identified a patient group with thrombocytosis and abnormal liver test (LFT) results. This study analysed the outcome of these patients and investigated the use of thrombocytosis combined with LFTs in predicting risk of cancer.Between August 2018 and August 2020, 6792 patients underwent iLFT, with 246 found to have both thrombocytosis and at least one abnormal LFT. A random case-matched control group of 492 iLFT patients with normal platelet count and at least one abnormal LFT was created. 7.7% (95% CI 4.7-11.8%) of patients with thrombocytosis had cancer compared to 2.0% (1.0-3.7%) of controls. Patients <40 years or with pre-existing causes of thrombocytosis were then excluded. Subsequent analysis revealed a 10.8% (6.6-16.3%) incidence of cancer in thrombocytosis patients (n = 176) compared to 2.5% (1.2-4.6%, p = 0.00014) in patients with normal platelet count (PLT) (n = 398). When thrombocytosis is combined with elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP), there is a positive predictive value (PPV) of 20% for cancer. These rules were subsequently applied to a validation cohort of 71,652 patients, of whom 458 had thrombocytosis and elevated ALP. There was a 30.6% cancer incidence, confirming the strong predictive value of the combined test of PLT and ALP.These findings suggest a substantial increased risk of cancer in patients with thrombocytosis and raised ALP. This could be developed as an adjunct to current investigation algorithms, highlighting high-risk patients and prompting further investigation (such as computed tomography scans) where indicated."

This study aimed to identify the significant factors that predict the perceived burden of medication and health-related quality of life. Methods Adults, aged 18 years and above who have used at least two regular medicines, were invited to complete the study questionnaires between June and October 2019. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to identify significant predictors for perceived burden of medication and health-related quality of life. Results A total of 119 participants completed this study. The average age of the participants was 63 years (SD±16 years). Factors significantly predicting perceived burden of medication were participants’ current health condition (p = 0.001), overall burden of treatment (p&lt;0.001) and being hypertensive (p = 0.037). Similarly, participants’ current health condition (p&lt;0.001) and overall burden of treatment (p = 0.086) were significant predictors for perceived health-related quality of life. Conclusions This study revealed that hypertensive participants in poor health tended to experience higher perceived burden of medication, which in turn was found to be correlated with lower perceived health-related quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W4225604634,"Temporomandibular Disorder (TMD) is a generic term applied to describe musculoskeletal disorders that affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), the masticatory muscles and the related structures. TMD comprises two groups of disorders, namely intra-articular TMD and masticatory muscle disorders. There is still difficulty in establishing the effectiveness of different therapeutic modalities for TMD with robust evidence, despite the large volume of publications in the area. The lack of outcomes standardization may represent a limiting factor in the search for scientific evidence.This study aims to develop a core outcome sets (COS) for clinical trials in intra-articular TMD and masticatory muscle disorders.The protocol for determining the COS-TMD will consist of three phases: 1. Synthesis of TMD Management Intervention Outcomes. The identification of outcomes will be carried out through a systematic review, which will include randomized clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of interventions used in TMD management. 2. Through a two-round international Delphi survey, the list of outcomes will be scored by three panels of stakeholders. 3. A representative sample of key stakeholders will be invited to participate in a face-to-face meeting where they can discuss the results of the Delphi survey and determine the final core set.The implementation of this protocol will determine the COS-TMD, which will be made available for use in all TMD clinical studies. The use of COS when planning and reporting TMD clinical trials will reduce the risk of publication bias and enable proper comparison of results found by different studies."
https://openalex.org/W4225641095,"Bycatch of birds in longline fisheries is a global conservation issue, with between 160,000-320,000 seabirds killed each year, primarily through being caught and drowned as they attempt to snatch baits off hooks as they are set. This conservation issue has received significant recognition in southern hemisphere longline fisheries over the past several decades, largely due to the impact on highly charismatic and highly threatened birds, notably Albatrosses. As a result, the use of effective mitigation measures has been subject to fisheries regulations to reduce seabird bycatch from longliners in a number of national jurisdictions and in several Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RMFOs). While mitigation measures have been mandated in a number of north Pacific longline fisheries, this is largely not the case in north Atlantic longline fisheries. This includes vessels using floated-demersal longlines in the North-East Atlantic longline fishery targeting European Hake Merluccius merluccius, in which high levels of seabird bycatch are estimated. In this paper, we analysed the sinking speed of a floated-demersal longline used to target European Hake in the offshore waters of Scotland, to determine potential bycatch risks to seabirds. We deployed Time Depth Recorder devices at different points of the gear. We assessed how this gear performed in comparison to the best practice minimum sink rate of 0.3 m/s recommended by the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels (ACAP) to limit bird access to baited hooks. We found that the average sinking speed of the floated-demersal longline was substantially slower than the ACAP recommendation, between two and nine times slower in non-weighted parts of the gear down to 10m water depth. Our work also found that the sink rate is particularly slow in the top 2m of the water column, increasing with depth and stabilizing at depths over 10m, presumably a consequence of propeller wash behind the vessel. We calculated that the distance astern of the vessel for hooks to sink beyond susceptible seabirds' reach largely exceeds optimum coverage of best practice design Bird Scaring Lines (100 m). Our results indicate that hooks from floated-demersal longlines are therefore readily open to seabird attacks, and as a result, present a clear bycatch risk. Research is needed to adapt existing mitigation measures to floated-longlines and to develop novel mitigation approaches to improve the sink rate of the gear without impacting target fish catch."
https://openalex.org/W4225724520,"Introduction Drug errors pose a major health hazard to a number of patient populations. However, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus seem especially vulnerable to this risk as diabetes mellitus is usually concomitant with various comorbidities and polypharmacy, which present significant risk factors for the occurrence of drug errors. Despite this fact, there is little data on drug errors from patients’ perspective. The present survey aimed to examine the viewpoints of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus regarding their experiences with medication errors, the overall treatment satisfaction, and their perceptions on how a medication error was handled in daily hospital routine. Materials and methods Inpatients at the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology of the University Hospital of Graz were included in the survey. Out of 100 patients, one-half had insulin therapy before hospitalization while the other half had no insulin therapy prior to admission. After giving informed consent, patients filled out a questionnaire with 22 items. Results Independent of their preexisting therapy, 25% of patients already suffered at least one drug error, whereby prescribing a wrong dose seemed to be the most common type of error. Furthermore, 26% of patients in the non-insulin versus 50% in the insulin group ( p = 0 . 084 ) were convinced that drug errors were addressed honestly by the medical staff, while 54% in the non-insulin versus 80% in the insulin-group ( p = 0 . 061 ) assumed that adequate measures were taken to prevent drug errors. Finally, 9 out of 10 patients seemed satisfied with their treatment regardless of their diabetes therapy. Discussion/conclusion The results of the survey clearly showed that patients experienced at least one medication error during hospitalization. However, these errors only rarely led to patient harm. The survey also revealed the value of an honest and respectful doctor-patient relationship regarding patient perception of medication errors and general complaints. Increasing patient awareness on the existing in-hospital error management systems could eliminate treatment-related concerns and create a climate of trust that is essential for effective treatment."
https://openalex.org/W4225727317,"Most of the existing graph embedding methods are used to describe the single view network and solve the single relation in the network. However, the real world is made up of networks with multiple views of complex relationships, and the existing methods can no longer meet the needs of people. To solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-view attention network inspired by coupled P system(MVAN-CP) to deal with node classification. More specifically, we design a multi-view attention network to extract abundant information from multiple views in the network and obtain a learning representation for each view. To enable the views to collaborate, we further apply attention mechanism to facilitate the view fusion process. Taking advantage of the maximum parallelism of P system, the process of learning and fusion will be realized in the coupled P system, which greatly improves the computational efficiency. Experiments on real network data sets indicate that our model is effective."
https://openalex.org/W4226198744,"In this study, we evaluated whether it is possible to perform forensic radiological skeletal age estimation via radiological examination of the ilioischial, ischiopubic, and iliopubic synchondrosis regions of the pelvis.This study was conducted by retrospectively examining the abdominopelvic images of individuals aged 8-16 who had applied to the hospital for any reason without having a chronic disorder and who had undergone computed tomography. Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed the images. The BT images of the pelvis ilioischial, ischiopubic, and iliopubic synchondrosis regions were evaluated as follows: 0: open, 1: semiclosed, and 2: closed. The data were evaluated using the SPSS 17 program.Two hundred sixty-three children (118 girls and 145 boys) between the ages of 8 and 16 years without any health problems participated. There was a significant difference between the groups for all the evaluated synchondrosis joints in girls and boys (p<0.001 for each group comparison). We observed that ilioischial, ischiopubic, and iliopubic synchondrosis closed earlier in girls than boys. In addition, we found that the joints were closed at the age of 15 and over in boys and at 14 and over in girls.Some studies have previously evaluated synchondrosis by using computed tomography. We showed that forensic radiological skeletal age estimation could be performed by examining ischiopubic-ilioischial-iliopubic synchondrosis in pelvis computed tomography images. The pelvis is more resistant to decay than other parts of the body. Furthermore, pelvis bones can withst and the effects of postmortem animal attacks for a longer period. Therefore, we believe that forensic age estimation can be made on corpses with no extremity, a damaged chest, or whose only pelvic bones are assessable through the method we use.In our study, the ischiopubic-ilioischial-iliopubic joints were open in those aged nine and under and closed in those aged 15 and above. Ilioischial, ischiopubic, and iliopubic synchondrosis were observed to close earlier in girls than in boys. We consider that our study will be beneficial in the 8-16-year-old age group if used. In addition, our study can be used to determine the radiological bone age in cases with wrist bone abnormalities or wrist amputation."
https://openalex.org/W4226242899,"MafB (a bZIP transcription factor), ß-catenin (the ultimate target of the Wnt signal transduction pathway that acts as a transcriptional co-activator of LEF/TCF proteins), and WDR77 (a transcriptional co-activator of multiple hormone receptors) are important for breast cellular transformation. Unexpectedly, these proteins interact directly with each other, and they have similar genomic binding profiles. Furthermore, while some of these common target sites coincide with those bound by LEF/TCF, the majority are located just downstream of transcription initiation sites at a position near paused RNA polymerase (Pol II) and the +1 nucleosome. Occupancy levels of these factors at these promoter-proximal sites are strongly correlated with the level of paused Pol II and transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W4226268307,"The relationship between haze pollution and insurance development is investigated based on the concentration of PM2.5 of 268 Chinese cities during 2009~2018. Subsequently, the effect of haze pollution on the development of insurance and the underlying mechanisms are also explored. The regional governance of haze pollution and its impact on insurance development is estimated by using a unified framework of two-stage least squares. The machine learning method-elastic network is adopted to filter the control variables and avoid multi-collinearity. The results show that haze pollution has an adverse effect on the insurance development through two important underlying mechanisms, residents' emotions and economic development. Haze pollution affects residents' emotions, and the impact coefficient is approximately equal to -0.18, which further inhibits residents' participation in insurance. Moreover, pollution restricts residents' budgets by hindering economic development, the impact coefficient is about -0.07, thus, the development of insurance is suppressed. These two negative effects exhibit regional variations, which gradually attenuate from eastern, western to the Chinese central region. The regional governance has a positive effect on haze pollution with the coefficient of -0.07, while impact coefficient of haze pollution on insurance development decreases to -0.02. The policy implication is that government supervision can formulate reasonable environmental and insurance policies based on the heterogeneity of regional development to alleviate haze pollution and promote insurance development."
https://openalex.org/W4226349037,"Using real-time eye-movement measures, we asked how a fantastical discourse context competes with stored representations of real-world events to influence the moment-by-moment interpretation of a story by 7-year-old children and adults. Seven-year-olds were less effective at bypassing stored real-world knowledge during real-time interpretation than adults. Our results suggest that children privilege stored semantic knowledge over situation-specific information presented in a fictional story context. We suggest that 7-year-olds’ canonical semantic and conceptual relations are sufficiently strongly rooted in statistical patterns in language that have consolidated over time that they overwhelm new and unexpected information even when the latter is fantastical and highly salient."
https://openalex.org/W4226377937,"The carcinogen urethane induces pulmonary tumors in mice initiated by an incredibly specific Q61L/R oncogenic mutation in the proto-oncogene Kras. Previous Whole-Exome Sequencing of urethane-induced tumors revealed a bias towards A➙T/G and G➙A substitutions. Subsequent ultra-sensitive Maximum-Depth Sequencing of Kras shortly after urethane exposure suggest a further refinement to CA➙CT/G substitutions. As C182AA➙C182T/GA substitutions in Kras result in Q61L/R mutations, the extreme bias of urethane towards these genomic driver mutations can be ascribed to the specificity of the carcinogen for CA➙CT/G substitutions. However, we previously found that changing rare codons to common in the Kras gene to increase protein expression shifted mutations in urethane-induced tumors away from Kras, or when detected in Kras, to G12D mutations that are usually rarely detected in such tumors. Moreover, the loss of p53 partially reversed this effect, generating tumors with either Q61L/R or G12D oncogenic Kras mutations, or no Kras mutations, presumably due to other genomic driver mutations. Determining the origin of these G12D and other unknown non-canonical genomic driver mutations would provide critical insight into the extreme bias of carcinogens for specific genomic driver mutations. We thus compared the types of Single Nucleotide Variations detected by previously performed Maximum-Depth Sequencing immediately after urethane exposure to the mutation signatures derived from Whole Exome Sequencing of urethane-induced tumors. This identified two types of non-canonical mutations. First, a V637E oncogenic mutation in the proto-oncogene Braf that conforms to the mutation signature of urethane, suggesting that the mutational bias of the carcinogen may account for this non-canonical mutation, similar to that for canonical Q61L/R mutations in Kras. Second, G12D and Q61H mutations in Kras that did not fit this mutation signature, and instead shared similarity with Single Nucleotide Variations detected by Maximum-Depth Sequencing from normal cells, suggesting that perhaps these mutations were pre-existing. We thus posit that when canonical Kras mutations are selected against that the carcinogen may instead promote the expansion of pre-existing genomic driver mutations, although admittedly we cannot rule out other mechanisms. Interrogating the mutation signatures of human lung cancers similarly identified KRAS genomic driver mutations that failed to match the mutation signature of the tumor. Thus, we also speculate that the selection for non-canonical genomic driver mutations during urethane carcinogenesis may reflect the process by which discordance between genomic driver mutations and mutational signatures arises in human cancers."
