https://openalex.org/W2946016273,"Despite the clinical and genetic heterogeneity of autism, bulk gene expression studies show that changes in the neocortex of autism patients converge on common genes and pathways. However, direct assessment of specific cell types in the brain affected by autism has not been feasible until recently. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing of cortical tissue from patients with autism to identify autism-associated transcriptomic changes in specific cell types. We found that synaptic signaling of upper-layer excitatory neurons and the molecular state of microglia are preferentially affected in autism. Moreover, our results show that dysregulation of specific groups of genes in cortico-cortical projection neurons correlates with clinical severity of autism. These findings suggest that molecular changes in upper-layer cortical circuits are linked to behavioral manifestations of autism."

This poses challenges for how proteins can be supplied to remote regions where connections (synapses) are made with other neurons. One solution to the neuron protein-supply problem involves the local synthesis of proteins from messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules located at or near synapses. Hafner et al. used RNA sequencing methods and superresolution microscopy to show that axon terminals contain hundreds of mRNA molecules as well as the machinery needed for protein synthesis. Furthermore, the axon terminals were able to use these components to make proteins that participate in synaptic transmission. Science , this issue p. eaau3644"
https://openalex.org/W2945658350,"Supporting tumor suppression The protein PTEN is a phosphatase and tumor suppressor whose activity is often decreased in human cancers. Thus, reactivating such a protein could potentially be an effective therapy against cancer. Lee et al. identified a ubiquitin E3 ligase (WWP1) as a PTEN-interacting protein that modifies PTEN and inhibits its tumor suppressive activity (see the Perspective by Parsons). Depletion of WWP1 increased dimerization and membrane recruitment of PTEN. A natural compound found to be a pharmacological inhibitor of WWP1 inhibited tumor growth in a mouse model of prostate cancer. Thus, reactivation of the tumor suppressor PTEN may provide a strategy for battling tumors. Science , this issue p. eaau0159 ; see also p. 633"

https://openalex.org/W2945648932,"Recent studies have indicated that tau, a protein involved in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders, has a propensity to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, the mechanism of this process remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that tau LLPS is largely driven by intermolecular electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged N-terminal and positively charged middle/C-terminal regions, whereas hydrophobic interactions play a surprisingly small role. Furthermore, our results reveal that, in contrast to previous suggestions, phosphorylation is not required for tau LLPS. These findings provide a foundation for understanding the mechanism by which phosphorylation and other posttranslational modifications could modulate tau LLPS in the context of specific physiological functions as well as pathological interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2945416595,"Determination of the absolute configuration of organic molecules is essential in drug development and the subsequent approval process. We show that this determination is possible through electron diffraction using nanocrystalline material. Ab initio structure determination by electron diffraction has so far been limited to compounds that maintain their crystallinity after a dose of one electron per square angstrom or more. We present a complete structure analysis of a pharmaceutical cocrystal of sofosbuvir and l-proline, which is about one order of magnitude less stable. Data collection on multiple positions of a crystal and an advanced-intensity extraction procedure enabled us to solve the structure ab initio. We further show that dynamical diffraction effects are strong enough to permit unambiguous determination of the absolute structure of material composed of light scatterers."

The neural substrates and mechanisms that allow this process are not known. Sarafyazd and Jazayeri performed single-cell recordings in the dorsomedial frontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex of monkeys. They observed that the two brain areas, which have been implicated in error monitoring and the control of adaptive behavior, processed signals involved in causal inference. The anterior cingulate acted downstream of the dorsomedial frontal cortex. It used graded evidence derived from errors in low-level processes in a decision hierarchy to select between longer-term behavioral strategies. Science , this issue p. eaav8911"

MU 69 is part of the Kuiper Belt, a collection of small icy bodies orbiting in the outer Solar System. Stern et al. present the initial results from the New Horizons flyby of MU 69 on 1 January 2019. MU 69 consists of two lobes that appear to have merged at low speed, producing a contact binary. This type of Kuiper Belt object is mostly undisturbed since the formation of the Solar System and so will preserve clues about that process. Science , this issue p. eaaw9771"
https://openalex.org/W2944923223,"Transport control The membrane protein P-glycoprotein protects cells by using energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to expel chemical substances, including drugs. Inhibiting P-glycoprotein may thus ameliorate drug resistance. Structures of P-glycoprotein in the apo state and bound to substrate and inhibitor give insight into the transport mechanism, but a full picture requires access to substates in the transport cycle. Dastvan et al. used double electron electron resonance spectroscopy to show that substrates enhance transport by stabilizing an asymmetric post–ATP-hydrolysis state. By contrast, inhibitors stabilize a symmetric state that impairs transport. Science , this issue p. 689"

Protein function, however, often requires conformational dynamics. Boyken et al. describe designed proteins that undergo conformational transitions in response to pH. They designed helical oligomers in which histidines are positioned in hydrogen-bond networks at the interfaces, with complimentary hydrophobic packing around the networks. Lowering the pH protonated the histidine, disrupting the oligomers. After endocytosis into low-pH compartments in cells, the designed proteins disrupted endosomal membranes.

https://openalex.org/W2946771864,"Unlike mammals, Xenopus laevis tadpoles have a high regenerative potential. To characterize this regenerative response, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing after tail amputation. By comparing naturally occurring regeneration-competent and -incompetent tadpoles, we identified a previously unrecognized cell type, which we term the regeneration-organizing cell (ROC). ROCs are present in the epidermis during normal tail development and specifically relocalize to the amputation plane of regeneration-competent tadpoles, forming the wound epidermis. Genetic ablation or manual removal of ROCs blocks regeneration, whereas transplantation of ROC-containing grafts induces ectopic outgrowths in early embryos. Transcriptional profiling revealed that ROCs secrete ligands associated with key regenerative pathways, signaling to progenitors to reconstitute lost tissue. These findings reveal the cellular mechanism through which ROCs form the wound epidermis and ensure successful regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2946686438,"Magnetic single atoms and molecules are receiving intensifying research focus because of their potential as the smallest possible memory, spintronic, and qubit elements. Scanning probe microscopes used to study these systems have benefited greatly from new techniques that use molecule-functionalized tips to enhance spatial and spectroscopic resolutions and enable new sensing capabilities. We demonstrate a microscopy technique that uses a magnetic molecule, Ni(cyclopentadienyl)2, adsorbed at the apex of a scanning probe tip, to sense exchange interactions with another molecule adsorbed on a Ag(110) surface in a continuously tunable fashion in all three spatial directions. We further used the probe to image contours of exchange interaction strength, revealing angstrom-scale regions where the quantum states of two magnetic molecules strongly mix. Our results pave the way for new nanoscale imaging capabilities based on magnetic single-molecule sensors."
https://openalex.org/W2945975246,"Chemical synthesis typically relies on reactions that generate complexity through elaboration of simple starting materials. Less common are deconstructive strategies toward complexity-particularly those involving carbon-carbon bond scission. Here, we introduce one such transformation: the hydrodealkenylative cleavage of C(sp3)-C(sp2) bonds, conducted below room temperature, using ozone, an iron salt, and a hydrogen atom donor. These reactions are performed in nonanhydrous solvents and open to the air; reach completion within 30 minutes; and deliver their products in high yields, even on decagram scales. We have used this broadly functionality tolerant transformation to produce desirable synthetic intermediates, many of which are optically active, from abundantly available terpenes and terpenoid-derived precursors. We have also applied it in the formal total syntheses of complex molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2945711796,"Sweet spot for making oligosaccharides Sugars pose a challenge for chemists: how to string together functional group–rich building blocks that can adopt multiple conformations. Two papers in this issue used sugar building blocks constrained by a macrocyclic linker to encourage formation of a specific glycosidic linkage (see the Perspective by Pohl). Ikuta et al. used glucose building blocks containing a linker that changes the sugar conformation to synthesize cyclic oligomers with only three or four units. The linker changes the conformation of the glucose monomers, enabling them to come together despite the strain in the final structure. Komura et al. prepared sialic acid building blocks with a linker that allows for selective formation of the α-anomeric linkage with a range of nucleophiles. They synthesized dimers of sialic acid with many different linkages and a pentamer with four α(2,8) linkages. This method enabled chemical synthesis of components of mammalian glycans involved in brain development, cell adhesion, and immune response. Science , this issue p. 674 , p. 677 ; see also p. 631"
https://openalex.org/W2903877348,"The subnanoscale size of typical diatomic molecules hinders direct optical access to their constituents. Rydberg macrodimers-bound states of two highly excited Rydberg atoms-feature interatomic distances easily exceeding optical wavelengths. We report the direct microscopic observation and detailed characterization of such molecules in a gas of ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical lattice. The bond length of about 0.7 micrometers, comparable to the size of small bacteria, matches the diagonal distance of the lattice. By exciting pairs in the initial two-dimensional atom array, we resolved more than 50 vibrational resonances. Using our spatially resolved detection, we observed the macrodimers by correlated atom loss and demonstrated control of the molecular alignment by the choice of the vibrational state. Our results allow for rigorous testing of Rydberg interaction potentials and highlight the potential of quantum gas microscopy for molecular physics."
https://openalex.org/W2945912171,"The dorsomedial striatum (DMS) is critically involved in motor control and reward processing, but the specific neural circuit mediators are poorly understood. Recent evidence highlights the extensive connectivity of low-threshold spiking interneurons (LTSIs) within local striatal circuitry; however, the in vivo function of LTSIs remains largely unexplored. We employed fiber photometry to assess LTSI calcium activity in a range of DMS-mediated behaviors, uncovering specific reward-related activity that is down-modulated during goal-directed learning. Using two mechanistically distinct manipulations, we demonstrated that this down-modulation of LTSI activity is critical for acquisition of novel contingencies, but not for their modification. In contrast, continued LTSI activation slowed instrumental learning. Similar manipulations of fast-spiking interneurons did not reproduce these effects, implying a specific function of LTSIs. Finally, we revealed a role for the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic functions of LTSIs in learning. Together, our data provide new insights into this striatal interneuron subclass as important gatekeepers of goal-directed learning."
https://openalex.org/W2921979765,"Summary Successful visual navigation requires a sense of the geometry of the local environment. How do our brains extract this information from retinal images? Here we visually presented scenes with all possible combinations of five scene-bounding elements (left, right, and back walls; ceiling; floor) to human subjects during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). The fMRI response patterns in the scene-responsive occipital place area (OPA) reflected scene layout with invariance to changes in surface texture. This result contrasted sharply with the primary visual cortex (V1), which reflected low-level image features of the stimuli, and the parahippocampal place area (PPA), which showed better texture than layout decoding. MEG indicated that the texture-invariant scene layout representation is computed from visual input within ∼100 ms, suggesting a rapid computational mechanism. Taken together, these results suggest that the cortical representation underlying our instant sense of the environmental geometry is located in the OPA."
https://openalex.org/W2939862001,"Tendons are an essential part of the musculoskeletal system, connecting muscle and skeletal elements to enable force generation. The transcription factor scleraxis marks vertebrate tendons from early specification. Scleraxis-null mice are viable and have a range of tendon and bone defects in the trunk and limbs but no described cranial phenotype. We report the expression of zebrafish scleraxis orthologs: scleraxis homolog (scx)-a and scxb in cranial and intramuscular tendons and in other skeletal elements. Single mutants for either scxa or scxb, generated by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9), are viable and fertile as adult fish. Although scxb mutants show no obvious phenotype, scxa mutant embryos have defects in cranial tendon maturation and muscle misalignment. Mutation of both scleraxis genes results in more severe defects in cranial tendon differentiation, muscle and cartilage dysmorphogenesis and paralysis, and lethality by 2–5 wk, which indicates an essential function of scleraxis for craniofacial development. At juvenile and adult stages, ribs in scxa mutants fail to mineralize and/or are small and heavily fractured. Scxa mutants also have smaller muscle volume, abnormal swim movement, and defects in bone growth and composition. Scleraxis function is therefore essential for normal craniofacial form and function and vital for fish development.—Kague, E., Hughes, S. M., Lawrence, E. A., Cross, S., Martin-Silverstone, E., Hammond, C. L., Hinits, Y. Scleraxis genes are required for normal musculoskeletal development and for rib growth and mineralization in zebrafish.

https://openalex.org/W2945723598,"The interaction between high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is important for tumor cell growth. We investigated the tumor biological effects of HMGB1 and RAGE interaction. Previously, we identified an inhibitor of HMGB1/RAGE interaction, papaverine (a non-narcotic opium alkaloid), using a unique drug design system and drug repositioning approach. In the present study, we examined the anticancer effects of papaverine in human glioblastoma (GBM) temozolomide (TMZ; as a first-line anticancer medicine)-sensitive U87MG and TMZ-resistant T98G cells. HMGB1 supplementation in the culture medium promoted tumor cell growth in T98G cells, and this effect was canceled by papaverine. In addition, papaverine in T98G cells suppressed cancer cell migration. As an HMGB1/RAGE inhibitor, papaverine also significantly inhibited cell proliferation in U87MG and T98G cells. The effects of papaverine were evaluated in vivo in a U87MG xenograft mouse model by determining tumor growth delay. The results indicate that papaverine, a smooth muscle relaxant, is a potential anticancer drug that may be useful in GBM chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2945457209,"We examined the impact of statins on Yes-associated Protein (YAP) localization, phosphorylation and transcriptional activity in human and mouse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. Exposure of sparse cultures of PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells to cerivastatin or simvastatin induced a striking re-localization of YAP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and inhibited the expression of the YAP/TEAD-regulated genes Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) and Cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 (CYR61). Statins also prevented YAP nuclear import and expression of CTGF and CYR61 stimulated by the mitogenic combination of insulin and neurotensin in dense culture of these PDAC cells. Cerivastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and fluvastatin also inhibited colony formation by PANC-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the hydrophilic statin pravastatin did not exert any inhibitory effect even at a high concentration (10 μM). Mechanistically, cerivastatin did not alter the phosphorylation of YAP at Ser127 in either PANC-1 or MiaPaCa-2 cells incubated without or with neurotensin and insulin but blunted the assembly of actin stress fiber in these cells. We extended these findings with human PDAC cells using primary KC and KPC cells, (expressing KrasG12D or both KrasG12D and mutant p53, respectively) isolated from KC or KPC mice. Using cultures of these murine cells, we show that lipophilic statins induced striking YAP translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, inhibited the expression of Ctgf, Cyr61 and Birc5 and profoundly inhibited colony formation of these cells. Administration of simvastatin to KC mice subjected to diet-induced obesity prevented early pancreatic acini depletion and PanIN formation. Collectively, our results show that lipophilic statins restrain YAP activity and proliferation in pancreatic cancer cell models in vitro and attenuates early lesions leading to PDAC in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2945352332,"Human beings are the dominant top predator in the marine ecosystem. Throughout most of the global ocean this predation is carried out by industrial fishing vessels, that can now be observed in unprecedented detail via satellite monitoring of Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages. The spatial and temporal distribution of this fishing effort emerges from the coupled interaction of ecological and socio-economic drivers and can therefore yield insights on the dynamics of both the ecosystem and fishers. Here we analyze temporal variability of industrial fishing effort from 2015-2017 as recorded by global AIS coverage, and differentiated by fishing gear type. The strongest seasonal signal is a reduction of total deployed effort during the annual fishing moratorium on the numerically-dominant Chinese fleet, which occurs during boreal summer. An additional societally-controlled reduction of effort occurs during boreal winter holidays. After accounting for these societal controls, the total deployed effort is relatively invariant throughout the year for all gear types except squid jiggers and coastal purse seiners. Despite constant deployment levels, strong seasonal variability occurs in the spatial pattern of fishing effort for gears targeting motile pelagic species, including purse seiners, squid jiggers and longliners. Trawlers and fixed gears target bottom-associated coastal prey and show very little overall seasonality, although they exhibit more seasonal variation at locations that are further from port. Our results suggest that societal controls dominate the total deployment of fishing effort, while the behavior of pelagic fish, including seasonal migration and aggregation, is likely the most prominent driver of the spatial seasonal variations in global fishing effort."
https://openalex.org/W2951157867,"Whether stress affects memory depends on which stress pathway becomes activated and which specific memory system is involved. The activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), leads to a release of catecholamines. The activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, leads to a release of glucocorticoids. In thus study, it was investigated whether SNS and/or HPA axis activation are associated with long-term memory (LTM) and/or working memory (WM) performance in humans. Thirty-three participants underwent the socially evaluated cold-pressor test. Salivary alpha-amylase (sAA) was used as a marker for the activation of the SNS and cortisol as marker for HPA axis activation. Memory was assessed by means of word lists with 15 words each. The primacy effect (i.e., the correctly recalled words from the beginning of the lists) of the serial position curve was considered as indicator for LTM. The recency effect (i.e., the correctly recalled words from the end of the lists) were used as estimator for WM performance. In sAA responders, the recency effect and, therefore, WM performance increased immediately after the stressor. This was not found in sAA non-responders. In cortisol responders, the primacy effect and, thus, LTM performance decreased 20 minutes after the stressor. No change in LTM performance was found in cortisol non-responders. Our study supports the assumptions that 1) SNS activation is associated with WM processes via stimulation of the prefrontal cortex, and 2) HPA axis activation is associated with LTM processes through interactions with the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2946495054,"Background Human intestines contain a heterogeneous collection of cells that include immune, neural and epithelial elements interacting in a highly complex physiology that is challenging to maintain ex vivo. There is an extreme oxygen gradient across the intestinal wall due in part to microbiota in the lumen and close to the gut wall, which complicates the design of tissue culture systems. The current study established the use of an organotypic slice model of human intestinal tissue derived from colonoscopy biopsies to study host-microbial interactions after antibiotic treatment, and the influence of oxygen concentration on gut wall function. Methods Organotypic slices from human colon biopsies collected during routine colonoscopy provided three-dimensional environments that maintained cellular morphology ex vivo. Biopsy slices were used to study impacts of oxygen concentrations and antibiotic treatments on epithelial proliferation rates, and metabolites from tissue culture supernatants. Results Immune function was validated via demonstration of a T lymphocyte response to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Following 24 h of Salmonella exposure there was a significant increase in CD3+ T-lymphocytes in biopsy slices. Metabolite profiling of tissue culture supernatants validated the influence of antibiotic treatment under varied oxygen culture conditions on both host and microbiome-mediated metabolism. Epithelial health was influenced by oxygen and antibiotic. Increased epithelial proliferation was measured in lowered oxygen conditions (1% = 5.9 mmHg) compared to atmospheric conditions standard at 5000 feet above sea level in Colorado (~17% = 100 mmHg). Antibiotic treatment reduced epithelial proliferation only in 5.9 mmHg oxygen cultured slices. Conclusions A human colon organotypic slice model was established for applications ranging from gut epithelial proliferation to enteric pathogen influence on mucosal immune functions ex vivo. The results further support the need to account for oxygen concentration in primary tissue cultures, and that antibiotic use impacts gut-microbe-immune interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2945272841,"Background and purpose Aging leads to alterations in cerebrovascular function, and these are thought to contribute to cognitive decline/dementia. Disturbances to cerebral blood flow regulation have been reported, but the findings are inconsistent and to date no study has comprehensively tested the collective and independent contribution of these parameters in the same age range. Such lines of enquiry are vital since aging is a heterogeneous and complex process, with cerebrovascular parameters being differentially affected depending on the individual. A multicomponent comprehensive measure of cerebrovascular function, which accounts for such diversity, is needed to differentiate between healthy young and old adults. Methods We tested the effect of aging on cerebrovascular function by comparing healthy young adults aged 18–30 and older adults aged 60–75, without cognitive impairments. Cerebrovascular blood flow velocity was assessed using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Parameters included resting middle cerebral artery velocity (MCAv), neurovascular coupling, cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 (hypercapnia and hypocapnia), and the pressure-flow response during a sit-to-stand procedure. Results MANOVA revealed that collectively, the parameters discriminated the groups (p < .001). MCAv and pressure-flow responses were lower in the older group (p < .001). While there were no differences in hypercapnic responses (p = .908) and neurovascular coupling (p = .517), hypocapnic responses were elevated in the old (p = .002). Conclusions Collectively, cerebrovascular parameters can distinguish between healthy young and older adults, with aging leading to reductions in MCAv, and altering cerebrovascular reactivity and pressure-flow responses under hypotensive conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2946716477,"Understanding oxidative stress and HTRA1 locus in abnormal angiogenesis resulting in wet AMD pathology is an important step in developing a novel therapeutic approach. Using subretinal injection of oxLDL into C57BL/6 mice, we observed a lesion resembling the features of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), including macrophage infiltration, increased VEGF expression, and neovascularization. However, incubating ARPE-19 cells with oxLDL-a carrier of oxidized phospholipids-resulted in increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemoattractant proteins that recruited monocytes, but no substantial increase in expression of VEGF. Furthermore, incubation of ARPE-19 with oxLDL induced higher expression of HTRA1, which we showed to synergize with oxLDL in elevating the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemoattractant factors. To investigate the role of macrophage infiltration on these expression changes, we treated cultured J774 macrophages with oxLDL and applied the conditioned medium onto ARPE-19 cells. This treatment was found to greatly enhance the expression of VEGF in ARPE-19, indicating the necessity of macrophage secretory products to induce increased expression of VEGF in retinal pigment epithelium. Gene expression analysis revealed that oxLDL induced the expression of Wnt3A in macrophages, a key activator of canonical Wnt signaling pathways. In addition, western blot analysis showed that the macrophage conditioned media further enhanced the reduction of phosphorylated β-catenin induced by oxLDL. Lastly, we investigated HTRA1 as a potential target for AMD therapeutics. We demonstrated the ability of anti-HTRA1 antibody in vitro to neutralize the protease activity of HTRA1 and reduce the inflammatory and angiogenic response to oxidative stress. Finally, we validated the neutralizing effect of anti-HTRA1 antibody in vivo by evaluating lesion size and protein expression in a laser-photocoagulation murine model of CNV. We found that the combination of oxLDL and HTRA1 enhanced CNV size, which was reversed by the addition of anti-HTRA1 antibody. This study not only provides preliminary evidence that HTRA1 may be a viable target for AMD therapeutics but also elucidates the biochemical mechanisms by which this therapeutic effect may be mediated."
https://openalex.org/W2946820012,"The role of mitochondria in cancer continues to be debated, and whether exploitation of mitochondrial functions is a general hallmark of malignancy or a tumor- or context-specific response is still unknown. Using a variety of cancer cell lines and several technical approaches, including siRNA-mediated gene silencing, ChIP assays, global metabolomics and focused metabolite analyses, bioenergetics, and cell viability assays, we show that two oncogenic Myc proteins, c-Myc and N-Myc, transcriptionally control the expression of the mitochondrial chaperone TNFR-associated protein-1 (TRAP1) in cancer. In turn, this Myc-mediated regulation preserved the folding and function of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complex II and IV subunits, dampened reactive oxygen species production, and enabled oxidative bioenergetics in tumor cells. Of note, we found that genetic or pharmacological targeting of this pathway shuts off tumor cell motility and invasion, kills Myc-expressing cells in a TRAP1-dependent manner, and suppresses primary and metastatic tumor growth in vivo. We conclude that exploitation of mitochondrial functions is a general trait of tumorigenesis and that this reliance of cancer cells on mitochondrial OXPHOS pathways could offer an actionable therapeutic target in the clinic.

In this study, we investigate a role of oncogenic Myc in exploiting mitochondria for cancer progression. Oncogenic Myc drives aggressive and metastatic prostate cancer (16.Rodriguez-Bravo V. Pippa R.

Therefore, we began this study by conducting a global metabolomics screening (∼5,000 metabolites, first metabolomic screen) in prostate adenocarcinoma PC3 cells transfected with nontargeted siRNA or Myc-directed siRNA. Loss of Myc in these conditions down-regulated several metabolic clusters (clusters 9 and 4) (Fig. S1A). Bioinformatics analysis of this dataset (Fig. S1B) demonstrated that Myc loss reduced the levels of purine (AMP ↓1.9-fold; ADP ↓1.7-fold; GDP ↓1.9-fold; GTP ↓1.3-fold) and pyrimidine (UDP ↓2.6-fold; UTP ↓1.6-fold) bases, TCA 2The abbreviations used are: TCAtrichloroacetic acidROSreactive oxygen speciesOCRoxygen consumption ratePrx3peroxiredoxin-3SDHBsuccinate dehydrogenase BECARextracellular acidification rateDoxdoxycycline4OHT4-hydroxytamoxifenCoxcytochrome c oxidaseAMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseFAKfocal adhesion kinaseAGCautomated gain controlITinjection time. cycle intermediates (citrate ↓1.7-fold, malate ↓1.4-fold; cis-aconitic acid ↓1.7-fold; succinate ↓1.3-fold), and catabolites (urea ↓1.5-fold; creatinine ↓1.3-fold) (Fig. 1A, Fig. S1B). A second focused metabolomics screen of ∼300 metabolites gave similar results (Fig. S1B), as Myc silencing in PC3 cells reduced the levels of oxidative phosphorylation and TCA cycle biochemicals, along with metabolites involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways and amino acid levels (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1B). Conversely, Myc knockdown did not affect glutamine levels in PC3 cells (13.Stine Z.E. Walton Z.E. Altman B.J. Hsieh A.L. Dang C.V. MYC, metabolism, and cancer.Cancer Discov. 2015; 5 (26382145): 1024-103910.1158/2159-8290.CD-15-0507Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), suggesting tumor-specific differences in metabolic reprogramming. Consistent with these data, Myc-silenced PC3 cells exhibited decreased oxygen consumption rates (OCR) (Fig. S1C) and overall reduced oxygen consumption (Fig. 1B). Together with lower glucose utilization (Fig. S1D), decreased lactate generation (Fig. S1E), and reduced extracellular acidification rates (ECAR) (Fig. S1F), these cells showed diminished ATP production, compared with control transfectants (Fig. 1C). trichloroacetic acid reactive oxygen species oxygen consumption rate peroxiredoxin-3 succinate dehydrogenase B extracellular acidification rate doxycycline 4-hydroxytamoxifen cytochrome c oxidase AMP-activated protein kinase focal adhesion kinase automated gain control injection time. Next, we looked at the mechanism(s) of Myc regulation of oxidative phosphorylation. We found that Myc silencing in PC3 cells caused the accumulation of detergent-insoluble subunits, i.e. misfolded oxidative phosphorylation complex subunits, including succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB, complex II) and cytochrome c oxidase II (CoxII, complex IV) (Fig. 1, D and E). Other oxidative phosphorylation subunits, ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase core protein 2 (UQCRC2, complex III) or ATP synthase F1 subunit (ATP5A, complex V), were unaffected (Fig. S2A). Consistent with these results, Myc knockdown resulted in reduced mitochondrial complex II and complex IV activity, compared with control transfectants (Fig. 1F; Fig. S2B). Instead, complex I activity was unchanged in control or Myc-silenced cells (Fig. S2, C and D). In line with the defects of oxidative bioenergetics, Myc loss was accompanied by increased production of mitochondrial ROS (Fig. S2E), hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxin-3 (Prx3) (Fig. S2F), a marker of oxidative stress, and phosphorylation of the energy sensor, AMPK (Thr-172), indicative of nutrient deprivation (Fig. S2F). Previous studies have shown that SDHB protein folding requires the activity of the mitochondrial Hsp90-like chaperone, TNFR-associated protein-1 (TRAP1) (17.Chae Y.C. Angelin A. Lisanti S. Kossenkov A.V. Speicher K.D. Wang H. Powers J.F. Tischler A.S. Pacak K. Fliedner S. Michalek R.D. Karoly E.D. Wallace D.C. Languino L.R. Speicher D.W. Altieri D.C.

Analysis of ChIP-Seq tracks demonstrated time-dependent accumulation of Myc at the TRAP1 promoter in Burkitt’s lymphoma P493 cells as well as neuroblastoma BE2C, Kelly, and NGP cell lines (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this, Myc bound to the promoter of TRAP1, as well as NPM1, a known Myc target gene, by ChIP in P493 or PC3 cells, in a reaction abolished by siRNA knockdown of Myc (Fig. 2B). As a result, Myc silencing reduced the expression of TRAP1 mRNA (Fig. S3A) and protein (Fig. S3B) in various tumor cell types. Bioinformatics analysis of four independent cancer cell line data bases demonstrated that high levels of Myc strongly correlated (p = 2.6 × 10−20–6.1 × 10−117) with TRAP1 expression (Fig. S3C), reinforcing the generality of this response across genetically disparate tumors. We next asked whether the Myc homolog, N-Myc, also regulated TRAP1 in the model of neuroblastoma (Fig. 2A). Conditional silencing of N-Myc in neuroblastoma SHEP21 cells reduced TRAP1 mRNA (Fig. S4A) and protein expression (Fig. S4B). Conversely, 4OHT-regulated induction of N-Myc in SHEP or SKNAS cells increased TRAP1 mRNA (Fig. S4C) and protein levels (Fig. S4B). Sequence analysis of a human TRAP1 locus revealed the presence of putative c-Myc- and N-Myc–binding sites within ∼1.4 kb of the first ATG (Fig. S4D). Transfection of this TRAP1 promoter region upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (TRAP1-Luc) produced luciferase activity in PC3 or P493 cells, in a response abolished by siRNA knockdown of Myc (Fig. S4E). In addition, mutagenesis of a putative Myc-binding site at position −60 abolished TRAP1-Luc luciferase activity in control and Myc-knockdown PC3 cells (Fig. S4F). Next, we asked whether TRAP1 was required for mitochondrial bioenergetics in Myc-expressing tumors. We found that re-expression of non-siRNA–inhibitable TRAP1 in Myc knockdown cells rescued the defect of OCR (Fig. 2C) and corrected basal respiration in these settings (Fig. 2D). Consistent with improved bioenergetics, reconstitution with TRAP1 restored ATP production in Myc knockdown cells (Fig. 2E) and reversed the expression of markers of cellular starvation (AMPK phosphorylation) and oxidative stress (Prx3 hyperoxidation) (Fig. 2F). As a prerequisite of these responses, re-expression of TRAP1 in Myc knockdown PC3 cells corrected the folding of SDHB (complex II) and CoxII (complex IV) subunits (Fig. 2G; Fig. S5A), restoring complex II (Fig. S5, B and C) and complex IV (Fig. S5, D and E) activity, quantitatively comparable with control transfectants. TRAP1-directed bioenergetics has been implicated in tumor traits (18.Altieri D.C. Hsp90 regulation of mitochondrial protein folding: from organelle integrity to cellular homeostasis.Cell. Mol.

Invest. 2013; 123 (23921130): 2907-292010.1172/JCI67841Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and this possibility was next investigated. We found that Myc silencing with two independent siRNA sequences (Fig. S6A) or pooled siRNA (Fig. 3A) potently inhibited tumor cell motility (Fig. S6A; Fig. 3A). Quantitative analysis of time-lapse video microscopy demonstrated that Myc loss suppressed the speed of cell movements and shortened the total distance traveled by individual cells (Fig. 3B; Fig. S6B). Consistent with these data, Myc knockdown suppressed tumor cell invasion across Matrigel-coated inserts (Fig. 3, C and D; Fig. S6, D and E). In reconstitution experiments, re-expression of TRAP1 in Myc-silenced cells was sufficient to correct the defect in tumor cell motility (Fig. 3A; Fig. S6A), restore the speed of cell movements and the total distance traveled by individual cells (Fig. 3B; Fig. S6B), and increase tumor cell invasion across Matrigel to levels of control transfectants (Fig. 3, C and D; Fig. S6, C and D). Biochemically, PC3 cells reconstituted with TRAP1 also exhibited phosphorylation of cell motility kinases, Src and focal adhesion kinase (FAK), which was suppressed by Myc knockdown (Fig. 3E). Analysis of neuroblastoma patient cohorts revealed that TRAP1 expression was strongly associated with N-Myc levels (p = 1 × 10−63–2 × 10−96) (Fig. S7A) and correlated with shortened overall survival (Fig. S7B), reinforcing the clinical relevance of this pathway. To test whether this could provide an actionable therapeutic target, we next treated P493 or neuroblastoma NLF or IMR cells with a mitochondria-targeted small molecule TRAP1 antagonist, Gamitrinib (18.Altieri D.C. Hsp90 regulation of mitochondrial protein folding: from organelle integrity to cellular homeostasis.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2013; 70 (23052217): 2463-247210.1007/s00018-012-1177-0Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In these experiments, Gamitrinib treatment caused concentration-dependent dissipation of mitochondrial inner membrane potential (Fig. S7C) and complete loss of tumor cell viability (Fig. 4A). This response was specific because siRNA silencing of TRAP1 attenuated Gamitrinib-mediated cell killing, whereas reconstitution with TRAP1 strongly increased cell death in these settings (Fig. 4B). Consistent with these data, Gamitrinib suppressed neuroblastoma NLF or IMR colony formation (Fig. 4, C and D) and inhibited P493 xenograft tumor growth in immunocompromised mice (Fig. 4, E and F). When analyzed in a model of disseminated disease, systemic administration of Gamitrinib suppressed liver metastases of PC3 cells (Fig. 4G), reducing both the surface area and number of metastatic foci (Fig. 4H), compared with vehicle-treated animals. In sum, the identification of TRAP1 as a direct transcriptional target of a ubiquitous oncogene, i.e. Myc (11.Walz S. Lorenzin F. Morton J. Wiese K.E. von Eyss B. Herold S. Rycak L. Dumay-Odelot H.

This is consistent with an expanding role of mitochondria as tumor drivers (4.Vyas S. Zaganjor E. Haigis M.C.

The regulation by Myc explains why TRAP1 is prominently overexpressed in genetically disparate malignancies, compared with normal tissues (20.Kang B.H. Plescia J. Dohi T. Rosa J. Doxsey S.J.

Data from genetically engineered mouse models support this conclusion, as transgenic expression of TRAP1 accelerated prostatic tumorigenesis (21.Lisanti S. Garlick D.S. Bryant K.G. Tavecchio M.

On the other hand, the Myc–TRAP1 axis of mitochondrial reprogramming is druggable, and selective disruption of intra-organelle protein folding with Gamitrinib (18.Altieri D.C.

https://openalex.org/W2960326457,"The mitochondrial matrix ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities (m-AAA) protease spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7) has been recently implicated as either a negative or positive regulatory component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by two research groups. To address this controversy, we investigated possible mechanisms that explain the discrepancies between these two studies. We found that loss of the SPG7 gene increased resistance to Ca2+-induced mPTP opening. However, this occurs independently of cyclophilin D (cyclosporine A insensitive) rather it is through decreased mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations and subsequent adaptations mediated by impaired formation of functional mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter complexes. We found that SPG7 directs the m-AAA complex to favor association with the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) and MCU processing regulates higher order MCU-complex formation. The results suggest that SPG7 does not constitute a core component of the mPTP but can modulate mPTP through regulation of the basal mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration. The mitochondrial matrix ATPase associated with diverse cellular activities (m-AAA) protease spastic paraplegia 7 (SPG7) has been recently implicated as either a negative or positive regulatory component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) by two research groups. To address this controversy, we investigated possible mechanisms that explain the discrepancies between these two studies.

Comprehensive examination of models that limit skeletal muscle mitochondrial lipid overload is likely to facilitate identification of novel mechanisms through which alleviating the mitochondrial lipid burden improves whole-body glucose homeostasis. One such model that links improved glucose homeostasis with reduced mitochondrial fatty acid entry is the skeletal muscle-specific, Cpt1b-deficient (Cpt1bM−/−) mouse (8Vandanmagsar B. Warfel J.D.

Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (Cpt1) is localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane and is the rate-limiting enzyme controlling mitochondrial lipid entry. Cpt1 facilitates mitochondrial lipid entry by converting acyl-CoAs to acylcarnitines, which then enter the mitochondrion by passing through the transmembrane-spanning carnitine–acylcarnitine translocase. Once within the mitochondrial matrix, acylcarnitines are converted back into acyl-CoAs, which then enter the β-oxidative pathway for use as metabolic fuel. Given its critical role in this process, it is not surprising that inhibition of Cpt1 activity greatly limits mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (9Wicks S.E. Vandanmagsar B. Haynie K.R. Fuller S.E.

These results support the concept that mitochondrial lipid overload contributes to glucose intolerance, and strategies that limit mitochondrial fat entry in skeletal muscle can limit lipid-induced insulin resistance. As such, Cpt1bM−/− mice provide a valuable experimental model that can be used to investigate adaptations that improve metabolic health when skeletal muscle mitochondrial lipid overload is mitigated. Currently, comprehensive effects of muscle-specific Cpt1b deficiency are unknown; therefore, the purpose of this study is to address this gap by employing an integrative systems biology approach to assess global molecular differences in skeletal muscle from Cpt1bfl/fl versus Cpt1bM−/− mice. Specifically, we analyzed skeletal muscle (mixed gastrocnemius) samples through datasets derived from transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic platforms and interrogated the unique and common responses among the different methodologies. This integrative approach revealed substantial remodeling of substrate metabolism pathways that are consistent with our previous findings and provides insight into potential mechanisms that could contribute to the beneficial phenotypes that result when mitochondrial lipid entry is limited specifically in skeletal muscle.

Proteomics analysis yielded identifications for 3,036 peptides and 591 proteins across all samples. After curation for high-quality peptides, the final quantitative dataset was based on 2,955 peptides and 581 proteins, with 408 proteins containing at least two unique peptides. 62 proteins (∼11% of the identified proteome) were ≥1.5-fold different between genotypes with 60/62 being significantly higher in Cpt1bM−/− mice (Fig. 1B). Nontargeted metabolomics analysis annotated 9,374 m/z features displaying chromatographic peak-like qualities. Currently, 85 of these features have been identified in our library. The remaining 9,289 features likely correspond to other unidentified polar, water-soluble metabolites, but they may also contain isotope and adduct variant metabolites. Using a p < 0.05 threshold, 59% of the identified metabolites were different between genotypes, with 33 increased and 17 decreased in Cpt1bM−/− mice (Fig. 1C). Additionally, 31% of the unidentified metabolite peaks were different as 1,245 metabolites were greater in Cpt1bM−/− mice, whereas 1,637 metabolites were lower compared with Cpt1bfl/fl littermates (Fig. 1D). serial analysis of gene expression AMP-activated protein kinase long-chain fatty acid mixed gastrocnemius 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide principal component analysis gene-set enrichment analysis Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes molecular signatures database ingenuity pathway analysis quality control false discovery rate ultraperformance liquid chromatography signal-to-noise ratio tricarboxylic acid electron transport chain transcription factor A, mitochondrial carnitine acetyltransferase carnitine octanoyltransferase collision energy peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor high definition mass spectrometry. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on SAGE, proteomics, and metabolomics datasets to detect potential outliers and to further investigate how global gene, protein, and metabolite expression could differentiate between experimental groups (Fig. 1, A–D, insets). Whereas a moderate level of group separation was noted for transcriptomic and proteomic data, PCA results from the metabolomics dataset (both known and unknown metabolites) revealed a clear separation. Additionally, 41 of the 50 identified metabolites that were significantly different between Cpt1fl/fl versus Cpt1bM−/− mice were also significantly correlated (p ≤ 0.0251 and FDR <0.1) with glucose homeostasis (Fig. S1C). To further identify metabolites that were key contributors to the top principal components explaining the difference between Cpt1bfl/fl versus Cpt1bM−/− mice, we generated a variable-loading heatmap for the first 10 principal components that explains 95% of the variance within the dataset, and we further annotated it with the log ratio and false discovery rates of the metabolites (Fig. 1E). The heatmap shows the greatest contribution from these metabolites primarily involved the first PC (PC1), with some showing increased expression in Cpt1bM−/− mice (Fig. 1E, purple) and others reduced expression (blue). It is interesting to note that 11 of the 18 metabolites identified in PC1 are nucleic acid constituents, including nucleobases (hypoxanthine (purine analogue) and uracil (pyrimidine analogue)), ribonucleosides (inosine, guanosine, adenosine, and cytidine), ribonucleotides (cytidine monophosphate (CMP), uridine monophosphate (UMP), guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and adenosine monophosphate (AMP)), and a deoxyribonucleotide (deoxyguanosine monophosphate (dGMP)). These nucleic acid constituents are key contributors to the nucleotide pool that are the building blocks for DNA and RNA; therefore, we examined the SAGE dataset for pathways involved in nucleic acid metabolism. As shown in Fig. S2, gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that neither the purine nor the pyrimidine metabolism pathways were significantly enriched, suggesting these pathways may not be the primary impetus driving changes in these metabolites. Alternatively, nucleotides are also critical to the synthesis of key factors involved in energy metabolism pathways, including nucleoside triphosphates (ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP), reducing equivalents (NAD and FAD), and coenzyme A (CoA). As a result, much of the analyses performed using Cpt1bM−/− mice indicates significant remodeling of energy metabolism pathways, and many of these alterations are discussed in greater detail in the context of relevant metabolic pathways below. To gain understanding of the possible effects of transcriptomic changes on biological processes in Cpt1bM−/− mice, we subjected SAGE data to GSEA. Results show up-regulation of several pathways involved in lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, and mitochondrial function (Table S1) in Cpt1bM−/− mice. A parallel investigation using over-representation analysis of “biofunctions” via IPA software identified significant differences in several biofunctions, including activation of lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, carboxylic acid transport, thermoregulation, and regulation of muscle mass and body size (Table S2). Remarkably, these transcriptomic adaptations were equally consistent with models predictive of better metabolic health: for example, predicted reductions in glucose metabolism disorders, hepatic steatosis, fatigue, cardiac hypertrophy, and premature mortality (Table S2). Because GSEA and IPA results revealed that remodeling of many substrate metabolism pathways in Cpt1bM−/− mice likely predicts improved metabolic health, we mapped the global gene expression differences onto a comprehensive KEGG metabolic network map (Fig. S3), highlighting the key areas of cellular metabolism affected between the genotypes. Individual pathways of interest will be discussed in greater detail below. To identify possible transcriptional networks governing the observed gene expression changes, we constructed a regulator/effector network based on curated information available from the IPA Knowledge Base. The network consists of three layers with the top layer being transcription regulators, the middle layer being observed gene expression changes, and the bottom layer being predicted phenotypic effects (Fig. 2A). This network map indicated changes in genes that regulate substrate metabolism, and metabolic disease phenotypes were likely mediated by induction of overlapping transcription factor networks involving peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (Ppar) pathways, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1), retinoic acid receptor–related orphan receptor α (Rora), Krüppel-like factor 15 (Klf15), estrogen-related receptor α (Esrra), and PPARγ coactivator 1-α (Pgc-1α). Analysis of the portion of the network directly linked to Cpt1b (Fig. S4A) revealed induction of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (Fig. 2B), glycerolipid metabolism (Fig. 2C), and peroxisomal metabolism (Fig. 2D), which were some of the most robustly up-regulated pathways noted in the GSEA (Table S1). Peroxisomal adaptations showed particular enrichment of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (Fig. S4B). Additionally, whereas the individual PPAR isoforms did not appear to be regulated, the PPAR signaling network was identified as strongly enhanced via GSEA (Fig. 2E). Mapping the PPAR network indicated that the genes regulated in Cpt1bM−/− mice were primarily involved in lipid transport and oxidation (Fig. S4C). Proteomic analysis further supported this finding through the observed induction of several proteins involved in lipid metabolism in Cpt1bM−/− skeletal muscle (Fig. 2F). Fig. S1B shows Cpt1bM−/− mice have improved glucose homeostasis because they have lower baseline glucose levels and maintain lower blood glucose throughout a glucose tolerance test than the Cpt1bfl/fl controls, which is consistent with previous findings (8Vandanmagsar B.

In this study, globaltest analysis of 118 genes linked to the insulin-signaling cascade indicated significant alterations in this pathway (p = 0.006) within the basal (i.e. not insulin-stimulated) state (Fig. 3A). It is, however, worth noting that roughly half of the differentially regulated genes were increased, while the other half were decreased. We next investigated gene enrichment within glycolysis (Fig. 3B) and pyruvate handling (Fig. 3C) and observed significant up-regulation of genes in both pathways. Mapping changes to a KEGG pathway map suggests remodeling of the glycolytic pathway was modest and most likely driven primarily by adaptations in pyruvate handling (Fig. 3D). This coincides well with the KEGG map for the pyruvate handling pathway (Fig. S4D) and provides mechanistic insight helping to explain our previous observations showing increased pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in Cpt1bM−/− skeletal muscle (8Vandanmagsar B.

Analysis of the identified metabolites indicated that although the pyruvate levels were not different between genotypes, acetyl-CoA levels were nearly 14-fold higher in Cpt1bM−/− skeletal muscle (Fig. 4B). Heightened acetyl-CoA production appears to be at least partially facilitated by a 4.5-fold increase in free CoA (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, enrichment of the CoA biosynthesis pathway was observed in Cpt1bM−/− mice (Fig. 4C), which included a significant increase in expression of the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in CoA biosynthesis, pantothenate kinase 1 (Pank1). This was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. S5A), and CT values (22–24) indicate Pank1 is a fairly abundant transcript in muscle. Additionally, perhaps the most compelling evidence for enhanced CoA biosynthesis is that Cpt1bM−/− mice exhibit 41-fold greater levels of the metabolite precursor for CoA synthesis, dephospho-CoA (Fig. 4B). Differences in CoA and acetyl-CoA could also be impacted by a variety of other factors including but not limited to the following: changes in flux rates; acyl-CoA synthetase activity (Acss1–3, Acsf1–4, Acsm1–5, Acsl1–6, Acsbg1/2, and Fatp1–6); carnitine acyltransferase activity (CrAT, CrOT, Cpt1a, Cpt1b, Cpt1c, and Cpt2); activity of dehydrogenase enzymes with a lipoic acid moiety (pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase); acetyl-CoA acyltransferase activity (Acat1/2 and Acaa1/2); acyl-CoA thioesterase activity (Acot1–13 and Them4/5); acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase activity (Aacs); acetyl-CoA consuming reactions (CS, ACC, and HS2, etc.); as well as activity of various acetyltransferase and acyltransferase enzymes that regulate post-translational modification. Differential expression of several genes involved in these pathways was observed in the SAGE dataset, so we attempted to validate these with RT-PCR. We previously reported CrAT, CrOT, Cpt2, CS, Pdha1, Sdhb, Bckdh, and Fatp1 are significantly higher in Cpt1bM−/− skeletal muscle (8Vandanmagsar B. Warfel J.D. Wicks S.E. Ghosh S. Salbaum J.M. Burk D.

A previous analysis of its genome uncovered evidence that C. bescii may have a completely uncharacterized aspect to its redox metabolism, involving a tungsten-containing oxidoreductase of unknown function. Herein, we purified and characterized this new member of the aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase family of tungstoenzymes. We show that it is a heterodimeric glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP) ferredoxin oxidoreductase (GOR) present not only in all known Caldicellulosiruptor species, but also in 44 mostly anaerobic bacterial genera. GOR is phylogenetically distinct from the monomeric GAP-oxidizing enzyme found previously in several Archaea. We found that its large subunit (GOR-L) contains a single tungstopterin site and one iron-sulfur [4Fe-4S] cluster, that the small subunit (GOR-S) contains four [4Fe-4S] clusters, and that GOR uses ferredoxin as an electron acceptor. Deletion of either subunit resulted in a distinct growth phenotype on both C5 and C6 sugars, with an increased lag phase, but higher cell densities. Using metabolomics and kinetic analyses, we show that GOR functions in parallel with the conventional GAP dehydrogenase, providing an alternative ferredoxin-dependent glycolytic pathway. These two pathways likely facilitate the recycling of reduced redox carriers (NADH and ferredoxin) in response to environmental H2 concentrations. This metabolic flexibility has important implications for the future engineering of this and related species.

These diseases are caused by expansions of CAG triplet repeats coding for abnormally long polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches (11Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Glutamine repeats and neurodegeneration.Annu. Rev.

The size of these expansions are inversely correlated with the onset age of these diseases and to the aggregation propensity of the respective proteins (10Kuiper E.F. de Mattos E.P. Jardim L.B.

Unlike heat-induced aggregates that are generally driven by hydrophobic interactions (12Kim Y.E. Hipp M.S. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Hartl F.U. Molecular chaperone functions in protein folding and proteostasis.Annu. Rev.

However, why HSPB7 stands out as the most potent suppressor of polyQ aggregation within the HSPB family has remained an enigma. Previously, we showed that HSPB7 requires (macro) autophagy for its suppressive action on polyQ aggregation (8Vos M.J. Zijlstra M.P. Kanon B. van Waarde-Verhagen M.A. Brunt E.R. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Carra S. Sibon O.C. Kampinga H.H. HSPB7 is the most potent polyQ aggregation suppressor within the HSPB family of molecular chaperones.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19 (20843828): 4677-469310.1093/hmg/ddq398Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, HSPB7 differs from other autophagy-related suppressors like Alfy, as it cannot act on preformed aggregates to fulfill its function (15Eenjes E. Dragich J.M. Kampinga H.H. Yamamoto A. Distinguishing aggregate formation and aggregate clearance using cell-based assays.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 (26818841): 1260-127010.1242/jcs.179978Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). One model that explains this finding predicts that HSPB7 is present during aggregate formation and binds these protofibrils to maintain early aggregates in a state competent for processing by the autophagic machinery (16Vos M.J. Zijlstra M.P. Carra S. Sibon O.C. Kampinga H.H. Small heat shock proteins, protein degradation and protein aggregation diseases.Autophagy. 2011; 7 (21045566): 101-10310.4161/auto.7.1.13935Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this article, we investigated which characteristics of HSPB7 are required to chaperone polyQ proteins and prevent their aggregation. HSPB7 acts directly on the aggregation process as recombinant HSPB7 can delay in vitro polyQ aggregation, whereas HSPB1 cannot. HSPB7 acts mainly on regions flanking the polyQ and not on the amyloid core itself. In cells, this remarkable suppression depends on the N terminus of HSPB7 that is predicted as an intrinsically disordered region. Although the N terminus by itself is not capable of suppressing aggregation, fusion to the α-crystallin domain of HSPB1 results in a hybrid protein with polyQ anti-aggregation properties. In summary, the full and unique N-terminal domain is key to the specific ability of HSPB7 to inhibit polyQ aggregation. Within the HSPB family, cell-based analyses had revealed that HSPB7 stands out as a chaperone that is the most capable to prevent aggregate formation by amyloidogenic polypeptides including polyQ containing proteins (8Vos M.J. Zijlstra M.P. Kanon B. van Waarde-Verhagen M.A. Brunt E.R. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Carra S. Sibon O.C. Kampinga H.H.

Genet. 2010; 19 (20843828): 4677-469310.1093/hmg/ddq398Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). First, we asked whether this protective function of HSPB7 against polyQ aggregation seen in cells is related to a direct action of the chaperone on the substrate. Hereto, we incubated a purified exon-1 fragment of mutant Huntingtin with 48 glutamines (mHttQ48) with either purified HSPB7 or HSPB1 (with HSPB1 acting as control as it is unable unable to protect against polyQ aggregation in cells (8Vos M.J. Zijlstra M.P. Kanon B. van Waarde-Verhagen M.A. Brunt E.R. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Carra S. Sibon O.C. Kampinga H.H.

Genet. 2010; 19 (20843828): 4677-469310.1093/hmg/ddq398Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)). Analyzing the ratio of soluble:insoluble mHttQ48 by gel electrophoresis (9Mymrikov E.V. Daake M. Richter B. Haslbeck M. Buchner J. The chaperone activity and substrate spectrum of human small heat shock proteins.J. Biol.

The rate of decline in the soluble:insoluble ratio of mHttQ48 was unaffected by co-incubation with HSPB1 but clearly slowed down by the presence of HSPB7 (Fig. 1, A and B), meaning that HSPB7 acts directly on the aggregation process. Next, we asked what structural characteristics in HSPB7 specifies this activity toward suppressing aggregation of polyQ proteins. The NTDs and CTDs of HSPBs display the highest level of variability and have been suggested to be crucial for their differential function (17Carra S. Alberti S. Arrigo P.A. Benesch J.L. Benjamin I.J.

Our earlier data had revealed that the CTD of HSPB7 is not required for its activity to prevent polyQ aggregation (8Vos M.J. Zijlstra M.P. Kanon B. van Waarde-Verhagen M.A. Brunt E.R. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Carra S. Sibon O.C. Kampinga H.H. HSPB7 is the most potent polyQ aggregation suppressor within the HSPB family of molecular chaperones.Hum. Mol.

So, we focused our attention on the NTD of HSPB7 and noted a serine-rich stretch (SRS) (Fig. 1C, Fig. S1A) that is not found in other HSPB members. Interestingly, a serine-rich stretch has been identified as a crucial segment in the ability of DNAJB6, a Hsp70 co-chaperone, to suppress polyQ aggregation (19Hageman J.

Although structurally distinct (Fig. S1A) we first set out to test the importance of the NTD in HSPB7, and in particular its SRS, in its action to suppress polyQ aggregation by generating a series of NTD truncations of HSPB7 mutants (Fig. 1C) that we co-expressed in cells together with an exon-1 fragment of Huntingtin with 74 glutamines tagged to GFP (mHttQ74–GFP). In contrast to our speculations, deleting the SRS from HSPB7 (v5-HSPB7ΔS17–29) did not result in a loss of its anti-aggregation activity (Fig. 1, D–F), despite its relatively lower expression as compared with that of WT HSPB7 (Fig. S1B). However, a gradual decline in anti-aggregation activity was found upon progressive NTD deletion with the complete deletion of the NTD (v5-HSPB7Δ73), being inactive (Fig. 1, D–F, Fig. S1B). None of the HSPB7 variants caused an induction of the heat shock response, evidenced by the absence of induced expression of HSPA6, an exclusive HSF-1–regulated chaperone (21Ramirez V.P. Stamatis M.

Finally, endogenous expression of HSPB7 is undetectable in these cells irrespective of expression of the HSPB7 variants (not shown) implying that protective effects of the mutants cannot be attributed to formation of complexes between full-length endogenous and the ectopically expressed HSPB7 variants. Three algorithms designed to predict intrinsically disordered regions (25Kozlowski L.P. Bujnicki J.M.

In fact, HSPB7 has been shown to be associated with intranuclear RNA speckles (SC35 speckles) and the fusion of its NTD to other small HSPBs like HSPB1 (of which the NTD is less disordered: Fig. S1, D and E) suffices to drive their association with these SC35 speckles, suggesting it might induce phase separation of the proteins it interacts with to prevent amyloidogenesis (30Vos M.J. Kanon B. Kampinga H.H. HSPB7 is a SC35 speckle resident small heat shock protein.Biochim. Biophys.

Whereas for polyQ proteins, a protective role for chaperone-mediated phase separation has not been established, it has been speculated that in yeast compartmentalization of polyQ proteins into so-called “insoluble protein deposit” may have physiological, cell protective relevance (31Kaganovich D. Kopito R. Frydman J.

Prakash A. Tyedmers J. The insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) in yeast.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2018; 11 (30050408): 23710.3389/fnmol.2018.00237Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In HEK293 cells, WT HSPB7 (v5-HSPB7WT) indeed colocalizes with mHttQ74–GFP inclusions and this co-localization is much reduced for the NTD deletion mutant (v5-HSPB7Δ73) (Fig. 1G). Moreover, whereas full-length HSPB7 was bound to mHttQ74–GFP in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the NTD deletion mutant (v5-HSPB7Δ73) was not (Fig. 1H). This could suggest that binding of HSPB7 to polyQ proteins drives its phase separation and hence prevents its aggregation into SDS-insoluble amyloids. Our initial attempts to co-express mHttQ74–GFP with only the NTD of HSPB7 (NTDHSPB7) failed as the NTD alone is not stable when expressed in cells (Fig. S2A). To test whether the predicted major IDR fragment of HSPB7 suffices to prevent polyQ aggregation, we therefore tagged the polyQ fragment directly with the NTD of HSPB7 (Fig. 2, A–D, Fig. S2B). However, for both fragments with either 43 or 74 CAG repeats, tagging with the NTDHSPB7 did not prevent polyQ aggregation, but rather enhanced it (Fig. 2, A–D). These data imply binding of HSPB7 to polyQ proteins and a putative subsequent phase separation driven by its NTD as such is insufficient to prevent polyQ aggregation. Direct fusion of the full-length HSPB7 to polyQ-74 did prevent aggregation indicating that the NTD in these hybrid fusion proteins is functional (Fig. 2, E and F, Fig. S2C). Since we previously showed that the CTD of HSPB7 is dispensable for its action on polyQ (8Vos M.J. Zijlstra M.P. Kanon B. van Waarde-Verhagen M.A. Brunt E.R. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Carra S. Sibon O.C. Kampinga H.H. HSPB7 is the most potent polyQ aggregation suppressor within the HSPB family of molecular chaperones.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19 (20843828): 4677-469310.1093/hmg/ddq398Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the combined data suggest that interaction of a (monomeric) HSPB7 via its NTD to polyQ proteins and the presence of the ACD of HSPB7 suffice to prevent mHtt aggregation. We next hypothesized that fusing the NTD of HSPB7 to the ACD of other HSPBs may turn these into polyQ aggregation preventive chaperones. As mentioned above, HSPB7 does not form homo- nor hetero-oligomers with any of the HSPBs, so targeting the other HSPBs to polyQ aggregates via hetero-oligomerization is unlikely to occur. To test whether the NTD of HSPB7 could turn another HSPB protein into an effective inhibitor of polyQ aggregation we choose HSPB1, as neither its presence in vitro (Fig. 1, A and B) nor its overexpression in cells (Fig. 3, B–D, Fig. S3A) could inhibit polyQ aggregation. Strikingly, expression of a fusion of the NTD of HSPB7 with the ACD and C-terminal domain of HSPB1 (NTDHSPB7–HSPB1) lead to reduced mHttQ74–GFP aggregation comparable with the effect of HSPB7WT expression (Fig. 3, A–D). This result indicated that the conserved ACD is a necessary structural requirement for HSPB7 to prevent polyQ aggregation. Strikingly, this requirement is not restricted to the ACD of HSPB7 as also the ACD of HSPB1 can exert this function. Indeed, a fusion of the NTDHSPB7 to mRFP (as a control) did not generate a hybrid protein that could prevent mHttQ74 aggregation (Fig. S3, B and C). In line with the biochemical data, we found that although WT HSPB1 did not co-localize with mHttQ74–GFP, the NTDHSPB7–HSPB1 hybrid did (Fig. 3E). Inversely, replacing the NTD of HSPB7 with the NTD of HSPB1 resulted in a hybrid protein (NTDHSPB1–HSPB7) that had lost its anti-polyQ–aggregation activity (Fig. 3, F and G, Fig. S3D) and no longer co-localized with the polyQ aggregates (Fig. 3H). The co-localization of polyQ with HSPB7 and NTDHSPB7–HSPB1 suggested that the NTD of HSPB7 is both required and sufficient for association of small HSPB proteins with polyQ proteins. This was confirmed by GFP pulldown experiments with mHttQ74–GFP. Whereas HSPB7WT was clearly co-precipitating with mHttQ74–GFP, HSPB7Δ73 did not (Fig. 1H). Inversely, whereas HSPB1WT did not co-IP with mHttQ74–GFP, NTDHSPB7–HSPB1 did (Fig. 3I). These data confirm that the NTD of HSPB7 drives the interaction between HSPB7 and polyQ proteins. Because the interaction in our co-IP experiments is performed on soluble material, these data further suggest that the N terminus of HSPB7 can already bind to polyQ prior to its insolubilization into high molecular weight aggregates. This mode of action is analogous to those of other small HSPs that need to be present prior to aggregation to be most active as well (7Carra S. Rusmini P. Crippa V. Giorgetti E. Boncoraglio A. Cristofani R. Naujock M. Meister M. Minoia M. Kampinga H.H. Poletti A.

Our data suggest that the flanking regions, here the NTD, are required and sufficient for targeting small HSPs to their substrates and that the ACD enables the suppression of aggregation. How can the NTD of HSPB7 turn HSPB1 into a protein that now can bind to polyQ proteins and suppress their aggregation? Because, HSPB7 does not form oligomers like the canonical small HSPs including HSPB1 (8Vos M.J. Zijlstra M.P. Kanon B. van Waarde-Verhagen M.A. Brunt E.R. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Carra S. Sibon O.C. Kampinga H.H. HSPB7 is the most potent polyQ aggregation suppressor within the HSPB family of molecular chaperones.Hum. Mol.

Sucrose gradient centrifugation of whole cell extracts confirmed that WT HSPB1 is polydispersed (Fig. 4A), reminiscent of being present as dynamic oligomers in cells. In contrast, WT HSPB7 predominantly runs in a monodispersed peak, likely representing dimers. (Fig. 4A). Deletion of the NTD from HSPB7 (HSPB7Δ73) does not change this behavior (Fig. 4A), implying that loss of its anti-aggregation activity is not related to a change into a more polydispersed form. Importantly, fusion of the HSPB7–NTD to HSPB1 (NTDHSPB7–HSPB1) has a strong impact on the oligomeric properties of HSPB1. The NTDHSPB7–HSPB1 chimera was found to sediment in the sa"

This product was used as raw matter (RM) to produce biochar enriched with phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB). Biochar potential as biofertilizer was evaluated in Allium cepa culture at greenhouse scale. Experiments including lignocellulosic mix and LDPEoxo were performed for 75 days in microcosm. Biotransformation progress was performed by monitoring total organic carbon (TOC), CO2 production, laccase (Lac), manganese peroxidase (MnP), and lignin peroxidase (LiP) enzymatic activities. Physical LDPEoxo changes were assessed by atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and static contact angle (SCA) and chemical changes by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Results revealed P. ostreatus was capable of LCB and LDPEoxo biotransformation, obtaining 41% total organic carbon (TOC) removal with CO2 production of 2,323 mg Kg-1 and enzyme activities of 169,438 UKg-1, 5,535 UKg-1 and 5,267 UKg-1 for LiP, MnP and Lac, respectively. Regarding LDPEoxo, SCA was decreased by 84%, with an increase in signals at 1,076 cm-1 and 3,271 cm-1, corresponding to C-O and CO-H bonds. A decrease in signals was observed related to material degradation at 2,928 cm-1, 2,848 cm-1, agreeing with CH2 asymmetrical and symmetrical stretching, respectively. PSB enriched biochar favored A. cepa plant growth during the five-week evaluation period.

https://openalex.org/W2945331019,"Hepatic fibrosis, characterized by an excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation, leading to scar-tissue formation is a growing health problem worldwide. Hepatocellular damage due to liver injury triggers inflammation and transdifferentiation of quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) into proliferative, contractile, and ECM-producing myofibroblasts. Involvement of the Janus kinase (JAK)-2 pathway in the pathogenesis of fibrosis has been reported earlier. However, in this study, we have investigated the effect of selective JAK2 antagonist TG101348 in fibroblasts and inflammatory macrophages and in vivo in an acute carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury mouse model. In vitro, TG101348 significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced collagen I expression in murine 3T3 fibroblasts. In human HSCs (LX2 cells), TG101348 potently attenuated TGF-β-induced contractility and the protein and gene expression of major fibrotic parameters (collagen I, vimentin, and α-smooth muscle actin). In LPS- and IFN-γ-stimulated inflammatory macrophages, TG101348 significantly reduced the NO release and strongly inhibited the expression of inflammatory markers (inducible nitric oxide synthase, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, IL-1β, IL-6, and C-C chemokine receptor type 2). In vivo in an acute liver injury mouse model, TG101348 significantly attenuated collagen accumulation and HSC activation. Interestingly, TG101348 drastically inhibited macrophage infiltration and intrahepatic inflammation.

Methods Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of umbilical cord samples from 519 Singaporean infants involved in a prospective birth cohort ‘Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes’ (GUSTO) was performed using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K chip microarray. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess any associations between site-specific CpG methylation of umbilical cord tissue at birth and myopia risk in 3 year old children, adjusting for potential confounders. Gene expression of genes located near CpG sites that demonstrated statistically significant associations were measured in relevant ocular tissues using human and mouse fetal and adult eye samples. Results We identified statistically significant associations between DNA methylation levels at five CpG sites and early-onset myopia risk after correcting for multiple comparisons using a false discovery rate of 5%. Two statistically significant CpG sites were identified in intergenic regions: 8p23(p = 1.70×10−7) and 12q23.2(p = 2.53×10−7). The remaining 3 statistically significant CpG sites were identified within the following genes: FGB (4q28, p = 3.60×10−7), PQLC1 (18q23, p = 8.9×10−7) and KRT12 (17q21.2, p = 1.2×10−6). Both PQLC1 and KRT12 were found to be significantly expressed in fetal and adult cornea and sclera tissues in both human and mouse. Conclusions We identified five CpG methylation sites that demonstrate a statistically significant association with increased risk of developing early-onset myopia. These findings suggest that variability in the neonatal cord epigenome may influence early-onset myopia risk in children. Further studies of the epigenetic influences on myopia risk in larger study populations, and the associations with adulthood myopia risk are warranted."

Chymotrypsin-related proteases that form the PA clan in the MEROPS classification of proteases is one of the largest and most diverse group of proteases. The PA clan comprises serine proteases from bacteria, eukaryotes, archaea, and viruses and chymotrypsin-related cysteine proteases from positive-strand RNA viruses. Despite low amino acid sequence identity, all PA clan proteases share a conserved double β-barrel structure. Using an automated structure-based hierarchical clustering method, we identified a common structural core of 72 amino acid residues for 143 PA clan proteases that represent 12 protein families and 11 subfamilies. The identified core is located around the catalytic site between the two β-barrels and resembles the structures of the smallest PA clan proteases. We constructed a structure-based distance tree derived from the properties of the identified common core. Our structure-based analyses support the current classification of these proteases at the subfamily level and largely at the family level. Structural alignment and structure-based distance trees could thus be used for directing objective classification of PA clan proteases and to strengthen their higher order classification. Our results also indicate that the PA clan proteases of positive-strand RNA viruses are related to cellular heat-shock proteases, which suggests that the exchange of protease genes between viruses and cells might have occurred more than once."
https://openalex.org/W2946792289,"Objectives The purpose of this study was to Identify whether changes in heart rate variability (HRV) could be detected as critical illness resolves by comparing HRV from the time of pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission with HRV immediately prior to discharge. We also sought to demonstrate that HRV derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) data from bedside monitors can be calculated in critically-ill children using a real-time, streaming analytics platform. Methods This was a retrospective, observational pilot study of 17 children aged 0 to 18 years admitted to the PICU of a free-standing, academic children’s hospital. Three time-domain measures of HRV were calculated in real-time from bedside monitor ECG data and stored for analysis. Measures included: root mean square of successive differences between NN intervals (RMSSD), percent of successive NN interval differences above 50 ms (pNN50), and the standard deviation of NN intervals (SDNN). Results HRV values calculated from the first and last 24 hours of PICU stay were analyzed. Mixed effects models demonstrated that all three measures of HRV were significantly lower during the first 24 hours compared to the last 24 hours of PICU admission (p<0.001 for all three measures). In models exploring the relationship between time from admission and log HRV values, the predicted average HRV remained consistently higher in the last 24 hours of PICU stay compared to the first 24 hours. Conclusion HRV was significantly lower in the first 24 hours compared to the 24 hours preceding PICU discharge, after resolution of critical illness. This demonstrates that it is feasible to detect changes in HRV using an automated, streaming analytics platform. Continuous tracking of HRV may serve as a marker of recovery in critically ill children."

The Malaria Control Program of Ghana has implemented Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC) intervention in the Upper West Region in 2015. This preventive drug has been recommended by WHO as very safe and effective in preventing malaria in children under five years. This study assessed community acceptability of the SMC intervention in the Lawra district of Northern Ghana. Methodology This was a qualitative study where focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were conducted with community-based health volunteers and parents whose children received the SMC drug. Purposive sampling method was used to select study participants. The interviews were recorded with consent of study participants. All interviews were transcribed and coded into emergent themes using Nvivo 10 software before thematic content analysis. Results Study participants perceived that the introduction of the SMC intervention in the area had helped to reduce the prevalence of malaria among children less than five years of age. Parents held the view that the drug was very good in preventing malaria. The results also showed high acceptability of the SMC intervention by parents and other community members. Parents reported that they were willing to allow their children to receive the drug and wished the intervention could continue in the district for children to continue to benefit. Nonetheless, negative attitude on the part of few parents made them not to allow their children to receive the drug. Conclusion The interpretation of our data showed high acceptability of the SMC by stakeholders in the study area. However, intensive and continued health education on the benefits of the SMC drug could help to further improve acceptability of the program."

From 105,661 people, subjects on chronic dialysis and subjects without consecutive medical checkups were excluded. Finally, medical costs in the follow-up year categorized by annual changes in eGFR between baseline and the next year were longitudinally examined in 70,627 people ranging in age from 40 to 74 years. Global mean costs for subjects with a rapid decrease in eGFR (≤-30%/year) were the highest among all ΔeGFR categories. In men, the cost was 1.42 times that for a stable eGFR. A total of 6,268 (19.4%) men and 5,381 (14.0%) women with eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 were identified in the baseline year. The mean cost was higher with a low eGFR than without a low eGFR, and there were also higher proportions newly initiating dialysis in 2014 (low eGFR with rapid decrease in eGFR vs. with stable eGFR: 9.61% vs. 0.02% in women, P<0.001). Moreover, the costs for low eGFR subjects with a rapid decrease in eGFR were more than twice those of non-low eGFR subjects with a rapid decrease in eGFR and also compared to low eGFR subjects with a stable eGFR. Moreover, initiating chronic dialysis was considered one of the major causes of high medical costs in women with rapid eGFR decline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of renal disease using a cohort developed from the KDB system recently established in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2946637749,"Introduction A Cloud-ORiented Engine for advanced MRI simulations (coreMRI) is presented in this study. The aim was to develop the first advanced MR simulation platform delivered as a web service through an on-demand, scalable cloud-based and GPU-based infrastructure. We hypothesized that such an online MR simulation platform could be utilized as a virtual MRI scanner but also as a cloud-based, high-performance engine for advanced MR simulations in simulation-based quantitative MR (qMR) methods. Methods and results The simulation framework of coreMRI was based on the solution of the Bloch equations and utilized a ground-up-approach design based on the principles already published in the literature. The development of a front-end environment allowed the connection of the end-users to the GPU-equipped instances on the cloud. The coreMRI simulation platform was based on a modular design where individual modules (such as the Gadgetron reconstruction framework and a newly developed Pulse Sequence Designer) could be inserted in the main simulation framework. Different types and sources of pulse sequences and anatomical models were utilized in this study revealing the flexibility that the coreMRI simulation platform offers to the users. The performance and scalability of coreMRI were also examined on multi-GPU configurations on the cloud, showing that a multi-GPU computer on the cloud equipped with a newer generation of GPU cards could significantly mitigate the prolonged execution times that accompany more realistic MRI and qMR simulations. Conclusions coreMRI is available to the entire MR community, whereas its high performance and scalability allow its users to configure advanced MRI experiments without the constraints imposed by experimentation in a true MRI scanner (such as time constraint and limited availability of MR scanners), without upfront investment for purchasing advanced computer systems and without any user expertise on computer programming or MR physics. coreMRI is available to the users through the webpage https://www.coreMRI.org."

Treatment effects are usually the direct result of a mismatch between false visual feedback and somatosensory/proprioceptive feedback. We aimed to influence physical activity (walking distance) using a memory-related perceptual illusion that relies on a mismatch between a spatially manipulated virtual reality environment and a weakness of memory for a similar, previously experienced environment. Participants' main task was to reproduce a baseline distance three times, by walking on a treadmill while moving through a virtual reality environment. Depending on condition, the environment was either stretched or compressed relative to the previous session, but participants were not informed about these manipulations. Because false, suggestive information can lead to alterations in memory, especially when conveyed through ‘rich’ forms of media such as virtual reality, we expected each manipulation to alter memory for the previous environment(s) and we hypothesized that this would influence walking distance. The results for the first time showed that memory-related perceptual illusions can directly affect physical activity in humans. The effects we found are substantial; stretching previously experienced virtual environments led participants to almost double their initial walking distance, whereas compressing the environments resulted in about half of the initial distance. Possible clinical applications arising from these findings are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2946403638,"I walked up to the professor, heart pounding. “Could we talk about the group discussions?” I asked hesitantly. Much of my grade for the course, a prerequisite for my master's degree, depended on my performance in those discussions. But I had a hard time speaking up, and when I did, everyone—including the instructor—seemed to disagree with me. I wanted to do better, but I didn't know how. I had arrived in the United States from India just a few months earlier, and I did not know what was expected of me or how the academic system operated. I was confused and desperate for help.

ILLUSTRATION: ROBERT NEUBECKER

“You're too nice!” the professor said. “You're very quick to agree with everyone, and you never stand up for yourself.” I was taken aback. Was I allowed to disagree with a professor? All my previous training had taught me otherwise. Clearly there was a whole set of rules I didn't know. I wondered whether I ever would.

Since my arrival in the United States, my internal chatter had been a steady stream of uncertainty. When ordering food, what is “to go,” and is it different from a parcel? Which side of the road do I stand on to catch the bus? Oops, I called a cookie a biscuit again. Why would someone ask me how I'm doing if they don't wait to hear my response? Am I speaking too fast? Too slow? How do I pronounce my R's?

These struggles extended to the university. I didn't understand the “shopping” or add-drop periods for classes and spent my first week stressed out about meeting the credit requirements of my university fellowship. I struggled with assignments that tested my thinking and presentation skills instead of asking me to memorize and regurgitate information. The approach to grading was peculiar and confusing. When I went to my first conference, I was convinced that I didn't fit in.

I didn't know there was a term for my confusion until a few months ago, when Twitter introduced me to the idea of the “hidden curriculum”—the social and professional norms in academia that are second nature to many but opaque to others, especially scholars from underrepresented groups and other countries, like me. Examples include knowing when it is appropriate to ask for mentorship, understanding research funding structures, and being familiar with standard language used in academic syllabi such as “office hours.” If you know these things, you barely notice them. If you don't, they are completely bewildering. They usually aren't formally taught or explained, so it's up to us to figure them out, one way or another.

For me, things started to take a turn for the better when I realized I could reach out for help, particularly from more senior international graduate students. Before my second conference, for example, another student advised me on issues including dress codes, networking, and how to navigate social events. I began to build up a compendium of information—rules of thumb that are obvious to students already familiar with the U.S. higher education system but invaluable for outsiders.

After I got my master's degree, I worked in India for a couple of years before returning to the United States for my Ph.D. I still encounter the hidden curriculum. I only recently realized, for instance, that what I learned about speaking up in class when I was a master's student also applies to my relationships with my current mentors.

But I've come a long way. When I came back to the United States, I knew that I had to advocate for myself and purposefully build a community for support and advice. I got involved with a university organization for female graduate students in the sciences, and I represented the group at a welcome event for incoming students. As I answered their questions I suddenly realized that, even though I was still learning, I had knowledge to share that could help others navigate the hidden curriculum.

Entering an unfamiliar world brings challenges but also an opportunity: to create a community, almost a proxy family, to ease our academic journeys. We can thrive by seeking out “obvious” information, asking hard questions, and advocating for ourselves and everyone who comes after us.

https://openalex.org/W2945139821,"We investigated the contribution of host immune cells to bacterial killing in a whole-blood bactericidal activity (WBA) assay, an ex vivo model used to test efficacy of drugs against mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We performed WBA assays with immuno-magnetic depletion of specific cell types, in the presence or absence of rifampicin. Innate immune cells decreased Mtb growth in absence of drug, but appeared to diminish the cidal activity of rifampicin, possibly attributable to intracellular bacterial sequestration. Adaptive immune cells had no effect with or without drug. The WBA assay may have potential for testing adjunctive host-directed therapies acting on phagocytic cells."

It has two working modes, that is the lift-based normal anti-rolling mode and the drag-based zero-speed anti-rolling mode. Different force generation mechanisms cause different control methods, especially in the form of control. The zero-speed fin stabilizer works in a sinusoidal fashion in normal mode, the same as the conventional fin stabilizer. However, its control form at zero speed is not particularly clear. This paper aims to investigate the control form of fin stabilizer at zero speed through a composite method of theoretical analysis and experimental research. Based on the established reaction force model, the forces generated on the fin flapped in sinusoidal and trapezoidal forms are compared and analyzed. It is found that the trapezoidal form flapping with a small half-cycle ratio generates larger force than the sinusoidal flapping form when the flapping amplitude is the same. The forced rolling tank tests with the fins flapping in sinusoidal and trapezoidal forms were conducted. The test results are consistent with the theoretical analysis results, and the trapezoidal flapping form with a proper small half-cycle ratio is recommended for fin stabilizers at zero speed. The control strategy of fin stabilizer at zero speed is obtained based on the further analysis of the force characteristics of the trapezoidal flapping form and the limitations of the actual fin stabilizer actuation system. The model and full scale roll reduction tests at zero speed were conducted, achieving more than 70% and 60% of the anti-rolling effect respectively. The test results further verify the effectiveness, applicability and practicability of the obtained control form and strategy for fin stabilizers in at-anchor conditions, and can be a reference for engineering practice and other similar studies."

Most mothers continue to give birth at home. This study aims at identifying the socio-cultural practices, perceived benefit or need, and accessibility factors influencing women's choice of health facilities for delivery services in Gida Ayana Woreda, western Ethiopia.We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess women's use of delivery care services in Gida Ayana Woreda, from November 2016 to January 2017; 459 women who were selected randomly participated in the study. We evaluated the socio-cultural, perceived benefit or need, and economic and physical accessibility factors in women's choice of delivery care and used adjusted logistic regression analysis to examine significant predictors of delivery site use decisions.Over half (56.6%) of the women self-reported using institutional delivery care; 80.9% gave birth at a health center. A socio-cultural variable, maternal education, significantly influenced women's choice of health facility for delivery care services (AOR 3.4; 95% CI 2.0-5.9). Mothers' knowledge level of obstetric complications and experience of complications during the last birth were the two perceived benefits or need factors associated with higher odds of receiving delivery care from decentralized local facilities. Utilization of health centers for maternal delivery care was significantly higher than of health posts (AOR 5.0; 95% CI 2.4-10.2). Availability of motorized transportation during labor to nearby delivery site was a significant predictor of institutional delivery.This study demonstrates the under-utilization of decentralized health facilities for maternal delivery care services in Gida Ayana Woreda, which was significantly influenced by socio-cultural, perceived need, and accessibility factors of women during childbirth. This suggests the need for tailored intervention to improve childbirth services use for mothers in this kind of rural settings."
https://openalex.org/W2945459940,"Social cognitive skills training interventions for psychotic disorders have shown improvement in social cognitive performance tasks, but little was known about brain-based biomarkers linked to treatment effects. In this pilot study, we examined whether social cognitive skills training could modulate extrinsic and intrinsic functional connectivity in psychosis using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Twenty-six chronic outpatients with psychotic disorders were recruited from either a Social Cognitive Skills Training (SCST) or an activity- and time-matched control intervention. At baseline and the end of intervention (12 weeks), participants completed two social cognitive tasks: a Facial Affect Matching task and a Mental State Attribution Task, as well as resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI). Extrinsic functional connectivity was assessed using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) with amygdala and temporo-parietal junction as a seed region for the Facial Affect Matching Task and the Mental State Attribution task, respectively. Intrinsic functional connectivity was assessed with independent component analysis on rs-fMRI, with a focus on the default mode network (DMN). During the Facial Affect Matching task, we observed stronger PPI connectivity in the SCST group after intervention (compared to baseline), but no treatment-related change in the Control group. Neither group showed treatment-related changes in PPI connectivity during the Mental State Attribution task. During rs-fMRI, we found treatment-related changes in the DMN in the SCST group, but not in Control group. This study found that social cognitive skills training modulated both extrinsic and intrinsic functional connectivity in individuals with psychotic disorders after a 12-week intervention. These findings suggest treatment-related changes in functional connectivity as a potential brain-based biomarker of social cognitive skills training."
