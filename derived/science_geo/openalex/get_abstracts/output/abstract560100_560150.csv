https://openalex.org/W2384699986,"Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in pregnant women causes intrauterine growth restriction, spontaneous abortion, and microcephaly. Here, we describe two mouse models of placental and fetal disease associated with in utero transmission of ZIKV. Female mice lacking type I interferon signaling (Ifnar1(-/-)) crossed to wild-type (WT) males produced heterozygous fetuses resembling the immune status of human fetuses. Maternal inoculation at embryonic day 6.5 (E6.5) or E7.5 resulted in fetal demise that was associated with ZIKV infection of the placenta and fetal brain. We identified ZIKV within trophoblasts of the maternal and fetal placenta, consistent with a trans-placental infection route. Antibody blockade of Ifnar1 signaling in WT pregnant mice enhanced ZIKV trans-placental infection although it did not result in fetal death. These models will facilitate the study of ZIKV pathogenesis, in utero transmission, and testing of therapies and vaccines to prevent congenital malformations."

PARIS is a generally applicable and versatile method that provides novel insights into the RNA structurome and interactome. RNA structure and intermolecular interactions are essential in nearly every step of the gene expression program. Structured RNAs are critical components of key molecular machines in the cell, such as the spliceosome, ribosome, and telomerase, and RNA structures play important roles in the control of mRNA and noncoding RNA functions (Cech and Steitz, 2014Cech T.R.

Base pairing dominates the energetics of both RNA folding and RNA-RNA interactions. Despite recent advances in measuring RNA structures in living cells (Ding et al., 2014Ding Y. Tang Y. Kwok C.K.

That is, these methods identify which bases are single or double stranded but do not directly reveal the counter-parties in each base pair (Lu and Chang, 2016Lu Z. Chang H.Y. Decoding the RNA structurome.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2016; 36: 142-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inferring transcriptome structure in living cells is especially challenging, due to the presence of long-range structures, pseudoknots, alternative structures, repetitive sequences, and RNA-RNA interactions. One example illustrating these difficulties is XIST, a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) required for X chromosome inactivation in female cells of eutherian animals (Penny et al., 1996Penny G.D. Kay G.F.

The key region for XIST-mediated epigenetic silencing, termed the A-repeat, is comprised of 7.5 or 8.5 near-identical copies of a sequence, and multiple structural models have been proposed (Fang et al., 2015Fang R.

These challenges highlight the need for further advances to address the structures of the vast majority of coding and noncoding RNAs in the cell.

While these methods can identify RNA base pairs, current methods are limited by specific protein or RNA baits, which are performed one at a time and have limited resolution especially for longer RNAs (Engreitz et al., 2014Engreitz J.M. Sirokman K. McDonel P. Shishkin A.A. Surka C. Russell P. Grossman S.R. Chow A.Y. Guttman M. Lander E.S.

Here, we describe a general method that directly identifies base-pairing interactions in living cells and, by doing so, determines both RNA structures and RNA-RNA interactions. PARIS (psoralen analysis of RNA interactions and structures) combines several critical steps (in vivo crosslinking, 2D purification of RNA duplexes, and proximity ligation) that yield excellent sensitivity and specificity, as validated by numerous known structures and evolutionary conservation. We discovered a large number of long-range and alternative structures. PARIS-determined structures contain many targets of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding proteins (STAU1, DICER1, DGCR8). Furthermore, the high confidence structures guide two new approaches for phylogenetic analysis of RNA structures, revealing conserved architectures in housekeeping gene mRNAs. The combination of PARIS, icSHAPE (in vivo click selective 2′-hydroxyl acylation and profiling experiment), phylogenetic analysis, and iCLIP (individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) reveals the overall architecture of the XIST lncRNA and the mechanism of SPEN binding to XIST A-repeat. Current methods for in vivo probing generate averaged reactivity profiles and fail to capture the complexity of RNA structures that include long-range structures, pseudo-knots, and alternative conformations. To address these challenges, we developed PARIS to directly identify base-paired helices, the most basic elements in RNA structures and RNA-RNA interactions (Figures 1 and S1; Table S1; Experimental Procedures). The PARIS method employs the highly specific and reversible nucleic acid crosslinker psoralen-derivative 4′-aminomethyltrioxsalen (AMT) to fix base pairs in living cells (Calvet and Pederson, 1979Calvet J.P. Pederson T. Heterogeneous nuclear RNA double-stranded regions probed in living HeLa cells by crosslinking with the psoralen derivative aminomethyltrioxsalen.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1979; 76: 755-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). AMT intercalates in RNA helices and, upon photo-activation, crosslinks the two strands, with a preference for staggered uridines (Cimino et al., 1985Cimino G.D. Gamper H.B. Isaacs S.T. Hearst J.E. Psoralens as photoactive probes of nucleic acid structure and function: organic chemistry, photochemistry, and biochemistry.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1151-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Partial RNase and complete proteinase digestion during RNA purification ensures that the identified crosslinks are limited to small and directly base-paired RNA fragments (Figures S1A–S1C). Two-dimension electrophoresis of the RNase-digested fragments enables purification of only crosslinked fragments (above the main diagonal, Figures 1A, 1B, S1D, and S1E). The 2D purification consistently recovers 0.2%–0.5% of input RNA as double-stranded (above the diagonal), demonstrating that 2D purification is essential for enriching dsRNA fragments. Proximity ligation of duplex RNA fragments, photo-reversal of crosslinks, and high throughput sequencing reveal the direct base pairing between fragments. Each PARIS read is an individual-molecule evidence of a duplex between two RNA fragments (arms). The multiplicity of PARIS reads can thus reveal a single common structure, multiple alternative structures, or interactions between two RNAs in trans (Figures 1D–1G). The combination of these important features allows us to model RNA structures and interactions with high specificity and sensitivity.Figure S1Development and Optimization of the PARIS Method and PARIS Experiments on HEK293T Cells and Mouse ES Cells, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) RNase digestion is required for efficient extraction of RNA from AMT-crosslinked cells.

We performed PARIS on human HeLa, HEK293T, and mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells and generated a total of 350 million reads after removing duplicates. The gapped reads, arising from RNase digestion of single-stranded loops in RNA structure, constitute 2.5%–6% of all mappable reads (Figures 1B and S1; Table S1). Given the absence of any background above the diagonal in the −AMT controls (Figure 1B), the non-gapped reads may come from failed ligations of duplexes due to steric hindrance (Sugimoto et al., 2015Sugimoto Y. Vigilante A. Darbo E. Zirra A. Militti C. D’Ambrogio A. Luscombe N.M. Ule J. hiCLIP reveals the in vivo atlas of mRNA secondary structures recognized by Staufen 1.Nature. 2015; 519: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). PARIS is highly reproducible across biological replicates in each of the three cell types (R = 0.94–0.98 between replicates; Figures 1C, S1F, and S1G). We assembled gapped reads into duplex groups (DG), each corresponding to an RNA stem loop, with the two arms from the stem and the gap from the RNase-cleaved loop, or an RNA-RNA interaction, with the two arms from the two interacting RNAs (Figures 1E–1G). DGs are filtered to retain only the ones with high confidence supported by multiple reads. To visualize this new type of RNA structurome data and associated structure models, we developed new features in the Integrative Genome Viewer (Robinson et al., 2011Robinson J.T. Thorvaldsdóttir H. Winckler W. Guttman M. Lander E.S. Getz G. Mesirov J.P. Integrative genomics viewer.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 24-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (7587) Google Scholar) (Figure 1D). Gapped reads are displayed in groups by DG, and structure models are visualized as arcs connecting the two arms of each DG (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for the detailed analysis methods, directions, and links to visualization of PARIS data). We validated the sensitivity and specificity of PARIS using a number of well-studied RNAs, such as rRNA, small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and microRNA (Figures 1H, 1I, and S2). Complex RNA structures are currently difficult to detect using one-dimensional chemical probing or computational prediction. Among the most difficult structures to predict are pseudoknots, comprised of interlocked helices, in which the loop of one stem loop participates in base pairing with an outside region. We were able to detect well-known pseudoknots in telomerase RNA (TERC; Figure 1J), RMRP, and RPPH1 (the RNA components of RNase MRP and RNase P, data not shown) in both human and mouse PARIS data. Having established the PARIS method, we investigated the global properties of the RNA structurome. Most previous experimental and computational methods can only identify short-range structures (i.e., the span from the beginning of the left arm of the duplex to the end of the right arm), typically focusing on <200 nt windows. We found that a large number of RNA duplexes (29%–40%) span >200 nt in the three cell types and 4%–11% of duplexes span greater than 1,000 nt (Figure 2A). We next investigated the extent to which RNA duplexes are organized into higher-level architectures. Many genomic studies categorize mRNAs into 5′ UTR, coding sequence (CDS), and 3′ UTR and perform analyses on these units assuming they are separate entities. We observed extensive RNA duplexes that cross these artificial boundaries. To illustrate the long-range structures, we plotted the number of DGs connecting among the first three and last three exons (Figure 2B). Even though most structures are local, as shown in Figure 2A, we observed many structures that span multiple exons (Figure 2B). For example in the RPS4X mRNA and other mRNAs, we observe multiple independent loops between the 5′ UTR and CDS, the CDS and 3′ UTR, the 5′ and 3′ UTRs (Figures 2C, 2D, S3A, and S3B), and the structures that cover the start and stop codons (Figures S3C and S3D). In addition, we also identified structures formed by repetitive elements like Alu elements (Figures S3E and S3F). The RNA structural features that dictate the specific recognition of dsRNA binding proteins (dsRBPs) to their cognate targets are not known, and PARIS identified the RNA structures associated with the dsRBP binding sites (Figure S4).Figure S4PARIS Identifies Binding Sites of dsRBPs, Related to Figure 2Show full captionRNA duplexes can create binding sites for dedicated dsRNA-binding proteins (dsRBPs) as well as occlude single-stranded regulatory RNA elements. Eukaryotic genomes encode a large number of dedicated dsRBPs, and several play important roles in regulating gene expression. Important dsRBPs include DGCR8 and DICER that are essential for microRNA and siRNA biogenesis, a distinct role for DICER in binding dsRNA stem-loops without processing (Macias et al., 2012; Rybak-Wolf et al., 2014), and STAU1 in regulated RNA decay (Kim et al., 2005). The targets of most dsRBPs studied so far are only known on the primary sequence level based on CLIP (presumably intra-molecular); a notable exception is STAU1, whose structure targets have been defined using crosslinking and protein pull-down followed by proximity ligation termed hiCLIP (Sugimoto et al., 2015Sugimoto Y. Vigilante A. Darbo E. Zirra A. Militti C. D’Ambrogio A. Luscombe N.M. Ule J. hiCLIP reveals the in vivo atlas of mRNA secondary structures recognized by Staufen 1.Nature. 2015; 519: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast to hiCLIP, which analyzes dsRBPs one by one, PARIS provides a comprehensive overview of all dsRBP binding sites. The vast majority of RNA duplexes we observe were not previously known from individual dsRBPs, and we expand the universe of experimentally confirmed RNA duplexes by ∼20-fold. Collectively, these results extend the concept of extensive long-range RNA structures in the transcriptome (Sugimoto et al., 2015Sugimoto Y. Vigilante A. Darbo E. Zirra A. Militti C. D’Ambrogio A. Luscombe N.M. Ule J. hiCLIP reveals the in vivo atlas of mRNA secondary structures recognized by Staufen 1.Nature. 2015; 519: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and indicate that this is a general feature rather than a private feature of individual RBPs. Given that the human genome encodes many dsRBPs, investigation of individual binding sites is laborious, PARIS can identify and validate targets for many dsRBPs at once (of course subject to the limitation of coverage). The incomplete overlap between PARIS and individual dsRBP targets is most likely due to current sequence coverage in PARIS. The sequence coverage of PARIS is spread across all RNA duplexes rather than just the targets of one RBP. The PARIS data alone does not reveal the identity of the proteins associated with the RNA stargets due to the lack of sequence specificity of most dsRBPs, instead, the integration of PARIS with CLIP data determines the structural targets of dsRBPs. Although likely, RBP binding does not necessarily exclude crosslinking since the helices can be longer than the RBP footprint and the RBP binding does not necessarily wrap the entire RBP footprint. It is possible that some RBP binding will inhibit the psoralen crosslinking, and this could contribute to the RBP binding sites not identified by PARIS.(A) First of all, we intersected the STAU1-associated structures with the PARIS-defined structures in HeLa cells and found that 21% of the STAU1-associated structures were identified by PARIS with nucleotide resolution overlap, despite that completely different experimental methods were used.(B and C) Comparison of the STAU1 hiCLIP (all three libraries combined) duplex groups to PARIS duplex groups (HeLa_LowRNase) in the exon4 region of SRSF1 (chr17:58000919-58007346). All 8 of the STAU1 hiCLIP duplex groups were detected in the PARIS data. In addition, there are many other duplex groups in PARIS not present in the STAU1 hiCLIP data. Black arcs: structures detected by both PARIS and STAU1 hiCLIP. Blue arcs: structures only detected by PARIS. DG1 (detected by both methods) and DG2 (detected by only PARIS) are shown in details in (C).(D) As an independent validation in HEK293 cells, we compared the PARIS data with the binding sites of dsRBP DGCR8 and DICER1, which are essential for miRNA biogenesis and also play miRNA-independent roles in gene expression. PARIS identifies 38% and 32% of the DICER1 and DGCR8 binding sites as defined by CLIP, respectively.(E) PARIS identifies MIRLET7F1 miRNA precursor, consistent with the DGCR8 and DICER1 iCLIP data. HeLa cells PARIS data were used here, since the HEK293 data were not deep enough for this RNA.(F) PARIS identifies non-canonical binding sites of DGCR8 and DICER1. Whereas CLIP data only showed the binding sites of the dsRBPs, PARIS revealed the structures that are associated with the proteins, and the structures may span a very long linear distance. Here shows the comparison between PARIS data and DGCR8 (Macias 2014), DICER1 (Rybak-Wolfe et al., 2013) CLIP data (HEK293T cells) in exon6 of ACTG1 gene (chr17: 81510479-81510833). PARIS: show arcs, coverage and DG alignments. DICER1 and DGCR8: show bed tracks and coverage tracks for both duplicates. Blue boxes: PARIS compared to DGCR8 binding sites.

Ule J. hiCLIP reveals the in vivo atlas of mRNA secondary structures recognized by Staufen 1.Nature. 2015; 519: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In contrast to hiCLIP, which analyzes dsRBPs one by one, PARIS provides a comprehensive overview of all dsRBP binding sites. The vast majority of RNA duplexes we observe were not previously known from individual dsRBPs, and we expand the universe of experimentally confirmed RNA duplexes by ∼20-fold. Collectively, these results extend the concept of extensive long-range RNA structures in the transcriptome (Sugimoto et al., 2015Sugimoto Y. Vigilante A. Darbo E. Zirra A. Militti C. D’Ambrogio A.

https://openalex.org/W2353111961,"Depression is a complex, heterogeneous disorder and a leading contributor to the global burden of disease. Most previous research has focused on individual brain regions and genes contributing to depression. However, emerging evidence in humans and animal models suggests that dysregulated circuit function and gene expression across multiple brain regions drive depressive phenotypes. Here, we performed RNA sequencing on four brain regions from control animals and those susceptible or resilient to chronic social defeat stress at multiple time points. We employed an integrative network biology approach to identify transcriptional networks and key driver genes that regulate susceptibility to depressive-like symptoms. Further, we validated in vivo several key drivers and their associated transcriptional networks that regulate depression susceptibility and confirmed their functional significance at the levels of gene transcription, synaptic regulation, and behavior. Our study reveals novel transcriptional networks that control stress susceptibility and offers fundamentally new leads for antidepressant drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2374078013,"Chromatin remodeling proteins are frequently dysregulated in human cancer, yet little is known about how they control tumorigenesis. Here, we uncover an epigenetic program mediated by the NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase Sirtuin 6 (SIRT6) that is critical for suppression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal malignancies. SIRT6 inactivation accelerates PDAC progression and metastasis via upregulation of Lin28b, a negative regulator of the let-7 microRNA. SIRT6 loss results in histone hyperacetylation at the Lin28b promoter, Myc recruitment, and pronounced induction of Lin28b and downstream let-7 target genes, HMGA2, IGF2BP1, and IGF2BP3. This epigenetic program defines a distinct subset with a poor prognosis, representing 30%-40% of human PDAC, characterized by reduced SIRT6 expression and an exquisite dependence on Lin28b for tumor growth. Thus, we identify SIRT6 as an important PDAC tumor suppressor and uncover the Lin28b pathway as a potential therapeutic target in a molecularly defined PDAC subset. PAPERCLIP."

MSNs form the two main outputs of the striatum: the direct pathway formed by long-range axonal projections from dMSNs to the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata, and the indirect pathway formed by long-range axonal projections from iMSNs, but also dMSNs in the NAc region specially, to the globus pallidum/ventral pallidum (Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011Gerfen C.R.

Previous studies provided functional evidence that these two pathways exert opposing effects on basal ganglia-mediated behaviors. Activation of the direct pathway facilitates locomotion, reward, and reinforcement, while activation of the indirect pathway suppresses these behaviors (Freeze et al., 2013Freeze B.S. Kravitz A.V.

It has been assumed that the long-range connectivity is mainly responsible for this functionally dichotomy. However, in addition to the long-range projections, MSNs extend short-range axonal projections within the striatum to form an extensive collateral plexus. The collateral transmission remains an underappreciated aspect of the striatal circuit and its contribution to regulating the behavioral output of the basal ganglia is unclear. Initial reports of the anatomical evidence for collateral transmission between MSNs in the dorsal striatum and the NAc appeared decades ago (Chang and Kitai, 1986Chang H.T. Kitai S.T.

However, the electrophysiological confirmation of functional inhibitory synapses between MSNs has only recently been shown (Lalchandani et al., 2013Lalchandani R.R. van der Goes M.S. Partridge J.G.

Inhibitory interactions between spiny projection neurons in the rat striatum.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 1263-1269PubMed Google Scholar). Using paired recordings of unidentified MSNs, the rate of connectivity was found to be variable and low (10%–25%). This is likely explained by the highly asymmetrical connectivity observed between the two subclasses of MSNs (Taverna et al., 2008Taverna S. Ilijic E. Surmeier D.J. Recurrent collateral connections of striatal medium spiny neurons are disrupted in models of Parkinson’s disease.J.

Each iMSN forms functional synapses with approximately one-third of neighboring dMSNs (iMSN→dMSN) and one-third of neighboring iMSNs (iMSN→iMSN), while dMSN collateral connectivity is mainly restricted to other dMSNs and rarely observed with iMSNs (Taverna et al., 2008Taverna S.

Differential dopaminergic modulation of neostriatal synaptic connections of striatopallidal axon collaterals.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8977-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Further, it was estimated that each iMSN makes only a few GABA synapses (2–5) with their target neurons (Taverna et al., 2008Taverna S. Ilijic E. Surmeier D.J. Recurrent collateral connections of striatal medium spiny neurons are disrupted in models of Parkinson’s disease.J.

Thus, the functional relevance of this lateral inhibition to striatal output was considered to be minimal, relative to feedforward inhibition from local interneurons, and has been largely overlooked. Here, we use optogenetic stimulation to synchronously activate the widespread collateral plexus from iMSNs in order to test its effect on the excitability of neighboring dMSNs and its modulation by dopamine (DA) and cocaine. Cocaine is an addictive stimulant drug that induces transient increases in locomotion in humans and other mammal species (Julien, 2001Julien R.M. A Primer of Drug Action: A Concise Nontechnical Guide to the Actions, Uses, and side Effects of Psychoactive Drugs.Ninth Edition. Worth Publishers, 2001Google Scholar). The mechanisms that mediate the locomotor response are not well understood, despite this being one of the most well-characterized cocaine behavioral responses. It is known that cocaine is a high-affinity blocker of the monoamine transporters, including the DA transporter, and that acute administration of cocaine causes a rapid increase in DA concentration in the NAc, which is reliably observed both in vivo and in vitro within minutes following drug administration (Adrover et al., 2014Adrover M.F.

There is solid evidence that the DA increase in the NAc is required for the cocaine-induced locomotion (Kelly and Iversen, 1976Kelly P.H. Iversen S.D.

DA Gi-coupled D2Rs are mainly expressed in iMSNs and are considered critical for cocaine-induced locomotion (Kita et al., 1999Kita K. Shiratani T. Takenouchi K. Fukuzako H. Takigawa M.

D2R activation in iMSNs produces well-described changes in intracellular signaling, biochemical pathway, and gene expression (Girault and Greengard, 2004Girault J.A. Greengard P.

Adding to the complexity is the diverse expression pattern of D2Rs in the striatum, which has limited the interpretation of experiments relying on pharmacology to characterize the effect of D2R activation in iMSNs because D2Rs are also expressed in cholinergic interneurons (Maurice et al., 2004Maurice N.

This study takes advantage of a recently developed mouse model with targeted deletion of D2Rs to iMSNs to uncover a novel synaptic mechanism through which cocaine, and dopamine, regulates intra-striatal connectivity to facilitate locomotion. Adora2a-Cre mice were used in this study to target iMSNs. Cre-positive neurons in these mice show >80% co-localization with met-enkephalin, another iMSNs marker, and form projection patterns that are consistent with the indirect pathway (Figure S1; Supplemental Experimental Procedures) (Lemos et al., 2016Lemos J.C.

Channelrodopsin-2 (ChR2) tagged with a fluorophore was expressed in iMSNs in the NAc using stereotaxic injection of a Cre-dependent viral vector (Figure 1A). This approach allows for selective stimulation of axonal collaterals from iMSNs within the NAc region in order to evaluate the efficacy of the lateral inhibition in regulating the excitability of neighboring MSNs. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were performed from MSNs that were negative for ChR2 and are defined here as putative dMSNs (see Experimental Procedures for details). Current steps were delivered to the putative dMSNs to elicit action potentials (APs) in the presence and absence of optogenetic stimulation of collateral transmission (Figures 1B and 1C). Before stimulation (laser OFF), each current step (267 ± 18 pA, 800 ms) elicited 10.5 ± 1 APs with a mean latency to fire the first AP of 198 ± 29 ms (n = 6). Optogenetic stimulation (laser ON, 20 pulses of 1–5 ms duration at 16 Hz) applied concurrently with the current step significantly decreased AP firing to 6.8 ± 1 APs (36% ± 5%; 2WRM ANOVA; drug × laser: F1,5 = 21.66, p < 0.01; post hoc: p < 0.01 ON versus OFF at baseline) and increased the latency to 239 ± 33 ms (24% ± 8%; 2WRM ANOVA drug × laser: F1,5 = 13.25, p < 0.05; post hoc: p < 0.05 ON versus OFF at baseline). Application of the GABAA receptor blocker gabazine (5 μM) increased the number of APs evoked by the current step and decreased the latency during laser OFF, revealing a tonic GABAA-mediated inhibition of AP firing under baseline conditions (APs: from 10.5 ± 1 to 14 ± 1.3; latency: from 198 ± 9 to 157 ± 21 ms after gabazine; post hoc: APs: p < 0.01; latency: p < 0.05 baseline versus gabazine during OFF; Figure 1D). Importantly, gabazine blocked the optical inhibition of AP firing and blocked the increase in latency induced by optogenetic stimulation of iMSNs (post hoc: APs: p < 0.0001; latency: p < 0.0001 baseline versus gabazine during ON). The GABAA receptor antagonist abolished the collateral inhibition (from 35.5% ± 4.7% to −2.1% ± 5.2%; paired t test: t5 = 6.4, p < 0.01; Figure 1E), demonstrating that GABAergic transmission and GABAA receptor activation are required for the inhibition of dMSN excitability by iMSN stimulation. Altogether, these results show that inhibitory GABAergic collateral transmission by iMSNs can inhibit dMSN excitability. Direct measurement of iMSN→dMSN short-range collateral GABA transmission was performed in voltage-clamp recordings from dMSNs in the NAc core (Figure 2A). Optogenetic stimulation of iMSNs reliably evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (oIPSCs) in neighboring putative dMSNs, which were blocked by 5 μM gabazine (97% ± 0.4% inhibition, n = 37). In agreement with previous reports (Lalchandani et al., 2013Lalchandani R.R. van der Goes M.S. Partridge J.G. Vicini S. Dopamine D2 receptors regulate collateral inhibition between striatal medium spiny neurons.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 14075-14086Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, Tecuapetla et al., 2009Tecuapetla F. Koós T. Tepper J.M. Kabbani N. Yeckel M.F. Differential dopaminergic modulation of neostriatal synaptic connections of striatopallidal axon collaterals.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8977-8990Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the D2-like agonist quinpirole (1 μM) inhibited oIPSC amplitude by 59% ± 6% (n = 6; Figures 2B–2D). Quinpirole showed a trend to increase the paired-pulse ratio (baseline: 1.1 ± 0.1, quinpirole: 1.7 ± 0.3; paired t test, t5 = 2.17, p = 0.08), which was reversed by sulpiride (1.1 ± 0.1), suggesting that quinpirole’s actions are mediated by presynaptic mechanisms that could involve inhibition of GABA release. In parallel experiments under the same conditions, we tested the effect of quinpirole on long-range axonal projections to the VP (iMSN→VP synapses). Optogenetic stimulation of iMSN fibers reliably evoked gabazine-sensitive oIPSCs in VP neurons. Quinpirole inhibition was less reliable and smaller in VP neurons compared to dMSNs in the NAc (19% ± 4%, n = 11). Sulpiride reversed the quinpirole inhibition in VP and dMSNs (1 μM; VP: −3% ± 7%; dMSNs: 10% ± 8%). Conversely, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (1–5 μM) potently inhibited oIPSC amplitude to a similar extent in dMSNs and VP neurons (62% ± 2% and 73% ± 8% for dMSNs and VP, respectively; n = 6–8; 2WRM ANOVA; site × drug: F1,12 = 5.31, p < 0.05; post hoc: p = NS; Figures 2C and 2E). Thus, while modulation by Gi-coupled GABAB receptors is similar at both terminals, the magnitude of the D2-like agonist inhibition was significantly greater in short-range collaterals than long-range projections to the VP (2WRM ANOVA; site × drug: F1,15 = 6.33, p < 0.05; post hoc: p < 0.001, VP versus dMSNs in quinpirole). These results indicate differential inhibition by a GABAA antagonist and a D2-like receptor on oIPSC amplitude in the VP. While surprising, these results are consistent with the relatively weak DA fiber innervation of the VP compared to the dense innervation of the NAc from midbrain DA neurons (fluorescent fiber density: 67 ± 4.6 and 31 ± 3.5 a.u. for NAc core and VP, respectively; paired t test: t4 = 13.8, p < 0.001, n = 5; Figures 2F and 2G). Quinpirole’s effects on the intrinsic excitability of iMSNs could contribute to the inhibition of synaptic transmission and account for its greater efficacy at short-range collaterals versus long-range projections. Using cell-attached recordings and in the presence of synaptic transmission blockers, we tested the effect of quinpirole on the intrinsic excitability of iMSNs by eliciting APs via optogenetic stimulation at different frequencies and under similar conditions as the oIPSC recordings (Figure 3A). The minimum light pulse duration to elicit 100% fidelity in AP firing was used and delivered at 4 and 16 Hz (4 Hz: 20.1 ± 0.03 APs; 16 Hz: 20 ± 0 APs, n = 8; Figures 3A–3C). Neither quinpirole (1 μM) nor sulpiride (1 μM) affected AP firing at either frequency (2WRM ANOVA: p values = NS, n = 5–8), indicating that quinpirole inhibits synaptic collateral GABA transmission downstream of changes in iMSNs excitability. D2-like receptor agonists have poor selectivity between D2Rs and D3Rs, which are both expressed in the NAc. Moreover, due to the complex expression pattern of D2Rs, it is extremely difficult to determine where the D2Rs implicated in this modulation are expressed. To determine whether D2Rs expressed specifically in iMSNs mediate the quinpirole regulation of collateral transmission, we took advantage of a mouse line with a targeted deletion of D2Rs from iMSNs (iMSN-Drd2KO mice; Lemos et al., 2016Lemos J.C. Friend D.M. Kaplan A.R. Shin J.H. Rubinstein M. Kravitz A.V. Alvarez V.A. Striatal D2 receptors constrain local inhibitory transmission to set in vivo firing and spontaneous basal movement.Neuron. 2016; (Published online May 18, 2016)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.04.040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In iMSN-Drd2KO mice, quinpirole did not inhibit oIPSC amplitude (2% ± 6%, n = 11; Figures 3D and 3E). This was in contrast to the robust quinpirole-mediated inhibition of oIPSC amplitude in Adora2a-Cre controls (53% ± 7%; n = 9; 2WRM ANOVA; genotype × quinpirole: F1,18 = 30.86, p < 0.0001, post hoc: Adora2a-Cre: p < 0.0001, iMSN-Drd2KO: p = NS, baseline versus quinpirole). Conversely, baclofen inhibited oIPSC amplitude by 52% ± 6% in iMSN-Drd2KO mice, which was similar to the baclofen effect Adora2a-Cre mice (n = 13; 2WRM ANOVA; baclofen: F1,22 = 257, p < 0.0001). These experiments demonstrate that the loss of quinpirole inhibition is not due to a general disruption in Gi/o-mediated inhibition of GABA release from these terminals and that D2Rs in iMSNs, possibly localized to presynaptic terminals, are required for the suppression of iMSN→dMSN collateral transmission. We hypothesized that suppression of short range collateral transmission by D2Rs could disinhibit dMSNs and that this effect would be lost in iMSN-Drd2KO mice. These hypotheses were tested using a similar experimental configuration as in Figure 1. In control Adora2a-Cre mice, optogenetic stimulation of iMSN→dMSN collateral transmission inhibited dMSN firing by 46% ± 7% (OFF: 10.4 ± 0.8 APs; ON: 5.9 ± 0.9 APs, n = 11; 2WRM ANOVA; laser: F1,11 = 30.36, p < 0.001; Figures 3F and 3G). In the presence of quinpirole, the optogenetic-mediated inhibition of firing was significantly reduced to 26% ± 8% (paired t test: t11 = 4.01, p < 0.01; OFF: 9.8 ± 1 APs and ON: 7.4 ± 1.1 APs; n = 12; 2WRM ANOVA; laser × quinpirole: F1,11 = 11.46, p = 0.01; post hoc: p < 0.05 baseline ON versus quinpirole ON). Similarly, in iMSN-Drd2KO mice, optogenetic stimulation of iMSN→dMSN collateral transmission inhibited dMSN firing (36% ± 6%; OFF: 9.5 ± 1.2 APs; ON: 6 ± 1.1 APs, n = 11; 2WRM ANOVA; ON: F1,10 = 20.52, p = 0.01). In agreement with the lack of a quinpirole effect on oIPSC amplitude, quinpirole also did not affect the optogenetic-mediated inhibition of firing in iMSN-Drd2KO mice (34% ± 10%; paired t test: p = NS; OFF: 9.5 ± 1.2 APs and ON: 6.3 ± 1.1 APs; n = 11; no effect or interaction; Figures 3F and 3G).

Based on our findings, we hypothesized that cocaine would affect iMSN→dMSN collateral transmission. Indeed, cocaine (10 μM) inhibited oIPSC amplitude recorded in putative dMSNs by 40% ± 8% in control Adora2a-Cre mice (n = 6; 2WRM ANOVA; cocaine × genotype: F1,12 = 10.3, p < 0.01; post hoc: p < 0.01 baseline versus cocaine; Figures 4A and 4B ). Interestingly, cocaine had no effect on oIPSCs in iMSN-Drd2KO mice (0.2% ± 10% inhibition; n = 8; p = NS), indicating that D2Rs in iMSNs mediate the cocaine suppression of iMSN→dMSN collateral transmission. In experiments similar to those performed with quinpirole, cocaine suppressed lateral inhibition and enhanced the excitability of dMSNs. Optogenetic stimulation of iMSNs significantly inhibited dMSN baseline firing from 13."

Such behavioral adaptation may be facilitated by neurons coding prediction errors relative to the standard deviation (SD) of reward distributions. To investigate this hypothesis, we required participants to predict the magnitude of upcoming reward drawn from distributions with different SDs. After each prediction, participants received a reward, yielding trial-by-trial prediction errors. In line with the notion of adaptive coding, BOLD response slopes in the Substantia Nigra/Ventral Tegmental Area (SN/VTA) and ventral striatum were steeper for prediction errors occurring in distributions with smaller SDs. SN/VTA adaptation was not instantaneous but developed across trials. Adaptive prediction error coding was paralleled by behavioral adaptation, as reflected by SD-dependent changes in learning rate. Crucially, increased SN/VTA and ventral striatal adaptation was related to improved task performance. These results suggest that adaptive coding facilitates behavioral adaptation and supports efficient learning."

Here we provide evidence for the maintenance of a gradient of increasing CCL8 concentration between the epithelium, the stroma and the periphery that is instrumental for breast cancer cells’ dissemination. In response to signals elicited by the neoplastic epithelium, CCL8 production is enhanced in stromal fibroblasts at the tumor margins and in tissues at which breast cancer cells tend to metastasize such as the lungs and the brain. Manipulation of CCL8 activity influences the histology of the tumors and promotes major steps of the metastatic process such as invasion to adjacent stroma, intravasation and ultimately extravasation and seeding. These findings exemplify how gradients of chemoattractive factors such as CCL8, drive metastasis and suggest that interference with their operation may provide means for breast cancer management."
https://openalex.org/W2368411760,"Radiation therapy is a staple approach for cancer treatment, whereas radioresistance of cancer cells remains a substantial clinical problem. In response to ionizing radiation (IR) induced DNA damage, cancer cells can sustain/activate pro-survival signaling pathways, leading to apoptotic resistance and induction of cell cycle checkpoint/DNA repair. Previous studies show that Rac1 GTPase is overexpressed/hyperactivated in breast cancer cells and is associated with poor prognosis. Studies from our laboratory reveal that Rac1 activity is necessary for G2/M checkpoint activation and cell survival in response to IR exposure of breast and pancreatic cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of Rac1 on the survival of breast cancer cells treated with hyper-fractionated radiation (HFR), which is used clinically for cancer treatment. Results in this report indicate that Rac1 protein expression is increased in the breast cancer cells that survived HFR compared with parental cells. Furthermore, this increase of Rac1 is associated with enhanced activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathways and increased levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, which are downstream targets of ERK1/2 and NF-κB signaling pathways. Using Rac1-specific inhibitor and dominant-negative mutant N17Rac1, here we demonstrate that Rac1 inhibition decreases the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and inhibitory κBα (IκBα), as well as the levels of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 protein in the HFR-selected breast cancer cells. Moreover, inhibition of Rac1 using either small molecule inhibitor or dominant-negative N17Rac1 abrogates clonogenic survival of HFR-selected breast cancer cells and decreases the level of intact poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, which is indicative of apoptosis induction. Collectively, results in this report suggest that Rac1 signaling is essential for the survival of breast cancer cells subjected to HFR and implicate Rac1 in radioresistance of breast cancer cells. These studies also provide the basis to explore Rac1 as a therapeutic target for radioresistant breast cancer cells."

Subjects and Methods We randomized 100 patients with chronic systolic HF (NYHA Class 1–3, ejection fraction≤40%) to a 12-week group TC program or an education control. At 12-weeks, semi-structured interviews were conducted on a random subset (n = 32; n = 17 in TC, n = 15 in control), audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Two independent reviewers extracted information using grounded-theory methods for emergent themes. We explored similarities and differences in themes/sub-themes between the groups, and examined qualitative association with changes from baseline to post-intervention in previously reported quantitative measures (e.g., Minnesota Living with HF, Cardiac Exercise Self Efficacy and Profile of Mood States). Results The mean age (±SD) of participants was 68±9 years, baseline ejection fraction 29±7%, and median New York Heart Association class 2 HF. We idenitifed themes related to the patient’s experience of illness, perceptions of self, and relationship to others. Specific psychosocial and physical benefits were described. Common themes emerged from both groups including: social support and self-efficacy related to activity/exercise and diet. The tai chi group, however, also exhibited a more global empowerment and perceived control. Additional themes in TC included mindfulness/self-awareness, decreased stress reactivity, and renewed social role. These themes mirrored improvements in previously reported quantitative measures (quality-of-life, self-efficacy, and mood) in TC compared to control. Patients in TC also reported physical benefits (e.g., decreased pain, improved energy, endurance, flexibility). Conclusion Positive themes emerged from both groups, although there were qualitative differences in concepts of self-efficacy and perceived control between groups. Those in tai chi reported not only self efficacy and social support, but overall empowerment with additional gains such as internal locus of control, self-awareness and stress management. Future studies of mind-body exercise might further examine perceived control, self-efficacy, and locus-of-control as potential mediators of effect."
https://openalex.org/W2381312249,"While there is growing interest in understanding how marine life will respond to future ocean acidification, many coastal ecosystems currently experience intense acidification in response to upwelling, eutrophication, or riverine discharge. Such acidification can be inhibitory to calcifying animals, but less is known regarding how non-calcifying macroalgae may respond to elevated CO2. Here, we report on experiments performed during summer through fall with North Atlantic populations of Gracilaria and Ulva that were grown in situ within a mesotrophic estuary (Shinnecock Bay, NY, USA) or exposed to normal and elevated, but environmentally realistic, levels of pCO2 and/or nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus). In nearly all experiments, the growth rates of Gracilaria were significantly increased by an average of 70% beyond in situ and control conditions when exposed to elevated levels of pCO2 (p<0.05), but were unaffected by nutrient enrichment. In contrast, the growth response of Ulva was more complex as this alga experienced significantly (p<0.05) increased growth rates in response to both elevated pCO2 and elevated nutrients and, in two cases, pCO2 and nutrients interacted to provide a synergistically enhanced growth rate for Ulva. Across all experiments, elevated pCO2 significantly increased Ulva growth rates by 30% (p<0.05), while the response to nutrients was smaller (p>0.05). The δ13C content of both Gracilaria and Ulva decreased two-to-three fold when grown under elevated pCO2 (p<0.001) and mixing models demonstrated these macroalgae experienced a physiological shift from near exclusive use of HCO3- to primarily CO2 use when exposed to elevated pCO2. This shift in carbon use coupled with significantly increased growth in response to elevated pCO2 suggests that photosynthesis of these algae was limited by their inorganic carbon supply. Given that eutrophication can yield elevated levels of pCO2, this study suggests that the overgrowth of macroalgae in eutrophic estuaries can be directly promoted by acidification, a process that will intensify in the coming decades."
https://openalex.org/W2356114315,"Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is essential for activation of NADPH oxidase type 2 (NOX2) in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs), alveolar macrophages (AMs), and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Angiotensin II and phorbol ester increased superoxide/H2O2 generation in PMVECs, AMs, and isolated lungs from wild-type (WT) mice, but had much less effect on cells or lungs from Prdx6-null or Prdx6-D140A-knock-in mice that lack the phospholipase A2 activity (PLA2) of Prdx6; addition of either lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) or lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to cells restored their oxidant generation. The generation of LPC by PMVECs required Prdx6-PLA2. We propose that Prdx6-PLA2 modulates NOX2 activation by generation of LPC that is converted to LPA by the lysophospholipase D activity of autotaxin (ATX/lysoPLD). Inhibition of lysoPLD with HA130 (cells,10 μM; lungs, 20 μM; IC50, 29 nM) decreased agonist-induced oxidant generation. LPA stimulates pathways regulated by small GTPases through binding to G-protein-coupled LPA receptors (LPARs). The LPAR blocker Ki16425 (cells, 10 μM; lungs, 25 μM; Ki, 0.34 μM) or cellular knockdown of LPAR type 1 decreased oxidant generation and blocked translocation of racl to plasma membrane. Thus, Prdx6-PLA2 modulates NOX2 activation through generation of LPC for conversion to LPA; binding of LPA to LPAR1 signals rac activation.—Vázquez-Medina, J.

Motor cortical circuits have been hypothesized to provide execution errors that drive adaptation, but human imaging studies to date have reported that execution errors are encoded in parietal association areas. Thus, little evidence has been uncovered that supports the motor hypothesis. Here, we show that both primary motor and premotor cortices encode information on end-point errors in reaching. We further show that post-movement microstimulation to these regions caused trial-by-trial increases in errors, which subsided exponentially when the stimulation was terminated. The results indicate for the first time that motor cortical circuits provide error signals that drive trial-by-trial adaptation in reaching movements."
https://openalex.org/W2350378223,"Melanopsin photopigment expressed in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) plays a crucial role in the adaptation of mammals to their ambient light environment through both image-forming and non-image-forming visual responses. The ipRGCs are structurally and functionally distinct from classical rod/cone photoreceptors and have unique properties, including single-photon response, long response latency, photon integration over time, and slow deactivation. We discovered that amino acid sequence features of melanopsin protein contribute to the functional properties of the ipRGCs. Phosphorylation of a cluster of Ser/Thr residues in the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of melanopsin contributes to deactivation, which in turn determines response latency and threshold sensitivity of the ipRGCs. The poorly conserved region distal to the phosphorylation cluster inhibits phosphorylation’s functional role, thereby constituting a unique delayed deactivation mechanism. Concerted action of both regions sustains responses to dim light, allows for the integration of light over time, and results in precise signal duration."
https://openalex.org/W2405887793,"Hyperphosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been found in various types of human cancers, including head and neck cancer (HNC). Although smoking is critical in the development and progression of HNC, how tobacco components activate STAT3 is unclear. We demonstrated that exposure of HNC cell lines to a tobacco extract induced a rapid Y705 phosphorylation of STAT3 and a rapid increase in the SUMO protease SENP3 that depended on a simultaneous increase in reactive oxygen species. We identified that SUMOylation at the lysine 451 site facilitated STAT3 binding to the phosphatase TC45 through an SUMO-interacting motif of TC45. SENP3 could thus enhance STAT3 phosphorylation by de-conjugating the SUMO2/3 modification of STAT3. Knocking-down of SENP3 greatly impaired basal and induced STAT3 phosphorylation by tobacco extract or interleukin 6. A correlation between SENP3 protein levels and STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation levels in human laryngeal carcinoma specimens was found, which was more significant in the specimens derived from the smoker patients and with poor clinicopathological parameters. Our data identified SUMOylation as a previously undescribed post-translational modification of STAT3 and SENP3 as a critical positive modulator of tobacco- or cytokine-induced STAT3 activation. These findings provide novel insights into the hyperphosphorylation of STAT3 in development of HNC."

Here, we used the revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale (HDS-R) to identify suspected MCI in elderly individuals. We then analyzed written and spoken narratives to compare the language abilities between study participants with and without MCI in order to explore the relationship between cognitive and language abilities, and to identify a possible indicator for the early detection of MCI and dementia. We recruited 22 people aged 74 to 86 years (mean: 78.32 years; standard deviation: 3.36). The participants were requested to write and talk about one of the happiest events in their lives. Based on HDS-R scores, we divided the participants into 2 groups: the MCI Group comprised 8 participants with a score of 26 or lower, while the Healthy Group comprised 14 participants with a score of 27 or higher. The transcriptions of both written and spoken samples for each participant were used in the measurement of NLP-based language ability scores. Our analysis showed no significant differences in writing abilities between the 2 groups in any of the language ability scores. However, analysis of the spoken narrative showed that the MCI Group had a significantly larger vocabulary size. In addition, analysis of a metric that signified the gap in content between the spoken and written narratives also revealed a larger vocabulary size in the MCI Group. Individuals with early-stage MCI may be engaging in behavior to conceal their deteriorating cognition, thereby leading to a temporary increase in their active spoken vocabulary. These results indicate the possible detection of early stages of reduced cognition before dementia onset through the analysis of spoken narratives."
https://openalex.org/W2368171691,"A photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensor with excellent sensitivity and detection toward copper (II) ions (Cu2+) was developed using a cadmium sulphide-reduced graphene oxide (CdS-rGO) nanocomposite on an indium tin oxide (ITO) surface, with triethanolamine (TEA) used as the sacrificial electron donor. The CdS nanoparticles were initially synthesized via the aerosol-assisted chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) method using cadmium acetate and thiourea as the precursors to Cd2+ and S2-, respectively. Graphene oxide (GO) was then dip-coated onto the CdS electrode and sintered under an argon gas flow (50 mL/min) for the reduction process. The nanostructured CdS was adhered securely to the ITO by a continuous network of rGO that also acted as an avenue to intensify the transfer of electrons from the conduction band of CdS. The photoelectrochemical results indicated that the ITO/CdS-rGO photoelectrode could facilitate broad UV-visible light absorption, which would lead to a higher and steady-state photocurrent response in the presence of TEA in 0.1 M KCl. The photocurrent decreased with an increase in the concentration of Cu2+ ions. The photoelectrode response for Cu2+ ion detection had a linear range of 0.5–120 μM, with a limit of detection (LoD) of 16 nM. The proposed PEC sensor displayed ultra-sensitivity and good selectivity toward Cu2+ ion detection."

In addition to its role in tissue injury, the persistent presence of P. aeruginosa–secreted products may also affect epithelial repair ability, raising the need for new antivirulence therapies. The purpose of our study was to better understand the outcomes of P. aeruginosa exoproducts exposure on airway epithelial repair processes to identify a strategy to counteract their deleterious effect. We found that P. aeruginosa exoproducts significantly decreased wound healing, migration, and proliferation rates, and impaired the ability of directional migration of primary non–cystic fibrosis (CF) human airway epithelial cells. Impact of exoproducts was inhibited after mutations in P. aeruginosa genes that encoded for the quorum-sensing (QS) transcriptional regulator, LasR, and the elastase, LasB, whereas impact was restored by LasB induction in ΔlasR mutants. P. aeruginosa purified elastase also induced a significant decrease in non-CF epithelial repair, whereas protease inhibition with phosphoramidon prevented the effect of P. aeruginosa exoproducts. Furthermore, treatment of P. aeruginosa cultures with 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2H)furanone, a QS inhibitor, abrogated the negative impact of P. aeruginosa exoproducts on airway epithelial repair. Finally, we confirmed our findings in human airway epithelial cells from patients with CF, a disease featuring P. aeruginosa chronic respiratory infection.

Cell polarity is fundamental to the functioning of cells and involves the asymmetric distribution of cellular components and specialized plasma membrane domains.

A plethora of intrinsic and extrinsic polarity cues control the location of Cdc42 activation in cells. In their absence, Cdc42 can spontaneously break symmetry, which substantiates its key role in cell polarization (Wedlich-Soldner and Li, 2008Wedlich-Soldner R. Li R.

Localized Cdc42 activity directly or indirectly controls various sub-cellular processes, including cytoskeleton remodeling, membrane and protein trafficking, and cell type-specific functions, such as localized growth activation (Martin and Arkowitz, 2014Martin S.G. Arkowitz R.A. Cell polarization in budding and fission yeasts.FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2014; 38: 228-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In some cells, the polarized state is maintained via molecular barriers that separate specialized membrane domains from the rest of the plasma membrane. In this way, budding yeast cells insulate the non-growing mother from its growing daughter cell, which no longer requires polarity cues, thus enabling fast, isotropic growth (Faty et al., 2002Faty M. Fink M. Barral Y. Septins: a ring to part mother and daughter.Curr. Genet. 2002; 41: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, in epithelial cells molecular barriers separate the specialized, apical plasma membrane domain from the rest, and they ensure that in cytokinesis the daughter cells inherit this polarized state (Ragkousi and Gibson, 2014Ragkousi K. Gibson M.C. Cell division and the maintenance of epithelial order.J. Cell Biol. 2014; 207: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In contrast, migrating cells or growing tips of neuronal axons, need to flexibly adapt their polarization state. In these cells, external signals impose persistent directionality (Petrie et al., 2009Petrie R.J. Doyle A.D. Yamada K.M. Random versus directionally persistent cell migration.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 538-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar).

Its cylindrical cells use antiparallel MT bundles, aligned parallel to the long cell axis, to deposit the tea1p marker protein at both cell poles, which ensures accurate polar growth site positioning (Mata and Nurse, 1997Mata J.

Many of the cells carrying a tea1 deletion (tea1Δ) aberrantly position their growth sites, growing bent or branched. Common to all examples of MTs influencing cell polarity is the importance of MT interaction with the actin cytoskeleton (Akhshi et al., 2014Akhshi T.K. Wernike D. Piekny A.

In fission yeast, the SH3 domain-containing protein tea4p connects tea1p and the main F-actin-nucleating formin, for3p (Martin et al., 2005Martin S.G. McDonald W.H. Yates 3rd, J.R. Chang F. Tea4p links microtubule plus ends with the formin for3p in the establishment of cell polarity.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 479-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). tea4 deletion copies the tea1Δ phenotype, placing tea4p in the MT polarity pathway. However, for3 deletion does not cause abnormal growth site positioning (Feierbach and Chang, 2001Feierbach B. Chang F. Roles of the fission yeast formin for3p in cell polarity, actin cable formation and symmetric cell division.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1656-1665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The role of the tea1p/tea4p/for3p interaction thus remains unclear. Since only 35% of tea1Δ cells in an exponentially growing culture grow at aberrant positions, redundant polarity cues must exist (Mata and Nurse, 1997Mata J. Nurse P. tea1 and the microtubular cytoskeleton are important for generating global spatial order within the fission yeast cell.Cell. 1997; 89: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Polarity inheritance through cell division may provide an alternative polarity pathway (Abenza et al., 2014Abenza J.F. Chessel A. Raynaud W.G. Carazo-Salas R.E. Dynamics of cell shape inheritance in fission yeast.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e106959Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Such functional redundancy has so far hampered a comprehensive analysis of the tea1p polarity pathway. A further complication is the second phenotype associated with tea1 deletion: after cell division, wild-type daughter cells start growing exclusively at the old cell pole. Only after some time, they activate the new pole too, an event called new end take off (NETO). Tea1Δ cells cannot switch from monopolar to bipolar growth (Mata and Nurse, 1997Mata J. Nurse P. tea1 and the microtubular cytoskeleton are important for generating global spatial order within the fission yeast cell.Cell. 1997; 89: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Whether this function of tea1p is related to its role in growth site positioning is not clear (Huisman and Brunner, 2011Huisman S.M. Brunner D. Cell polarity in fission yeast: a matter of confining, positioning, and switching growth zones.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2011; 22: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To address these issues, we have established de novo cell polarization during starvation exit (SE) as an experimental system, in which polar growth positioning is fully tea1p-dependent. We identify sterol-rich membrane (SRM) domains as essential, core organizers of cell polarity that are modulated by tea1p. SRM domains in yeasts are thought to consist of clustered microdomains that are enriched in sterols and sphingolipids, similar to the specialized membrane domains often referred to as lipid rafts in higher eukaryotes (Klose et al., 2010Klose C. Ejsing C.S. García-Sáez A.J. Kaiser H.-J. Sampaio J.L. Surma M.A. Shevchenko A. Schwille P. Simons K. Yeast lipids can phase-separate into micrometer-scale membrane domains.J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Similar to lipid rafts, these microdomains were proposed to form and localize as a consequence of growth activity (Bagnat and Simons, 2002Bagnat M. Simons K.

Yeast lipid rafts?--an emerging view.Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We find that fission yeast cells in SE initially form multiple SRM domains at random positions in the plasma membrane, preceding growth and dependent on new sterol synthesis. In addition, SRM domain formation occurs independent of polarity cues or the cytoskeleton. These domains define prospective growth sites upon which polarity factors and the growth machinery accumulate. During the subsequent polarization step, the MT/tea1p system, which self-organizes independent of SRMs, is involved in the expansion and maintenance of polar SRM domains, while the actin cytoskeleton is required to remove the unwanted domains in the cell center. Consequently, the following growth activation can only occur at cell poles. In the absence of tea1p, any one of the pre-existing SRM domains can initiate growth and all other domains are eliminated. Depending on the position of the selected domain, cells grow branched, bent, or straight. The inability of tea1Δ cells to establish a second SRM domain during SRM polarization explains why these cells later cannot switch from monopolar to bipolar growth. Surprisingly, tea1p/SRM-dependent cell polarization occurs independent of cdc42p activity. Specialized membrane domains and their positioning by the cytoskeleton thus provide an alternative pathway to cdc42p-mediated cell polarization. So far, studies on cell polarity in fission yeast were mainly done in cycling cells, in which daughter cells can inherit polarity cues from their mother. To study cell polarization in the absence of polarity inheritance, we used fission yeast cells that establish cell polarity de novo during starvation exit (SE). For this, we added fresh growth medium to cells that had entered starvation after 2 days of culturing (Experimental Procedures). Such 2-day starved cells had arrested growth and had lost polarity, as suggested by the redistribution of actin patches (marked by crn1p-GFP), the absence of the bud6p and for3p polarity marker proteins at the cell poles, as well as the loss of polar, sterol-rich membrane (SRM) domains (Figures S1A and S1B) (Pelham and Chang, 2001Pelham Jr., R.J.

Sterol-rich plasma membrane domains in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 867-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We then followed the sequence of events that led to the localization of polarity markers and SRM domains in correlation with growth initiation. We followed SRM domain dynamics in individual cells using a new live marker, GFP-tagged tna1p (GFP-tna1p), which labels SRM domains in the plasma membrane. In addition, this transmembrane protein labels sub-cellular structures with erratic motility, most likely of vesicular origin (Figure S1C; Movie S1; Supplemental Information). GFP-tna1p co-localization with SRMs was always confirmed by counterstaining cell samples with the standardly used, non-vital fluorescent dye filipin that directly binds to sterols in the plasma membrane (Figures S1C and S1D; Movie S2; Experimental Procedures). Our analysis of SE revealed a linear cell and growth polarization process that we divided into four phases (P1–P4) based on the observed changes in SRM domain localization and growth (Figure 1A; Movie S3). To describe and quantify these changes, we developed automated image analysis software (Figure 1B; Supplemental Information). The first phase (P1) was defined by the appearance of multiple, randomly distributed SRM domains at the plasma membrane within 5–10 min of SE, in the absence of growth (Figures 1C–1F and S1E; Movie S3). In P1, filipin stained slightly larger plasma membrane domains than GFP-tna1p and some very small domains lacking GFP-tna1p (Figure 1F). This suggests that GFP-tna1p is sorted to SRMs with a delay. Similarly, the standard polarity markers, bud6p tagged with the fluorescent protein Tomato (bud6p-Tom) and actin patches visualized with crn1p-GFP, became enriched at most SRM domains, while only a few fluorescent particles remained outside these regions (Figure 1G) (Martin and Chang, 2006Martin S.G.

Role of actin polymerization and actin cables in actin-patch movement in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). One percent of cells had an extended P1 that lasted for several hours without detectable growth (Figure 1H). In these cells, some GFP-tna1p patches disappeared over time, and new patches formed at other locations. Altogether, this suggests that SRMs are dynamic platforms on which components of the growth and polarity machinery assemble prior to growth initiation. The second phase of SE (P2) started within ∼30 min after nutrient addition, when SRMs began reorganizing to become confined to the two cell poles (Figures 1D, 1I, and S2A; Movie S3; Table S1A). This polarization event involved the expansion of SRM domains at cell poles and rapid disappearance of the centrally located domains. Eventually, SRM “caps” covered both cell poles. During SRM polarization, slow growth (below 0.8 μm/hr) became detectable at many cell poles (Figure 1J; Supplemental Information). In exponentially growing cells, similar slow growth was observed prior to NETO, when cells switch to bipolar growth (Mitchison and Nurse, 1985Mitchison J.M. Nurse P. Growth in cell length in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 357-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In parallel to SRM polarization, the polarity markers bud6p-Tom and crn1p-GFP disappeared from central cell regions and became concentrated at both cell poles (Figure 1K). The third phase of SE (P3) began with marked growth acceleration at one cell pole, which we termed the “primary pole” (Figure 1J). P3 started ∼30 min after the onset of P2, when the SRM cap at the primary pole had expanded to an average width of 4.6 μm (Tables S1A and S1B). Thereafter, growth speeds and SRM domain width showed clear correlation (Figure S1F). Notably, 41% of the cells (n = 275) entered P3 before centrally located SRM patches had fully disappeared. We measured growth speeds of up to 3 μm/hr for individual cell ends (Figure S3A). During P3, the second cell pole, which we termed “secondary pole,” continued showing slow growth. Thirty-four percent of the cells observed until the first cell division entered a fourth phase, P4 (Table S1C). P4 was defined by growth acceleration also at the secondary pole (Figures 1I and 1J). This switch from monopolar fast growth to bipolar fast growth most likely corresponds to NETO in exponentially growing cells, although, due to the lack of previous division history, we could not distinguish old and new ends in cells exiting starvation. Fifteen percent of the cells exiting starvation paused growth during P2, P3, or P4. Growth arrest coincided with SRM depolarization and re-organization into randomly positioned domains as observed in P1 (Figure 1L). Such cells resumed growth within about 130 min, following the aforementioned P2-to-P3 sequence of events. Interestingly, 91% of these cells changed their growth pattern after pausing (Table S2A). To confirm that the described sequence of polarization events occurs also in cells exiting deeper starvation, which is characterized by the lack of MTs and polar tea1p (Figure S1G), we analyzed SE of 5-day starved cells, which are considerably less viable than 2-day starved cells. The first detectable reaction to nutrient addition in surviving cells was MT reappearance and resumption of tea1p delivery to the cell poles (Figure S1H). At this stage, 5-day starved cells were comparable to 2-day starved cells, which still contained functional MTs at the onset of SE. Thereafter, 5-day starved cells showed the same sequence of events with respect to SRM domain formation and growth initiation as 2-day starved cells, except for a short delay in P1 initiation (data not shown). To investigate the requirement of SRMs in cell polarization, we prevented sterol production by treating starved cells with ketoconazole, which blocks the first step of ergosterol synthesis from lanosterol (Van den Bossche et al., 1980Van den Bossche H. Willemsens G. Cools W. Cornelissen F. Lauwers W.F. van Cutsem J.M. In vitro and in vivo effects of the antimycotic drug ketoconazole on sterol synthesis.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1980; 17: 922-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) (Experimental Procedures). In cells exiting starvation in the presence of ketoconazole, filipin stained some domains at the plasma membrane, but the signal was very faint compared to untreated cells (Figure 2A). GFP-tna1p remained trapped in the subcellular structures and did not localize to the plasma membrane even after several hours of imaging (Figure 2B). This suggests that the bulk of sterols forming the multiple SRM domains in P1 is produced de novo, and starved cells can only release small quantities of sterols to the plasma membrane during SE. While polar tea1p deposition by the MTs was not affected, ketoconazole-treated cells did not show any signs of polarization or growth initiation. Even after several hours, neither filipin nor GFP-tna1p or the polarity markers bud6p-Tom and crn1p-GFP localized to the cell poles (Figures 2B and 2C). Monitoring ergosterol levels by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) revealed an ergosterol pool in starved cells, which strongly increased during SE (Figure 2D; Experimental Procedures). This was prevented in ketoconazole-treated cells, where the initial ergosterol level dropped, indicating that the preexisting ergosterol pool may be lost during SE. Overnight ketoconazole treatment caused cell death. Two-hour drug treatment, however, did not affect cell viability, and ketoconazole washout from such cells, after a short delay, resulted in SRM domain formation, cell polarization, and growth initiation, in the same order and with similar timing as in untreated cells (Figure 2E; Table S2B). We conclude that new sterol synthesis and SRM domain formation are prerequisites for cell polarization and growth initiation during SE. Our attempts to genetically interfere with SRM domain formation were unsuccessful as deletion of erg1, encoding an enzyme acting early in the sterol-synthesis pathway, or of lcb1, which is required for the synthesis of sphingolipids, another suspected core component of SRM domains, resulted in cell death (Sütterlin et al., 1997Sütterlin C. Doering T.L. Schimmöller F. Schröder S. Riezman H. Specific requirements for the ER to Golgi transport of GPI-anchored proteins in yeast.J.

Combined overexpression of genes of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway leads to accumulation of sterols in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.FEMS Yeast Res. 2003; 4: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). MTs are known to contribute to cell polarization by depositing tea1p at the cell poles, which ensures accurate growth site positioning (Mata and Nurse, 1997Mata J. Nurse P. tea1 and the microtubular cytoskeleton are important for generating global spatial order within the fission yeast cell.Cell. 1997; 89: 939-949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To test the role of the MT/tea1p system in cell polarization, we followed SRM behavior and cell growth during SE in tea1-deleted (tea1Δ) cells (Movie S4). Tea1Δ cells entered P1 and formed randomly distributed SRM domains at the plasma membrane similar to wild-type cells (Figures 3A and S2B). However, progression into P2 was severely delayed and virtually coincided with P3 initiation, as SRM domain expansion and fast growth initiation started almost simultaneously at a single position (Figure 3B; Table S2B). Importantly, growth was initiated at any of the SRM domains that had formed during P1. Consequently, 76% of the cells grew branched, initiating growth at a lateral SRM domain, another 22% grew bent, initiating growth near an existing pole, and only 2% grew straight (Figures 3A, S2B, and S2C; Table S3A). We conclude that tea1p controls de novo cell polarization by promoting polar SRM stabilization during P2 and by providing a growth initiation bias to one of the polar SRM domains during P3. Another striking phenotype of tea1Δ cells was their inability to establish and maintain SRM domains at non-growing cell poles (Figures 3A and S2B; Table S3B). This suggests that in the wild-type, tea1p is responsible for the formation and maintenance of SRM domains at secondary poles prior to growth initiation. Considering that SRM domains seem to define prospective growth sites, this provides an explanation for why tea1Δ cells cannot activate a second growth site. Notably, new GFP-tna1p patches appeared away from the existing growth site in tea1Δ cells later in P3 (Figures 3A and S2B). However, these SRM domains were diffuse and did not show detectable growth activity. We observed a very similar SRM domain behavior in exponentially growing tea1Δ cells (Figure S2D). In summary, our results suggest that the MT/tea1p system positions growth sites and enables switching from monopolar to bipolar growth by controlling SRM domain position, stability, and growth activation potential. Interestingly, after fast growth initiation the average cell end growth speed of tea1Δ cells was higher than that of wild-type cells (Figure S3E). Together with the previous finding that cell ends in tea1Δ cells are on average larger (Foethke et al., 2009Foethke D. Makushok T. Brunner D. Nédélec F. Force- and length-dependent catastrophe activities explain interphase microtubule organization in fission yeast.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 241Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), this hints at a rate-limiting activity in the growth machinery, which distributes between two SRM domains in the wild-type and concentrates at one in tea1Δ cells. The main phenotypes displayed by tea1Δ cells were also observed during SE of cells in which MT length and dynamics were reduced either by mal3 or tip1 gene deletion, or by treating wild-type cells with the MT depolymerizing drug MBC (Figures S4A–S4D; Table S3A; Experimental Procedures) (Beinhauer et al., 1997Beinhauer J.D. Hagan I.M. Hegemann J.H. Fleig U. Mal3, the fission yeast homologue of the human APC-interacting protein EB-1 is required for microtubule integrity and the maintenance of cell form.J.

However, phenotypic penetrance was much reduced in these cells, indicating that the MT system merely optimizes tea1p activity. Similar to tea1Δ cells, tea4-deleted (tea4Δ) cells in exponential growth can grow bent or branched. Furthermore, tea4p was shown to bind tea1p directly (Martin et al., 2005Martin S.G. McDonald W.H.

They have been affected by powdery mildew caused by Erysiphe alphitoides for more than a century. This fungus is a biotrophic foliar pathogen that diverts photosynthetate from the plant for its own nutrition. We used a dendrochronological approach to investigate the effects of different levels of infection severity on the radial growth of young oak trees. Oak infection was monitored at individual tree level, at two sites in southwestern France, over a five-year period (2001-2005). Mean infection severity was almost 75% (infected leaf area) at the end of the 2001 growing season, at both sites, but only about 40% in 2002, and 8%, 5% and 2% in 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Infection levels varied considerably between trees and were positively related between 2001 and 2002. Increment cores were taken from each tree to assess annual ring widths and increases in basal area. Annual radial growth was standardised to take the effect of tree size into account. Annual standardised radial growth was significantly and negatively correlated with infection severity in the same year, for both 2001 and 2002, and at both sites. The decrease in growth reached 70-90% for highly infected trees. The earlywood width was poorly correlated with infection severity, but the proportion of latewood in tree rings was lower in highly infected trees (60%) than in less heavily infected trees (85%). Infection in 2001 and 2002 was found to have a cumulative effect on radial growth in these years, together with a delayed effect detectable in 2003. Thus, even non-lethal pathogens like powdery mildew can have a significant impact on tree functioning. This impact should be taken into account in growth and yield models, to improve predictions of forest net primary production."
https://openalex.org/W2354402156,"To investigate and analyze prevalence and risk factors of infertility at a representative rural site of Northern China.This is a cross-sectional study. We conducted a face-to-face questionnaire survey from July 2014 to October 2014 involving 5,131 women who were at childbearing age in Suizhong, a medium-sized, representative county located in Northern China. Finally, data from 4,232 valid questionnaires were analyzed.Infertility is defined as the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regularly unprotected sexual intercourse.Infertility prevalence in Suizhong County was 13.09% (95% CI, 12.09%-14.1%), of which the primary infertility incidence was 0.99% (95% CI, 0.72%-1.34%), and the secondary infertility incidence was 12.10% (95% CI, 11.13%-13.12%). For women, the infertility incidence of underweight women (Body Mass Index, BMI<18.5 kg/m2) was 1.5-fold higher than that of women with moderate BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m2). The infertility incidence of women with little exercise was 4 times more than that of women with regular exercise, and 2 times more than that of women with heavy exercise. The group with moderate menstrual flow had the lowest prevalence of infertility, while both scant and excessive menstruation led to increased infertility incidence. Number of pregnancies (OR = 0.63; 95% CI, 0.51-0.79) was a protective factor for infertility, while the number of abortions (OR = 2.15; 95% CI, 1.58-2.93) was a risk factor for infertility. For men, those who stayed up late at night more than 3 times per week showed a significantly higher infertility incidence. Men who engaged in occupations with high-temperature working environment also suffered from an infertility incidence of about four times more than the others.We found significant association between women's infertility incidence with their BMI, state of exercise, amount of menstrual flow, number of pregnancies and number of abortions. As for men, both staying up late and engaging in high-temperature occupations are independent factors affecting their fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2369433118,"Hong Kong imposed a partial restriction on application of organotin-based antifouling paints in 1992. Since September 2008, the International Maritime Organization prohibited the use of such antifouling systems on all sea-going vessels globally. Therefore, it is anticipated a gradual reduction of organotin contamination in Hong Kong’s marine waters. Using the rock shell Reishia clavigera as a biomonitor, we evaluated the organotin contamination along Hong Kong’s coastal waters over the past two decades (1990–2015). In 2010 and 2015, adult R. clavigera were examined for imposex status and analysed for tissue concentrations of six organotins. We consistently found 100% imposex incidence in female R. clavigera across all sites. Tissue triphenyltin (TPT) concentrations were high in most samples. A probabilistic risk assessment showed that there were over 69% of chance that local R. clavigera would be at risk due to exposure to phenyltins. Comparing with those of previous surveys (2004–2010), both imposex levels and tissue concentrations of organotins did not decline, while the ecological risks due to exposure to organotins were increasing. We also observed high concentrations of monobutyltin and TPT in seawater and sediment from locations with intense shipping activities and from stormwater or sewage discharge. Overall, organotins are still prevalent in Hong Kong’s marine waters showing that the global convention alone may be inadequate in reducing organotin contamination in a busy international port like Hong Kong. Appropriate management actions should be taken to control the use and release of organotins in Hong Kong and South China."

Although Warburg effect is considered a peculiarity critical for survival and proliferation of cancer cells, the regulatory mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain incompletely understood. We report here that eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2K), a negative regulator of protein synthesis, has a critical role in promoting glycolysis in cancer cells. We showed that deficiency in eEF-2K significantly reduced the uptake of glucose and decreased the productions of lactate and adenosine triphosphate in tumor cells and in the Ras-transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts. We further demonstrated that the promotive effect of eEF-2K on glycolysis resulted from the kinase-mediated restriction of synthesis of the protein phosphatase 2A-A (PP2A-A), a key factor that facilitates the ubiquitin–proteasomal degradation of c-Myc protein, as knockdown of eEF-2K expression led to a significant increase in PP2A-A protein synthesis and remarkable downregulation of c-Myc and pyruvate kinase M2 isoform, the key glycolytic enzyme transcriptionally activated by c-Myc. In addition, depletion of eEF-2K reduced the ability of the transformed cells to proliferate and enhanced the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy both in vitro and in vivo. These results, which uncover a role of the eEF-2K-mediated control of PP2A-A in tumor cell glycolysis, provide new insights into the regulation of the Warburg effect."
https://openalex.org/W2405241713,"We have recently identified and characterized a novel oncogene, maelstrom (MAEL) from 1q24, in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, MAEL was investigated for its oncogenic role in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) tumorigenesis/aggressiveness and underlying molecular mechanisms. Here, we report that overexpression of MAEL in UCB is important in the acquisition of an aggressive and/or poor prognostic phenotype. In UCB cell lines, knockdown of MAEL by short hairpin RNA is sufficient to inhibit cell growth, invasiveness/metastasis and suppressed epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), whereas ectopic overexpression of MAEL promoted cell growth, invasive and/or metastatic capacity and enhanced EMT both in vitro and in vivo. We further demonstrate that MAEL could induce UCB cell EMT by downregulating a critical downstream target, the metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) gene, ultimately leading to an increased invasiveness of cancer cells. Notably, overexpression of MAEL in UCB cells substantially enhanced the enrichment of DNA methyltrans-ferase (DNMT)3B and histone deacetylase (HDAC)1/2 on the promoter of the MTSS1, and thereby epigenetically suppressing the MTSS1 transcription. Downregulation of MTSS1 by MAEL in UCB cells is partially dependent on DNMT3B. Furthermore, we identify that beside the gene amplification of MAEL, miR-186 is a key negative regulator of MAEL and downregulation of miR-186 is another important mechanism for MAEL overexpression in UCBs. These data suggest that overexpression of MAEL, caused by gene amplification and/or decreased miR-186, has a critical oncogenic role in UCB pathogenesis by downregulation of MTSS1, and MAEL could be used as a novel prognostic marker and/or effective therapeutic target for human UCB."
https://openalex.org/W2407964502,"Melanoma progression is associated with increased invasion and, often, decreased levels of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Accordingly, downregulation of MITF induces invasion in melanoma cells; however, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here, we report for the first time that depletion of MITF results in elevation of intracellular GTP levels and increased amounts of active (GTP-bound) RAC1, RHO-A and RHO-C. Concomitantly, MITF-depleted cells display larger number of invadopodia and increased invasion. We further demonstrate that the gene for guanosine monophosphate reductase (GMPR) is a direct MITF target, and that the partial repression of GMPR accounts mostly for the above phenotypes in MITF-depleted cells. Reciprocally, transactivation of GMPR is required for MITF-dependent suppression of melanoma cell invasion, tumorigenicity and lung colonization. Moreover, loss of GMPR accompanies downregulation of MITF in vemurafenib-resistant BRAFV600E-melanoma cells and underlies the increased invasion in these cells. Our data uncover novel mechanisms linking MITF-dependent inhibition of invasion to suppression of guanylate metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2376366904,"Geochemical concentrations were extracted for a short sediment core from Ebinur Lake, located in arid northwest China, and mathematical methods were used to demonstrate the complex pattern of the geochemical anomalies resulting from the temporal changes in natural and anthropogenic forces on the lake sediments. The first element assemblage (C1) (aluminum, potassium, iron, magnesium, beryllium, etc.) was predominantly terrigenous; among the assemblage, total phosphorus and titanium were generally consistent with aluminum except with regards to their surface sequences, which inferred the differences of source regions for terrigenous detrital material led to this change around ca. 2000AD. The second assemblage (C2) (calcium and strontium) was found to have a negative relationship with aluminum through a cluster analysis. The third assemblage (C3) included sodium and magnesium, which were influenced by the underwater lake environment and deposited in the Ebinur depression. The concentration ratio of C1/(C1+C2) was used as an indicator for denudation amount of detrital materials, which was supported by the values of magnetic susceptibility. The enrichment factors for heavy metals suggested that the influence of human activities on heavy-metal enrichment in Ebinur Lake region was not severe over the past century. Prior to the 1960s, geochemical indicators suggested a stable lacustrine environment with higher water levels. Beginning in the 1960s, high agricultural water demand resulted in rapid declines in lake water level, with subsequent increases of lake water salinity, as evidenced by enhanced sodium concentration in lake core sediments. During this period, anthropogenic activity also enhanced the intensity of weathering and the denudation of the Ebinur watershed."
https://openalex.org/W2407937597,"Agarwood is a traditional Chinese medicine used as a clinical sedative, carminative, and antiemetic drug. Agarwood is formed in Aquilaria sinensis when A. sinensis trees are threatened by external physical, chemical injury or endophytic fungal irritation. However, the mechanism of agarwood formation via chemical induction remains unclear. In this study, we characterized the transcriptome of different parts of a chemically induced A. sinensis trunk sample with agarwood. The Illumina sequencing platform was used to identify the genes involved in agarwood formation.A five-year-old Aquilaria sinensis treated by formic acid was selected. The white wood part (B1 sample), the transition part between agarwood and white wood (W2 sample), the agarwood part (J3 sample), and the rotten wood part (F5 sample) were collected for transcriptome sequencing. Accordingly, 54,685,634 clean reads, which were assembled into 83,467 unigenes, were obtained with a Q20 value of 97.5%. A total of 50,565 unigenes were annotated using the Nr, Nt, SWISS-PROT, KEGG, COG, and GO databases. In particular, 171,331,352 unigenes were annotated by various pathways, including the sesquiterpenoid (ko00909) and plant-pathogen interaction (ko03040) pathways. These pathways were related to sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis and defensive responses to chemical stimulation.The transcriptome data of the different parts of the chemically induced A. sinensis trunk provide a rich source of materials for discovering and identifying the genes involved in sesquiterpenoid production and in defensive responses to chemical stimulation. This study is the first to use de novo sequencing and transcriptome assembly for different parts of chemically induced A. sinensis. Results demonstrate that the sesquiterpenoid biosynthesis pathway and WRKY transcription factor play important roles in agarwood formation via chemical induction. The comparative analysis of the transcriptome data of agarwood and A. sinensis lays the foundation for elucidating the mechanism of agarwood formation via chemical induction, and thus, enables future improvements in agarwood quality while protecting endangered wild A. sinensis."
https://openalex.org/W2384616913,"We present a palaeoenvironmental study of the Castelló lagoon (NE Spain), an important archive for understanding long-term interactions between dynamic littoral ecosystems and human management. Combining geochemistry, mineralogy, ostracods, diatoms, pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs, charcoal and archaeo-historical datasets we reconstruct: 1) the transition of the lagoon from a marine to a marginal environment between ~3150 cal BC to the 17th century AD; 2) fluctuations in salinity; and 3) natural and anthropogenic forces contributing to these changes. From the Late Neolithic to the Medieval period the lagoon ecosystem was driven by changing marine influence and the land was mainly exploited for grazing, with little evidence for impact on the natural woodland. Land-use exploitation adapted to natural coastal dynamics, with maximum marine flooding hampering agropastoral activities between ~1550 and ~150 cal BC. In contrast, societies actively controlled the lagoon dynamics and become a major agent of landscape transformation after the Medieval period. The removal of littoral woodlands after the 8th century was followed by the expansion of agrarian and industrial activities. Regional mining and smelting activities polluted the lagoon with heavy metals from the ~11th century onwards. The expansion of the milling industry and of agricultural lands led to the channelization of the river Muga into the lagoon after ~1250 cal AD. This caused its transformation into a freshwater lake, increased nutrient load, and the infilling and drainage of a great part of the lagoon. By tracking the shift towards an anthropogenically-controlled system around ~750 yr ago, this study points out Mediterranean lagoons as ancient and heavily-modified systems, with anthropogenic impacts and controls covering multi-centennial and even millennial timescales. Finally, we contributed to the future construction of reliable seashell-based chronologies in NE Spain by calibrating the Banyuls-sur-Mer ΔR offset with ceramic imports from the Emporiae archaeological site."
https://openalex.org/W2363808888,"Ideally, thrombophilia testing should be tailored to the type of thrombotic event without the influence of anticoagulation therapy or acute phase effects which can give false positive results that may result in long term anticoagulation. However, thrombophilia testing is often performed routinely in unselected patients. We analyzed all consecutive thrombophilia testing orders during the months of October and November 2009 at an academic teaching institution. Information was extracted from electronic medical records for the following: indication, timing, comprehensiveness of tests, anticoagulation therapy at the time of testing, and confirmatory repeat testing, if any. Based on the findings of this analysis, we established local guidelines in May 2013 for appropriate thrombophilia testing, primarily to prevent testing during the acute thrombotic event or while the patient is on anticoagulation. We then evaluated ordering practices 22 months after guideline implementation. One hundred seventy-three patients were included in the study. Only 34% (58/173) had appropriate indications (unprovoked venous or arterial thrombosis or pregnancy losses). 51% (61/119) with an index clinical event were tested within one week of the event. Although 46% (79/173) were found to have abnormal results, only 46% of these had the abnormal tests repeated for confirmation with 54% potentially carrying a wrong diagnosis with long term anticoagulation. Twenty-two months after guideline implementation, there was an 84% reduction in ordered tests. Thus, this study revealed that a significant proportion of thrombophilia testing was inappropriately performed. We implemented local guidelines for thrombophilia testing for clinicians, resulting in a reduction in healthcare costs and improved patient care."
https://openalex.org/W2380492048,"Objective This study analysed clinical and sociodemographic aspects and follow-up for notified cases of tuberculosis (TB) and explored inequalities in incidence rates and outcome by colour or race and the geographic macro-regions of Brazil. Methods This paper reports the results of a population-based descriptive epidemiological study of all notified cases of TB in Brazil during the period from 01/01/2008 to 31/12/2011. We analysed sociodemographic and clinical variables according to colour or race (white, black, Asian, mixed, and indigenous) and geographic macro-regions of the country (North, Northeast, Central-West, South, and Southeast). Results During the study period, the average incidence of TB in Brazil was 36.7 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, with the highest rates occurring in the North and Southeast regions. The analysis of TB notifications by colour or race revealed that the indigenous population presented the highest incidence rates in all macro-regions except the South, where higher rates were reported in black patients. ‘Cured’ was the most frequently reported treatment outcome for all skin colour categories. The highest cure rate occurred among the indigenous population (76.8%), while the lowest cure rate occurred among the black population (70.7%). Rates of treatment default were highest among blacks (10.5%) and lowest among the indigenous population (6.9%). However, the fatality rate was similar across race categories, varying between 2.8% and 3.8% for whites and the indigenous population, respectively. The lowest cure rates were observed when follow-up was inadequate (58.3%), and the highest was observed when the follow-up was classified as excellent (96.8%). Conclusions This study revealed that—apart from the heterogeneous distribution of TB among the Brazilian macro-regions—ethnic-racial inequalities exist in terms of clinical-epidemiological characteristics and incidence rates as well as follow-up for cases undergoing treatment. The highest rates of TB occurred among the indigenous people."
https://openalex.org/W2405518779,"Hypoxia and inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6, IL6) are strongly linked to cancer progression, and signal in part through the transcription factor Ccaat/enhancer-binding protein δ (C/EBPδ, CEBPD), which has been shown to promote mesenchymal features and malignant progression of glioblastoma. Here we report a different role for C/EBPδ in breast cancer. We found that the C/EBPδ protein is expressed in normal breast epithelial cells and in low-grade cancers. C/EBPδ protein (but not mRNA) expression correlates with estrogen receptor (ER+) and progesterone receptor (PGR) expression and longer progression-free survival of breast cancer patients. Specifically in ER+ breast cancers, CEBPD—but not the related CEBPB—mRNA in combination with IL6 correlated with lower risk of progression. Functional studies in cell lines showed that ERα promotes C/EBPδ expression at the level of protein stability by inhibition of the FBXW7 pathway. Furthermore, we found that C/EBPδ attenuates cell growth, motility and invasiveness by inhibiting expression of the SNAI2 (Slug) transcriptional repressor, which leads to expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A (p21CIP1/WAF1). These findings identify a molecular mechanism by which ERα signaling reduces the aggressiveness of cancer cells, and demonstrate that C/EBPδ can have different functions in different types of cancer. Furthermore, our results support a potentially beneficial role for the IL-6 pathway specifically in ER+ breast cancer and call for further evaluation of the role of intra-tumoral IL-6 expression and of which cancers might benefit from current attempts to target the IL-6 pathway as a therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2378725980,"Plant genome engineering using sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) promises to advance basic and applied plant research by enabling precise modification of endogenous genes. Whereas DNA is an effective means for delivering SSNs, DNA can integrate randomly into the plant genome, leading to unintentional gene inactivation. Further, prolonged expression of SSNs from DNA constructs can lead to the accumulation of off-target mutations. Here, we tested a new approach for SSN delivery to plant cells, namely transformation of messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding TAL effector nucleases (TALENs). mRNA delivery of a TALEN pair targeting the Nicotiana benthamiana ALS gene resulted in mutation frequencies of approximately 6% in comparison to DNA delivery, which resulted in mutation frequencies of 70.5%. mRNA delivery resulted in three-fold fewer insertions, and 76% were <10bp; in contrast, 88% of insertions generated through DNA delivery were >10bp. In an effort to increase mutation frequencies using mRNA, we fused several different 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) from Arabidopsis thaliana genes to the TALEN coding sequence. UTRs from an A. thaliana adenine nucleotide α hydrolases-like gene (At1G09740) enhanced mutation frequencies approximately two-fold, relative to a no-UTR control. These results indicate that mRNA can be used as a delivery vehicle for SSNs, and that manipulation of mRNA UTRs can influence efficiencies of genome editing."
https://openalex.org/W2371395013,"Alginate-degrading bacteria play an important role in alginate degradation by harboring highly efficient and unique alginolytic genes. Although the general mechanism for alginate degradation by these bacteria is fairly understood, much is still required to fully exploit them. Here, we report the isolation of a novel strain, Falsirhodobacter sp. alg1, the first report for an alginate-degrading bacterium from the family Rhodobacteraceae. Genome sequencing reveals that strain alg1 harbors a primary alginate degradation pathway with only single homologs of an endo- and exo-type alginate lyase, AlyFRA and AlyFRB, which is uncommon among such bacteria. Subsequent functional analysis showed that both enzymes were extremely efficient to depolymerize alginate suggesting evolutionary interests in the acquirement of these enzymes. The exo-type alginate lyase, AlyFRB in particular could depolymerize alginate without producing intermediate products making it a highly efficient enzyme for the production of 4-deoxy-L-erythro-5-hexoseulose uronic acid (DEH). Based on our findings, we believe that the discovery of Falsirhodobacter sp. alg1 and its alginolytic genes hints at the potentiality of a more diverse and unique population of alginate-degrading bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2371497729,"Thrombocytopenia is a common finding in small for gestational age (SGA) neonates and is thought to result from a unique pathophysiologic mechanism related to chronic intrauterine hypoxia. Our objective was to estimate the incidence and severity of early-onset thrombocytopenia in SGA neonates, and to identify risk factors for thrombocytopenia. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all consecutive SGA neonates admitted to our ward and a control group of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates matched for gestational age at birth. Main outcome measures were incidence and severity of thrombocytopenia, hematological and clinical risk factors for thrombocytopenia, and bleeding. A total of 330 SGA and 330 AGA neonates were included, with a mean gestational age at birth of 32.9 ± 4 weeks. Thrombocytopenia (<150x109/L) was found in 53% (176/329) of SGA neonates and 20% (66/330) of AGA neonates (relative risk (RR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.1, 3.4]). Severe thrombocytopenia (21-50x109/L) occurred in 25 neonates (8%) in the SGA and 2 neonates (1%) in the AGA group (RR 12.5, 95% CI [3.0, 52.5]). Platelet counts <20x109/L were not recorded. Within the SGA group, lower gestational age at birth (p = <0.01) and erythroblastosis (p<0.01) were independently associated with a decrease in platelet count. Platelet count was positively correlated with birth weight centiles. In conclusion, early-onset thrombocytopenia is present in over 50% of SGA neonates and occurs 2.7 times as often as in AGA neonates. Thrombocytopenia is seldom severe and is independently associated with lower gestational age at birth and erythroblastosis."
https://openalex.org/W2381287051,"Mitochondrial DNA sequences, often in combination with nuclear markers and morphological data, are frequently used to unravel the phylogenetic relationships, population dynamics and biogeographic histories of a plethora of organisms. The information provided by examining complete mitochondrial genomes also enables investigation of other evolutionary events such as gene rearrangements, gene duplication and gene loss. Despite efforts to generate information to represent most of the currently recognized groups, some taxa are underrepresented in mitochondrial genomic databases. One such group is leeches (Annelida: Hirudinea: Clitellata). Herein, we expand our knowledge concerning leech mitochondrial makeup including gene arrangement, gene duplication and the evolution of mitochondrial genomes by adding newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes for three bloodfeeding species: Haementeria officinalis, Placobdella lamothei and Placobdella parasitica. With the inclusion of three new mitochondrial genomes of leeches, a better understanding of evolution for this organelle within the group is emerging. We found that gene order and genomic arrangement in the three new mitochondrial genomes is identical to previously sequenced members of Clitellata. Interestingly, within Placobdella, we recovered a genus-specific duplication of the trnD gene located between cox2 and atp8. We performed phylogenetic analyses using 12 protein-coding genes and expanded our taxon sampling by including GenBank sequences for 39 taxa; the analyses confirm the monophyletic status of Clitellata, yet disagree in several respects with other phylogenetic hypotheses based on morphology and analyses of non-mitochondrial data."

The spread of Bd along highland habitats (> 500 meters above sea level, m a.s.l.) of Costa Rica and Panamá is well documented and has been linked to amphibian population collapses. In contrast, data are scarce on the prevalence and dispersal of Bd in lowland habitats where amphibians may be infected but asymptomatic. Here we describe the spread (2009 to 2014) of Bd across lowland habitats east of the Panamá Canal (< 500 m a.s.l.) with a focus on the Túngara frog (Physalaemus [Engystomops] pustulosus), one of the most common and abundant frog species in this region. Highland populations in western Panamá were already infected with Bd at the start of the study, which was consistent with previous studies indicating that Bd is enzootic in this region. In central Panamá, we collected the first positive samples in 2010, and by 2014, we detected Bd from remote sites in eastern Panamá (Darién National Park). We discuss the importance of studying Bd in lowland species, which may serve as potential reservoirs and agents of dispersal of Bd to highland species that are more susceptible to chytridiomycosis."

To characterize GADAb-positive patients with adult-onset diabetes who do not require insulin therapy for >5 years (NIR-SPIDDM), we conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey in Japan. Methods We collected 82 GADAb-positive patients who did not require insulin therapy for >5 years (NIR-SPIDDM) and compared them with 63 patients with insulin-requiring SPIDDM (IR-SPIDDM). Clinical and biochemical characteristics, HLA-DRB1-DQB1 haplotypes, and predictive markers for progression to insulin therapy were investigated. Results Compared with the IR-SPIDDM group, the NIR-SPIDDM patients showed later diabetes onset, higher body mass index, longer duration before diagnosis, and less frequent hyperglycemic symptoms at onset. In addition, C-peptide, LDL-cholesterol, and TG were significantly higher in the NIR-SPIDDM compared to IR-SPIDDM patients. The NIR-SPIDDM group had lower frequency of susceptible HLA-DRB1*04:05-DQB1*04:01 and a higher frequency of resistant HLA-DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02 haplotype compared to IR-SPIDDM. A multivariable analysis showed that age at diabetes onset (OR = 0.82), duration before diagnosis of GADAb-positive diabetes (OR = 0.82), higher GADAb level (≥10.0 U/ml) (OR = 20.41), and fasting C-peptide at diagnosis (OR = 0.07) were independent predictive markers for progression to insulin-requiring diabetes. An ROC curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off points for discriminating two groups was the GADAb level of 13.6 U/ml, age of diabetes onset of 47 years, duration before diagnosis of 5 years, and fasting C-peptide of 0.65 ng/ml. Conclusions Clinical, biochemical and genetic characteristics of patients with NIR-SPIDDM are different from those of IR-SPIDDM patients. Age of diabetes onset, duration before GADAb-positivity, GADAb level, and fasting C-peptide at diagnosis must be carefully considered in planning prevention trials for SPIDDM."

Overexpression of Skp2 coupled with underexpression of p27 are frequent characteristics of cancer cells. When the role of SCFSkp2/Cks1-mediated p27 ubiquitination in cancer was specifically tested by p27 Thr187-to-Ala knockin (p27T187A KI), it was found dispensable for KrasG12D-induced lung tumorigenesis but essential for Rb1-deficient pituitary tumorigenesis. Here we identify pRb and p53 doubly deficient (DKO) prostate tumorigenesis as a context in which p27 ubiquitination by SCFSkp2/Cks1 is required for p27 downregulation. p27 protein accumulated in prostate when p27T187A KI mice underwent DKO prostate tumorigenesis. p27T187A KI or Skp2 knockdown (KD) induced similar degrees of p27 protein accumulation in DKO prostate cells, and Skp2 KD did not further increase p27 protein in DKO prostate cells that contained p27T187A KI (AADKO prostate cells). p27T187A KI activated an E2F1-p73-apoptosis axis in DKO prostate tumorigenesis, slowed disease progression and significantly extended survival. Querying co-occurrence relationships among RB1, TP53, PTEN, NKX3-1 and MYC in TCGA of prostate cancer identified co-inactivation of RB1 and TP53 as the only statistically significant co-occurrences in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Together, our study identifies Skp2/Cks1 pocket inhibitors as potential therapeutics for mCRPC. Procedures for establishing mCRPC organoid cultures from contemporary patients were recently established. An Skp2/Cks1 pocket inhibitor preferentially collapsed DKO prostate tumor organoids over AADKO organoids, which spontaneously disintegrated over time when DKO prostate tumor organoids grew larger, setting the stage to translate mouse model findings to precision medicine in the clinic on the organoid platform."

Here we investigated the effects of a low protein diet on ASF colonization and its ability to engineer the microbiota. Initially, ASF inoculation was similar between mice fed a normal protein diet or low protein diet, but the outgrowth of gut microbiota differed over the ensuing month. Notable was the inability of the dominant Parabacteroides ASF taxon to exclude other taxa belonging to the Bacteroidetes phylum in the setting of a low protein diet. Instead, a poorly classified yet highly represented Bacteroidetes family, S24-7, returned within 4 weeks of inoculation in mice fed a low protein diet, demonstrating a reduction in ASF resilience in response to dietary stress. Nevertheless, fecal ammonia levels remained significantly lower than those observed in mice on the same low protein diet that received a transplant of normal feces. No deleterious effects were observed in host physiology due to ASF inoculation into mice on a low protein diet. In total, these results demonstrate that low protein diet can have a pronounced effect on engineering the gut microbiota but modulation of ammonia is preserved."

The current study examined changes in adolescent depression, conduct problems and substance use (alcohol, tobacco and marijuana) across the peripartum period using risk-set propensity scores derived from a population-based, prospective study that began in childhood (the Pittsburgh Girls Study, PGS). Each of 147 childbearing adolescents (ages 12–19) was matched with two same-age, non-childbearing adolescents (n = 294) on pregnancy propensity using 15 time-varying risk variables derived from sociodemographic, psychopathology, substance use, family, peer and neighborhood domains assessed in the PGS wave prior to each pregnancy (T1). Postpartum depression and problem behaviors were assessed within the first 6 months following delivery (T2); data gathered from the non-childbearing adolescent controls spanned the same interval. Within the childbearing group, conduct problems and marijuana use reduced from T1 to T2, but depression severity and frequency of alcohol or tobacco use showed no change. When change was compared across the matched groups, conduct problems showed a greater reduction among childbearing adolescents. Relative to non-childbearing adolescents who reported more frequent substance use with time, childbearing adolescents reported no change in alcohol use and less frequent use of marijuana across the peripartum period. There were no group differences in patterns of change for depression severity and tobacco use. The results do not support the notion that adolescent childbearing represents a period of heightened risk for depression or problem behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2350748103,"The ferric uptake regulator (Fur) family proteins include sensors of Fe (Fur), Zn (Zur), and peroxide (PerR). Among Fur family proteins, Fur and Zur are ubiquitous in most prokaryotic organisms, whereas PerR exists mainly in Gram positive bacteria as a functional homologue of OxyR. Gram positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus encode three Fur family proteins: Fur, Zur, and PerR. In this study, we identified five Fur family proteins from B. licheniformis: two novel PerR-like proteins (BL00690 and BL00950) in addition to Fur (BL05249), Zur (BL03703), and PerR (BL00075) homologues. Our data indicate that all of the five B. licheniformis Fur homologues contain a structural Zn2+ site composed of four cysteine residues like many other Fur family proteins. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the PerR-like proteins (BL00690 and BL00950) as well as PerRBL (BL00075), but not FurBL (BL05249) and ZurBL (BL03703), can sense H2O2 by histidine oxidation with different sensitivity. We also show that PerR2 (BL00690) has a PerR-like repressor activity for PerR-regulated genes in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that B. licheniformis contains three PerR subfamily proteins which can sense H2O2 by histidine oxidation not by cysteine oxidation, in addition to Fur and Zur."

Those subjects with positive hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) screened in the community before were invited to this study and 451 responded. All participants underwent anthropometric measurements, blood tests, ultrasound and fibroscan examinations. The cut-off of liver stiffness measurement-liver cirrhosis (LSM-LC) was 10 kPa for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients and 12 kPa for chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients, respectively. Among 451 responders, 56 were excluded due to negative HBsAg or anti-HCV. Three hundreds and ninety-five subjects included 228 CHB patients, 156 CHC patients and 11 dual hepatitis patients, had a mean age of 62±12.6 years. Fifty-four (23.7%) CHB patients coexisted with MetS whereas 40 (25.6%) CHC patients also had MetS. Those patients with MetS had more LSM-LC cases than those without (20.4% vs 9.8%, p = 0.04 in CHB patients; 28.2% vs 13.5%, p = 0.037 in CHC patients, respectively). In multivariate logistic analysis, detectable viremia was reversely associated with MetS in CHB patients after adjustment for age, gender and body mass index (odds ratio (OR): 0.42; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18-0.99; p = 0.047). Regarding CHC patients, higher LSM level was the only factor contributed to MetS (OR: 1.1; 95% CI: 1.02-1.19; p = 0.012). In conclusion, elder CHB patients coexisted with MetS might experience an inactive virus replication but have an advanced liver fibrosis. In elder CHC patients, only higher LSM level was associated with MetS."

The aim of this work was to analyse whether activation of MC3-R, by administration of its agonist D-Trp(8)-γMSH, is able to modify the response of skeletal muscle to inflammation induced by lipopolysaccharide endotoxin (LPS) or TNFα. Adult male rats were injected with 250 μg/kg LPS and/or 500 μg/kg D-Trp(8)-γMSH 17:00 h and at 8:00 h the following day, and euthanized 4 hours afterwards. D-Trp(8)-γMSH decreased LPS-induced anorexia and prevented the stimulatory effect of LPS on hypothalamic IL-1β, COX-2 and CRH as well as on serum ACTH and corticosterone. Serum IGF-I and its expression in liver and gastrocnemius were decreased in rats injected with LPS, but not in those that also received D-Trp(8)-γMSH. However, D-Trp(8)-γMSH was unable to modify the effect of LPS on IGFBP-3. In the gastrocnemius D-Trp(8)-γMSH blocked LPS-induced decrease in pAkt, pmTOR, MHC I and MCH II, as well as the increase in pNF-κB(p65), FoxO1, FoxO3, LC3b, Bnip-3, Gabarap1, atrogin-1, MuRF1 and in LC3a/b lipidation. In L6 myotube cultures, D-Trp(8)-γMSH was able to prevent TNFα-induced increase of NF-κB(p65) phosphorylation and decrease of Akt phosphorylation as well as of IGF-I and MHC I expression. These data suggest that MC3-R activation prevents the effect of endotoxin on skeletal wasting by modifying inflammation, corticosterone and IGF-I responses and also by directly acting on muscle cells through the TNFα/NF-κB(p65) pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2347235773,"A multilocus fragment typing approach including eleven variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) loci and the GP60 gene was used to investigate the intra-farm and intra-host genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium parvum in sheep farms in a confined area in northeastern Spain. Genomic DNA samples of 113 C. parvum isolates from diarrheic pre-weaned lambs collected in 49 meat-type sheep farms were analyzed. Loci exhibited various degrees of polymorphism, the finding of 7–9 alleles in the four most variable and discriminatory markers (ML2, Cgd6_5400, Cgd6_3940, and GP60) being remarkable. The combination of alleles at the twelve loci identified a total of 74 multilocus subtypes (MLTs) and provided a Hunter-Gaston discriminatory index of 0.988 (95% CI, 0.979−0.996). The finding that most MLTs (n = 64) were unique to individual farms evidenced that cryptosporidial infection is mainly transmitted within sheep flocks, with herd-to-herd transmission playing a secondary role. Limited intra- host variability was found, since only five isolates were genotypically mixed. In contrast, a significant intra-farm genetic diversity was seen, with the presence of multiple MLTs on more than a half of the farms (28/46), suggesting frequent mutations or genetic exchange through recombination. Comparison with a previous study in calves in northern Spain using the same 12-loci typing approach showed differences in the identity of major alleles at most loci, with a single MLT being shared between lambs and calves. Analysis of evolutionary descent by the algorithm eBURST indicated a high degree of genetic divergence, with over 41% MLTs appearing as singletons along with a high number of clonal complexes, most of them linking only two MLTs. Bayesian Structure analysis and F statistics also revealed the genetic remoteness of most C. parvum isolates and no ancestral population size was chosen. Linkage analysis evidenced a prevalent pattern of clonality within the parasite population."

However, conventional echocardiography often fails to reveal myocardial depression in severe sepsis. Recently, strain measurements based on speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) have been used to evaluate cardiac function.To investigate the role of STE in detecting lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cardiac dysfunction, M-mode and 2-D echocardiography were used in LPS-treated mice.The mice were treated with a 10mg/kg (n = 10), 20mg/kg (n = 10) or 25mg/kg LPS (n = 30) to induce cardiac dysfunction. Subsequently, the ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) were measured with standard M-mode tracings, whereas the circumferential (Scirc) and radial strain (Srad) were measured with STE. Serum biochemical and cardiac histopathological examinations were performed to assess sepsis-induced myocardial injury.20mg/kg LPS resulted in more deterioration, myocardial damage and cardiac contractile dysfunction based on serum biochemical and histological examinations. The mice that were subjected to 20mg/kg LPS exhibited reduced Scirc but no reduction in Srad, whereas on conventional echocardiography, the ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) were similar in the 10mg/kg and 20mg/kg groups. Moreover, Scirc was positively correlated with body temperature in the mice at 20 h after LPS injection (r = 0.746, p = 0.001), but no significant correlation was observed between Srad and body temperature (r = 0.356, p = 0.123). Moreover, the mice with high Scirc (-5.9% to -10.4%) exhibited reduced mortality following the administration of 25mg/kg LPS (p = 0.03) compared with the low-strain group (-2% to -5.9%).Taken together, our findings indicate that circumferential strain is a specific and reliable indicator for evaluating LPS-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2371554529,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the combined effects of soil biotic and abiotic factors on the incidence of Fusarium corn stalk rot, during four annual incorporations of two types of sewage sludge into soil in a 5-years field assay under tropical conditions and to predict the effects of these variables on the disease. For each type of sewage sludge, the following treatments were included: control with mineral fertilization recommended for corn; control without fertilization; sewage sludge based on the nitrogen concentration that provided the same amount of nitrogen as in the mineral fertilizer treatment; and sewage sludge that provided two, four and eight times the nitrogen concentration recommended for corn. Increasing dosages of both types of sewage sludge incorporated into soil resulted in increased corn stalk rot incidence, being negatively correlated with corn yield. A global analysis highlighted the effect of the year of the experiment, followed by the sewage sludge dosages. The type of sewage sludge did not affect the disease incidence. A multiple logistic model using a stepwise procedure was fitted based on the selection of a model that included the three explanatory parameters for disease incidence: electrical conductivity, magnesium and Fusarium population. In the selected model, the probability of higher disease incidence increased with an increase of these three explanatory parameters. When the explanatory parameters were compared, electrical conductivity presented a dominant effect and was the main variable to predict the probability distribution curves of Fusarium corn stalk rot, after sewage sludge application into the soil."

Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for their anti-adipogenic effects. Both LFE and FSB inhibited the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes induced by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonists, accompanied by reductions in the expressions of the lipogenic genes aP2, CD36, and FAS. Moreover, LFE and FSB inhibited PPARγ transactivation activity with IC50s of 22.5 μg/ml and 7.63 μg/ml, respectively, and showed selectivity against PPARα and PPARδ. Rosiglitazone-induced interaction between PPARγ ligand binding domain (LBD) and coactivator SRC-1 was blocked by LFE or FSB, whereas reduced NCoR-1 binding to PPARγ by rosiglitazone was reversed in the presence of LFE or FSB. In vivo administration of LFE into either ob/ob mice or KKAy mice reduced body weights, and levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα in fat tissues. Furthermore, insulin resistance was ameliorated by LFE treatment, with reduced adipose tissue inflammation and hepatic steatosis. Thus, LFE and FSB were found to act as PPARγ antagonists that improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic profiles. We propose that LFE and its active component FSB offer a new therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders including obesity and insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2360417578,"Studying the dynamic of gene regulatory networks is essential in order to understand the specific signals and factors that govern cell proliferation and differentiation during development. This also has direct implication in human health and cancer biology. The general transcriptional elongation regulator P-TEFb regulates the transcriptional status of many developmental genes. Its biological activity is controlled by an inhibitory complex composed of HEXIM and the 7SK snRNA. Here, we examine the function of HEXIM during Drosophila development. Our key finding is that HEXIM affects the Hedgehog signaling pathway. HEXIM knockdown flies display strong phenotypes and organ failures. In the wing imaginal disc, HEXIM knockdown initially induces ectopic expression of Hedgehog (Hh) and its transcriptional effector Cubitus interuptus (Ci). In turn, deregulated Hedgehog signaling provokes apoptosis, which is continuously compensated by apoptosis-induced cell proliferation. Thus, the HEXIM knockdown mutant phenotype does not result from the apoptotic ablation of imaginal disc; but rather from the failure of dividing cells to commit to a proper developmental program due to Hedgehog signaling defects. Furthermore, we show that ci is a genetic suppressor of hexim. Thus, HEXIM ensures the integrity of Hedgehog signaling in wing imaginal disc, by a yet unknown mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the physiological function of HEXIM has been addressed in such details in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2374477641,"Aquatic birds have high cost of thermoregulation, especially during the moulting period, yet the effect of water temperature on the moulting strategy of aquatic birds has rarely been studied. Our general hypothesis is that energy savings associated with lower thermoregulation costs would be allocated to moulting processes. We predicted that aquatic birds moulting in warm water would have a higher level of body reserves, a faster growth rate of feathers, and an earlier remigial moult onset compared with birds moulting in cold water. We used the common eider (Somateria mollissima dresseri), a large sea duck, as the model species. Captive individuals were experimentally exposed to warm (18°C) and cold (8°C) water treatments during a three year period with individuals swapped between treatments. We found a similar feather growth rate for the two water temperature treatments and in contrast to our predictions, eiders exposed to warm water had a lower body mass and showed a delayed onset of remigial moult of approximately 7 days compared with those exposed to cold water. Our data indicate that body mass variations influence the timing of moult in unexpected ways and we suggest that it likely controls the occurrence of wing moult through a hormonal cascade. This study emphasizes the importance of improving our knowledge of the effects of water temperature on remigial moult of aquatic birds, to better assert the potential effects of global warming on their survival."
