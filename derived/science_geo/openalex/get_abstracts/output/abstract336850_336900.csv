https://openalex.org/W2033297392,"The observation by transmission electron microscopy of six different stable aggregate morphologies is reported for the same family of highly asymmetric polystyrene-poly-(acrylic acid) block copolymers prepared in a low molecular weight solvent system. Four of the morphologies consist of spheres, rods, lamellae, and vesicles in aqueous solution, whereas the fifth consists of simple reverse micelle-like aggregates. The sixth consists of up to micrometer-size spheres in aqueous solution that have hydrophilic surfaces and are filled with the reverse micelle-like aggregates. In addition, a needle-like solid, which is highly birefringent, is obtained on drying of aqueous solutions of the spherical micelles. This range of morphologies is believed to be unprecedented for a block copolymer system."
https://openalex.org/W2058557544,"A method that combines thin film deposition and physical masking techniques has been used for the parallel synthesis of spatially addressable libraries of solid-state materials. Arrays containing different combinations, stoichiometries, and deposition sequences of BaCO(3), Bi(2)O(3), CaO, CuO, PbO, SrCO(3), and Y(2)O(3) were generated with a series of binary masks. The arrays were sintered and BiSrCaCuO and YBaCuO superconducting films were identified. Samples as small as 200 micrometers by 200 micrometers in size were generated, corresponding to library densities of 10,000 sites per square inch. The ability to generate and screen combinatorial libraries of solid-state compounds, when coupled with theory and empirical observations, may significantly increase the rate at which novel electronic, magnetic, and optical materials are discovered and theoretical predictions tested."
https://openalex.org/W2118957466,"Several types of microactuators have been fabricated, from simple paddles to self-assembling and -disassembling cubes. Conducting bilayers made of a layer of polymer and a layer of gold were used as hinges to connect rigid plates to each other and to a silicon substrate. The bending of the hinges was electrically controlled and reversible, allowing precise three-dimensional positioning of the plates. The structures were released from the substrate with a technique based on differential adhesion. This method, which avoids the use of a sacrificial layer and allows the actuators to pull themselves off the surface, may have general applications in micromachining. Possibilities include the manufacture, of surfaces whose light reflection or chemical properties can be switched."

The clean Pt{100} surface is reconstructed to a stable phase in which the surface layer of platinum atoms has a quasi-hexagonal structure. By comparison of the heats of adsorption of CO and of C2H4 on this stable Pt{100}-hex phase with those on a metastable Pt{100}-(1×1) surface, the energy difference between the two clean phases was measured as 20 ± 3 and 25 ± 3 kilojoules per mole of surface platinum atoms."

Experiments on samples of (Mg, Fe)SiO(3) show that silicate perovskite maintains its orthorhombic symmetry at 38 gigapascals and 1850 kelvin. Measurements at 65 and 70 gigapascals provide evidence for a temperature-induced orthorhombic-to-cubic phase transition and dissociation to an assemblage of perovskite and mixed oxides. If these phase transitions occur in Earth, they will require a significant change in mineralogical models of the lower mantle."

Furthermore, the largest feature seen in 1989, the Great Dark Spot, was gone. A dark spot of comparable size had appeared in the northern hemisphere, accompanied by discrete bright features at methane-band wavelengths. At visible wavelengths, Neptune's banded structure appeared similar to that seen in 1989."

https://openalex.org/W1986272535,"Since the last congress, held in 1916 in the midst of the racking uncertainties of the great war, notable events and serious calamities have befallen the world and arrested the attention of all thoughtful men. A bitter and passionate military contest has been brought to a hopeful conclusion; but because of the unparalleled cost of the struggle, in lives and in treasure, deep unrest, revolution even, starvation and disease are prevailing over a large part of Europe, while also within the three year period elapsed between the last congress and the present one three destructive epidemics of disease have ravaged the United States and the world. Hence it has seemed fitting to me that on this occasion and before this representative body of medical men we should pause for a brief period in order to review, as it were, our knowledge of epidemics and at the same time of the"

https://openalex.org/W1997321357,"(39, o05, I914), an account was published of a preliminary experiment to determine the rigidity of the earth. At that time it was announced that the experiment would be repeated, using an interference method. The new arrangements were completed and a new series of observations begun on November 20, 1916, and continued until November 20, 1917. The reduction of the observations was interrupted by the war in the summer of 1917 and could not be resumed until April 1919. The same pits and pipes on the grounds of the Yerkes Observatory at Williams Bay, Wisconsin, were used as in the preliminary experiment. In that experiment pipes 502 feet long and 6 inches in diameter were placed 6 feet underground. One pipe was laid accurately N-S and the other E-W. The pipes ended in pits io feet deep and 8 feet square, walled with concrete. The pipes were carefully leveled, and half filled with water, so that an air space extended from end to end of each pipe, above the water. The pipes ended in air-tight gauges provided with windows through which the changes in water-level could be determined by measuring with microscopes the distance between pointers just below the surface of the water and their totally reflected images."

However even that now seems optimistic. This article describes the scaled back proposal, which involves the Tokamak Physics Experiment and test reactor and the international Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, as well as the political manuvering surrounding fusion funding."

Participants unveiled new technologies that have sprung up on this common ground, such as an imaging technique that can gauge the chemical composition of materials. They also described ways to broaden that ground, such as a novel approach for integrating lasers and silicon chips-a challenge that has slowed progress toward a new generation of high-speed computers and communications."
