https://openalex.org/W3087611057,"We measured severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA concentrations in primary sewage sludge in the New Haven, Connecticut, USA, metropolitan area during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in Spring 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected throughout the more than 10-week study and, when adjusted for time lags, tracked the rise and fall of cases seen in SARS-CoV-2 clinical test results and local COVID-19 hospital admissions. Relative to these indicators, SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations in sludge were 0–2 d ahead of SARS-CoV-2 positive test results by date of specimen collection, 0–2 d ahead of the percentage of positive tests by date of specimen collection, 1–4 d ahead of local hospital admissions and 6–8 d ahead of SARS-CoV-2 positive test results by reporting date. Our data show the utility of viral RNA monitoring in municipal wastewater for SARS-CoV-2 infection surveillance at a population-wide level. In communities facing a delay between specimen collection and the reporting of test results, immediate wastewater results can provide considerable advance notice of infection dynamics. Testing sewage for the novel coronavirus reveals epidemiological trends."

We developed light-sensitive human retinal organoids with multiple nuclear and synaptic layers and functional synapses. We sequenced the RNA of 285,441 single cells from these organoids at seven developmental time points and from the periphery, fovea, pigment epithelium and choroid of light-responsive adult human retinas, and performed histochemistry. Cell types in organoids matured in vitro to a stable “developed” state at a rate similar to human retina development in vivo. Transcriptomes of organoid cell types converged toward the transcriptomes of adult peripheral retinal cell types. Expression of disease-associated genes was cell-type-specific in adult retina, and cell-type specificity was retained in organoids. We implicate unexpected cell types in diseases such as macular degeneration. This resource identifies cellular targets for studying disease mechanisms in organoids and for targeted repair in human retinas."

Naturally occurring psychedelics from plants as diverse as the mescaline-containing cactus Lophophora williamsii, the psilocybin-containing mushrooms Psilocybe sp., and the lysergamide-containing seeds from “Morning Glories” (Ipomoea sp.) have been reportedly used for millennia for religious purposes and shamanism (Nichols, 2016Nichols D.E. Psychedelics.Pharmacol. Rev. 2016; 68: 264-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, semi-synthetic hallucinogens like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and synthetic hallucinogens related to mescaline, including substituted amphetamines such as 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (Snyder et al., 1968Snyder S.H. Faillace L.A. Weingartner H. DOM (STP), a new hallucinogenic drug, and DOET: effects in normal subjects.Am. J. Psychiatry. 1968; 125: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), were available and used recreationally. More recently so-called “designer hallucinogens” with a scaffold related to N-benzyl-2,5-dimethoxy-phenethylamine (NBOMe) (Figure 1A) have become popular (Poulie et al., 2019Poulie C.B.M. Jensen A.A.

Of the NBOMe series, 25CN-NBOH is reported to be among the most potent and selective in vitro and in vivo (Fantegrossi et al., 2015Fantegrossi W.E. Gray B.W. Bailey J.M. Smith D.A. Hansen M.

Hallucinogens like psilocybin and LSD have been described to have potential therapeutic actions for many neuropsychiatric diseases (Nutt et al., 2020Nutt D. Erritzoe D. Carhart-Harris R. Psychedelic Psychiatry’s Brave New World.Cell. 2020; 181: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Psilocybin, for instance, has shown efficacy in two phase II clinical trials of depression and anxiety (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018Carhart-Harris R.L. Bolstridge M. Day C.M.J. Rucker J. Watts R.

Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2016; 30: 1165-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Remarkably, psilocybin’s effects appear to be both rapid and enduring (Carhart-Harris et al., 2018Carhart-Harris R.L. Bolstridge M. Day C.M.J. Rucker J. Watts R. Erritzoe D.E. Kaelen M. Giribaldi B.

Psychopharmacol. (Oxford). 2016; 30: 1181-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Likewise, LSD has been reported in pilot studies to have efficacy in cluster headaches (Sewell et al., 2006Sewell R.A. Halpern J.H. Pope Jr., H.G. Response of cluster headache to psilocybin and LSD.Neurology. 2006; 66: 1920-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), to alleviate anxiety in terminal illness (Gasser et al., 2015Gasser P.

(Oxford). 2015; 29: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and a number of uncontrolled and anecdotal reports have suggested its therapeutic actions in other neuropsychiatric disorders (Dos Santos et al., 2018Dos Santos R.G.

Although the precise mechanisms of action of hallucinogens remain largely unclear, 5-HT2A serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptor agonism is essential for their psychedelic effects in humans (Barrett et al., 2018Barrett F.S. Preller K.H. Herdener M. Janata P. Vollenweider F.X. Serotonin 2A Receptor Signaling Underlies LSD-induced Alteration of the Neural Response to Dynamic Changes in Music.Cereb.

Erritzoe D. Carhart-Harris R. Psychedelic Psychiatry’s Brave New World.Cell. 2020; 181: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The key to an understanding of psychedelic actions, then, is an appreciation of how they interact with and activate 5-HT2A serotonin receptors (HTR2A). To elucidate hallucinogen actions at the molecular level, we report here the active-state structure of 5-HT2A bound to 25CN-NBOH in complex with a mini-Gαq-βγ heterotrimer stabilized by a single-chain variable fragment (scFv16) obtained by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). For comparison, we also report X-ray structures of HTR2A complexed with the prototypical hallucinogen LSD and the inverse agonist methiothepin. Collectively, these results provide insights into how a model hallucinogen stabilizes a specific HTR2A transducer-coupled state. These findings should accelerate structure-guided efforts for discovering more selective HTR2A agonists with potential therapeutic activity for many neuropsychiatric diseases. For structural studies with a transducer-coupled HTR2A, we initially evaluated the HTR2A non-selective hallucinogen LSD (Kroeze et al., 2015Kroeze W.K. Sassano M.F. Huang X.P. Lansu K. McCorvy J.D. Giguère P.M. Sciaky N. Roth B.L. PRESTO-Tango as an open-source resource for interrogation of the druggable human GPCRome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and the HTR2A-selective agonist 25CN-NBOH (Fantegrossi et al., 2015Fantegrossi W.E. Gray B.W. Bailey J.M. Smith D.A. Hansen M. Kristensen J.L. Hallucinogen-like effects of 2-([2-(4-cyano-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl) ethylamino]methyl)phenol (25CN-NBOH), a novel N-benzylphenethylamine with 100-fold selectivity for 5-HT2A receptors, in mice.Psychopharmacology (Berl.). 2015; 232: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar; Hansen et al., 2014Hansen M. Phonekeo K. Paine J.S. Leth-Petersen S. Begtrup M. Bräuner-Osborne H. Kristensen J.L. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of N-benzyl phenethylamines as 5-HT2A/2C agonists.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2014; 5: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In preliminary experiments, we found that 25CN-NBOH provided more effective stabilization of the final complex than LSD (not shown). We used an engineered Gαq that was previously demonstrated to faithfully recapitulate wild-type Gαq-coupled G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation for several GPCRs, including HTR2A (Nehmé et al., 2017Nehmé R. Carpenter B. Singhal A. Strege A. Edwards P.C. White C.F. Du H. Grisshammer R. Tate C.G.

Nehmé R. Carpenter B. Tate C.G. Lambert N.A. Mini G protein probes for active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in live cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 7466-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, 35 amino acids at the N terminus of engineered mini-Gαq were replaced by the corresponding sequence in Gαi2 to facilitate binding of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv16) (Maeda et al., 2018Maeda S. Koehl A. Matile H. Hu H. Hilger D. Schertler G.F.X. Manglik A. Skiniotis G. Dawson R.J.P. Kobilka B.K. Development of an antibody fragment that stabilizes GPCR/G-protein complexes.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3712Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), thereby further stabilizing the HTR2A-Gαq protein complex for structural studies (Figure S1). An analogous approach was recently used to obtain a structure of the M1-muscarinic receptor complexed with Gα11 (Maeda et al., 2019Maeda S. Qu Q. Robertson M.J. Skiniotis G. Kobilka B.K. Structures of the M1 and M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor/G-protein complexes.Science. 2019; 364: 552-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To verify the functionality of the complex we performed bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET 1 and 2) (see Olsen et al., 2020Olsen R.H.J. DiBerto J.F. English J.G. Glaudin A.M. Krumm B.E. Slocum S.T. Che T. Gavin A.C. McCorvy J.D. Roth B.L. Strachan R.T. TRUPATH, an open-source biosensor platform for interrogating the GPCR transducerome.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2020; 16: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar for details) (Figure 1D) studies similar to those previously reported (Wan et al., 2018Wan Q. Okashah N. Inoue A. Nehmé R. Carpenter B. Tate C.G. Lambert N.A. Mini G protein probes for active G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in live cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 7466-7473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), which revealed that the functional activity of this engineered mini-Gαq construct is comparable to the wild-type Gαq (Figure 1E; Table S4). The studies also showed that 25CN-NBOH was the most efficacious agonist tested in our Gαq BRET recruitment assays (Figure 1F; Table S4). To improve the expression of HTR2A, parts of the N- and C-terminal of HTR2A were truncated and then cloned into a pFASTBac 1 vector (Figure S1A). To obtain a stable complex of HTR2A-Gαq, the sequences of the engineered GαqiN, Gβ1, and Gγ2 were integrated into a pFast dual expression vector to afford simultaneous expression of all three components and pre-formation of the GαqiN-Gβ1-Gγ2 heterotrimer (Figure S1B). We expressed HTR2A and G protein complex (GαqiN-Gβ1-Gγ2) in sf9 insect cells and purified them individually. The full complex of HTR2A-GαqiN-Gβ1-Gγ2 was then assembled in the presence of the agonist 25CN-NBOH and further stabilized by the single-chain antibody scFv16 (Figures S1C and S1D). The structure of G protein-coupled HTR2A complexed with 25CN-NBOH was determined by single-particle cryo-EM at a global nominal resolution of 3.27 Å, enabling near-atomic resolution modeling of the complex (Figures 1A and S1; Table S1). The 25CN-NBOH pose was further confirmed and validated through the GemSpot pipeline (Robertson et al., 2020Robertson M.J. van Zundert G.C.P. Borrelli K. Skiniotis G. GemSpot: A Pipeline for Robust Modeling of Ligands into Cryo-EM Maps.Structure. 2020; 28: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and was virtually identical to the pose predicted by independent molecular docking studies (Figures S6E and S6F). The overall structure of 25CN-NBOH-stabilized HTR2A-Gαq/β1/γ2 structure is consistent with the fully active-state receptor conformation that has been observed in several other GPCRs bound to a G-protein ternary complex (Weis and Kobilka, 2018Weis W.I. Kobilka B.K. The Molecular Basis of G Protein-Coupled Receptor Activation.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2018; 87: 897-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). We found that scFv16 binds to the crevice between the αN helix of mini-GαqiN and the β-propeller of Gβ1 similar to that observed in the MOR-Gαi complex (Koehl et al., 2018Koehl A. Hu H. Maeda S. Zhang Y. Qu Q. Paggi J.M. Latorraca N.R. Hilger D. Dawson R. Matile H. et al.Structure of the µ-opioid receptor-G i protein complex.Nature. 2018; 558: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), thereby providing additional stabilization of the complex (Figure S1E). To obtain a more thorough understanding of how hallucinogens might interact with HTR2A, we determined crystal structures of two HTR2A-ligand complexes. LSD is the prototypical hallucinogen that exerts effects its psychedelic primarily via HTR2A (Nichols, 2016Nichols D.E. Psychedelics.Pharmacol. Rev. 2016; 68: 264-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), and we previously reported the structure of the 5-HT2B (HTR2B) receptor complexed with LSD (Wacker et al., 2017bWacker D. Wang S.

Biol. 2018; 25: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These structures provided important insights into mechanisms of biased agonism at HTR2B (McCorvy et al., 2018McCorvy J.D. Wacker D.

Venkatakrishnan A.J. Levit A. Lansu K. Schools Z.L. Che T. Nichols D.E. et al.Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor.Cell. 2017; 168: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To obtain a better understanding of the actions of LSD on HTR2A, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of HTR2A complexed with LSD (Figure 1B), and, for comparison, the potent inverse agonist methiothepin (Figure 1C; Table S2). Both structures were obtained at 3.4 Å resolution using an identical HTR2A construct with apocytochrome b562RIL (BRIL) fused to the third intracellular loop 3 (ICL3) of the receptor and two thermostabilizing HTR2A mutations (L247A5.51 and L371A7.44) (Figures S2A–S2D). Binding assays showed that this engineered construct maintained WT ligand-binding affinities (Figure S2E). The asymmetric unit (ASU) contains three molecules, and crystal contacts are mediated by TM1, TM4, and H8 (Figure S2F). The superposition of these three molecules shows that the orientation of the receptors is nearly identical, although slight differences are observed in the BRIL fusion protein. We focused on HTR2A molecule “chain A” for subsequent analysis (Figure S2G). The electron density maps for LSD and methiothepin were well resolved (Figure S2H). The overall differences between LSD bound to HTR2A and the previous LSD-HTR2B structure are relatively subtle, as predicted (Wacker et al., 2017bWacker D. Wang S. McCorvy J.D. Betz R.M. Venkatakrishnan A.J. Levit A. Lansu K. Schools Z.L. Che T. Nichols D.E. et al.Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor.Cell. 2017; 168: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In the HTR2B/LSD structure, ECL2 forms a “lid” over LSD, prolonging LSD’s residence time (Wacker et al., 2017bWacker D. Wang S. McCorvy J.D. Betz R.M. Venkatakrishnan A.J. Levit A. Lansu K.

In confirmation of our prior mutagenesis, kinetic, and molecular modeling studies (Wacker et al., 2017bWacker D. Wang S. McCorvy J.D. Betz R.M. Venkatakrishnan A.J. Levit A. Lansu K. Schools Z.L. Che T. Nichols D.E. et al.Crystal Structure of an LSD-Bound Human Serotonin Receptor.Cell. 2017; 168: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), we find that ECL2 in the LSD-HTR2A complex is located in a similar position, occluding LSD (Figure 2A). Using a previously described constitutively active HTR2A mutant (Shapiro et al., 2002Shapiro D.A. Kristiansen K. Weiner D.M. Kroeze W.K. Roth B.L. Evidence for a model of agonist-induced activation of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors which involves the disruption of a strong ionic interaction between helices 3 and 6.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11441-11449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we found that methiothepin (a non-selective serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptor antagonist) was a potent and efficacious HTR2A inverse agonist (Figure S2I). Methiothepin’s binding pose in HTR2A displays unique features that are detailed below. With these available structures in hand, we first assessed the overall conformational rearrangements between the inactive and active state structures. A surface view from the extracellular side also shows that the Gαq-coupled state is considerably more open than the LSD-bound state (Figures 2A–2C). We calculated the size of the ligand-binding pockets for all three structures using the CASTp 3.0 server (Tian et al., 2018Tian W. Chen C. Lei X. Zhao J. Liang J. CASTp 3.0: computed atlas of surface topography of proteins.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: W363-W367Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) and found that the solvent-accessible volumes of the ligand-binding pockets were 188.1 A3 for methiothepin, 153.1 A3 for LSD, and 287.0 A3 for 25CN-NBOH (Figure 2D; Table S3).

We discuss benefits of mapping a mouse brain at the level of synapses. In April 2019, the great molecular biologist Sydney Brenner died at the age of 92. Among his many accomplishments was a radical experiment: might it be possible to obtain the complete wiring diagram of an animal’s nervous system by serially sectioning it into many exceedingly thin slices, imaging each of these sections at high resolution with an electron microscope (EM), and painstakingly tracing each neuron’s branches and synaptic connections with other neurons? This audacious idea became reality in 1986 when Brenner, John White, and several other extraordinary scientists produced a 340 page magnum opus, “The Structure of the Nervous System of the Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans” (with the running head “The Mind of a Worm”) for the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society (White et al., 1986White J.G. Southgate E. Thomson J.N. Brenner S. The structure of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 314: 1-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Brenner was interested in the relation between genes and behavior and wondered if behavioral mutants of this small worm might be explained by alterations in the structure of its nervous system. Such a strategy might be used to harvest principles of neural organization that underlie behavior. This work was ahead of its time. Computers, although tried, were not of much use: digital image processing was inadequate to the task, and as a consequence, everything was done by manual effort. Nonetheless, the result was a great accomplishment. One testament to its value is that this paper has been cited thousands of times, and in almost every year since its publication 33 years ago, the number of citations has increased. In addition to “The Mind of a Worm,” Brenner’s legacy has been the birth of the connectomics discipline, in which researchers in systems neuroscience, applied physics, and computer science have begun to collaborate on more automated and computer-assisted approaches to untangle ever-larger nervous systems. Efforts to reconstruct complete wiring diagrams of invertebrates and non-mammalian vertebrate nervous systems are now underway (Hildebrand et al., 2017Hildebrand D.G.C. Cicconet M. Torres R.M.

The advantage of the volumetric EM reconstruction approach is that it provides an unbiased rendering of every cellular and subcellular structure in the nervous system. In the fly, more than 40 papers have presented novel findings based on connectomics. Each work is a detailed analysis with new discoveries, and, in toto, they contain the most detailed atlas of a nervous system ever assembled. These data are generating many hypotheses that are already being put to the test with new experiments. In areas of the fly brain that have seen particularly intense connectomic study, such as the mushroom body, central complex, and visual system, it is increasingly difficult to envision studies that ignore the insights generated by studying their connectomes. This recent progress raises the question of what the payoff would be to scale up whole-brain connectomics substantially to tackle nervous systems closer to our own. This question arises at a propitious moment. The advisory committee to the NIH Director for the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) 2.0 Initiative has released an assessment of the progress in the BRAIN Initiative. In it, the advisory committee (which includes authors C.D., A.L.F., J.H.R.M., B.R.R., and D.T.) identifies mapping a whole mouse brain connectome as a transformative project “to apply new and emerging tools to revolutionize our understanding of brain circuits.” This project would be orders of magnitude larger than any previous connectome project (see Figure 1) and probably would be the largest project (if measured by data size) ever attempted in biology. Roughly 1 million terabytes of data will need to be acquired and analyzed to provide a complete mouse brain connectome that includes all interareal projections and all synaptic connections. Importantly, this project will require a consortium of academic, philanthropic, and corporate partners working in close cooperation. To be sure, this project will be an immense challenge. Many technical hurdles will need to be overcome such as uniform osmium staining of nearly a cubic centimeter of brain tissue, lossless sectioning and imaging of that volume at nanometer resolution, sufficient speed via parallelization to complete the map in years as opposed to decades, and scaling up the many essential computational methods that will need to be deployed. This effort will have a high price tag, likely to be hundreds of millions of dollars; although, once the infrastructure is in place, subsequent connectomes would be vastly less expensive. Perhaps the greatest, and most interesting, challenges will manifest only after the connectome is completed. For example, any mouse connectome will inevitably be unique; even isogenic worms have substantial inter-animal variations in their connectomes (Hall and Russell, 1991Hall D.H. Russell R.L. The posterior nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans: serial reconstruction of identified neurons and complete pattern of synaptic interactions.J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1-22Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Witvliet et al., 2020Witvliet D. Mulcahy B. Mitchell J.K. Meirovitch Y. Berger D.R. Wu Y. Liu Y. Koh W.X. Parvathala R.

Understanding statistical regularities and learning which variations are stochastic and which are secondary to an animal’s life history will help define the substrate upon which individuality rests and require comparisons between circuit maps within and between animals. Indeed, making sense of something as complex as the mammalian brain will be a supreme challenge and will require the development of novel theoretical and analytical approaches. There are many reasons that mapping the mouse connectome is both timely and important, some of which are described below. A nanometer-resolution image database and reconstructed connectome of a mouse brain will at a minimum provide (1) a complete census of anatomical cell types in the mouse brain, including their detailed morphology and some aspects of subcellular composition, (2) upstream and downstream synaptic partners for all neurons, including the precise long range targets of each axon, and (3) structural parameters of each synapse, such as bouton size and vesicle counts, that have been found to correlate with physiological parameters (Holler-Rickauer et al., 2019Holler-Rickauer S. Köstinger G. Martin K.A.C. Schuhknecht G.F.P. Stratford K.J. Structure and function of a neocortical synapse.bioRxiv. 2019; https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.875971Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These data will lay the foundation of all future studies of circuit-scale rodent neurobiology and enrich their conclusions. Light microscopy has emerged as a powerful technology for whole mouse brain mapping and has been applied to reconstruct the complete axonal arbors of individual neurons (Winnubst et al., 2019Winnubst J. Bas E. Ferreira T.A. Wu Z. Economo M.N. Edson P. Arthur B.J. Bruns C. Rokicki K. Schauder D. et al.Reconstruction of 1,000 Projection Neurons Reveals New Cell Types and Organization of Long-Range Connectivity in the Mouse Brain.Cell. 2019; 179: 268-281.e13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). If a neuron’s axon enters a target brain region, the neuron is said to “project” to that region. The target region contains numerous neuronal cell types, and any given axon may prefer to make synaptic connections onto some types while avoiding others. Electron microscopy has sufficient resolving power to reveal connection preferences: for example, whether an axon has a bias for excitatory or for inhibitory cell types, or for the nearby apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons whose cell bodies reside in different cortical layers. Such distinctions have important functional consequences. A whole mouse brain connectome will reveal not only the targets of all axonal projections but also connection preferences of axons within their targets. We envision that this nanometer-scale mapping would be preceded by millimeter-scale mapping of the same mouse brain using non-invasive modalities like functional ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and diffusion MRI. Comparing both non-invasive and connectomic maps of the same mouse brain would enhance our understanding of the structural underpinnings of the signals measured by current non-invasive techniques, which are widely applied to the human brain. Individual mammalian animals (including and especially humans) generate a stable behavioral repertoire that is based in part on the particular experiences they have had. Experiences are known to alter connections between nerve cells (Kessels and Malinow, 2009Kessels H.W. Malinow R. Synaptic AMPA receptor plasticity and behavior.Neuron. 2009; 61: 340-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar), and in this sense, much information is likely stored in the particularities of an individual’s wiring diagram. This form of information storage is profoundly different from other types, such as hereditary information stored in DNA or digital information stored in computer memory, and much remains to be learned about it. The first complete mouse connectome will provide a baseline for comparisons; later work using the same brain mapping infrastructure will reveal aspects of neural circuits that are preserved from one animal to another, presumably based on inheritance, and importantly the ways in which connections vary between individuals, presumably based in part on different experiences. Understanding this variability likely holds a key to deciphering how experiences are stored in the brain, a profoundly interesting and important aspect of our own makeup. In contrast to most diseases in the rest of the body, common disorders altering brain function such as autism and schizophrenia (which affect more than 7 million Americans) are defined mainly by their behavioral symptoms and largely lack explanations based on underlying brain abnormalities. Hence treatments, such as they are, only mitigate the outward manifestations of the disorder rather than addressing underlying causes. This is an untenable situation: significant therapeutic breakthroughs are rare if the therapy is not focused on the root causes. Encouraging progress is being made in identifying genetic underpinnings (Chen et al., 2015Chen J.A. Peñagarikano O. Belgard T.G. Swarup V. Geschwind D.H. The emerging picture of autism spectrum disorder: genetics and pathology.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2015; 10: 111-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Genes and environmental influences likely lead to neuropathologies that could be proximate causes of autism and schizophrenia (Chen et al., 2015Chen J.A. Peñagarikano O. Belgard T.G. Swarup V. Geschwind D.H. The emerging picture of autism spectrum disorder: genetics and pathology.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2015; 10: 111-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For most diseases, pathology (the study of diseased tissues, often with microscopy) has played a central role because it provides strong clues about proximate causes. This is immensely more challenging in the brain because normal function is based on a vast number of interconnected neuronal branches. Neurons (especially their axons) extend for long distances through a thick volume, and therefore it is impossible to see a complete neuron in a single brain section, much less an entire circuit that may be abnormal in a disease. This may help explain why many disorders of brain function show no clear-cut pathological changes. Presumably, it is not that brain disorders occur without pathology but rather that the traditional tools used in pathology are inadequate. Apprehending complete brain circuits requires the use of connectomic imaging approaches over large volumes to trace out small neuronal branches and their synapses. Wiring disorders surely account for at least some chronic disorders of brain function. Where might we get early insights into such “connectopathies”? The mouse is an excellent animal model for studying abnormal brain connectivity because there are many mouse models of a wide range of brain disorders (Del Pino et al., 2018Del Pino I. Rico B. Marín O. Neural circuit dysfunction in mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2018; 48: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The mouse has many organizational characteristics found in the human nervous system, and we believe it is technically feasible to map the complete mouse connectome (but not the complete human connectome) in the near future. The brains of all mammals contain many of the same cortical and subcortical regions, interareal projections, and connectional organization within regions. Therefore, one can learn a lot about normal human brain organization from the normal mouse brain and obtain insights into human diseases from mouse models. The first step would be to learn what the normal wiring diagram is, and that is what a mouse connectome would achieve. Importantly, once the connectomics infrastructure is set up at the scale required to map a whole mouse brain, it should be feasible to do many additional connectomes (intra-areal and whole brain) of animal models of brain disorders, including non-human primate models such as the marmoset and macaque, which more closely resemble the human. In this way the nascent field of connectopathology, which currently focuses mainly on human neuroimaging (Rubinov and Bullmore, 2013Rubinov M. Bullmore E. Schizophrenia and abnormal brain network hubs.Dialogues Clin. Neurosci. 2013; 15: 339-349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Van Essen and Barch, 2015Van Essen D.C. Barch D.M. The human connectome in health and psychopathology.World Psychiatry. 2015; 14: 154-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), would synergize more strongly with animal models, with the hope of putting the etiologies of psychiatric and developmental brain disorders on a firmer footing. Seventy-five years ago, the neuroscientist and mathematician duo McCulloch and Pitts proposed that simple model neurons could be wired together in specific ways to compute interesting functions—a brain-inspired concept which underlies the artificial neural networks that dominate much of today’s work in artificial intelligence (AI) (McCulloch and Pitts, 1943McCulloch W.S. Pitts W. A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity.Bull. Math. Biophys. 1943; 5: 115-133Crossref Scopus (8112) Google Scholar). Sixty years ago, Nobel prize-winning neuroscientists Hubel and Wiesel identified “simple” and “complex” cells in cat visual cortex that AI pioneers subsequently interpreted as operating as a “convolutional neural network,” a visual processing architecture that has proven to be an extraordinarily successful and economically important invention in modern computing. Neuroscience has thus already had a profound impact on the development of AI. But what will the mouse connectome specifically offer AI engineers and computer scientists? We describe several of the most important possibilities: 1. A blueprint for cognitive computing systems. AI researchers have been successful in steadily improving systems with fairly narrow competencies such as classifying images, playing board games, or transcribing speech. There has been a notable lack of success in creating computer systems that combine diverse capabilities into a generally capable intelligence that rivals the flexibility of biological intelligence. One likely reason for this is the absence of compelling principles or theories that could guide the design of such an integrative system. Studying biological intelligence offers an alternative path forward: in the mammalian brain, nature has evolved a general architecture found in all mammals including humans that provides varying degrees of intelligence. This solution is implemented in organisms whose brains span five orders of magnitude in size, while achieving astonishing feats of multi-modal sensorimotor integration, perception, planning, reasoning, prediction, and memory. The mouse connectome will provide a comprehensive description of brain-wide synapse level communication pathways and circuit motifs that underpin the fundamental principles of biological intelligence and may guide us to the construction of integrative AI systems with comparable attributes. 2. A blueprint for data-efficient learning. Hallmarks of human and animal learning are profound capabilities in (1) “unsupervised learning,” which enables adaptation to environmental circumstances in the absence of specific “labels” or other instructions, and (2) “few shot learning,” which enables generalization from just a few examples of a stimulus or phenomenon. In contrast, today’s AI systems often require millions or billions of human-labeled data points in order to perform a useful task. As mentioned earlier, the acquisition of wiring diagrams across multiple individuals will yield insights into how experiences shape neural connections. Such insights into the principles behind biological learning could lead to new algorithms for effective unsupervised and few-shot learning, complementing ongoing efforts by AI researchers. 3. A blueprint for energy-efficient computing. Supercomputers that today struggle to reproduce mouse-level intelligence occupy football-field sized buildings and consume megawatts of energy. Clearly, we have much to learn from biology about efficient computing. There are many differences between brains and computers including the complexity of the components, the degree of parallel processing (much greater in brains), the flow of electricity across, as well as along, fine neural branches, and the combination of chemical and electrical signaling. A mouse connectome will provide a detailed plan of how an efficient computing machine is implemented in nature and thus accelerate progress toward energy-efficient AI. The mammalian brain is probably the most impressive intelligent system in the natural world with our own brain being at the top of the heap. However, despite our intelligence and centuries of inquiry, we still have a paltry sense of how it works. What we do know is that the complex patterns of synaptic connectivity are almost certainly at the heart of its function. It is now time to gain access to these neural circuits and analyze them. For technical reasons, mapping a mouse brain is at present far more feasible than a human one, but even a mouse connectome will be a supreme challenge. Only a unified effort, at the frontiers of technological capability, can ultimately provide such a dataset. We have outlined several fundamental areas of science that are likely to advance from studying such data, including the description of the brain in terms of its cell types, the structural basis of memories, a better understanding of brain disease, and principles of biological intelligence. However, like genomes and large-scale cosmological surveys, which led to discoveries that were largely unexplainable in a previous era of investigation, we predict that a whole-brain mammalian connectome will generate entirely new and unanticipated questions about the nervous system and perhaps represent a turning point in the pursuit of understanding what makes us the unique animals that we are."
https://openalex.org/W3086698680,"In response to skeletal muscle contraction during exercise, paracrine factors coordinate tissue remodeling, which underlies this healthy adaptation. Here we describe a pH-sensing metabolite signal that initiates muscle remodeling upon exercise. In mice and humans, exercising skeletal muscle releases the mitochondrial metabolite succinate into the local interstitium and circulation. Selective secretion of succinate is facilitated by its transient protonation, which occurs upon muscle cell acidification. In the protonated monocarboxylic form, succinate is rendered a transport substrate for monocarboxylate transporter 1, which facilitates pH-gated release. Upon secretion, succinate signals via its cognate receptor SUCNR1 in non-myofibrillar cells in muscle tissue to control muscle-remodeling transcriptional programs. This succinate-SUCNR1 signaling is required for paracrine regulation of muscle innervation, muscle matrix remodeling, and muscle strength in response to exercise training. In sum, we define a bioenergetic sensor in muscle that utilizes intracellular pH and succinate to coordinate tissue adaptation to exercise."
https://openalex.org/W3087286627,"Wheat blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae pathotype Triticum (MoT) is a threat to wheat production especially in the warmer-humid environments. In Zambia, wheat blast symptoms were observed for the first time on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in experimental plots and five farmers' fields in Mpika district of Muchinga Province during the 2017-18 rainy season. Infected plants showed the typical wheat blast symptoms with the spike becoming partially or completely bleached with the blackening of the rachis in a short span of time. Incidence of blast symptoms on nearly all wheat heads was high and ranged from 50 to 100%. Examination of diseased plant leaves showed the presence of elliptical, grayish to tan necrotic lesions with dark borders on the leaf often mixed with other foliar diseases. A study was conducted to isolate and identify the causal pathogen(s) using classical and molecular methods and determine the pathogenicity of the detected disease causal agent. Morphobiometrical determination of causal pathogen revealed conidia with characteristic pear shaped 2-septate hyaline spores associated with M. oryzae species. Preliminary polymerase chain reaction screening of six isolates obtained from wheat blast infected samples with diagnostic primers (MoT3F/R) was conducted at ZARI, Zambia, and subsequent analysis of two isolates with MoT3F/R and C17F/R was performed at USDA-ARS, USA. Both experiments confirmed that MoT is the causal agent of wheat blast in Zambia. Further, pathogenicity tests performed with pure culture isolates from samples WS4 and WS5 produced typical blast symptoms on all the six inoculated wheat genotypes.

https://openalex.org/W3070427138,"Every day we make decisions critical for adaptation and survival. We repeat actions with known consequences. But we also draw on loosely related events to infer and imagine the outcome of entirely novel choices. These inferential decisions are thought to engage a number of brain regions; however, the underlying neuronal computation remains unknown. Here, we use a multi-day cross-species approach in humans and mice to report the functional anatomy and neuronal computation underlying inferential decisions. We show that during successful inference, the mammalian brain uses a hippocampal prospective code to forecast temporally structured learned associations. Moreover, during resting behavior, coactivation of hippocampal cells in sharp-wave/ripples represent inferred relationships that include reward, thereby ""joining-the-dots"" between events that have not been observed together but lead to profitable outcomes. Computing mnemonic links in this manner may provide an important mechanism to build a cognitive map that stretches beyond direct experience, thus supporting flexible behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3087565842,"Hippocampal spiking sequences encode external stimuli and spatiotemporal intervals, linking sequential experiences in memory, but the dynamics controlling the emergence and stability of such diverse representations remain unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in CA1 while mice performed an olfactory working-memory task, we recorded stimulus-specific sequences of ""odor-cells"" encoding olfactory stimuli followed by ""time-cells"" encoding time points in the ensuing delay. Odor-cells were reliably activated and retained stable fields during changes in trial structure and across days. Time-cells exhibited sparse and dynamic fields that remapped in both cases. During task training, but not in untrained task exposure, time-cell ensembles increased in size, whereas odor-cell numbers remained stable. Over days, sequences drifted to new populations with cell activity progressively converging to a field and then diverging from it. Therefore, CA1 employs distinct regimes to encode external cues versus their variable temporal relationships, which may be necessary to construct maps of sequential experiences."

A neural microcircuit model for a scalable scale-invariant representation of time.Hippocampus. 2019; 29: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, the potential computational significance of these different regimes remains unclear. In particular, what is the potential computational tradeoff of encoding time through the progressive activation of neurons (a neural sequence), approximately linear changes in firing rate, or complex neural trajectories in which any given neuron can exhibit multiple peaks in activity? Answering this question has been hampered by challenges in rigorously quantifying and comparing different dynamical regimes across different brain areas. For example, while it is often the case that neural trajectories appear sequence like when sorted appropriately, the degree of sequentiality is rarely quantified—e.g., the overlap of the temporal fields of consecutively active neurons (related to the temporal sparsity) or the presence of additional secondary peaks is often not taken into account. Some of the brain areas that have consistently been implicated in timing exhibit fundamentally different circuit motifs; for example, while premotor areas are characterized by the presence of robust recurrent excitation, striatal circuits lack recurrent excitation (Shepherd, 1998Shepherd G.M. The Synaptic Organization of the Brain..Fourth Edition. Oxford University, 1998Google Scholar). The functional and computational consequences of these different circuit motifs for the encoding of time remain unexplored. Here, we explicitly contrasted the dynamics of dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and secondary motor cortex (M2) during a two-interval timing task. We developed novel measures to quantify the sequentiality of the dynamics and whether neural activity undergoes temporal scaling from the short to long intervals. We found that the DLS exhibits more sequential dynamics, which provide a more flexible regime for downstream areas to read out time in a biologically plausible manner. These findings suggest a previously unknown computational role for the striatum in timing and provide general insights into which type of dynamical regimes are optimal for reading out temporal information in downstream brain areas. We compared simultaneously recorded neural dynamics in M2 and DLS, as head-fixed mice performed a two-interval timing task (n = 8). Animals were randomly presented with one of two olfactory cues for 0.2 s. A reward was delivered with a 3 s (cue 1, short interval) or 6 s delay (cue 2, long interval) if mice withheld licking for the first 1.5 s after cue 1 onset, or 3 s after cue 2 onset (Figure 1A). Mice learned to differentially time the onset of their anticipatory licking in response to the cues (Figures 1B–1D). The mean and standard deviation of the lick onset time were both significantly higher for the long interval cue (Figures 1E and 1F). We next used silicon microprobes to simultaneously record spiking activity from neurons in M2 and DLS, as well-trained mice performed the task (range of isolated units: 81–263 in M2, 157–288 in DLS, Figures 2A and 2B ). To confirm that, if as reported previously, population dynamics in M2 and DLS encode elapsed time, we decoded time from the population activity on a trial-by-trial basis using a supervised decoder (see STAR Methods). For both short- and long-interval trials, we found a similar decoding performance between M2 and DLS (Figures S1A–S1C). Furthermore, since these areas are also associated with motor performance, we confirmed that the animals’ lick onset time could be decoded with similar accuracy from each area (Figures S1D and S1E). These results demonstrate that the neural dynamics in both areas can encode two different temporal intervals but do not address whether both areas use similar encoding schemes. To attempt to rigorously quantify the potential differences in dynamics in both areas, we introduced a novel sequentiality index (SqI) bounded between 0 and 1 (see STAR Methods). Two aspects of neural dynamics were factored into computing SqI (Figures 2C–2G): first, the entropy of the distribution of peak firing times across the population—which captures whether the entire interval is homogeneously “tiled” by the peak firing times of neurons— and, second, a measure of temporal sparsity—which captures how much of the activity at each point in time can be attributed to a single neuron. Interestingly, for both delay intervals, SqI was significantly higher in DLS relative to M2 (Figure 2E). This difference appeared to be primarily due to a higher temporal sparsity of DLS dynamics (Figures 2F and 2G). Given that both areas encoded time but exhibited significant differences in neural dynamics, a critical question is how the neural dynamics observed during the short- and long-delay trials are related. Specifically, whether the response profile scaled from the short- to the long-delay trials, or if neurons had the same absolute temporal profile in response to both cues (Murakami et al., 2014Murakami M. Vicente M.I. Costa G.M. Mainen Z.F. Neural antecedents of self-initiated actions in secondary motor cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 1574-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar; Mello et al., 2015Mello G.B.M. Soares S. Paton J.J. A scalable population code for time in the striatum.Curr.

Flexible timing by temporal scaling of cortical responses.Nat. Neurosci. 2018; 21: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To address this question, we first examined how well a decoder trained on the short trials could predict either absolute time (from 0 to 3 s) or scaled (normalized) time during long trials. While cross-performance was significantly worse under both conditions, the scaled condition was significantly better than the absolute (Figure S1C). Furthermore, cross-sorted neurograms suggested significant spatial differences during short and long delays, albeit with some shared early sensory and late motor responses (Figures S1F and S1G). We next developed an absolute-scaling index (ASI; Figure S2) to quantify whether each unit’s activity during both cues is more consistent with an absolute (ASI = 1) or scaling (ASI = 0) property. While a sizable population of cells scaled their responses within the cue-reward interval, other units exhibited a similar temporal profile in response to both cues. The mean ASI, however, was not significantly different between M2 and DLS, suggesting a comparable mixture of temporally scaled and non-scaled response types in both areas. Experimental and computational studies have suggested that sequential dynamics observed in numerous brain areas underlies timing (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H.R. Kozhevnikov A.A. Fee M.S.

Learning multiple variable-speed sequences in striatum via cortical tutoring.eLife. 2017; 6: e26084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the potential computational benefit of using neural sequences over other dynamical regimes to encode time has not been addressed. We hypothesized that neural sequences provide a flexible dynamical regime that can be easily read out by downstream areas utilizing biologically plausible learning rules. First, in contrast to the sophisticated machine learning approaches that can perform optimal decoding, biological networks likely rely on simple associative learning rules such as STDP and LTP to decode time. Second, since the projecting neurons of any given area are generally all excitatory or inhibitory, any set of first-order downstream units should at first pass decode time using a complement of positive (or negative) weights. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the ability of hypothetical downstream units to read out time from the experimentally observed dynamics of M2 and DLS. Based on the dynamics in M2 and DLS, five output units were trained to produce five delays, while only allowing non-negative weights onto the output units (Figure 3A). Consistent with the higher SqI in DLS, outputs trained on DLS dynamics during both the short and long intervals were significantly better at producing the target delays, with performance quantified as the correlation coefficient between the generated and target trajectories (Figures 3B and 3C). These regional differences were robust to a range of upper weight values and target trajectory numbers used in the model (Figure S3). Importantly, the enhanced DLS performance was not due to higher activity in this area, and these findings remained unchanged when the analysis was confined to significantly responsive cells (Figure S4). To further understand why dynamics with higher sequentiality (i.e., DLS compared to M2) provided the downstream units a better regime to read out time, we contrasted a wide range of prototypical experimentally observed regimes, includes families of neural sequences (Hahnloser et al., 2002Hahnloser R.H.R.

Neurosci. 2017; 37: 854-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), as well as a high-dimensional periodic basis function. Together, these prototypical regimes exhibited a wide spectrum of sequentiality as measured by their SqI (Figure 4A). Each regime was used as the input to a set of downstream units that were trained to produce five delays using the same constraints as those in Figure 3. Compared to other patterns, e.g., ramping, periodic, or complex (multi-peaked) patterns, sequential trajectories provided the best performance (Figure 4B). Quantification of this effect revealed a positive correlation of performance with the SqI of different regimes (Figure 4C). This result can be understood in terms of the set of basis functions that each dynamical regime provides for downstream neurons to extract temporal information through a weighted linear combination of each unit. In the extreme, neural sequences offer a quasi-orthogonal set of basis functions to read out time. And importantly, in contrast to other near orthogonal basis sets, sequences can be read out using only non-negative weights. Orthogonal bases provide a larger domain from which to generate a target vector. Indeed, the model performance and SqI positively correlated with the average paired angle between all the units in a given dynamical regime (Figures 4D and 4E). Previous studies have reported neural codes for elapsed time in both M2 and DLS (Merchant et al., 2013bMerchant H. Pérez O. Zarco W. Gámez J.

Consistent with these previous results, we observed a distributed code for elapsed time in both areas during a two-interval timing task. Specifically, using traditional decoders elapsed time was decoded equally well in M2 and DLS on a trial-by-trial basis. Interestingly, however, dynamical regimes in DLS and M2 exhibited different signatures: the dynamics in DLS was more sequential and provided a better set of basis functions for downstream areas to read out time in a biologically plausible manner. Importantly, M2 sends a strong excitatory projection to the DLS, which plays a role in driving striatal activity during reward-conditioned behavior (Lee et al., 2019Lee K. Bakhurin K.I. Claar L.D. Holley S.M. Chong N.C. Cepeda C. Levine M.S. Masmanidis S.C. Gain Modulation by Corticostriatal and Thalamostriatal Input Signals during Reward-Conditioned Behavior.Cell Rep. 2019; 29: 2438-2449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the mutually inhibitory circuit motifs of the striatum are optimizing cortical dynamics for downstream areas to read out time (Burke et al., 2017Burke D.A. Rotstein H.G. Alvarez V.A. Striatal Local Circuitry: A New Framework for Lateral Inhibition.Neuron. 2017; 96: 267-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We propose that neural sequences can provide a quasi-orthogonal set of basis functions for downstream areas to read out time in a biologically plausible manner. The biological constraints include the fact that the projecting neurons in a given area are either excitatory (e.g., cortex) or inhibitory (e.g., striatum); thus, first-order downstream neurons generally receive only excitatory or inhibitory weights from a given area. Additionally, in contrast to the machine learning and Bayesian decoder methods often used to demonstrate the encoding of elapsed time, downstream biological networks are likely to rely on simple associative forms of synaptic plasticity. These constraints can severely limit the ability of downstream neurons to effectively read out time. Here, we showed that when biological constraints are taken into account, neural sequences provide a superior dynamical regime to encode time, compared to ramps and complex spatiotemporal patterns. But we stress, that many of the dynamic regimes considered (Figure 4), including linear and exponential ramping, can drive complex temporal patterns when using more sophisticated decoding schemes, or by allowing positive and negative weights (Shankar and Howard, 2012Shankar K.H. Howard M.W. A scale-invariant internal representation of time.Neural Comput. 2012; 24: 134-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar; Liu et al., 2019Liu Y. Tiganj Z. Hasselmo M.E. Howard M.W. A neural microcircuit model for a scalable scale-invariant representation of time.Hippocampus. 2019; 29: 260-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). More generally, however, the quasi-orthogonality of neural sequences is advantageous because in the extreme it resembles the coordinate system of neuron space (e.g., neuron’s activity vector over time is composed of 0 s and a single 1). And this standard coordinate system provides the only set of orthogonal basis functions that does not require negative values. Indeed, the advantage of sparse neural sequences has been previously noted in a bird song model showing that increased temporal sparsity decreases learning time (Fiete et al., 2004Fiete I.R. Hahnloser R.H.R. Fee M.S. Seung H.S. Temporal sparseness of the premotor drive is important for rapid learning in a neural network model of birdsong.J. Neurophysiol. 2004; 92: 2274-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results help clarify a large body of diverse experimental data regarding temporal processing and raise the hypothesis that some of the local computations performed by different areas might be best understood not simply as encoding time but optimizing the code. Specifically, a large body of data has suggested a pivotal role for the striatum in timing in the range of seconds and that time is encoded in dynamically changing spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity (Buhusi and Meck, 2005Buhusi C.V. Meck W.H. What makes us tick? Functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar; Merchant et al., 2013aMerchant H.

Buonomano D.V. The Neural Basis of Timing: Distributed Mechanisms for Diverse Functions.Neuron. 2018; 98: 687-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Yet it remains unknown whether the striatum should be considered a timer per se—in the sense that it actively generates the appropriate dynamics or is simply “propagating” the spatiotemporal patterns of input it receives. Our results are consistent with the suggestion that, while the DLS might not generate the neural dynamics that underlies timing, it may optimize the dynamics by creating neural sequences that are ideally suited for downstream areas to generate timed patterns.

Male C57BL/6J mice (n = 8, 14 – 20 weeks old at the time of recording (The Jackson Laboratory #000664) were used in this study. Animals were kept on a 12-h light cycle, and group housed until the first stereotaxic surgery. All procedures were approved by the University of California, Los Angeles Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee. Animals underwent an initial head bar implantation surgery under isoflurane anesthesia in a stereotaxic apparatus (model 1900; Kopf Instruments) to fix stainless steel head restraint bars bilaterally on the skull with dental cement. Animals recovered for at least one week before starting behavioral training. Animals underwent a second surgery under isoflurane anesthesia on the day prior to recording, to make craniotomies for silicon microprobe insertion in M2 and DLS. An additional craniotomy was made over the posterior cerebellum for placement of an electrical reference wire. Animals were individual"

Current commercially available implantable devices that allow for recording and stimulation of deep brain activity in humans can provide invaluable intrinsic brain signals but are not inherently designed for research and thus lack flexible control and integration with wearable sensors. We developed a mobile deep brain recording and stimulation (Mo-DBRS) platform that enables wireless and programmable intracranial electroencephalographic recording and electrical stimulation integrated and synchronized with virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) and wearables capable of external measurements (e.g., motion capture, heart rate, skin conductance, respiration, eye tracking, and scalp EEG). When used in freely moving humans with implanted neural devices, this platform is adaptable to ecologically valid environments conducive to elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying naturalistic behaviors and to the development of viable therapies for neurologic and psychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3085654151,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) first emerge in the embryonic aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region. Studies of model organisms defined intersecting signaling pathways that converge to promote HSC emergence predominantly in the ventral domain of the dorsal aorta. Much less is known about mechanisms driving HSC development in humans. Here, to identify secreted signals underlying human HSC development, we combined spatial transcriptomics analysis of dorsoventral polarized signaling in the aorta with gene expression profiling of sorted cell populations and single cells. Our analysis revealed a subset of aortic endothelial cells with a downregulated arterial signature and a predicted lineage relationship with the emerging HSC/progenitor population. Analysis of the ventrally polarized molecular landscape identified endothelin 1 as an important secreted regulator of human HSC development. The obtained gene expression datasets will inform future studies on mechanisms of HSC development in vivo and on generation of clinically relevant HSCs in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3087201259,"Exosomes are vesicles involved in intercellular communication. Their membrane structure and core content is largely dependent on the cell of origin. Exosomes have been investigated both for their biological roles and their possible use as disease biomarkers and drug carriers. These potential technological applications require the rigorous characterization of exosomal blood brain barrier permeability and a description of their lipid bilayer composition. To achieve these goals, we have established a 3D static blood brain barrier system based on existing systems for liposomes and a complementary LC-MS/MS and 31P nuclear magnetic resonance methodology for the analysis of purified human plasma-derived exosome-like vesicles. Results show that the isolated vesicles pass the blood brain barrier and are taken up in endothelial cells. The compositional analysis revealed that the isolated vesicles are enriched in lyso phospholipids and do not contain phosphatidylserine. These findings deviate significantly from the composition of exosomes originating from cell culture, and may reflect active removal by macrophages that respond to exposed phosphahtidylserine."
https://openalex.org/W3087655993,"As a reversible scar repair reaction, liver fibrosis can be blocked or even reversed by proper intervention during its formation. Our work suggests that acid-sensitive ion channel 1a (ASIC1a) participates in liver fibrosis and presents a novel mechanism involving m6 A modification and miR-350/SPRY2. We demonstrated that the expression of ASIC1a was significantly increased in liver tissue of patients with liver fibrosis and animal models of liver fibrosis, as well as PDGF-BB-induced activated HSC-T6. After downregulating the expression of ASIC1a, the degree of liver fibrosis is reduced and HSC activation was inhibited, the level of m6 A modification and miR-350 expression were also reduced. The results of dual luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-350 can bind to the target gene SPRY2 and inhibit its expression. We also found that METTL3 can regulate the extent of m6 A modification of pri-miR-350 by binding to DGCR8. In addition, silencing or blocking the expression of ASIC1a can reduce the expression of PI3K/AKT and ERK signaling pathway-related proteins in activated HSCs. Taken together, we demonstrated that ASIC1a regulates the processing of miR-350 through METTL3-dependent m6 A modification, and mature miR-350 targets SPRY2 and further promotes liver fibrosis through the PI3K/KT and ERK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3087709700,"In recent years, transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBCB) has come to be increasingly used in interventional pulmonology units as it obtains larger and better-quality samples than conventional transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) with forceps. No multicenter studies have been performed, however, that analyse and compare TBCB and TBLB safety and yield according to the interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification.We compared the diagnostic yield and safety of TBCB with cryoprobe sampling versus conventional TBLB forceps sampling in the same patient.Prospective multicenter clinical study of patients with ILD indicated for lung biopsy. Airway management with orotracheal tube, laryngeal mask and rigid bronchoscope was according to the protocol of each centre. All procedures were performed using fluoroscopy and an occlusion balloon. TBLB was followed by TBCB. Complications were recorded after both TBLB and TBCB.Included were 124 patients from 10 hospitals. Airway management was orotracheal intubation in 74% of cases. Diagnostic yield according to multidisciplinary committee results for TBCB was 47.6% and for TBLB was 19.4% (p<0.0001). Diagnostic yield was higher for TBCB compared to TBLB for two groups: idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) and ILD of known cause or association (OR 2.5; 95% CI: 1.4-4.2 and OR 5.8; 95% CI: 2.3-14.3, respectively). Grade 3 (moderate) bleeding after TBCB occurred in 6.5% of patients compared to 0.8% after conventional TBLB.Diagnostic yield for TBCB was higher than for TBLB, especially for two disease groups: IIPs and ILD of known cause or association. The increased risk of bleeding associated with TBCB confirms the need for safe airway management and prophylactic occlusion-balloon use.clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02464592."
https://openalex.org/W3087669328,"Considering that the data available on the cardiovascular (CV) risk of metabolically healthy obesity phenotype, and the effect of transition to an unhealthy status are inconsistent, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible role of transition to unhealthy status among metabolically healthy overweight/obese (MHO) subjects on CVD incidence over a median follow-up of 15.9 years. In this large population-based cohort, 6758 participants (41.6% men) aged ≥ 20 years, were enrolled. Participants were divided into 4 groups based on their obesity phenotypes and follow-up results, including persistent metabolically healthy normal weight (MHNW), persistent MHO, transitional MHO and metabolically unhealthy overweight/obese (MUO). Metabolic health was defined as not having metabolic syndrome based on the Joint Interim Statement (JIS) criteria. Multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for cardiovascular events. During follow-up, rate of CVD Incidence per 1000 person-years were 12 and 7 in males and females, respectively. Multivariable adjusted HRs (CI 95%) of CVD incidence among males and females were 1.37 (.78–2.41) and .85 (.34–2.15) in persistent MHO group, 1.55 (1.02–2.37) and .93 (.41–2.12) in transitional MHO group and 2.64 (1.89–3.70) and 2.65 (1.24–5.68) in MUO group. Our findings showed that CVD risk did not increase in the persistent MHO phenotype over a 15.9-year follow-up in both sexes. However, transition from MHO to MUO status during follow-up increased the CVD risk just in male individuals. Further studies are needed to provide conclusive evidence in favor of benign nature of transitional MHO phenotype in females."
https://openalex.org/W3087115942,"Insufficient remodeling of uterine arteries causes pregnancy-related diseases, including fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia. In these situations, reduced maternal blood flow in the placenta is thought to be responsible for the persistence of a low oxygen environment throughout pregnancy. We hypothesized that chronic activation of transcription factors hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) actively participates in placental underdevelopment, which impairs fetal growth. The computer-assisted analysis in pathological placentas revealed an increased number of HIF-2α-positive nuclei in the syncytium compared to normal human placentas, while HIF-1α stabilization was unchanged. Specific involvement of HIF-2α was confirmed in primary human cytotrophoblasts rendered deficient for HIF1A or HIF2A. Silencing HIF2A increased the expression of main syncytialization markers as well as differentiation and syncytium formation. It also improved placental growth factor bioavailability. None of these changes was seen when silencing HIF1A. Conversely, the experimental induction of HIF-2α expression repressed forskolin-induced differentiation in BeWo choriocarcinoma cells. Our mechanistic insights evidence that transcription factor HIF-2α impairs placental function, thus suggesting its participation in fetal growth restriction and preeclampsia when placentas become chronically hypoxic. Furthermore, it suggests the possibility to develop novel molecular targeting therapies for placental dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3087760764,"Background Preclinical testing of new locoregional therapies for pancreatic cancer has been challenging, due to the lack of a suitable large animal model. Purpose To develop and characterize a porcine model of pancreatic cancer. Unlike small animals, pigs have similar physiology, drug dosing, and immune response to humans. Locoregional therapy in pigs can be performed using the same size catheters and devices as in humans. Methods The Oncopig is a transgenic pig with Cre-inducible TP53R167H and KRASG12D mutations. In 12 Oncopigs, CT-guided core biopsy of the pancreas was performed. The core biopsy was incubated with an adenoviral vector carrying the Cre recombinase gene. The transformed core biopsy was injected back into the pancreas (head, tail, or both). The resulting tumors (n = 19) were characterized on multi-phase contrast-enhanced CT, and on pathology, including immunohistochemistry. Angiographic characterization of the tumors was performed in 3 pigs. Results Pancreatic tumors developed at 19 out of 22 sites (86%) that were inoculated. Average tumor size was 3.0 cm at 1 week (range: 0.5–5.1 cm). H&E and immunohistochemical stains revealed undifferentiated carcinomas, similar to those of the pancreatobiliary system in humans. Neoplastic cells were accompanied by a major inflammatory component. 1 of 12 pigs only had inflammatory nodules without evidence of neoplasia. On multiphase CT, tumors were hypovascular compared to the normal pancreas. There was no pancreatic duct dilation. In 3 pigs, angiography was performed, and in all 3 cases, the artery supplying the pancreatic tumor could be catheterized using a 2.4 F microcatheter. Selective angiography showed the pancreatic tumor, without extra-pancreatic perfusion. Conclusion Pancreatic cancer can be induced in a transgenic pig. Intra-arterial procedures using catheters designed for human interventions were technically feasible in this large animal model."
https://openalex.org/W3087613048,"Background The wide adoption of electronic health records (EHR) system has provided vast opportunities to advance health care services. However, the prevalence of missing values in EHR system poses a great challenge on data analysis to support clinical decision-making. The objective of this study is to develop a new methodological framework that can address the missing data challenge and provide a reliable tool to predict the hospital readmission among Heart Failure patients. Methods We used Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) to impute the missing values. Specifically, a lower dimensional embedding was learned from a small complete dataset and then used to impute the missing values in the incomplete dataset. The GPLVM-based missing data imputation can provide both the mean estimate and the uncertainty associated with the mean estimate. To incorporate the uncertainty in prediction, a constrained support vector machine (cSVM) was developed to obtain robust predictions. We first sampled multiple datasets from the distributions of input uncertainty and trained a support vector machine for each dataset. Then an optimal classifier was identified by selecting the support vectors that maximize the separation margin of a newly sampled dataset and minimize the similarity with the pre-trained support vectors. Results The proposed model was derived and validated using Physionet MIMIC-III clinical database. The GPLVM imputation provided normalized mean absolute errors of 0.11 and 0.12 respectively when 20% and 30% of instances contained missing values, and the confidence bounds of the estimations captures 97% of the true values. The cSVM model provided an average Area Under Curve of 0.68, which improves the prediction accuracy by 7% as compared to some existing classifiers. Conclusions The proposed method provides accurate imputation of missing values and has a better prediction performance as compared to existing models that can only deal with deterministic inputs."
https://openalex.org/W3087099092,"Predicting performance in soccer games has been a major focus within talent identification and development. Past research has mainly used performance levels, such as elite vs. non-elite players, as the performance to predict (i.e. the criterion). Moreover, these studies have mainly focused on isolated performance attributes as predictors of soccer performance levels. However, there has been an increasing interest in finer grained criterion measures of soccer performance, as well as representative assessments at the level of performance predictors. In this study, we first determined the degree to which 7-vs-7 small-sided games can be considered as representative of 11-vs-11 games. Second, we assessed the validity of individual players’ small-sided game performance in predicting their 11-vs-11 game performance on a continuous scale. Moreover, we explored the predictive validity for 11-vs-11 game performance of several physiological and motor tests in isolation. Sixty-three elite youth players of a professional soccer academy participated in 11 to 17 small-sided games and six 11-vs-11 soccer games. In-game performance indicators were assessed through notational analysis and combined into an overall offensive and defensive performance measure, based on their relationship with game success. Physiological and motor abilities were assessed using a sprint, endurance, and agility test. Results showed that the small-sided games were faster paced, but representative of 11-vs-11 games, with the exception of aerial duels. Furthermore, individual small-sided game performance yielded moderate predictive validities with 11-vs-11 game performance. In contrast, the physiological and motor tests yielded small to trivial relations with game performance. Altogether, this study provides novel insights into the application of representative soccer assessments and the use of continuous criterion measures of soccer performance."
https://openalex.org/W3087128478,"Dietary restriction has been well-described to improve health metrics, but whether it could benefit pathophysiological adaptation to extreme environment, for example, microgravity, remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of a daily rhythm of fasting and feeding without reducing caloric intake on cardiac function and metabolism against simulated microgravity. Male rats under ad libitum feeding or time-restricted feeding (TRF; food access limited to 8 hours every day) were subjected to hindlimb unloading (HU) to simulate microgravity. HU for 6 weeks led to left ventricular dyssynchrony and declined cardiac function. HU also lowered pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity and impaired glucose utilization in the heart. All these were largely preserved by TRF. TRF showed no effects on HU-induced loss of cardiac mass, but significantly improved contractile function of cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, TRF raised liver-derived fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) level and enhanced cardiac FGF21 signaling as manifested by upregulation of FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) expression and its downstream markers in HU rats. In isolated cardiomyocytes, FGF21 treatment improved PDH activity and glucose utilization, consequently enhancing cell contractile function. Finally, both liver-specific knockdown (KD) of FGF21 and cardiac-specific FGFR1 KD abrogated the cardioprotective effects of TRF in HU rats. These data demonstrate that TRF improves cardiac glucose utilization and ameliorates cardiac dysfunction induced by simulated microgravity, at least partially, through restoring cardiac FGF21 signaling, suggesting TRF as a potential countermeasure for cardioprotection in long-term spaceflight."
https://openalex.org/W3087406761,"The optic disc(OD) and the optic cup(OC) segmentation is an key step in fundus medical image analysis. Previously, FCN-based methods have been proposed for medical image segmentation tasks. However, the consecutive convolution and pooling operations usually hinder dense prediction tasks which require detailed spatial information, such as image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a network called Recurrent Fully Convolution Network(RFC-Net) for automatic joint segmentation of the OD and the OC, which can captures more high-level information and subtle edge information. The RFC-Net can minimize the loss of spatial information. It is mainly composed of multi-scale input layer, recurrent fully convolutional network, multiple output layer and polar transformation. In RFC-Net, the multi-scale input layer constructs an image pyramid. We propose four recurrent units, which are respectively applied to RFC-Net. Recurrent convolution layer effectively ensures feature representation for OD and OC segmentation tasks through feature accumulation. For each multiple output image, the multiple output cross entropy loss function is applied. To better balance the cup ratio of the segmented image, the polar transformation is used to transform the fundus image from the cartesian coordinate system to the polar coordinate system. We evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed method on the DRISHTI-GS1 dataset. Compared with the original FCN method and other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method achieves better segmentation performance."

Methods We studied 645 (41% black) participants (mean age 55.3±3.5) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging. SES was operationalized as a composite measure of annual income and years of education. Gray matter volume was estimated within the insular cortex, thalamus, cingulate, frontal, inferior parietal, and lateral temporal cortex. These regions are vulnerable to age-related atrophy captured by the Spatial Pattern of Atrophy for Recognition of Brain Aging (SPARE-BA) index. Lifestyle factors of interest included physical activity, cognitive activity (e.g. book/newspaper reading), smoking status, alcohol consumption, and diet. Multivariable linear regressions tested the association between SES and brain volume. Sobel mediation analyses determined if this association was mediated by lifestyle factors. All models were age, sex, and race adjusted. Results Higher SES was positively associated with brain volume (β = .109 SE = .039; p < .01) and smoking status significantly mediated this relationship (z = 2.57). With respect to brain volume, smoking accounted for 27% of the variance (β = -.179 SE = .065; p < .01) that was previously attributed to SES. Conclusion Targeting smoking cessation could be an efficacious means to reduce the health disparity of low SES on brain volume and may decrease vulnerability for dementia."
https://openalex.org/W3087036837,"The photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixing enzyme ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) forms dead-end inhibited complexes while binding multiple sugar phosphates, including its substrate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Rubisco can be rescued from this inhibited form by molecular chaperones belonging to the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA+ proteins) termed Rubisco activases (Rcas). The mechanism of green-type Rca found in higher plants has proved elusive, in part because until recently higher-plant Rubiscos could not be expressed recombinantly. Identifying the interaction sites between Rubisco and Rca is critical to formulate mechanistic hypotheses. Toward that end here we purify and characterize a suite of 33 <i>Arabidopsis</i> Rubisco mutants for their ability to be activated by Rca. Mutation of 17 surface-exposed large subunit residues did not yield variants that were perturbed in their interaction with Rca. In contrast, we find that Rca activity is highly sensitive to truncations and mutations in the conserved N terminus of the Rubisco large subunit. Large subunits lacking residues 1–4 are functional Rubiscos but cannot be activated. Both T5A and T7A substitutions result in functional carboxylases that are poorly activated by Rca, indicating the side chains of these residues form a critical interaction with the chaperone. Many other AAA+ proteins function by threading macromolecules through a central pore of a disc-shaped hexamer. Our results are consistent with a model in which Rca transiently threads the Rubisco large subunit N terminus through the axial pore of the AAA+ hexamer."
https://openalex.org/W3087475461,"Tristetraprolin (TTP), an RNA-binding protein encoded by the ZFP36 gene, is vital for neural differentiation; however, its involvement in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) remains unclear. To explore the role of TTP in PD, an in vitro 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+ ) cell model and an in vivo 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) of PD were used. Transfection of small interfering (si)-TTP RNA upregulated pro-oxidative NOX2 expression and ROS formation, downregulated anti-oxidative GSH and SOD activity；si-TTP upregulated pro-apoptotic cleaved-caspase-3 expression, and downregulated antiapoptotic Bcl-2 expression; while overexpression (OE)-TTP lentivirus caused opposite effects. Through database prediction, luciferase experiment, RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP), and mRNA stability analysis, we evaluated the potential binding sites of TTP to 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of NOX2 mRNA. TTP affected the NOX2 luciferase activity by binding to two sites in the NOX2 3'-UTR. RIP-qPCR confirmed TTP binding to both sites, with a higher affinity for site-2. In addition, TTP reduced the NOX2 mRNA stability. si-NOX2 and antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) reversed si-TTP-induced cell apoptosis. In MPTP-treated mice, TTP expression increased and was co-located with dopaminergic neurons. TTP also inhibited NOX2 and decreased the oxidative stress in vivo. In conclusion, TTP protects against dopaminergic oxidative injury by promoting NOX2 mRNA degradation in the MPP+ /MPTP model of PD, suggesting that TTP could be a potential therapeutic target for regulating the oxidative stress in PD."
https://openalex.org/W3087053420,"Palatal expansion has been widely used for the treatment of transverse discrepancy or maxillae hypoplasia, but the biological mechanism of bone formation during this procedure is largely unknown. Osteoclasts, which could be regulated by T cells and other components of the immune system, play a crucial role in force-induced bone remodeling. However, whether T cells participate in the palatal expansion process remains to be determined. In this study, we conducted the tooth borne rapid palatal expansion model on the mouse, and detect whether the helper T cells (Th) and regulatory T cells (Treg) could affect osteoclasts and further bone formation. After bonding open spring palatal expanders for 3-day, 5-day, 7-day, and retention for 28-day, micro-computed tomography scanning, histologic, and immunofluorescence staining were conducted to evaluate how osteoclasts were regulated by T cells during the bone remodeling process. We revealed that the increased osteoclast number was downregulated at the end of the early stage of rapid palatal expansion. Type 1 helper T (Th1) cells and Type 17 helper T (Th17) cells increased initially and promoted osteoclastogenesis. Thereafter, the regulatory T (Treg) cells emerged and maintained a relatively high level at the late stage of the experiment to downregulate the osteoclast number by inhibiting Th1 and Th17 cells, which governed the new bone formation. In conclusion, orchestrated T cells are able to regulate osteoclasts at the early stage of rapid palatal expansion and further facilitate bone formation during retention. This study identifies that T cells participate in the palatal expansion procedure by regulating osteoclasts and implies the potential possibility for clinically modulating T cells to improve the palatal expansion efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3087343469,"In this study, the effect of surfactants and electrolytes on stability of kaolinite dispersions was analyzed by measuring suspension transmittance, zeta potential, and adsorption. It was experimentally found that the compression of kaolinite electric double layer caused by NaCl addition may reduce the electrostatic repulse force to facilitate the aggregation of kaolinite particles. Surfactant facilitate the aggregation of kaolinite particles mainly through the adsorption of it on the surface of kaolinite to generate hydrophobic force. Compared to anionic surfactant, the cationic surfactant has a better flocculation effect because it can be used in a wide pH range and its adsorption can reduce the electrostatic repulse force between kaolinite particles."
https://openalex.org/W3087709895,"Compared to other OECD countries, Switzerland has the highest rates of hip (HA) and knee arthroplasty (KA).We assessed the regional variation in HA/KA rates and potential determinants of variation in Switzerland.We conducted a population-based analysis using discharge data from all Swiss hospitals during 2013-2016. We derived hospital service areas (HSAs) by analyzing patient flows. We calculated age-/sex-standardized procedure rates and measures of variation (the extremal quotient [EQ, highest divided by lowest rate] and the systemic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in variance of HA/KA rates across HSAs in multilevel regression models, with incremental adjustment for procedure year, age, sex, language, urbanization, socioeconomic factors, burden of disease, and the number of orthopedic surgeons.Overall, 69,578 HA and 69,899 KA from 55 HSAs were analyzed. The mean age-/sex-standardized HA rate was 265 (range 179-342) and KA rate was 256 (range 186-378) per 100,000 persons and increased over time. The EQ was 1.9 for HA and 2.5 for KA. The SCV was 2.0 for HA and 2.2 for KA, indicating a low variation across HSAs. When adjusted for procedure year and demographic, cultural, and sociodemographic factors, the models explained 75% of the variance in HA and 63% in KA across Swiss HSAs.Switzerland has high HA/KA rates with a modest regional variation, suggesting that the threshold to perform HA/KA may be uniformly low across regions. One third of the variation remained unexplained and may, at least in part, represent differing physician beliefs and attitudes towards joint arthroplasty."
https://openalex.org/W3087153014,"Vitamin A and its metabolites are key regulators of the development of adipose tissue and associated metabolic complications. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of high fat diet and 13-cis retinoic acid (13 cRA) application on metabolic parameters, adipogenic and inflammatory indicators in female Lewis rats. Female rats of Lewis strain were fed standard laboratory diet (STD) and high fat diet (HFD, 45% of saturated fatty acids) during 30 days. The groups were divided into additional 3 groups (6 rats each): two experimental groups that received 13 cRA orally on a daily basis during 30 days (7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively) and the control group that was given sunflower oil. Animals were sacrificed after 60 days. Feeding of Lewis rats with chronic HFD diet with 13 cRA supplementation increased weight gain, adiposity index, dyslipidaemia, hyperleptinaemia, insulin resistance, VLDL concentrations, oxidative stress and atherogenic indices. Administration of 13 cRA in Lewis rats fed STD did not change the weight of the animals, but it slightly increased the atherogenic parameters. 13 cRA and HFD affect metabolic parameters, glucose and lipid metabolism in Lewis rats and its administration has a completely different effect on metabolism in rats fed STD, highlighting the complex role of vitamin A supplementation in obesity. Other factors, such as genetics, age, sex, adipose tissue distribution, also must be taken into consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3087689088,"The transcription factor TBX1 is the major gene implicated in 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). The complex clinical phenotype includes vascular anomalies and a recent report presented new cases of primary lymphedema in 22q11.2DS patients. We have previously shown that TBX1 is required for systemic lymphatic vessel development in prenatal mice and it is critical for their survival postnatally. Using loss-of-function genetics and transgenesis in the mouse, we show here a strong genetic interaction between Tbx1 and Vegfr3 in cardiac lymphangiogenesis. Intriguingly, we found that different aspects of the cardiac lymphatic phenotype in Tbx1-Vegfr3 compound heterozygotes were regulated independently by the two genes, with Tbx1 primarily regulating vessel numbers and Vegfr3 vessel morphology. Consistent with this observation, Tbx1Cre-activated expression of a Vegfr3 transgene rescued partially the cardiac lymphatic abnormalities in compound heterozygotes. Through time-controlled genetic experiments, we show that Tbx1 is activated and required in cardiac lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) progenitors between E10.5 and E11.5. Furthermore, we found that it is also required later in development for the growth of the cardiac lymphatics. Finally, our study revealed a differential sensitivity between ventral and dorsal cardiac lymphatics to the effects of altered Tbx1 and Vegfr3 gene dosage, and we show that this likely results from an earlier requirement for Tbx1 in ventral cardiac LEC progenitors."
https://openalex.org/W3087092550,"In rabies endemic areas, appropriate management of dog bites is critical in human rabies prevention. Victims must immediately wash bite wound for 15 minutes with water, soap, and a disinfectant before seeking medical care. This study investigated the epidemiology of dog bites and the determinants of compliance to these pre-clinical guidelines requirements among dog bite victims from high rabies-burden areas of Wakiso and Kampala, Uganda. An explanatory sequential mixed-methods study design was used. Quantitative data were collected from 376 dog-bite patients at two healthcare facilities. Qualitative data were also collected through 13 in-depth interviews with patients, healthcare workers, herbalists, and veterinarians. Qualitative data were analyzed using a deductive thematic approach. Generalized linear models were used to determine factors associated with compliance. Nearly half (190, 51%) of the patients were from Wakiso District and 293 (77.9%) had grade II wounds. Most of the wounds (171, 45.5%) were on the legs. Two-thirds of the bites occurred in public places. Only 70 (19%) of the bite patients had complied with pre-clinical guidelines. Nearly half of the patients had applied substances that were not recommended e.g. herbs (47/193), antiseptics (46/193), black stone (25/193), and unknown creams (10/193). Factors negatively associated with compliance included: being aged 15 years or older, adjPR = 0.70 (0.47-0.92) and knowing the dog owner, adjPR = 0.65 (0.36-0.93). However, attainment of secondary or higher education, adjPR = 1.76 (1.24-3.79), being in employment, adjPR = 1.48 (1.09-2.31), perception that the dog was sick, adjPR = 1.47 (1.02-2.72) and knowledge about the dog's subsequent victim(s) adjPR = 0.35 (0.17-0.70) were positively associated with compliance. High occurrence of dog bites in public places by free-roaming dogs suggests the need for deliberate promotion of responsible dog ownership. Additionally, targeted health education may be required to improve the low compliance to pre-clinical guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3087170905,"Mouse models are frequently used to study mechanisms of human diseases. Recently, we observed a spontaneous bimodal variation in liver weight in C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed a semisynthetic diet. We now characterized the spontaneous variation in liver weight and its relationship with parameters of hepatic lipid and bile acid (BA) metabolism. In male C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed AIN-93G from birth to postnatal day (PN)70, we measured plasma BA, lipids, Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride (TG) secretion, and hepatic mRNA expression patterns. Mice were sacrificed at PN21, PN42, PN63 and PN70. Liver weight distribution was bimodal at PN70. Mice could be subdivided into two nonoverlapping groups based on liver weight: 0.6 SD 0.1 g (approximately one-third of mice, small liver; SL), and 1.0 SD 0.1 g (normal liver; NL; p<0.05). Liver histology showed a higher steatosis grade, inflammation score, more mitotic figures and more fibrosis in the SL versus the NL group. Plasma BA concentration was 14-fold higher in SL (p<0.001). VLDL-TG secretion rate was lower in SL mice, both absolutely (-66%, p<0.001) and upon correction for liver weight (-44%, p<0.001). Mice that would later have the SL-phenotype showed lower food efficiency ratios during PN21-28, suggesting the cause of the SL phenotype is present at weaning (PN21). Our data show that approximately one-third of C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice fed semisynthetic diet develop spontaneous liver disease with aberrant histology and parameters of hepatic lipid, bile acid and lipoprotein metabolism. Study designs involving this mouse strain on semisynthetic diets need to take the SL phenotype into account. Plasma lipids may serve as markers for the identification of the SL phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W3087249279,"Abstract Sumoylation is an essential posttranslational modification in eukaryotes that has emerged as an important pathway in oncogenic processes. Most human cancers display hyperactivated sumoylation and many cancer cells are remarkably sensitive to its inhibition, thus supporting application of chemical sumoylation inhibitors in cancer treatment. Here we show, first, that transformed embryonic fibroblasts derived from mice haploinsufficient for Ubc9, the essential and unique gene encoding the SUMO E2 conjugating enzyme, exhibit enhanced proliferation and transformed phenotypes in vitro and as xenografts ex vivo. To then evaluate the possible impact of loss of one Ubc9 allele in vivo, we used a mouse model of intestinal tumorigenesis. We crossed Ubc9 +/− mice with mice harboring a conditional ablation of Apc either all along the crypt–villus axis or only in Lgr5 + crypt-based columnar (CBC) cells, the cell compartment that includes the intestinal stem cells proposed as cells-of-origin of intestinal cancer. While Ubc9 +/− mice display no overt phenotypes and no globally visible hyposumoylation in cells of the small intestine, we found, strikingly, that, upon loss of Apc in both models, Ubc9 +/− mice develop more (&gt;2-fold) intestinal adenomas and show significantly shortened survival. This is accompanied by reduced global sumoylation levels in the polyps, indicating that Ubc9 levels become critical upon oncogenic stress. Moreover, we found that, in normal conditions, Ubc9 +/− mice show a moderate but robust (15%) increase in the number of Lgr5 + CBC cells when compared to their wild-type littermates, and further, that these cells display higher degree of stemness and cancer-related and inflammatory gene expression signatures that, altogether, may contribute to enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis. The phenotypes of Ubc9 haploinsufficiency discovered here indicate an unanticipated tumor-suppressive role of sumoylation, one that may have important implications for optimal use of sumoylation inhibitors in the clinic."

Ketamine anesthesia is used in humans and non-human primates but may be associated with adverse effects, including neuromuscular reactions. The effects of aging on ketamine adverse effects is not well characterized. Urodynamic recordings and electromyography (EMG) studies were performed in aged (>20 years old) and adult (3.9–14.9 years old) female rhesus macaques under an equal and light plane of sedation by constant rate infusion (CRI) of ketamine. A total of 4 of 41 adult subjects (9.7%) showed clinical signs of ketamine-induced abnormal neuromuscular reactivity, whereas a larger portion of 14 of 26 aged subjects showed similar ketamine-induced neuromuscular reactivity (53.8%; P< 0.001). The ketamine CRI rate was 19.8±0.9 mg/kg/h in adults and lower in aged subjects at 16.5±1.4 mg/kg/h (P<0.05). The ketamine CRI rate was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.30, P<0.05, n = 64). The incidence of ketamine reactivity or CRI rate was not different between aged pre-and post-menopausal females. EMG recordings during neuromuscular reactivity showed coordinated activation of multiple muscles, suggesting a central nervous system (CNS) mechanism for ketamine-associated neuromuscular reactivity. The incidence of ketamine-induced neuromuscular reactivity is age related but not affected by the estrous cycle in female rhesus macaques. A coordinated activation of multiple muscles, innervated by different peripheral nerves, suggests that ketamine-induced neuromuscular reactivity originates in the CNS."

We aim to study stroke in the Qatari population.A retrospective review was undertaken of all Qatari adults presenting with stroke to Hamad Medical Corporation over a 5-year period. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and all other clinical characteristics of the patients. The primary outcome was the incidence of stroke in the Qatari patients. Comparison was made between the sexes.862 patients were included, with 58.9% being male. The average incidence of stroke over the 5-year period was 92.04 per 100,000 adult Qatari population. The mean age of the cohort was 64.3±14.4 years, (range 19-105 years). The mean age of first ever cerebrovascular event was 63.2±14.5 years. The diagnosis was ischemic stroke in (73.7%), transient ischemic attack in (13.8%), intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in (11.6%), subarachnoid hemorrhage in (0.7%) and (0.2%) cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Small vessel disease was the most common cause of ischemic stroke accounting for (46.5%), followed by large artery atherosclerosis (24.5%). Hypertension (82.7%) and diabetes (71.6%) were particularly prevalent in this cohort. Females were older (65.8±14.1 vs 63.4±14.5 years), had more hypertension and diabetes and more disability or death at 90 days (p<0.05) compared to Qatari males.Stroke occurs at a significantly lower age in Qataris compared to the western population.

https://openalex.org/W3087611816,"Elevated postprandial plasma glucose is a risk factor for development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that the inter-individual postprandial plasma glucose response varies partly depending on the intestinal microbiome composition and function. We analyzed data from Danish adults (n = 106), who were self-reported healthy and attended the baseline visit of two previously reported randomized controlled cross-over trials within the Gut, Grain and Greens project. Plasma glucose concentrations at five time points were measured before and during three hours after a standardized breakfast. Based on these data, we devised machine learning algorithms integrating bio-clinical, as well as shotgun-sequencing-derived taxa and functional potentials of the intestinal microbiome to predict individual postprandial glucose excursions. In this post hoc study, we found microbial and clinical features, which predicted up to 48% of the inter-individual variance of postprandial plasma glucose responses (Pearson correlation coefficient of measured vs. predicted values, R = 0.69, 95% CI: 0.45 to 0.84, p<0.001). The features were age, fasting serum triglycerides, systolic blood pressure, BMI, fasting total serum cholesterol, abundance of Bifidobacterium genus, richness of metagenomics species and abundance of a metagenomic species annotated to Clostridiales at order level. A model based only on microbial features predicted up to 14% of the variance in postprandial plasma glucose excursions (R = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.64, p = 0.04). Adding fasting glycaemic measures to the model including microbial and bio-clinical features increased the predictive power to R = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.59 to 0.89, p<0.001), explaining more than 60% of the inter-individual variance of postprandial plasma glucose concentrations. The outcome of the study points to a potential role of the taxa and functional potentials of the intestinal microbiome. If validated in larger studies our findings may be included in future algorithms attempting to develop personalized nutrition, especially for prediction of individual blood glucose excursions in dys-glycaemic individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3087705390,"Background Predicting long-term care trajectories at the time of HIV diagnosis may allow targeted interventions. Our objective was to uncover distinct CD4-based trajectories and determine baseline demographic, clinical, and contextual factors associated with trajectory membership. Methods We used data from the Sizanani trial (NCT01188941), in which adults were enrolled prior to HIV testing in Durban, South Africa from August 2010–January 2013. We ascertained CD4 counts from the National Health Laboratory Service over 5y follow-up. We used group-based statistical modeling to identify groups with similar CD4 count trajectories and Bayesian information criteria to determine distinct CD4 trajectories. We evaluated baseline factors that predict membership in specific trajectories using multinomial logistic regression. We examined calendar year of participant enrollment, age, gender, cohabitation, TB positivity, self-identified barriers to care, and ART initiation within 3 months of diagnosis. Results 688 participants had longitudinal data available. Group-based trajectory modeling identified four distinct trajectories: one with consistently low CD4 counts (21%), one with low CD4 counts that increased over time (22%), one with moderate CD4 counts that remained stable (41%), and one with high CD4 counts that increased over time (16%). Those with higher CD4 counts at diagnosis were younger, less likely to have TB, and less likely to identify barriers to care. Those in the least favorable trajectory (consistently low CD4 count) were least likely to start ART within 3 months. Conclusions One-fifth of people newly-diagnosed with HIV presented with low CD4 counts that failed to rise over time. Less than 40% were in a trajectory characterized by increasing CD4 counts. Patients in more favorable trajectories were younger, less likely to have TB, and less likely to report barriers to healthcare. Better understanding barriers to early care engagement and ART initiation will be necessary to improve long-term clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3087486550,"Despite careful patient selection, successful recanalization in intravenous thrombolysis is only achieved in approximately 50% of cases. Understanding changes in cerebral autoregulation during and following successful recanalization in acute ischemic stroke patients who receive intravenous thrombolysis, may inform the management of common physiological perturbations, including blood pressure, in turn reducing the risk of reperfusion injury. Cerebral blood velocity (Transcranial Doppler), blood pressure (Finometer) and end-tidal carbon dioxide (capnography) were continuously recorded in 11 acute ischemic stroke patients who received intravenous thrombolysis (5 female, mean ± SD age 68±12 years) over 4-time points, during and at the following time intervals after intravenous thrombolysis: 23.9±2.6 hrs, 18.1±7.0 days and 89.6±4.2 days. Reductions in blood pressure (p = 0.04) were observed during intravenous thrombolysis. Reductions in heart rate (p<0.005) and critical closing pressure [Affected hemisphere (p = 0.02) and non-affected hemisphere (p<0.005)] were observed post intravenous thrombolysis. End-tidal CO2 increased during the sub-acute and chronic stages (p = 0.028). Reduction in affected hemisphere phase at low frequency was observed during intravenous thrombolysis (p = 0.021) and at subsequent visits (p = 0.048). No changes were observed in cerebral blood velocity, coherence, gain and Autoregulation Index during the follow-up period. Intravenous thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke patients induced changes in affected hemisphere phase and other key hemodynamic parameters, but not Autoregulation Index. Further investigation of cerebral autoregulation is warranted in a larger acute ischemic stroke cohort to inform its potential role in individualized management plans."
https://openalex.org/W3087026950,"Objectives The aim of this study was to utilise corneal confocal microscopy to quantify corneal nerve morphology and establish the presence of sub-clinical small fibre damage and peripheral neuropathy in children with celiac disease. Methods This is a cross-sectional cohort study of twenty children with celiac disease and 20 healthy controls who underwent clinical and laboratory assessments and corneal confocal microscopy. Corneal nerve fiber density (no.mm2), corneal nerve branch density (no.mm2), corneal nerve fiber length (mm.mm2), corneal nerve fiber tortuosity and inferior whorl length (mm.mm2) were quantified manually. Results Corneal nerve fiber density (34.7±8.6 vs. 32.9±8.6; P = 0.5), corneal nerve branch density (47.2±24.5 vs. 47.3±20.0; P = 0.1) and corneal nerve fiber length (20.0±5.1 vs. 19.5±4.5; P = 0.8) did not differ between children with celiac disease and healthy controls. Corneal nerve fiber tortuosity (11.4±1.9 vs 13.5±3.0; P = 0.01) was significantly lower and inferior whorl length (20.0±5.5 vs 23.0±3.8; P = 0.06) showed a non-significant reduction in children with celiac disease compared to healthy controls. Inferior whorl length correlated significantly with corneal nerve fiber density (P = 0.005), corneal nerve branch density (P = 0.04), and corneal nerve fiber length (P = 0.002). Conclusion Corneal confocal microscopy demonstrates minimal evidence of neuropathy in children with celiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W3087371398,"Diabetes (DM) has a significant impact on public health. We performed an in silico study of paired datasets of messenger RNA (mRNA) micro-RNA (miRNA) transcripts to delineate potential biosignatures that could distinguish prediabetes (pre-DM), type-1DM (T1DM) and type-2DM (T2DM). Two publicly available datasets containing expression values of mRNA and miRNA obtained from individuals diagnosed with pre-DM, T1DM or T2DM, and normoglycemic controls (NC), were analyzed using systems biology approaches to define combined signatures to distinguish different clinical groups. The mRNA profile of both pre-DM and T2DM was hallmarked by several differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to NC. Nevertheless, T1DM was characterized by an overall low number of DEGs. The miRNA signature profiles were composed of a substantially lower number of differentially expressed targets. Gene enrichment analysis revealed several inflammatory pathways in T2DM and fewer in pre-DM, but with shared findings such as Tuberculosis. The integration of mRNA and miRNA datasets improved the identification and discriminated the group composed by pre-DM and T2DM patients from that constituted by normoglycemic and T1DM individuals. The integrated transcriptomic analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression revealed a unique biosignature able to characterize different types of DM."

Ready-made garment industry has long historically adopted fewer technological and process advancement as compared to automotive, electronics and semiconductor industries. Simulation modeling of garment assembly line has attracted a number of researchers as one way for insightful analysis of the system behaviour and improving its performance. However, most of simulation studies have considered ill-defined experimental design which cannot fully explore the assembly line design alternatives and does not uncover the interaction effects of the input variables. Simulation metamodeling is an approach to assembly line design which has recently been of interest to researchers. However, its application in garment assembly line design has never been well explored. In this paper, simulation metamodeling of trouser assembly line with 72 operations was demonstrated. The linear regression metamodel technique with resolution-V design was used. The effects of five factors: bundle size, job release policy, task assignment pattern, machine number and helper number on throughput of the trouser assembly line were studied. An increase of the production throughput by 28.63% was achieved for the best factors’ setting of the metamodel."
https://openalex.org/W3087641260,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects individuals of all races and ethnicities; however, its prevalence is highest in non-Hispanic black individuals (BL) relative to other populations. While previous research has provided valuable insight into elevated CVD risk in the BL population, this work has been almost exclusively conducted in men. This is alarming given that BL women suffer from CVD at an equivalent rate to BL men and each has a greater prevalence when compared to all other ethnicities, regardless of sex. The importance of investigating sex differences in mechanisms of cardiovascular function is highlighted by the National Institute of Health requiring sex to be considered as a biological variable in research studies to better our of key sex influences on health processes and outcomes. The mechanism(s) responsible for the elevated CVD risk in BL women remains unclear and is likely multifactorial. Limited studies in BL women suggest that, while impaired vasodilator capacity is involved, heightened vasoconstrictor tone and/or responsiveness may also contribute. Within this mini-review, we will discuss potential mechanisms of elevated rates of hypertension and other CVDs in BL individuals with a particular focus on young, otherwise healthy, college-aged women. To stimulate academic thought and future research, we will also discuss potential mechanisms for impaired vascular function in BL women, as well as possible divergent mechanisms between BL men and women based on either preliminary data or plausible speculation extending from findings in the existing literature. Last, we will conclude with potential future research directions aimed at better understanding the elevated risk for hypertension and CVD in BL women."
https://openalex.org/W3087281984,"To study the performance and mutual influence of a syncretic railway network (SRN) that comprises high-speed railway, regional railway, and urban rail transit under the condition of traffic overload during peak hours, we discuss the interdependent characteristics on cascading overload failure of SRNs under the cooperative organization from the perspective of an interdependent network. However, most existing research on cascading failure in interdependent network ignores the inconsistency between the physical structure and transportation organization of the subnetwork in an actual network, in addition to the restrictions on the load redistribution strategy of stations and sections in the load-capacity model of the interdependent network; especially, the influence of transfer behavior on the load redistribution inter subnetwork. In this study, we investigate the robustness of an interdependent SRN under overload and risk propagation. We propose a partially interdependent network model of a multimode rail transit, develop a novel cascading overload failure model with tunable parameters of load redistribution inter subnetwork, and analyze interdependent characteristics, cascade failure process, and robustness of an SRN under multiscene conditions, i.e., different attack and load distribution strategies, via simulations. A case study of an SRN in the metropolitan area of Chengdu, China is presented; the results indicate that, when the reserve coefficient of the metro subnetwork is 0.4 and the overload coefficient of the regional railway subnetwork is greater than 1.2, the station reserve capacity and overload capacity of the SRN is appropriately improved. When passenger load increases to a certain range, the reserve and overload capacities of stations in the regional railway subnetwork do not considerably contribute to robustness. Thus, a surplus load distribution strategy is recommended to improve robustness. The results of this paper have considerable significance for the planning, structural optimization, and operation safety of SRNs."
https://openalex.org/W3086999606,"This study was designed to clarify whether the irradiation of carotid baroreceptor (CB) with low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) protects against obesity by rebalancing the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Obesity was induced using a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks in Sprague-Dawley rats. Irradiation with LIPUS was daily (20 minutes a day) applied to the right CB. In our study, LIPUS significantly ameliorated metabolic disorders in obese rats. LIPUS partly restored norepinephrine (NE) and acetylcholine (ACH) levels in the perirenal white adipose tissue (PWAT), epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT), interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT), and plasma of obese rats. LIPUS partially rectified the dysregulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α/ɣ pathway in the PWAT, EWAT, and IBAT of obese rats. PPARγ and PPARγ target genes respond more sensitively to HFD and LIPUS in PWAT and EWAT than in IBAT. NE, ACH, uncoupling protein-1, phosphorylated AMPK, PPARα, and PPARα target genes respond more sensitively to HFD and LIPUS in IBAT than in PWAT and EWAT. Conclusion: LIPUS irradiation of CB exerts different metabolic protection in PWAT, EWAT, and IBAT by rebalancing the ANS and rectifying the AMPK/PPARα/ɣ pathway in obese rats."

This study investigated the causal mechanisms of disruptive behavior by delayed passengers in three aspects: environmental, managerial, and personal. Data on flight delays at Shenzhen Airport in 2018 were collected and analyzed. The main factors leading to disruptive behavior by delayed passengers were identified, and an early warning model for disturbances was developed using multiple logistic regression and a back-propagation(BP) neural network. The results indicated that the proposed model and method were feasible. Compared to the logistic regression model, the BP neural network model had advantages in predicting disturbances by delayed passengers, showing higher prediction accuracy. The BP network weight analysis method was used to obtain the influence weight of each factor on behavior change of delayed passengers. The influence weight of different factors was obtained, providing an assistant decision-making method to address disruption from flight-delayed passengers."
