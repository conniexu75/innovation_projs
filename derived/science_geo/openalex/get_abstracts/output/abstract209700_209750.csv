https://openalex.org/W2026236458,"Seventeen of 24 sera from children who had received multiple transfusions contained agglutinating antibodies against a Gm factor absent in the individual's serum gamma globulin. Each of these agglutinators was highly specific for a single Gm factor, and all proved useful as reagents for genetic typing. The accumulated evidence indicates that they resulted from genetically foreign gamma globulin introduced by transfusion."

https://openalex.org/W2031245246,"The unit activity of the neurons in the hypothalamic ""satiety"" and ""feeding"" centers and adjacent control regions was recorded before and after intravenous injection of glucose. Increase in blood glucose and arteriovenous glucose difference (glucose utilization) increases the activity of satiety center neurons and slightly decreases the activity of feeding center neurons, without producing any significant change in the activity of control regions."

https://openalex.org/W36432157,"The presence of alkali accelerates the rate of destruction of pyridine nucleotides (I), and the cleavage of the nicotinamideribose linkage of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) under alkaline conditions has also been demonstrated (2). Prolonged treatment in alkali can cause cleavage of the pyrophosphate linkage of NAD as demonstrated by the release of adenylic acid. However, the hydrolysis of this linkage appears to occur after an initial hydrolysis of the nicotinamide-ribose bond has taken place (3). Colowick, Kaplan, and Ciotti (4) observed that the rate of hydrolysis of the nicotinamide-ribose linkage of NAD at 100” increases with increasing pH above pH 6.0. The rates of hydrolysis obtained in various buffers at pH 7.5 were found to depend on the type of buffer used. Tris and acetate buffers did not increase the rate of hydrolysis above that observed with unbuffered NAD at this pH, whereas phosphate and citrate buffers enhanced it 3- to 4-fold. It was noted (1) that Tris could almost completely abolish this stimulatory effect of phosphate and citrate buffers. In a study of the stability of pyridine nucleotides, Lowry, Passonneau, and Rock (5) confirmed the phosphate stimulation of NAD hydrolysis as well as the dependence of this reaction on pH in the region of 6.0 to 8.0. The phosphate-stimulated hydrolysis of NAD has proved to be a convenient procedure for liberating the pyridine moiety from a dinucleotide for purposes of identification (6, 7). One advantage of this chemical hydrolysis over the enzyme-catalyzed cleavage of NAD and related dinucleotides is the freedom from specificity requirements that often arise in the enzyme reactions. The experiments reported here were carried out to elucidate the roles of phosphate and Tris buffers in the hydrolytic reactions with NAD and related compounds."

When subjects were alert the time between two successive responses did not vary greatly; however, as subjects became increasingly drowsy these times lengthened and the mean voltage of the peak alpha frequency decreased."

Enzymatic synthesis of the polysaccharide has now been achieved with a particulate preparation obtained from the organ- ism; the sialic acid donor is cytidine 5’-monophospho-N-acetyl- neuraminic acid. The sugar nucleotide CMP-NAN,’ unique in the sense that it contains but 1 phosphate residue, was first isolated from"

https://openalex.org/W1969625374,GENETIC recombination of Streptomycetes was first reported by Sermonti and Spada-Sermonti in 19551. By crossing different nutritional mutants of Streptomyces coelicolor various auxotrophic and prototrophic types have been obtained.

https://openalex.org/W2017110954,"The physicochemical properties of photocatalyzed Cyanogum gel offer practical advantages in the analysis of specific immunological precipitation techniques: use of any buffer at any pH; most probable neutrality for stains or reagents; remarkable resolution of the immunological precipitates, visible microscopically; possibility of direct dark-background examination of the precipitates, so that their kinetics can be studied and they can be photographed before dyeing and staining. This gel seems particularly suitable for immunoanalysis of complex and unstable antigenic products, such as tissue homogenates."

https://openalex.org/W2025517625,"DRS. C. Kidson and J. G. Gorman1 report observations on frequencies of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in different parts of New Guinea and New Britain, which make a welcome addition to our knowledge of the population genetics of this area. They note that low frequencies of G6PD deficiency occur in some populations living in malarious parts of New Guinea, New Britain and elsewhere. On the basis of this fact, and a report2 suggesting that “no significant difference in Pl. falciparum parasite densities occurs between affected and normal children under 3 years of age in Thailand and that affected children in this age-group may have higher densities of the non-lethal Pl. vivax”, Kidson and Gorman issue “a challenge to the concept of selection by malaria in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency”."

Lightscattering measurements and electron micrographs show that the treated membranes assume predominantly planar forms. This change in structure appears to be contingent upon a continued transport of electrons from ascorbic acid."

The enzymatic products (for which the term ‘chondromucopeptides’ is proposed) leach out of the cartilage into the blood and are excreted in the urine1."
