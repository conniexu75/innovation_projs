This increase in receptor sites may account for behavioral supersensitivity to dopamine receptor stimulants in such animals and for tardive dyskinesia in patients treated with these drugs."

Their construction incorporates mutations that make them simple to use and also greatly increases their safety for the biological containment of cloned recombinant DNA. Three of the Charon vector phages, 3A, 4A, and 16A, have been certified for use as EK2 vector-host systems, when propagated in bulk in a special bacterial host, DP50SupF. We present here some of the data on which the safety of these systems was evaluated. DNA fragments ranging in size from 0 to 2.2 × 104 base pairs can be cloned in these EK2 Charon phages."

https://openalex.org/W1510034640,"The nanosecond time dependence of the fluorescence depolarization of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene in L-alpha-dimyristoyllecithin vesicles was determined at temperatures above and below the midpoint of the gel-liquid crystalline transition. In neither case could the decay of the total fluorescent emission or the decay of the emission anisotropy be described adequately in terms of single exponential decay laws. At the lower temperature, the emission anisotropy did not approach zero in the time window available for measurement, a finding which may indicate that the range over which rotation of the probe can freely occur is restricted. The results are discussed in relation to the concept of microviscosity of bilayer membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1549115605,"Plasma membrane vesicles isolated from human platelets accumulate 5-hydroxytryptamine when an electrical potential (interior negative) or an Na+ gradient (out greater than in) is imposed across the vesicle membrane. Kinetic studies reveal a Km of 0.5 micronM for the transport process. Uptake is inhibited strongly by tricyclic antidepressants and by ionophores such as gramicidin which catalyze transmembrane exchange of Na+ for K+. Transport is absolutely dependent upon external Na+ and Cl- and is only mildly, if at all, inhibited by reserpine, cinanserin, ouabain, or arsenate. Experiments are presented which suggest that a single positive charge crosses the vesicle membrane with each molecule of 5-hydroxytryptamine. The results provide direct evidence for Na+-coupled active 5-hydroxytryptamine transport by the platelet plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W27829598,"Proteoglycan monomers were subfractionated according to buoyant density by dissociative CsCl density gradient centrifugation. It was shown that with decreasing buoyant density of the proteoglycan subfraction: (a) the average sizes of the molecules decreased (shown by Sepharose 2B chromatography); (b) the relative content of chondroitin sulfate decreased; (c) the relative content of protein increased; (d) the relative proportion of the amino acids glycine and serine, which occur close to the chondroitin sulfate-peptide linkage, decreased; (e) the relative proportion of the hyaluronic acid-binding region released by treatment of proteoglycans with cyanogen bromide increased; (f) the relative content of the keratan sulfate-enriched region increased. The data indicate that proteoglycans contain a nonvariable hyaluronic acid-binding region, a keratan sulfate-enriched region and a chondroitin sulfate-enriched region of variable size. It is concluded that proteoglycans vary in size mainly because of variations in the size of the chondroitin sulfate-enriched region. Additional data were obtained using subfractions of proteoglycan monomers isolated according to size differences by using Sepharose 2B chromatography. The Kav values of the subfractions on Sepharose 2B ranged from 0 to 0.54. Analyses of these subfractions showed the same variations with size of the content of chondroitin sulfate, protein, amino acids, hyaluronic acid-binding region, and keratan sulfate-enriched region, as was shown for the subfractions isolated at different buoyant densities in the dissociative gradient."
https://openalex.org/W2029152133,"Autoradiographic studies of rat heart reveal that tritiated estradiol concentrates in cell nuclei of the myocardium of the atria and auricles, similar to the myometrium of the uterus. This suggests that estrogen has a direct effect on atrial myocytes through which its ""protective"" action may be mediated. Cardiac glycosides that are known to exert estrogen-like effects on classical estrogen target tissues, such as uterine muscle, endometrium, vagina, and mammary gland, probably act on atrial muscle through a genomic, steroid hormone-like mechanism of action."

Juveniles of the former species are found in a variety of habitats, whereas juveniles of the latter occur almost exclusively under the spine canopy of conspecific adults. The commercial harvest of S. franciscanus thus seems to affect nursery grounds as well as the reproductive potential of exploited populations."
https://openalex.org/W1937480282,"Abstract Oviduct nuclei from laying hens, or from chicks given an optimal dose of estrogen, contain receptors with a high affinity for 17beta-estradiol (apparent Kd of about 3.7 nM) at a concentration of about 10,600 molecules per tubular gland cell. Chicks withdrawn from estrogen stimulation exhibit a 7-fold lower level of nuclear estrogen receptors. Radioimmunoassay of 17beta-estradiol in the serum indicates that birds withdrawn from estrogen stimulation have a serum level of 0.09 nM. A maximum concentration of oviduct nuclear receptors is achieved when the serum level reaches 0.7 nM 17beta-estradiol. Endogenous 17beta-estradiol in the serum of laying hens is also approximately 0.7 nM. The concentration of nuclear estrogen receptors achieved by administering different dosages of 17beta-estradiol, 17beta-estradiol-benzoate, or diethylstilbestrol is related to the rate of accumulation of ovalbumin and conalbumin mRNA. The rate of conalbumin mRNA production is directly proportional to the concentration of nuclear receptors, i.e. half-maximal induction is obtained with about 5,300 nuclear receptors per tubular gland cell. In contrast, half-maximal induction of ovalbumin mRNA occurs when nuclear receptor levels are 80% of maximum; this is achieved with a dose of estrogen about 2.5 times that required for half-maximal conalbumin mRNA induction. These differential responses may be related either to different numbers of specific binding sites regulating the production of each mRNA, or to different affinities of regulatory sites for estrogen receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1593774413,"The development and turnover of acetylcholine receptors in a nonfusing muscle cell line has been investigated using iodinated alpha-bungarotoxin as a probe for acetylcholine receptor. logarithmically growing cells do not bind toxin, while cells that have ceased cell division bind toxin at a site which has the pharmacological characteristics of an acetylcholine receptor. These binding sites are removed from the cell surface at a rate equal to 8.9 +/- 0.5% of the total surface binding sites/h and appear at a rate equal to 8.3 +/- 1.5% of the total surface binding sites/h. Appearance of new binding sites can occur for a period of 1 1/2 h in the presence of cycloheximide, during which time 15% of the surface receptors can be replaced. There is a hidden population of receptors which is not accessible to toxin without disrupting the cell. This population amounts to 35% of the Triton-extractable receptors in the cell and is composed of two classes. One class, termed a precursor receptor, appears to move from the hidden population to the cell surface, and composes about 40% of the total hidden receptor population. The second class of hidden receptors does not appear to function as a surface precursor and is neither depleted nor enriched by any of the procedures we employed. Surface receptors and hidden receptors are distinguishable on the basis of their sedimentation coefficient about 0.5 to 0.6 S lower than surface receptors. We were unable to distinguish between precursor and non-precursor hidden receptors on the basis of cursor and nonprecursor hidden receptors on the basis of their sedimentation coefficients."
https://openalex.org/W1559512438,"The mechanism of hormone-stimulated prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis was investigated in rabbit renomedullary interstitial cells in tissue culture. Angiotensin II, bradykinin, and arginine vasopressin stimulated arachidonic acid release and subsequent prostaglandin biosynthesis. Indomethacin completely inhibited prostaglandin biosynthesis without affecting arachidonic acid release. Mepacrine, a phospholipase inhibitor, inhibited arachidonic acid release without affecting subsequent synthesis of prostaglandin E2. Our studies suggest that arachidonic acid release via hormone-activated phospholipase or acylhydrolase (or both) is the mechanism of hormone-stimulated prostaglandin E2 biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1607068432,"When preadipose 3T3 cells pass from growing to resting state, they increase their rate of synthesis of triacylglycerol from precursors and convert to adipose cells. The behavior of two enzymes involved in the synthesis of triacylglycerol, glycerophosphate acyltransferase, and malic enzyme have been examined during the adipose conversion of 3T3-F442A in surface culture and in suspension culture stabilized with methylcellulose. Glycerophosphate acyltransferase activity rises sharply during the conversion and reaches a level of 80 times higher than that of another 3T3 subline in which practically no adipose conversion takes place (3T3-C2). The activity of malic enzyme also rises during the adipose conversion of 3T3-F442A and reaches a level of 15-fold higher than that of 3T3-C2. The activity of glycerophosphate acyltransferase responds more sharply than that of malic enzyme but the rise in activity is not sustained as long, so that the relative levels of the two enzymes change during the conversion. The adipose conversion appears to be the result of increases in the activity of the synthesizing enzymes, brought about by either of the two most physiological methods available for arresting the growth of cultured cells."

This indicates that these cations permeate the calcium channels of the muscle fiber. By contrast, cobalt, nickel, and magnesium are nonpermeating and behave as competitive inhibitors of the permeation of the other divalent cations. Some of the permeating cations suppress delayed rectification."
https://openalex.org/W1501308626,"A method has been developed for the rapid large scale isolation of plasma membranes and intact nuclei from RAJI lymphoid cells utilizing hypotonic lysis of cells after intracellular loading with glycerol followed by combined flotation-sedimentation within a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Nuclei may be isolated in about 1 h and plasma membranes in about 6 h from 1 to 20 g of cells. Intact nuclei, obtained in 90 to 95% yield based on lysed cells, was isolated by differential centrifugation and contained 16% DNA and about 30% of total cell sialic acid. A crude plasma membrane fraction was isolated by centrifugation onto a cushion of 38% sucrose (d 1.1683) and subsequently resolved into two subfractions. The less dense vesicles had an average d 1.127 and showed a 7-fold increase in specific activity for thymidine phosphodiesterase while the more dense (d 1.151) had a 20-fold concentration of enzyme activity. Activity of enzymes indicative of contamination with lysosomes, microsomes, mitochondria, and cytoplasm was negligible in these plasma membrane fractions. The less dense vesicles had a cholesterol:phospholipid ratio of 0.97 which was higher than that of the more dense vesicles (0.69). Otherwise, the analytical values for the two types of membrane vesicles were similar as both fractions contained like percentages of protein (approximately 30%), lipid (approximately 30%), and carbohydrate (approximately 15%) with trace amounts of RNA and DNA. Twenty-five per cent of the total cell sialic acid was in the plasma membrane fractions."

https://openalex.org/W1532305521,"Calf pancreas microsomes incorporated radioactively labeled D-glucose from UDP-D-glucose into products extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), chloroform/methanol/water (10:102.5, v/v), and into the residual precipitate, with a pH optimum in Tris/maleate buffer of about 5.3. The chloroform/methanol extract contained a single 14C-labeled acidic product, which was identified as dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate. It was stable to mild alkali, yielded D-[14C]glucose upon mild acid hydrolysis, and a 14C-labeled compound with the chromatographic mobility of 1,6-anhydro-beta-D-glucopyranosyl upon hot alkali treatment. The [14C]glucolipid had the same chromatographic mobility as dolichyl beta-D-[14C]mannosyl phosphate, and its formation was stimulated by exogenous dolichyl phosphate. The chloroform/methanol/water extract contained radioactive lipid-bound oligosaccharides which were retained on DEAE-cellulose more strongly than dolichyl D-[14C]glucosyl phosphate. They were stable to mild alkali, but labile to acid and hot alkali. Acid treatment yielded a D-glucose-labeled oligosaccharide fraction which was shown by gel filtration to be slightly larger than most of the D-mannose-labeled oligosaccharides. About 80% of the radioactive D-glucose residues could be removed with alpha-glucosidase, but not with beta-glucosidase. Pancreatic dolichyl beta-D-[14C]glucosyl phosphate incubated with calf pancreas microsomes served as direct donor of D-glucosyl residues to lipid-bound oligosaccharides and to the precipitate. These oligosaccharides had the same size as those labeled from UDP-D-[14C]glucose, and the D-[14C]glucose residues could also be removed with alpha-glucosidase."
https://openalex.org/W2087279682,The regenerating liver produces erythropoietin in response to hypoxia. The amounts of erythropoietin produced in animals subjected to hepatectomy are significantly higher than those observed in sham-operated animals.

https://openalex.org/W1573036928,"Gel filtration and velocity sedimentation in sucrose gradients were used to determine the molecular weights of purified rat renal phosphate-dependent glutaminase. The purified glutaminase has a molecular weight of 160,000 in Tris or barbital buffers and forms dimers of 332,000 molecular weight in the presence of its activator, Pi. The correlation between activation and dimer formation was investigated by determining the sedimentation coefficient at various concentrations of glutaminase activators. Saturation curves for Pi and riboflavin phosphate demonstrate an excellent correlation between per cent activation and increasing S20,w with increasing concentrations of these activators. The concentrations required for half-maximal saturation were 40 to 50 mM for Pi and 10 to 15 mM for riboflavin phosphate. Correlation between activation and dimer formation was also found with other activators at subsaturating concentrations. Moreover, the activation and dimer formation were found to be reversed to a similar extent by increasing concentrations of NaCl. Finally, we studied the effects of Pi and NaCl on the stability of glutaminase activity at 37 degrees. Pi stabilized glutaminase activity by increasing the t1/2 for inactivation from 12 min in the absence of Pi to 242 at 150 mM Pi. The concentration of Pi which gave approximately half-maximal change in t1/2 was 50 mM and addition of NaCl reversed this stabilization. These results support the hypothesis that phosphate-dependent glutaminase is active only as a dimer or larger aggregate. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that binding of Pi changes the monomer conformation sufficiently to produce activation and that this new conformation leads to self-association."

https://openalex.org/W1542923946,"A beta-mannosidase (beta-D-mannoside mannohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.25) was purified to apparent homogeneity from the culture filtrate of the fungus, Aspergillus niger. The enzyme had an estimated molecular weight of about 120,000 and was a glycoprotein. Radioactive enzyme was prepared by growing the fungus in [14C]fructose, and this enzyme was used for the preparation of 14C-glycopeptides. The glycopeptides were purified on Sephadex G-25 and G-50 and were then hydrolyzed for sugar analysis. Two radioactive sugars were found in the glycopeptides and these were identified as mannose and glucosamine in a ratio of 2.5 or 3:1. Based on susceptibility of the enzyme to alkaline treatment and the formation of [3H]glucosaminitol in the presence of NaB3H4, the oligosaccharide is apparently attached to the protein in a GlcNAc-asparagine linkage. The beta-mannosidase had good activity on p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-mannoside but was inactive on p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-mannoside as well as on other p-nitrophenyl glycosides. It also showed good activity on the beta(1 leads to 4)-linked trisaccharide of mannose and somewhat lower activity of the corresponding disaccharide. With each of these substrates the Km was about 1 mM, whereas with the p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-mannoside the Km was about 2 mM. The beta-mannosidase also released [14C]mannose from the Man-GlcNAc-GlcNAc trisaccharide isolated from the lipid-linked oligosaccharides of aorta and released mannose from the disaccharides, Man-(beta1 leads to 4)GlcNAc and Man-(beta1 leads to 4)ManNAc. The pH optimum for the enzyme was about 3.5 to 4.0 in glycine or acetate buffer."

https://openalex.org/W1558457177,"Specific complementary DNAs (cDNAs) for the messenger RNAs coding for sheep alpha-, betaA-, betaB-, betaC-, and gamma-globins were prepared by thermal denaturation of heterologous hybrids (e.g. alphabetaB-cDNA-alphagamma-mRNA) followed by hydroxylapatite chromatography. Each cDNA represented a nearly full-length copy of its globin mRNA complement as determined by electrophoretic analysis in polyacrylamide gels containing 98% formamide. The purity of each cDNA fraction was estimated by hybridization analysis and thermal denaturation. The beta- and gamma-cDNAs contained 5 to 20% contaminating alpha-cDNA while the alpha-cDNA was 25 to 30% contaminated with non-alpha-cDNA. The melting temperatures (Tm) of homologous duplexes between each non-alpha chain cDNA and its mRNA complement ranged from 69.5-71.5 degrees in 50% formamide while alpha-alpha duplexes melted with a Tm of 75-76 degrees. The Tm values of heterologous duplexes formed between each non-alpha-cDNA and the various globin mRNAs (e.g. betaB-cDNA-Hb C mRNA) ranged between 64.5 degrees and 68 degrees and thus were only 1.5-5.0degrees below that of homologous duplexes. These results suggest that the nucleotide sequence divergence among the various non-alpha-mRNAs (or cDNAs) is not greatly different from the minimum predicted from the amino acid sequence differences of the corresponding globins. When annealing reactions were performed above the Tm of the heterologous hybrids (68 degrees), each non-alpha-cDNA hybridized only to its own complementary mRNA. Thus the purified cDNAs provide molecular probes for the quantitation of alpha-, beta-, and gamma-globin-specific nucleotide sequences."

The inhibitor is a heat-labile, sulfhydryl reagent-insensitive protein with a molecular weight of approximately 214,000. It inhibits protein synthesis at a step of peptide chain initiation by preventing initiation factor-dependent binding of methionyl-tRNAf to 40 S ribosomal subunits. However, it does not interfere with the formation of the ribosome-independent ternary complex between the initiation factor IF-E2, methionyl-tRNAf, and GTP. The inhibitor preparation contains protein kinase activity which phosphorylates the smallest subunit of IF-E2. There appears to be a functional similarity between this inhibitor from Friend leukemia cells and the hemin-controlled repressor from reticulocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1576630941,"The interactions of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) with normal human lymphocytes were studied utilizing radioiodinated leukoagglutinin (125I-LPHA) over a concentration spectrum encompassing the entire range of lymphocyte metabolic responses. 125I-LPHA binding was temperature-, pH-, and time-dependent. Ligand association was rapid with a t1/2 of 3 to 5 min, reaching steady state in 30 min at 22 degrees. Receptor specificity was demonstrated by the high receptor affinity for 125I-LPHA and by quantitative inhibition of 125I-LPHA binding with LPHA and 127I-LPHA but not with concanavalin A or bovine serum albumin. Under our experimental conditions there was no measurable degradation of 125I-LPHA and no detectable shedding of 125I-LPHA receptors or receptor-125I-LPHA complexes. Equilibrium studies of 125I-LPHA interactions with specific lymphocyte membrane receptors generated a complex curvilinear Scatchard plot. This, added to progressive deceleration of the dissociation reaction inversely proportional to receptor occupancy by 125I-LPHA, reflects changing receptor affinity for the ligand and suggests site-site interactions of the negative cooperativity type. These interactions which appear to be common to all lymphocyte subpopulations, preclude accurate calculation of lymphocyte binding capacity for 125I-LPHA and of physically meaningful affinity constants. Although the fate and role of a small fraction of apparently nondissociable 125I-LPHA remains to be elucidated, occupancy-dependent receptor affinity for 125I-LPHA, dissociation of receptor-125I-LPHA complexes, retention of binding properties by cell-exposed 125I-LPHA, and the large numbers of spare surface receptors for 125I-LPHA might represent important mechanisms for modulating cell activation by 125I-LPHA."

All three enzymes require NAD+ for activity, and all have a similar apparent molecular weight of approximately 40,000 as determined by gel filtration of the active enzymes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the liver and mammary epimerases revealed similar molecular weights of 37,000 for both enzymes thus indicating that neither protein was dimeric.

https://openalex.org/W1521937961,"Purified tubulin prepared from pig brain in the absence of added guanine nucleotides contains 1 mol each of GDP and GTP/mol of tubulin. Incubation of a tubulin preparation with inorganic [32P]phosphate results in the incorporation of 32P into tubulin-associated GDP and GTP. Typically, in a 5-h incubation, 0.45 mM 32Pi reacts with 22 muM tubulin to form 3.3 muM [32P]GDP, and 0.3 muM [32P]GTP. The yield of labeled nucleotide is decreased as the result of a hydrolase activity associated with the preparation. The [32P]GTP is exclusively beta-labeled and is therefore formed by phosphorylation of [32P]GDP by a phosphate donor other than inorganic phosphate, most likely by nonradioactive GTP. Added GDP significantly decreases the yield of labeled GTP, but increases the yield of labeled GDP in a manner that is consistent with a partial protection against [32P]GDP hydrolysis, but not consistent with significant additional [32P]GDP formation. Added GMP is an inhibitor of both labeling activities associated with the preparation, although it has no effect on the hydrolase activity. Added ADP (0.4 MM) does not form labeled ADP or ATP and does not influence the labeling of GDP or GTP. The formation of [32P]GDP was shown to occur by an exchange mechanism rather than through net synthesis from GMP and Pi. These results provide evidence for a reversible guanidylation of the protein. The labeling activity is always specifically associated with highly purified tubulin preparations. Microtubular protein preparations are found to catalyze an exchange of oxygen from H218O into inorganic phosphate. Thus, there are two distinct catalytic properties associated with tubulin."

The TCN-monophosphate is also excreted by the cells into the medium. It is released by a saturable process against a concentration gradient and the release is inhibited by various inhibitors of energy production. This inhibition correlates with a depletion of the cells of ATP. Thus TCN-monophosphate excretion probably involves an active transport system. This transport system is highly temperature-dependent (the Q10 falls between 3 and 4) and is inhibited by papaverine, theophylline, Persantin, Probenecid, phenethyl alcohol and p-chloromercuribenzoate, but not by 500 muM cyclic AMP, AMP, or adenosine.

Fifty to one hundred-fifty micrograms of RNA can be applied to the preparative gel and the recovery of the globin mRNA is about 50%. The isolated alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs were assayed in a wheat germ cell-free system, and the alpha- and beta-globin synthesized quantitated by cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The purified alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs direct globin synthesis which is more than 90% either alpha- or beta-globin, respectively.

The most active guanosine 5'-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl pyrophosphate):glycopeptide mannopyranosyltransferase (GPD-D-mannose mannosyltransferase) was found in two unresolved membrane fractions ( p congruent to 1.1 g/cm3). This preparation incorporated [14C]mannose from GDP-D-[14C]mannose both into endogenous acceptors and added peptidophosphogalactomannan. Mannosyltransferase activity is optimum at pH 7.0 in 0.05 M Tris/maleate buffer, and 17 mM Mn2+. Replacement of Mn2+ with Fe2+, Mg2, Co2+, Ca2+ or Ni2+ greatly reduced the mannosyltransferase activity. [14C]Mannose incorporation from GDP-D-[14C]mannose into acceptors is linearly dependent on enzyme concentration. Mannosyl incorporation into peptidophosphogalactomannan is linear for 3 h and continues for at least an additional 4 h. In contrast, the rate of mannosyl incorporation into endogenous acceptor(s) decreases after 60 min and there is no incorporation after 2 h. A series of possible acceptors related to peptidophosphogalactomannan were tested and it was found that treatment of peptidophosphogalactomannan with 0.01 N HCl at 100 degrees did not appreciably decrease the effectiveness of the acceptor even though this treatment removes the galactofuranosyl residues. In contrast, treatment of peptidophosphogalactomannan with 0.5 N NaOH rendered the products nearly incapable of accepting mannosyl residues from GDP-D-mannose. Derivation of peptidophosphogalactomannan with 2,4-dinitrobenzene also decreased its effectiveness as a mannosyl acceptor. [14C]Mannose from GDP-D-[14C]mannose was incorporated into both the oligosaccharide and phosphogalactomannan regions of peptidophosphogalactomannan. Treatment of the [14C]peptidophosphogalactomannan product, with 0.4 N NaOH released [14C]mannosyl-containing residues which eluted in the mannobiose and polysaccharide fractions from BIo-Gel P2. Approximately 90% of the 14C was in mannobiose. The [14C]mannose was shown to be transferred to the mannosyl-(seryl/threonyl) region of the acceptor. Acetolysis of [14C]peptidophosphogalactomannan resulted in the isolation of [14C]mannose, [14C]mannobiose, and [14C]polysaccharide. Small quantities of 14C were obtained in mannotriose and mannotetraose. The time course of [14C]mannose incorporation into the oligosaccharide region of peptidophosphogalactomannan showed a continual increase over a 4-h interval. In contrast, there was no major increase after 1 h in [14C]mannose incorporated into the polysaccharide region. The enzyme catalyzing incorporation of mannose into the polysaccharide region of peptidophosphogalactomannan was solubilized by treatment of the membranes with Triton X-100."
