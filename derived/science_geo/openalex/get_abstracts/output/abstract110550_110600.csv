https://openalex.org/W1995697852,"We demonstrate that missense mutations (Asp175Asn; Glu180Gly) in the alpha-tropomyosin gene cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) linked to chromosome 15q2. These findings implicated components of the troponin complex as candidate genes at other FHC loci, particularly cardiac troponin T, which was mapped in this study to chromosome 1q. Missense mutations (Ile79Asn; Arg92Gln) and a mutation in the splice donor sequence of intron 15 of the cardiac troponin T gene are also shown to cause FHC. Because alpha-tropomyosin and cardiac troponin T as well as beta myosin heavy chain mutations cause the same phenotype, we conclude that FHC is a disease of the sarcomere. Further, because the splice site mutation is predicted to function as a null allele, we suggest that abnormal stoichiometry of sarcomeric proteins can cause cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2092109378,"T lymphocyte activation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production require at least two signals, generated by phorbol ester (TPA) and Ca2+ ionophore or costimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) and the CD28 auxiliary receptor. We investigated how these stimuli affect mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases. Full activation of the MAP kinases that phosphorylate the Jun activation domain, JNK1 and JNK2, required costimulation of T cells with either TPA and Ca2+ ionophore or antibodies to TCR and CD28. Alone, each stimulus resulted in little or no activation. Similar to its effect on IL-2 induction, cyclosporin A (CsA) inhibited the synergistic activation of JNK, and a competitive inhibitor of Jun phosphorylation by JNK inhibited IL-2 promoter activation. By contrast, the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 were fully activated by TPA or TCR stimulation and were not affected by Ca2+, CD28, or CsA. Hence, integration of signals that lead to T cell activation occurs at the level of JNK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2164180561,"A mechanism by which the nerve growth factor (NGF) signal is transduced to the nucleus to induce gene expression has been characterized. An NGF-inducible, Ras-dependent protein kinase has been identified that catalyzes the phosphorylation of the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) at Ser-133. Phosphorylation of Ser-133 stimulates the ability of CREB to activate transcription in NGF-treated cells. These findings suggest that CREB has a more widespread function than previously believed and functions in the nucleus as a general mediator of growth factor responses."
https://openalex.org/W1560420809,"As a step toward elucidating the physiological role of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) in mediating estrogen action, we sought to determine the molecular basis of the phenomenon. In HepG2 cells expressing exogenous estrogen receptors (ER), a reporter gene plasmid containing 600 base pairs of the chicken IGF-I promoter enhanced expression of luciferase 8.6-fold in response to 10(-6) M 17 beta-estradiol, indicating that the IGF-I promoter is a target of estrogen regulation. Although no conventional estrogen-responsive element was identified within the promoter fragment, the AP-1 motif located therein was shown to be essential; the estrogen-responsive enhancement of the Fos-Jun binding to the AP-1 motif, which takes place by means of post-translational modification, mediates the estrogen action. A direct or indirect interaction between the estrogen-ER complex and the Fos-Jun complex seems to facilitate the Fos-Jun binding to the target DNA. Although ER binding to the target DNA was not considered to be involved in the signaling pathway, the DNA binding domain-deficient ER did not mediate the phenomenon, providing support for the existence of a unique function of the DNA binding domain of ER in facilitating some protein-protein interaction. In conclusion, our present observations demonstrate that the chicken IGF-I gene promoter is controlled by estrogen through a unique pathway involving Fos, Jun, and the DNA binding domain of ER."
https://openalex.org/W1514724839,"Neurotransmitter transporters determine the intensity and duration of signal transduction by controlling the rapid removal of transmitter molecules from the synaptic cleft. The importance of their function is further reflected by the medical and social implications of compounds that inhibit their activity such as the antidepressants and cocaine. Molecular characterization of these transporters has revealed that they are members of a large family of membrane proteins with 12 putative transmembrane domains. However, little information exists as to whether discrete domains of these proteins mediate the various defined functions of these transporters. In this study, we constructed a series of chimeras between two structurally related but pharmacologically distinct transporters, the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. The properties of these chimeric transporters suggest that distinct regions of these molecules determine these individual functions. Regions from the amino-terminal through the first five transmembrane domains are likely to be involved in the uptake mechanisms and ionic dependence. Regions within transmembrane domains 6-8 determine tricyclic antidepressant binding and cocaine interactions, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region encompassing transmembrane domain 9 through the COOH-terminal tail appears to be responsible for the stereoselectivity and high affinity for substrates. The dissociation of the substrate uptake and cocaine binding properties of these transporters further raises the possibility that antagonists of cocaine action devoid of uptake blockade activity might be developed for the clinical management of cocaine addiction."
https://openalex.org/W2081381862,"We replaced the IgH 3' enhancer (3'EH) region with a neomycin resistance gene in ES cells and generated chimeric mice in which all mature lymphocytes were either heterozygous (3'EH+/-) or homozygous (3'EH-/-) for the mutation. In vitro activated 3'EH-/- B cells responded similarly to 3'EH+/- B cells with respect to proliferation and secretion of IgM and IgG1 but were specifically deficient in IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgE secretion. These isotype deficiencies correlated with a deficiency in accumulation of transcripts from and class switching to affected CH genes. In vivo, chimeric mice containing only 3'EH-/- B cells were deficient in serum IgG2a and IgG3. We propose that the 3'EH-/- mutation disrupts the activity of a regulatory region that influences heavy chain class switching to several different CH genes that lie as far as 100 kb upstream of the mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2134935936,"We report that a variety of transactivators stimulate elongation by RNA polymerase II. Activated transcription complexes have high processivity and are able to read through pausing and termination sites efficiently. In contrast, nonactivated and ""squelched"" transcription mostly arrests prematurely. Activators differ in the extent to which they stimulate processivity; for example, GAL4-VP16 and GAL4-E1a are more effective than GAL4-AH. The stimulation of elongation can be as important as the stimulation of initiation in activating expression of a reporter gene. We suggest that setting the competence of polymerase II to elongate is an integral part of the initiation step that is controlled by activators cooperating with the general transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W1601999342,"Double-strand DNA break repair is important in maintaining the genetic integrity of the genome. Using a mobility shift assay, we find that a protein, or complex of proteins, that is present in mammalian and yeast cells binds to the ends of double-strand DNA and renders the ends resistant to exonuclease digestion. Additionally, a mammalian DNA double-strand repair-deficient mutant, xrs, has no observable DNA end binding activity, while a revertant cell has wild-type activity. In addition, mobility supershift assays using monoclonal antibodies to the human Ku antigen (M(r) 70,000 subunit) reveal that one of the proteins of this end binding activity may be the Ku antigen or a protein with similar antigenic determinants. These observations suggest that this DNA end-binding protein may function in DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1666643260,"Structure-activity relationships of human interleukin-8 (IL-8) were probed using chemically synthesized analogs with single or double amino acid substitutions, as well as hybrids derived by substituting IL-8 regions into IP10, a related protein that lacks IL-8 activity. The analogs were tested for functional activity by measuring induction of elastase release from human neutrophils and competition for binding of radiolabeled IL-8. The hybrid studies indicated that Gly31 and Pro32, as well as the NH2-terminal region from IL-8 are required to convert IP10 into a fully functional protein, suggesting that these elements are critical for IL-8 activity. Both disulfide bridges, linking residue 7 to 34 and residue 9 to 50, were critical for function, as shown by substituting the cysteine pairs with alpha-aminobutyric acid. Single conservative substitutions were generally accepted into the 10-22 region of IL-8, which contrasts with the ELR motif (residues 4-6), previously shown to be essential for activity. The importance of residues within the 10-15 region and the 17-22 region was demonstrated with hybrids. In addition, some of the 4-22 residues have structural roles that may be important; for example, Tyr13, Phe17, and Phe21 are involved in aromatic interactions in the IL-8 structure, and are also moderately sensitive to modification. Except for Cys50, the results argue against a role for the 36-72 region, including the COOH-terminal alpha-helix, in receptor binding. We conclude that the disulfide bridges and 30-35 turn provide a structural scaffold for the NH2-terminal region which includes the primary receptor-binding site (the ELR motif) and secondary binding and conformational determinants between residues 10 and 22."
https://openalex.org/W1530505052,"Cleavage of the thrombin receptor's amino-terminal exodomain at the Arg41/Ser42 peptide bond within the sequence ... LDPR41/S42FLLRN ... is necessary and sufficient for receptor activation by proteases. The synthetic peptide SFLLRN activates the receptor independent of proteolysis. We proposed that the SFLLRN sequence is a tethered peptide ligand; receptor cleavage unmasks this agonist which then binds intramolecularly to effect receptor activation. The alternative hypothesis that receptor cleavage or exogenous SFLLRN effect receptor activation by disrupting tonic inhibitory interactions exerted by the receptor's amino-terminal exodomain has not been excluded. We report that delta AMINO, a mutant thrombin receptor lacking the amino-terminal exodomain, was not constitutively active and responded to SFLLRN but not thrombin when expressed in Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells. Thrombin signaling was restored when delta AMINO was co-expressed with ATE-CD8 which encoded the receptor's amino-terminal exodomain fused to the transmembrane domain of CD8. Co-expression of a thrombin receptor lacking a functional tethered ligand domain (F43A) with a non-signaling receptor mutant bearing an intact tethered ligand domain (YYY) also reconstituted thrombin signaling. However, the EC50 for thrombin activation of cells co-expressing F43A and YYY was > 1000-fold that for cells expressing comparable levels of wild type receptor, while EC50s for activation by SFLLRN were similar. These and other data refute the release from inhibition hypothesis and suggest that while intermolecular liganding between two thrombin receptor molecules can occur, the intramolecular tethered liganding mechanism is the predominant mode of thrombin receptor activation."
https://openalex.org/W1564804005,"Unique roles have been identified for the histone octamer in the formation and stabilization of higher order chromatin structures. Histone octamers were assembled onto 12 tandem repeats of Lytechinus 5 S rDNA, at either saturating or subsaturating ratios. The extent of oligonucleosome folding and intermolecular association in divalent salts was monitored using analytical and differential sedimentation techniques. Saturated oligonucleosomes (12 nucleosomes/DNA) sedimented at 29 S in very low salt buffer. In 1.0-2.0 mM MgCl2, saturated oligonucleosomes formed a maximally folded 55 S structure whose extent of compaction was equivalent to that of classical higher order 30-nm diameter chromatin structures. These results are in marked contrast to those obtained previously in NaCl, where the maximally folded oligonucleosome species sedimented at only approximately 40 S (Hansen, J. C., Ausio, J., Stanik, V. H., and van Holde, K. E. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 9129-9136). Mg(2+)-dependent formation of the 55 S conformation was inhibited by histone octamer depletion; the maximum sedimentation coefficient observed for rDNA molecules containing 10-11 nucleosomes in 2.0 mM MgCl2 was only 40 S. Above 2.0 mM MgCl2, the equilibrium was progressively shifted toward formation of large associated oligonucleosome species. The implications of these results to the mechanism of chromatin folding and its relationship to the biological activity of the chromatin fiber are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1529429589,"Src homology 3 (SH3) domains are found in a variety of proteins that are involved in signal transduction or represent components of the cytoskeleton. These domains are thought to serve as modules that mediate specific protein-protein interactions that include proline-rich sequences on the target protein. We have identified proteins of 110, 80, 65, and 43 kDa in human embryonic fibroblasts that bind specifically to the SH3 domain of phospholipase C gamma, a primary substrate of receptor tyrosine kinases, and characterized the 110-kDa band as the microtubule-activated GTPase dynamin. In addition, dynamin binds the son of sevenless adaptor protein GRB-2 with even higher affinity. This interaction does not require the dynamin GTPase function and involves a proline-rich target sequence between residues 812 and 820 of dynamin."
https://openalex.org/W1551668099,"R(+)-Lipoic acid is a cofactor required for function of the alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase and glycine cleavage enzyme complexes. The naturally occurring form of lipoate is attached by amide linkage to the epsilon-amino group of a specific lysine residue within conserved lipoate-accepting protein domains. Lipoate-protein ligase(s) catalyze the formation of this amide bond between lipoyl groups and specific apoproteins. We report the isolation of the lplA gene which encodes an Escherichia coli lipoate-protein ligase. Strains with lplA null mutations transport lipoic acid normally but have severe defects in the incorporation and utilization of exogenously supplied lipoic acid and lipoic acid analogs. These strains are also highly resistant to selenolipoate (a growth-inhibiting lipoate analog) and contain no detectable lipoate-protein ligase activity in cell extracts. The lplA gene has been cloned, sequenced, and physically mapped to min 99.6 (4657 kilobases) of the E. coli chromosome. Upon overexpression, the 38-kDa lplA gene product was purified to homogeneity and shown to have a mass, N-terminal sequence and amino acid composition consistent with the deduced 337 residue primary sequence. Enzyme assays show that purified LplA catalyzes the ATP-dependent attachment of [35S]lipoic acid to apoprotein, thus confirming that lplA encodes lipoate-protein ligase A. Analysis of lplA null mutants also indicates the existence of a second (lplA-independent) lipoyl-ligase enzyme in E. coli. This is the first identification of a lipoate ligase gene and the first analysis of a purified lipoate ligase enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1514540426,"Several mammalian genes expressed in late G1 are positively regulated by E2F, a heterodimeric transcription factor. Genes encoding two E2F proteins, E2F-1 and DP-1, were regulated differently during the cell cycle and replicative senescence of normal human fibroblasts. In presenescent cells, E2F-1 mRNA was cell-cycle regulated, appearing a few hours before S phase. By contrast, DP-1 mRNA was constitutively expressed, independent of position in the cell cycle. After a finite number of divisions, normal cells enter a state of irreversible growth arrest termed senescence. Many genes remain mitogen-inducible in senescent cells; there are, however, exceptions, including several late G1 genes potentially regulated by E2F. Senescent cells expressed DP-1 at the presenescent level, but did not express E2F-1 mRNA. Senescent cells were also markedly deficient in E2F binding activity associated with the dihydrofolate reductase promoter. E2F-1 and DP-1 expression vectors only weakly induced DNA synthesis in quiescent or senescent human cells and immortal murine NIH3T3 cells, although the E2F-1 vector stimulated DNA synthesis in immortal murine A31 cells, and transactivated E2F-responsive promoters in NIH3T3 cells. The results suggest that senescent cells may fail to express late G1 genes due to repression of E2F-1, leading to a deficiency of E2F activity. Furthermore, although E2F-1 stimulates DNA synthesis in some cells, other cells, including normal human fibroblasts, require additional factors."
https://openalex.org/W1584284659,"The cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) of retinal rod outer segments (ROS) is activated by the GTP-bound form of the G protein, transducin (Gt alpha). This activation can be reversed by the inhibitory gamma subunit of PDE through two distinct mechanisms: acceleration of GTP hydrolysis and direct inactivation independent of GTP hydrolysis. We have found that acceleration of Gt alpha GTPase by PDE gamma does not occur upon formation of a Gt alpha PDE gamma complex but rather reflects enhanced activity toward this complex of a membrane-bound GTPase accelerating protein. GTPase rate constants for Gt alpha in the presence of 3.3 microM PDE gamma were as high as 0.7 s-1 with hypotonically washed ROS membranes at 40 microM rhodopsin but were more than 10-fold lower when protein-free vesicles containing ROS lipids were substituted for ROS membranes. Acceleration of Gt alpha GTPase by PDE gamma was also barely detectable at low ROS concentrations (e.g. 4 microM rhodopsin) or if ROS treated with trypsin or urea were used. GTPase-independent inactivation by PDE gamma occurred efficiently at much lower membrane concentrations. Inhibition of Gt alpha-activated PDE was much slower than inhibition of PDE alpha beta by PDE gamma. Effects of PDE gamma upon successive additions of GTP suggested formation of a complex of PDE gamma and Gt alpha-GDP that is refractory to reactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1531981873,"We have purified a novel endonuclease from Escherichia coli that recognizes deoxyinosine, a deamination product of deoxyadenosine in DNA. This activity, which we named deoxyinosine 3' endonuclease, is different from the known hypoxanthine DNA N-glycosylases which have been partially characterized in E. coli and other organisms. The enzyme was purified 24,800-fold to apparent homogeneity. SDS- and activity PAGE analyses indicate that the enzyme has an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa. Deoxyinosine 3' endonuclease recognized deoxyinosine in both single- and double-stranded DNA but exhibited a 4-fold preference for double stranded over single-stranded DNA. In addition to deoxyinosine, the enzyme recognized urea residues and AP sites. Deoxyinosine 3' endonuclease has an obligatory requirement for Mg2+, but other cations such as Co2+ and Mn2+ could partially replace Mg2+. The optimal pH for deoxyinosine 3' endonuclease was around 7.5. In contrast to most of the known repair enzymes, deoxyinosine 3' endonuclease makes an incision at the second phosphodiester bond 3' to a deoxyinosine or AP site, leaving behind the intact lesion on the nicked DNA. Therefore, deoxyinosine 3' endonuclease recognizes, but does not remove, the lesion from the DNA molecule. The biological significance of this novel activity is discussed with reference to other repair activities in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1501041796,"Src homology 3 (SH3) domains direct cellular localization and signal transduction through specific protein-protein interactions with proline-rich target sequences. The two SH3 domain in p67-phox, a cytosolic component of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system, may mediate interactions within the oxidase complex and direct its translocation to membranes. The requirement for SH3 domains in p67-phox was studied both in cell-free and whole cell oxidase assay systems. The amino-terminal domain of p67-phox (amino acids 1-246) that lacks both SH3 domains was active in vitro. Various forms of p67-phox lacking one or both SH3 domains were produced in whole cells using episomal expression vectors to stably transfect p67-phox-deficient Epstein-Barr virus-B cells derived from chronic granulomatous disease patients. Complete restoration of NADPH oxidase activity was achieved with full-length p67-phox cDNA expression. Deletion of either SH3 domain resulted in dramatic reductions of NADPH oxidase activity relative to corrected transfected cells, which correlated with decreases in membrane binding. Deletion of both SH3 domains completely abolished p67-phox membrane binding and oxidase activity. Thus, in contrast to oxidase reconstitution in a cell-free system, we observed a requirement for both SH3 motifs for restoration of oxidase activity and binding of p67-phox to membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1525281502,"Cytochrome P450IA1 is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-responsive monooxygenase enzyme with no known endogenous inducer or substrate. We investigated the effect of suspension on P450IA1 gene (CYP1A1) expression in cultured human keratinocytes without the addition of xenobiotics. To prohibit adhesion and trigger differentiation, human keratinocytes or dermal fibroblasts were suspended in medium made semisolid with methylcellulose. Following suspension, we observed dramatic increases (> 100-fold) in steady state P450IA1 mRNA in keratinocytes within 1 h; however, dermal fibroblasts were nonresponsive. This effect was not dependent on methylcellulose itself and could be achieved by suspension in medium alone or in Percoll solution. The induction of P450IA1 mRNA was independent of exogenous calcium or serum concentrations, agents commonly used to signal differentiation. Adherent keratinocytes overlaid with methylcellulose exhibited slight morphological changes accompanied by increased P450IA1 mRNA. The activity of the P450IA1 enzyme was found to parallel Northern analysis data. Changes in keratinocyte adhesion or shape also affect other PAH-responsive genes suggesting Ah receptor involvement. We report a novel mechanism for cell type-specific induction of CYP1A1 expression without the addition of xenobiotic inducers. These findings suggest a possible endogenous role for P450IA1 in stratified squamous epithelia."
https://openalex.org/W1509118036,"The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone regulates tight junction permeability resulting in an increased transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of cultured 31EG4 mammary epithelial cells. Inhibition of cellular type 1 and type 2A protein phosphatase activity by okadaic acid reduced the TER of dexamethasone-treated monolayers of 31EG4 cells to basal levels within 24 h. Coincident with the increase in tight junction permeability, immunofluorescence revealed that okadaic acid caused a partial cellular redistribution of the ZO-1 tight junction-associated protein. The potent glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 had no effect on TER or ZO-1 distribution, indicating that the effects of okadaic acid are not a result of disrupting glucocorticoid receptor function. Immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled cells and V8 protease peptide mapping demonstrated that dexamethasone did not alter ZO-1 phosphorylation. However, consistent with the changes in TER, dexamethasone induced a 2.3-fold stimulation in ZO-1 protein levels which was reduced to 73% of basal levels by okadaic acid. No effects on ZO-1 transcript levels were observed. Monolayers grown in the presence of glucocorticoids had only 28% less junction density and 16.5% more linear junction/cell, which cannot account for the observed increases of TER and ZO-1 protein levels. Taken together, our results have shown that a disruption of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation activity overrides the glucocorticoid regulation of tight junction permeability in 31EG4 mammary cells."
https://openalex.org/W1546437342,"Complementation group G of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP-G) is one of the most rare and phenotypically heterogeneous forms of this inherited disorder. XP-G patients vary from having a very mild defect in DNA repair to being severely affected, and a few cases are also associated with the neurological complications of Cockayne's syndrome. The XPG gene encodes an acidic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 133 kDa that confers normal UV resistance when expressed in XP-G cells. Here we report the isolation of full-length XPG as a soluble protein expressed from a recombinant baculovirus. The purified polypeptide corrects the DNA nucleotide excision repair defect of XP-G cell extracts in vitro, and it acts as a magnesium-dependent single-stranded DNA endonuclease. This is the first direct evidence for a human protein with properties that implicate it in the incision step of nucleotide excision repair."
https://openalex.org/W1540324344,"Abstract Band 3 Memphis is a commonly occurring polymorphic form of the human red cell anion transporter (band 3, AE1). Band 3 Memphis migrates more slowly on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel than normal band 3 and results from a point mutation Lys56-->Glu. Two types of band 3 Memphis, variants I and II, can be distinguished by their susceptibility to covalent labeling with H2DIDS (4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-dihydrostilbene disulfonate). Memphis variant II is more readily labeled than Memphis variant I or normal band 3. The Memphis variant II is also associated with the presence of the Diego (Dia) blood group antigen on the red cells. We have shown that Memphis variant II carries the polymorphism Pro854-->Leu, as well as Lys56-->Glu. The blood group antigen (Dia) present at the surface of Memphis variant II type red cells suggests the mutation Pro854-->Leu causes a change in the structure of an extracellular loop of Memphis variant II band 3. We discuss possible ways in which the mutation Pro854-->Leu affects the reactivity of Lys539 to covalent reaction with H2DIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2074041350,"There are cells scattered in the rear, prespore region of the Dictyostelium slug that share many of the properties of the prestalk cells and that are therefore called anterior-like cells (ALCs). By placing the gene encoding a cell surface protein under the control of an ALC-specific promoter and immunologically labeling the living cells, we analyze the movement of ALCs within the slug. There is a posterior to anterior cellular flow, and the ALCs change their movement pattern as they enter the prestalk zone. Prestalk cells are periodically shed from the migrating slug. They must be replaced if the correct ratio of prestalk to prespore cells is to be maintained, and we present evidence for the transdifferentiation of prespore into prestalk cells, with ALCs functioning as intermediates in the transition. The slug has, therefore, a surprisingly dynamic structure, both with respect to cellular differentiation and cell movement."
https://openalex.org/W1672623210,"Elevated levels of the human pi class glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1-1) have been implicated in the development of antineoplastic drug resistance. Using GSTP1 promoter deletion constructs we have shown that enhanced GSTP1 transcription (up to 18-fold) is the predominant mechanism responsible for increased GSTP1-1 levels in a multidrug resistant derivative (VCREMS) of the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF7. Furthermore, disruption of a putative AP-1 response element within the GSTP1 promoter (nucleotides -69 to -63) abrogated GSTP1 transcription in both cell lines. In addition, band shift assays demonstrated binding of a VCREMS nuclear complex to the promoter region C1 (-73 to -54) which could be competed for by a DNA fragment containing a known AP-1 binding site from the human collagenase promoter. However, no such competition was observed for the major MCF7 C1 complex. The role of a Fos-Jun-like complex in regulating GSTP1 transcription in VCREMS cells was further emphasized by the introduction of point mutations within the C1 region which were known to inhibit AP-1 binding and the interaction of antisera raised against human c-Jun and c-Fos with the major C1 complex in VCREMS cells. These studies therefore highlight cell-specific differences in the binding pattern of Jun and Fos proteins to the GSTP1 promoter which are likely to play an important role in regulating transcriptional activation of the GSTP1 gene in drug-resistant breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1496817660,"The three psbA genes encoding the photosystem II D1 protein in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 respond differentially to an increase in intensity of white light through transcriptional induction of psbAII and psbAIII and accelerated degradation of psbAI and psbAIII messages. We report that the genes exhibit a novel photoreversible response involving blue and red light that is almost indistinguishable from the high-white light response. Transfer of cells from white to low-fluence blue light caused a decrease in the level of the psbAI message and increased levels of psbAII and psbAIII messages, whereas transfer to red or far-red light had little effect. Five min of blue light was sufficient to trigger psbAII and psbAIII induction; five min of subsequent red irradiation attenuated this response, whereas subsequent green or far-red light (or darkness) had no effect. Response to both high and blue light was insensitive to inhibitors of photosynthetic electron transport. We propose that Synechococcus modulates photosystem II biosynthesis in a variable light environment through a photoreception signal pathway, which is independent of photosystem II activity and which is distinct from red/green-reversible control of chromatically adapting cyanobacteria and the red/far-red-reversible phytochrome of plants."
https://openalex.org/W1519419895,"A procedure is described for the isolation of calmodulin (CaM) from rat liver which produces a fraction containing non-phosphorylated, mono-, di-, and triphosphocalmodulin as determined by mass spectrometric analysis. The distribution of CaM between the various phospho-species varies from preparation to preparation even though the isolation procedure is rigidly defined, suggesting that CaM phosphorylation may be a very labile phenomenon dependent on the state of the liver as it is removed from the animal. Approximately 15% of CaM in the cell is phosphorylated. The in vivo phosphorylation sites were determined by mass spectrometric analysis of a combined CNBr and trypsin digestion of the phosphocalmodulin (phospho-CaM)-containing fractions. Phosphorylated peptides were sequenced using two mass scanning devices linked together for collisionally activated fragmentation studies to determine peptide sequences, and the phosphorylation sites were determined as Thr-79, Ser-81, and Ser-101. These correspond to three of the four in vitro target sites of calmodulin phosphorylation by casein kinase II, which indicates that this may be the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation in vivo. A preliminary study on the modulatory activity of phosphorylated calmodulin using a sample extensively phosphorylated in vitro with casein kinase II confirmed that phospho-CaM has an altered biological activity, i.e. reduced activation of the erythrocyte plasma membrane Ca2+ pump."
https://openalex.org/W1578452610,"Synthetic peptides (30 and 20 residues long) corresponding to the native MUC1 tandem repeat sequence (20 residues long) were glycosylated in vitro using UDP-[3H]GalNAc and lysates from the human breast tumor cell line MCF7. Purified glycopeptides were sequenced on a gas-phase sequenator, and glycosylated positions were determined by measuring the incorporated radioactivity in fractions collected following each round of Edman degradation. The results showed that 2 of 3 threonines on the MUC1 tandem repeat peptides were glycosylated at the following positions: GVTSAPDTRPAPGSTAPPAH (underlined Thr residues indicate positions of GalNAc attachment); no glycosylation of serine residues was detected. Determination of the mass of the glycopeptides by mass spectrometry showed that a maximum of two molecules of GalNAc were covalently linked to each 20-residue repeat unit in the peptides. The influence of substrate primary amino acid sequence in determining the substrate specificity of UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase activity was evaluated using as acceptor substrates a series of overlapping 9-residue peptides that represent a moving set through the tandem repeat of the MUC1 mucin. In addition, the influence of primary amino acid sequence on acceptor substrate activity was evaluated using several peptides that contained single or double amino acid substitutions (relative to the native human MUC1 sequence). These included substitutions in the residues that were glycosylated and substitutions in the surrounding primary amino acid sequence. This study demonstrates that primary amino acid sequence, length, and relative position of the residue to be glycosylated dramatically affect the ability of peptides to serve as acceptor substrates for UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase."

The RNA chain growth rates were calculated from the time lag between induction of transcription and the appearance of specific hybridization to probes complementary to the 3' ends of the genes, i.e. from the transcription time. The rate of mRNA chain elongation responded differently in rel+ and relA strains exposed to isoleucine starvation as it decreased (approximately 50%) in rel+ strains that accumulated high concentrations of guanosine 3',5'-bisdiphosphate (ppGpp) and increased (approximately 15%) the relA mutant whose ppGpp pool decayed during starvation. These results show that ppGpp inhibits mRNA chain elongation in vivo. However, stable RNA chain elongation appeared unaffected by ppGpp pool size and was twice as fast as mRNA chain elongation in exponentially growing cells."
https://openalex.org/W1494661462,"Abstract Cytosine arabinoside monophosphate (araCMP) at the 3' terminus of DNA constitutes a lesion that impedes further synthesis by DNA polymerase alpha (DNA pol alpha). A biochemical assay has been designed to detect 3'-->5'-exonucleases in cell extracts that remove the 3'-araCMP lesion in an oligonucleotide template-primer and permit subsequent extension by DNA pol alpha. The major 3'-->5'-exonuclease activity in human myeloblast extracts has been purified, and gel filtration chromatography of the purified enzyme indicates that the exonuclease has an apparent native molecular mass of 52 kDa. Incubation of the enzyme with a 5'-32P-labeled araCMP template-primer results in exonucleolytic degradation of the primer exclusively in the 3'-->5' direction, demonstrating that the enzyme is a 3'-->5'-exonuclease. The products of the 3'-->5'-exonuclease reaction are 5'-mononucleotides. The apparent rate of araCMP removal by the exonuclease is approximately the same as the rate of deoxynucleoside monophosphate (dNMP) removal. Furthermore, the apparent rates of 3'-terminal excision are approximately the same whether the oligomer is hybridized to a complementary oligonucleotide, or not, indicating that the enzyme has both single- and double-stranded 3'-->5'-exonuclease activity. The enzyme does not possess 5'-->3'-exonuclease activity, nor is it associated with DNA polymerase activity. In addition, the enzyme does not cleave 3'-phosphoryl-terminated DNA, and it does not cleave RNA. The enzymatic characteristics of the isolated 3'-->5'-exonuclease indicate that it is distinct from previously identified mammalian deoxyribonucleases."
https://openalex.org/W1566041529,"The alpha 2A-adrenergic receptor (alpha 2AAR) is polarized to the basolateral membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells via direct targeting. Examination of mutant alpha 2AAR reveals that direct delivery is independent of NH2-terminal glycosylation, COOH-terminal acylation, or protein sequences within the large third cytoplasmic loop or COOH-terminal tail. Combined mutation of these structural features also does not perturb alpha 2AAR delivery, suggesting that a three-dimensional structure imparted by non-contiguous endofacial sequences does not confer alpha 2AAR targeting and that motifs in or near the bilayer must be involved in targeting of the alpha 2AAR. Mutation of a conserved Asp residue in transmembrane two that alters receptor-G-protein interactions also does not impair alpha 2AAR targeting. Finally, modification of sequences in transmembrane seven that resemble tyrosine-containing endocytosis motifs utilized for targeting by some proteins does not perturb alpha 2AAR sorting. Interestingly, deletion of the large third cytoplasmic loop of the alpha 2AAR decreases receptor half-life on the basolateral surface from approximately 11 to 4.5 h without altering the ability of the alpha 2AAR to couple to G-proteins. These data suggest that although targeting of the alpha 2AAR likely involves bilayer sequences, the third cytoplasmic loop may contain structural features that promote stabilization of the alpha 2AAR on the basolateral surface of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells."
https://openalex.org/W1569718989,"To examine the in vivo effects of a kinase-deficient mutant human insulin receptor, we used the muscle creatine kinase promoter to express a putative dominant-negative receptor: Ala1134-->Thr (Moller, D. E., Yokota, A., White, M. F., Pazianos, A. G., and Flier, J. S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14979-14985) in transgenic mice. Two lines were generated, where receptor expression was restricted to striated muscle and was increased by 5-12-fold in skeletal muscle. Transgenic gluteal muscle insulin receptor kinase activity was reduced by approximately 80% after maximal in vitro insulin stimulation. Glycogen content in this muscle was reduced by 45% in transgenic mice. Insulin levels were approximately 2-fold higher, and glucose concentrations were 12% higher in transgenics fed ad libitum. Transgenic mice exhibited reduced in vivo sensitivity to low dose (0.1 milliunits/g) intravenous insulin. In isolated soleus muscles from transgenics, where mutant receptors were expressed at lower levels, insulin-stimulated receptor kinase activity was reduced by 42%, but insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake was unaffected. These results indicate that (i) overexpression of a kinase-deficient human insulin receptor in muscle causes dominant-negative effects at the level of receptor kinase activation, (ii) impairment of insulin-stimulated muscle receptor tyrosine kinase activity can cause decreased insulin sensitivity in vivo, (iii) kinase-defective receptor mutants may be used to create novel animal models of tissue-specific insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W1536736330,"The cDNA encoding GM2 activator was expressed in the Escherichia coli/pT7-7 system. The yield of the GM2 activator with greater than 99% purity was about 3 mg per liter culture. The recombinant GM2 activator was found to be as active as that isolated from human kidney. The availability of the recombinant GM2 activator enabled us to critically examine the specificity of this activator protein. Our results show that the specificity of GM2 activator is not as strict as that reported previously. Although GM2 activator stimulates most efficiently the degradation of GM2 carried out by beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (Hex A), this activator also stimulates the following reactions: (a) conversion of GM2 to GA2 by clostridial sialidase; (b) hydrolysis of GalNAc from dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine-II3NeuAcGgOse3 by Hex A; and (c) liberation of Gal from GM1 by beta-galactosidase at a high activator concentration. Thus, this activator does not differentiate between GM2 and dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine-II3NeuAcGgOse3 or between Hex A and clostridial sialidase. The micellar forms of GD2 and GalNAc-GD1a were found to be more readily hydrolyzed by Hex A than GM2 in the absence of GM2 activator. Our results also show that saposin B can enhance the stimulatory activity of GM2 activator, but it cannot promote the stimulatory activity of sodium taurodeoxycholate. Taken together, our results suggest that the mechanism of action of GM2 activator is different from saposin B, and the action of GM2 activator is more than to solubilize lipid substrates. The effectiveness of GM2 activator in stimulating the hydrolysis of GM2 may be due to its ability to recognize the specific trisaccharide structure of the GM2 epitope, GalNAc beta 1-->4(NeuAc alpha 2-->3)Gal-, and to modify the GalNAc-NeuAc interaction in this structure."
https://openalex.org/W1911468191,"A recombinant human prothrombin was prepared in which Arg155 was replaced by Ala. The recombinant prothrombin was converted into a meizothrombin derivative (R155A meizothrombin) that was resistant to autocatalytic removal of the fragment 1 domain. R155A meizothrombin appeared to be a potent factor V activator in reaction mixtures that contained negatively charged phospholipid vesicles. Factor V activation by R155A meizothrombin was characterized by second-order rate constants of 0.06 x 10(6) M-1 S-1 in the absence of phospholipid and 18 x 10(6) M-1 S-1 in the presence of 60 microM phospholipid vesicles composed of a 10:90 mol/mol mixture of phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). The rate constant for thrombin-catalyzed activation of factor V was hardly affected by the presence of phospholipid vesicles and was 4.0 x 10(6) M-1 S-1. The initial rate of activation of 3 nM factor V by R155A meizothrombin was a function of the concentration of PS/PC vesicles present in the reaction mixture, and the calculated rate constant reached a plateau value at > or = 50 microM PS/PC. Gel electrophoretic analysis of factor V activation showed that R155A meizothrombin and thrombin cleaved the susceptible peptide bonds in factor V at different rates. However, both activators finally generated a factor Va molecule composed of a heavy chain with an M(r) of 104,000 and a light chain doublet with M(r) values of 74,000 and 71,000. Since meizothrombin is one of the major reaction products formed during the initial phase of prothrombin activation, these findings are indicative of a significant contribution of meizothrombin to in vivo factor V activation."
https://openalex.org/W1511329337,"The type I iodothyronine 5'-deiodinase (5'-DI) present in rat liver and kidney has recently been demonstrated to be a selenoprotein. The goal of the present study was to examine in detail the effect of selenium (Se) deficiency on 5'-DI at the protein and mRNA levels. In weanling rats fed a selenium-deficient (Se(-)) diet for 6 weeks, 5'-DI activity was decreased 91 and 69% relative to control activities in liver and kidney, respectively. Administration of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine resulted in a 2-fold increase in 5'-DI activity in control animals, but had little or no effect on 5'-DI activity in Se(-) animals. Western analysis using a specific antiserum directed against a bacterial fusion protein containing the carboxyl-terminal half of the 5'-DI protein demonstrated that this decrease in 5'-DI activity in Se(-) animals was explained by a marked decrease in 5'-DI protein. Administration of Se to Se(-) animals resulted in parallel increases in 5'-DI protein and activity over a 72-h time period. It was also shown that selenium deficiency was accompanied by a 40% decrease in 5'-DI mRNA levels in the kidney, but not in the liver. In both tissues, the administration of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine resulted in increased 5'-DI mRNA levels which were not altered by selenium status. These studies indicate that selenium deficiency decreases 5'-DI activity by decreasing the amount of 5'-DI protein. The mechanism of this impairment in enzyme synthesis appears to be a defect in translation, presumably due to a block in the UGA-directed selenocysteine incorporation in selenium deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1546832385,"The inhibitory effect of short antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (aODNs) on cRNA expression in Xenopus oocytes was measured using an electrophysiological assay based on subunit-specific block of cloned alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate receptors. The effect of both phosphorothioate-modified (PS) and phosphodiester (PO) aODNs was strongly length dependent with a half-maximal inhibition calculated for an oligo length of 7.6 nucleotides (nt) and 9.9 nt, respectively. More than 95% inhibition was mediated by a PS aODN of 12 nt and by PO aODNs > or = 15 nt. At a given length PS and PO aODNs showed differential dependence of their inhibitory effect on the injected aODN concentration (half-maximal inhibition at 18 ng/microliter for a PO 12-mer and at 0.19 ng/microliter for a PS 12-mer) and differential saturation behavior. The inhibitory effect of aODNs, even as short as 8 nt for PS oligomers, was highly sequence specific, but almost independent of the position of the respective target site on the cRNA (for PS 8-mers, > or = 70% expression inhibition throughout the tested target sites from the translation initiation to the 3'-untranslated region). Thus, short PS aODNs can be reliably used in order to specifically inhibit protein expression in experiments addressing physiological, molecular biological, and perhaps even therapeutical issues."
https://openalex.org/W1569857536,"As a first step toward understanding the topology of the signal peptide with respect to the membrane during the protein export process, we have examined the constraints on the length of the cleavage region needed to achieve signal peptidase recognition and cleavage. Using the signal peptide of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, a series of cleavage region mutants has been constructed. Variations in length were brought about by replacing the wild type cleavage region of the signal peptide with polymers of increasingly more residues. In each case, alanine residues are used exclusively in the -1 and -3 positions to provide only one viable cleavage site. Glutamine residues are used in all other positions in order to vary the length from 3 to 13 total residues. Analysis of these mutants revealed that cleavage regions ranging from 3 to 9 residues are completely and efficiently processed. The extent of processing drops substantially thereafter, with no processing observed for signal peptides with 13-residue long cleavage regions. A second mutant with a 13-residue long cleavage region was designed and analyzed to ensure that the lack of processing reflected a cleavage problem and not a translocation defect. The results are consistent with the notion that the signal peptidase active site is in close proximity to the periplasmic surface of the inner membrane and that interaction of the cleavage region with the signal peptidase probably depends on, and is constrained by, other interactions involving the signal peptide."

The solubilized GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase was assayed using radiolabeled GlcNAc-PI substrates. The enzyme was partially purified about 140-fold from washed trypanosome membranes using conventional liquid chromatography. The enzyme has a Km of 1.5 microM. Replacement of the di-O-substituted D-myo-inositol of the natural GlcNAc-PI substrate by the L-myo-inositol isomer did not significantly alter the ability of the compound to act as a substrate for the de-N-acetylase, suggesting that the C-2 to C-5 hydroxyl groups of the myoinositol ring do not play a critical role in substrate recognition. A substrate analogue lacking fatty acids was a relatively poor substrate for the enzyme, indicating that the lipid component plays an important role in substrate recognition and/or presentation of the substrate to the enzyme in detergent micelles. Substrate analogues lacking the glycerophosphate component were not recognized by the enzyme, suggesting that this component is important in the substrate recognition process."
https://openalex.org/W1590482720,"Recent cloning and sequencing studies suggest that heavy chains of all non-muscle myosins II have a protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site within their tail regions. A fragment of human macrophage myosin heavy chain, encompassing its COOH-terminal 396 amino acids (MIIAF46), was expressed in Escherichia coli to provide a model system for study of PKC-mediated phosphorylation. PKC phosphorylated this fragment when phosphatidylserine (PS) liposomes were present, but not when liposomes made from PS/phosphatidylcholine (PC) were used. The reaction required Ca2+, but not other activators such as diacylglycerol (DG) or phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Phosphorylation of MIIAF46 was not observed in the presence of micelles of PS or PS/DG. Similar results were obtained using native myosin II purified from bovine brain and chicken intestine brush border. Phosphorylation of light chains, in contrast, occurred even with PS/PC liposomes if DG was present. Addition of the PS and PS/DG liposomes significantly increased the turbidities at 340 nm of MIIAF46 and native myosin II, and the extent of increase depended upon the type of myosin used. Also, PS and PS/DG liposomes shifted the gel filtration elution positions of MIIAF46 and myosin II. In contrast, liposomes of PS/PC and PS/PC/DG gave only a slight increase in turbidity with all myosins and fragments and did not noticeably shift their gel filtration elution positions. These results suggest that myosins II bind to PS liposomes via the COOH-terminal regions of their heavy chains with affinities specific to each myosin isoform, that the binding is dependent upon the PS composition, and that PKC phosphorylates the PS-bound heavy chains."
https://openalex.org/W1570727454,"Abstract The pH regulation of Leishmania major promastigotes was studied as a function of the ionic composition of the medium and in response to acid and alkali load. Intracellular pH (pHi) was monitored by on-line ratio fluorescence using the fluorescence-dependent pH indicator 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). In Cl(-)-based medium (pH 7.4, 30 degrees C), the steady state pHi was maintained at 6.75 +/- 0.01. Only a minor ( or = 0.2 unit. In gluconate-based medium, however, pHi gradually decreased to 6.53 +/- 0.05 and showed a swift but time-dependent recovery (alkalinization) when Cl- or other halides or nitrate were restored to the medium. That recovery was also inhibited by pretreating cells with DIDS or exposing them to H2DIDS. The findings provide evidence for Cl- transport mechanisms that support a pHi regulatory process which is operative in acidic-neutral cytoplasmic milieu. Under alkali load induced by weak base treatment, parasites undergo a rapid alkalinization which was followed first by a fast but limited acidification and subsequently by a slower but more robust acidification (recovery) to reach a pHi of 6.85 +/- 0.05. The recovery of pHi was markedly reduced in the presence of H2DIDS and/or in the absence of Cl- in the medium. Based on these results and on the fact that the natural parasite environment is both alkaline and rich in HCO3-/CO3(2-) ions, we propose (Cl-)o-(HCO3-)i or (Cl-)o-(OH-)i exchange as the major mechanism of regulatory cell acidification which is operative upon cell alkalinization. The possibility that similar pH regulatory mechanisms are operative in Leishmania promastigotes in both acidic and alkaline conditions is considered. The putative pH regulatory mechanisms might serve as potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1548734185,"The synthesis of thymidylate synthase (TS) from 5-fluorouracil (FUra)- and 5-bromouracil (BrUra)-substituted mRNAs was examined to investigate the effect of incorporation of uracil (Ura) analogs on translation. Human TS cDNA was transcribed in the presence of Ura-, FUra-, or BrUTP to obtain 100% substituted mRNA. The mRNAs were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. The TS protein that was formed from each of the templates reacted identically with TS antibody in Western blots. Time courses of TS formation revealed a characteristic peak which occurred at 45 min for the Ura- and FUra-RNAs and at 2 h for the BrUra-RNA. Substitution of Ura with FUra did not alter the rate of translation, while substitution of BrU for Ura decreased the rate of translation. Substitution of Ura with FUra or BrUra enhanced the stability of the mRNAs in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate by 3- and 10-fold, respectively. Incorporation of BrUra influenced the binding and catalysis on the ribosome, resulting in a 3.5-fold greater rate of activation (Kact) and 6-fold lower Vmax than the equivalent values for the Ura- and FUra-substituted mRNAs. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis revealed that different conformations exist among the mRNAs. These data show that translation can be influenced by the incorporation of fraudulent bases into mRNA and those bases that stabilize RNA secondary structure will have the greatest inhibitory effect on translation."
https://openalex.org/W1558297299,"halobacterium salinarium (formerly H. halobium) is a chemotactic and phototactic archaeon from which volatile methyl groups are released continually, a phenomenon related to its sensory system. We found that released methyl groups comprised two different chemical species, methanol and methanethiol, the sulfur analog of methanol. Radiolabeling experiments showed that the methyl groups of both compounds, as well as the sulfur of methanethiol, were derived from methionine but were donated to cellular components and subsequently cleaved to produce the respective volatile compounds. Previous work had shown that chemostimuli and photostimuli result in transient increases in the rate of release of volatile methyl groups. We found that these increases reflected increased release of methanol but not of methanethiol. Thus, the methyl group chemistry of the H. salinarium sensory system is analogous to the well-studied chemotactic system of Escherichia coli. The reactions that result in methanethiol release are of unknown function and have unusual features. They may involve a methionine-gamma-lyase activity we detected in H. salinarium. Sulfur derived from methionine was found attached to specific proteins in reduction-sensitive disulfide linkages."
https://openalex.org/W1553162372,"We have constructed the double mutant G2252C/G2253C in Escherichia coli 23 S rRNA by site-directed mutagenesis. These phylogenetically conserved residues are protected from chemical modification by the 3' CCA terminus of the peptidyl-tRNA site (P site)-bound tRNA. Expression of C2252/C2253 23 S rRNA in E. coli severely compromises cell growth. Mutant rRNA is assembled into 50 S subunits and 70 S ribosomes but is discriminated against in polysomes. Mutant ribosomes function at lower rates in peptidyltransferase assays than wild type ribosomes. To test whether this defect derives from disruption of base pairing with the 2 cytidines of the invariant 3' CCA terminus of tRNA, a mutant E. coli tRNAPhe gene was constructed, with the CCA sequence changed to GGA. As deacylated species, mutant and wild type tRNAPhe inhibit peptidyl transfer identically. Mutant tRNAPhe was aminoacylated in vitro but failed to react as a P site substrate, with either mutant or wild type ribosomes. These results support a role for G2252 and G2253 of 23 S rRNA in peptidyltransferase function and a role for the 3' residues of peptidyl-tRNA in catalytically productive P site interaction; but they fail to provide evidence supporting canonical base pairing between these 23 S residues and the 3' end of peptidyl-tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1577862498,"The ATP-induced change in the tryptophan fluorescence of the Ca(2+)-ATPase was determined with sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles at pH 7.0 in the presence of Ca2+ under various conditions by steady-state measurements and stopped-flow spectrofluorometry. Formation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate was also determined by the continuous flow-rapid quenching method. The steady-state fluorescence at 0 degrees C decreased by 1.1% on addition of ATP, whereas no fluorescence change was induced by adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-methylene)triphosphate (a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog incapable of phosphorylating the enzyme). The time course of the ATP-induced fluorescence drop agreed well with that of the phosphoenzyme formation under all of the conditions tested, and the phosphoenzyme formed was largely sensitive to ADP. When phosphoenzyme isomerization from the ADP-sensitive form to the ADP-insensitive form was almost completely prevented by N-ethylmaleimide treatment, the time course of the ATP-induced fluorescence drop again agreed with that of the phosphoenzyme formation. These results show that the ATP-induced fluorescence drop occurs upon formation of the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme. The results further indicate that the tryptophan fluorescence of this enzyme is insensitive to the conformational change which was previously shown (Suzuki, H., Obara, M., Kuwayama, H., and Kanazawa, T. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15448-15456) to occur upon formation of the calcium-enzyme-substrate complex.

https://openalex.org/W1611838331,"Autophosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor on tyrosine, which is dependent upon and occurs immediately after ligand binding, has been linked to the activation of second messenger pathways thought to be necessary for the induction of gene expression, DNA synthesis, and mitogenesis. We have investigated PDGF signal transduction in Balb/c3T3 and NIH-3T3 cells at the level of immediate-early gene induction under three conditions in which PDGF receptor autophosphorylation in response to PDGF binding is blocked: cells transformed by v-rasKi, cells transformed by v-mos, and cells treated with genistein, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine kinases. PDGF induction of immediate-early genes c-myc, c-fos, and JE is blocked in these systems. Induction of another immediate-early gene, egr-1, occurs normally despite the absence of measurable tyrosine kinase activity. The same results were obtained when cells were stimulated with PDGF-AA or PDGF-BB. It is not yet clear if this receptor tyrosine kinase-independent signal utilizes known PDGF second messengers, but these results demonstrate a new arm of the PDGF signal transduction pathway which operates in the absence of, and independently from, autophosphorylation of the receptor on tyrosine."
https://openalex.org/W1518292773,"We have studied the cleavage of human high molecular weight kininogen (HK) by plasma kallikrein in the absence and presence of the surfaces, dextran sulfate (DxSO4) and sulfatides. Using a combination of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies that specifically recognize the COOH terminus of the bradykinin moiety, and high pressure liquid chromatography analyses of the cleavage reaction, we have identified two intermediates in the formation of bradykinin from intact kininogen and demonstrated that alternative cleavage pathways are followed in the absence and presence of surfaces. The COOH-terminal bradykinin cleavage occurred first both in the absence and presence of DxSO4, producing a 103-kDa HK intermediate consisting of disulfide-linked heavy and light chains that retained the kinin moiety. In the presence of DxSO4, this was followed exclusively by the NH2-terminal bradykinin cleavage and release of kinin with no apparent change in molecular mass. Subsequently, a slower cleavage of an 8-kDa peptide from the amino terminus of the HK light chain occurred to form a 95-kDa end product. In contrast to this sequential cleavage pattern, NH2-terminal bradykinin and light chain cleavages occurred randomly in the absence of DxSO4, resulting in the production of an additional 95-kDa intermediate that retained bradykinin but had lost the 8-kDa peptide from the HK light chain. Comparison of the relative rates of the three kallikrein cleavages in the absence and presence of DxSO4 indicated that the surface enhanced the rates of both bradykinin cleavages 2-4-fold, but inhibited the light chain cleavage rate approximately 10-fold, thereby accounting for the change from a partially random to a sequential cleavage pattern in the presence of the surface. Steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that DxSO4 enhanced the kcat/KM for bradykinin release by the rate-limiting NH2-terminal bradykinin cleavage by approximately 2-fold due exclusively to an increase in kcat. Sulfatides appeared to produce the same effects on the pattern of HK cleavages as DxSO4. Blocking of the nonactive site, i.e. exosite, interaction between kallikrein and HK with excess prekallikrein or a synthetic peptide containing the region of HK that interacts with the kallikrein exosite significantly reduced the rate of bradykinin release as well as HK cleavages detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis either in the absence or presence of DxSO4, indicating that the exosite interaction facilitates bradykinin cleavage."

Characteristic features of the spectra obtained at 9 and 10 GHz were analyzed and fit by simulation. One of the nitrogens possessed superhyperfine parameters (Aiso = 0.8 MHz, reff = 3.2 A, e2Qq = 1.8 MHz, eta = 0.35) consistent with a non-coordinating amino nitrogen of a histidine imidazole ligand to a Fe(III). The second, more strongly interacting nitrogen (Aiso = 5.0 MHz, reff = 2.2 A, e2Qq = 3.0 MHz, eta = 0.3) corresponds to the N delta directly bound to the effective Fe(II). These findings extend the previous electron nuclear double resonance results on the Methylosinus trichosporium hydroxylase (Hendrich, M.P., Fox, B.G., Andersson, K.K., Debrunner, P.G., and Lipscomb, J.D. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 261-269), which identified the N delta-Fe(II) interaction but failed to quantify its magnitude. Measurement of the linear electric field g shift of this mixed-valence species indicated that the site is charge-polarized on to one of the iron atoms, and its symmetry suggests that either charge is shifted away from the Fe-Fe axis (if gmax is defined by the Fe-Fe axis) or that gmid and gmax are perpendicular to the Fe-Fe axis (charge strongly localized at Fe(III) and axis taken as gmin)."

An anti-peptide antibody raised against the carboxyl-terminal 11 amino acids of mouse GPT, immunoadsorbed GPT activity and recognized a protein of expected size (approximately 48 kDa) on Western blots. Mouse mammary glands at different stages of development were examined for GPT activity, immunoreactive protein, and GPT mRNA. All three parameters showed a similar trend, i.e. they were low in tissues from virgin and pregnant animals, increased steadily during lactation, reaching a peak around mid to late lactation, and declined thereafter in glands from post-lactating animals. At mid-lactation, the increase in GPT activity, immunoreactive protein, and GPT mRNA relative to the virgin stage was 9.5-, 3.3- and 5.4-fold respectively, on a per cell basis. These data suggest possible transcriptional and post-transcriptional modulation of GPT gene expression during development of mouse mammary gland. The results on hormonal regulation of GPT in mouse mammary explants and primary mouse mammary epithelial cells showed that all three parameters cited above were stimulated maximally by the combined presence of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin, indicating that the hormonal regulation of GPT expression is also mediated at the level of RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1497462309,"Abstract The ABF1 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a multifunctional DNA-binding protein that is required for cell viability. The ABF1 protein has previously been shown to bind to a number of yeast sequences having a consensus of: 5'-A/G TC A/G C/T C/T NNNNACG-3'. A heretofore undiscovered ABF1-binding site was found in the MATa region. We have used missing contact analysis of this ABF1-binding site to show that removal of the conserved bases, as well as of some bases which are not conserved, reduces binding. We have probed contacts of ABF1 with the DNA-binding site using dimethyl sulfate and potassium permanganate and find that the protein makes extensive contacts with both the major and minor grooves. Ethylation interference studies indicate that numerous phosphate contacts are also important for ABF1 binding. Interference studies indicate that the ABF1 protein is also in close proximity to the DNA that is 5' and 3' of the conserved bases of the binding site. The extensive DNA contacts exhibited by ABF1 may play a role in the protein-induced bending of the DNA target (McBroom, L. D. B., and Sadowski, P. D. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 169, 16461-16468)."
https://openalex.org/W1581286651,"Signals controlling the insulin receptor endocytotic pathway have been investigated using the R1152Q insulin receptor mutant (M). This mutant receptor exhibits high levels of insulin-independent kinase activity, impaired autophosphorylation, and lack of an insulin stimulatory effect on both auto- and substrate phosphorylation. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts expressing M receptors displayed a 2.5-fold higher 125I-insulin internalization rate than wild type (WT) but lacked insulin-induced receptor internalization and down-regulation. Cell surface recycling of internalized receptors also occurred at a higher rate in M cells and was unaffected by insulin. Cell preincubation with 35 mM Tris, which inhibits the insulin receptor degradative route, elicited no effect on M receptor recycling but inhibited that of WT by 40%. In contrast, the energy depleter 2,4-dinitrophenol, which inhibits normal insulin receptor retroendocytosis, impaired M receptor recycling 4-fold more effectively than that of WT. The release of internalized intact 125I-insulin was 6-fold greater in M than in WT fibroblasts and was almost completely inhibited by dinitrophenol, whereas insulin degradation by M cells was 4-fold decreased as compared with WT. Thus, internalization and recycling of the constitutively active Gln1152 receptor kinase occur in the absence of autophosphorylation. However, tyrosine phosphorylation appears to be required for proper sorting of endocytosed insulin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1541467162,"Type III collagen, a ubiquitous protein found in most connective tissues, is not present in hyaline cartilage. However, we have identified an alternative transcript of the type III collagen gene in cultured chondrocytes from several embryonic chick cartilages. This RNA contains exons 24-52, but exons 1-23 are replaced by 70 nucleotides of unique sequence, suggesting that transcription initiates at an alternative promoter. Two of the open reading frames in the alternative transcript are out of frame with the collagen coding sequence; a third open reading frame encodes the carboxyl-terminal two-thirds of the collagen sequence. Thus, this RNA cannot serve as a template for synthesis of normal type III collagen and may encode noncollagenous proteins and/or a truncated collagen. The alternative transcript has been detected as early as 2.5 days of embryogenesis and at later stages is present at low levels in many tissues, including limb mesenchyme and cartilage. These results, together with our previous identification of an alternative transcript of the chick alpha 2(I) collagen gene (Bennett, V. D., and Adams, S. L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2223-2230), suggest that some collagen genes may have alternative functions that are independent of their roles in collagen production."
