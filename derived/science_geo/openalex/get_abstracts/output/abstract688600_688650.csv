https://openalex.org/W4211105116,"Many monogenic disorders cause a characteristic facial morphology. Artificial intelligence can support physicians in recognizing these patterns by associating facial phenotypes with the underlying syndrome through training on thousands of patient photographs. However, this 'supervised' approach means that diagnoses are only possible if the disorder was part of the training set. To improve recognition of ultra-rare disorders, we developed GestaltMatcher, an encoder for portraits that is based on a deep convolutional neural network. Photographs of 17,560 patients with 1,115 rare disorders were used to define a Clinical Face Phenotype Space, in which distances between cases define syndromic similarity. Here we show that patients can be matched to others with the same molecular diagnosis even when the disorder was not included in the training set. Together with mutation data, GestaltMatcher could not only accelerate the clinical diagnosis of patients with ultra-rare disorders and facial dysmorphism but also enable the delineation of new phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W4211257609,"Recruiting endogenous adenosine deaminases using exogenous guide RNAs to edit cellular RNAs is a promising therapeutic strategy, but editing efficiency and durability remain low using current guide RNA designs. In this study, we engineered circular ADAR-recruiting guide RNAs (cadRNAs) to enable more efficient programmable adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing without requiring co-delivery of any exogenous proteins. Using these cadRNAs, we observed robust and durable RNA editing across multiple sites and cell lines, in both untranslated and coding regions of RNAs, and high transcriptome-wide specificity. Additionally, we increased transcript-level specificity for the target adenosine by incorporating interspersed loops in the antisense domains, reducing bystander editing. In vivo delivery of cadRNAs via adeno-associated viruses enabled 53% RNA editing of the mPCSK9 transcript in C57BL/6J mice livers and 12% UAG-to-UGG RNA correction of the amber nonsense mutation in the IDUA-W392X mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler syndrome. cadRNAs enable efficient programmable RNA editing in vivo with diverse protein modulation and gene therapeutic applications. Circular guide RNAs boost the efficiency of RNA editing with endogenous ADARs."

https://openalex.org/W4211164289,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is an inherited neurological disorder caused by deficiency of hexosaminidase A (HexA). Here, we describe an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy expanded-access trial in two patients with infantile TSD (IND 18225) with safety as the primary endpoint and no secondary endpoints. Patient TSD-001 was treated at 30 months with an equimolar mix of AAVrh8-HEXA and AAVrh8-HEXB administered intrathecally (i.t.), with 75% of the total dose (1 × 1014 vector genomes (vg)) in the cisterna magna and 25% at the thoracolumbar junction. Patient TSD-002 was treated at 7 months by combined bilateral thalamic (1.5 × 1012 vg per thalamus) and i.t. infusion (3.9 × 1013 vg). Both patients were immunosuppressed. Injection procedures were well tolerated, with no vector-related adverse events (AEs) to date. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HexA activity increased from baseline and remained stable in both patients. TSD-002 showed disease stabilization by 3 months after injection with ongoing myelination, a temporary deviation from the natural history of infantile TSD, but disease progression was evident at 6 months after treatment. TSD-001 remains seizure-free at 5 years of age on the same anticonvulsant therapy as before therapy. TSD-002 developed anticonvulsant-responsive seizures at 2 years of age. This study provides early safety and proof-of-concept data in humans for treatment of patients with TSD by AAV gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4225878721,"Facial emotion recognition is crucial for social interaction. However, in times of a global pandemic, where wearing a face mask covering mouth and nose is widely encouraged to prevent the spread of disease, successful emotion recognition may be challenging. In the current study, we investigated whether emotion recognition, assessed by a validated emotion recognition task, is impaired for faces wearing a mask compared to uncovered faces, in a sample of 790 participants between 18 and 89 years (condition mask vs . original ). In two more samples of 395 and 388 participants between 18 and 70 years, we assessed emotion recognition performance for faces that are occluded by something other than a mask, i.e., a bubble as well as only showing the upper part of the faces (condition half vs . bubble ). Additionally, perception of threat for faces with and without occlusion was assessed. We found impaired emotion recognition for faces wearing a mask compared to faces without mask, for all emotions tested (anger, fear, happiness, sadness, disgust, neutral). Further, we observed that perception of threat was altered for faces wearing a mask. Upon comparison of the different types of occlusion, we found that, for most emotions and especially for disgust, there seems to be an effect that can be ascribed to the face mask specifically, both for emotion recognition performance and perception of threat. Methodological constraints as well as the importance of wearing a mask despite temporarily compromised social interaction are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4211192717,"CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is critical to three-dimensional genome organization. Upon differentiation, CTCF insulates active and repressed genes within Hox gene clusters. We conducted a genome-wide CRISPR knockout (KO) screen to identify genes required for CTCF-boundary activity at the HoxA cluster, complemented by biochemical approaches. Among the candidates, we identified Myc-associated zinc-finger protein (MAZ) as a cofactor in CTCF insulation. MAZ colocalizes with CTCF at chromatin borders and, similar to CTCF, interacts with the cohesin subunit RAD21. MAZ KO disrupts gene expression and local contacts within topologically associating domains. Similar to CTCF motif deletions, MAZ motif deletions lead to derepression of posterior Hox genes immediately after CTCF boundaries upon differentiation, giving rise to homeotic transformations in mouse. Thus, MAZ is a factor contributing to appropriate insulation, gene expression and genomic architecture during development."
https://openalex.org/W4225259281,"Abstract The mRNA-1273 vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) demonstrated 93.2% efficacy in reduction of symptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections in the blinded portion of the Phase 3 Coronavirus Efficacy (COVE) trial. While mRNA-1273 demonstrated high efficacy in prevention of COVID-19, including severe disease, its effect on the viral dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infections is not understood. Here, in exploratory analyses, we assessed the impact of mRNA-1273 vaccination in the ongoing COVE trial (number NCT04470427) on SARS-CoV-2 copy number and shedding, burden of disease and infection, and viral variants. Viral variants were sequenced in all COVID-19 and adjudicated COVID-19 cases ( n = 832), from July 2020 in the blinded part A of the study to May 2021 of the open-label part B of the study, in which participants in the placebo arm started to receive the mRNA-1273 vaccine after US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization of mRNA-1273 in December 2020. mRNA-1273 vaccination significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral copy number (95% confidence interval) by 100-fold on the day of diagnosis compared with placebo (4.1 (3.4–4.8) versus 6.2 (6.0–6.4) log 10 copies per ml). Median times to undetectable viral copies were 4 days for mRNA-1273 and 7 days for placebo. Vaccination also substantially reduced the burden of disease and infection scores. Vaccine efficacies (95% confidence interval) against SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in the United States during the trial assessed in this post hoc analysis were 82.4% (40.4–94.8%) for variants Epsilon and Gamma and 81.2% (36.1–94.5%) for Epsilon. The detection of other, non-SARS-CoV-2, respiratory viruses during the trial was similar between groups. While additional study is needed, these data show that in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, vaccination reduced both the viral copy number and duration of detectable viral RNA, which may be markers for the risk of virus transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4211101290,"Misophonia is a newly described condition characterized by sensory and emotional reactivity (e.g., anxiety, anger, disgust) to repetitive, pattern-based sounds (e.g., throat clearing, chewing, slurping). Individuals with misophonia report significant functional impairment and interpersonal distress. Growing research indicates ineffective coping and emotional functioning broadly (e.g., affective lability, difficulties with emotion regulation) are central to the clinical presentation and severity of misophonia. Preliminary evidence suggests an association between negative emotionality and deficits in emotion regulation in misophonia. Still, little is known about (a) the relationships among specific components of emotional functioning (e.g., emotion regulation, affective lability) with misophonia, and (b) which component(s) of misophonia (e.g., noise frequency, emotional and behavioral responses, impairment) are associated with emotional functioning. Further, despite evidence that mood and anxiety disorders co-occur with misophonia, investigation thus far has not controlled for depression and anxiety symptoms. Examination of these relationships will help inform treatment development for misophonia. The present study begins to disambiguate the relationships among affective lability, difficulties with emotion regulation, and components of misophonia. A sample of 297 participants completed questionnaires assessing misophonia, emotional functioning, depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 impact. Findings indicated that misophonia severity was positively associated with each of these constructs with small to medium effect sizes. When controlling for depression, anxiety, and COVID-19 impact, results from this preliminary study suggest that (a) difficulties with emotion regulation may be correlated with misophonia severity, and (b) misophonic responses, not number of triggers or perceived severity, are associated with difficulties with emotion regulation. Overall, these findings begin to suggest that emotion regulation is important to our understanding the risk factors and treatment targets for misophonia."

https://openalex.org/W4211117603,"Microbial communities inhabit spatial architectures that divide a global environment into isolated or semi-isolated local environments, which leads to the partitioning of a microbial community into a collection of local communities. Despite its ubiquity and great interest in related processes, how and to what extent spatial partitioning affects the structures and dynamics of microbial communities are poorly understood. Using modeling and quantitative experiments with simple and complex microbial communities, we demonstrate that spatial partitioning modulates the community dynamics by altering the local interaction types and global interaction strength. Partitioning promotes the persistence of populations with negative interactions but suppresses those with positive interactions. For a community consisting of populations with both positive and negative interactions, an intermediate level of partitioning maximizes the overall diversity of the community. Our results reveal a general mechanism underlying the maintenance of microbial diversity and have implications for natural and engineered communities."
https://openalex.org/W4226047574,"The infinite sites model of molecular evolution posits that every position in the genome is mutated at most once1. By restricting the number of possible mutation histories, haplotypes and alleles, it forms a cornerstone of tumor phylogenetic analysis2 and is often implied when calling, phasing and interpreting variants3,4 or studying the mutational landscape as a whole5. Here we identify 18,295 biallelic mutations, where the same base is mutated independently on both parental copies, in 559 (21%) bulk sequencing samples from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes study. Biallelic mutations reveal ultraviolet light damage hotspots at E26 transformation-specific (ETS) and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding sites, and hypermutable motifs in POLE-mutant and other cancers. We formulate recommendations for variant calling and provide frameworks to model and detect biallelic mutations. These results highlight the need for accurate models of mutation rates and tumor evolution, as well as their inference from sequencing data."
https://openalex.org/W4211190904,"The test-trace-isolate-quarantine (TTIQ) strategy, where confirmed-positive pathogen carriers are isolated from the community and their recent close contacts are identified and pre-emptively quarantined, is used to break chains of transmission during a disease outbreak. The protocol is frequently followed after an individual presents with disease symptoms, at which point they will be tested for the pathogen. This TTIQ strategy, along with hygiene and social distancing measures, make up the non-pharmaceutical interventions that are utilised to suppress the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here we develop a tractable mathematical model of disease transmission and the TTIQ intervention to quantify how the probability of detecting and isolating a case following symptom onset, the fraction of contacts that are identified and quarantined, and the delays inherent to these processes impact epidemic growth. In the model, the timing of disease transmission and symptom onset, as well as the frequency of asymptomatic cases, is based on empirical distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics, while the isolation of confirmed cases and quarantine of their contacts is implemented by truncating their respective infectious periods. We find that a successful TTIQ strategy requires intensive testing: the majority of transmission is prevented by isolating symptomatic individuals and doing so in a short amount of time. Despite the lesser impact, additional contact tracing and quarantine increases the parameter space in which an epidemic is controllable and is necessary to control epidemics with a high reproductive number. TTIQ could remain an important intervention for the foreseeable future of the COVID-19 pandemic due to slow vaccine rollout and highly-transmissible variants with the potential for vaccine escape. Our results can be used to assess how TTIQ can be improved and optimised, and the methodology represents an improvement over previous quantification methods that is applicable to future epidemic scenarios."
https://openalex.org/W4225497420,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and is, therefore, treated with systemic drugs, such as tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs). These drugs, however, offer only modest survival benefits due to the rapid development of drug resistance. To identify genes implicated in TKI resistance, a cluster of regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 activation screen was performed in hepatoma cells treated with regorafenib, a TKI used as second-line therapy for advanced HCC. The screen results show that Hexokinase 1 (HK1), catalyzing the first step in glucose metabolism, is a top candidate for conferring TKI resistance. Compatible with this, HK1 was upregulated in regorafenib-resistant cells. Using several experimental approaches, both in vitro and in vivo, we show that TKI resistance correlates with HK1 expression. Furthermore, an HK inhibitor resensitized resistant cells to TKI treatment. Together, our data indicate that HK1 may function as a critical factor modulating TKI resistance in hepatoma cells and, therefore, may serve as a biomarker for treatment success."
https://openalex.org/W4210992203,"Analyzing different tumor regions by next generation sequencing allows the assessment of intratumor genetic heterogeneity (ITGH), a phenomenon that has been studied widely in some tumor types but has been less well explored in endometrial carcinoma (EC). In this study, we sought to characterize the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of 9 different ECs using whole-exome sequencing, and by performing targeted sequencing validation of the 42 primary tumor regions and 30 metastatic samples analyzed. In addition, copy number alterations of serous carcinomas were assessed by comparative genomic hybridization arrays. From the somatic mutations, identified by whole-exome sequencing, 532 were validated by targeted sequencing. Based on these data, the phylogenetic tree reconstructed for each case allowed us to establish the tumors' evolution and correlate this to tumor progression, prognosis, and the presence of recurrent disease. Moreover, we studied the genetic landscape of an ambiguous EC and the molecular profile obtained was used to guide the selection of a potential personalized therapy for this patient, which was subsequently validated by preclinical testing in patient-derived xenograft models. Overall, our study reveals the impact of analyzing different tumor regions to decipher the ITGH in ECs, which could help make the best treatment decision."
https://openalex.org/W4211020517,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammatory bone destruction in which tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) plays a key role. Bovine lactoferrin (bLF) is a multifunctional protein with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This study aimed to clarify the inhibitory effects of bLF on the pathological progression of RA. The mannan-induced arthritis model in SKG mice (genetic RA model) was used. Orally applied liposomal bLF (LbLF) markedly reduced ankle joint swelling and bone destruction. Histologically, pannus formation and osteoclastic bone destruction were prevented in the LbLF-treated animals. Moreover, orally administered LbLF improved the balance between Th17 cells and regulatory T cells isolated from the spleen of mannan-treated SKG mice. In an in vitro study, the anti-inflammatory effects of bLF on TNF-α-induced TNF-α production and downstream signaling pathways were analyzed in human synovial fibroblasts from RA patients (RASFs). bLF suppressed TNF-α production from RASFs by inhibiting the nuclear factor kappa B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. The intracellular accumulation of bLF in RASFs increased in an applied bLF dose-dependent manner. Knockdown of the lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1) siRNA gene reduced bLF expression in RASFs, indicating that exogenously applied bLF was mainly internalized through LRP-1. Immunoprecipitated proteins with anti-TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2; an adapter protein/ubiquitin ligase) included bLF, indicating that bLF binds directly to the TRAF2-TRADD-RIP complex. This indicates that LbLF may effectively prevent the pathological progression of RA by suppressing TNF-α production by binding to the TRAF2-TRADD-RIP complex from the RASFs in the pannus. Therefore, supplemental administration of LbLF may have a beneficial effect on preventive/therapeutic reagents for RA."
https://openalex.org/W4211151870,"Abstract Cancer treatments have been revolutionized by the emergence of immune checkpoint blockade therapies. However, only a minority of patients with various tumor types have benefited from such treatments. New strategies focusing on the immune contexture of the tumor tissue microenvironment hold great promises. Here, we created IFNα-overexpressing mesenchymal stromal cells (IFNα-MSCs). Upon direct injection into tumors, we found that these cells are powerful in eliminating several types of tumors. Interestingly, the intra-tumoral injection of IFNα-MSCs could also induce specific anti-tumor effects on distant tumors. These IFNα-MSCs promoted tumor cells to produce CXCL10, which in turn potentiates the infiltration of CD8 + T cells in the tumor site. Furthermore, IFNα-MSCs enhanced the expression of granzyme B (GZMB) in CD8 + T cells and invigorated their cytotoxicity in a Stat3-dependent manner. Genetic ablation of Stat3 in CD8 + T cells impaired the effect of IFNα-MSCs on GZMB expression. Importantly, the combination of IFNα-MSCs and PD-L1 blockade induced an even stronger anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, IFNα-MSCs represent a novel tumor immunotherapy strategy, especially when combined with PD-L1 blockade."
https://openalex.org/W4211199073,"Background Widespread vaccination coverage is essential for reducing the COVID-19 havoc and regarded as a crucial tool in restoring normal life on university campuses. Therefore, our research aimed to understand the intention to be vaccinated for COVID-19 among Pakistani university students. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in five administrative units of Pakistan, i.e., Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. We obtained data from 2,865 university students between 17 th January and 2 nd February, 2021, using a semi-structured and self-administered questionnaire. We used Stata (version 16.1, StataCorp LLC) for data management and analysis. Results The majority (72.5%) of our respondents were willing to take COVID-19 vaccine. The current level of education had a statistically significant relationship with the intention to be vaccinated ( p &lt; 0.05). Respondents answered 11 questions encompassing five different domains of the Health Belief Model (HBM). All the items of HBM were significantly associated with the positive intention towards receiving the vaccine ( p &lt; 0.05). We conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess the relative contribution of different factors towards the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. Multiple factors such as belief that vaccination should be mandatory for everyone (AOR: 3.99, 95% CI: 3.20–4.98) and willingness to take vaccine even if it is not free (AOR: 3.91, 95% CI: 3.18–4.81) were observed to be associated with high odds of showing willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Conclusion Most of our study participants intended to take vaccines based on their belief regarding the high effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine. But as rumor-mongers are generating and spreading conspiracy theories daily, the health department and policymakers need to undertake evidence-based campaigns through electronic and social media to ensure expected countrywide vaccination coverage. In this case, our study findings can serve as a foundation for them to ensure mass vaccination coverage among university students, which is crucial now to reopen the dormitories and restore everyday life on campuses."
https://openalex.org/W4211075416,"North African coastal Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites are key to study the development and expansion of early H. sapiens. El Mnasra cave on the Atlantic coast of Morocco (Témara region) is a crucial site associated with MSA archaeological materials considered advanced cognitive hallmarks of behavioural innovation, such as numerous Nassariidae perforated shells, hematite pigments, bones industry and coastal resources exploitation. We provide new trapped-charges dates (OSL and combined US-ESR ages). Our Bayesian modelling strengthens the new lithostratigraphic interpretation of the cave stratigraphic units (US) and we propose an updated chronostratigraphic model for the Middle Stone Age archaeo-sequence of El Mnasra Cave. We confirm a human presence between 124-104 ka, earlier than what the previous OSL and US-ESR data showed. Our time range intervals allowed us to also extend the age of the MSA occupations considerably to the MIS 4/3 (~62-30 ka), marked by the disappearance of the Nassariidae perforated shells. Outstandingly, our model pushed back the age of the largest record of Nassariidae perforated shells and placed the age of their use by the Aterian groups at El Mnasra from the MIS 5d-5b (~115-94 ka)."
https://openalex.org/W4211127450,"Cyclin - dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) is an important protein kinase that regulates cell growth, development, cell metabolism, inflammation, and apoptosis. Its overexpression is associated with reprogramming glucose metabolism through alternative pathways and apoptosis, which ultimately plays a significant role in cancer development. In the present study, we have investigated the structural and conformational changes in CDK6 at varying pH employing a multi-spectroscopic approach. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy revealed at extremely acidic conditions (pH 2.0–4.0), the secondary structure of CDK6 got significantly disrupted, leading to aggregates formation. These aggregates were further characterized by employing Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence. No significant secondary structural changes were observed over the alkaline pH range (pH 7.0–11.0). Further, fluorescence and UV spectroscopy revealed that the tertiary structure of CDK6 was disrupted under extremely acidic conditions, with slight alteration occurring in mild acidic conditions. The tertiary structure remains intact over the entire alkaline range. Additionally, enzyme assay provided an insight into the functional aspect of CDK at varying pH; CDK6 activity was optimal in the pH range of 7.0–8.0. This study will provide a platform that provides newer insights into the pH-dependent dynamics and functional behavior of CDK6 in different CDK6 directed diseased conditions, viz. different types of cancers where changes in pH contribute to cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W4210960189,"Objectives Implementing whole-genome sequencing (WGS) technologies in clinical microbiology laboratories can increase the amount and quality of information available for healthcare practitioners. In this study, we analysed the applicability of this method and determined the distribution of bacterial species processed in clinical settings in Denmark. Methods We performed a point-prevalence study of all bacterial isolates (n = 2,009) processed and reported in the Clinical Microbiology Laboratories in Denmark in one day in January 2018. We compared species identification as performed by classical methods (MALDI-TOF) and by bioinformatics analysis (KmerFinder and rMLST) of WGS (Illumina NextSeq) data. We compared the national point-prevalence of bacterial isolates observed in clinical settings with the research attention given to those same genera in scientific literature. Results The most prevalent bacterium was Escherichia coli isolated from urine (n = 646), followed by Staphylococcus spp. from skin or soft tissues (n = 197). The distribution of bacterial species throughout the country was not homogeneous. We observed concordance of species identification for all methods in 95.7% (n = 1,919) of isolates, furthermore obtaining concordance for 99.7% (n = 1,999) at genus level. The number of scientific publications in the country did not correlate with the number of bacterial isolates of each genera analysed in this study. Conclusions WGS technologies have the potential to be applied in clinical settings for routine diagnostics purposes. This study also showed that bioinformatics databases should be continuously improved and results from local point-prevalence surveys should not be applied at national levels without previously determining possible regional variations."
https://openalex.org/W4210981971,"The tractor power-shift transmission (PST) research and development is a design process that incorporates many disciplines such as mechanical, control, and electronics. Modeling and simulation are typically dependent on various commercial tools for each discipline, making simulation, integration, and verification of system-level models problematic. Aiming at this, we propose a PST multi-domain co-simulation method based on the functional mock-up interface (FMI) standard, analyze the FMI-based simulation mechanism and the PST simulation system logical structure, and established the PST mechanical system model, control system model, tractor engine model, and tractor dynamic model. Based on FMI, these models are integrated into a PST co-simulation model. The starting speed, final drive half shaft speed and torque were simulated and tested. Among them, the simulation and the test starting time are 2.7s and 2.8s respectively, and the two speed curves are consistent; the simulation and the test final drive half shaft torque are approximately equal with a value of 1.5kN·m; the average Theil's inequality coefficients (TIC) value of the simulation and the test final drive half shaft speed is 0.1375, which is less than 0.25. The results show that the simulation and the test results are consistent, the PST co-simulation model is accurate, and the co-simulation method is feasible, which can improve the efficiency of tractor PST system development."
https://openalex.org/W4211092836,"Tests for recent HIV infection (TRI) distinguish recent from long-term HIV infections using markers of antibody maturation. The limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (LAg EIA) is widely used with HIV viral load (VL) in a recent infection testing algorithm (RITA) to improve classification of recent infection status, estimate population-level HIV incidence, and monitor trends in HIV transmission. A novel rapid test for recent HIV infection (RTRI), Asanté™, can determine HIV serostatus and HIV recency within minutes on a lateral flow device through visual assessment of test strip or reader device. We conducted a field-based laboratory evaluation of the RTRI among pregnant adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) attending antenatal clinics (ANC) in Malawi.We enrolled pregnant AGYW aged <25 years testing HIV-positive for the first time at their first ANC visit from 121 ANCs in four high-HIV burden districts. Consenting participants provided blood for recency testing using LAg EIA and RTRI, which were tested in central laboratories. Specimens with LAg EIA normalized optical density values ≤2.0 were classified as probable recent infections. RTRI results were based on: (1) visual assessment: presence of a long-term line (LT) indicating non-recent infection and absence of the line indicating recent infection; or (2) a reader; specimens with LT line intensity units <3.0 were classified as probable recent infections. VL was measured for specimens classified as a probable recent infections by either assay; those with HIV-1 RNA ≥1,000 copies/mL were classified as confirmed recent infections. We evaluated the performance of the RTRI by calculating correlation between RTRI and LAg EIA results, and percent agreement and kappa between RTRI and LAg EIA RITA results.Between November 2017 to June 2018, 380 specimens were available for RTRI evaluation; 376 (98.9%) were confirmed HIV-positive on RTRI. Spearman's rho between RTRI and LAg EIA was 0.72 indicating strong correlation. Percent agreement and kappa between RTRI- and LAg EIA-based RITAs were >90% and >0.65 respectively indicating substantial agreement between the RITAs.This was the first field evaluation of an RTRI in sub-Saharan Africa, which demonstrated good performance of the assay and feasibility of integrating RTRI into routine HIV testing services for real-time surveillance of recent HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W4211186891,"Vaccine hesitancy is increasing. We assessed attitudes toward influenza and COVID-19 vaccines and the relation between hesitancy to influenza vaccine and hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccines.A structured questionnaire administered during September 2020 to a representative sample of the Jewish Israeli population assessed attitudes and acceptance of influenza and COVID-19 vaccines. Factors for vaccine hesitancy were determined using logistic regression. Questionnaires were administered prior to the release of clinical data regarding efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccines and prior to vaccine rollout.We approached 10,625 people, of these 2,080 responded (19%), and 2,024 completed the questionnaire (97.3%), 64.9% aged 15-64 years and 35.1% aged ≥65 years. 37% had co-morbidities. 43.5% experienced financial deterioration due to the pandemic. 65.9% received influenza vaccine ≥1 time in the past. Influenza vaccination rates were higher in the elderly (81.8%). Reasons for influenza vaccine hesitancy were opinions that the vaccine is ineffective (27.1%), and fear of side effects (29.3%). 8.2% of people aged 16-64 and 13.8% of people aged≥65 refused to be vaccinated at least once over the course of one's lifetime. Percent of responders willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine were higher than percent of responders willing to receive the influenza vaccine both in people aged 16-64 years (942 (72.3%) vs. 38.4%, respectively) and in people 65 years and older (84.0% vs. 76.8%, respectively). Hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccine was associated with hesitancy towards other vaccines. Only 26.8% would participate in a COVID-19 vaccine trial.Willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccine was higher than willingness to receive influenza vaccine. The results point to areas of fear from influenza vaccines side effects and lack of knowledge regarding influenza vaccines effectiveness that can be addressed to increase acceptance. Hesitancy towards other vaccines was associated with hesitancy towards COVID-19 vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4211207358,"Purpose Results from large scale cardiovascular outcome trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) have found that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure, but the mechanisms behind the beneficial cardiovascular effects are not fully understood. We tested the hypothesis that the SGLT2i, empagliflozin, improves non-endothelial dependent coronary microvascular function, thereby leading to better cardiac function. Methods Patients with DM2 followed at the endocrinology outpatient clinic at Bispebjerg University Hospital were included in a double blinded, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Participants were allocated equally to each treatment sequence using simple randomization and treated with empagliflozin 25 mg and placebo for 12 weeks, interrupted by 2 weeks wash-out period. The primary outcome was coronary microvascular function, assessed as coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) and measured with transthoracic doppler echocardiography. Echocardiographic parameters of cardiac function were measured, and blood samples were analyzed for a broad panel of cardiovascular biomarkers. Results Thirteen patients were randomized to each sequence and 10 and 9 completed the study according to protocol, respectively, and were included in the analysis of outcome parameters. We found no improvement in CFVR (change in the empagliflozin period was -0.16 (SD 0.58)). There were no effects on cardiac systolic function or indicators of cardiac filling pressure. Well-known effects of empagliflozin were obtained, such as weight loss and reduction in Hba1c level. Creatinine level increased but remained within normal range. We observed a clear trend of reduction in cardiovascular biomarkers after empagliflozin treatment and increased levels after the placebo period. No serious adverse reactions were reported. Conclusions Despite effect on weight-loss, Hba1c and biomarkers, treatment with empagliflozin for 12 weeks did not improve CFVR in patients with DM2."

Here, we studied serpinA3c/k expression and secretion under different stressful conditions in vitro and in vivo. HEK-293 cells were transfected with a FLAG-tagged serpinA3c/k clone and exposed to H2 O2 or starvation. Both stressors induced serpinA3c/k secretion but with a higher molecular weight. Glycanase treatment established that serpinA3c/k is glycosylated. Site-directed mutagenesis for each of the four glycosylation sites was performed. During cellular stress, serpinA3c/k secretion increased with each mutant except in the quadruple mutant. In rats and patients suffering acute kidney injury (AKI), an atypical urinary serpinA3c/k excretion (uSerpinA3c/k) was observed. In rats with AKI, the greater the induced kidney damage, the greater the uSerpinA3 c/k, together with relocation toward ATM. Our findings show that: (1) serpinA3c/k is glycosylated and secreted, (2) serpinA3c/k secretion increases during cellular stress, (3) its appearance in urine reveals a pathophysiological state, and (4) urinary serpinA3 excretion could become a potential biomarker for AKI."
https://openalex.org/W4226147369,"N6-methyladenosine is considered to be the most common and abundant internal chemical modification among the more than 150 identified chemical RNA modifications. It is involved in most biological processes and actively participates in the regulation of animal reproduction. However, the potential function of m6 A in the pituitaries of mammals is not yet clear. It is also unknown whether m6 A is involved in the secretion and regulation of FSH by GnRH, which in turn affects mammalian reproduction. In this study, rats were treated with gonadorelin to simulate physiological GnRH-mediated regulation of FSH synthesis and secretion, and m6 A-seq was used to analyze the differential m6 A modification of the rat pituitary after gonadorelin treatment. A whole-transcriptome map of m6 A in the rat pituitary gland before and after gonadorelin treatment was successfully created. A total of 6413 differential peaks were identified, of which 3764 m6 A peaks were upregulated and 2649 m6 A peaks were downregulated. Among the 709 differentially expressed genes, 250 genes were discovered with differential methylation modifications. Intriguingly, the altered m6 A peaks within mRNAs were enriched in steroid biosynthetic processes and responses to cAMP. The results of the study will lay a foundation for further exploration of the potential role of m6 A modification in the regulation of reproductive hormone secretion and provide a theoretical basis for the application of GnRH analogs in mammalian artificial reproduction."
https://openalex.org/W4211032097,"The effects of social networks on the relationship between internationalization and firm performance have been well documented in the international literature, and two dimensions of social networks have also been identified: business ties and political ties. However, few efforts have been made to examine whether there are different mechanisms of business ties and political ties. Based on social network theory and boundary spanning theory, we build a model of a dual mechanism of social networks, and the business ties and political ties of social networks that correspond with information processing and the external representation of boundary spanning theory. Using the data of Chinese listed companies in 2005–2013 and 2013–2017 to test the model, the results indicate that (1) in the relationship between internationalization and firm performance, the role of social networks has a dual mechanism. (2) Business ties play a mediating role in the relationship between internationalization and firm performance. Business ties are conducive to a company’s information acquisition and knowledge sharing and play the role of information processing. (3) Political ties play a U-shaped moderating role in the relationship between internationalization and firm performance and assume the role of external representation."
https://openalex.org/W4211073642,"Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling regulates several polarization events during development of ommatidia in the Drosophila eye, including directing chirality by polarizing a cell fate choice and determining the direction and extent of ommatidial rotation. The pk sple isoform of the PCP protein Prickle is known to participate in the R3/R4 cell fate decision, but the control of other polarization events and the potential contributions of the three Pk isoforms have not been clarified. Here, by characterizing expression and subcellular localization of individual isoforms together with re-analyzing isoform specific phenotypes, we show that the R3/R4 fate decision, its coordination with rotation direction, and completion of rotation to a final ±90° rotation angle are separable polarization decisions with distinct Pk isoform requirements and contributions. Both pk sple and pk pk can enforce robust R3/R4 fate decisions, but only pk sple can correctly orient them along the dorsal-ventral axis. In contrast, pk sple and pk pk can fully and interchangeably sustain coordination of rotation direction and rotation to completion. We propose that expression dynamics and competitive interactions determine isoform participation in these processes. We propose that the selective requirement for pk sple to orient the R3/R4 decision and their interchangeability for coordination and completion of rotation reflects their previously described differential interaction with the Fat/Dachsous system which is known to be required for orientation of R3/R4 decisions but not for coordination or completion of rotation."
https://openalex.org/W4211205445,"People with drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) are known to suffer from many mental-health disorders. This study aims to describe the proportion of patients diagnosed with psychiatric comorbidities, the different psychiatric diagnoses made, and treatment outcomes among DR-TB patients with or without psychiatric comorbidity and initiated on DR-TB treatment between January 2012 and March 2019 at Médecins Sans Frontières independent clinic in Mumbai, India.This is a retrospective study using routinely collected clinical data. DR-TB care included individualised treatment, psychosocial support, and integrated psychiatric care.During the study period, 341 DR-TB patients were enrolled, with a median age of 25 years (IQR:20.0-36.5 years), 185 (54.2%) females, 143 (41.9%) with PreXDR-TB, and 140 (41.0%) with XDR-TB. All 341 patients were screened by a counsellor, 119 (34.9%) were referred for psychiatric evaluation, and 102 (29.9% of 341) were diagnosed with a psychiatric comorbidity. Among 102 diagnosed with a psychiatric comorbidity, 48 (47.0%) were diagnosed at baseline, and 86 (84.3%), or 25.2% of all 341 patients enrolled, were treated with psychotropic drugs. Depressive disorders were diagnosed in 49 (48.0%), mixed anxiety and depression in 24 (23.5%), neurocognitive disorders and anxiety in five (4.9%), and medication induced psychosis in two (2.0%). No anti-TB drugs were significantly associated with psychiatric comorbidities developed during treatment. Of 102 DR-TB patients with a psychiatric comorbidity, 75.5% (77) had successful DR-TB treatment outcomes, compared to 61.1% (146/239) not diagnosed with a psychiatric comorbidity (p = 0.014).In our setting, among people started on DR-TB treatment, and with a complex TB resistance profile, about one in three patients experienced a psychiatric comorbidity, of which half developed this comorbidity during treatment. With comprehensive psychiatric care integrated into DR-TB care delivery, treatment outcomes were at least as good among those with psychiatric comorbidities compared to those without such comorbidities."
https://openalex.org/W4211241418,"Background and aims Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is a major cause of end-stage liver diseases such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma resulting ultimately in increased liver-related mortality. Fibrosis is the main driver of mortality in NASH. Procollagen C-Proteinase Enhancer-1 (PCPE-1) plays a key role in procollagen maturation and collagen fibril formation. To assess its role in liver fibrosis and NASH progression, knock-out mice were evaluated in a dietary NASH model. Methods Global constitutive Pcolce -/- and WT male mice were fed with a Choline Deficient Amino acid defined High Fat Diet (CDA HFD) for 8 weeks. Liver triglycerides, steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis were assessed at histological, biochemical and gene expression levels. In addition, human liver samples from control and NASH patients were used to evaluate the expression of PCPE-1 at both mRNA and protein levels. Results Pcolce gene deficiency prevented diet-induced liver enlargement but not liver dysfunction. Furthermore, liver triglycerides, steatosis and inflammation were not modified in Pcolce -/- male mice compared to WT under CDA HFD. However, a significant decrease in liver fibrosis was observed in Pcolce -/- mice compared to WT under NASH diet, associated with a decrease in total and insoluble collagen content without any significant modifications in the expression of genes involved in fibrosis and extracellular matrix remodeling. Finally, PCPE-1 protein expression was increased in cirrhotic liver samples from both NASH and Hepatitis C patients. Conclusions Pcolce deficiency limits fibrosis but not NASH progression in CDA HFD fed mice."
https://openalex.org/W4210960777,"Acrachne racemosa (B. Heyne. ex Roem. &amp; Schult.) Ohwi of the subfamily Chloridoideae of the family Poaceae is an economically important grass species. Grasses are characterized by deposits of silica in the cells or tissues in the form of phytoliths which protect them from various types of biotic and abiotic stresses. Owing to variable shape and specificity of morphotypes, phytolith helps in taxonomical studies, reconstruction of paleoenvironments and prediction of climate changes. The present study focussed on developing a phytolith profile of the selected species. For isolation of phytolith, Dry Ashing Method was employed, and by epidermal peeling, in-situ location of phytoliths was deciphered. In the present study, silica percentage was studied from different parts of the plant and the maximum amount was found in the leaf. Frequency and morphometric data of phytolith morphotypes from different parts of the plants were also collected and analyzed. The strongest correlation was found between phytolith types of root and culm by Pearson’s correlation coefficient supported by cluster analysis. The saddle type of phytoliths had the highest frequency in the leaf; other types of phytoliths in different parts of the plant were bilobate, blocky types, elongate types, trapezoids, triangular, cross, sinuate elongate, tabular types, globular types. Functional groups and amorphous polymorphic phases of silica were also analyzed by FTIR and XRD. It was concluded that phytolith types are controlled by parts of plant body and by anatomical and environmental factors."
https://openalex.org/W4211078587,"Importance Phthalates are ubiquitous and many are known or suspected human reproductive and endocrine-disrupting toxicants. A data gap exists in reporting on biomonitoring of phthalate biomarkers in college-aged adults. Objective To analyze phthalate exposure in a cross-sectional sample of female college students using urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and compare to reference populations including college-aged women sampled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods Nine monoester phthalate metabolites were analyzed in spot urine collected from 215 female undergraduates (age 18–22, 2016–2017) at a public university in Charleston, SC USA and a subset of participants completed a questionnaire detailing demographics and behaviors including personal care and cosmetic product use (e.g. in the past 6 or 24 hrs). Urine specific gravity was used to assess effect of urine dilution. Phthalate metabolite concentrations were compared to reference populations and the temporal trends of the same age-group in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were analyzed. Results Total urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations in individuals ranged three orders of magnitude (geometric mean 56.6 ng/mL, IQR 26.6–114 ng/mL). A third of urine samples had relatively high urine specific gravity levels indicating potential dehydration status. All geometric mean concentrations were similar to the U.S. female population in the most recent NHANES cycle (2015–2016) except for MEP and mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP). Relatively low MEP and MiBP may be explained by a time trend of declining MEP in the general U.S. population, the sociocultural character of this cohort, and the time of day of spot sampling in evening. NHANES data indicate a significant effect of sample timing on phthalate metabolite concentrations and decline in most, but not all, phthalate metabolites sampled in women aged 18–22 years over the decade (2005–2016). Significance This study reports phthalate metabolites in college-aged women, an understudied group, emphasizes the benefit of survey information for interpreting biomonitoring data, and is a useful case study for communicating phthalate chemical exposure risks to college students."

The Incremental Net Monetary Benefit (INMB) for COTiD-UK versus TAU was negative at a maximum willingness to pay for a QALY of £20000 (mean -£651, 95% CI -£878 to -£424) or £30000 (mean -£585, 95% CI -£824 to -£345). Extensive sensitivity analyses confirmed the results.This community-based occupational therapy intervention has a very low probability of being cost-effective."
https://openalex.org/W4210959320,"Flooding is one of the main abiotic stresses suffered by plants. Plants respond to flooding stress through regulating their morphological structure, endogenous hormone biosynthesis, and genetic signaling transduction. We previously found that Fokienia hodginsii varieties originating from Gutian exhibited typical flooding tolerance traits compared to three other provenances (Yongzhou, Sanming, Nanping), expressed as increased height, longer diameter at breast height (DBH), and smaller branch angle. Herein, the changes in endogenous gibberellins (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) contents were measured under flooding stress in F. hodginsii, and ABA was found to decrease, whereas GA increased with time. Furthermore, the GA and ABA contents of the varieties originating from Gutian and the three other provenances were measured, and the results indicated that F. hodginsii from Gutian could respond more rapidly to flooding stress. The transcriptomes of the varieties originating from Gutian and the other three provenances were compared using RNA sequencing to explore the underlying genetic mechanisms of the flood-resistant phenotypes in F. hodginsii. The results indicated that two flood-stress response genes (TRINITY_DN142_c0_g2 and TRINITY_DN7657_c0_g1) were highly related to both the ABA and GA response in F. hodginsii."
https://openalex.org/W4211051917,"The faculty of language allows humans to state falsehoods in their choice of words. However, while what is said might easily uphold a lie, how it is said may reveal deception. Hence, some features of the voice that are difficult for liars to control may keep speech mostly, if not always, honest. Previous research has identified that speech timing and voice pitch cues can predict the truthfulness of speech, but this evidence has come primarily from laboratory experiments, which sacrifice ecological validity for experimental control. We obtained ecologically valid recordings of deceptive speech while observing natural utterances from players of a popular social deduction board game, in which players are assigned roles that either induce honest or dishonest interactions. When speakers chose to lie, they were prone to longer and more frequent pauses in their speech. This finding is in line with theoretical predictions that lying is more cognitively demanding. However, lying was not reliably associated with vocal pitch. This contradicts predictions that increased physiological arousal from lying might increase muscular tension in the larynx, but is consistent with human specialisations that grant Homo sapiens sapiens an unusual degree of control over the voice relative to other primates. The present study demonstrates the utility of social deduction board games as a means of making naturalistic observations of human behaviour from semi-structured social interactions."

Residual efficacy of Fludora® Fusion was evaluated against insecticide susceptible Anopheles arabiensis in ten circular huts similar to the residential huts. Fludora® Fusion WP-SB 56.25, FICAM WP80 and Clothianidin WG70 were sprayed, by experienced technician, on interior wall surfaces: paint, dung, smooth mud, and rough mud. WHO cone bioassays were carried out a month after spraying and thereafter on monthly intervals for 12 months. Knockdown was recorded at 60 minutes and mortality at 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours holding time post-exposure. Fludora Fusion induced 100% An. arabiensis mortality during the first four months post-treated on all surface types at 24 hours holding time post-exposure. Its activity remained over 80% from the fifth to the twelfth month post-treated on the surfaces with the exception of two assessment points, at seventh month and eleventh month, on paint and smooth mud surfaces. FICAM induced 100% mortality rate during the first 4 months and 92% mortality during the fifth month post-treatment on painted surfaces. Its activity was over 96% mortality 1-month post-treatment on smooth mud and rough mud surfaces and 92% mortality 2-month post-treatment on dung surfaces. Clothianidin caused 89% and 86% mortality 1-month post-treatment on smooth mud and rough mud surfaces.

In this research, various edaphic characteristics: pH, soil organic matter, organic carbon, water holding capacity, cation exchange capacity and heavy metal contamination in soils nearby of brickkilns were determined. The pH of soil ranged from 5.55 to 7.50, soil organic matter was 0.35–0.90% and organic carbon content was 0.65–1.40%. The water holding capacity ranged from 2.10 to 3.20 mgL -1 and carbon exchange capacity was 1250 to 4202 meq/100g. The contamination profile of heavy metal depicted that Pb showed highest conc. 0.065 mg/g followed by Co (0.053 mg/g) and Ni with 0.52 mg/g in the soil. Pb and Cr had high conc. in soil samples around brickkilns due to burning of coal and rubber tyres as fuel. The conc. of sulphate and nitrate ranged from 0.90±0.50 mol L -1 to 4.25±0.65 mol L -1 and 2.30±0.50 mol L -1 to 6.55±0.25 mol L -1 , respectively. The fertility of agriculture lands was depicted that edaphic properties were directly related while nutritive features were inversely commensurate to distance from brickkilns. The research proved that emanations of brickkilns causes severe impact on quality of agriculture land, plant growth and its yield. Hence, reclamation measures should be taken to mitigate and/or eradicate nuisance of brickkilns emanations by using environmental friendly strategies."

In view of the low reconstruction accuracy based on small data and the subjectivity of threshold to infer adjacency matrix, the paper proposes two models: the quadratic compressive sensing (QCS) and integer compressive sensing (ICS). Then a combined method (CCS) is given based on QCS and ICS, which can be used on binary-state and multi-state dynamics. It is found that CCS is usually a superior method comparing with compressive sensing, LASSO on several networks with different structures and scales. And it can infer larger node correctly than the other two methods.

Although emergency contraceptives are widely available in Ethiopia, termination of pregnancy remains a public health problem indicating low uptake of emergency contraceptives after unprotected sexual intercourse. This study aimed to assess utilization and determinants of emergency contraceptives among women seeking termination of pregnancy in Northwest Ethiopia.An institutional-based cross-sectional study was carried out, supplemented by phenomenologically approached in-depth interviews. Systematic random sampling was used to select study participants. A structured questionnaire and an in-depth interview guide were used to collect data. Data were entered by EPI-info and analyzed through SPSS version 23 to conduct logistic regressions. Thematic analysis was used to conduct qualitative interpretation.Almost one-fifth (78; 19.2%) of the study participants used emergency contraceptives to prevent their index pregnancy. Women who had secondary education (aOR 3.28; 95% CI 1.59, 6.79) and women who had no living children (aOR 4.52; 95% CI 1.40, 14.57) had a positive significant association with emergency contraceptive utilization. On the other hand, women who did not discuss contraceptives with their sexual partner (aOR 0.49; 95% CI 0.27-0.91) and women without a history of abortion (aOR 0.45; 95% CI 0.24-0.97) had a negative significant association with emergency contraceptive utilization.There is relatively low utilization of emergency contraception among pregnancy terminating women. Reproductive health programs should encourage women discussion with their partners about emergency contraceptives to decrease occurrence of unwanted pregnancy and termination of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4211129582,"Transcriptional regulator PEAPOD (PPD) and its binding partners comprise a complex that is conserved throughout many core eudicot plants with regard to protein domain sequence and the function of controlling organ size and shape. Orthologues of PPD also exist in the basal angiosperm Amborella trichopoda , various gymnosperm species, the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii and several monocot genera, although until now it was not known if these are functional sequences. Here we report constitutive expression of orthologues from species representing diverse taxa of plant phylogeny in the Arabidopsis Δ ppd mutant. PPD orthologues from S . moellendorffii , gymnosperm Picea abies , A . trichopoda , monocot Musa acuminata , and dicot Trifolium repens were able to complement the mutant and return it to the wild-type phenotype, demonstrating the conserved functionality of PPD throughout vascular plants. In addition, analysis of bryophyte genomes revealed potential PPD orthologues in model liverwort and moss species, suggesting a more primitive lineage for this conserved regulator. The Poaceae (grasses) lack the genes for the PPD module and the reason for loss of the complex from this economically significant family is unclear, given that grasses were the last of the flowering plants to evolve. Bioinformatic analyses identified putative PPD orthologues in close relatives of the Poaceae, indicating that the explanation for absence of PPD in the grasses may be more complex than previously considered. Understanding the mechanisms which led to loss of PPD from the grasses will provide insight into evolution of the Poaceae."
https://openalex.org/W4211131912,"Purpose We aimed to evaluate the long-term outcome of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients who underwent both procedures on different sides. Methods In this single-center retrospective study (2001–2019), 117 patients (men, N = 78; median age at CEA, 64.4 [interquartile range {IQR}, 57.8–72.2] years; median age at CAS, 68.8 [IQR, 61.0–76.0] years) with ≥50% internal carotid artery stenosis who had CEA on one side and CAS on the other side were included. The risk of restenosis was estimated by treatment adjusted for patient and lesion characteristics. Results Neurological symptoms were significantly more common (41.9% vs 16.2%, P&lt;0.001) and patients had a significantly shorter mean duration of smoking (30.2 [standard deviation {SD}, 22.2] years vs 31.8 [SD, 23.4] years, P&lt;0.001), hypertension (10.1 [SD, 9.8] years vs 13.4 [SD, 9.1] years, P&lt;0.001), hyperlipidemia (3.6 [SD, 6.6] years vs 5.0 [SD, 7.3] years, P = 0.001), and diabetes mellitus (3.9 [SD, 6.9] years vs 5.7 [SD, 8.9] years, P&lt;0.001) before CEA compared to those before CAS. While the prevalence of heavily calcified stenoses on the operated side (25.6% vs 6.8%, P&lt;0.001), the incidence of predominantly echogenic/echogenic plaques (53.0% vs 70.1%, P = 0.011) and suprabulbar lesions (1.7% vs 22.2%, P&lt;0.001) on the stented side was significantly higher. Restenosis rates were 10.4% at 1 year, 22.3% at 5 years, and 33.7% at the end of the follow-up (at 11 years) for CEA, while these were 11.4%, 14.7%, and 17.2%, respectively, for CAS. Cox regression analysis revealed a significantly higher risk of restenosis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05–3.10; P = 0.030) for CEA compared to that for CAS. After adjusting for relevant confounding factors (smoking, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, calcification severity, plaque echogenicity, and lesion location), the estimate effect size materially did not change, although it did not remain statistically significant (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 0.95–3.60; P = 0.070). Conclusion Intra-patient comparison of CEA and CAS in terms of restenosis tilts the balance toward CAS."
https://openalex.org/W4211157000,"Background The perception of the transmission risks of SARS-CoV-2 in social and educational settings by US healthcare providers have not been previously quantified. Methods Respondents completed an online survey between September and October 2020 to estimate the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on a scale of 0–10 for different social and educational activities prior to the availability of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Demographic information and experiences during the pandemic were also collected. The risk assessment was emailed to three listservs of healthcare providers, including national listservs of pediatric (PID) and adult infectious diseases (AID) providers, and a listserv of general pediatric practitioners in the St Louis, USA metropolitan area. Results Respondents identified the highest risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in spending time in a bar, eating at a restaurant, and attending an indoor sporting event. In the school setting, lower risk was identified in elementary and daycare students compared to high school or university-level students. Comparatively, the risk of transmission to students and teachers was lower than the identified high-risk social activities. Factors increasing risk perception in social activities included the absence of children in the respondent’s household and female gender. For the school setting, AID providers perceived greater risk compared to PID providers or pediatric practitioners. Conclusions Respondents identified high risk activities that were associated with a high density of participants in an indoor space where masks are removed for eating and drinking. Differences were apparent in the school setting where pediatric providers perceived lower risks when compared to adult providers."
https://openalex.org/W4211158199,"We present the design and characterization of an X-ray imaging system consisting of an off-the-shelf CMOS sensor optically coupled to a CsI scintillator. The camera can perform both high-resolution and functional cardiac imaging. High-resolution 3D imaging requires microfocus X-ray tubes and expensive detectors, while pre-clinical functional cardiac imaging requires high flux pulsed (clinical) X-ray tubes and high-end cameras. Our work describes an X-ray camera, namely an ""optically coupled X-ray(OCX) detector,"" used for both the aforementioned applications with no change in the specifications. We constructed the imaging detector with two different CMOS optical imaging cameras called CMOS sensors, 1.A monochrome CMOS sensor coupled with an f1.4 lens and 2.an RGB CMOS sensor coupled with an f0.95 prime lens. The imaging system consisted of our X-ray camera, micro-focus X-ray source (50kVp and 1mA), and a rotary stage controlled from a personal computer (PC) and LabVIEW interface. The detective quantum efficiency (DQE) of the imaging system(monochrome) estimated using a cascaded linear model was 17% at 10 lp/mm. The system modulation transfer function (MTF) and the noise power spectrum (NPS) were inputs to the DQE estimation. Because of the RGB camera's low quantum efficiency (QE), the OCX detector DQE was 19% at 5 lp/mm. The contrast to noise ratio (CNR) at different frame rates was studied using the capillary tubes filled with various dilutions of iodinated contrast agents. In-vivo cardiac angiography demonstrated that blood vessels of the order of 100 microns or above were visible at 40 frames per second despite the low X-ray flux. For high-resolution 3D imaging, the system was characterized by imaging a cylindrical micro-CT contrast phantom and comparing it against images from a commercial scanner."
https://openalex.org/W4211160423,"Neonatal meningitis-associated Escherichia coli (NMEC) is among the leading causes of bacterial meningitis and sepsis in newborn infants. Several virulence factors have been identified as common among NMEC, and have been shown to play an important role in the development of bacteremia and/or meningitis. However, there is significant variability in virulence factor expression between NMEC isolates, and relatively little research has been done to assess the impact of variable virulence factor expression on immune cell activation and the outcome of infection. Here, we investigated the role of NMEC strain-dependent P2X receptor (P2XR) signaling on the outcome of infection in neonatal mice. We found that alpha-hemolysin (HlyA)-expressing NMEC (HlyA+ ) induced robust P2XR-dependent macrophage cell death in vitro, while HlyA- NMEC did not. P2XR-dependent cell death was inflammasome independent, suggesting an uncoupling of P2XR and inflammasome activation in the context of NMEC infection. In vivo inhibition of P2XRs was associated with increased mortality in neonatal mice infected with HlyA+ NMEC, but had no effect on the survival of neonatal mice infected with HlyA- NMEC. Furthermore, we found that P2XR-dependent protection against HlyA+ NMEC in vivo required macrophages, but not neutrophils or NLRP3. Taken together, these data suggest that HlyA+ NMEC activates P2XRs which in turn confers macrophage-dependent protection against infection in neonates. In addition, our findings indicate that strain-dependent virulence factor expression should be taken into account when studying the immune response to NMEC."
https://openalex.org/W4211184870,"Aortic calcification in the tunica media is correlated with aortic stiffness, elastin degradation, and wall shear stress. The study aim was to determine if aortic calcifications influence disease progression in patients with acute type A aortic dissection (ATAAD). We retrospectively reviewed a total of 103 consecutive patients who had undergone surgery for ATAAD at our institution between January 2009 and December 2019. Of these, 85 patients who had preoperatively undergone plain computed tomography angiography (CTA) for evaluation of their aortic calcification were included. Moreover, we assessed the progression of aortic dissection after surgery via postoperative CTA. Using a classification and regression tree to identify aortic Agatston score thresholds predictive of disease progression, the patients were classified into high-score (Agatston score ≥ 3344; n = 36) and low-score (<3344; n = 49) groups. Correlations between aortic Agatston scores and CTA variables were assessed. Higher aortic Agatston scores were significantly correlated with the smaller distal extent of aortic dissection (p < 0.001), larger true lumen areas of the ascending (p = 0.009) and descending aorta (p = 0.002), and smaller false lumen areas of the descending aorta (p = 0.028). Patients in the high-score group were more likely to have DeBakey type II dissection (p = 0.001) and false lumen thrombosis (p = 0.027) than those in the low-score group, thereby confirming the correlations. Aortic dissection in the high-score group was significantly less distally extended (p < 0.001). A higher aortic Agatston score correlates with the larger true lumen area of the ascending and descending aorta and the less distal progression of aortic dissection in patients with ATAAD. Interestingly, the findings before and after surgery were consistent. Hence, aortic Agatston scores are associated with aortic dissection progression and may help predict postoperative residual dissected aorta remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W4210982658,"In two eye-tracking reading experiments, we used a variant of the filled gap technique to investigate how strong and weak islands are processed on a moment-to-moment basis during comprehension. Experiment 1 provided a conceptual replication of previous studies showing that real time processing is sensitive to strong islands. In the absence of an island, readers experienced processing difficulty when a pronoun appeared in a position of a predicted gap, but this difficulty was absent when the pronoun appeared inside a strong island. Experiment 2 showed an analogous effect for weak islands: a processing cost was seen for a pronoun in the position of a predicted gap in a that-complement clause, but this cost was absent in a matched whether clause, which constitutes a weak island configuration. Overall, our results are compatible with the claim that active dependency formation is suspended, or reduced, in both weak and strong island structures."
https://openalex.org/W4211005403,"Background In this study, we investigated subjective geriatric complaints (SGCs) as conditions regarding health concerns in community-dwelling older people and analyzed their frequencies with aging and relationships with other factors. Methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 10,434 older people living in a community with a representative aging population in Japan. A questionnaire was sent by mail to those who had not applied for formal care needs certification. The presence of and concern for symptoms common in old age were asked as SGCs, as were physical function levels, multimorbidity, and depression. Categorical principal component analysis (CATPCA) of the symptoms was performed, and the association between the obtained components and other factors was analyzed. Results The mean age of the participants was 73.7 ± 6.1 years, and 52.5% were women. On average, they had 1.72 ± 1.57 SGCs, which showed a gradual increase with age. The results of the CATPCA revealed four components: SGC1, excretory/circulatory/swallowing complaints; SGC2, audiovisual complaints; SGC3, neurological complaints; and SGC4, musculoskeletal complaints. All SGC components were independently associated with physical function, multimorbidity, and depression. Conclusions Each SGC showed various frequencies and differences along with aging, and SGCs were classified into four components that were thought to share a common background. These findings could contribute to the planning of better health management strategies for older people."
https://openalex.org/W4211074937,"What is difficult is not usually pleasurable. Yet, for certain unfamiliar figurative language, like that which is common in poetry, while comprehension is often more difficult than for more conventional language, it is in many cases more pleasurable. Concentrating our investigation on verb-based metaphors, we examined whether and to what degree the novel variations (in the form of verb changes and extensions) of conventional verb metaphors were both more difficult to comprehend and yet induced more pleasure. To test this relationship, we developed a set of 62 familiar metaphor stimuli, each with corresponding optimal and excessive verb variation and metaphor extension conditions, and normed these stimuli using both objective measures and participant subjective ratings. We then tested the pleasure-difficulty relationship with an online behavioral study. Based on Rachel Giora and her colleagues' 'optimal innovation hypothesis', we anticipated an inverse U-shaped relationship between ease and pleasure, with an optimal degree of difficulty, introduced by metaphor variations, producing the highest degree of pleasure when compared to familiar or excessive conditions. Results, however, revealed a more complex picture, with only metaphor extension conditions (not verb variation conditions) producing the anticipated pleasure effects. Individual differences in semantic cognition and verbal reasoning assessed using the Semantic Similarities Test, while clearly influential, further complicated the pleasure-difficulty relationship, suggesting an important avenue for further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W4226158865,"Because it is impossible to comprehensively characterize biodiversity at all levels of organization, conservation prioritization efforts need to rely on surrogates. As species distribution maps of relished groups as well as high-resolution remotely sensed data increasingly become available, both types of surrogates are commonly used. A good surrogate should represent as much of biodiversity as possible, but it often remains unclear to what extent this is the case. Here, we aimed to address this question by assessing how well bird species and habitat diversity represent one another. We conducted our study in Romania, a species-rich country with high landscape heterogeneity where bird species distribution data have only recently started to become available. First, we prioritized areas for conservation based on either 137 breeding bird species or 36 habitat classes, and then evaluated their reciprocal surrogacy performance. Second, we examined how well these features are represented in already existing protected areas. Finally, we identified target regions of high conservation value for the potential expansion of the current network of reserves (as planned under the new EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030). We found a limited reciprocal surrogacy performance, with bird species performing slightly better as a conservation surrogate for habitat diversity than vice versa. We could also show that areas with a high conservation value based on habitat diversity were represented better in already existing protected areas than areas based on bird species, which varied considerably between species. Our results highlight that taxonomic and environmental (i.e., habitat types) data may perform rather poorly as reciprocal surrogates, and multiple sources of data are required for a full evaluation of protected areas expansion."
