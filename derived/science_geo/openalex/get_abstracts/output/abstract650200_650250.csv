https://openalex.org/W3015020891,"Ferroptotic cell death and cancer Cell death can occur through different mechanisms, several of which are being explored as potential targets for cancer treatment. One form of cell death that has attracted recent interest is ferroptosis, which is triggered by high intracellular levels of lipid reactive oxygen species. Pancreatic cancer cells have high levels of reactive oxygen species but manage to avoid ferroptosis by importing extracellular cysteine. Studying mice bearing pancreatic tumors, Badgley et al. found that administration of a drug inhibiting cysteine import induced tumor-selective ferroptosis and inhibited tumor growth. Further work will be required to determine whether this therapeutic strategy will be effective in human pancreatic cancer, a tumor type for which new treatments are urgently needed.

Cancer-killing PARP-1 inhibitor (PARPi) compounds all block the same catalytic site but exhibit vastly different efficacy. Zandarashvili et al. investigated the molecular impact of PARPi binding to PARP-1 (see the Perspective by Slade and Eustermann). Different PARPi molecules perturb PARP-1 allostery in diverse manners: Some drive allostery to promote release of PARP-1 from DNA, and others drive allostery to promote retention. These insights help explain the different efficacies in the clinic and enable conversion of a pro-release, ineffective cancer-killing compound to a pro-retention, more effective PARPi.

https://openalex.org/W3014953422,"Understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of emotion relies on objective readouts of the emotional state of an individual, which remains a major challenge especially in animal models. We found that mice exhibit stereotyped facial expressions in response to emotionally salient events, as well as upon targeted manipulations in emotion-relevant neuronal circuits. Facial expressions were classified into distinct categories using machine learning and reflected the changing intrinsic value of the same sensory stimulus encountered under different homeostatic or affective conditions. Facial expressions revealed emotion features such as intensity, valence, and persistence. Two-photon imaging uncovered insular cortical neuron activity that correlated with specific facial expressions and may encode distinct emotions. Facial expressions thus provide a means to infer emotion states and their neuronal correlates in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3014096229,"The design of modular protein logic for regulating protein function at the posttranscriptional level is a challenge for synthetic biology. Here, we describe the design of two-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, and NOT gates built from de novo-designed proteins. These gates regulate the association of arbitrary protein units ranging from split enzymes to transcriptional machinery in vitro, in yeast and in primary human T cells, where they control the expression of the TIM3 gene related to T cell exhaustion. Designed binding interaction cooperativity, confirmed by native mass spectrometry, makes the gates largely insensitive to stoichiometric imbalances in the inputs, and the modularity of the approach enables ready extension to three-input OR, AND, and disjunctive normal form gates. The modularity and cooperativity of the control elements, coupled with the ability to de novo design an essentially unlimited number of protein components, should enable the design of sophisticated posttranslational control logic over a wide range of biological functions."

Among the knobs that can be used to control their properties are magnetic field and strain. Hong et al. placed membranes of La 0.7 Ca 0.3 MnO 3 on a flexible polymer layer (see the Perspective by Beekman). Stretching the flexible layer resulted in large strains of up to 8% on the membrane. By varying the magnitude and direction of the strain, the researchers were able to explore the phase diagram of the system and influence its magnetic and transport properties.

https://openalex.org/W3014112609,"Soybean (Glycine max L. Merrill) is an economically important commodity for United States agriculture. Nonetheless, the profitability of soybean production has been negatively impacted by soybean diseases. The economic impacts of 23 common soybean diseases were estimated in 28 soybean-producing states in the U.S., from 1996 to 2016 (the entire data set consisted of 13,524 data points). Estimated losses were investigated using a variety of statistical approaches. The main effects of state, year, pre- and post-discovery of soybean rust, region, and zones based on yield, harvest area, and production, were significant on “total economic loss” as a function of diseases. Across states and years, the soybean cyst nematode, charcoal rot, and seedling diseases were the most economically damaging diseases while soybean rust, bacterial blight, and southern blight were the least economically damaging. A significantly greater mean loss (51%) was observed in states/years after the discovery of soybean rust (2004 to 2016) compared to the pre-discovery (1996 to 2003). From 1996 to 2016, the total estimated economic loss due to soybean diseases in the U.S. was $95.48 billion, with $80.89 billion and $14.59 billion accounting for the northern and southern U.S. losses, respectively. Over the entire time period, the average annual economic loss due to soybean diseases in the U.S. reached nearly $4.55 billion, with approximately 85% of the losses occurring in the northern U.S. Low yield/harvest/production zones had significantly lower mean economic losses due to diseases in comparison to high yield/harvest/production zones. This observation was further bolstered by the observed positive linear correlation of mean soybean yield loss (in each state, due to all diseases considered in this study, across 21 years) with the mean state wide soybean production (MT), mean soybean yield (kg ha-1), and mean soybean harvest area (ha). Results of this investigation provide useful insights into how research, policy, and educational efforts should be prioritized in soybean disease management"

Using liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy, Kim et al. reconstructed the structure of individual nanocrystals synthesized in one batch while they were still in solution. A comparison of multiple particles showed structural heterogeneity and differences between the interior and the outer shell of the individual nanoparticles, as well as nanoparticles containing extended defects and thus differences in internal strain, all of which can affect the physical and chemical properties of each particle.

https://openalex.org/W3014934999,"Dating the Drimolen hominins Fossil hominins from South Africa are enriching the story of early human evolution and dispersal. Herries et al. describe the geological context and dating of the hominin-bearing infilled cave, or palaeocave, at a site called Drimolen in South Africa (see the Perspective by Antón). They focus on the age and context of a recently discovered Homo erectus sensu lato fossil and a Paranthropus robustus fossil, which they dated to ∼2.04 million to 1.95 million years ago. This makes Drimolen one of the best-dated sites in South Africa and establishes these fossils as the oldest definitive specimens of their respective species ever discovered. The age confirms that species of Australopithecus, Paranthropus , and early Homo overlapped in the karst of South Africa ∼2 million years ago. Science , this issue p. eaaw7293 ; see also p. 34"

Min et al. reexamined this issue with high-throughput live-cell imaging and temporally controlled perturbations to more closely monitor dynamic signal processing. Human epithelial cells in culture integrated the mitogenic signals sensed throughout the cell cycle. One important factor was the control of translation rates, which influenced the amount of cyclin D, thus regulating proliferation. The results may also help to explain how cells maintain a uniform size. Science , this issue p. 1261"

https://openalex.org/W3014178526,"Site-specific atom probe tomography (APT) from aluminum alloys has been limited by sample preparation issues. Indeed, Ga, which is conventionally used in focused-ion beam (FIB) preparations, has a high affinity for Al grain boundaries and causes their embrittlement. This leads to high concentrations of Ga at grain boundaries after specimen preparation, unreliable compositional analyses and low specimen yield. Here, to tackle this problem, we propose to use cryo-FIB for APT specimen preparation specifically from grain boundaries in a commercial Al-alloy. We demonstrate how this setup, easily implementable on conventional Ga-FIB instruments, is efficient to prevent Ga diffusion to grain boundaries. Specimens were prepared at room temperature and at cryogenic temperature (below approx. 90K) are compared, and we confirm that at room temperature, a compositional enrichment above 15 at.% of Ga is found at the grain boundary, whereas no enrichment could be detected for the cryo-prepared sample. We propose that this is due to the decrease of the diffusion rate of Ga at low temperature. The present results could have a high impact on the understanding of aluminum and Al-alloys."

https://openalex.org/W3014562260,"Background Newborn screening (NBS) aims to achieve early identification and treatment of affected infants prior to onset of symptoms. The timely completion of each step (i.e., specimen collection, transport, testing, result reporting), is critical for early diagnosis. Goals developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services’ Advisory Committee on Heritable Disorders in Newborns and Children (ACHDNC) for NBS timeliness were adopted (time-critical results reported by five days of life, and non-time-critical results reported by day seven), and implemented into a multi-year quality improvement initiative (NewSTEPS 360) aimed to decrease the time to result reporting and intervention. Methods The NBS system from specimen collection through reporting of results was assessed (bloodspot specimen collection, specimen shipping, sample testing, and result reporting). Annual data from 25 participating NBS programs were analyzed; the medians (and interquartile range, IQR) of state-specific percent of specimens that met the goal are presented. Results The percent of specimens collected before 48 hours of life increased from 95% (88–97%) in 2016 to 97% (IQR 92–98%) in 2018 for the 25 states, with 20 (80%) of programs collecting more than 90% of the specimens within 48 hours of birth. Approximately 41% (IQR 29–57%) of specimens were transported within one day of collection. Time-critical result reporting in the first five days of life improved from 49% (IQR 26–74%) in 2016 to 64% (42%-71%) in 2018, and for non-time critical results from 64% (IQR 58%-78%) in 2016 to 81% (IQR 68–91%) in 2018. Laboratories open seven days a week in 2018 reported 95% of time-critical results within five days, compared to those open six days (62%), and five days (45%). Conclusion NBS programs that participated in NewSTEPs 360 made great strides in improving timeliness; however, ongoing quality improvement efforts are needed in order to ensure all infants receive a timely diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W3014951900,"Introduction The use of WhatsApp for health professional education is not novel and is described increasingly in literature as an affordable, familiar, and convenient tool for collaboration. Social media technologies for health practitioner education allow the use of text and audio-visual aids, peer-to-peer based learning, and problem-based learning. This study presents a survey on the effectiveness of WhatsApp in doctors’ preparation for a medical licensing exam. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among one hundred and ninety-four participants of a WhatsApp group preparing for the PLAB exam over a three-month period. A twenty-item questionnaire designed on Google Form was completed by consenting participants on the publication of exam results. Results Of the one hundred and ninety-four participants, one hundred and fourteen met the eligibility criteria, 57.9 percent were male and 42.1 percent were female, aged between twenty-four and forty-three years of age ( years). A total of 88.6 percent of participants passed the exam in contrast to the global average pass rate of 69 percent, while the average score among participants was 131.5 compared to a global average score of 128. Passing the exam was significantly associated with combining the WhatsApp group with the online question bank Plabable (p = 0.001). While the mean age of those who passed the PLAB exam was lower than those who did not pass the exam, the number of years post-graduation had no significant association with passing the exam. A total of 93.8 percent stated that moderators were knowledgeable, 83.3 percent reported that the platform increased their motivation to learn, 72.8 percent felt that the session were organised and easy-to-follow, and 97.4 percent of participants reported they would recommend the PLAB network. Conclusion WhatsApp can be an effective tool for health professional education, using a pre-defined curriculum coupled with organizational structure. This study reported both subjective and objective measures of effectiveness and demonstrated that the use of multiple e-learning resources can lead to improved learning outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3014494228,"Background In sub-Saharan Africa, a third of people starting antiretroviral therapy and majority of patients returning to HIV-care after disengagement, present with advanced HIV disease (ADH), and are at high risk of mortality. Simplified and more affordable point-of-care (POC) diagnostics are required to increase access to prompt CD4 cell count screening for ambulatory and asymptomatic patients. The Visitect CD4 Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) is a disposable POC test, providing a visually interpreted result of above or below 200 CD4cells/mm3. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of this index test. Methods Consenting patients above 18years of age and eligible for CD4 testing were enrolled in Nsanje district hospital (Malawi), Gutu mission hospital (Zimbabwe) and Centre hopitalier de Kabinda (DRC). A total of 708 venous blood samples were tested in the index test and in the BD FACSCount assay (reference test method) in the laboratories (Phase 1) to determine diagnostic accuracy. A total of 433 finger-prick (FP) samples were tested on the index test at POC by clinicians (Phase 2) and a self-completed questionnaire was administered to all testers to explore usability of the index test. Results Among 708 patients, 67.2% were female and median CD4 was 297cells/mm3. The sensitivity of the Visitect CD4 LFA using venous blood in the laboratory was 95.0% [95% CI: 91.3–97.5] and specificity was 81.9% [95% CI: 78.2–85.2%]. Using FP samples, the sensitivity of the Visitect CD4 LFA was 98.3% [95% CI: 95.0–99.6] and specificity was 77.2% [95% CI: 71.6–82.2%]. Usability of the Visitect CD4 LFA was high across the study sites with 97% successfully completed tests. Due to the required specific multiple incubation and procedural steps during the Visitect CD4 LFA testing, few health workers (7/26) were not confident to manage testing whilst multi-tasking in their clinical work. Conclusions Visitect CD4 LFA is a promising test for decentralized CD4 screening in resource-limited settings, without access to CD4 testing and and it can trigger prompt management of patients with AHD. Lay health cadres should be considered to conduct Visitect CD4 LFA testing in PHCs as well as coordinating all other POC quality assurance."

https://openalex.org/W3014658809,"Predictive learning exerts a powerful influence over choice between instrumental actions. Nevertheless, how this learning is encoded in a sufficiently stable manner to influence choices that can occur much later in time is unclear. Here, we report that the basolateral amygdala (BLA) encodes predictive learning and establishes the memory necessary for future choices by driving the accumulation of delta-opioid receptors (DOPRs) on the somatic membrane of cholinergic interneurons in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAc-S). We found that the BLA controls DOPR accumulation via its influence on substance P release in the NAc-S, and that although DOPR accumulation is not necessary for predictive learning per se, it is necessary for the influence of this learning on later choice between actions. This study uncovers, therefore, a novel GPCR-based form of memory that is established by predictive learning and is necessary for such learning to guide the selection and execution of specific actions."

The relative affinities of SpCas9–gRNA and its engineered variants for canonical and suboptimal PAMs correlated with previous findings on the efficiency of these PAM sequences in genome editing.

https://openalex.org/W3014819599,"Increased periods of prolonged droughts followed by severe precipitation events are expected throughout South America due to climate change. Freshwater sediments are especially sensitive to these changing climate conditions. The increased oscillation of water levels in aquatic ecosystems causes enhanced cycles of sediment drying and rewetting. Here we experimentally evaluate the effects of induced drought followed by a rewetting event on the release of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), and trace elements (iron, manganese, and zinc) from the sediment of a tropical reservoir in southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we used bulb onions (Allium cepa) to assess the potential cytogenotoxicity of the water overlying sediments after rewetting. We found peaks in CO2 and CH4 emissions when sediments first transitioned from wet to dry, with fluxes declining as sediments dried out. CO2 emissions peaked again upon rewetting, whereas CH4 emissions remained unaltered. Our experiment also revealed average increases by up to a factor of ~5000 in the release rates of nutrients and trace elements in water overlying sediments after rewetting. These increased release rates of potentially toxic compounds likely explain the lower replication of Allium cepa cells (up to 22% reduction) exposed to water overlying sediments after rewetting. Our findings suggest that increased events of drought followed by rewetting may lead to a range of changes in freshwater ecosystems, including nutrient enrichment, increased toxicity following resuspension of contaminants, and higher emission of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere."

Here, using a fluorescent arrestin assay, we confirmed that the common fungal airway pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus activates heterologously-expressed PAR-2. Endogenous PAR-2 activation in submerged airway RPMI 2650 or NCI–H520 squamous cells increased intracellular calcium levels and granulocyte macrophage–colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor α, and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion. RPMI 2650 cells cultured at an air–liquid interface (ALI) responded to apically or basolaterally applied PAR-2 agonists. However, well-differentiated primary nasal epithelial ALIs responded only to basolateral PAR-2 stimulation, indicated by calcium elevation, increased cilia beat frequency, and increased fluid and cytokine secretion. We exposed primary cells to disease-related modifiers that alter epithelial morphology, including IL-13, cigarette smoke condensate, and retinoic acid deficiency, at concentrations and times that altered epithelial morphology without causing breakdown of the epithelial barrier to model early disease states.

https://openalex.org/W3014931750,"Purpose To determine whether teleophthalmology can help physicians in assessing and managing eye conditions and to ascertain which clinical conditions can be addressed by teleophthalmology in primary care setting. Methods We evaluated the resolution capacity of TeleOftalmo, strategy implemented in the public health system of southern Brazil. Resolution capacity was defined as the ability to fully address patients’ eye complaints in primary care with remote assistance from ophthalmologists. Data from tele-eye reports were collected over 14 months. Resolution capacity was compared across different age groups and different ocular conditions. Results Overall, 8,142 patients had a tele-eye report issued in the study period. Resolution capacity was achieved in 5,748 (70.6%) patients. When stratified into age groups, the lowest capacity was 43.1% among subjects aged ≥65 years, while the highest was 89.7% among subjects aged 13–17 years (p<0.001). Refractive error (70.3%) and presbyopia (56.3%) were the most prevalent conditions followed by cataract (12.4%) and suspected glaucoma (7.6%). Resolution capacity was higher in cases of refractive error, presbyopia, spasm of accommodation and lid disorders than in patients diagnosed with other condition (p<0.001). Conclusions With telemedicine support, primary care physicians solved over two-thirds of patients’ eye or vision complaints. Refractive errors had high case resolution rates, thus having a great impact on reducing the number of referrals to specialty care. Teleophthalmology adoption in primary-care settings as part of the workup of patients with eye or vision complaints promotes a more effective use of specialty centers and will hopefully reduce waiting times for specialty referral."

Chemokine receptors: multifaceted therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2 (11910892): 106-11510.1038/nri722Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 6Russo R.C. Garcia C.C. Teixeira M.M. Anti-inflammatory drug development: broad or specific chemokine receptor antagonists?.Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2010; 13 (20597027): 414-427PubMed Google Scholar). Among the many factors contributing to the failure of clinical trials, one is the complexity of chemokine signaling networks (6Russo R.C. Garcia C.C. Teixeira M.M. Anti-inflammatory drug development: broad or specific chemokine receptor antagonists?.Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Devel. 2010; 13 (20597027): 414-427PubMed Google Scholar). For example, most leukocytes express multiple chemokine receptors with interconnected intracellular signaling networks. Thus, inhibition of one receptor could be bypassed by compensatory signaling via a different receptor. Consequently, it may be advantageous to block certain intracellular effectors or pathways, perhaps in combination with receptor inhibition to avoid such compensatory effects. To identify appropriate targets for such an approach, we need a holistic understanding of the signaling networks stimulated by chemokine receptor activation.

Moreover, in a phase II clinical trial, inhibition of CCR2, using a humanized mAb, significantly reduced levels of C-reactive protein, an atherosclerosis biomarker (11Gilbert J. Lekstrom-Himes J.

In type 2 diabetes, macrophage infiltration into adipose tissue is promoted by activation of CCR2. Thus, knockout or inhibition of CCR2 in mouse models reduced body mass and plasma glucose and restored insulin sensitivity (12Brown M.F. Avery M. Brissette W.H. Chang J.H. Colizza K. Conklyn M.

Pasternak A. CCR2 antagonists.Curr. Top. Med.

To gain comprehensive insights into signal transduction downstream of CCR2 activation, we have performed an unbiased systems-level phosphoproteomic analysis using data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS, which is the state-of-the-art approach to quantify thousands of peptides and proteins with superior quantitative accuracy (15Lawrence R.T. Searle B.C. Llovet A. Villén J. Plug-and-play analysis of the human phosphoproteome by targeted high-resolution mass spectrometry.Nat.

Specifically, we characterized the global phosphoproteome in CCR2-expressing human endothelial kidney (HEK293) cells in response to an activation time course with the principal endogenous chemokine agonist CCL2. This approach represents an advance on traditional candidate-based second-messenger assays proximal to receptor activation and offered opportunities to identify new nodes in the CCR2 signaling network. Indeed, the extensive signaling network identified from the protein phosphorylation data included expected chemokine receptor signaling pathways as well as numerous additional proteins, pointing to potential novel targets related to CCR2 signaling. We have previously generated a CCR2-expressing cell line (FlpIn-HEK293T-CCR2) to investigate chemokine-mediated second-messenger signaling, including cAMP inhibition, β-arrestin recruitment, and internalization (18Huma Z.E. Sanchez J. Lim H.D. Bridgford J.L. Huang C. Parker B.J. Pazhamalil J.G. Porebski B.T. Pfleger K.D.G. Lane J.R. Canals M. Stone M.J.

Signal. 2017; 10 (28536301): eaai852910.1126/scisignal.aai8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Building on these findings, we sought to characterize the signaling networks stimulated by CCR2 activation in greater detail using phosphoproteomics. To study the kinetics of the underlying phosphorylation events, we performed a time course experiment in which FlpIn-HEK293T-CCR2 cells were treated with the full agonist CCL2 at a concentration (100 nm) that maximally activates CCR2 (18Huma Z.E.

Signal. 2017; 10 (28536301): eaai852910.1126/scisignal.aai8529Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 25, and 60 min prior to harvest. Unstimulated FlpIn-HEK293T-CCR2 cells served as negative control, and each time point—including the 0-min control—was analyzed in biological triplicates (Fig. 1). The extracted proteins from each sample were digested with trypsin, and phosphopeptides were enriched using TiO2 chromatography after 10% of the tryptic digest had been removed for global proteome analysis. Both the enriched phosphopeptides and the aliquots of tryptic peptides were analyzed and quantified by DIA MS. Compared with other methods of peptide quantification, the DIA approach has improved accuracy and reproducibility and is not biased toward the most abundant proteins/peptides (19Ludwig C. Gillet L. Rosenberger G. Amon S. Collins B.C. Aebersold R. Data-independent acquisition-based SWATH-MS for quantitative proteomics: a tutorial.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2018; 14 (30104418): e812610.15252/msb.20178126Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, quantification of peptides from DIA data must be accomplished by comparison of LC retention times and mass spectra with an independently established reference library (20Searle B.C. Pino L.K. Egertson J.D. Ting Y.S. Lawrence R.T. MacLean B.X. Villén J. MacCoss M.J. Chromatogram libraries improve peptide detection and quantification by data independent acquisition mass spectrometry.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9 (30510204): 512810.1038/s41467-018-07454-wCrossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To faithfully and accurately evaluate the DIA data, we generated comprehensive spectral libraries by subjecting a fourth replicate of each time point to off-line, basic-pH HPLC-C18 fractionation (21Batth T.S. Francavilla C. Olsen J.V. Off-line high-pH reversed-phase fractionation for in-depth phosphoproteomics.J. Proteome Res. 2014; 13 (25338131): 6176-618610.1021/pr500893mCrossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A total of 42 fractions (7 time points × 6 fractions) for both tryptic peptides and enriched phosphopeptides were analyzed by data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS, and the results were combined into two distinct libraries containing the spectral and chromatographic information for 115,093 peptides (derived from 8,164 proteins) for the analysis of the global proteome data and 30,586 phosphopeptides (derived from 4,831 proteins) for the analysis of the phosphoproteome data. By interrogating our DIA data with these comprehensive spectral libraries using Spectronaut 10 (Biognosys), we were able to obtain quantitative information for 7,696 proteins (Table S1) and 19,931 phosphosites falling below a false discovery rate (q value) cut-off of 1% in at least one of the 21 samples (7 time points × 3 replicates; Table S2). However, to increase the confidence and stringency of the phosphoproteomics interpretation, we restricted all subsequent analyses to the 11,847 phosphopeptides that were quantified in at least 15 of the 21 samples (i.e. for which a maximum of six values had to be imputed). The associated coefficients of variation were observed to be around 10 and 25% for the proteome and phosphoproteome analysis, respectively, which demonstrates high quantitative precision and low variability between the biological replicates of each time point (Fig. S1). Differential expression analysis using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test revealed that the measured levels of 738 phosphosites (located on 466 proteins) and 202 proteins showed significant changes (i.e. were significantly regulated) within 60 min of CCR2 activation by CCL2 (adjusted p value <0.05; Tables S1 and S2). Importantly, only 5% of the significantly regulated phosphosites are located on proteins whose expression levels were observed to change, confirming that the majority of the observed changes in the phosphoproteome are not driven by changes in protein expression. Moreover, differential expression analyses showed that, compared with the phosphosites, the expression levels of proteins generally did not change until 60 min after CCL2 treatment, which is in agreement with the expectation that alterations in protein expression levels are much slower than changes in phosphorylation patterns (Fig. 2, A–F). Nevertheless, phosphopeptides on significantly regulated proteins were removed from further analysis, which reduced the number of significantly regulated phosphosites to 699 (located on 441 proteins). A principal component analysis based on these 699 high-confidence phosphopeptides (Fig. 2G) revealed a time-dependent clustering pattern, which highlights the profound and rapid changes occurring in the phosphoproteome even after a short time of CCL2 exposure (1.5–3 min). These changes then gradually reversed over time to approach the untreated steady-state equilibrium after 60 min. To understand the biological pathways and signal transduction networks affected by CCR2 activation, we subjected the 441 proteins that carry the 699 significantly regulated phosphosites to gene ontology analyses and to enrichment analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways, using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (22Huang da W. Sherman B.T. Lempicki R.A. Systematic and integrative analysis of large gene lists using DAVID bioinformatics resources.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4 (19131956): 44-5710.1038/nprot.2008.211Crossref PubMed Scopus (23101) Google Scholar) (Table S3). As discussed below, these analyses revealed that there is a prevalence of regulated protein phosphorylation in a number of pathways known to be involved in chemokine signaling but also highlighted some groups of proteins not usually associated with chemokine receptor activation. As expected, our set of regulated phosphoproteins is enriched for proteins in several signal transduction pathways known to be activated upon CCR2 (or other chemokine receptor) stimulation. These include the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway, and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway (23Biswas S.K.

The enrichment of proteins in these pathways provides some internal validation for the accuracy of the phosphoproteomics data. However, as a means to independently validate our data set, we also sought to detect some of these phosphorylation changes using Western blotting, although such experiments were limited by the scarcity (and often questionable quality) of commercially available antibodies recognizing distinct phosphorylation sites. One of the hallmarks of chemokine activation is the phosphorylation of the two MAPK/ERK isoforms (MAPK1 and MAPK3). As shown in Fig. 3, Western blotting data are in excellent agreement with the quantitative proteomics (DIA) data, both convincingly demonstrating that MAPK1 and MAPK3 are rapidly phosphorylated upon CCR2 activation, peaking at 1.5–3 min after stimulation and then returning to baseline levels by 6–12 min after stimulation (Fig. 3, A–D and F). Also, as expected, DIA data indicated that phosphorylation of c-JUN, a downstream target of MAPK1/3 (26Werle M. Schmal U. Hanna K. Kreuzer J. MCP-1 induces activation of MAP-kinases ERK, JNK and p38 MAPK in human endothelial cells.Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 56 (12393099): 284-29210.1016/S0008-6363(02)00600-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), peaks shortly after maximum ERK-1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3E). As a first step toward validation of our observations in monocytes, we have used Western blotting to quantify phosphorylation of several proteins (MAPK1/3, JUN, STAT3, and RPS6KA1) in THP-1 cells, an immortalized monocyte cell line that endogenously expresses CCR2. We observed good agreement between the time courses of phosphorylation in THP-1 cells and the time courses observed for the same phosphorylation sites in our DIA phosphoproteomics data set (Fig. S2). The regulated phosphoproteome was highly enriched in proteins involved in the formation of the actin cytoskeleton, cytoskeletal (re)organization, and cytoskeleton-related functions such as cell adhesion or endocytosis (Table S4). Because chemokines regulate cell migration and adhesion, these observations help to further validate the phosphoproteomics data set. Moreover, the reorganization of actin filaments is known to be controlled by the Ras family GTPases RHO, RAC, and CDC42. Although we did not directly observe phosphorylation of these proteins, we found that phosphorylation was regulated for a number of associated proteins. For example, we observed five significantly regulated phosphorylation sites in the Ras GTPase-activating protein nGAP (RASAL2), all showing similar time courses of early (1.5–6-min) decreases in phosphorylation before returning to baseline (Fig. 4, A–E). In addition, we observed significantly regulated phosphorylation for numerous guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs), which are positive and negative modulators, respectively, of GTPase activity (Fig. 4 (F–J) and Fig. S3). In addition to the above effects of chemokine receptor activation, we also observed phosphorylation (or dephosphorylation) for many proteins that exert functions in the nucleus, including DNA replication and repair, transcriptional regulation, RNA processing, and cell cycle regulation. Related to these, the set of regulated phosphoproteins was highly enriched in components of the nuclear pore complex and other proteins involved in nuclear export (Table S4). Among these, nuclear pore proteins NUP153 and TPR had six and four significantly regulated phosphosites, respectively (Fig. 5, A–E). In addition, whereas some of the regulated nuclear proteins underwent relatively fast changes in phosphorylation (within ∼6 min), others showed substantially slower kinetics and/or remained significantly different from baseline after 25 or 60 min (Fig. 5 and Fig. S4). To our knowledge, the regulation of nuclear protein phosphorylation after activation of CCR2 (or other chemokine receptors) has not been previously studied in detail. Its potential significance is discussed below. To provide further insights into the signaling pathways resulting from CCR2 activation, we have generated a network of interconnected proteins whose phosphorylation status changes between any of the measured time points (Fig. 6). This network was assembled in several steps. First, the enriched KEGG pathways were connected with each other and with known CCR2 proximal signaling events. Second, we added regulated phosphoproteins that were identified by interrogation of the STRING protein-protein interaction database to have at least three connections to members of the initial network; many of these were also connected to each other. Subsequently, the network was manually curated and organized to indicate the functional clusters discussed above. To assist in illustrating the temporal dynamics of phosphorylation across this network, we classified all 699 regulated phosphosites into three groups (fast, medium, and slow responders) based on the time when the changes reached their maximal amplitudes compared with the baseline control (colored circles in Fig. 6; see Table S2). The majority of the phosphosites (74%) reached their maximal amplitude within 3 min (fast responders), 20% showed maximal changes after 6–12 min (medium responders), and only a very small proportion (7%) reached maximal changes after 25–60 min. Fast, medium, and slow responders were fairly evenly distributed throughout the network without any apparent spatial-temporal pattern, and some proteins even carry multiple phosphosites that reach their maximal (de)phosphorylation levels after substantially different time periods; examples include transcription factor NFκB1, pleiotropic Ser/Thr kinase PRKD1, and cell adhesion–associated kinase EPHA2 (Fig. 6). These observations accentuate the complexity of the CCR2 signal transduction network. Signaling via pro-inflammatory chemokine receptors is critical for the stimulation of leukocyte migration in numerous inflammatory diseases. However, most studies of chemokine receptor signal transduction have focused on detection of well-characterized pathways and effectors (e.g. activated G proteins, cAMP levels, phosphorylated MAPK1/3, Ca2+ mobilization, and β-arrestin recruitment) or cellular properties (e.g. chemotaxis and proliferation) as readouts for receptor activation. A smaller number of studies have investigated specific features of the pathways that connect receptor activation to cellular outcomes (27Singh N.K. Janjanam J. Rao G.N. p115 RhoGEF activates the Rac1 GTPase signaling cascade in MCP1 chemokine-induced vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation.J. Biol.

In this study, to gain new insights into the mechanisms of CCR2-activated signal transduction, we have taken the unbiased phosphoproteomics approach to identify numerous phosphorylation (and dephosphorylation) events resulting from CCR2 activation. This approach has the potential to corroborate prior observations as well as reveal new aspects of the CCR2 signaling network. Nonetheless, although the discovery proteomics approach used here provides valuable insights into the dynamics of CCL2-stimulated phosphorylation events, it should be noted that any information regarding the subcellular localization of these signaling events is lacking. This will be an area of interest for future investigation. We identified nearly 700 phosphopeptides that are significantly regulated in response to CCR2 activation. In addition to well-known signal transduction pathways, our data clearly demonstrate that CCR2 activation substantially affects actin-, GTP-, and nuclear-related proteins. Importantly, a significant proportion of these identified phosphopeptides have not previously been linked to chemokine signaling, and some may be viable targets to interfere with or disrupt chemokine signaling. It is noteworthy that we observed phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) f"

https://openalex.org/W3015022705,"Multimodal signaling is nearly ubiquitous across animal taxa. While much research has focused on male signal production contributing to female mate-choice or preferences, females often give their own multimodal signals during intersexual communication events. Multimodal signal components are often classified based on whether they contain redundant information (e.g., the backup hypothesis) or non-redundant information (e.g., the multiple messages hypothesis) from the perspective of the receiver. We investigated the role of two different female vocalizations produced by the female house mouse (Mus musculus): the broadband, relatively low-frequency squeaks (broadband vocalizations or BBVs,), and the higher-frequency ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs). These female vocalizations may convey differently valenced information to the male receivers. We paired these vocalizations with and without female urine to examine the influence of combining information across multiple modalities. We found evidence that female urine and vocalizations act as non-redundant multimodal cues as males responded with different behaviors and vocalization rates depending on the female signal presented. Additionally, male mice responded with greater courtship effort to the multimodal combination of female USVs paired with female urine than any other signal combination. These results suggest that the olfactory information contained in female urine provides the context by which males can then evaluate potentially ambiguous female vocalizations."
https://openalex.org/W3015078094,"The DOCK-D (dedicator of cytokinesis D) family proteins are atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factors that regulate Rho GTPase activity. The family consists of Zizimin1 (DOCK9), Zizimin2 (DOCK11), and Zizimin3 (DOCK10). Functions of the DOCK-D family proteins are presently not well-explored, and the role of the DOCK-D family in neuroinflammation is unknown. In this study, we generated three mouse lines in which DOCK9 (DOCK9−/−), DOCK10 (DOCK10−/−), or DOCK11 (DOCK11−/−) had been deleted and examined the phenotypic effects of these gene deletions in MOG35–55 peptide-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of the neuroinflammatory disorder multiple sclerosis. We found that all the gene knockout lines were healthy and viable. The only phenotype observed under normal conditions was a slightly smaller proportion of B cells in splenocytes in DOCK10−/− mice than in the other mouse lines. We also found that the migration ability of macrophages is impaired in DOCK10−/− and DOCK11−/− mice and that the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was ameliorated only in DOCK10−/− mice. No apparent phenotype was observed for DOCK9−/− mice. Further investigations indicated that lipopolysaccharide stimulation up-regulates DOCK10 expression in microglia and that microglial migration is decreased in DOCK10−/− mice. Up-regulation of C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) expression induced by activation of Toll-like receptor 4 or 9 signaling was reduced in DOCK10−/− astrocytes compared with WT astrocytes. Taken together, our findings suggest that DOCK10 plays a role in innate immunity and neuroinflammation and might represent a potential therapeutic target for managing multiple sclerosis. The DOCK-D (dedicator of cytokinesis D) family proteins are atypical guanine nucleotide exchange factors that regulate Rho GTPase activity. The family consists of Zizimin1 (DOCK9), Zizimin2 (DOCK11), and Zizimin3 (DOCK10). Functions of the DOCK-D family proteins are presently not well-explored, and the role of the DOCK-D family in neuroinflammation is unknown. In this study, we generated three mouse lines in which DOCK9 (DOCK9−/−), DOCK10 (DOCK10−/−), or DOCK11 (DOCK11−/−) had been deleted and examined the phenotypic effects of these gene deletions in MOG35–55 peptide-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of the neuroinflammatory disorder multiple sclerosis. We found that all the gene knockout lines were healthy and viable. The only phenotype observed under normal conditions was a slightly smaller proportion of B cells in splenocytes in DOCK10−/− mice than in the other mouse lines. We also found that the migration ability of macrophages is impaired in DOCK10−/− and DOCK11−/− mice and that the severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was ameliorated only in DOCK10−/− mice. No apparent phenotype was observed for DOCK9−/− mice. Further investigations indicated that lipopolysaccharide stimulation up-regulates DOCK10 expression in microglia and that microglial migration is decreased in DOCK10−/− mice. Up-regulation of C–C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) expression induced by activation of Toll-like receptor 4 or 9 signaling was reduced in DOCK10−/− astrocytes compared with WT astrocytes. Taken together, our findings suggest that DOCK10 plays a role in innate immunity and neuroinflammation and might represent a potential therapeutic target for managing multiple sclerosis."

The paper built the unsafe driving behavior model of online car-hailing drivers based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), explored the socio-psychological factors underlying drivers’ motivation for unsafe driving behavior and examined how these factors predict their behaviors. 239 online car-hailing drivers were surveyed with a self-reported questionnaire. Factors analysis proved the TPB questionnaire to be valid and reliable. Structural equation modeling showed that attitude to behavior (0.18), subjective norm(0.39) significantly influenced drivers' behavioral intention, perceived behavioral control (0.27) could both affected drivers' behavioral intention (0.27) and behavior(0.21),behavioral intention was the most direct and important predictor of behavior.

We investigated the impacts of anesthesia of neonatal (7–8 days old) and adult (2–3 months old) mice with the inhalational anesthetics 2.5% sevoflurane or 1.5% isoflurane, or the injectable anesthetics propofol (150 mg/kg) or avertin (375 mg/kg), for up to 6 hours. We found that sevoflurane and isoflurane induced severe hypoglycemia in neonatal mice and that this phenomenon was specific to the inhalational anesthetics because the injectable anesthetics propofol and avertin did not induce hypoglycemia. Surprisingly, the inhalational anesthesia induced hyperglycemia instead in adult mice. We also demonstrated that the inhalational anesthesia-induced hypoglycemia was a major cause of death for the neonatal mice receiving intranasal administration of saline prior to anesthesia. These studies revealed severe hypoglycemia in neonatal mice during anesthesia with sevoflurane or isoflurane. If this phenomenon also occurs in human, our findings would warrant closely monitoring blood glucose level and maintaining it in the normal range in infants receiving inhalational anesthesia."

This difficult-to-fold protein is susceptible to structural alterations that disable export of the misfolded thyroglobulin from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which is a known cause of congenital hypothyroidism characterized by severe chronic thyrocyte ER stress. Nevertheless, individuals with this disease commonly grow a goiter, indicating thyroid cell survival and adaptation. To model these processes, here we continuously exposed rat PCCL3 thyrocytes to tunicamycin, which causes a significant degree of ER stress that is specifically attributable to thyroglobulin misfolding. We found that, in response, PCCL3 cells down-regulate expression of the “tunicamycin transporter” (major facilitator superfamily domain containing-2A, Mfsd2a). Following CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Mfsd2a deletion, PCCL3 cells could no longer escape the chronic effects of high-dose tunicamycin, as demonstrated by persistent accumulation of unglycosylated thyroglobulin; nevertheless, these thyrocytes survived and grew. A proteomic analysis of these cells adapted to chronic ER protein misfolding revealed many hundreds of up-regulated proteins, indicating stimulation of ER chaperones, oxidoreductases, stress responses, and lipid biosynthesis pathways. Further, we noted increased phospho–AMP-kinase, suggesting up-regulated AMP-kinase activity, and decreased phospho–S6-kinase and protein translation, suggesting decreased mTOR activity. These changes are consistent with conserved cell survival/adaptation pathways. We also observed a less-differentiated thyrocyte phenotype with decreased PAX8, FOXE1, and TPO protein levels, along with decreased thyroglobulin mRNA levels.

Protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumTgthyroglobulinTSHthyrotropinTUNtunicamycinROSreactive oxygen speciesphospho-AMPKphosphorylated AMP kinase. is continuously monitored through ER stress sensing and signaling pathways. Activation of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, collectively, transmits responses that lead to inhibition of global protein synthesis while increasing ER chaperones and protein folding factors, accompanied by increased ER-associated and autophagic degradation of misfolded proteins (1Han J. Kaufman R.J. Physiological/pathological ramifications of transcription factors in the unfolded protein response.Genes Dev. 2017; 31 (28860159): 1417-143810.1101/gad.297374.117Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

When cell proliferation is insufficient to compensate for cell loss, functional tissue mass may decline, as has been postulated in the case of pancreatic β-cell failure in several forms of diabetes (5Oakes S.A.

Conversely, when the stimulation of cell growth outpaces cell loss, there is actual net tissue expansion, as in the development of thyroid goiter in several forms of thyroid dyshormonogenesis (6Targovnik H.M.

ER stress–mediated disease may take months or years to become clinically apparent, which poses a significant challenge when trying to correlate experimental ER stress studies that are often conducted on a short time scale (7Ryoo H.D.

Thyroglobulin (Tg) misfolding as a cause of congenital hypothyroidism represents a valuable system in which to explore cell death or survival in the face of chronic ER stress. The defect within the ER is severe (8Medeiros-Neto G. Kim P.S. Yoo S.E. Vono J. Targovnik H.M. Camargo R. Hossain S.A. Arvan P. Congenital hypothyroid goiter with deficient thyroglobulin. Identification of an endoplasmic reticulum storage disease (ERSD) with induction of molecular chaperones.J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98 (8981932): 2838-284410.1172/JCI119112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet (unlike deleterious effects of chronic hyperglycemia on pancreatic β-cells) hypothyroidism itself is nontoxic to thyrocytes. TG is the most highly expressed thyroid gene. The Tg protein comprises >50% of all thyroidal protein, and its export through the secretory pathway is required for thyroid hormone synthesis (9Di Jeso B. Arvan P. Thyroglobulin from molecular and cellular biology to clinical endocrinology.Endocr. Rev. 2016; 37 (26595189): 2-3610.1210/er.2015-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Most pathogenic Tg mutants are misfolded and entrapped in the ER, causing chronic ER stress with hypothyroidism (10Citterio C.E. Targovnik H.M. Arvan P. The role of thyroglobulin in thyroid hormonogenesis.Nat. Rev. Endocrinol. 2019; 15 (30886364): 323-33810.1038/s41574-019-0184-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which triggers a well-understood endocrine feedback loop that increases circulating thyrotropin (TSH) that is linked to thyrocyte proliferation, promoting thyroid gland growth in humans and animal models. Yet, many studies suggest that cell death with loss of tissue mass is the expected consequence of chronic unremitting ER stress (3Ghosh R. Colon-Negron K. Papa F.R. Endoplasmic reticulum stress, degeneration of pancreatic islet β-cells, and therapeutic modulation of the unfolded protein response in diabetes.Mol.

Until now there have been few or no studies examining how thyrocytes with massive misfolding of Tg in the ER can avoid loss of thyroid cell mass. In this report we have developed a cell culture model of PCCL3 thyrocytes surviving and growing in the face of chronic continuous ER stress with accumulation of misfolded Tg. Importantly, TSH is not a variable in our cell culture studies and plays no direct role in the adaptive response to chronic ER stress in this model. With this in mind, we find that PCCL3 cells surviving chronic unremitting ER stress have fairly dramatic changes in the whole cell proteome, suggesting persistently up-regulated ER stress responses including the pro-apoptotic transcription factor, CHOP, plus ER lipid biosynthetic activity, activated AMP-kinase, increased autophagy, and a suggestion of down-regulated mTOR signaling and global protein synthesis, and subtle signs of thyrocyte de-differentiation accompanying significantly decreased TG mRNA levels. With these global changes, remarkably, thyrocytes continue to grow both in our cell culture model and, we show, in vivo as well. Patients suffering from congenital hypothyroidism with defective thyroglobulin often develop thyroid gland overgrowth (goiter) (12Medeiros-Neto G. Targovnik H.M. Vassart G. Defective thyroglobulin synthesis and secretion causing goiter and hypothyroidism.Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14 (8325250): 165-18310.1210/edrv-14-2-165PubMed Google Scholar). This has also been found in some animal models of the disease (13Kim P.S. Hossain S.A. Park Y.N. Lee I. Yoo S.E. Arvan P. A single amino acid change in the acetylcholinesterase-like domain of thyroglobulin causes congenital goiter with hypothyroidism in the cog/cog mouse: A model of human endoplasmic reticulum storage diseases.Proc.

The homozygous TGcog/cog mouse encodes expression of misfolded Tg that is defective for export from the ER, triggering chronic continuous ER stress in the thyroid gland from neonatal life through adulthood (14Kim P.S. Kwon O.-Y. Arvan P. An endoplasmic reticulum storage disease causing congenital goiter with hypothyroidism.J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133 (8636228): 517-52710.1083/jcb.133.3.517Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Despite this, we confirmed ongoing thyroid follicular epithelial cell (thyrocyte) proliferation (as measured by Ki67 immunocytochemistry) (Fig. S1). Thus, thyrocytes can indeed survive and adapt to chronic, continuous ER stress. We therefore wondered if it was possible to develop a simple cell culture model of thyrocyte adaptation to chronic ER stress with thyroglobulin misfolding. Thyrocytes are dedicated to the biosynthesis of the Tg glycoprotein (15Di Jeso B. Ulianich L. Pacifico F. Leonardi A. Vito P. Consiglio E. Formisano S. Arvan P. The folding of thyroglobulin in the calnexin/calreticulin pathway and its alteration by a loss of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochem. J. 2003; 370 (12401114): 449-45810.1042/bj20021257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which ordinarily accounts for more than half of all of the protein of the thyroid gland (16Van Herle A.J. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Control of thyroglobulin synthesis and secretion. Part one.N. Eng. J. Med. 1979; 301 (221813): 239-24910.1056/NEJM197908023010504Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). With this in mind, we examined ER stress response upon CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of TG in PCCL3 thyrocyte clones with undetectable Tg synthesis (TG-KO) (Fig. 1, A and B). TG-KO clones showed a ≥30% decrease in basal levels of BiP mRNA (Fig. 1C); additionally, tunicamycin (TUN) treatment induced BiP and CHOP mRNA by only ∼half that obtained from treatment of control thyrocytes (Fig. 1, D and E). After 48 h with 25 ng/ml TUN treatment of control PCCL3 cells (that express Tg protein), misfolded Tg could be visually seen to accumulate in the ER, accompanied by stress-induced up-regulation of ER resident proteins (Fig. 1, G and H). Even with an acute challenge of 100 ng/ml TUN, a majority of thyrocytes survived at 48 h (i.e. 39% dead) with significantly greater survival in TG-KO cells (Fig. 1F). Altogether, these data suggest that expression of the endogenous Tg glycoprotein contributes significantly to basal ER stress in thyrocytes with an even greater contribution to ER stress induced by TUN treatment. Based on the foregoing results, we sought to explore the behavior of chronically ER-stressed PCCL3 cells maintained in the continuous presence of TUN, with persistent Tg misfolding. After a 7-d exposure to 25 ng/ml TUN, ER stress was still apparent as detected by increased phospho-eIF2α; however, by ∼2 months of continuous culture, the increased level of phospho-eIF2α significantly abated (Fig. 2A). To determine whether this represents adaptation to chronic ER stress or escape from the effects of TUN, we followed the glycosylation of endogenous Tg throughout the experimental time course. After 7 d of TUN, >90% of intracellular Tg was unglycosylated (Fig. 2B, upper panel), and essentially no Tg was secreted into the medium (lower panel). However, by 2 weeks after initiation of TUN treatment we noted the beginning of a return of Tg secretion, and by ∼ 1 month of treatment there was a notable decline in intracellular unglycosylated Tg accompanied by an increase of Tg glycosylation and secretion (Fig. 2B). Recognizing this, we conducted experiments in which cells escaping the effects of low-dose TUN were challenged with successively higher doses. After each increment of TUN concentration, PCCL3 cells accumulated unglycosylated Tg intracellularly and secreted almost no Tg into the media, but in each case, thyrocytes eventually lost the inhibition of N-glycosylation by TUN (Fig. 2C). With each dose increase, thyrocytes initially slowed their growth rate but then returned to the same passage frequency as that of control cells. Thyrocytes successively exposed to increasing doses of TUN developed obvious swelling of the ER, as judged by EM (Fig. 2D). Given the obvious escape from inhibition of N-glycosylation, we examined expression of the lysophosphatidylcholine/docosahexaenoate transporter Mfsd2a, which is known to encode the primary plasmalemmal transport mechanism for TUN (17Reiling J.H. Clish C.B. Carette J.E. Varadarajan M. Brummelkamp T.R. Sabatini D.M. A haploid genetic screen identifies the major facilitator domain containing 2A (MFSD2A) transporter as a key mediator in the response to tunicamycin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Yoshioka M. Inoue A. Komatsu H. Nishitoh H. Kataoka H. Nunoi H. A mouse model reveals that Mfsd2a is critical for unfolded protein response upon exposure to tunicamycin.Hum. Cell. 2017; 30 (27885588): 88-9710.1007/s13577-016-0153-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Indeed, PCCL3 cells that had been slowly adapted to increasing doses of TUN eventually suppressed Mfsd2a mRNA expression >500-fold (Fig. 2E). Compatible with successive escape from inhibition of N-glycosylation by TUN, we noted that with each stepwise dose increment, ER stress response was activated followed by subsequent recovery, as measured by a restoration of BiP and CHOP mRNA toward initial, control levels (Fig. 2F). However, we noted that at the highest dose of TUN achieved by stepwise increment (300 ng/ml), the cells' defect in N-glycosylation of Tg persisted for the duration of our experiments, indicating that it is possible with high dose TUN to inhibit N-glycosylation despite a profound loss of Mfsd2a expression. At this highest dose, similar to the lower doses, after an initial slowing of growth rate the cells resumed a passage frequency identical to that of untreated control cells (although at this point, the cells had been growing in sequential culture for more than 1 year). Because PCCL3 cells repeatedly escaped effects of sequential TUN until 1 year in culture by down-regulating Mfsd2a expression, we reasoned that cells bearing genetic deficiency of Mfsd2a (while being resistant to low-dose TUN) would be immediately sensitive to high-dose TUN yet, under these conditions, would be defective for escape from the inhibition of N-glycosylation. With this in mind, we used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of Mfsd2a in PCCL3 thyrocyte clones with confirmation of frameshift (Mfsd2a-KO). Two PCCL3 clones exhibited identical phenotypes (e.g. Fig. S3); most of the experiments shown in this study used clone A5. When challenged with a range of TUN doses for 24 h, control PCCL3 cells already showed a dramatic activation of ER stress response at a dose of 0.1 μg/ml TUN (as measured by the ratio of spliced to unspliced XBP1 that depends upon Ire1) (19Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. XBP1 mRNA is induced by ATF6 and spliced by IRE1 in response to ER stress to produce a highly active transcription factor.Cell. 2001; 107 (11779464): 881-89110.1016/S0092-8674(01)00611-0Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar), whereas homozygous Mfsd2a-KO cells yielded similar ER stress only after an order of magnitude increase in TUN concentration (Fig. 3A, left). Consistent with these findings, control PCCL3 cells exhibited a similar TUN dose sensitivity for increased eIF2α phosphorylation (suggestive of PERK activation) (20Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Ron D. Protein translation and folding are coupled by an endoplasmic-reticulum-resident kinase.Nature. 1999; 397 (9930704): 271-27410.1038/16729Crossref PubMed Scopus (2403) Google Scholar), as well an increase in the steady-state levels of BiP and CHOP (Fig. 3B), two well-recognized targets of the ER stress response (21Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Regulated translation initiation controls stress-induced gene expression in mammalian cells.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6 (11106749): 1099-110810.1016/S1097-2765(00)00108-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar). Further, whereas low-dose TUN nearly completely blocked Tg secretion from control PCCL3 cells, a comparable block of Tg secretion from Mfsd2a-KO cells also required an order of magnitude higher TUN concentration (Fig. 3C, left). Similarly, although thyrocytes must generate ROS (in the form of H2O2) for thyroid hormone synthesis, Mfsd2a-KO cells exhibited less TUN-induced ROS as judged either by dihydroethidium fluorescence imaging (Fig. S2) or as quantified by dihydrorhodamine 123 fluorescence (Fig. 3D). The Mfsd2a-KO cells required more than or equal to an order of magnitude increase in TUN dose to trigger a comparable degree of acute ER stress–induced cell death (Fig. 3E and Fig. S3). By contrast, sensitivity of both sets of thyrocytes to another ER stress inducer (thapsigargin, 250 nm, 24 h) were comparable as judged by XBP1 splicing (Fig. 3A, right), with a similar inhibition of Tg secretion (sampled at 24–72 h) (Fig. 3C, right). Thus, Mfsd2a-KO thyrocytes are resistant to low-dose TUN but they are not defective in sensitivity to ER stress. As noted above, we predicted that Mfsd2a-KO thyrocytes would be relatively incapable of escape from inhibition of N-glycosylation in the persistent presence of high-dose TUN. Indeed, even after a continuous 4-month exposure to TUN at a dose of 1500 ng/ml, Tg contained within the Mfsd2a-KO cells remained unglycosylated (Fig. 4A, U) and could not be secreted into the medium (Fig. S4). Over this lengthy period of continuous culture, BiP mRNA remained elevated (Fig. 4B), accompanied by an increase of KDEL-containing ER-resident proteins including BiP, GRP94, and others (as measured by Western blotting (Fig. 4C). Moreover, Mfsd2a-KO thyrocytes grown in the continuous presence of 1500 ng/ml TUN exhibited persistently increased phospho-eIF2α (not shown) accompanied by increased CHOP levels (Fig. 4C). Despite this, the chronic continuously ER-stressed thyrocytes exhibited an overall cell growth rate that was not significantly different from that of the same cells grown in the complete absence of TUN (Fig. 4D). These adapted thyrocytes reproducibly exhibited an increase of phospho-AMP-kinase (our antibody recognizes phospho–Thr-172 of the AMPK α-subunit). To evaluate if this represents part of the physiological adaptive response of thyrocytes to chronic continuous ER stress, we analyzed thyroid gland tissue of TGcog/TGcog mice (homozygously expressing the misfolded mutant Tg-L2263P) and indeed observed very similar behavior (Fig. 5B). Thus, an increase in the pro-apoptotic transcription factor CHOP in the face of chronic continuous ER stress does not preclude extensive overall cell proliferation (Fig. 4D and Fig. S1) which underlies goiter development (22Adkison L.R. Taylor S. Beamer W.G. Mutant gene-induced disorders of structure, function and thyroglobulin synthesis in congenital goitre (cog/cog) in mice.J. Endocrinol. 1990; 126 (1696305): 51-5810.1677/joe.0.1260051Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Moreover, we considered the possibility that the activation of AMPK helps to limit ER stress–mediated cell death; indeed, we observed that addition of the AMPK chemical activator 769662 significantly decreased cell death of “virgin PCCL3” thyrocytes in response to an acute ER stress challenge with high-dose TUN (Fig. 5C). Accompanying the activation of AMPK was a notable decrease in the extent of phosphorylation of ribosomal S6-kinase (Fig. 5D), which is a known downstream target of the mTOR signaling cascade and a contributing regulator of protein synthesis capacity (23Hay N. Sonenberg N. Upstream and downstream of mTOR.Genes Dev. 2004; 18 (15314020): 1926-194510.1101/gad.1212704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3331) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the growth rate of the chronically adapted thyrocytes was essentially normal (Fig. 4D), and the cells simultaneously maintained a lower overall protein synthesis rate (established by amino acid radiolabeling, Fig. 5E). We performed a comprehensive proteomic analysis of up- and down-regulated proteins in three independent replicate cultures of chronically ER-stressed thyrocytes. Remarkably, there was very low variability between the replicates, indicating low biological heterogeneity plus low variance in sample preparation and protein separation, leading to excellent quantitative correlation between samples. The majority of detected changes in protein content represented proteins up-regulated in chronically ER-stressed cells (Table S1). From software-enabled Gene Ontology analysis proteins involved in signaling pathways, gene regulatory pathways, and metabolic pathways, we were able to deduce the major up-regulated biological pathways in the Mfsd2a-KO thyrocytes chronically stressed by continuous high-dose TUN exposure (Fig. 6). Of more than 4000 total protein identifications, <10% showed a significant increase in concentration, with a tendency to fall into pathways linked to tRNA synthetase activity (coupled to ATF4 function), nucleotide/ATP binding (coupled to chaperone function), and ER homeostasis (Fig. 6 and Table S2). Only a minority of the highly up-regulated pathways in the continuous TUN-treated cells were plausibly correlated to functional inhibition of N-glycosylation, focused primarily on increased basal lamina/extracellular matrix proteins required for cell-cell or cell-matrix attachment. Additionally, other novel pathways were up-regulated in cells adapted to these chronic stress conditions (Fig. 6). Of the fewer down-regulated proteins, we noted subtle signs of thyrocyte de-differentiation, including a decrease of thyroid transcription factors FOXE1 and PAX8, as well as decreased thyroid peroxidase (TPO) protein expression (Fig. 7A). Because misfolded Tg accumulates intracellularly (within the ER) (Figs. 4A and 5A and Fig. S4), its intracellular protein level is not a good means to look for altered protein expression/de-differentiation.

No general principles have emerged to explain SAM domain function, and whether individual SAM domains can substitute for others is unknown. Thus, we devised a genetic complementation system with Samd14 and mutant chimeric proteins in which the Samd14 SAM domain was replaced with SAM domains from other SAM domain proteins. Guided by insights derived from structural prediction tools, we conducted structure/function analyses. Our results demonstrate that the Samd14 SAM domain promotes c-Kit–mediated cellular signaling to regulate progenitor function, and this SAM domain has functional attributes unique from those of structurally-related SAM domains.

Loss of the Samd14-enhancer (Samd14–Enh) prevented anemia-induced Samd14 expression in spleen and attenuated c-Kit signaling in erythroid progenitors (Fig. 1A).

Ex vivo, Samd14–Enh−/− erythroid progenitors (CD71+Ter119−Kit+) exhibited 2.1- and 1.6-fold lower phospho (serine 473) AKT (pAKT) versus WT in response to 5 or 10 min of SCF treatment, respectively (Fig. 1B). To determine whether reduced c-Kit signaling resulting from Samd14 down-regulation is reversible, we developed a genetic complementation assay involving restoration of Samd14 expression in Samd14–Enh−/− splenic progenitors isolated from anemic mice (Fig. 1C). Lin− progenitors were isolated from the spleens of mice treated with the erythrocyte-lysing and anemia-inducing chemical phenylhydrazine (PHZ) for 3 days. Retroviral expression of HA-tagged Samd14 (HA–Samd14) increased Samd14 protein levels relative to empty vector (EV) controls (Fig. 1D). Consistent with prior studies (4Hewitt K.J. Katsumura K.R.

After 72 h under culture conditions that favor erythroid precursor proliferation, cultures were treated with SCF for up to 20 min, and a phospho-flow cytometry assay was used to quantify signaling pathway activation in infected GFP+CD71+Kit+ cells (Fig. 1E). After 5 min of SCF treatment, pAKT levels were 1.8-fold higher (p = 0.003) in Samd14–Enh−/− cells expressing HA–Samd14 compared with EV controls (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1). As the SCF/c-Kit signaling defect in Samd14–Enh−/− splenic progenitors was rescued by restoring physiological levels of Samd14, the defect results from insufficient Samd14 expression. Erythroid differentiation of lineage-depleted splenic progenitors from PHZ-treated animals was monitored using CD71 and Ter119 surface markers. The percentage of infected cells in each experiment is shown in Table S1. Early erythroid precursors reside in R1 (CD71low, Ter119−) and R2 (CD71high, Ter119−) compartments, with progressively differentiating erythroblasts in R3 (CD71high, Ter119+), R4 (CD71med, Ter119+), and R5 (CD71low, Ter119+) (Fig. 2A). When quantitated, there were no differences in cellularity between WT and Samd14–Enh−/− cells after 3 days of culture (Fig. 2B). Giemsa staining confirmed the similar morphologies of EV- and Samd14-infected cells (Fig. 2C). However, Samd14 expression increased the percentage of CD71+Ter119+c-Kit+ cells relative to EV cells (Fig. 2D). Whereas the overall percentage of c-Kit+ cells in the HA–Samd14-infected cell population did not change, CD71+Ter119+ cells within the c-Kit+ population increased 2.0 ± 0.1-fold (p = 0.002) (Fig. 2E). Thus, restoring Samd14 expression in Samd14–Enh−/− spleen erythroid progenitors increased the percentage of CD71+Ter119+Kit+ cells without impacting overall erythroid maturation. Samd14 is predicted to harbor a SAM domain from amino acid residues 323–390 of unknown function (Fig. 3A). Human SAMD14 shares 94% protein identity with murine Samd14, and both proteins contain a 68-amino acid C-terminal SAM domain. The Samd14 SAM domain is evolutionarily conserved in many vertebrate species, with only three residues varying between humans and mice (Fig. 3B). SAM domains can mediate protein self-association, interaction with other proteins, or lipids or RNA binding (24Qiao F. Bowie J.U. The many faces of SAM.Sci.

However, principles governing SAM domain function are not established, and one cannot predict whether a given SAM domain is essential, modulatory, or functionally insignificant.

To identify potentially important structural features of the Samd14 SAM domain, we utilized in silico homology modeling using known NMR-derived protein structures. Samd14–SAM was predicted to have five α-helices that align with other SAM proteins (35Tröster A. Heinzlmeir S. Berger B.T. Gande S.L. Saxena K. Sreeramulu S. Linhard V. Nasiri A.H. Bolte M. Müller S.

Sequence similarity of the Samd14 SAM domain with other SAM domains varied from 57% identity with Neurabin-1 (Neb1) SAM to 20% with SHIP-2 SAM. To determine whether the Samd14 SAM domain regulates progenitor function, we generated a SAM domain–deleted construct of Samd14 (Samd14 ΔSAM) and analyzed its function in the genetic rescue assay with cells from Samd14–Enh-deleted bone marrow and spleen (Fig. 4A). In CFU assays, Samd14 increased GFP+ colony formation 2.7-fold (p = 0.004). By contrast, Samd14 ΔSAM did not significantly affect colonies compared with EV (Fig. 4B). Relative to Samd14, Samd14 ΔSAM induced 1.9-fold fewer (p = 0.0006) burst-forming unit–erythroid (BFU-E) colonies (Fig. 4B). Samd14 or Samd14 ΔSAM expression did not impact the levels of CFU-erythroid (CFU-E) and CFU-granulocyte/monocyte (CFU-GM) colonies (Fig. 4B). As an indirect measure of progenitor levels, we utilized two flow-cytometry approaches to identify populations of cells enriched in BFU-E or CFU-E (6Harandi O.F. Hedge S. Wu D.C. McKeone D. Paulson R.F. Murine erythroid short-term radioprotection requires a BMP4-dependent, self-renewing population of stress erythroid progenitors.J. Clin.

Samd14 expression increased the number of CD71lowKit+ cells that are enriched in BFU-E. Samd14 ΔSAM has 1.4-fold lower CD71lowKit+ than Samd14 (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4C). The levels of CD71highKit+ cells, enriched in CFU-E, were not altered between Samd14 and Samd14 ΔSAM. The levels of Lin−Sca1+Kit+CD71low is 1.65-fold lower in Samd14 ΔSAM versus Samd14 (p = 0.036) (Fig. 4D). Thus, the Samd14 SAM domain is an important determinant of progenitor cell levels and function. To distinguish among mechanisms of Samd14 SAM domain activity, we tested whether Samd14 ΔSAM subcellular localization resembles or contrasts from that of Samd14. Immunofluorescence analysis with cultures of splenic erythroid progenitors revealed both Samd14 and Samd14 ΔSAM localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 5A). To determine whether Samd14 co-localized with c-Kit, we conducted immunofluorescence using structured illumination microscopy followed by quantitative co-localization analysis (Fig. S2A). In cells expressing either Samd14 or Samd14 ΔSAM, Samd14 and c-Kit localization patterns did not correlate (r < 0.1), suggesting that the majority of Samd14 and c-Kit do not co-localize (Fig. S2B). To test whether Samd14 co-localizes with c-Kit after c-Kit activation, we treated cells with SCF for 5 min prior to immunofluorescence analysis. Whereas the correlation values were low in both SCF-treated versus nontreated cells, the correlation coefficient between Samd14 or Samd14 ΔSAM in relation to c-Kit increased 3.2- and 2.6-fold, respectively (Fig. S2). We tested whether Samd14 SAM is important for Samd14 promotion of c-Kit signaling. Samd14- and Samd14 ΔSAM-infected cells were treated with SCF for various times and fixed prior to phospho-flow cytometric analysis. GFP+Kit+ cells were analyzed after a 72-h culture (Fig. S3). SCF treatment of Samd14- (but not Samd14 ΔSAM)-expressing cells for 5 min increased pAKT compared with EV controls (Fig. 5B). At 10 min post-SCF treatment, Samd14 expression increased pAKT levels 1.6-fold (p = 0.0065); Samd14 ΔSAM did not alter pAKT levels (Fig. 5C). Expression of Samd14, but not Samd14 ΔSAM, increased pERK levels relative to EV controls (Fig. 5D). In Samd14-expressing cells, pERK increased 2.0-fold (p = 0.003) at 2 min, 2.0-fold (p = 0.016) at 5 min, and 2.5-fold (p = 0.002) at 10 min versus EV control. In Samd14 ΔSAM-expressing cells, pERK levels, relative to EV controls, were unaffected and significantly lower than in Samd14-expressing cells (Fig. 5E). In bone marrow progenitor cultures, Samd14 or Samd14 ΔSAM expression did not alter SCF-mediated induction of pAKT (Fig. S4). Thus, in spleen erythroid progenitors, the Samd14 SAM domain promoted c-Ki"

To exploit new synthetic allohexaploid lines available as bridges for wheat breeding, a total of 26 synthetic hexaploid lines were generated through crossing between the durum wheat cultivar Langdon and 26 accessions of Ae. umbellulata. In nascent synthetic hexaploids with the AABBUU genome, the presence of the set of seven U-genome chromosomes was confirmed with U-genome chromosome-specific markers developed based on RNA-seq-derived data from Ae. umbellulata. The AABBUU synthetic hexaploids showed large variations in flowering- and morphology-related traits, and these large variations transmitted well from the parental Ae. umbellulata accessions. However, the variation ranges in most traits examined were reduced under the AABBUU hexaploid background compared with under the diploid parents. The AABBUU and AABBDD synthetic hexaploids were clearly discriminated by several morphological traits, and an increase of plant height and in the number of spikes and a decrease of spike length were commonly observed in the AABBUU synthetics. Thus, interspecific differences in several morphological traits between Ae. umbellulata and A. tauschii largely affected the basic plant architecture of the synthetic hexaploids. In conclusion, the AABBUU synthetic hexaploid lines produced in the present study are useful resources for the introgression of desirable genes from Ae. umbellulata to common wheat."
https://openalex.org/W3014935908,"Objective Exposure to early-life adversity (ELA) can result in long-term changes to physiological systems, which predispose individuals to negative health outcomes. This biological embedding of stress-responsive systems may operate via dysregulation of physiological resources in response to common stressors. The present pilot study outlines a novel experimental design to test how young adults’ exposure to ELA influences neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses to acute stress. Materials and methods Participants were 12 males (mean age = 21.25), half of whom endorsed at least three significant adverse events up to age 18 years (‘ELA group’), and half who confirmed zero (‘controls’). Using a randomized within-subjects, between-groups experimental design, we induced acute psychosocial stress (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST), and included a no-stress control condition one week apart. During these sessions, we obtained repeated measurements of physiological reactivity, gene expression of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1), and plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα) over a 4-hour window post-test. Results In this pilot study, the ELA group evinced higher cortisol response and blunted NR3C1 gene expression in response to the TSST compared with controls, while no differences were observed in the no-stress condition. For pro-inflammatory cytokines, only IL-6 increased significantly in response to the TSST, with no differences between the two groups. Conclusion Overall, this pilot feasibility study provides a framework to investigate the biological embedding of early-adversity via dysregulation across physiological and genomic systems in response to acute psychosocial stress. ELA may program such systems in a maladaptive manner more likely to manifest during times of duress, predisposing individuals to the negative health consequences of everyday stressors. Future studies with larger sample size including both males and females are needed to replicate and expand upon these preliminary findings."
https://openalex.org/W3015109274,"Cassava green mite [CGM, Mononychellus tanajoa (Bondar)] is the most destructive dry-season pest in most cassava production areas. The pest is responsible for cassava fresh root yield losses of over 80%. Deployment of CGM resistant cultivars is the most cost-effective and sustainable approach of alleviating such production losses. The purposes of this study were to validate the stability of CGM resistance genes found in previously published results, to identify new genes for CGM resistance in bi-parental mapping population and estimate the heritability of the trait. A total of 109 F1 progeny derived from a cross between CGM resistant parent, TMEB778 and a very susceptible parent, TMEB419 were evaluated under CGM hotspot areas in Nigeria for two cropping seasons. A total of 42,204 SNP markers with MAF ≥ 0.05 were used for single-marker analysis. The most significant QTL (S12_7962234) was identified on the left arm on chromosome 12 which explained high phenotypic variance and harboured significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers conferring resistance to CGM and leaf pubescence (LP). Colocalization of the most significant SNP associated with resistance to CGM and LP on chromosome 12 is possibly an indication of a beneficial pleiotropic effect or are physically linked. These significant SNPs markers were intersected with the gene annotations and 33 unique genes were identified within SNPs at 4 – 8MB on chromosome 12. Among these genes, nine novel candidate genes namely; Manes.12077600, Manes.12G086200, Manes.12G061200, Manes.12G083100, Manes.12G082000, Manes.12G094100, Manes.12G075600, Manes.12G091400 and Manes.12G069300 highly expressed direct link to cassava green mite resistance.

Taking approximately six to seven months, the seeds germination under natural conditions experiences dual dormancies, which seriously affects horticultural cultivation. Few studies have been conducted on exploring both biological and molecular mechanism that regulates dormancy removal process in hypocotyls double dormant plants. Here, we first measured ABA and GA3 content changes at four key dormancy break stages, and then performed transcriptomic analyses to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using RNA-seq. We subsequently carried out Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to validate RNA-seq data. ABA content decreased during the whole dormancy removal process and GA3 content exhibited decreasing slightly and then increasing trend. RNA sequencing de novo assembly generated a total of 99,577 unigenes. 20,344 unigenes were differentially expressed in the whole dormancy release process. The qPCR results of 54 selected unigenes were consistent with the FPKM values obtained from RNA-seq. Our results summarize a valuable collection of gene expression profiles characterizing the dormancy release process. The DEGs are candidates for functional analyses of genes affecting the dormancy release, which is a precious resource for the on-going physiological and molecular investigation of seeds dormancy removal in other perennial plants."

Methods A retrospective cohort study using linked administrative health data for all non-Indigenous births in WA from 2005–2013 was performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for stillbirth in migrants from six ethnicities of white, Asian, Indian, African, Māori, and ‘other’, with different levels of acculturation, were compared with Australian-born women using multivariable logistic regression analysis and marital status, maternal age group, socioeconomic status, parity, plurality, previous stillbirth, any medical conditions, any pregnancy complications, sex of baby, and smoking during pregnancy as the covariates. Results From all births studied, 172,571 (66%) were to Australian-born women and 88,395 (34%) to migrant women. Women from African, Indian and Asian backgrounds who gave birth in the first two years after arrival in Australia experienced the highest risk of stillbirth (aOR 3.32; 95% CI 1.70–6.47, aOR 2.71; 95% CI 1.58–4.65, aOR 1.93; 95% CI 1.21–3.05 respectively) compared with Australian-born women. This association attenuated with an increase in the length of residence in Asian and Indian women, but the risk of stillbirth remained elevated in African women after five years of residence (aOR 1.96 [1.10–3.49]). Interpreter use and an Australian-born partner were associated with 56% and 20% lower odds of stillbirth in migrants (p<0.05), respectively. Conclusions Acculturation is a multidimensional process and may lower the risk of stillbirth through better communication and service utilisation and elevate such risk through increase in prevalence of smoking in pregnancy; the final outcome depends on how these factors are in play in a population. It is noteworthy that in women of African background risk of stillbirth remained elevated for longer periods after immigrating to Australia extending beyond five years. For migrants from Asian and Indian backgrounds, access to services, in the first two years of residence, may be more relevant. Enhanced understanding of barriers to accessing health services and factors influencing and influenced by acculturation may help developing interventions to reduce the burden of stillbirth in identified at-risk groups."

It is influenced by driver attitude toward secondary tasks; however, field-based studies on the effects of low-perceived-risk tasks on lateral driving have rarely been reported. A total of 17 experienced non-professional drivers were recruited to participate in two secondary tasks: a cognitive experiment (conversation) and a visual distraction experiment (observation of following vehicles), each representing low-perceived-risk secondary tasks. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to evaluate the effects of low-perceived-risk tasks on lateral driving performance. ANOVA results indicated that compared with baseline (no task) lateral performance, lane-keeping ability was enhanced during cognitive distractions. In the visual distraction experiment, more than 50% of the distractions required 1-2 s. Lane deviation and its growth rate increased with the duration of distraction. Compared with cognitive distraction, lane deviation increased significantly with visual distraction, and lane-keeping performance was seriously impaired. For low-perceived-risk tasks, visual distractions impaired driving safety more seriously, compared with cognitive distractions, suggesting that drivers misjudge the risks associated with visual tasks. These results can contribute to the design of advanced driving-assistance systems and improve professional driver programs, potentially reducing the frequency of traffic accidents caused by distracted driving."

https://openalex.org/W3014878499,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been linked to several diseases and to regulation of almost every biological process. This together with their stability while freely circulating in blood suggests that they could serve as minimal-invasive biomarkers for a wide range of diseases. Successful miRNA-based biomarker discovery in plasma is dependent on controlling sources of preanalytical variation, such as cellular contamination and hemolysis, as they can be major causes of altered miRNA expression levels. Analysis of plasma quality is therefore a crucial step for the best output when searching for novel miRNA biomarkers.Plasma quality was assessed by three different methods in samples from mother-child duos (maternal and cord blood, N = 2x38), with collection and storage methods comparable to large cohort study biobanks. Total RNA was isolated and the expression profiles of 201 miRNAs was obtained by qPCR to identify differentially expressed miRNAs in cord and maternal plasma samples.All three methods for quality assurance indicate that the plasma samples used in this study are of high quality with very low levels of contamination, suitable for analysis of circulating miRNAs. We identified 19 significantly differentially expressed miRNAs between cord and maternal plasma samples (paired t-tests, FDR<0.05, and fold change>±1.5), and we observed low correlation of miRNA transcript levels between cord and maternal samples throughout our dataset.Our findings suggest that good quality plasma samples suitable for miRNA profiling can be achieved from samples collected and stored by large biobanks. Incorporation of extensive quality control measures, such as those established here, would be beneficial for future projects. The overall low correlation of miRNA expression between cord and maternal samples is an interesting observation, and promising for our future studies on identification of miRNA-based biomarkers in cord blood plasma, considering that these samples were collected at term and some exchange of blood components between cord and maternal blood frequently occur."
https://openalex.org/W3015141197,"The structurally homologous Mtf1 and TFB2M proteins serve as transcription initiation factors of mitochondrial RNA polymerases in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans, respectively. These transcription factors directly interact with the nontemplate strand of the transcription bubble to drive promoter melting. Given the key roles of Mtf1 and TFB2M in promoter-specific transcription initiation, it can be expected that the DNA binding activity of the mitochondrial transcription factors is regulated to prevent DNA binding at inappropriate times. However, little information is available on how mitochondrial DNA transcription is regulated. While studying C-terminal (C-tail) deletion mutants of Mtf1 and TFB2M, we stumbled upon a finding that suggested that the flexible C-tail region of these factors autoregulates their DNA binding activity. Quantitative DNA binding studies with fluorescence anisotropy-based titrations revealed that Mtf1 with an intact C-tail has no affinity for DNA but deletion of the C-tail greatly increases Mtf1's DNA binding affinity. Similar observations were made with TFB2M, although autoinhibition by the C-tail of TFB2M was not as complete as in Mtf1. Analysis of available TFB2M structures disclosed that the C-tail engages in intramolecular interactions with the DNA binding groove in the free factor, which, we propose, inhibits its DNA binding activity. Further experiments showed that RNA polymerase relieves this autoinhibition by interacting with the C-tail and engaging it in complex formation. In conclusion, our biochemical and structural analyses reveal autoinhibitory and activation mechanisms of mitochondrial transcription factors that regulate their DNA binding activities and aid in specific assembly of transcription initiation complexes.

Similar observations were made with TFB2M, although autoinhibition by the C-tail of TFB2M was not as complete as in Mtf1. Analysis of available TFB2M structures disclosed that the C-tail engages in intramolecular interactions with the DNA binding groove in the free factor, which, we propose, inhibits its DNA binding activity. Further experiments showed that RNA polymerase relieves this autoinhibition by interacting with the C-tail and engaging it in complex formation. In conclusion, our biochemical and structural analyses reveal autoinhibitory and activation mechanisms of mitochondrial transcription factors that regulate their DNA binding activities and aid in specific assembly of transcription initiation complexes. Mitochondrial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseaaamino acidsssDNAsingle-stranded DNALSPlight strand promoterBLIbiolayer interferometryNTnon-templatentnucleotidePOLRMTPolymerase mitochondrial. are evolutionarily related to the single-subunit bacteriophage T7/T3 RNAP (1Cermakian N.

No such regulatory mechanism has been reported for mitochondrial transcription factors. During our study of the C-terminal deletion mutants of Mtf1 (3Basu U. Lee S.W. Deshpande A. Shen J. Sohn B.K.

The C-terminal tail of the yeast mitochondrial transcription factor Mtf1 coordinates template strand alignment, DNA scrunching and timely transition into elongation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 (31980825): 2604-262010.1093/nar/gkaa040Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), we stumbled upon a new finding that suggested that the flexible C-terminal tail of Mtf1 has an autoinhibitory function in DNA binding. Mtf1 and TFB2M contain a flexible C-tail region consisting of 16–20 aa that, as we showed recently, plays a critical role in template strand alignment, including supporting high-affinity binding of the initiating nucleotide for an efficient RNA priming reaction (3Basu U.

The 16 aa of the Mtf1 C-tail were not resolved in the crystal structure (9Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Crystal structure of the transcription factor sc-mtTFB offers insights into mitochondrial transcription.Protein Sci. 2001; 10 (11567089): 1980-198810.1110/ps.11201Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), whereas in the crystal structures of TFB2M, the fully or partially resolved C-tail region was found to be in different conformations (8Hillen H.S. Morozov Y.I. Sarfallah A. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structural basis of mitochondrial transcription initiation.Cell. 2017; 171 (29149603): 1072-1081.e1010.1016/j.cell.2017.10.036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To investigate the regulatory role of the flexible C-tail region in DNA binding, we used fluorescence anisotropy–based titrations and measured the DNA Kd values of the WT and several C-tail deletion mutants of Mtf1 and TFB2M. We used promoter and nonpromoter sequences to test the specificity of the DNA binding site. Our studies show that DNA binding is nonspecific and that the C-tail region completely or partially suppresses the DNA binding activity of the factors. Inhibition is released, however, when the factors bind to RNAP and the C-tail is engaged with the RNAP. Based on our biochemical data and analysis of available structures, we propose a model that explains the autoinhibition and activation of DNA binding involving the C-tail of mitochondrial transcription factors. This model provides new insights into assembly and regulation of the mitochondrial transcription initiation complex. In this study, we used two Mtf1 C-tail deletion mutants that were used in our previous study (3Basu U. Lee S.W. Deshpande A. Shen J. Sohn B.K. Cho H. Kim H. Patel S.S. The C-terminal tail of the yeast mitochondrial transcription factor Mtf1 coordinates template strand alignment, DNA scrunching and timely transition into elongation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 (31980825): 2604-262010.1093/nar/gkaa040Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Mtf1-Δ20 lacks the entire C-tail region (20 aa), and the partially deleted C-tail mutant Mtf1-Δ12 lacks only the terminal 12 aa (Fig. 1A). Because Mtf1 binds to the nontemplate strand of the transcription bubble in the initiation complex (11Paratkar S. Patel S.S. Mitochondrial transcription factor Mtf1 traps the unwound non-template strand to facilitate open complex formation.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285 (20008320): 3949-395610.1074/jbc.M109.050732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we synthesized a 12-nt single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that contained the −8 to +4 sequence of the nontemplate strand of the yeast 15S rRNA promoter (Fig. 1B). This DNA included the −4 to +2 region that forms a transcription bubble (17Tang G.Q. Paratkar S. Patel S.S. Fluorescence mapping of the open complex of yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase.J. Biol.

Patel S.S. Mitochondrial transcription factor Mtf1 traps the unwound non-template strand to facilitate open complex formation.J. Biol.

We used fluorescence anisotropy–based titrations to measure the DNA Kd values (Fig. 1C) (18Tang G.Q. Deshpande A.P. Patel S.S. Transcription factor-dependent DNA bending governs promoter recognition by the mitochondrial RNA polymerase.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286 (21911502): 38805-3881310.1074/jbc.M111.261966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fluorescein-labeled 15S NT ssDNA was titrated with increasing concentrations of Mtf1 protein. We observed negligible changes in fluorescence anisotropy with Mtf1-WT and Mtf1-Δ12 even after adding 2 μm protein (Fig. 1D). On the other hand, Mtf1-Δ20, with a larger deletion of the C-tail, showed a significant increase in fluorescence anisotropy in titration experiments. The binding data of Mtf1-Δ20 fit well to a hyperbola and provided a Kd of ∼930 (±114) nm for the 15S NT complex. These results indicate that the presence of the full or even partial C-tail region inhibits the DNA binding activity of Mtf1. Thus, complete deletion of the C-tail is needed to activate the DNA binding activity of Mtf1. The DNA binding buffer in the above experiments contained 50 mm potassium glutamate. To determine whether the DNA binding interactions were salt-sensitive, we eliminated potassium glutamate from the buffer. Under less stringent salt conditions, we observed some amount of DNA binding to the Mtf1-WT and Mtf1-Δ12, although the amplitudes of fluorescence anisotropy change remained lower than with Mtf1-Δ20 (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, there was a clear C-tail length–dependent effect on the DNA binding amplitudes. Mtf1-WT with an intact C-tail showed the lowest amount of DNA binding, followed by Mtf1-Δ12 with an intermediate level of binding and Mtf1-Δ20 showing the highest amount of DNA binding. We do not know the exact reason for the different plateau in the anisotropy values for the different mutants. It could be due to higher-order interactions of the protein–DNA complexes in the absence of salt. Removal of the salt increased the DNA binding affinity of Mtf1-Δ20 by 18-fold. These results point to an ionic nature of interaction in the DNA binding groove and suggest that Mtf1 makes contact with the charged DNA phosphate backbone. Thus, competition with salt explains the lower DNA binding affinity of Mtf1-Δ12. To investigate whether the DNA binding groove of Mtf1 has a preference for binding a particular DNA sequence or structure, we compared the DNA Kd values of promoter versus nonpromoter sequences and ssDNA versus dsDNA. We used the template and nontemplate ssDNA of the yeast 15S promoter as DNA substrates, the duplex 15S promoter, an unrelated ssDNA sequence of the human mitochondrial promoter (LSP NT), and dT12 (Fig. 1B). Mtf1-WT did not bind to any of these DNA substrates. Mtf1-Δ20, on the other hand, bound to all DNA substrates (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1) with very similar Kd values (750–1000 nm). These results indicate that the DNA binding groove of Mtf1 has no sequence or structural preference for the DNA. This means that the C-tail prevents Mtf1 from binding to specific and nonspecific DNAs. In summary, the DNA binding studies described above provide first evidence that the C-tail region has a role in regulating the DNA binding activity of Mtf1 prior to transcription initiation. To understand how the C-tail region of Mtf1 inhibits DNA binding, we analyzed the structures of the homologous human TFB2M protein (8Hillen H.S. Morozov Y.I. Sarfallah A. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structural basis of mitochondrial transcription initiation.Cell. 2017; 171 (29149603): 1072-1081.e1010.1016/j.cell.2017.10.036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The C-tail region in free TFB2M is fully resolved in chain A of the molecule (Fig. 2A, TFB2M in green and C-tail in red). In chain A, the C-tail makes intramolecular interactions with the DNA binding groove (Fig. S2). In the initiation structure, the DNA binding groove is engaged with the nontemplate strand (Fig. 2A, sky blue), and therefore, the C-tail (Fig. 2A, orange) is projected in a different direction away from the DNA binding groove. Thus, analysis of the TFB2M structures suggests that the conformation of the flexible C-tail in free TFB2M is sterically incompatible with DNA binding. Although Mtf1 and TFB2M share only 12% sequence identity, there is a high degree of structural homology between the two proteins (Fig. 2A, Mtf1 in rose and TFB2M in green). We hypothesized that the DNA binding activity of Mtf1 is similarly autoinhibited by C-tail interactions with the DNA binding groove. The above structural analysis predicts that the C-tail will inhibit the DNA binding activity of TFB2M. To directly test the autoinhibitory role of the C-tail in TFB2M, we measured the DNA Kd values of TFB2M-WT and its two C-tail deletion mutants, TFB2M-Δ3 and TFB2M-Δ13, which lack three and 13 aa of the C-tail, respectively (Fig. 2A) (3Basu U. Lee S.W. Deshpande A. Shen J. Sohn B.K. Cho H. Kim H. Patel S.S. The C-terminal tail of the yeast mitochondrial transcription factor Mtf1 coordinates template strand alignment, DNA scrunching and timely transition into elongation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 (31980825): 2604-262010.1093/nar/gkaa040Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In our initial DNA binding studies, we used the nontemplate ssDNA of the human mitochondrial light strand promoter (LSP NT) as the substrate, which contains the DNA sequence that binds to TFB2M in the initiation complex. Additionally, we synthesized the LSP duplex and unrelated 15S NT and dT12 ssDNAs to determine whether TFB2M has a preference for binding to promoter sequences (Fig. 2B). TFB2M-WT binds to LSP NT ssDNA with a Kd of about 180 (±22) nm, and deletion of 13 aa of the TFB2M C-tail increases the DNA binding affinity of LSP NT by about 4-fold (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3). Deletion of 3 aa of the C-tail results in an intermediate level of DNA binding (Fig. 2C and Fig. S3). This shows a C-tail length–dependent effect on DNA binding activity, similar to Mtf1. Studies with other DNA sequences indicate that TFB2M binds to all DNAs but with different Kd values (Fig. 2D). The nonpromoter 15S NT ssDNA binds with a Kd of 130 (±11) nm, which is similar to the Kd of LSP NT. Thus, the DNA binding activity of free TFB2M appears to be nonspecific. The LSP duplex has a 3-fold higher affinity than LSP NT ssDNA. For reasons unknown, TFB2M has a high affinity for dT12 DNA. In all cases, however, C-tail deletion increases the DNA binding affinity of TFB2M. Thus, our results show that the C-tail of TFB2M autoinhibits the DNA binding activity but that autoinhibition by the C-tail of TFB2M is not absolute as observed in Mtf1. The general trend is the same; that is, the presence of the C-tail inhibits the DNA binding activity. Thus, the C-tail has a conserved role in autoinhibiting the DNA binding activity of the free mitochondrial transcription factors. Next we asked how the DNA binding activity of Mtf1 and TFB2M is activated for transcription initiation. Structural analysis shows that, in the initiation complex, the partially resolved C-tail of TFB2M interacts with the RNAP subunit POLRMT (Fig. S4) (8Hillen H.S. Morozov Y.I. Sarfallah A. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structural basis of mitochondrial transcription initiation.Cell. 2017; 171 (29149603): 1072-1081.e1010.1016/j.cell.2017.10.036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This suggests that RNAP may release the autoinhibited state by engaging the C-tail in an altered conformation. To investigate the RNAP-mediated mechanism of activation, we investigated whether the C-tail has a role in complex formation with the RNAP subunit. We used biolayer interferometry (BLI) and ultrafiltration approaches and measured protein–protein interactions between Mtf1 and the RNAP subunit Rpo41. His-tagged Mtf1-WT and Mtf1-Δ20 proteins were immobilized on the anti-His BLI biosensors, and binding to Rpo41 was assessed by measuring the time-dependent increase in the light interference signal (Fig. 3A and Fig. S5). The amplitude of light interference corresponding to the amount of Rpo41–Mtf1 complex was recorded and plotted against increasing concentrations of Rpo41 (Fig. 3B and S5). The resulting binding curves indicated robust binding of Mtf1-WT to Rpo41 and relatively little binding of Mtf1-Δ20 to Rpo41. Ultrafiltration is an alternative solution-based method that has been used previously to assay complex formation between Rpo41 and Mtf1 (19Velazquez G. Sousa R. Brieba L.G. The thumb subdomain of yeast mitochondrial RNA polymerase is involved in processivity, transcript fidelity and mitochondrial transcription factor binding.RNA Biol. 2015; 12 (25654332): 514-52410.1080/15476286.2015.1014283Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Application of this method also showed efficient complex formation between Rpo41 and Mtf1-WT, as evident from retention of both proteins in the retentate (even after several washes) and almost no protein in the filtrate (Fig. 3C, Mtf1-WT, lanes 2 and 3). A stable complex was not observed with Mtf1-Δ20 (Fig. 3C, Mtf1-Δ20, lanes 2 and 3). Rpo41 was present in the retentate, and most of the Mtf1-Δ20 was in the filtrate. The above methods of analysis of protein–protein interactions provide consistent results indicating that the C-tail of Mtf1 is involved in complex formation with the RNAP subunit. We tried measuring complex formation between TFB2M and POLRMT in the absence of DNA using BLI and ultrafiltration, but these methods failed to provide consistent results because TFB2M binds nonspecifically to the biosensor probe and the filters. Hence, we used transcription assays and followed runoff products to monitor complex formation between TFB2M and POLRMT in the initiation complex. We used TFB2M-Δ3 and TFB2M-Δ7 in the runoff assays because TFB2M-Δ13 does not support transcription (3Basu U. Lee S.W. Deshpande A. Shen J. Sohn B.K. Cho H. Kim H. Patel S.S. The C-terminal tail of the yeast mitochondrial transcription factor Mtf1 coordinates template strand alignment, DNA scrunching and timely transition into elongation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 (31980825): 2604-262010.1093/nar/gkaa040Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Runoff synthesis was measured using an in vitro reconstituted complex of POLRMT, TFB2M, TFAM, and the LSP promoter (Fig. 4A). Transcription initiation from the LSP DNA produces short abortive RNAs and two runoff products 17- and 18-mer in length (Fig. 4B and Fig. S6). The two runoff products result from the two reported start sites on LSP (underlined in the LSP sequence in Fig. 4A) (3Basu U. Lee S.W. Deshpande A. Shen J. Sohn B.K. Cho H. Kim H. Patel S.S. The C-terminal tail of the yeast mitochondrial transcription factor Mtf1 coordinates template strand alignment, DNA scrunching and timely transition into elongation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 (31980825): 2604-262010.1093/nar/gkaa040Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 7Ramachandran A.

To measure the stability of the initiation complexes containing TFB2M-WT or C-tail deletion mutants, the transcription reactions were carried out at increasing TFB2M concentrations (Fig. 4, B and C, and Fig. S6). TFB2M-WT reactions showed a steeper increase in runoff RNA products with increasing TFB2M concentration compared with TFB2M-Δ3 and TFB2M-Δ7. Close to 4-fold greater amounts of mutant proteins were required to observe the same amount of runoff products as with TFB2M-WT. These results indicate that initiation complexes with C-tail deletion mutants are weaker compared with TFB2M-WT. The results are consistent with the model where the TFB2M C-tail is involved in complex formation with the RNAP subunit. Thus, the results with Mtf1 and TFB2M suggest a consistent mechanism of activation of the DNA binding activity of mitochondrial transcription factors. The mitochondrial transcription factors Mtf1 and TFB2M of S. cerevisiae and humans, respectively, have a well-established role in promoter melting during transcription initiation (8Hillen H.S.

These homologous transcription factors bind to the nontemplate strand of the transcription bubble to drive the promoter melting step. In this study, we show that the DNA binding activity of the transcription factors is autoinhibited by their C-terminal tail regions prior to their association with the RNAP subunit. Mtf1 and TFB2M contain a flexible C-terminal tail region of 16–20 aa that, as we showed recently, plays important roles in transcription initiation (3Basu U. Lee S.W. Deshpande A. Shen J. Sohn B.K. Cho H. Kim H. Patel S.S. The C-terminal tail of the yeast mitochondrial transcription factor Mtf1 coordinates template strand alignment, DNA scrunching and timely transition into elongation.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48 (31980825): 2604-262010.1093/nar/gkaa040Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This study shows that the C-tail has additional roles in regulating the DNA binding activity of the free factors. Parallel studies of the yeast and human mitochondrial transcription factors provided an opportunity to compare and contrast the mechanism of DNA regulation by the C-tail region. We find that the C-tail regions of Mtf1 and TFB2M have a conserved role in autoinhibiting the DNA binding activity of the free factors. Quantitation of DNA binding activity, however, shows that the C-tail of Mtf1 drastically inhibits DNA binding, whereas the C-tail of TFB2M only partially inhibits DNA binding. Moreover, it appears that the DNA binding activity of the free factors is nonspecific. The activated factors bind to single-stranded DNA and dsDNA. Based on our results, we propose that Mtf1 is unlikely to associate with nonspecific DNA regions prior to transcription initiation. On the other hand, unless there are alternative means of inhibiting the DNA binding activity, free TFB2M will associate with DNA prior to initiation. Based on the crystal structure of TFB2M, we propose that the flexible C-tail can exist in two conformations: an autoinhibited state and a free state (Fig. 5B). The crystal structure of free TFB2M shows two conformations of the C-tail in the two molecules of the asymmetric unit (Fig. 5A, cyan and sand). In chain A, the C-tail (Fig. 5A, red) is in the autoinhibited state making intramolecular interactions with the DNA binding groove and masking the DNA binding site. In chain B, the partially resolved C-tail (Fig. 5A, sand) projects away from the DNA binding groove and is more in line with the C-tail in the initiation complex (Fig. 5A, green). We propose that the equilibrium constants of the free and autoinhibited states is different in Mtf1 and TFB2M. The Mtf1 C-tail is mostly in the autoinhibited state, whereas a significant portion of the TFB2M C-tail is in the free state. It is not known whether TFB2M binds DNA under cellular conditions because it might be regulated by additional mechanisms. For example, it is known that TFB2M is posttranslationally modified and that some of the modifications are in the C-tail region (13Hornbeck P.V. Zhang B. Murray B. Kornhauser J.M. Latham V. Skrzypek E. PhosphoSitePlus, 2014: mutations, PTMs and recalibrations.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25514926): D512-D52010.1093/nar/gku1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). Thus, the C-tail autoinhibition mechanism can be potentially reinforced by C-tail modifications. However, further studies are needed to understand these alternative mechanisms of TFB2M regulation. This study also provides insights into how the transcription factors are activated for promoter-specific transcription initiation. It turns out that the C-tail region is essential for forming a stable complex with RNAP. Thus, it appears that the RNAP subunit can activate the factors by engaging the C-tail with itself, releasing it from the autoinhibited state. The structure of TFB2M shows that the C-tail relocates from the DNA binding groove and is engaged with the thumb domain and the intercalating hairpin of RNAP in the initiation complex (Fig. S4) (8Hillen H.S. Morozov Y.I. Sarfallah A. Temiakov D. Cramer P. Structural basis of mitochondrial transcription initiation.Cell. 2017; 171 (29149603): 1072-1081.e1010.1016/j.cell.2017.10.036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The C-tail engagement with RNAP would expose the DNA binding groove, which can bind to the nontemplate strand and stabilize the transcription bubble in the initiation complex. Autoregulatory mechanisms are widely found in biological processes, including DNA transcription. Bacterial and eukaryotic transcription factors, such as σ-70 and Ets-1, have a built-in regulatory domain that modulates their DNA binding activity prior to transcription. The DNA binding activity of σ-70 is autoinhibited by the σ-1.1 domain, and, similar to mitochondrial transcription factors, autoinhibition is relieved when σ-70 forms a complex with the RNAP subunit (16Schwartz E.C. Shekhtman A. Dutta K. Pratt M.R. Cowburn D. Darst S. Muir T.W. A full-length group 1 bacterial σ factor adopts a compact structure incompatible with DNA binding.Chem.

Autoinhibition by a flexible C-terminal tail is also found in various DNA binding proteins. For example, the DNA binding activity of gp2.5 protein of bacteriophage T7 and bacterial single-stranded DNA-binding protein is autoinhibited by their acidic C-tails (14Kozlov A.G. Cox M.M. Lohman T.M. Regulation of single-stranded DNA binding by the C termini of Escherichia coli single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein.J. Biol.

Thus, this study identifies a previously unknown and conserved role of the C-tail in regulating the DNA binding activity of yeast and human mitochondrial transcription factors. Such autoregulatory mechanisms increase the specificity of the transcription reaction and prevent transcription from occurring at nonpromoter sites. Oligodeoxynucleotides were custom-synthesized with a 5′-end fluorescein modification and purified by HPLC (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). DNA concentration was determined from absorbance at 260 nm and the corresponding molar extinction coefficients. Complementary ssDNAs were mixed at a 1:1 ratio, annealed at 95 °C for 1 min, and cooled over 1 h to room temperature to construct the duplex DNA molecules. Expression and purification of Mtf1, TFB2M, and the respective C-tail deletion mutant proteins were carried out as reported previously (3Basu U. Lee S.W. Deshpande A. Shen J. Sohn B.K. Cho H. Kim H.

The yeast proteins were stored in 50% glycerol and the human proteins were stored in 10% glycerol at −80 °C. The molar concentrations of the proteins were determined in guanidium HCl buffer from absorbance measurements at 280 nm and the respective molar extinction coefficients. Fluorescence anisotropy-based titration experiments were carried out on a Fluoro-Max-4 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon-Spex Instruments S.A., Inc.) at 25 °C. Fluorescein-labeled DNA (5 nm) was titrated with Mtf1-WT, TFB2M, or the C-tail deletion mutants. Reaction buffer A (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 50 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm DTT, and 0.05% Tween 20) was used in studies of Mtf1, and reaction buffer B (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 100 mm sodium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm DTT, and 0.01% Tween 20) was used in studies of the TFB2M. Anisotropy values (robs) were recorded with excitation at 490 nm (4-nm bandwidth) and emission at 514 nm (8-nm bandwidth). The robs were plotted against total protein concentration ([P]) and fit to Equation 1 to obtain the Kd. Here, rmax is the fluorescence anisotropy amplitude, and rf is the initial fluorescence anisotropy of the DNA before protein addition. robs=rmax⁡×[P]Kd′+[P]+rf(Eq. 1) The BLItz binding assays were performed with the Fortebio BLItz system with a Dip and Read Penta-HIS (HIS1K) biosensor (ForteBio) using the tube method to measure complex formation between Rpo41 and Mtf1. The probes were equilibrated in water overnight and then in buffer A for 30 min prior to use. The biosensors were washed in buffer A for 60 s to obtain the baseline. Mtf1 (400 nm) was immobilized on HIS1K biosensors for 300 s, washed in buffer A for 60 s, dipped in increasing concentrations of Rpo41 solution (50–800 nm), and finally washed again in buffer A for 60 s. The wavelength shift was recorded in real time with ForteBio software. An equimolar complex of Rpo41 and Mtf1 (2 μm each) was mixed in reaction buffer C (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 100 mm potassium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm fresh DTT, 0.01% protein-grade Tween 20, and 5% glycerol) in a final volume of 500 μl. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 15 min (initial protein complex) before filtering through a 100-kDa molecular mass cutoff Microcon centrifugal filter unit until the volume of the first retentate was about 50 μl (1/10 of initial mixture). The retentate was diluted to 500 μl with buffer C and filtered again. This washing step was repeated, and a sample was taken after three and five washes. Samples consisting of initial protein complex, first retentate, filtrate, and three and five retentate samples were collected and run on a 4%–20% SDS-PAGE gel. Transcription reactions were carried out at 25 °C using 1 μm POLRMT, 1 μm TFAM, 1 μm TFB2M-WT or deletion mutants, and 1 μm promoter DNA in transcription buffer (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 100 mm sodium glutamate, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm DTT, and 0.01% Tween 20). For runoff RNA synthesis, we used 250 μm ATP, UTP, or GTP spiked with [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were stopped after 15 min using 400 mm EDTA and formamide dye (98% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 10 mm EDTA). Samples were heated to 95 °C for 2 min and chilled on ice, and the RNA products were resolved on a 24% sequencing gel containing 4 m urea. The gel was exposed to a phosphor screen overnight and scanned on a Typhoon 9410 PhosphorImager instrument (Amersham Biosciences). The free ATP and RNA bands were quantified using ImageQuant, and molar amounts of RNA synthesized were calculated according to Equation 2: RNA synthesized(μM)=RR+A×[ATP](μM)(Eq. 2) where R and A are the band intensities of RNA products and free ATP, respectively, and [ATP] is the molar concentration of ATP added to the reaction.

https://openalex.org/W3014780274,"Loss of tolerance to nuclear antigens and multisystem tissue destruction is a hallmark of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Although the source of autoantigen in lupus remains elusive, a compelling hypothetical source is dead cell debris that drives autoimmune activation. Prior reports suggest that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and their associated death pathway, NETosis, are sources of autoantigen in SLE. However, others and we have shown that inhibition of NETs by targeting the NADPH oxidase complex and peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PADI4) did not ameliorate disease in spontaneous murine models of SLE. Furthermore, myeloperoxidase and PADI4 deletion did not inhibit induced lupus. Since NET formation may occur independently of any one mediator, to address this controversy, we genetically deleted an additional important mediator of NETs and neutrophil effector function, neutrophil elastase (ELANE), in the MRL.Faslpr model of SLE. ELANE deficiency, and by extension ELANE-dependent NETs, had no effect on SLE nephritis, dermatitis, anti-self response, or immune composition in MRL.Faslpr mice. Taken together with prior data from our group and others, these data further challenge the paradigm that NETs and neutrophils are pathogenic in SLE."

https://openalex.org/W3015042582,"Background Undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) patients hospitalized because of comorbidities constitute a challenge to TB control in hospitals. We aimed to assess the impact of introducing highly sensitive fluorescent microscopy for examining sputum smear to replace conventional microscopy under a high TB risk setting. Methods We measured the impact of switch to fluorescent microscopy on the smear detection rate of culture-confirmed pulmonary TB, timing of respiratory isolation, and total non-isolated infectious person-days in hospital at a high-caseload medical center (approximately 400 TB cases annually) in Taipei. Multivariable Cox regression was applied to adjust for effects of covariates. The effect attributable to the improved smear detection rate was determined using causal mediation analysis. Results After switch to fluorescence microscopy, median non-isolated infectious duration decreased from 12.5 days to 3 days (P<0.001). Compared with conventional microscopy, fluorescence microscopy increased sputum smear detection rate by two-fold (for all patients: from 22.8% to 48.1%, P<0.001; for patients with cavitary lung lesion: from 43% to 82%, P = 0.029) and was associated with a 2-fold higher likelihood of prompt respiratory isolation (odds ratio mediated by the increase in sputum smear detection rate: 1.8, 95% CI 1.3–2.5). Total non-isolated infectious patient-days in hospital decreased by 69% (from 4,778 patient-days per year to 1,502 patient-days per year). Conclusions In a high TB caseload setting, highly sensitive rapid diagnostic tools could substantially improve timing of respiratory isolation and reduce the risk of nosocomial TB transmission."
