https://openalex.org/W2060946783,IN the course of biometrical work concerning twenty different human samples—the individual figures partly obtained by myself and partly taken from other sources—I have found the following values for the body-weight/body-surface ratio (kgm./m.2):

During investigations of structural proteins in the vertebrates and invertebrates, I have found evidence of quinone-tanned proteins in the central capsule membrane of Thalassicola, the external cortical layer of the cuticle in Ascaris lumbricoides, the chætæ of Aphrodite, the byssus1 and periostracum of Mytilus edule, the byssus of Dreissensia polymorpha and in the egg cases of various selachian fishes. There are numerous other structures, such as the winter egg cases of planarians and the egg cases of various molluscs and earthworms which suggest, by their colour, the presence of aromatic-tanned protein. Ellerby2 has evidence for quinone tanning in the cyst wall of eelworms."

 of muscle fibers and their arrangement in muscle tissue. This article briefly described the regular, close-packed arrangement
 of fibers visible in transverse and longitudinal sections of rabbit psoas muscle."

https://openalex.org/W2085374250,"IN a previous paper1, we have shown that when preparing heart actin a contamination followed the actin. This contamination, which apparently is a deaminase, acted on the adenosine triphosphate in the actin and thus prevented the polymerization of the actin to a very great extent. A little adenosine triphosphate added to the solution from outside strongly catalysed the effect of the deaminase."

https://openalex.org/W2054744670,"DURING April and May 1949, Ectocarpus granulosus C. Agardh growing at mean low-water spring tide at Saltstone, which is about 1½ miles up the River Sal, from Salcombe, was heavily infected with a parasitic fungus. The Saltstone habitat is a purely marine one and is sheltered in the river estuary. The Ectocarpus grows attached to small stones and to other algæ in the Vaucheria-community. By July most of the Ectocarpus plants had disappeared from the locality."

It has been reported2 that ‘Pelentan’ is less toxic than dicoumarol, acts with less delay and is more quickly eliminated. During a pharmacological study of ‘Pelentan’, it was found that its solutions inhibit human serum cholinesterase. In continuation of these observations, a comparison has been made of the inhibition of serum cholinesterase by some esters of pelentanic acid and by dicoumarol."

Some interesting observations were made in the liver, spleen and gastric and intestinal mucosæ."

Every wave-length, after having passed through the filter, has its maximum intensity in the direction of the incident light. Although it is possible to construct a Christiansen monochromator in which the width, in wave-lengths, between the points on each side of the transmitted band at which the intensity is reduced to one-half, or even one-tenth, is small, the corresponding distance for the reduction of intensity to one-thousandth is of considerable size."
