We report two paclitaxel-resistant sublines derived from 1A9 human ovarian carcinoma cells. Single-step paclitaxel selection with verapamil yielded two clones that are resistant to paclitaxel and collaterally sensitive to vinblastine. The resistant sublines are not paclitaxel-dependent, and resistance remained stable after 3 years of drug-free culture. All cell lines accumulate [3H]paclitaxel equally, and no MDR-1mRNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction following reverse transcription. Total tubulin content is similar, but the polymerized fraction increased in parental but not in resistant cells following the paclitaxel addition. Purified tubulin from parental cells demonstrated paclitaxel-driven increased polymerization, in contrast to resistant cell tubulin, which did not polymerize under identical conditions. In contrast, epothilone B, an agent to which the resistant cells retained sensitivity, increased assembly. Comparable expression of β-tubulin isotypes was found in parental and resistant cells, with predominant expression of the M40 and β2 isotypes. Sequence analysis demonstrated acquired mutations in the M40 isotype at nucleotide 810 (T → G; Phe270 → Val) in 1A9PTX10 cells and nucleotide 1092 (G → A; Ala364 → Thr) in 1A9PTX22 cells. These results identify residues β270 and β364 as important modulators of paclitaxel's interaction with tubulin.

The primary target of PTX is the microtubule (MT), which is vital for mitosis, motility, secretion, and proliferation (5Hyams J.F. Loyd C.W. Microtubules. Wiley-Liss, New York1993Google Scholar). PTX stabilizes MTs by disrupting the dynamic equilibrium between soluble tubulin dimers and their polymerized form (6Horwitz S.B. Cohen D. Rao S. Ringel I. Shen H.J. Yong C.P. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 15: 55-61Google Scholar) and is a potent inhibitor of chromosome replication, blocking cells in the late G2 or mitotic phases of the cell cycle (7Horwitz S.B. Trends Pharmacol.

Although precise molecular alterations in MTs have not been identified, several mechanisms have been proposed. These include decreased tubulin (10Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Cell Biochem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Google Scholar), point mutations as evidenced by altered migration of α- or β-tubulin on two-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (11Cabral F.

Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).To further elucidate the mechanism of action of PTX and to investigate mechanisms of PTX resistance other than those mediated by Pgp, we have isolated two PTX-resistant sublines derived from a human ovarian carcinoma cell line. Selected in the presence of the Pgp antagonist, verapamil, resistant cells do not express Pgp, but they exhibit a stable PTX-resistant phenotype. Compared with parental cells, resistant cells display defective PTX-driven tubulin polymerization both in intact cells and in vitro using purified tubulin. No differences are observed in the amount of total tubulin or in the relative level of expression of the β-tubulin isotypes. However, two different point mutations in β-tubulin were identified in the resistant cells. These results provide the first demonstration of tubulin point mutations in PTX-resistant cell lines and introduce a novel molecular mechanism of PTX resistance.DISCUSSIONDrug resistance can originate through multiple mechanisms, such as changes in cellular drug uptake, metabolic drug deactivation, structural changes in the drug target, or changes in other cellular components that interact with the target (29Pratt W.B. Ruddon R.W. Ensminger W.D. Maybaum J. Pratt W.B. Ruddon R.W. The Anticancer Drugs. Oxford University Press, New York1994: 50-66Google Scholar). Some of these have been implicated in the emergence of resistance to paclitaxel. To identify mechanisms of PTX resistance other that those mediated by Pgp, we isolated PTX-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. Two resistant cell lines, derived from a subclone of the human ovarian carcinoma line, A2780, were characterized. These sublines were isolated in a single step by exposure to PTX in the presence of the Pgp antagonist, verapamil. Previous studies have shown that verapamil can negate the appearance of Pgp, resulting in the selection of cells that exhibit other mechanisms of drug resistance (30Chen Y.-N. Mickley L.A. Schwartz A.M. Acton E.M. Hwang J. Fojo A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10073-10080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resistant cells are 24-fold more resistant to PTX, 1.4–3-fold more cross-resistant to either 2-debenzoyl-2-meta-azidobenzoylpaclitaxel or EPO B, and collaterally sensitive to vinblastine. Expression of MDR-1was not detectable, nor was PTX accumulation decreased in the resistant cells (data not shown). Thus, these cells provide a valid model of non-Pgp-mediated PTX resistance.In contrast to other PTX selected cell lines that have been reported, the resistant cells described in this study are not PTX-dependent for growth (18Ohta S. Kazuto N. Ohmori T. Funayama Y. Ohira T. Nakajiama H. Adachi M. Saijo N. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1994; 85: 290-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 31Cabral F.R. Brady R.C. Schibler M.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1986; 466: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Their growth rate is similar in the absence and presence of PTX (data not shown). This indicates that the resistant phenotype protects MT function from PTX effects without altering MT function in the absence of PTX. Furthermore, the resistant phenotype remained stable in the absence of drug for 3 years.Multiple changes in the PTX target, tubulin, have been reported in PTX-resistant cell lines. These include reduced total tubulin levels (10Minotti A.M. Barlow S.B. Cabral F. J. Cell Biochem. 1991; 266: 3987-3994Google Scholar, 24Murphy L.D. Herzog C.E. Rudick J.B. Fojo A.T. Bates S.E. Biochem. J. 1990; 29: 10351-10356Crossref Scopus (411) Google Scholar), increased tubulin content (15Haber M. Burkhart C.A. Regl D.L. Madafiglio J. Norris M.D. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1091-1097PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haber M. Burkhart C.A. Regl D.L. Madafiglio J. Norris M.D. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol.

In the present study, the total tubulin content of the resistant cells was similar to that of the parental cells (data not shown), and no differences in the acetylation of purified α-tubulin were observed (data not shown). Thus, we sought other explanation(s) for the origin of PTX resistance in these cells.Since PTX promotes tubulin polymerization, we compared the relative ratios of soluble and polymerized tubulin in the resistant cells. In a first approximation, immunofluorescent microscopy revealed no difference in the amount of MTs between the 1A9 parental cells and the resistant cells (data not shown). These results were confirmed and extended using the tubulin polymerization assay. Although this method of evaluation was designed to measure the response to added PTX rather than steady-state polymerization, similar ratios of polymerized and soluble tubulin were obtained for untreated cells for each cell line. In contrast, in the presence of PTX, a dose-dependent tubulin polymerization was observed only in 1A9 parental cells. In addition, mixing cell lysates from parental and resistant cells did not induce polymerization of tubulin in the resistant cell lysates, nor did parental cell-derived polymers recruit tubulin from the resistant cell lysates. Moreover, the degree of PTX-induced polymerization of tubulin purified from the resistant clones was less than that of the tubulin from the parental cell or from rat brain. These data suggested that the primary defect was one of tubulin structure or composition.Human genes coding for α- or β-tubulin constitute a multigene family of 15–20 members, several of which are pseudogenes (32Cleveland D.W.

Cowan N.J. Nature. 1982; 297: 83-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although there is some tissue specificity of isotype expression, the role of isotypes remains unclear (34Luduena R.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). It has been reported that isotype composition can regulate MT dynamics in vitro (35Pand D. Miller H. Banerjee A. Luduena R.F. Wilson L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11358-11362Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); however, transfection experiments have shown that exogenous isotypes are incorporated into microtubule structures and appear to function interchangeably (36Lewis S.A. Gu W. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that in the absence of a particular isotype, other isotypes are substituted without affecting normal function (36Lewis S.A. Gu W. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1987; 49: 539-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).The demonstration of differential expression of tubulin isotypes in cell lines resistant to MT active agents (14Dumontet C. Duran G.E. Steger K.A. Beketic-Oreskovic L. Sikic B.I. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1091-1097PubMed Google Scholar, 15Haber M. Burkhart C.A. Regl D.L. Madafiglio J. Norris M.D. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2584-2589PubMed Google Scholar) has prompted some authors to postulate this as a mechanism of PTX resistance. However, mutations in a tubulin isotype have not been excluded. Indeed, if an acquired mutation confers an advantage, prolonged selection might lead to its overexpression. This could manifest as altered isotype expression, although the selective advantage was conferred by the mutation and not by the native isotype.In the present study, M40 isotype expression was increased about 1.5-fold; however, this data appeared inadequate to explain the 24-fold PTX resistance, although the isotype expression levels might contribute to the drug-resistant phenotype. The polymerization results using either cell lysates (Fig. 1) or purified tubulin (Fig. 3) indicate that parental tubulin and hence the mixture of isotypes present in parental tubulin polymerizes in response to added PTX. Therefore, it seemed unlikely that a 1.5-fold change or less in the level of any of these PTX-responsive isotypes would result in PTX resistance. Consistent with this, point mutations in β-tubulin were found in the class I isotype, M40, which represented the majority of total β-tubulin mRNA. These two mutations in independently selected cells were not identical. The M40 β270 mutation in clone 1A9PTX10, a T → G substitution in nucleotide 810, changed amino acid 270 from phenylalanine (TTT) to valine (GTT). The M40 β364 mutation in clone 1A9PTX22, a G → A substitution in nucleotide 1092, changed amino acid 364 from alanine (GCA) to threonine (ACA). The remainder of the M40 nucleotide sequence in both clones was consistently found to be identical to the parental sequence. These changes in β-tubulin most likely contribute to PTX resistance in these cells.The oligonucleotide hybridization studies confirmed the expression of mutant β270 and β364 tubulins in the respective cell lines and demonstrated at the DNA level both wild type and mutant sequences. Interestingly, although an allele with wild type sequence was present in the DNA from both resistant sublines, only the mutant allele was expressed. This pattern of expression is under current investigation.Two models of resistance mechanisms might explain the effects of these mutations. It is possible that the mutations alter the PTX binding site such that PTX binding is inhibited but MT function is unaffected in the absence of PTX. Alternatively, it is possible that the mutations could alter a region of tubulin important for dimer-dimer contacts in the MT polymer, weakening the interaction and producing less stable MT (37Cabral F. Barlow S.B. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1593-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The addition of PTX up to some threshold level would then produce more normal MT rather than the “hyperstabilized” MT produced with wild type tubulin.We favor the first mechanism for several reasons. First, the resistant clones do not exhibit any MT defect in the absence of PTX, their growth rate is the same in the absence or presence of PTX, and they have doubling times similar to parental cells. It seems unlikely that the MT of these cells are hypostable. Second, hypostable MT should be made more normal by any MT-stabilizing drug, and these should confer similar relative resistance, but that was not observed. Rather, small structural changes in PTX altered the extent of resistance. For example, relative resistance to taxotere is less than half that to PTX (data not shown). The relative resistance to 2-debenzoyl-2-meta-azidobenzoylpaclitaxel, is even less. Moreover, the relative resistance to EPO-B, a MT-stabilizing agent structurally distinct from PTX that shares at least part of the same binding site, is less than 2-fold. Finally, the effects observed on cell growth paralleled an in vitro assay of drug-induced polymerization, using purified tubulin. PTX-induced polymerization of resistant tubulin was significantly decreased, but polymerization induced by EPO-B (Fig.3) or 2-debenzoyl-2-meta-azidobenzoylpaclitaxel (38Sackett D.L. Giannakakou P. Poruchynsky M. Fojo A.T. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1997; 40: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) was comparable with that obtained with parental or rat brain tubulin. Taken together, these results favor a mechanism based on weakening the interaction with the drug rather than weakening tubulin-tubulin interactions important to polymerization in the absence of drug.Fig. 6 compares the sites of the mutations with other known drug interaction sites and maps the residues or peptides within β-tubulin shown to interact with PTX, colchicine, and vinblastine/rhizoxin. Vinblastine and rhizoxin share a binding site that is distinct from that for colchicine or PTX (39Bai R. Pettit G.R. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17141-17149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hamel E. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 55: 31-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These sites/peptides were identified either by photoaffinity labeling or by induced structural changes. The sites identified by the latter, while not necessarily proximal to the binding site, are clearly affected by drug binding. Additionally, Fig. 6 shows the location of the two mutations identified in our study and the location of a loop exposed on the surface of the dimer. These features cluster in three regions of the sequence, indicated by brackets at the bottomof Fig. 6: the N-terminal 30 or 40 residues, a central region centered around residue 250, and a more C-terminal region containing residues 350–390. It is notable that these same regions comprise the sites of binding and action of agents that stabilize MT and enhance assembly, such as PTX, as well as of agents that inhibit assembly such as colchicine, vinblastine, and rhizoxin. These regions will be considered in turn.The N-terminal region can be photolabeled by PTX and by colchicine. PTX, with the photoreactive group on the C-13 side chain, labels a peptide containing residues 1–31 (41Rao S. Krauss N.E. Heerding J.M. Swindell C.S. Ringel I. Orr G.A. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3132-3134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Photolabeling with colchicine also identifies an N-terminal peptide of 1–36 (42Uppuluri S. Knipling L. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Additionally, this peptide contains Cys12, which is labeled by GTP (43Shivanna B.D. Mejillano M.R. Williams T.D. Himes R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 127-132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This residue, and the other cysteine residues indicated, will be discussed below.The central region around residue 250 contains peptides labeled by all three groups of drugs, a loop sequence affected by drug binding, and the site of mutation in PTX10. PTX, with the photoreactive group on the C-2 side chain, labels a peptide containing residues 217–231 (44Rao S. Orr G.A. Chaudhary A.G. Kingston D.G.I. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20235-20238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Photolabeling with colchicine again labels an overlapping peptide, containing residues 214–241 (42Uppuluri S. Knipling L. Sackett D.L. Wolff J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11598-11602Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Vinblastine binding labels a site contained in residues 175–213 (45Rai S.S. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14707-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This region also contains a surface-exposed, drug-sensitive loop sequence that contains the sole site of chymotrypsin cleavage in the native tubulin dimer, located after Tyr281 (46Sackett D.L. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9070-9076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Sackett D.L. Biswas B.B. Siddhartha R. Proteins: Structure, Function, and Engineering. Plenum Press, New York1995: 255-302Google Scholar). Exposure of this loop and consequent chymotryptic cleavage is enhanced by binding of colchicine, rhizoxin, or especially vinblastine (48Sackett D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7010-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) but is nearly completely suppressed by PTX (46Sackett D.L. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9070-9076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that the PTX10 mutation locates to residue 270 in the center of this region and just N-terminal proximal to the loop sequence reinforces the importance of this region of the sequence to the binding of polymerization-modulating drugs indicated by previous data. It is notable that the PTX analog that most strongly reversed the resistant phenotype, 2-debenzoyl-2-meta-azidobenzoylpaclitaxel, is identical to the compound used to label this region (44Rao S. Orr G.A. Chaudhary A.G. Kingston D.G.I. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20235-20238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).The third, most C-terminal region, contains sites labeled by rhizoxin and colchicine and an amphipathic helical region strongly affected by drug binding. Photolabeling with a colchicine analog demonstrates that the A-ring of colchicine interacts with Cys354 (49Bai R. Pei X.-F. Boye O. Getahun Z. Grover S. Bekisz S. Nguyen N.Y. Brossi A. Hamel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12639-12645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Rhizoxin photolabels a peptide containing residues 363–379 (50Sawada T. Kobayashi H. Hashimoto Y. Isawaki S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 1387-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This peptide overlaps a drug binding-sensitive amphipathic helical region containing residues ∼370–390, whose carboxyl-terminal end is unfolded and made chymotrypsin-sensitive by colchicine (51Sackett D.L. Varma J.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13560-13565Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Unfolding is antagonized by vinblastine or rhizoxin, which promotes a form more tightly folded and protease-resistant at this site than the drug-free dimer (48Sackett D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7010-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The location of the PTX22 mutation at residue 364 indicates that the PTX binding site contains contributions from this region of the sequence as well as the other two regions, as does the colchicine site.In order for sequences from these three regions, very distant in linear sequence from each other, to contribute to the PTX binding site on β-tubulin, they clearly must be in close proximity in the folded form of native tubulin. Several lines of evidence, independent of data regarding PTX binding, allow us to draw this conclusion. In addition to the clustering of data from multiple probes, the data from direct photolabeling with a single probe, colchicine, require that these sequences be close. Since colchicine labels peptides from all three regions, the contact sites within these peptides cannot be farther apart than the dimensions of the colchicine molecule, ∼11 Å (42Uppuluri S.

Additional compelling evidence comes from studies of cysteine cross-linking (52Little M. Luduena R.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 912: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 53Luduena R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Using a bifunctional cross-linker with maximum span of ∼9 Å, two cross-links could be formed in β-tubulin. One cross-link is between Cys12 (in the N-terminal region of Fig. 6) and Cys201 or Cys211 (in the central region of Fig. 6). The other is between Cys239 (in the central region) and Cys354 (in the C-terminal region). These cross-links are sensitive to drug binding; colchicine binding inhibits the Cys239–Cys354 cross-link, whereas vinblastine enhances it while inhibiting the Cys12–Cys201/Cys211 cross-link. Thus, data independent of PTX binding indicate that these three regions of the β-tubulin sequence are close in the native protein and that the interactions between them are altered in subtle but important ways by the binding of MT-active drugs, including both assembly inhibiting and assembly-promoting agents. The identification in the present work of residues β270 and β364 as important modulators of the interaction of PTX with tubulin add to our understanding of this important binding site.In summary, the present study describes the isolation and characterization of two PTX-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell lines. This study is the first to identify specific point mutations in tubulin that result in PTX resistance in human cells. Our data have identified regions of β-tubulin whose alteration abrogates PTX actionin vitro and confers cellular PTX resistance.

https://openalex.org/W2154350322,"Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is believed to injure endothelial cells in vivo through a number of mechanisms, including the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Earlier in vitro studies demonstrated that homocyst(e)ine (Hcy) decreases the biological activity of endothelium-derived relaxing factor and that this decrease can be reversed by preventing the generation of hydrogen peroxide. Here we show that Hcy treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells leads to a dose-dependent decrease in NO x (p = 0.001 by one-way analysis of variance) independent of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activity or protein levels and nos3 transcription, suggesting that Hcy affects the bioavailability of NO, not its production. We hypothesized that, in addition to increasing the generation of H2O2, Hcy decreases the cell's ability to detoxify H2O2 by impairing intracellular antioxidant enzymes, specifically the intracellular isoform of glutathione peroxidase (GPx). To test this hypothesis, confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells were treated with a range of concentrations of Hcy, and intracellular GPx activity was determined. Compared with control cells, cells treated with Hcy showed a significant reduction in GPx activity (up to 81% at 250 μm Hcy). In parallel with the decrease in GPx activity, steady-state GPx mRNA levels were also significantly decreased compared with control levels after exposure to Hcy, which appeared not to be a consequence of message destabilization. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which Hcy, in addition to increasing the generation of hydrogen peroxide, may selectively impair the endothelial cell's ability to detoxify H2O2, thus rendering NO more susceptible to oxidative inactivation.

Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is a disease caused by an abnormality in either an enzyme (cystathionine β-synthetase or temperature-sensitive methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) or a cofactor (folate, vitamin B12, or vitamin B6) required for homocysteine metabolism. These abnormalities lead to elevations in plasma concentrations of homocyst(e)ine (Hcy) 1The abbreviations used are: Hcy, homocyst(e)ine; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; β-MSA, β-mercaptosuccininc acid; DTPA, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; HMVEC, human microvascular endothelial cells; BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; eNOS, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase; kb, kilobase pair(s); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ANOVA, analysis of variance. and its precursor methionine as well as a reduction in plasma concentrations of cysteine (1Mudd S.H.

In its most severe form, hyperhomocyst(e)inemia confers a significant risk for thromboembolic complications that are often fatal (6Malinow M.R. Circulation. 1990; 81: 2004-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In contrast, the less severe form of the disease is commonplace and indolent, not presenting with clinical sequelae until the third or fourth decade of life. These individuals manifest atherosclerosis as well as recurrent episodes of acute arterial and venous thrombosis (6Malinow M.R. Circulation. 1990; 81: 2004-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) with near normal levels of fasting plasma homocyst(e)ine; following a methionine challenge, however, levels rise significantly compared with normal levels. Many studies demonstrate that hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis in the coronary, cerebral, and peripheral vasculature (7Kang S.S. Wong P.W. Cook H.Y. Norusis M.

The mechanism by which Hcy damages the vessel wall and supports atherothrombosis is still unknown and may be multifactorial. Brattstromet al. (12Brattstrom, L. E. (1989) Homocysteine in Vascular Disease: A Clinical Study of Homocysteine Metabolism in Health and in Vascular Disease, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Lund, Lund Sweden.Google Scholar) demonstrated that endothelial cells are adversely affected by hydrogen peroxide generated during the oxidation of Hcy to homocystine and other mixed disulfides. Other prothrombotic effects induced by Hcy that may promote vascular disease include increased expression of tissue factor (13Fryer R.H. Wilson B.D. Gubler D.B. Fitzgerald L.A. Rodgers G.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and factor V (14Rodgers G.M. Kane W.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1909-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) by endothelial cells, suppression of the anticoagulant activity of heparan sulfate on the endothelial cell surface (15Nishinaga M. Shimada K. Jpn. J. Clin. Pathol. 1994; 42: 340-345PubMed Google Scholar), and decreased expression of thrombomodulin and activated protein C (16Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Clin.

Invest. 1993; 91: 2873-2879Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Earlier in vitro studies by our laboratory showed that Hcy treatment of vessel rings reduces the biological activity of endothelium-derived relaxing factor (18Stamler J.S. Osborne J.A. Jaraki O. Rabbani L.E. Mullins M. Singel D. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). In addition, we showed that the generation of hydrogen peroxide from Hcy is prevented by S-nitrosation of its thiol group and that, in contrast to Hcy, S-nitrosohomocyst(e)ine has potent vasodilator and antiplatelet effects (18Stamler J.S. Osborne J.A. Jaraki O. Rabbani L.E. Mullins M. Singel D. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). In this study, we address the complex mechanisms for the decrease in endothelium-derived relaxing factor/NO by endothelial cells following Hcy treatment. Our data show that, in addition to increased hydrogen peroxide generation from Hcy oxidation, this biological thiol also uniquely decreases intracellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx). These results suggest a unique mechanism by which Hcy decreases bioavailable NO and consequently produces an oxidative in vivoenvironment in the vasculature.

Hanks' balanced saline solution without calcium or magnesium, fetal bovine serum, newborn calf serum, penicillin G, streptomycin sulfate, trypsin, and media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, consisted of 10 mmsodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC), used for the measurement of steady-state intracellular GPx mRNA, and CS-5.0 medium were purchased from Cell Systems Corp. (Kirkland, WA). Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated as described previously and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 containing 20% newborn calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G sodium and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate) (19Schwartz S.M. In Vitro ( Rockville ). 1978; 14: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Culture plates were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells (passages 3–15) were subcultured after treatment with 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm disodium EDTA. BAEC were identified by their maintenance of density-dependent growth after serial passage, by their typical cobblestone configuration when viewed by light microscopy, and by a positive indirect immunofluorescence for von Willebrand factor (20Haudenschild C.C. Zahniser D. Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 21Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin.

BAEC were plated onto 20 × 100-mm Falcon 3003 tissue culture dishes and allowed to reach confluency over 5–7 days. All experiments were initiated with phenol red-free medium containing 1 mml-arginine. Experimental groups consisted of cells treated with no additional thiols (controls) or with Hcy or Cys at concentrations ranging from 20 μm to 5 mm. The production of total NO x (S-nitrosothiols plus free NO) was measured by photolysis/chemiluminescence as described previously (23Welch G.N. Upchurch Jr., G.R. Loscalzo J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) withS-nitrosoglutathione used as a standard. All measured NO x is expressed as nmol of NO x /g of cell protein. Nitric-oxide synthase activity was measured in endothelial cell lysates following 4-h incubations with or without Hcy using the method of Bredt and Snyder (24Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (3128) Google Scholar). Activity is expressed as fmol ofl-citrulline/g of cell protein. Confluent BAEC treated with various concentrations of Hcy for 4 h were harvested by scraping and frozen at −70 °C. Upon thawing, the cell pellets were homogenized in a buffer containing 0.32 mm sucrose, 0.020 mm Hepes, 0.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (1000 × g for 10 min at 2 °C), and a sample of each treatment group was used for total protein determination. Prior to loading, each sample was denatured by boiling in the dithiothreitol-containing homogenization buffer for 2 min. Each sample was loaded onto a 4% stacking/7.5% separating gel at equal protein concentrations and electrophoresed at a constant current at 4 °C. After transferring the gel using standard Western blotting techniques, the blot was incubated in a 5% milk suspension for 2 h to block nonspecific binding sites. The blot was then exposed to a human monoclonal antibody to eNOS (1:2000 dilution; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). The ECL Western blot analysis system (Amersham Life Systems, Buckinghamshire, England) was used for detection of the primary antibody signal and included a peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000). The immunoreactivity of eNOS was detected by changes in chemiluminescence. After transfer to an autoradiogram, the eNOS signal was quantified by densitometry. Cell monolayers of ∼1.1 × 107 cells were grown to subconfluency. Total RNA was isolated from monolayers of BAEC treated for 4 h with or without exogenous Hcy. Total RNA was extracted using the Oncogene Science RNA purification system, which is based on a guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method. nos3 mRNA was detected by Northern analysis using a full-length cDNA derived from a bovine clone kindly provided by Drs. Thomas Michel and Santiago Lamas (GenBank™ accession numberM89952) (25Lamas S. Marsden P.A. Li G.K. Tempst P. Michel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6348-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Ten μg of total RNA were loaded in each lane and electrophoresed on a denaturing 1.2% agarose gel containing 2.2m formaldehyde. The gel was blotted onto a Nytron-N+ membrane by capillary action, hybridized with the32P-radiolabeled probes for nos3 and bovine β-actin (generous gift of Dr. David R. Morris), and then exposed on Kodak X-Omat film for 3 days at −70 °C. For quantitative evaluation of nos3 and β-actin transcripts, phosphoimage analysis was performed using a PhosphorImager SF (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The blots were repeated and analyzed in triplicate for each of the experimental groups. In separate experiments, subconfluent HMVEC were exposed to control medium, to medium containing Hcy, or to medium containing Cys, each for 4 h. HMVEC were used in these experiments because the human GPx probe did not recognize the bovine intracellular GPx mRNA. Total cellular RNA was extracted from HMVEC, and 10 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a 1.5% denaturing agarose gel and blotted as described above. The full-length human GPx cDNA probe (1.1 kb) was the generous gift of Dr. Peter Newburger (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA). Hybridization was performed according to the method described by Chada et al. (26Chada S. Le Beau M.M. Casey L. Newburger P.E. Genomics. 1990; 6: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) with phosphoimage data obtained after overnight exposure. GPx transcription was normalized by comparison with β-actin as described above. In separate experiments, HMVEC were treated with or without Hcy for 4 h in the presence of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Total mRNA was collected at 0, 1, 2, and 4 h, and Northern analyses using the GPx and β-actin probes were performed as described above. In these experiments, β-MSA, an inhibitor of intracellular GPx (27Chaudiere J. Wilhelmsen E.C. Tappel A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1043-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was incubated with BAEC in the presence of Hcy. BAEC were incubated with 100 μm Hcy, 100 μmβ-MSA, both, or neither for 4 h, and media were collected and assayed for NO x as described above. Intracellular GPx activity was determined by an assay that couples the reduction of peroxides and the oxidation of glutathione with the reduction of oxidized glutathione by glutathione reductase using NADPH as a cofactor. Hydroperoxide reduction was followed by a decrease in NADPH absorbance at 340 nm (28Freedman J.E. Frei B. Welch G.N. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC were treated with control medium or with medium containing Hcy. After 4 h, the cells were washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution and treated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100. Hydroperoxide reduction was monitored as a decrease in light absorbance with oxidation of NADPH at 340 nm. Results are given in absorbance units/min/mg of protein and represent the averages of seven experiments, each performed in duplicate. Intracellular GSH was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with electrochemical detection (23Welch G.N. Upchurch Jr., G.R. Loscalzo J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 268: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The technique reliably separates and detects thiols in the nm range and readily distinguishes the various biological thiols from one another. In these experiments, cells were exposed to control medium or to medium containing Hcy. After 4 h, BAEC were washed with Hanks' balanced saline solution and treated with 0.4 n perchloric acid containing 2 mm DTPA. Intracellular glutathione levels were determined by HPLC/electrochemical detection and normalized to total cell protein. Cell viability of confluent monolayers was determined by one of three methods. At the end of each treatment, cells were examined by light microscopy for vacuolation and other signs of cell death. Treated cells were also compared with control cells using trypan blue exclusion. Total lactate dehydrogenase in the medium was quantified spectrophotometrically. Using light microscopy, trypan blue, and lactate dehydrogenase, no significant differences were appreciated at 4 h between the control group and cells treated with up to 5.0 mm Hcy. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test or an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with either a Bonferroni or a Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. p values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. BAEC were incubated with media containing a range of concentrations of Hcy for 4 h, the media were collected, and NO x concentrations were determined. Fig. 1 shows the average of five experiments, each performed in triplicate. The data demonstrate that BAEC incubated with increasing concentrations of Hcy sustained a dose-dependent decrease in NO x (p = 0.001 by ANOVA). Compared with control cells (106 ± 8 nmol of NO x /g of protein), treatment of BAEC with Hcy led to a maximum 86% reduction (15 ± 3 nmol of NO x /g of cell protein) in NO x . Cys, at similar concentrations, failed to produce a statistically significant decrease in NO x (data not shown). Having shown a maximum 86% decrease in NO x after treatment of BAEC with Hcy, we next attempted to determine if this decrease in NO x was the result of an alteration in eNOS activity or protein levels or steady-statenos3 mRNA. Lysates of BAEC following a 4-h incubation with 0, 0.05, or 5 mm Hcy showed no significant change in eNOS activity (138 ± 22, 150 ± 40, and 155 ± 35 fmol of l-citrulline/g of cell protein, respectively;p = not significant). Western analysis was performed on BAEC incubated with medium containing 0, 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mmHcy for 4 h. Following a 4-h incubation, BAEC eNOS protein levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In contrast to NO x, cells incubated with increasing concentrations of Hcy manifested no detectable reduction in eNOS protein compared with control cells (Fig. 2 A). We also examined steady-state nos3 mRNA in BAEC after cell treatment either with control medium (Fig. 2 B,CON) or with medium containing 5.0 mm Hcy (HCY) for 4 h. Fig. 2 B is one of three Northern blots of BAEC total RNA probed with a bovine full-lengthnos3 cDNA and a bovine β-actin cDNA (4.5 and 2 kb, respectively). Quantitative results from densitometric analysis of Northern phosphoimages show that, in the presence of 5.0 mmHcy, steady-state nos3 mRNA was not statistically different from control levels after normalizing for β-actin (p = not significant; n = 3). Recent evidence from our laboratory suggests that GPx potentiates the action of NO produced by BAEC and does so by a mechanism that requires glutathione as a cosubstrate (28Freedman J.E. Frei B. Welch G.N. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on this observation, which suggests that a decrease in intracellular GPx may cause a decrease in bioavailable NO, we tested the hypothesis that Hcy causes a reduction in NO by impairing the reduction of peroxides by endothelial GPx. In initial experiments, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of GPx potentiates the decrease in endothelial NO x produced by Hcy oxidation. In these experiments, BAEC were incubated with 100 μm Hcy, 100 μm β-MSA, both, or neither for 4 h, and total NO x production was determined. The results show that cells treated with β-MSA and Hcy sustained a 88% reduction in NO x compared with control cells (Fig.3). After showing that the addition of β-MSA to BAEC in the presence of Hcy potentiated the decrease in NO x observed when cells were treated with Hcy alone, we next attempted to determine if Hcy, a known generator of H2O2, might lead to a decrease in intracellular GPx activity. Intracellular endothelial GPx activity was measured following a 4-h incubation with increasing concentrations of Hcy. Compared with control levels (0.16 ± 0.04 absorbance units/min/mg of protein), pathophysiological concentrations of Hcy (50–250 μm) led to a 41–81% decrease (0.095 ± 0.03 to 0.03 ± 0.01 absorbance units/min/mg of protein at 50 and 250 μm Hcy, respectively; p < 0.001) in GPx activity (Fig. 4). Higher concentrations of Hcy (1 mm) reduced GPx activity by 91% compared with control levels (0.014 ± 0.005 absorbance units/min/mg of protein;p < 0.001). In separate experiments in which a known concentration of exogenous GPx (200 units/ml) was added to the medium for 4 h, increasing concentrations of Hcy did not alter the enzyme activity compared with control levels (p = 0.64 by ANOVA) (data not shown). This finding suggests that the effect of Hcy on endogenous GPx is not direct and instead occurs either through an attenuation of GPx expression or through reduced availability of cosubstrate GSH. In an attempt to determine if Hcy modified GPx activity by altering transcription of GPx, Northern analysis was performed on total cellular mRNA after HMVEC were treated with control medium or with medium containing either 5.0 mm Hcy or Cys. Steady-state GPx mRNA in cells treated with 5.0 mm Hcy was decreased significantly (by 90%) compared with control cells (Fig.5). By contrast and importantly, cells treated with 5.0 mm Cys showed no change in steady-state GPx mRNA compared with control cells, possibly explaining in part why Cys treatment of BAEC induces no change in NO x production despite the similar generation of H2O2 during Cys oxidation. After demonstrating a decrease in steady-state GPx mRNA following Hcy incubation, we next attempted to determine if the effect of Hcy on GPx mRNA affected transcription or message stability. The results from actinomycin D treatment of HMVEC concomitant with Hcy incubation are shown in Fig. 6 and demonstrate no change in steady-state GPx mRNA over the time course of this experiment. These results suggests that Hcy treatment of HMVEC alters GPx mRNA transcription and does not destabilize mRNA. Having demonstrated a decrease in intracellular GPx activity as well as GPx transcription following Hcy exposure, we next addressed the issue of whether or not the reduction in GPx activity might also be secondary to a limited cosubstrate (GSH). We found that BAEC respond to increasing concentrations of Hcy by increasing GSH. As shown in Table I, BAEC exposed to 50 μm Hcy or 5.0 mm Hcy showed increases in intracellular GSH of 32 and 132%, respectively, compared with control cells (p < 0.05).Table IHomocysteine and endothelial cell GSHTreatmentGSHGSHμmol/g protein% controlControl2.96 ± 0.51Hcy 50 μm3.91 ± 0.6132 5.0 mm6.87 ± 0.611-ap < 0.05 compared with control and 50 μm Hcy.1321-a p < 0.05 compared with control and 50 μm Hcy. Open table in a new tab Lactate dehydrogenase released from BAEC treated for 4 h with control medium or with medium containing 5.0 mm Hcy was next measured and compared with total cell lactate dehydrogenase (0.1% Triton X-100). Compared with control medium, BAEC treated with medium containing 5.0 mm Hcy for 4 h showed no increase in lactate dehydrogenase release (511 ± 46 units/ml for controlversus 513 ± 62 units/ml for 5.0 mm Hcy;p = not significant). Cells treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 served as a positive control. We first showed that Hcy, a thiol known to generate H2O2, decreases bioavailable NO independent of eNOS protein expression and steady-state nos3 mRNA. In this study, we also demonstrate that inhibition of intracellular GPx can potentiate the deleterious effects of Hcy by leading to a further decrease in bioactive NO. Subsequently, we examined the effects of increasing concentrations of Hcy on intracellular endothelial GPx and thiol pools (GSH). In this study, Hcy treatment of BAEC reduced intracellular GPx activity and transcription in a manner that is not the consequence of a direct effect on GPx activity or a consequence of limited cosubstrate (GSH). These observations suggest that Hcy, in addition to causing endothelial cell injury by promoting the formation of peroxides, also reduces intracellular levels of GPx and thereby potentiates inactivation of NO by peroxides. Earlier work by Starkebaum and Harlan (29Starkebaum G. Harlan J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1370-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) and Wall et al.(30Wall R.T. Harlan J.M. Harker L.A. Striker G.E. Thromb. Res. 1980; 18: 113-121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) demonstrated in vitro that Hcy undergoes oxidation to homocystine, and in the process, H2O2 is generated. In these experiments, catalase prevented Hcy-induced endothelial cell injury. These authors concluded that Hcy-induced endothelial cell injury in vitro was largely secondary to H2O2 generation. Harker et al. (31Harker L.A. Ross R. Slichter S.J. Scott C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 731-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) postulated that Hcy-induced H2O2-mediated endothelial cytotoxicity led to the exposure of the smooth muscle cell-containing vascular medium. Once exposed, the vascular smooth muscle cells begin to proliferate and to evoke other deleterious effects, including the activation of platelets and leukocytes. In addition to the generation of H2O2, Hcy may also play a role in inducing endothelial cytotoxicity by producing other reactive oxygen species. Superoxide anion radical (O·̄2), a potent reactive oxygen free radical generated following the oxidation of Hcy, has been shown to cause lipid peroxidation (32Heinecke J.W. Oxy-radicals in Molecular Biology and Pathology. Alan R. Liss, New York1988Google Scholar). Hcy is not unique in its ability to generate H2O2 or superoxide, as other thiols can generate these oxidative by-products as well. Heinecke et al. (33Heinecke J.W. Rosen H. Suzuki L.A. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10098-10103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also shown that supplementation of the biological thiol Cys leads to an increase in superoxide production by smooth muscle cells. In distinct contrast to Hcy, we found that Cys was unable to decrease bioavailable NO or to cause a significant decrease in steady-state GPx mRNA in this system. We further speculate that variations in the reduced state of the various thiols may be important in determining the selective toxicity of Hcy compared with other biological thiols. Andersson et al. (34Andersson A. Lindgren A. Hultberg B. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) showed that Hcy, similar to GSH, has a t½ in plasma of ∼14 min, while the t½ of Cys is almost three times longer (37 min). The differences in the t½ of the structurally similar reduced biological thiols, which are both capable of being oxidized, suggest that the mechanism behind the respective oxidation of each thiol must differ in some manner. The cell protects itself against oxidative damage from H2O2 by two separate intracellular enzyme systems, GPx and catalase. GPx, containing a selenocysteine moiety in its catalytic center, is an antioxidant enzyme that reduces both lipid and hydrogen peroxide to their respective alcohols. In contrast, catalase is a ubiquitous enzyme that scavenges H2O2 exclusively. Compared with GPx, catalase is found in lower concentrations intracellularly and has a higherK m for hydrogen peroxide (35Asahi M. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Seo H.G. Kuzuya T. Hori M. Tada M. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21035-21039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), further implicating GPx as the major intracellular detoxifying mechanism for H2O2 and lipid peroxides. A number of studies have documented a link between differences in GPx and an increased incidence of atherosclerosis. Buczynski et al. (36Buczynski A. Wachowicz B. Kedziora-Kornatowska K. Tkaczewski W. Kedziora J. Atherosclerosis. 1993; 100: 223-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) have shown that patients with coronary artery disease have lower platelet and plasma levels of GPx. Other investigators have shown that a selenium-deficient diet leads to a decrease in the GPx level (37Avissar N. Whitin J.C. Allen P.Z. Palmer I.S. Cohen H.J. Blood. 1989; 73: 318-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and consequently an increase in the incidence of coronary artery disease (38Salonen J.T. Alfthan G. Huttunen J.K. Pikkarainen J. Puska P. Lancet. 1982; 2: 175-179Abstract PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). In addition, certain diets containing ω3-polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have been shown to reduce cardiovascular disease, are also rich in selenium, further implying a role for GPx in preventing atherosclerosis (39Gabrielsen B.O. Opstvedt J. J. Nutr. 1980; 110: 1096-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A recent study by our laboratory has suggested that GPx might also be important in the regulation of NO, a potent inhibitor of platelet activation (28Freedman J.E. Frei B. Welch G.N. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 394-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our data support a dual role for GPx: first, by reducing lipid peroxides, GPx prevents the inactivation of NO; and second, GPx also preserves the antiplatelet effects of an endogenous NO donor, S-nitrosoglutathione. These data suggest that this latter effect of GPx is secondary to the ability ofS-nitrosoglutathione to serve as an effective cosubstrate for GPx in place of GSH. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that if GPx protects bioactive NO from oxidative attack, then the corollary might also be true, viz. a decrease in GPx might lead to a decrease in bioavailable NO. The thrombogenic mechanism(s) involved in hyperhomocyst(e)inemia are not well understood, yet data from our laboratory and others suggest that the ability of Hcy to damage the endothelium and to support atherothrombosis may be multifactorial, with different and specific effects on both endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. For example, Hcy at doses of 0.1–1.0 mm markedly inhibits endothelial cell growth over time in vitro; in contrast, vascular smooth muscle cells respond to similar concentrations of Hcy with an increase in cyclin D1 and cyclin A mRNA expression and a resulting marked increase in cell proliferation (40Tsai J.C. Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Hsieh C.M. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6369-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Hcy first produces severe endothelial cell injury and that this injury, in turn, leads to platelet activation (induced by reducing endothelium-derived relaxing factor/NO production), smooth muscle cell proliferation, and subsequent thrombosis. These effects stand in direct contrast to the known effects of NO on smooth muscle and endothelial cell growth: NO (produced by nos2 in vascular smooth muscle cells) is cytotoxic to smooth muscle cells, yet leads in co-culture to endothelial cell proliferation, perhaps by release of basic fibroblast growth factor (41Fukuo K. Inoue T. Morimoto S. Nakahashi T. Yasuda O. Kitano S. Sasada R. Ogihara T. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and/or vascular endothelial cell growth factor from smooth muscle cells. Our data support this proposed mechanism of Hcy toxicity and suggest that Hcy-induced attenuation of bioavailable NO compromises the antithrombotic properties of the endothelium and predisposes to platelet activation as well as thrombin generation. Recent observations from our laboratory suggest that, through enhanced NO release, the endothelium can modify the toxicity of Hcy for a limited time (19Schwartz S.M. In Vitro ( Rockville ). 1978; 14: 966-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). However, as GPx expression decreases and the oxidative by-products of Hcy begin to accumulate, endothelial dysfunction occurs, leading to subsequent attenuation of NO production. Eventually, a progressive imbalance between NO production by an increasingly dysfunctional endothelium and an increase in Hcy and its oxidative by-products develops. As recently demonstrated by Lentz et al. (42Lentz S.R. Sobey C.G. Piegors D.J. Bhopatkar M.Y. Faraci F.M. Malinow M.R. Heistad D.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1966; 98: 24-29Crossref Scopus (487) Google Scholar), this deficiency of bioactive NO produced by dysfunctional endothelium leads to impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in a monkey model. These data suggest that hyperhomocyst(e)inemia limits the bioavailability of endothelium-derived relaxing factor/NO through a mechanism that involves the increased production of reactive oxygen species coupled to an impaired ability to detoxify peroxides. Future therapeutic strategies designed to stimulate endogenous NO production, to provide exogenous NO donors, or to improve the antioxidant profile of the vasculature may help to ameliorate endothelial cell injury evoked by hyperhomocyst(e)inemia. We express our appreciation to Drs. Audrey Rudd and Glenn Shwaery for assistance in isolating endothelial cells and Caroline Alpert and Joshua Zuckerman for excellent technical assistance. We are grateful to Stephanie Tribuna for assistance in the preparation of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2007555056,"Phorbol ester tumor promoters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), are potent activators of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2), stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in U937 human leukemic cells. These kinases are regulated by the reversible dual phosphorylation of conserved threonine and tyrosine residues. The dual specificity protein phosphatase MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) has been shown to dephosphorylate and inactivate ERK2, SAPK, and p38 MAPK in transient transfection studies. Here we demonstrate that PMA treatment induces MKP-1 protein expression in U937 cells, which is detectable within 30 min with maximal levels attained after 4 h. This time course coincides with the rapid inactivation of PMA-induced SAPK activity, but not ERK2 phosphorylation, which remains elevated for up to 6 h. To examine directly the role of MKP-1 in the regulation of these protein kinases <i>in vivo</i>, we established a U937 cell line that conditionally expresses MKP-1 from the human metallothionein IIa promoter. Conditional expression of MKP-1 inhibited PMA-induced ERK2, SAPK, and p38 MAPK activity. By titrating the levels of MKP-1 expression from the human metallothionein IIa promoter, however, it was found that p38 MAPK and SAPK were much more sensitive to inhibition by MKP-1 than ERK2. This differential substrate specificity of MKP-1 can be functionally extended to nuclear transcriptional events in that PMA-induced c-Jun transcriptional activity was more sensitive to inhibition by MKP-1 than either Elk-1 or c-Myc. Conditional expression of MKP-1 also abolished the induction of endogenous MKP-1 protein expression in response to PMA treatment. This negative feedback regulatory mechanism is likely due to MKP-1-mediated inhibition of ERK2, as studies utilizing the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 suggest that ERK2 activation is required for PMA-induced MKP-1 expression. These findings suggest that ERK2-mediated induction of MKP-1 may play an important role in preferentially attenuating signaling through the p38 MAPK and SAPK signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1999841046,"The proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (EC) is an important event in angiogenesis. The synthesis of the EC growth factor, vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), is stimulated by a variety of activators; but the effects of important vasoactive peptides are not well understood, and there are no known natural inhibitors of VEGF production. We found that the vasoactive peptides endothelin (ET)-1 and ET-3 stimulated the synthesis of VEGF protein 3–4-fold in cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells, comparable in magnitude to hypoxia.

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), C-type natriuretic peptide, and C-ANP-(4–23), a ligand for the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor, equipotently inhibited production of VEGF by as much as 88% and inhibited ET- or hypoxia-stimulated VEGF transcription. EC proliferation and invasion of matrix were stimulated by VEGF secreted into the medium by ET-incubated vascular smooth muscle cells. This was inhibited by ANP.

Our results identify the natriuretic peptides as the first peptide inhibitors of VEGF synthesis and indicate a novel mechanism by which vasoactive peptides could modulate angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a multistep process that results in the formation of new capillaries, usually by sprouting from pre-existing small blood vessels (1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The impetus for vascular remodeling arises during both physiologic and pathophysiologic events. These include embryonic development, wound healing or tissue regeneration, and tumor growth (2Folkman J. Klagsbrun M. Science. 1987; 235: 442-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (4055) Google Scholar). In each of these processes, the invasion of the perivascular extracellular matrix and the migration and proliferation of endothelial cells (EC) 1The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell(s); bFGF, basic fibroblast growth factor; VSMC, vascular smooth muscle cell(s); VEGF, vascular endothelial cell growth factor; ET, endothelin(s); ANP, atrial natriuretic peptide; CNP, C-type natriuretic peptide; NP, natriuretic peptide(s); hUVSMC, human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells; kb, kilobase(s); Luc, luciferase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PKC, protein kinase C. occur as steps in angiogenesis and result in part from the action of EC-directed growth factors. The normally quiescent microvasculature has a turnover time for endothelial cells extending to years. However, when angiogenesis is enacted by EC growth factors, proliferation of EC can be accomplished in as short as 5 days (1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the modulation of specific growth factor production is important to the invasion properties, proliferation, and migration of EC. Several vascular growth factors have been implicated as playing an important role in these phases of angiogenesis, including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF), angiogenin, and platelet-derived growth factor (1Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Klagsbrun M. D'Amore P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 217-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Recently, a peptide growth/permeability factor has been identified that is produced predominantly in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and binds to the specific receptors Flt1 and Flk1 (KDR), expressed mainly on EC (4Ferrara N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1993; 3: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). This protein, vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF), has been implicated in the stimulation of normal angiogenesis and the increased capillary formation that characterizes proliferative diabetic retinopathy (5Aiello L.P. Avery R.L. Arrigg P.G. Keyt B.A. Jampel H.D. Shah S.T. Pasquale L.R. Thieme H. Iwamoto M.A. Park J.E. Nguyen H.V. Aiello L.M. Ferrara N. King G.L. N. Engl. J.

VEGF production is stimulated under a variety of circumstances, most notably by tissue hypoxia (12Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J. Biol.

One family of vasoactive peptides, the endothelins (ET), are produced primarily in EC, but also in VSMC (14Levin E.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and are known todirectly stimulate EC proliferation in vitro, modulated through the endothelin B-type (ETB) receptor (15Morbidelli L. Orlando C. Maggi C.A. Ledda F. Ziche M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H686-H695PubMed Google Scholar). Another family, the natriuretic peptides, are produced in both the heart and EC (16DeBold A.J. Borenstein H.B. Veress A.T. Sonnenberg H. Life Sci. 1981; 28: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2664) Google Scholar, 17Suga S.-i. Nakao K. Itoh H. Komatsu Y. Ogawa Y. Hama N. Imura H. J. Clin.

Hypertension. 1992; 19: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We investigated whether ET and ANP might regulate the production of VEGF as a potentially important mechanism by which these peptides could modulate important steps for the process of angiogenesis. We also sought to understand which receptors could mediate vasoactive peptide regulation of VEGF production and what signaling mechanisms are involved. We report that members of the ET family that are produced in the vasculature, ET-1 and ET-3, are potent stimulators of VEGF production. More important, members of the natriuretic family, ANP and CNP, substantially inhibit VEGF production and subsequent key steps of angiogenesis in two models that simulate the in vivo interactions of VEGF with EC. Bovine aortic EC cultures were prepared as described previously (19Hu R.M. Levin E.R. Pedram A. Frank H.J.L. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 20Hu R.-M. Levin E.R. Pedram A. Frank H.J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17384-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bovine aortic EC were plated into 100-mm culture dishes as primary cultures. After confluency, the cells were replated in various sized culture dishes depending on the experimental protocol. The cells displayed the typical morphologic characteristics of endothelial cells, and virtually all cells showed positive fluorescence with an antibody to factor VIII. For human umbilical vein smooth muscle cells (hUVSMC), the preparation and plating of cells were similar except that fetal umbilical veins were obtained immediately after birth and perfused with iced saline, and lumens were stripped of the endothelial layer by 30 min of incubation in collagenase-containing medium. This was followed by rinsing and additional exposure to collagenase for 2 h to obtain smooth muscle cells (21Frank H.J.L. Levin E.R. Hu R.-M. Pedram A. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 1092-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The cells had the typical appearance of smooth muscle cells and did not stain positive for Von Willebrand's factor, but were found to stain for α-actin. hUVSMC were synchronized in the absence of serum for 24 h and then incubated in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with dialyzed 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h prior to experimentation (19Hu R.M.

Chem. 1992; 267: 17384-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were then incubated with 250 μCi of [35S]methionine in the presence or absence of ET-1 or ET-3 (1 or 100 nm) or ANP, CNP, or C-ANP-(4–23) (1 or 100 nm) for various times over 6 h. In some wells, BQ-123, a specific endothelin A-type (ETA) receptor antagonist, or IRL-1038 (both from Peninsula Laboratories, Inc.), a specific ETB receptor antagonist, was added (22Rubanyi G.M. Polokoff M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 328-415Google Scholar). Other dishes of cells were placed in an anaerobic chamber (Gas Pack system, Becton Dickinson), which was purged with 95% N2 and 5% CO2 and sealed with an O2-consuming palladium catalyst. This created hypoxic conditions of PO2at 35 mm Hg. The control cells were subjected to normoxia (atmospheric air and 5% CO2; PO2 at 150 mm Hg). The media from the experimental conditions were saved, and the cells were washed and then lysed in buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate and secretion medium were precleared, and labeled VEGF protein was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal antibody to VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody that was preabsorbed with recombinant VEGF (10−7m; Merck) for 12 h prior to the immunoprecipitation procedure served as a specificity control. The immunoprecipitated protein was solubilized in reducing SDS sample buffer, denatured, and resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was subjected to fluorography and then autoradiography for 1–2 days. Each translation experiment was performed at least three times. The extracted RNA was hybridized with a 32P-labeled cRNA probe, made from a template of a full-length human cDNA for VEGF (kindly provided by Dr. Richard Kendall, Merck) (23Conn G. Bayne M.L.

The cDNA was in anEcoRI-EcoRI orientation in pGEM33zf and was linearized with NcoI; antisense and sense cRNA probes were promoted using SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases, respectively. A transcript of ∼400 bases was protected. Solution hybridization, S1 nuclease digestion, and electrophoretic separation were carried out as described previously (19Hu R.M. Levin E.R. Pedram A.

Autoradiographic bands were compared by laser densitometry (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Sense probes produced no hybridization, and the studies were repeated three times. VSMC were grown to 40–50% confluence on 60-mm Petri dishes. Cells were then transiently transfected as described previously (24Biesiada E. Razandi M. Levin E.R. J. Biol.

To control for transfection efficiency, cells were cotransfected with 0.1 μg of pRL-SV40 expressing theRenilla luciferase (Promega), and VEGF/Luc data were accordingly normalized. Cells were incubated with LipofectAMINE reagent (8 μl/plate; Life Technologies, Inc.) and DNA complexes for 5 h at 37 °C, followed by recovery for 12 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to experimental treatment, cells were synchronized for 24 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were then treated with hypoxia, ET-1 or ET-3 (100 nm) ± ANP (100 nm), or ANP alone for 6 h at 37 °C, followed by harvesting. Some dishes of cells were incubated with ET-1 and the MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD 98059 (20 μm) (26Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Cell extracts were briefly microcentrifuged, and supernatants were assayed for luciferase activity by the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Experiments were carried out four times, each condition in triplicate in each experiment, and all data were combined. hUVSMC were first incubated in the presence or absence of ET-1 or ET-3 and in the presence or absence of ANP for 4 h, and the secretion medium was then aspirated and frozen for subsequent use. Some of the ET-1-incubated VSMC medium was then absorbed with antibody (1:1000 dilution) to VEGF or bFGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or ET-1 (Peninsula Laboratories, Inc.) for 2 h prior to use with EC. Subconfluent EC were synchronized by incubation for 24 h in serum-free medium. The cells were then incubated for 20 h in the absence or presence of the various experimental secretion media from the VSMC experiments. This was followed by the addition of 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine for an additional 4 h as described previously (28Levin E.R. Frank H.J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R453-R457PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were then washed, incubated for 10 min with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C to precipitate the nuclear incorporated thymidine, washed twice, and lysed with 0.2 m NaOH, and the lysates were neutralized with 0.2 n HCl and counted in a liquid scintillation β-counter. To understand the intracellular signal that is necessary for ET modulation of VEGF protein production, VSMC were incubated with ET-1 or ET-3 for 4 h in the presence or absence of the PKC inhibitor calphostin C. VEGF protein synthesis was carried out as described above, and the intracellular lysates were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and characterized. To assess whether the guanylate cyclase receptors and cGMP mediate the actions of ANP or CNP, the cells were incubated with ET and the NP with or without the compound LY 53853, an antagonist of ANP-stimulated cGMP generation (29Razandi M. Pedram A. Rubin T. Levin E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1342-H1349PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF protein synthesis was again determined. The generation of cGMP in whole cells was determined in response to the NP. VSMC cultures in 12-well plates were synchronized for 24 h at 37 °C in culture medium without fetal bovine serum. The cells (in quadruplicate wells/condition) were preincubated for 5 min with 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and then incubated for an additional 5 min with ANP or CNP (100 nm). The reactions were stopped on ice with immediate aspiration of the medium, followed by three washes of the cells with cold Hanks' balanced saline solution. Cyclic nucleotides were extracted and assayed as described previously (29Razandi M. Pedram A. Rubin T. Levin E.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1342-H1349PubMed Google Scholar). VSMC secretion medium was obtained from cells incubated with ET-1, ANP, or ET plus ANP for 4 h as described for the proliferation studies. To examine the “paracrine” chemoattractant effects of the VSMC incubation medium on EC invasion of matrix, a standard invasion assay was used (30Chu Y.-W. Runyan R.B. Oshima R.G. Hendrix J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4261-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The medium from each VSMC experimental condition was added to the bottom of 24-well Falcon TC companion plates. Matrigel invasion chambers and control inserts (Becton Dickinson) were placed inside each of the wells; the chamber contained a thin Matrigel layer on top of an 8-μm membrane pore, and EC were seeded at a density of 105 cells/ml into the chamber on top of the membrane, where they were incubated for 12 h at 37 °C. After incubation, the non-invading cells adhering to the upper surface of the membrane were scraped away, and invasion was detected after staining by counting the cells under the microscope in the center fields of the underlayer of the membrane. The 12 h of incubation precluded cell proliferation as contributing to the differences in invasion number since the doubling time of these cells is ∼24 h. Triplicate membranes were assessed per VSMC media experimental condition, and the data were normalized for invasion through a control membrane. The normalized data were compared with invasion of EC through membranes incubated in the presence of control VSMC medium (no peptides added to the incubation medium). Under some conditions, the incubation medium from ET-1-incubated VSMC was preabsorbed with VEGF, bFGF, or ET-1 antibody as described for the proliferation studies. Protein bands from the translation studies were compared by laser densitometry. RNA comparisons were quantified by laser densitometry of autoradiographs, and data were normalized for RNA loading by creating a ratio of the density of the experimental RNA hybridized with the VEGF probe divided by the same amount of RNA hybridized with β-actin. A ratio was then established by comparing normalized experimental RNA with normalized control RNA that was extracted from untreated endothelial cells. A value of 1 was arbitrarily assigned to the control. This resulted in values expressing the relative densities of the experimental conditions compared with the control. Data from multiple experiments for the thymidine incorporation or cGMP generation studies were combined, and the different conditions were compared by analysis of variance; a multiple range test (Scheffe's F test) was used for significant F values (p < 0.05), and the Statview statistical computer program was used (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Transcription and invasion data were similarly analyzed. ET-1 or ET-3 caused a significant increase in the production of new VEGF protein in VSMC (Fig.1 A). Based on data from three experiments, ET-3 stimulated this growth factor's production, beginning at 1 h and maximally stimulating VEGF protein production by 2.5 ± 0.2-fold above base line at 4 h. ET-1 also stimulated the production of VEGF by 1 h of incubation and maximally by 3.5 ± 0.4-fold above control levels at 6 h of incubation. Stimulation by the ET peptides was comparable in magnitude and time course to the stimulation of VEGF production produced by hypoxia, a recognized potent and important stimulus of VEGF production (Fig. 1 A). The predominant form of this protein produced in the cell and isolated from the intracellular lysate was compatible with VEGF165. This isoform is a 45-kDa homodimeric glycoprotein, which should migrate on gel in its reduced (monomeric) form at ∼20–23 kDa (31Ferrara N. Winer J. Burton T. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), depending upon the degree of glycosylation by the cell. VEGF165 is the most abundant form detected in VSMC and is known to be one of two forms secreted by these cells (31Ferrara N. Winer J. Burton T. Growth Factors. 1991; 5: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The other isoforms of VEGF (VEGF206, VEGF189, and VEGF121) (32Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.-J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4466) Google Scholar) were not seen in our experiments using the cell lysate. Antibody that was first preabsorbed with this growth factor failed to precipitate the band (Fig. 1 B). The ability of ET-1 and ET-3 to stimulate VEGF production was concentration-related (Fig.1 B). The ET peptides also caused a comparable, dose-related stimulation of VEGF165 secretion into the cell incubation medium (Fig. 1 C). More important, ANP inhibited the ET-stimulated production and secretion of VEGF (Fig. 1 (Band C) and text below) in a concentration-dependent fashion. We then investigated the ET receptors involved in the regulation of VEGF production. After 6 h of incubation, the stimulation by ET-1 was reversed 91% by the ETA receptor antagonist BQ-123 (Fig.2, lane 5 versus lane 13), indicating that ET-1 stimulated VEGF production after binding the ETA receptor. In contrast, ET-3 stimulation of this growth factor was antagonized 93% by IRL-1038 (lanes 9 and 14), but not by BQ-123 (lane 15), indicating that the ETB receptor mediated these effects. These results also indicate that either of the two known human ET receptor subtypes has the capability to signal to the program for VEGF production. We then further examined the interaction between the NP and ET and found that two naturally occurring and one synthetic NP inhibited ET-stimulated VEGF production (Fig. 2). ANP, CNP, and C-ANP-(4–23) also inhibited the hypoxia-augmented VEGF protein synthesis. The effects were potent, with ANP causing a 77 ± 6% maximal inhibition of ET- stimulated VEGF synthesis and 88 ± 3% inhibition of hypoxic action. Each of the three NP were approximately equipotent in their effects, within 4% of each other based upon combined data from three studies. ET signals through several G proteins to multiple effectors, resulting in a variety of cell physiologic effects (14Levin E.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1995; 333: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Several important functions of ET appear to involve protein kinase C. Based on three experiments, we found that the ability of ET-1 or ET-3 to stimulate VEGF protein synthesis was reversed 48 and 32%, respectively, by co-incubation with calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor (33Svetlov S. Nigam S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1177: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, lane 6 versus lane 11 and lane 12 versus lane 17). This indicates that signaling through this serine/threonine kinase is an important mediator for ET-induced VEGF production, but also that PKC-independent pathways or PKC isoforms that are not inhibited by calphostin C are probably involved. We also determined whether the effects of ANP or CNP are mediated through cGMP generation, indicating involvement of the guanylate cyclase A and B receptors, respectively. Inhibition by ANP or CNP of ET-stimulated VEGF averaged 64 ± 5%, based on combined data. We found that co-incubation of the NP with 1 μm LY 53853 had little effect on ANP or CNP inhibition of ET-stimulated VEGF protein synthesis (Fig. 3, lanes 6–10 and 12–16). This suggests that the generation of cGMP does not mediate the inhibitory effects of ANP or CNP. LY 53853 at this concentration was capable, however, of dose-dependently and significantly inhibiting the ANP- or CNP-stimulated production of cGMP. The natriuretic peptides caused a 250–300% stimulation of cGMP generation above control levels (Table I). This was maximally inhibited by 1 μm LY 53853: 57 and 54% for ANP and CNP, respectively. Although the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor ligand C-ANP-(4–23) was equipotent to ANP or CNP in inhibiting VEGF production (Fig. 2), this compound did not generate cGMP in limited studies and as we have previously shown (20Hu R.-M.

https://openalex.org/W2060807115,"The determination of protein nitrotyrosine content has become a frequently used technique for the detection of oxidative tissue damage. Protein nitration has been suggested to be a final product of the production of highly reactive nitrogen oxide intermediates (e.g. peroxynitrite) formed in reactions between nitric oxide (NO⋅) and oxygen-derived species such as superoxide. The enzyme prostaglandin H synthase-2 (PHS-2) forms one or more tyrosyl radicals during its enzymatic catalysis of prostaglandin formation. In the presence of the NO⋅-generator diethylamine nonoate, the electron spin resonance spectrum of the PHS-2-derived tyrosyl radical is replaced by the spectrum of another free radical containing a nitrogen atom. The magnitude of the nitrogen hyperfine coupling constant in the latter species unambiguously identifies it as an iminoxyl radical, which is likely formed by the oxidation of nitrosotyrosine, a stable product of the addition of NO⋅ to tyrosyl radical. Addition of superoxide dismutase did not alter the spectra, indicating that peroxynitrite was not involved. Western blot analysis of PHS-2 after exposure to the NO⋅-generator revealed nitrotyrosine formation. The results provide a mechanism for nitric oxide-dependent tyrosine nitration that does not require formation of more highly reactive nitrogen oxide intermediates such as peroxynitrite or nitrogen dioxide.

Nitrotyrosine has been detected in samples from a wide variety of disease states, including acute lung injury (1Haddad I.Y. Pataki G. Hu P. Galliani C. Beckman J.S. Matalon S. J. Clin.

In most of the above cases, the nitrotyrosine detection was presumed to be the result of the reaction of tyrosine residues with peroxynitrite/peroxynitrous acid. Peroxynitrite is formed in the reaction between nitric oxide (NO⋅) and superoxide. Recently, however, other mechanisms for the production of nitrotyrosine that are independent of peroxynitrite have been identified (16Oury T.D. Tatro L. Ghio A.J. Piantadosi C.A. Free Radical Res. 1995; 23: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 17Eiserich J.P. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1995; 319: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar).Nitric oxide has been shown to react with the stable tyrosyl radical residue that is involved in the catalytic mechanism of ribonucleotide reductase, quenching the tyrosyl radical signal in the electron spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of the enzyme (19Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Bobé P. Lemaire G. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21891-21897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nitric oxide, a free radical, is expected to form a radical-radical adduct with organic radicals such as the phenoxyl radical of a tyrosine residue. The inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and the quenching of its tyrosyl radical ESR spectrum are reversible with time (19Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Bobé P. Lemaire G. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21891-21897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lepoivre M. Chenais B. Yapo A. Lemaire G. Thelander L. Tenu J.-P. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5411-5418Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), suggesting that NO⋅ forms a complex with the radical that can decay back to the radical pair. Oxidation of such a complex, however, would likely lead to the formation of modified tyrosine residues, including nitrotyrosine. Prostaglandin H synthase, like ribonucleotide reductase, has a tyrosine residue oxidized to the corresponding phenoxyl radical during its catalysis. To test the hypothesis that nitrotyrosine can be formed from the NO⋅-adduct of a tyrosyl radical, the tyrosyl radical formed during the catalytic production of prostaglandins by prostaglandin H synthase-2 was exposed to the nitric oxide-generating compound diethylamine nonoate.RESULTSThe ESR spectrum of PHS-2 acquired 4 s after addition of arachidonic acid exhibited a single line with a peak-to-trough line width of 27.4 G and with indications of resolved hyperfine structure (Fig. 1, spectrum A), which has been assigned to a tyrosyl radical residue (26Hsi L.C. Hoganson C.W. Babcock G.T. Smith W.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 202: 1592-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ESR spectra obtained after additional incubation at room temperature maintained the linewidth observed at the first time point, but the lineshape increased in doublet character (Fig. 1, spectra B–D). The signal intensity also decreased at the later time points. No ESR spectrum was detected in the absence of added arachidonic acid (data not shown).Inclusion of the NO⋅-generator DEA/NO in the reaction mixture resulted in the replacement of the tyrosyl radical spectrum with that of another species, which exhibited hyperfine coupling to an atom with a nuclear spin of 1, e.g. a nitrogen atom (Fig. 1,spectrum E). The concentration of this species persisted for another 10 s at room temperature but decreased to undetectable levels after further incubation at room temperature (Fig. 1,spectra G and H). The spectrum detected at 77 K in the presence of NO⋅ is typical of an immobilized nitroxide, but the nitrogen hyperfine coupling constants were much larger than those of simple nitroxides, approximately A ∥ = 39 G and A ⊥ = 20 G (see Fig.2). The magnitude of the isotropic nitrogen hyperfine coupling constant (a iso = (A ∥ + 2A ⊥)/3 = 26.3 G) identifies the free radical detected in the presence of NO⋅ as an iminoxyl radical (27Green R.G. Sutcliffe L.H. Preston P.N. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1975; 2: 1380-1384Crossref Google Scholar). The spectrum was simulated starting with the nitrogen hyperfine coupling constants measured from the spectrum by inspection. Slight variations of the hyperfine coupling constants by the computer program to minimize the difference between the experimental and the calculated spectra gave a best-fit simulation with the following parameters: A x = 19.9 G,A y = 23.7 G, and A z = 40.1 G (A iso = 27.9 G); g x = 2.0078,g y = 2.0053, g z = 2.0042 (the simulation is presented in Fig. 2). In some experiments the ESR spectra obtained from samples that had been exposed to DEA/NO exhibited characteristics of both the tyrosyl radical and the iminoxyl radical discussed above, with the iminoxyl radical becoming the dominant species after longer room temperature incubations. The use of lower concentrations of DEA/NO resulted in correspondingly increased tyrosyl radical character of the ESR spectra (data not shown). Depletion of the DEA/NO stock solution by overnight incubation at room temperature (16 h) before use prevented iminoxyl radical formation (data not shown).Figure 2Experimental and computer-simulated spectra of the tyrosyl iminoxyl radical resulting from the reaction of PHS-2 tyrosyl radical and nitric oxide. Upper spectrum, arachidonic acid (250 μm) was added to PHS-2 (25 μm) and DEA/NO (500 μm), and the sample was frozen within 4 s of the addition of arachidonic acid.

To eliminate the possibility that the iminoxyl radical formation arose from a reaction involving peroxynitrite, superoxide dismutase was added to the reaction mixture to prevent peroxynitrite formation. Inclusion of 1000 units/ml superoxide dismutase in the reaction mixture did not modify either the ESR spectrum or the kinetics of its changes as a function of time in the NO⋅ experiments (data not shown).Reconstitution of PHS-2 with manganese-heme rather than iron-heme results in a protein that retains cyclooxygenase activity but has greatly decreased peroxidase activity (29Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Some published evidence has suggested the formation of an enzymatic tyrosyl radical during the catalysis of Mn-PHS-1 (29Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), but that suggestion has not been supported with unequivocal ESR data (30Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A.

To test whether tyrosyl radicals are formed in the Mn-enzyme and to determine whether iminoxyl radical formation is a more general phenomenon upon exposure of tyrosyl radicals to NO⋅, the experiments were repeated with Mn-PHS-2. Addition of arachidonic acid to PHS-2 that had been reconstituted with manganese-heme resulted in the generation of an ESR spectrum with a peak-to-trough linewidth of 30 G (Fig. 3) and a g value of 2.005, which is slightly lower than that of the tyrosyl radical of Fe-PHS (2.006). No hyperfine structure was resolved in the ESR spectrum of Mn-PHS-2 (Fig. 3, spectra A–E). Previous experiments have indicated that the signal arises from multiple radicals (30Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 3ESR spectra of Mn-PHS-2 after addition of arachidonic acid with and without added DEA/NO. The results are typical of two experiments. Spectrum A, Mn-PHS-2 (25 μm) frozen 4 s after the addition of arachidonic acid (AA) (250 μm). Spectrum B, the same as in spectrum A after warming to room temperature for 20 s and refreezing the sample. Spectrum C, the sample was thawed for another 10 s and refrozen. Spectrum D, the sample was thawed for an additional 20 s and refrozen.Spectrum E, the sample was warmed to room temperature for an additional 126 s and refrozen. Spectrum F, the same as in spectrum A, except that DEA/NO (500 μm) was added to the reaction mixture 3 min before the addition of arachidonic acid. Spectrum G, the sample in spectrum F was warmed to room temperature for 10 s and refrozen. Spectrum H, the sample from spectrum G was warmed to room temperature for an additional 10 s and then refrozen.Spectrum I, the sample from spectrum H was warmed to room temperature for an additional 10 s and refrozen.Spectrum J, the sample from spectrum I was warmed to room temperature for an additional 20 s and refrozen.Spectrum K, the sample from spectrum J was warmed to room temperature for an additional 126 s and was refrozen. Instrument settings were as follows: for scans A–E, modulation amplitude, 1 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; time constant, 2.6 s; scan time, 1342 s (180 G scan); receiver gain, 1 × 105; microwave power, 2 mW; for scans F–K, modulation amplitude 2 G; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; time constant 5.2 s, scan time, 1342 s (180 G scan); receiver gain, 1 × 105; microwave power, 2 mW.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Upon reaction of Mn-PHS with arachidonic acid in the presence of DEA/NO, the ESR spectrum of the protein is much less intense than the spectrum obtained from Mn-PHS-2 in the absence of DEA/NO (12 ± 6% of the integrated area of the Mn-PHS-2 spectrum). Increasing intensity in the low field region of the spectrum is observed upon longer incubation at room temperature, with the spectrum detected after 3 min strongly resembling the iminoxyl radical spectrum observed with Fe-PHS (Fig. 3, spectra F–K). Apparently, the tyrosyl and the tyrosine iminoxyl radicals coexist at intermediate time points. As was the case with Fe-PHS-2 in the presence of DEA/NO, hyperfine coupling to a nitrogen atom with A ∥ ∼ 38 G and A⊥ ∼ 22 G (compare with 39 and 20 G, respectively, for Fe-PHS) was observed, consistent with iminoxyl radical formation. The greater linewidth of the ESR signal detected from Mn-PHS-1 (29Kulmacz R.J. Palmer G. Wei C. Tsai A.-L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5428-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Lassmann G. Odenwaller R. Curtis J.F. DeGray J.A. Mason R.P. Marnett L.J. Eling T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20045-20055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been suggested to arise from magnetic coupling between the paramagnetic manganese heme system and the radical (31Streider S. Schaible K. Scherer H.-J. Dietz R. Ruf H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13870-13878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This proposal is consistent with the greater linewidth observed in the iminoxyl radical detected from Mn-PHS-2.The conversion of the tyrosyl radical to an iminoxyl radical to ESR-silent products in Fe-PHS-2 suggests a continuing series of oxidations. The 1-electron oxidation of an iminoxyl radical would lead to nitrotyrosine residues in PHS-2. To test this hypothesis, both Fe-PHS-2 and Mn-PHS-2 samples, subsequent to the ESR studies, were subjected to Western analysis using an antibody specific for nitrotyrosine. A triplet staining pattern was observed for both the Fe-PHS-2 and Mn-PHS-2 samples that were exposed to NO⋅ at the appropriate molecular weight for human PHS-2 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the triplet band was also detected in the Fe-PHS-2 with NO⋅ sample in the presence of superoxide dismutase (Fig. 4). Increasing the concentration of superoxide dismutase from 6 μm to 1 mm did not prevent nitrotyrosine formation (data not shown). However, no nitrotyrosine was detected in the samples that had not been exposed to NO⋅ (Fig. 4). This is consistent with the nitration of one or more tyrosine residues on the protein. The triplet band observed is due to the differential glycosylation states of the protein (32Lecomte M. Laneuville O. Ji C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13207-13215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The blots were then stripped and reprobed with an anti-human PHS-2 antibody (data not shown). PHS protein was observed in all lanes at the same molecular weight as the nitrotyrosine proteins detected for both the Fe- and Mn-PHS samples, indicating that the nitrated proteins observed are indeed PHS-2. The detection of nitrotyrosine in the Mn-PHS samples in the Western blot indicates that at least part of the ESR signal observed in the absence of NO⋅ arises from a tyrosyl radical (Fig. 3,A–E).Figure 4Western blot analysis for nitrotyrosine formation in the reactions of Fe-PHS-2 and Mn-PHS-2 with arachidonic acid with and without DEA/NO added.

J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1446-1447Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 34Brokenshire J.L. Roberts J.R. Ingold K.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 7040-7049Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The relatively large hyperfine coupling constant has been suggested to result from a relatively localized electron density on the nitrogen atom (33Thomas J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1446-1447Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The detected A iso is markedly similar to the value of 26.12 G detected from the product of the oxidation of 2-nitroso-4-methylphenol, a reasonable analog of tyrosine (27Green R.G. Sutcliffe L.H. Preston P.N. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1975; 2: 1380-1384Crossref Google Scholar).The combination of the ESR experiments in which an iminoxyl radical is detected and the Western analysis for nitrotyrosine residues in PHS-2 strongly suggests the mechanism outlined in Scheme FS1. The reaction occurring between the PHS tyrosyl radical and NO⋅results in the formation of an ESR-silent diamagnetic adduct, and has been shown to occur with free tyrosyl radical at a rate that is nearly diffusion controlled (35Eiserich J.P. Butler J. van der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Formation of the ESR-silent complex between NO⋅ and tyrosyl radical shown in Scheme FS1 has also been demonstrated in photosystem II (36Petrouleas V. Diner B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 131-140Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and ribonucleotide reductase (19Lepoivre M. Flaman J.-M. Bobé P. Lemaire G. Henry Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21891-21897Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial complex formed between tyrosyl radical and NO⋅ can be decomposed back to tyrosyl radical and NO⋅ in photosystem II by evacuation of the sample, which effectively removes NO⋅ (35Eiserich J.P. Butler J. van der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Rearrangement of the initial, reversible adduct between the tyrosyl radical and NO⋅ to form 3-nitrosotyrosine, as shown in the scheme, results in the rearomatization of the system, and as such is highly energetically favored even if it is somewhat slow kinetically due to the required breakage of a C-H bond (37Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The proposal that 3-nitrosotyrosine can decompose to form nitric oxide and tyrosyl radical (35Eiserich J.P. Butler J. van der Vliet A. Cross C.E. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) is mistaken in that the cleavage of the C-N bond would form a ς radical rather than the π-phenoxyl tyrosyl radical.Figure FS1Proposed mechanism for tyrosine iminoxyl radical and nitrotyrosine formation from the reaction between tyrosyl radical and nitric oxide.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The 1-electron oxidation of the minor oxime tautomer of nitrosotyrosine shown in Scheme FS1 (38Castro, A., Iglesias, E., Leis, J.

Perkin Trans. 1994; 2: 957-960Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) results in the formation of the iminoxyl radical that is detected. Iminoxyl radicals have been chemically synthesized by oxidation of the corresponding oximes (33Thomas J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1964; 86: 1446-1447Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 34Brokenshire J.L. Roberts J.R. Ingold K.U. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1972; 94: 7040-7049Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Free nitrosophenols and nitrosonaphthols have been shown to be oxidized to the corresponding iminoxyl radicals both chemically (27Green R.G. Sutcliffe L.H. Preston P.N. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1975; 2: 1380-1384Crossref Google Scholar) and with horseradish peroxidase (40Fischer V. Mason R.P. Chem.-Biol. Interact. 1986; 57: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Iminoxyl radical formation has also been detected in the photosystem II system, although the time scale for iminoxyl radical formation is hours instead of seconds in that system (37Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).Further oxidation of the tyrosine iminoxyl radical results in the formation of nitrotyrosine, an ESR-silent product that was detected in Western blots. The source of the oxidizing equivalents for the oxidations of nitrosotyrosine and its corresponding iminoxyl radical has not been identified. The strongly oxidizing peroxidase activity of PHS-2 represents one reasonable source. This conclusion is supported by the data from the Mn-substituted enzyme, in which the conversion of the tyrosyl radical to the iminoxyl radical is greatly slowed (compare Fig.1 with Fig. 3) since the Mn-enzyme has only 4% of the peroxidase activity of the Fe-enzyme (28Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6665) Google Scholar), but other oxidants such as nitrogen dioxide may also be important and have not been excluded.The recently reported detection of a tyrosine iminoxyl radical resulting from the reaction between the tyrosyl radical of photosystem II and NO⋅ (37Sanakis Y. Goussias C. Mason R.P. Petrouleas V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and our evidence for tyrosine nitration via an iminoxyl radical in PHS-2 provide at least two examples of this chemistry in biological systems. The absence of inhibition of tyrosine nitration by the addition of a large concentration of superoxide dismutase indicates that the superoxide-dependent peroxynitrite/peroxynitrous acid is not involved in tyrosine nitration by NO⋅ in PHS-2.There are numerous reports of tyrosyl radical formation in different systems throughout biology. In addition to the unstable tyrosyl radical of prostaglandin H synthase (41Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), stable tyrosyl radicals in ribonucleotide reductase and photosystem II (42Reichard P. Ehrenberg A.

A. 1987; 84: 7099-7103Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) have been detected. Furthermore, tyrosyl radicals have been detected in oxidatively damaged hemoproteins such as myoglobin (44Miki H. Harada K. Yamazaki I. Tamura M. Watanabe H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 275: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), hemoglobin (45McArthur K.M. Davies M.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1996; 271: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Since NO⋅ is made by a variety of cell types, the opportunity for tyrosine iminoxyl free radical formation exists in any protein where tyrosyl radical formation occurs, making this a potentially general mechanism for tyrosine nitration. The detection of nitrotyrosine in proteins or tissues that have been exposed to conditions of oxidative stress is rapidly becoming an assay of choice in the implication of oxidative tissue damage as a mechanism of disease. Nitrotyrosine has been detected in samples from a wide variety of disease states, including acute lung injury (1Haddad I.Y. Pataki G. Hu P. Galliani C. Beckman J.S. Matalon S. J. Clin.

The SH2 domain has been shown to interact specifically with sequences containing a phosphotyrosine residue, whereas the SH3 domain mediates binding to proline-rich sequences with the minimal consensus of PXXP (P represents proline, and X designates any amino acid) (1Pawson T.

The SH2 and SH3 domains thus consist of a common binding core that recognizes phosphotyrosine- or proline-rich motifs, respectively, and which achieve binding specificity through unique flanking sequences (3Songyang Z.

As a result, these domains determine which proteins can interact, and equally important, in what order the interaction occurs in the closely regulated pathways of signal transduction. Recently, two other important signaling modules were characterized: the pleckstrin homology domain and the protein interaction domain/phosphotyrosine binding domain (6Haslam R.J. Kolde H.B.

Using the technique of Western ligand blotting in performing in vitro binding assays, we further narrowed the binding region of WBP-1 to a proline-rich motif with the sequence Pro-Pro-Pro-Pro-Tyr (PPPPY), which we chose to call the PY motif, interestingly, the only region of perfect homology between WBP-1 and WBP-2. Binding assays using mutant forms of the PY motif established the preliminary minimal binding consensus as XPPXY (where X signifies any amino acid) required for interaction with the WW domain of YAP. Based on these results and the observation that the PY motif failed to bind arbitrarily to selected SH3 domains, we proposed that the PY motif differed from the binding consensus determined for SH3 ligands. Although the WW and SH3 domains are functionally similar, their three-dimensional structures are different (for review, see Ref. 11Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The WW domain has its NH2 and COOH termini in close juxtaposition, opposite from the ligand binding surface, allowing the modular unit to exist close to the protein surface exposed to the solvent (20Macias M.J. Hyvonen M. Schultz J. Saraste M. Sudol M. Oschkinat H. Nature. 1996; 382: 646-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The NMR solution structure solved for the WW domain of YAP consists of a bent three-stranded antiparallel β sheet and a hydrophobic ligand binding pocket composed of leucine 190, tyrosine 188, and tryptophan 199 (the second conserved tryptophan). The two central proline residues of the consensus ligand (XPPXY) contact tryptophan 199 through van der Waals interactions, whereas the tyrosine residue of the PY ligand fits into a hydrophobic pocket of the WW domain formed by leucine 190 and histidine 192. In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of the complete cDNA clones for the murine and human orthologs of WBP-1 and WBP-2. Furthermore, the human genes encoding these two proteins were localized to chromosomes 2p12 and 17q25, respectively. To elucidate further the binding requirements of the PY motif, we replaced various positions of the motif with all possible amino acid residues and then assayed for in vitro binding to the WW domain of YAP using the “SPOTs” technique of multiple peptide synthesis on derivatized cellulose (28Frank R. Doring R. Tetrahedron. 1988; 44: 6031-6040Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Blankenmeyer-Menge B. Nimitz B. Frank R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 1701-1704Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Finally, through site-directed mutagenesis of the conserved residues of the WW domain, we showed that the conservative substitution of the residues tyrosine 188, tryptophan 199, histidine 192, and proline 202 with related amino acids abolished binding, suggesting that these residues are important for binding. Mouse WBP-1 and WBP-2 partial cDNAs (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) were used as probes to screen a λ pCEV9 cDNA library derived from M426 human lung fibroblast cells (21Miki T. Matsui T. Heidanran M.A. Aaronson S.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 83: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Stuart Aaronson). The low stringency conditions of hybridization were as follows: 4 × SSPE, 10 × Denhardt's, 2% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 106 cpm/ml32P-labeled cDNA at 65 °C overnight. The filters were washed twice at 60 °C for 20 min with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. The λ pCEV9 cDNA library contained phages with a plasmid portion that carried the insert. The plasmids with inserts were easily rescued from the λ genome following the published protocol (21Miki T. Matsui T. Heidanran M.A. Aaronson S.A. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 83: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The apparently complete sequence of human WBP-1 cDNA was contained in one recombinant plasmid pCEV9-hWBP1 (clone 43) with aBamHI-HindIII insert of 1.2 kilobases. Human WBP-2 cDNA was contained in one recombinant plasmid pCEV9-hWBP2 (clone 29) with a BamHI-HindIII insert of 1.8 kilobases. Both strands of the cDNA clones were subsequently sequenced directly using the Sanger method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52764) Google Scholar). To isolate the remainder of the cDNA for murine WBP-1, a 16-day mouse embryo cDNA library was screened with the partial cDNA clone coding for murine WBP-1 that was isolated previously according to published protocols (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 23Ausubel, F. M., Brent, R., Kingston, R. E., Moore, D. D., Sidman, J. G., Smith, J. A., and Struhl, K. (eds) (1987) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Plaques representing the library were lifted onto nitrocellulose filters, which were subsequently incubated in hybridization solution (6 × SSC, 0.01 m EDTA, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA) with random labeled cDNA probe overnight at 68 °C. The filters were then washed in 2 × SSC, 0.5% SDS, and 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and then 0.1 × SSC, 0.5% SDS at 65 °C before exposing to film. The longest clone obtained by this method was selected for direct DNA sequencing by the Sanger method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52764) Google Scholar). The remainder of the murine WBP-2 cDNA clone was successfully isolated using the technique of 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (Life Technologies, Inc.). First, the cDNA coding for WBP-2 was derived from poly(A)+-purified mouse liver RNA with reverse transcriptase using the following primer to the coding region: 5′ dTCCCTTAATGAAGTTCGC. A poly(C) tail was added to the 5′ end of the cDNA following the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The 5′ regions of WBP-2 cDNA were amplified using polymerase chain reaction with primers annealing to the 5′ poly(C) tail (5′-dCUACUACUACUAGGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG, I denoting deoxyinosine) and to a region in the coding region of WBP-2 (5′- dAUGAUCAUAGGACAUUAG). The cDNA fragments were then isolated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Lymphocytes isolated from human blood were cultured in a minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and phytohemagglutinin at 37 °C for 68–72 h. The lymphocytes cultures were treated with bromodeoxyuridin (0.18 mg/ml, Sigma) to synchronize the cell population. The synchronized cells were washed three times with serum-free medium to release the block and recultured at 37 °C for 6 h in minimal essential medium with thymidine (2.5 μg/ml, Sigma). Cells were harvested, and slides were made using standard procedures including hypotonic treatment, fixation, and air drying. The cDNA inserts for WBP-1 and WBP-2 were separately biotinylated with dATP using the Life Technologies, Inc. BioNick labeling kit at 15 °C for 1 h as described elsewhere (24Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The procedure for FISH detection was performed as described previously (24Heng H.H.Q. Squire J. Tsui L.-C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9509-9513Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar,25Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L-C. Chromosoma ( Berl. ). 1993; 102: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Slides were baked at 55 °C for 1 h. After RNase treatment, the slides were denatured in 70% formamide in 2 × SSC for 2 min at 70 °C followed by dehydration with ethanol. The biotinylated probes were denatured at 75 °C for 5 min in a hybridization solution consisting of 50% formamide and 10% dextran sulfate. The probes were loaded on the denatured chromosomal slides. After an overnight hybridization, the slides were washed and detected as well as amplified. FISH signals and the DAPI banding pattern were recorded separately by photography, and assignment of the FISH mapping data with chromosomal bands was accomplished by superimposing FISH signals with DAPI-banded chromosomes (26Heng H.H.Q. Tsui L-C. Choo K.H.A. Molecular Biology: In Situ Hybridization Protocols. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1994: 35-49Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the WW domain of human YAP was subcloned previously in-frame into the vector pGEX-2TK, allowing it to be expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). This vector in addition allowed the purified fusion protein to be directly labeled by 32Pi at a protein kinase A phosphorylation site in the region between the GST and WW portions, as described elsewhere (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 18Chen H.I. Sudol M. Tech.

Substitution of selected amino acids in the WW domain was achieved using a double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Pharmacia). The selection primer changed the uniqueScaI site in the vector to an MluI site, the introduced mutation in boldface (5′-CTGTGACTGGTGACGCGTCAACCAAGTC-3′). The target primer was used simultaneously to effect the desired substitutions within the WW domain, the introduced mutation in boldface (W177F: 5′-GTCTTTGCCATCTCGAAACCTGCTG-3′ Y188F: 5′-GTGATTTAAGAAAAATCTCTGACCA-3′ F189Y: 5′-GATGTGATTTAAATAGTATCTCTGA-3′ H192F: 5′-TGTCTGATCGATGAAATTTAAGAAG-3′ W199F: CCTGGGGTCCTGGAATGTTGTTGTC-3′ P202A: 5′-ATGGCCTTCCTGAGCTCCTGCCATG-3′). The mutagenesis reactions were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA isolated from individual colonies was purified and sequenced by the Sanger method to confirm each mutation (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52764) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in 10-cm plates and lysed in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Trasylol, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μmantipain, 1 mm sodium vanadate). GST or GST-WW-YAP (100 μg) bound to glutathione-agarose was incubated with 200 mg of the cell lysate which was diluted 10-fold in Tris/Tween buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 1% ovalbumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol) at 4 °C overnight. The complexes were then analyzed by Western ligand blotting using 32P-GST-WW-YAP protein as a probe as described elsewhere (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Binding assays with the mutant WW-YAP protein was performed by western ligand blotting using32P-GST-GTPPPPYTVG protein as a probe (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). The peptide synthesis was accomplished following the method described by Frank and co-workers (28Frank R. Doring R. Tetrahedron. 1988; 44: 6031-6040Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29Blankenmeyer-Menge B. Nimitz B. Frank R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990; 31: 1701-1704Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) l-amino acids, derivatized cellulose membranes, instruction manual and computer software SPOTs, Release 1.0, for generating various schedules of amino acid applications were all purchased from Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. Phosphorylated serine, threonine, and tyrosine were obtained from Chem Impex International. The membranes were incubated with the32P-labeled GST-WW domain protein of human YAP under the conditions described previously (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), except the 5% milk in the blocking solution was replaced with 1 × blocking buffer supplied (as 10 × solution) by the manufacturer. After probing the membranes with 32P-labeled WW proteins, the membranes were regenerated with urea, mercaptoethanol, and acetic acid-containing buffers (as described by the manufacturer), and stained with Coomassie Blue for 10 min and destained using standard protocol for visualizing proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Uniform light blue staining was observed for the peptides with the exception of those containing Lys, Arg, or His, which were always stained more intensely with Coomassie Blue. We described previously the isolation of partial clones for murine WBP-1 and WBP-2 which were each missing part of the 5′-coding regions (17Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). In this paper, the remainder of the murine cDNA encoding these proteins was determined. Additionally, the human orthologs of WBP-1 and WBP-2 were isolated by screening a human cDNA library (M426 lung fibroblasts) under low stringency conditions with the corresponding murine cDNA probes. Human and murine WBP-1 share an 84% sequence identity (Fig.1 A), whereas human and murine WBP-2 are 94% identical (Fig. 1 B), not considering those residues that are biochemically similar. The WBP-1 and WBP-2 sequences are dissimilar except for the conserved PY motif. Data-base searches using the FASTA program again did not reveal any known proteins with significant homology to WBP-1. However, human WBP-2 shared 26 and 29% homology with two proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans (unnamed, with GenBank accession numbers U40413 and Z47808) respectively, as predicted from the open reading frames. These two C. elegans proteins have yet to be characterized. Interestingly, the most extensive region of homology between WBP-2 and the C. elegans proteins contains the PY motif (marked by an asterisk). The PY motif in the C. elegans proteins lacks a proline in the first position but still conforms to the XPPXY consensus that has been established as the minimal sequence that can bind to the WW domain of YAP. Additionally, another region (marked by two asterisks) contains a sequence that has theXPPXY consensus. The above sequence comparison implies that these regions have been relatively well conserved through evolution because of their functional significance, presumably in mediating protein-protein interactions. A third region containing PPPPY sequence (indicated with arrows, Fig. 1 B) is conserved between human and mouse WBP-2 sequences, but it is not present in the C. elegans protein. Under the conditions described, the hybridization efficiency for the WBP-1 cDNA probe was approximately 81% (among 100 mitotic figures examined, 81 showed signals on one pair of chromosomes). Similarly, the efficiency for the WBP-2 cDNA probe was approximately 76%. The detailed positions of the loci were determined further based on the summary from 10 FISH signal photographs/probe; representative hybridization pictures are shown in Fig. 2, Aand D. By superimposing the signals obtained from FISH onto a representation of DAPI-banded chromosomes, we localized the WBP-1 locus to chromosome 2p12 and the WBP-2 locus to chromosome 17q25 (Fig.2, C and F, respectively). Some hybridization of the WBP-1 cDNA occurred at chromosome 2p11.2 as well, but this signal was considerably weaker compared with hybridization at region p12. To determine the residues of the WW domain which are important for binding, we performedin vitro site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues in the WW domain fused to GST (Fig. 3). The most conserved residues in the domain were chosen, including Trp177, Tyr188, Phe189, His92, Trp199, and Pro202. Since we were interested in elucidating the residues directly involved in forming the binding surface and contacting the ligand, we replaced the above residues with amino acids similar in structure and size. Replacing with amino acids too dissimilar in size would have risked disturbing the natural tertiary structure of the WW fold. We conducted filter binding assays in which these GST-WW mutant proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane that was subsequently probed with32P-labeled GST-PY protein. The WW mutants Y188F, H192F, P202A, and W199F failed to bind to the ligand probe (Fig.4 A). However, the constructs W177F and F189Y were still able to bind to the ligand, and the former construct may bind at a slightly higher affinity than even the wild type GST-WW protein (Fig. 4 A). Thus, according to these results, the residues Tyr188, His192, Trp199, and Pro202 seem to be involved in establishing the binding surface of the WW domain. Alternatively, some of these residues may be critical for maintaining the three-dimensional structure of the binding site on the nitrocellulose membrane, should a renatured form of the GST-WW protein be required to retain binding function.Figure 4Binding activity of different WW mutants. Panel A, purified GST-WW proteins with various amino acid substitutions in the WW domain were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane.

The blots were probed with32P-labeled GST-WW (wild type) protein.

As a result, coprecipitation assays were conducted in which GST-WW proteins coupled to glutathione-agarose were incubated with cell lysates to isolate the endogenous ligand to the WW domain of YAP. Using this method, the residues His192, Pro202, and Trp199were found to be important for the WW domain to bind its ligand in solution (Fig. 4 B). Remarkably, residue Tyr188, previously found to be important in filter binding assays, does not seem to be implicated in the binding activity of the WW domain in its natural form since the construct Y188F still was able to coprecipitate the endogenous ligand (Fig. 4 B). Each position of the target ligand, Gly1-Thr2-Pro3-Pro4-Pro5-Pro6-Tyr7-Thr8-Val9-Gly10, corresponding to residues 170–179 of the mouse WBP-1 sequence, was substituted with all possible amino acids using SPOTs peptide synthesis to determine the binding requirements of the YAP WW domain ligand. Certain points can be inferred from the results of the SPOTs analysis: The replacement of the Pro4 residue with leucine, serine, valine, or alanine resulted in weak binders to the WW domain of YAP. However, substitution with other amino acids in this position abolished binding completely, in agreement with the consensus established earlier (Fig. 5). When the Pro5 position was replaced with a tyrosine (Fig. 6, spot 20), the peptide bound with moderate affinity. All other substitutions at Pro5 were negative. Tyr7 could not be replaced with phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine, or with any other amino acid without disrupting binding activity. Also, a target peptide containing a phosphorylated tyrosine failed to interact with the WW domain, suggesting a method of regulating binding activity by tyrosine phosphorylation. The Tyr7 residue seems to be the least tolerant of any substitution. Moreover, the target peptide with the reverse sequence (GVTYPPPPTG) does not bind to the WW domain of"

Sialic acids are a common nonreducing terminus of vertebrate glycoconjugates and appear to play uniquely important roles in recognition phenomena. Because sialic acids may be linked to Gal, GalNAc, or other sialic acid residues at various positions and because they may carry different substituents on their 9-carbon base structure, the sialic acids represent a diverse family of carbohydrate determinants (11Varki A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In certain sialic acid-dependent recognition systems, determinant stringency is low. For example, selectins bind to oligosaccharides bearing truncated sialic acids (12Tyrrell D. James P. Rao N. Foxall C. Abbas S. Dasgupta F. Nashed N. Hasegawa A. Kiso M. Asa D. Kidd J. Brandley B.K.

Aliquots (50 μl) of ethanol/water (1:1) containing phosphatidylcholine (0.5 μm), cholesterol (2.0 μm), and gangliosides (concentrations as indicated) were added to microwells (96-well Serocluster, Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). Plates were incubated for 90 min uncovered at ambient temperature to allow partial evaporation and lipid adsorption (28Blackburn C.C. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol.

Wells were preblocked by addition of 100 μl/well Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Plates were covered and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to cell addition (see below). Transfected COS cells were harvested using hypertonic Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA as described (22Yang L.J.-S. Zeller C.B. Shaper N.L. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Shapiro R.E. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfected cells were pretreated with neuraminidase, which enhances cell adhesion without changing carbohydrate binding specificity (20Collins B.E. Yang L.J.-S. Mukhopadhyay G. Filbin M.T. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1248-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), as follows. Aliquots of cells (500 μl) were placed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and 10 milliunits of Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (Calbiochem) were added. Suspensions were incubated for 1.5–2 h at 37 °C with end-over-end mixing. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and resuspended at 250,000 cells/ml in Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion on representative transfected cells. Prior to pretreatment, cells were 84% viable. After neuraminidase or control pretreatment, viability ranged from 81 to 85%, essentially unchanged from the freshly collected cells. Quantitation of cell adhesion was via an enzyme assay (see below) that measured only viable cells. Aliquots of the cell suspension (200 μl) were added to preblocked, lipid-adsorbed microwells and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min to allow the cells to settle and then at 37 °C for 45 min. To gently remove nonadherent cells after the incubations, plates were immersed in phosphate-buffered saline, inverted, and placed in an immersed Plexiglas box that was sealed with a gasket to exclude air (27Yang L.J.-S. Zeller C.B. Schnaar R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The inverted plate in its fluid-filled chamber was placed in a centrifuge carrier and centrifuged at 110 × g. The box was again immersed in phosphate-buffered saline; the plate was removed and righted (while immersed); and excess surface buffer was removed by aspiration, leaving 300 μl/well. Adherent cells were lysed by addition of 20 μl of 10% Triton X-100 to each well, and 80 μl were removed to a fresh 96-well plate for quantitation. Cell adhesion was quantitated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase activity in the cell lysate after addition of 120 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.7 mm NADH and 4.7 mm pyruvate. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm as a function of time was measured simultaneously in each well using a Molecular Devices UV multiwell kinetic plate reader. This method is amenable to testing large numbers of samples. The data presented are compiled from ≈4000 individual data points and are presented as the mean ± S.E. of the mean for 3–103 replicate determinations. Where indicated, the statistical significance of adhesion to ganglioside-adsorbed surfaces compared with control surfaces (adsorbed with phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol, but no ganglioside) was determined using a two-tailed Student'st test. MAG-, SMP-, and sialoadhesin-transfected COS cells bound specifically to ganglioside-adsorbed surfaces (Figs. 1, 2, 3). Adhesion to the most potent target gangliosides was typically very high (>80% of the cells added), whereas background adhesion to surfaces adsorbed with phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol without ganglioside was low. COS cells transfected with CD22 failed to adhere to any ganglioside tested (GD1a, GD1b, GD3, GT1b, GQ1b, and GQ1bα). COS cells transfected with either of the two splice variants of MAG (L-MAG and S-MAG) demonstrated the same extent and specificity of adhesion to a representative set of ganglioside-adsorbed surfaces (GM1, GD1a, GD1b, GT1b, and GQ1bα) (data not shown). Therefore, L-MAG-transfected COS cells were used in subsequent experiments, and all data presented on MAG-mediated adhesion refer to the long splice variant. The two neural sialoadhesins, MAG and SMP, had similar ganglioside binding specificities (Figs. 1, 2, 3). The abundant brain gangliosides GD1a (at ≥12.5 pmol/well) and GT1b (at ≥25 pmol/well) supported highly significant adhesion (p < 0.0002) of both MAG- and SMP-transfected COS cells (Fig. 1,A and B). Other gangliosides including GM3 and GM4 also supported significant adhesion of both lectins, although only at ≥10-fold higher ganglioside concentrations compared with GD1a. In contrast, neither MAG nor SMP bound to GM1, GD1b, or GD3, indicating that both lectins require a terminal α2,3-linked sialic acid. All gangliosides that supported statistically significant adhesion of SMP contained the NeuAcα2,3Gal terminal structure (see Fig. 3), whereas all nonsupportive gangliosides lacked this terminal structure. MAG supported adhesion to the same gangliosides, although typically with higher efficiency (greater number of adherent cells). This may be due to more efficient transfection with the MAG plasmid, higher expression of the transfected MAG, and/or more effective ganglioside binding by MAG. Flow cytometry using a MAG/SMP cross-reactive antibody (mAb 513) indicated that more MAG-transfected cells (48.2%) expressed the highest level of lectin compared with SMP-transfected cells (28.3%). Within these highest expressing populations, the mean fluorescence intensities were similar (496 and 441 relative units for MAG and SMP, respectively). In addition to gangliosides bearing the NeuAcα2,3Gal terminus, GQ1b (which bears only α2,8-linked sialic acid termini) supported a low amount of adhesion by MAG-transfected cells. This preparation of GQ1b, however, was contaminated with a small amount of GT1b (20Collins B.E. Yang L.J.-S. Mukhopadhyay G. Filbin M.T. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Schnaar R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1248-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We conclude that MAG and SMP bind with similar rank-order potency to gangliosides terminated with NeuAcα2,3Gal (see Fig. 3). In contrast to MAG and SMP, sialoadhesin had a distinctly broader binding specificity. Several gangliosides with terminal NeuAcα2,3Gal structures (GD1a, GT1b, GM3, and GM4) as well as GD1b (which bears only a terminal NeuAcα2,8NeuAc structure) supported nearly equivalent sialoadhesin-mediated adhesion (Fig. 1 C). GD3and GQ1b, which also bear only NeuAcα2,8NeuAc termini, supported sialoadhesin binding with moderate potency. Binding was structurally specific in that GM1 did not support sialoadhesin-mediated adhesion. Prior studies indicated that MAG bound with markedly high affinity to one of the “Chol-1” gangliosides (22Yang L.J.-S. Zeller C.B. Shaper N.L. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Shapiro R.E. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). These minor brain gangliosides bear a sialic acid linked α2,6 to the GalNAc(III) of the gangliotetraose core (structures in Fig.3) (30Hirabayashi Y. Nakao T. Irie F. Whittaker V.P. Kon K. Ando S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12973-12978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 2 presents a comparison of adhesion of MAG-, SMP-, and sialoadhesin-transfected COS cells to synthetic Chol-1 and related gangliosides. MAG and SMP again had markedly similar binding specificities (Fig. 2, A and B). GT1β was equipotent to GT1b in supporting MAG and SMP binding, whereas GQ1bα was 10-fold more potent. GM1α, which contains a single α2,6-linked sialic acid, failed to support adhesion of either lectin. Therefore, the terminal NeuAcα2,3Gal structure is required for both SMP- and MAG-mediated cell adhesion, and additional sialic acids on the internal GalNAc(III) and Gal(II) of the gangliotetraose core enhance binding of MAG and SMP to a similar extent. In contrast, GQ1bα was only modestly (<3-fold) more potent than GT1b in supporting sialoadhesin-mediated adhesion. Binding potencies for all gangliosides tested using MAG-, SMP-, and sialoadhesin-mediated cell adhesion are summarized in Fig. 3. The MAG/SMP cross-reactive antibody mAb 513 (4Dulac C. Tropak M.B.

J. Neurosci. Res. 1990; 25: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and gangliosides (22Yang L.J.-S. Zeller C.B. Shaper N.L. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Shapiro R.E. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), demonstrated the carbohydrate-binding site structural similarity between MAG and SMP and their difference from sialoadhesin. As shown in Fig.4, mAb 513 eliminated or markedly reduced binding of MAG and SMP to GT1b, whereas binding of sialoadhesin was unaffected. The anti-sialoadhesin blocking mAb 3D6 (32Crocker P.R. Kelm S. DuBois C. Martin B. McWilliam A.S. Shotton D.M. Paulson J.C. Gordon S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1661-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) inhibited binding of sialoadhesin to GT1b (data not shown). Sialic acid is a complex monosaccharide, with a carboxylic acid, an N-acyl group, and a glycerol side chain within its structure (see Fig. 7). Chemically modified and synthetic gangliosides were used to determine which sialic acid substituent groups are required for binding by sialoadhesin family members. Since GD1a supports highly significant adhesion of MAG, SMP, and sialoadhesin (Fig. 1), it was used as a basis for testing sialic acid chemical modifications. GD1a was selectively oxidized with periodate under conditions that cleave exclusively between C-7–C-8 and C-8–C-9 on the sialic acid glycerol side chain. Mass spectrometry indicated equal conversion of GD1a sialic acids to their corresponding 7- and 8-carbon aldehydes (data not shown). A portion of the resulting GD1a aldehydes was reduced with sodium borohydride, resulting in conversion to the corresponding 7- and 8-carbon alcohols. As shown in Fig.5, neither the 7/8-aldehyde nor 7/8-alcohol sialic acid derivatives of GD1a supported binding of any of the I-type lectins tested. Similarly, modifications of the carboxylic acids on GD1a abrogated binding. Conversion of both sialic acids on GD1a to the corresponding 1-ethyl esters, 1-amides, or 1-alcohols completely eliminated binding of MAG-, SMP-, and sialoadhesin-transfected COS cells (Fig. 5). The structures of all GD1a derivatives were confirmed by thin-layer chromatography, DEAE-Sepharose chromatography (of carboxylate derivatives), and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry at the Middle Atlantic Mass Spectrometry Laboratory (21Dell A. Reason A.J. Khoo K.-H. Panico M. McDowell R.A. Morris H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 108-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Since GM3 and GM4 (bearing a terminalN-acetylneuraminic acid) supported substantial adhesion mediated by both sialoadhesin and MAG, a series of synthetic analogs based on these structures (19Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 242: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) was used to determine the role of each sialic acid hydroxyl group and the sialic acid N-acyl group on adhesion (binding of SMP to GM3 and GM4 was insufficient to allow valid comparisons). Consistent with chemical modification studies, the 8-deoxy and 9-methoxy forms of GM3 failed to support adhesion mediated by either MAG or sialoadhesin (Fig. 6). In contrast, the 4-deoxy and 7-deoxy forms of GM3 were comparable to GM3 in supporting sialoadhesin-mediated adhesion, but failed to support substantial MAG-mediated adhesion. Furthermore, the sialic acid acetamido group appears to be involved in lectin binding. GM4 supported sialoadhesin and MAG binding, whereas a derivative bearing a 5-deaminated analog of neuraminic acid (KDN-GM4) failed to support binding by either lectin (Fig.6). These data are consistent with the prior published observations that glycoconjugates bearing N-glycolylneuraminic acid fail to support MAG (20Collins B.E. Yang L.J.-S. Mukhopadhyay G. Filbin M.T.

https://openalex.org/W2157531111,"A glycine-rich loop in the ATP-binding site is one of the most highly conserved sequence motifs in protein kinases. Each conserved glycine (Gly-50, Gly-52, and Gly-55) in the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) was replaced with Ser and/or Ala. Active mutant proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli, purified to apparent homogeneity, separated into phosphoisoforms, and characterized. Replacing Gly-55 had minimal effects on steady-state kinetic parameters, whereas replacement of either Gly-50 or Gly-52 had major effects on bothK m and k cat values consistent with the prediction of the importance of the tip of the glycine-rich loop for catalysis. Substitution of Gly-50 caused a 5–8-fold reduction in K m (ATP), an 8–12-fold increase in K m (peptide), and a 3–5-fold drop in k cat. TheK m (ATP) andK m (peptide) values of C(G52S) were increased 8- and 18-fold, respectively, and thek cat was decreased 6-fold. In contrast to catalytic efficiency, the ATPase rates of C(G50S) and C(G52S) were increased by more than an order of magnitude. The thermostability of each mutant was slightly increased. Unphosphorylated C(G52S) was characterized as well as several isoforms phosphorylated at a single site, Ser-338. All of these phosphorylation-defective mutants displayed a substantial decrease in both enzymatic activity and thermal stability that correlated with the missing phosphate at Thr-197. These results are correlated with the crystal structure, models of the respective mutant proteins, and conservation of the Glys within the protein kinase family. A glycine-rich loop in the ATP-binding site is one of the most highly conserved sequence motifs in protein kinases. Each conserved glycine (Gly-50, Gly-52, and Gly-55) in the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAPK) was replaced with Ser and/or Ala. Active mutant proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli, purified to apparent homogeneity, separated into phosphoisoforms, and characterized. Replacing Gly-55 had minimal effects on steady-state kinetic parameters, whereas replacement of either Gly-50 or Gly-52 had major effects on bothK m and k cat values consistent with the prediction of the importance of the tip of the glycine-rich loop for catalysis. Substitution of Gly-50 caused a 5–8-fold reduction in K m (ATP), an 8–12-fold increase in K m (peptide), and a 3–5-fold drop in k cat. TheK m (ATP) andK m (peptide) values of C(G52S) were increased 8- and 18-fold, respectively, and thek cat was decreased 6-fold. In contrast to catalytic efficiency, the ATPase rates of C(G50S) and C(G52S) were increased by more than an order of magnitude. The thermostability of each mutant was slightly increased. Unphosphorylated C(G52S) was characterized as well as several isoforms phosphorylated at a single site, Ser-338. All of these phosphorylation-defective mutants displayed a substantial decrease in both enzymatic activity and thermal stability that correlated with the missing phosphate at Thr-197. These results are correlated with the crystal structure, models of the respective mutant proteins, and conservation of the Glys within the protein kinase family. The eukaryotic protein kinases specific for serine, threonine, and tyrosine all share a conserved catalytic core that folds into a topologically similar three-dimensional structure (2Knighton D.R.

Particularly conserved in this core are the amino acids involved in nucleotide binding and catalysis with one of the most highly conserved features being a GXGXXG motif near the amino terminus. The first and second glycines of this triad are essentially invariant, whereas the third is somewhat more variable but is always a small residue. Our goal is to understand the functional importance of this motif, a hallmark of the protein kinase family.

It is a relatively simple protein kinase, and both its regulatory and catalytic subunits can be purified readily as active proteins in Escherichia coli. The glycine-rich motif in the C-subunit, (LG50TG52SFG55RV), displays at each position the amino acid residue found in the majority of protein kinases (3Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar, 4Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). The first crystal structure of a protein kinase was a binary complex of the C-subunit and a peptide inhibitor (2Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M.

Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Based on this structure and on subsequent structures of other protein kinases, the conserved features of the unique protein kinase nucleotide fold have been defined (9Zheng J. Knighton D.R.

The glycine-rich sequence is located in the small lobe; specifically, it is part of a β-strand-loop-β-strand nucleotide positioning motif (Fig. 1) that is an integral part of the ATP-binding site. This segment serves as a lid to anchor the ATP and to shield the bound nucleotide from solvent. The adenosine is secured beneath the β-strands, and the phosphates of ATP are anchored by the loop through hydrogen bonds to backbone amides. This loop between β1 and β2 is referred to here as the “glycine-rich loop,” as opposed to the “P-loop” of mononucleotide kinases (14Traut T.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 15Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar, 16Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The P-loop also contains several conserved glycines but has a somewhat different consensus and represents a structurally distinct motif even though the common function of both is to anchor the phosphates of ATP. The glycine-rich loop is thought to participate in ATP binding as well as to contribute to catalysis based on several lines of evidence (7Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Sowadski J.M. Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 84-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar,16Bossemeyer D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 201-205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of several distinct substrate and product complexes of the C-subunit, for example, are essentially superimposable with the exception of localized changes within the glycine-rich loop, thus indicating that this is a very sensitive and mobile part of the molecule (17Madhusudan-Trafny E.A. Xuong H.-H. Adams J.A. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 176-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetics also emphasize the potential importance of this region since the rate-limiting step is diffusion controlled and very likely corresponds to the release of ADP (18Cook P.F. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 19Whitehouse S. Feramisco J.R. Casnellie J.E. Krebs E.G. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3693-3701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because the phosphoryl transfer step is 20-fold faster than thek cat (21Grant B.D. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2022-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), localized mobility of the glycine-rich loop is likely to be of great functional importance both for cAPK and for protein kinases, in general. Biochemical analysis of protein kinases carrying mutations within the glycine triad has so far been limited but reiterates the importance of this part of the molecule. In a diabetes-related variant of the insulin receptor kinase the third Gly is replaced by Val, thus impairing tyrosine kinase activity (22Odawara M. Kadowaki T. Yamamoto R. Shibasaki Y. Tobe K. Accili D. Bevins C. Mikami Y. Matsura N. Ahanuma Y. Takaku F. Taylor S.I. Kasuga M. Science. 1989; 245: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). When the third Gly is replaced by Ala in p59 fyn, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, the enzyme has reduced autophosphorylation activity (23Cooke M.P. Perlmutter R.M. New Biol. 1989; 1: 66-74PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylase kinase is one of the kinases with a somewhat atypical glycine-rich loop (LGRGVSSVV) (24Reimann E.M. Titani K. Ericsson L.H. Wade R.D. Fischer E.H. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4185-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of a truncated form of phosphorylase kinase (25Lee J.-H. Maeda S. Angelos K.L. Kamita S.G. Ramachandran C. Walsh D.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10616-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), albeit hampered by the fact that mutant proteins could not be purified extensively, revealed that replacing the first Gly with Ser led to a 75% reduction of enzymatic activity. Restoring a Gly at the third position, however, had surprisingly little effect on overall kinase activity (25Lee J.-H. Maeda S. Angelos K.L. Kamita S.G. Ramachandran C. Walsh D.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10616-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The role of each glycine in the murine C-subunit of cAPK was assessed here using site-directed mutagenesis by replacing each Gly with Ala and Ser. After purifying each mutant protein to apparent homogeneity, its steady-state kinetic properties were characterized. For this comprehensive comparison, it was of particular importance to resolve the specific isoforms of each mutant protein, since correct phosphorylation has been shown previously to be critical for the activity of the C-subunit (26Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Steinberg R.A. Cauthron R.D. Symcox M.M. Shuntoh H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2332-2341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results show a gradation of functional importance for these glycines with Gly-55 being the least important and Gly-52 being most critical. Mutations were introduced into the wild-type murine Cα-subunit gene by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using single-stranded Kunkel template (28Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar) of a Cα/pRSET construct as described previously (29Hemmer W. McGlone M.M. Taylor S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 245: 115-122Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All proteins were expressed as free catalytic subunits. Some mutants were also expressed as polyhistidine fusion proteins. To construct the fusion proteins, the 1.9-kilobase pairNdeI/HindIII cat fragment generated from the Cα/pRSETB construct was subcloned into theNdeI/HindIII sites of pET-15b. Inserts were analyzed for orientation by sequencing, and protein expression checks were done as described previously (29Hemmer W. McGlone M.M. Taylor S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 245: 115-122Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. Mutant C-subunits were expressed in E. coli BL21-DE3. Cells were grown at 37 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.5 to 0.8 and then induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 24 °C for 6 h. Following centrifugation, cells were stored at −70 °C. Cells were lysed with a French pressure cell (American Instrument) using 20 ml of lysis buffer per liter of culture (approximately 5 ml per g of dry weight) at pressures exceeding 1000 p.s.i. Wild-type C-subunit was purified as described previously (30Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,31Herberg F.W. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Mutant proteins were purified by two methods. Method A utilized a slightly modified version of the published procedure using chromatography on phosphocellulose as the initial step followed by chromatography on Mono-S to resolve the isoforms. Alternatively, a newly developed co-lysis method (Method B) was used that is based on rapid holoenzyme formation with a polyhistidine RII-fusion protein, H6RII(R213K) (29Hemmer W. McGlone M.M. Taylor S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 245: 115-122Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This is an altered form of the type II R-subunit that has a mutation in cAMP-binding site A which lowers the cAMP affinity of the holoenzyme. This rapid method was required for those mutants that were more kinetically impaired. After lysis of the cells in buffer A (20 mm MES, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.5), the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × gfor 30 min. All procedures were subsequently carried out at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted to a conductivity of 1.2 mS/cm and incubated batchwise with P11 phosphocellulose resin (Whatman) for 2–3 h, using 5–10 ml of preequilibrated resin per liter of bacterial culture. The resin was gently spun in a tissue culture centrifuge and resuspended in 2 volumes of buffer A. This step was repeated twice. Protein was then eluted batchwise by repeated centrifugation and resuspension each time using 10–35 ml of buffer A containing increasing concentrations of potassium phosphate (80, 150, 250, 375, and 500 mm, respectively). Fractions containing C-subunit, based on discontinuous sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were pooled, concentrated (Amicon PM 30 membranes), and dialyzed directly into buffer B (20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 50 mm KCl. This solution was filtered through 0.22-μm nylon filters and then loaded onto a Mono-S 5/5 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), preequilibrated with the same buffer. Alternatively, to avoid precipitation, protein was dialyzed into buffer B containing 150 mm KCl, filtered, and then diluted with 2 volumes of buffer B immediately prior to application to the Mono-S column. Proteins were eluted using a salt gradient (66 ml) from 50 to 400 mm KCl at 1 ml/min. This procedure was performed as described elsewhere (29Hemmer W. McGlone M.M. Taylor S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 245: 115-122Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In summary, cells that expressed the mutant C-subunit were co-lysed with cells that expressed H6RII(R213K), a mutant form of the RII subunit that has a defective cAMP-binding site A. The combined cell pellets, typically using a ratio of 3R:2C, were resuspended in 20 ml of buffer C (30 mm MOPS, pH 8.0, 5 mm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) per liter of original culture. The cells were lysed as described above and centrifuged. After incubating for 30 min at 4 °C, Ni2+ resin (Invitrogen) that had been preequilibrated in buffer C was added. For each liter of culture overexpressing H6RII(R213K), 0.7–1 ml of pre-equilibrated Ni2+ resin were added. After incubation for 60 min at 4 °C, the resin was recovered by low speed centrifugation and washed twice in 40 ml of buffer C containing 25 mm KCl. The C-subunit was then specifically eluted by resuspending the resin in the same buffer containing 1 mm cAMP. The last step was performed twice. Dialysis and Mono-S chromatography were carried out as described above. C-subunit concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm (A 0.1% = 1.2) and by titrations with PKI, cAMP-free recombinant RI subunit (32Herberg F.W. Dostmann W.R.G. Zorn M. Davis S.J. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7485-7494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and RI(R209K), a mutant RI-subunit that has a defect in cAMP-binding site A (26Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33Bubis J. Neitzel J.J. Saraswat L.D. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9668-9673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variance of the protein concentrations determined by both methods was typically between 5 and 15%. In a few cases the concentrations determined by absorbance at 280 nm were up to 2-fold higher than those determined by titration with either PKI or RI(R209K). This most likely was due to the presence of soluble but inactive protein, since the latter method reflects the concentration of active C-subunit, whereas the absorbance measures total C-subunit. Purity was checked by SDS-PAGE, using 12.5% gels (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Isoforms of each mutant C-subunit were analyzed by analytical native IEF as described previously (31Herberg F.W. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) using Pharmacia, LKB Ampholine PAG plates with a pH range from 3.5 to 9.5. Gels were fixed and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and isoelectric points (pIs) were determined as described. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed basically according to O'Farell (35O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some slight modifications. In summary, the isoelectric focusing was done under denaturating conditions using rod gels (9.2 m urea, 3.8% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% pharmalytes (Pharmacia) 3-10) in a Bio-Rad chamber. Anode and cathode solutions were 0.01m iminodiacetic acid and 0.01 methylenediamine, respectively. Prefocusing was performed at 300, 600, and 1000 V for 30 min each, using a buffer containing 9.5 murea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2% pharmalytes (3Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), and 10 mmDTT. Sample was loaded in the same buffer and overlaid with buffer containing 8 m urea, 5% Nonidet P-40, and 1% pharmalytes before being focused at 1000 V for 16 h. Gel rods were equilibrated in an SDS-containing buffer (60 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 2.3% SDS, 10 mm DTT, pH 6.8). Analysis in the second dimension was done using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). Carbamylated marker proteins (carbonic anhydrase, Pharmacia) were added as internal controls to map precisely the positions of proteins on the two-dimensional gels. The proteins were digested with trypsin and separated by HPLC as described previously (36Yonemoto W. Garrod S.M. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18626-18632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A gas phase sequencer with an on-line phenylthiohydantoin analyzer (Applied Biosystems 470A and 120) was used to sequence the peptides. Electrospray/mass spectrometry (ES/MS) was performed on a Hewlett-Packard 59987A electrospray MS. Proteins were desalted using narrow bore chromatography (Michrom BioResources Inc.) before ES/MS. Kinase activity was measured spectrophotometrically (18Cook P.F. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) using the heptapeptide, LRRASLG (Kemptide), as substrate. This assay couples the generation of ADP with the oxidation of NADH by pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Varying amounts of ATP were preequilibrated with C-subunit in buffer containing 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.3 mm NADH, 1 mmphosphoenolpyruvate, 12 units of lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma), and 4 units of pyruvate kinase (Sigma) in a total volume of 1 ml at 25 °C. The concentration of MgCl2 was 9 mm in excess of ATP in all assays. Reactions were initiated by the addition of Kemptide. Preincubation of C-subunit with either ATP or Kemptide had no effects on the observed initial velocities, and activities were linearly dependent on the amount of C-subunit added. Titrations with PKI or R-subunit were performed by incubating with inhibitor in the assay mix for 2 min prior to the addition of Kemptide. Kemptide and an inhibitor peptide, LRRAALG, were synthesized by the UCSD Peptide and Oligonucleotide Facility and purified by HPLC. Kinase activity was measured at varying concentrations of one substrate and saturating concentrations of the other. Saturating conditions were at least 5-fold above the K m, typically 1–10 mm for ATP and 0.2–0.4 mm for Kemptide. The concentration of MgCl2 was always 9 mm in excess of ATP. K m andk cat values were determined as described previously (37Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plots of initial velocity (v 0)versus concentration of the varied substrates (S) were analyzed by hyperbolar curve fitting according to the Michaelis-Menten equation. LRRAALG is a competitive inhibitor with respect to Kemptide and noncompetitive with respect to ATP (38Yoon M.-Y. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4118-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The K i for LRRAALG was measured by preincubating C-subunit for 5 min with LRRAALG in the assay mix prior to initiating the reaction by the addition of Kemptide. Concentrations of LRRAALG were varied from 0 to 6.2 mm at several fixed Kemptide concentrations. ApparentK i values were determined by plotting reciprocal velocity against the inhibitor concentration. Each determination was measured at Kemptide concentrations below and above theK m . ATPase activity was measured by incubating C-subunit in the above described spectroscopic assay mixture in the absence of Kemptide at ATP concentrations between 1 and 4 mm (at least 10-fold above the Km (ATP)). MgCl2 was 9 mm in excess of ATP. Using a multicuvette holder, the samples (with or without C-subunit) were simultaneously monitored for absorbance at 340 nm. To determine the relative ATPase rate, the C-subunit-dependent ATPase rate was divided by the enzymatic activity, measured as described above using Kemptide as a substrate. All determinations were done in duplicate. Recombinantly expressed wild-type or mutant C-subunit (2.4–7.2 μm) was dialyzed into 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT. Bovine serum albumin (Sigma) was then added to a total protein concentration (C + bovine serum albumin) of 3 mg/ml. The solution was incubated in a polymerase chain reaction thermocycler (PTC-100, MT Research, Inc.) for 3 min at indicated temperatures and then stored on ice and analyzed for catalytic activity at room temperature. Samples were analyzed for thermostability over the range of 25–52 °C either in the absence or presence of 2 mm ATP and 11 mmMgCl2. To investigate the functional importance of the three glycines in the glycine-rich loop, each was replaced with both Ala and Ser. The resulting mutant proteins, referred to as C(G50A), C(G50S), C(G52A), C(G52S), C(G55A), and C(G55S), were expressed in E. coli BL21-DE3. In addition, four mutant proteins were expressed as polyhistidine-tagged proteins and are referred to as H6C(G50A), H6C(G50S), H6C(G52A), and H6C(G52S). Rather conservative mutations were chosen to avoid large structural perturbations. Although the solubility of most of the mutant proteins was significantly reduced compared with wild-type C, expression at 24 °C typically yielded proteins that were at least partially soluble. C(G55A) and C(G55S) were most similar to wild-type C and were purified using phosphocellulose chromatography (Fig. 2). The isoforms, each representing a distinct phosphorylation state (31Herberg F.W.

https://openalex.org/W2136736088,"The A kinase-anchoring protein AKAP79 coordinates the location of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A), calcineurin, and protein kinase C (PKC) at the postsynaptic densities in neurons. Individual enzymes in the AKAP79 signaling complex are regulated by distinct second messenger signals; however, both PKC and calcineurin are inhibited when associated with the anchoring protein, suggesting that additional regulatory signals must be required to release active enzyme. This report focuses on the regulation of AKAP79-PKC interaction by calmodulin. AKAP79 binds calmodulin with high affinity (K D of 28 ± 4 nm (n = 3)) in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Immunofluorescence staining shows that both proteins exhibit overlapping staining patterns in cultured hippocampal neurons. Calmodulin reversed the inhibition of PKCβII by the AKAP79(31–52) peptide and reduced inhibition by the full-length AKAP79 protein. The effect of calmodulin on inhibition of a constitutively active PKC fragment by the AKAP79(31–52) peptide was shown to be partially dependent on Ca2+. Ca2+/calmodulin reduced PKC coimmunoprecipitated with AKAP79 and resulted in a 2.6 ± 0.5-fold (n = 6) increase in PKC activity in a preparation of postsynaptic densities. Collectively, these findings suggest that Ca2+/calmodulin competes with PKC for binding to AKAP79, releasing the inhibited kinase from its association with the anchoring protein.

Protein phosphorylation of intracellular substrates by kinases and phosphatases controls many aspects of cellular function (1Krebs E.G. Beavo J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 43: 923-959Crossref Scopus (1412) Google Scholar). As the individual components of many signaling pathways have been identified, it has become apparent that the regulation of phosphorylation events is achieved at many levels. Although soluble second messengers control the activity state of kinases and phosphatases, other factors influence where and when these enzymes have access to their substrates. Localization of kinases and phosphatases adds a measure of selectivity to their action as it restricts which phosphorylation events occur in response to a particular stimulus. Consequently, several prominent classes of serine/threonine protein kinases and phosphatases are compartmentalized through interactions with anchoring or targeting proteins (2Hubbard M. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 3Mochly-Rosen D. Science. 1995; 268: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 4Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 312-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, protein phosphatase 1 associates with targeting subunits that localize the catalytic subunit and adapt catalytic activity to preferentially dephosphorylate certain substrates (5Hubbard M.J. Dent P. Smythe C. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 189: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Moorhead G. MacKintosh C. Morrice N. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). An emerging family of proteins called AKAPs 1The abbreviations used are: AKAP(s), A kinase anchoring protein(s); PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A); PKC, protein kinase C; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PSD, postsynaptic density; MARCKS, myristolated alanine-rich C kinase substrate. (A KinaseAnchoring Proteins) binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA, localizing the kinase to particular cellular locations, primed for activation by cAMP (for review, see Ref. 7Dell'Acqua M.L. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12881-12884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Some AKAPs bind more than one signaling enzyme. For example, AKAP79 not only associates with PKA but also binds protein phosphatase 2B, calcineurin, and protein kinase C, whereas another anchoring protein, gravin, binds PKA and PKC (8Carr D.W.

Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These multivalent binding proteins serve as scaffolds for multienzyme signaling complexes. We have proposed that these signaling scaffolds preferentially control the phosphorylation of selected substrates such as ion channels and cytoskeletal components through integration of signals from distinct second messengers such as Ca2+ and cAMP (12Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 70: 8-12Google Scholar). However, regulation of these signaling complexes is not fully understood. Although cAMP releases the catalytic subunit of PKA from AKAP79, it is evident that additional regulatory mechanisms must be involved to release inhibited calcineurin and PKC from their association with the anchoring protein. In this report we have focused on the regulation of PKC targeting by AKAP79. Although the PKC family of at least 11 phospholipid-dependent enzymes is activated in response to the generation of diacylglycerol and in some cases Ca2+, most of the isoforms have nearly identical substrate specificities (13Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4231) Google Scholar,14Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Differential localization may contribute to the specificity of PKC action, as a combination of subcellular fractionation and immunocytochemical studies have demonstrated that certain PKC isoforms are found in different cellular compartments (15Wolf M. Burgess S. Misra U.K. Sahyoun N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 140: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Goodnight J. Mischak H. Kolch W. Mushinski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9991-10001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Although localization of PKC primarily involves protein-lipid interactions, it is now apparent that PKC-targeting proteins are also important in directing the location of the kinase to particular parts of the cell (14Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). There are several classes of PKC-targeting proteins: substrate-binding proteins that bind PKC in the presence of phosphatidylserine (17Chapline C. Ramsay K. Klauck T. Jaken S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6858-6861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); receptors foractivated C-kinase which are not necessarily substrates for PKC and bind at site(s) distinct from the substrate binding pocket of the kinase (18Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H. Lopez J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3997-4000Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar); and proteins that interact with C-kinase which have been cloned in two hybrid screens using the catalytic core of the kinase as bait (19Staudinger J. Zhou J. Burgess R. Elledge S. Olson E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that PKC binds AKAP79 in what appears to represent a unique class of PKC-binding proteins. PKC binds AKAP79 in a phosphatidylserine-dependent manner through an amino-terminal basic and hydrophobic sequence and is inhibited by the anchoring protein (10Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We now show that Ca2+/calmodulin antagonizes this interaction presumably by competing for association with this region on AKAP79. This provides a Ca2+-dependent regulatory mechanism for releasing the inhibited kinase from its association with the anchoring protein. Recombinant AKAP79 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli as described (8Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AKAP79 (5 μg) was incubated with calmodulin-agarose (Sigma) (20 μl of packed beads) in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1 mm imidazole, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.05% w/v Nonidet P-40, 15 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) containing 0.2 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed five times with Buffer A containing 5 m NaCl and 0.2 mmCaCl2 and then three times with Buffer A containing 0.2 mm CaCl2. AKAP79 was eluted following incubation with 2 mm EGTA for 1 h at 4 °C. The eluted proteins were boiled for 5 min in SDS-sample preparation buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar), and immunoblotted (21Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44935) Google Scholar). AKAP79 was detected with affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody 918I. This procedure was repeated in the presence of Buffer A containing 0.2 mm EGTA, and proteins were eluted with Buffer A containing 5 mmCaCl2. Biotinylated calmodulin (Life Technologies, Inc.) was coupled to a carboxymethyl dextran IAsys cuvette (Affinity Sensors) via NeutrAvidinTM(Pierce) using standard 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide,N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling chemistry (22Davies R.D. Edwards P.R. Watts H.L. Buckle P.E. Yeung D. Kinning T. Pollard-Knight D. Tech. Protein Chem. 1994; 5: 2985-2992Google Scholar). Briefly, the cuvette was activated by treating with 0.4 m1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (Pierce), 0.1m N-hydroxysuccinimide (Pierce) for 15 min and washed extensively with PBST (PBS containing 1 mmCa2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ (Life Technologies, Inc.) + 0.05% Tween 20 (Amersham)). Excess NeutrAvidin was coupled to the activated cuvette in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, for 30 min at room temperature. Uncoupled protein was washed away with PBST and free amines blocked with 1 m ethanolamine (Affinity Sensors). After washing extensively with PBST, 1 μm AKAP79 recombinant protein was added to check that it did not bind nonspecifically to the cuvette surface. After washing with PBST, 2 μg of biotinylated calmodulin was then coupled to the cuvette via the NeutrAvidin. The calmodulin cuvette was washed with 5 mNaCl and PBST and a stable base line was established for 10 min before data collection. All binding experiments were performed with AKAP79 recombinant protein over a range of concentrations from 5 to 100 nm in volumes of 200 μl in PBST. The binding surface was regenerated with short (1 s) pulses of 6 m guanidinium HCl with no decrease in extent measurements for the duration of the experiments which were completed within 1 day. Data were collected over 3-s intervals and were analyzed using the FastfitTMsoftware which was provided with the IAsys instrument. TheK D value was confirmed with analysis of extent data plotted versus AKAP79 concentration which yielded an equilibrium constant that was in good agreement with theK D obtained from the rate data. Cultured neonatal rat hippocampal neurons grown on coverslips were rinsed with PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde (5 min), and extracted in −20 °C absolute acetone for 1 min. Cells were rehydrated in PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 1 h and then incubated with a mixture containing affinity-purified rabbit anti-AKAP79 antibody 2503 at 1.5 μg/ml and mouse anti-calmodulin antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) at 1.2 μg/ml in PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 1 h. Coverslips were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% BSA and incubated with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:500) (Molecular Probes) and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse (1:250) (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies in PBS containing 0.2% BSA for 1 h. The coverslips were then washed three times in PBS containing 0.2% BSA and mounted with Slow Fade Antifade (Molecular Probes). Cells were analyzed with a Leitz Fluovert FU confocal photomicroscope with a Leitz 40/1.6 N.A. lens. Specific staining was not detected in control experiments with secondary antibody alone. PKCβII, from a baculovirus expression system, was purified as described (23Orr J.W. Keranen L.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15263-15266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was a generous gift of Dr. Alexandra Newton (University of California, San Diego). PKC activity was assayed as described (24Orr J.W. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27715-27718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 40-μl reaction containing 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm[γ-32P]ATP (500 cpm/pmol) with epidermal growth factor receptor peptide (VRKRTLPRL) or PKC(19–31S25) peptide (RFARKGSLRQLNV) as substrates at 30 °C. Assays were performed with or without activators: in the presence of either 300 μmCaCl2 and Triton X-100 (0.1% w/v) micelles containing 20 mol % phosphatidylserine (Avanti) and 5 mol % 1,2-dioleoylglycerol (Avanti), or 2 mm EGTA and Triton X-100 (0.1% w/v), or in the presence of 300 μm CaCl2 and phosphatidylserine (20 μg/ml), or 2 mm EGTA. Triton X-100:phosphatidylserine:diacylglycerol-mixed micelles were prepared as described (25Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4667-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). PKCβII was diluted in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Time course experiments were performed over 15 min with 10 μm AKAP79 peptide plus or minus 10 μm calmodulin. Purified bovine calmodulin was a generous gift of Dr. Roger Colbran (Vanderbilt University). Dose-response curves were generated over an inhibitor concentration range of 0.1–10 μm AKAP79 protein and AKAP79(31–52) peptide in the presence or absence of 10 μm calmodulin. PKC activity was assayed in a preparation of rat forebrain postsynaptic densities, a generous gift of Dr. Roger Colbran (26Rich D.P. Colbran R.J. Schworer C.M. Soderling T.R. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), following incubation with or without calmodulin for 15 min. Assays were performed in the presence of PKC activators: 300 μm CaCl2 and Triton X-100 (0.1% w/v) micelles containing 20 mol % phosphatidylserine and 5 mol % 1,2-dioleoylglycerol and kinase inhibitors PKI(5–25) and KN62. The assays were performed in the presence and absence of PKC(19–36) pseudosubstrate peptide (1 μm). PKCβII (30 nmol) was digested with trypsin (300 ng/ml) (Sigma) in a 15-μl reaction in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 8 min at 30 °C as described (25Orr J.W. Newton A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4667-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated with excess soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and the digested material placed on ice. Proteolytic products were then assayed for PKC activity in the presence of CaCl2 (300 μm) or EGTA (2 mm) plus or minus calmodulin over a range of concentrations of 0.1 to 10 μm AKAP79(31–52) peptide. A partially purified preparation of PKC was prepared from rabbit brain as described (27Woodgett J.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4836-4843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AKAP79 protein (10 μg) was incubated with rabbit brain PKC (2 μg) in the presence or absence of bovine calmodulin in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, Nonidet P-40 (0.5% w/v), 1 mmbenzamidine, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride) containing 1 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated with either affinity-purified anti-AKAP79 918I antibodies (4 μg) or preimmune IgG (4 μg) at 4 °C for 18 h. Immune complexes were isolated by the addition of 100 μl of 10% v/v protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma) which had been equilibrated in hypotonic buffer containing 1 mmCaCl2. Following incubation at 4 °C for 60 min, the beads were washed three times with hypotonic buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 1 m NaCl and three times with hypotonic buffer containing 1 mmCaCl2. The immunoprecipitation experiment was repeated in the presence of hypotonic buffer containing 0.5 mm EGTA. For immunoblot analysis, precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling the washed beads in SDS-sample preparation buffer for 5 min and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% denaturing gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and analyzed by Western blot with an antibody to PKCα/β (Transduction Laboratories). For measuring PKC activity associated with the beads, the washed beads were resuspended in 60 μl of hypotonic buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2 and assayed for PKC activity in duplicate. PKC activity was expressed as fold increase over PKC activity associated with preimmune complexes. We have shown previously that PKC associates with AKAP79, and the principal site of contact lies between residues 31 and 52 on the anchoring protein (10Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). This stretch of alternating basic and hydrophobic residues also resembles a calmodulin-binding domain (28James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 40-44Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (348) Google Scholar). As previous studies have shown that AKAP79 and the bovine homolog AKAP75 are calmodulin-binding proteins (8Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Sarkar D. Erlichman J. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9840-9846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to determine if binding was Ca2+-dependent. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies to AKAP79 demonstrates that AKAP79 binds calmodulin-agarose in the presence of 0.2 mm Ca2+ , and binding is abolished in the presence of 2 mm EGTA (Fig.1 B). This suggests that AKAP79 binds calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. To investigate further the interaction between AKAP79 and calmodulinin vitro, the binding affinity of recombinant AKAP79 to biotinylated calmodulin was measured by surface plasmon resonance (Fig.2). Binding of AKAP79 to immobilized calmodulin in the presence of excess Ca2+ was measured over a range of AKAP79 concentrations (5–100 nm) (Fig. 2 A). Analysis of the association rate data showed that the binding was biphasic, which may result from steric problems or may indicate more than one site of binding. The association rate constant (ka 203,029 ± 24,805m−1 s−1, n = 3) was obtained by plotting the measured k on versus AKAP79 concentration (Fig. 2 B). The dissociation rate constant (kd 0.0055 ± 0.00043 s−1 n = 3) was obtained directly from dissociation experiments. These values were used to calculate a K D of 28 ± 4 nm(n = 3) for the AKAP79-calmodulin interaction. The observed dissociation rate value obtained from the single phase fit of the data is in good agreement with the dissociation rate constant extrapolated from the plot of k on versus AKAP79 concentration (Fig. 2 B). The equilibrium constant of 28 nm is within the physiological concentration range for these proteins and is consistent with the idea that AKAP79 and calmodulin may associate in the cell. Further evidence for the association of AKAP79 and calmodulin was provided by immunofluorescence staining of these proteins in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3). AKAP79 exhibits a distinct staining pattern concentrated at two subcellular locations: at the periphery of the cell body and in dendritic bundles within the neurite extensions (Fig. 3 A). Calmodulin staining is similar, with staining at the periphery of the cell body and in the neurite extensions, although the calmodulin is more uniformly distributed throughout the neurites, and there is also staining in the nucleus of the cell (Fig. 3 B). Double labeling experiments show considerable overlap of staining at the periphery of the cell and in neurite extensions, demonstrating that these proteins occupy the same focal plane (Fig. 3 C). Collectively, these findings suggest that AKAP79 interacts with calmodulin, and it is feasible that this interaction occurs in vivo. The region on AKAP79 which binds PKC resembles a calmodulin binding sequence (Fig.1 A). The idea that calmodulin and PKC may share common binding determinants suggested the intriguing possibility that Ca2+/calmodulin may play a role in regulating the interaction of PKC with AKAP79. We therefore investigated the effect of Ca2+/calmodulin on the inhibition of PKC activity by AKAP79. AKAP79 and a peptide encompassing residues 31–52 of the anchoring protein inhibit PKC activity (10Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Addition of Ca2+/calmodulin to the reaction releases PKC activity so that it is no longer inhibited by AKAP79 (Fig. 4). Fig.4 A shows a time course of PKC activity. PKC activity increases in a linear fashion over 15 min. In the presence of the AKAP79(31–52) peptide (10 μm), PKC activity is inhibited; however, addition of 10 μm calmodulin prevents inhibition of PKC activity (Fig. 4 A). Since calmodulin alone does not affect the activity of PKC (data not shown), it is likely that calmodulin competes for binding to the AKAP79(31–52) peptide. Similarly, PKC activity is inhibited by AKAP79(31–52) peptide in a concentration-dependent manner; but when 10 μm calmodulin is added, the peptide no longer inhibits PKC activity (Fig. 4 B). The relief of inhibition by AKAP79(31–52) in the presence of calmodulin is specific as inhibition by the pseudosubstrate PKC(19–36) peptide is not affected by calmodulin (data not shown). When AKAP79(31–52) peptide (100 μm) is present in excess over calmodulin (10 μm), PKC activity is once more inhibited (not shown). These data suggest a potential mechanism of regulation whereby Ca2+/calmodulin competes with PKC for binding to the AKAP79(31–52) peptide relieving the inhibition of PKC activity. Calmodulin also affects the inhibition of PKC by the recombinant AKAP79 protein (Fig. 4 C). Addition of 10 μmcalmodulin causes a shift in the dose-response curve such that the inhibition is reduced. Interestingly, this effect is not as dramatic as that seen with the AKAP79(31–52) peptide, which is somewhat surprising given the high affinity interaction between AKAP79 and calmodulin. However, the binding studies with AKAP79 and calmodulin demonstrate biphasic association, suggesting the potential for binding at more than one site. Thus, calmodulin does not fully prevent inhibition under these conditions. This suggests that calmodulin partially relieves the inhibition of PKC by the AKAP by competing with PKC for binding to AKAP79. Interestingly, the anchoring protein inhibits PKC activity more potently in the presence of phosphatidylserine, and this inhibition is relieved slightly with diacylglycerol/phosphatidylserine micelles (Fig.4 D). Inhibition of PKC by the anchoring protein is relieved to a greater extent in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin with diacylglycerol/phosphatidylserine micelles relative to phosphatidylserine (Fig. 4 D). This suggests that Ca2+/calmodulin as well as the second messenger diacylglycerol may coordinate to relieve PKC from inhibition by AKAP79. As calmodulin binding to AKAP79 requires Ca2+, we wished to investigate whether relief of PKC inhibition by the AKAP79(31–52) peptide was Ca2+-dependent. Since PKCβII activity also requires Ca2+, it was necessary to generate a Ca2+-independent form of PKC. Limited trypsin digestion of PKC was used to liberate the constitutively active, Ca2+-independent catalytic core of the enzyme (Fig.5 A). Inhibition of Ca2+-independent PKC activity by the AKAP79(31–52) peptide was the same as the intact kinase either in the presence or absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5 B). This suggests that the peptide binds at the catalytic core of the kinase, which is consistent with previous kinetic studies on the mechanism of inhibition by the AKAP79(31–52) peptide (10Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Addition of Ca2+/calmodulin (10 μm) resulted in complete relief of inhibition of the constitutively active PKC (Fig. 5 B). Addition of calmodulin in the presence of 2 mm EGTA reduced the inhibition, suggesting that the effect of calmodulin on PKC activity in the presence of the AKAP(31–52) peptide is partially dependent on Ca2+. Having shown that calmodulin reverses the inhibition of PKC activity by the AKAP79(31–52) peptide and reduces the inhibition of PKC activity by the full-length protein, we wanted to look more directly at the effect of calmodulin on PKC binding to AKAP79. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed with an antibody to AKAP79 where recombinant AKAP79 was incubated with PKC in the presence or absence of calmodulin (Fig. 6). Immunoblot analysis demonstrates PKC coimmunoprecipitated with AKAP79 in the presence of either Ca2+ or EGTA (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1and 5). Preimmune serum was used as a control (Fig.6 A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and8). When Ca2+/calmodulin was present, PKC was no longer coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 6 A, lane 3), whereas in the presence of EGTA, calmodulin did not prevent PKC coimmunoprecipitation (Fig. 6 A, lane 7). Thus calmodulin competes with PKC for binding to AKAP79 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. To obtain a more quantitative evaluation, complementary experiments measured PKC activity in immunoprecipitates. Ca2+/calmodulin markedly reduced PKC activity coimmunoprecipitated with AKAP79 (Fig.6 B). This effect was Ca2+-dependent as the presence of EGTA/calmodulin did not reduce PKC activity. These findings support the idea that Ca2+/calmodulin regulates the interaction between AKAP79 and PKC by displacing PKC from its association with AKAP79. On the basis of in vitro experiments, we developed a working hypothesis that Ca2+/calmodulin competes with PKC for binding to AKAP79, thus releasing the kinase from its inhibition by the anchoring protein. This idea is represented schematically in Fig. 7 A. To test this idea in a more physiological context, PKC activity was measured in a preparation of postsynaptic densities (PSDs) (Fig. 7 B). We have shown previously that AKAP79 is enriched at the PSD (8Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure that we were selectively measuring PKC activity, assays were performed using the PKC(19–31S25) peptide as substrate in the presence of the kinase inhibitors, PKI and KN62, to block the activities of PKA and calmodulin kinase II, respectively. PKC activity under these conditions was determined as counts inhibited by the PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide PKC(19–36). The 2.6 ± 0.5-fold (n = 6) increase in PKC activity following incubation with calmodulin (Fig.7 B) is consistent with the idea that calmodulin releases the inhibited kinase from its binding to the anchoring protein. Collectively these findings support a potential role for Ca2+/calmodulin in regulating the release of PKC from anchored sites at the PSD. The anchoring protein AKAP79 coordinates the location of PKA, PKC, and calcineurin (8Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

Targeting of these three signaling enzymes to submembrane sites such as the PSDs of neurons would ensure that each enzyme is well placed to receive signals transduced across the postsynaptic membrane (Fig. 7 A). Although recent mapping studies have provided information on the individual enzyme binding sites on AKAP79, less is known about the regulation of the signaling complex. Our previous studies have shown that all three enzymes are inactive when bound to the anchoring protein (8Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D.

Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Although each enzyme responds to distinct second messenger signals generated at the postsynaptic membrane, additional factors contribute to their release and activation. PKA is directly activated following stimulation by its second messenger signal, cAMP (9Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In contrast, both PKC and calcineurin are inhibited by AKAP79 even in the presence of their respective activators. Although the signals that release calcineurin from its association with AKAP79 remain to be elucidated, we have found that Ca2+/calmodulin may play a role in regulating the interaction between PKC and AKAP79 (Fig. 7 A). This suggests the potential convergence of Ca2+/calmodulin and PKC signaling pathways in the regulation of PKC phosphorylation events at the PSD (Fig. 7 A). In this report we have shown that Ca2+/calmodulin binds AKAP79 with high affinity and influences PKC activity by releasing the kinase from inhibition by the anchoring protein. Our evidence that excess Ca2+/calmodulin overcomes the inhibitory effect of the AKAP79(31–52) peptide on PKC implicates this region as a potential regulatory site on the anchoring protein. This sequence exhibits the hallmarks of a calmodulin binding site in that it is rich in basic and hydrophobic residues (28James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 40-44Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This suggests that calmodulin and PKC share the same or overlapping binding determinants on AKAP79. As AKAP79 is eluted from calmodulin-agarose by EGTA this demonstrates that binding is calcium-dependent. Although we could also purify the AKAP on calmodulin-agarose from bovine brain (9Coghlan V.M. Perrino B.A. Howard M. Langeberg L.K. Hicks J.B. Gallatin W.M. Scott J.D. Science. 1995; 267: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), interpretation of this result is complicated as a proportion of the AKAP is likely to be present through its association with calcineurin which is also a calmodulin-binding protein. However, the nanomolar affinity constant (calculated by surface plasmon resonance) and immunocytochemical data are consistent with the idea that AKAP79 and calmodulin interact inside cells. Kinase activity measurements suggest that calmodulin prevents inhibition of PKC activity by the AKAP79(31–52) peptide but only partially prevents inhibition by the full-length protein. Although this was surprising given the high affinity interaction between AKAP79 and calmodulin, this result may reflect the complex nature of these protein-protein interactions. Since the full-length protein inhibits PKC more potently than the AKAP79(31–52) peptide, we cannot exclude the possibility that there are additional sites of contact on the anchoring protein for PKC which are less affected by calmodulin. Furthermore, calmodulin may bind to more than one site on the anchoring protein. For example, there are three regions on AKAP79 which are rich in basic and hydrophobic residues (8Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D.C. Cone R.D. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16816-16823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the surface plasmon resonance binding measurements indicated a biphasic association of AKAP79 with calmodulin, suggesting that there may be more than one site of interaction. These factors may contribute to Ca2+/calmodulin being less effective when the full-length anchoring protein was used. The partial relief of inhibition by the full-length AKAP79 protein in the presence of calmodulin may also reflect the activation state of PKC when bound to the anchoring protein. PKC is activated following recruitment to the plasma membrane in response to diacylglycerol and Ca2+ (for Ca2+-dependent isoforms) (30Newton A.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6656-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Newton A.C. Keranen L.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6651-6658Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The interaction of PKC with AKAP79 requires phosphatidylserine, which may adapt the kinase to be in a particular orientation for binding. Interestingly, the anchoring protein inhibits kinase activity more potently when phosphatidylserine is present, and this inhibition is partially reversed with diacylglycerol/phosphatidylserine micelles. Thus, it appears that PKC associates with AKAP79 by a mechanism that involves interactions with phosphatidylserine at the plasma membrane, but the presence of the second messenger diacylglycerol weakens the interaction. Although it is clear that binding of diacylglycerol is not sufficient to trigger PKC release, the combination of diacylglycerol and Ca2+/calmodulin may synergize to release fully active PKC from its association with the anchoring protein. In support of this idea, inhibition of PKC by the full-length anchoring protein is relieved to a greater extent in the presence of Ca2+/calmodulin with diacylglycerol/phosphatidylserine micelles relative to phosphatidylserine. The integration of Ca2+/calmodulin and PKC signaling pathways is reminiscent of regulation of the MARCKS protein (32Aderem A. Cell. 1992; 71: 713-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar, 33Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1501-1504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MARCKS binds Ca2+/calmodulin and cross-links actin. Calmodulin binding is dependent on Ca2+ and is prevented by PKC phosphorylation (34Graff J.M. Rajan R.R. Randall R.R. Nairn A.C. Blackshear P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14390-14398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking of actin is disrupted by both phosphorylation and Ca2+/calmodulin (35Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Jammey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). There are several other examples of integration between PKC and calmodulin, such as neuromodulin (GAP43), neurogranin, and adducin. In each case phosphorylation by the kinase prevents association with calmodulin (36Gerendasy D.D. Herron S.R. Jennings P.A. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6741-6750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,37Matsuoka Y. Hughes C.A. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25157-25166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In contrast, calmodulin binding to AKAP79 does not appear to involve phosphorylation. The PKC binding site on AKAP79 does not contain a phosphorylation site, and phosphorylation does not affect PKC binding to the anchoring protein (10Klauck T.M. Faux M.C. Labudda K. Langeberg L.K. Jaken S. Scott J.D. Science. 1996; 271: 1589-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). It therefore seems unlikely that the interplay between Ca2+/calmodulin and PKC is the same as for MARCKS. However, it is striking that there is such a precedence for convergence between Ca2+/calmodulin and PKC signaling events. Our coimmunoprecipitation experiments clearly show that Ca2+/calmodulin reduces PKC coprecipitating with AKAP79. Presumably Ca2+/calmodulin competes with PKC for binding to the anchoring protein. But does this regulation occur in vivo? The high concentration of calmodulin at the PSD (26Rich D.P. Colbran R.J. Schworer C.M. Soderling T.R. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and our evidence for a high affinity interaction between Ca2+/calmodulin and AKAP79 favor a model for Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent antagonism of the AKAP79-PKC interaction. Consistent with this hypothesis are experiments measuring PKC activity from PSD preparations. The idea that the regulatory signal for release comes from a Ca2+-dependent signaling event that does not directly activate the kinase is intriguing. This implies that Ca2+ acts at several places in the release and activation of anchored PKC. For example, calcium influx through channels at the postsynaptic membranes could dictate the release of anchored PKC through calmodulin, independently of kinase activation by lipid signaling, thereby introducing another level of organization for control of PKC phosphorylation events. Analogous to this idea is the finding that calmodulin binding to Ras-related GTP-binding proteins, Kir and Gem, inhibited binding of GTP, leading the authors to suggest that calmodulin-binding motifs may represent an important module regulating protein-protein interactions in signal transduction pathways (38Fischer R. Wei Y. Anagli J. Berchtold M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25067-25070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the data in this article present evidence for Ca2+/calmodulin regulating the protein-protein interaction between PKC and AKAP79. These studies show that one component of the AKAP79 signaling complex, PKC, is regulated by the concerted action of two different second messengers: Ca2+/calmodulin to release the kinase from the anchoring protein and Ca2+/phospholipid, which is required to stimulate enzyme activity. This type of regulation represents another example of synergism between calmodulin and PKC signaling events. An intriguing aspect of this model is that Ca2+/calmodulin is also involved in activating the calcineurin that is also a component of the AKAP79 complex. Future experiments will be designed to test this model inside the cell. We are grateful to Dr. A. Newton for providing purified PKCβII, Dr. R.

Mucus is the layer that covers, protects, and lubricates the luminal surfaces of epithelial respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts. These basic properties are due to the viscous and viscoelastic properties of mucins, the major glycoprotein components of mucus. Mucins constitute a family of high molecular mass glycoproteins synthesized by the goblet cells of the epithelia and in some cases by submucosal glands (for more complete reviews, see Refs. 1Gendler S.J.

It codes for a 3570-amino acid peptide. Nineteen subdomains have been individualized. Most of the MUC5B subdomains show similarity to each other, creating four larger composite super-repeat units of 528 amino acids. Each super-repeat is made up of repeats consisting of an irregular repeat of 29 amino acids, one cysteine-rich subdomain (10 cysteine residues, 108 aa), and one unique sequence of 111 amino acid residues also rich in serine and threonine. The complete organization of the region downstream of the central region of the humanMUC5B gene, i.e. its complete 3′ region, is reported in this paper; we present here the complete genomic nucleotide sequence, the exon-intron organization, and the full cDNA sequence coding for the carboxyl-terminal domain of the human MUC5B apomucin. This domain stretches 808 amino acid residues and can be divided into six subdomains. The last five cysteine-rich subdomains exhibit extensive sequence similarity to MUC2, MUC5AC, and vWF (17Gum Jr., J.R. Hicks J.W. Toribara N.W. Siddiki B. Kim Y.S. J. Biol.

Moreover, with the exception of one substitution, which does not change the coded amino acid, one part of the cDNA sequence we determined is identical to the nucleotide sequence of pSM2-1. This cDNA codes for 196 amino acids in the carboxyl-terminal region of the high molecular weight mucin MG1 isolated from human sublingual gland (37Troxler R.F. Offner G.D. Zhang F. Iontcheva I.

A λgt11 cDNA library constructed from human tracheal mucosa was screened with rabbit antibodies raised to deglycosylated Pronase glycopeptides from bronchial mucins (38Crépin M. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Degand P. Biorheology. 1991; 27: 471-484Crossref Google Scholar). Among the various positive clones obtained, the one designated TH71 and containing a poly(A) tail was of particular interest in the present study. A human genomic λEMBL4 phage library was screened using hybridization with the JER57 probe (25Dufossé J. Porchet N. Audié J.P. Guyonnet Dupérat V. Laine A. Van Seuningen I. Marrakchi S. Degand P.

Open table in a new tab The 5′-AmpliFINDER RACE kit (CLONTECH) was used to synthesize first-strand cDNA from human trachea poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) obtained from CLONTECH using NAU61 as a primer (Table I), followed by ligation of the 5′-ANCHOR adapter. The PCR was then performed using the nested primer NAU67 (Table I and Fig. 1) and the 5′-ANCHOR primer. Nested PCRs involving a second or third round amplification were carried out with 1 μl of the reaction mixture obtained from each previous round of PCR as template. Total RNA of human gall bladder was extracted as described previously (39Glisin V. Orkvenjakov R. Byus C. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2633-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1553) Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNA was performed using the 1st STRAND Synthesis kit (CLONTECH), random hexamers and human trachea poly(A)+ mRNA (0.5 μg) (CLONTECH) or total gall bladder RNA (1 μg). PCR amplification reaction mixtures (50 μl) contain 0.3 mm dNTPs, 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), 15 pmol of the appropriate primers, the buffer system purchased with Taq DNA polymerase, and an aliquot of cDNA. The PCR was performed using a Perkin-Elmer Thermal Cycler 480. PCR parameters were 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 15 min. The amplified products were electrophoresed on a 1% Seaplaque gel (FMC, Rockland, ME) and stained with ethidium bromide. The band was cut out, purified using Preps DNA purification resin (Promega), and subcloned into the T/A cloning vector, pMOSBlue T-vector (Amersham). Thereafter, cDNA clones were subcloned into pBluescript KS(+) vector (Stratagene) using the restriction enzymes (Boehringer Mannheim) PstI,SacI, and/or SmaI. Subclones were sequenced as described below using either universal primers or a series of oligonucleotides specific for both strands of the inserts (TableI). Fragments of the genomic clones CEL5 and BEN2 corresponding to the region downstream of the central exon were subcloned into pBluescript KS(+) vector as described previously (30Desseyn J.L.

The double-stranded plasmid inserts were sequenced manually using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (40Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar) using [α-35S]dATP (Amersham) and Sequenase 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the protocol indicated by the manufacturer. Universal primers or a series of specific oligonucleotides were used. Sequencing reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on 6% polyacrylamide gel (Sequagel-6™, National Diagnostics). The clones were sequenced on both strands several times. Direct DNA sequencing on cosmid was performed as described previously (30Desseyn J.L. Guyonnet Dupérat V. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Laine A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3168-3178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Computer analyses were performed using PC/GENE Software. The whole genomic sequence reported in this paper has been submitted to the EMBL Data Bank with accession number Y09788. The sequence of TH71 has been submitted to the EMBL Data Bank with accession number Y10080. To determine the exact number of repeats in the intron G, first we cut the genomic subclonedBglII-BglII fragment using SacI andRsaI that flank the region containing these direct 59-bp repeats. The complete digestion with SmaI was obtained using 10 units/μg DNA for 3 h. The partial digestions were performed using 1 unit/μg DNA and 0.25 unit/μg DNA for 1 h. After electrophoretic separation on 1.5% agarose gel, the blot analysis was conducted using the antisense oligonucleotide NAU199 (5′- AGAGCCGAGGGGTCTGGG-3′), which had been previously radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) and [γ-32P]ATP from Amersham. The partial restriction maps of the genomic clones CEL5 and BEN2 were determined. Their overlapping parts present the same restriction map. The partial restriction map of the 3′ region ofMUC5B is shown in Fig. 1 together with the overlapping fragments, which were separated and subcloned into pBluescript KS(+) vector. The fragmentsBamHI-SacII and PstI-SacII (in the left part of Fig. 1) contain the 3′ end of the central exon. All these clones were entirely sequenced after restriction digestion and subcloning. Primer walking using specific oligonucleotides (Table I) was also performed. Several cDNA-positive clones were obtained by screening the λgt11 cDNA library using antibodies as described previously (38Crépin M. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Degand P. Biorheology. 1991; 27: 471-484Crossref Google Scholar). The clone designated TH71 is 380 bp in length. Its sequence (Fig. 2), submitted to the EMBL data bank with accession number Y10080, revealed a poly(A) tail with 73 A, 16 bp downstream from a polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA). By sequencing the PstI-PstI subclone (noted with anasterisk in Fig. 1) obtained from the fragmentNotI-BglII of the BEN2 clone, an identical 67-bp sequence was observed (Fig. 2), up to the A where the poly(A) addition occurs, indicating that the clone BEN2 contains the 3′ end of theMUC5B gene. Using the two synthesized oligonucleotides NAU61 and NAU67 chosen in this sequence, a 5′-RACE-PCR experiment was performed. After cloning of the fragment obtained, the insert of 88 bp designated RACE67 was sequenced. This sequence is identical to the 88-bp sequence determined in the PstI-PstI clone (Fig. 2). In contrast, the first 34 nucleotides differ from the sequence of TH71. The TH71 clone, which has been found using the antibodies directed against the repeat part of the MUC5B apomucin (38Crépin M. Porchet N. Aubert J.P. Degand P. Biorheology. 1991; 27: 471-484Crossref Google Scholar), begins with a 132-bp sequence we found in the central exon. Between this sequence and the 3′ end identical to the RACE67, TH71 seems to have been rearranged; moreover, the following results show that an important part of the cDNA has been lost. We will discuss these data below. The NotI-BglII fragment from BEN2 contains two other clustered canonical polyadenylation signals, AATAAA. The first was located about 2 kilobase pairs downstream from the first polyadenylation signal and the second 298 base pairs downstream from this latter AATAAA. The significance of these two additional polyadenylation signals is not known. It will be interesting to determine if several forms of MUC5B mRNA can be transcribed by selection of alternative polyadenylation signals. The dinucleotides TG and GT were found with oligo(T) stretches in the region downstream from the first AATAAA motif within thePstI-PstI subclone. This region, referred to as “GT cluster,” is important for 3′ processing of polyadenylated mRNAs (41Birnstiel M.L. Busslinger M. Strub K. Cell. 1985; 41: 349-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Moreover, the pentanucleotide CATTG was found between the AATAAA sequence and the poly(A) site addition (Fig.3). This CAYTG recognition element has been described to be related to cleavage site selection by Berget (42Berget S.M. Nature. 1984; 309: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The author suggested that pre-polyadenylated RNA hybridized with the AAUAAA recognition element as related to primary site selection, and with CAYUG recognition element within the U4 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins as related to cleavage site selection. Hence,MUC5B combines some common features of the 3′ mRNA processing. From this nucleotide sequence, the new oligonucleotide NAU102 was synthesized to perform RT-PCR.Figure 3Sequence of the 3′ region of the MUC5Bgene.

The locations of the oligonucleotides used in these experiments are indicated in Fig. 1. The oligonucleotide primer NAU151 was designed on the basis of the sequence determined for theBglII-BglII cosmid fragment (Fig. 1). This fragment hybridized with human tracheal RNA on Northern blot and probably contains coding sequences. An amplification product was obtained when the RT-PCR was performed with the two primers NAU151 and NAU102 using human tracheal first-strand cDNA as template. It was designated RT151-102 and is 2209 nucleotides in length. An other RT-PCR was then performed with the following oligonucleotide primers: NAU152, designed with the sequence of RT151-102, and NAU128, chosen in the 3′ end sequence of the MUC5B central exon (30Desseyn J.L.

The resultant 1166-bp amplification product, called RT128-152, and the RT151-102 were cloned into pMOS-Blue T-vector. They were subsequently subcloned into pBluescript KS(+) vector after cutting with the restriction enzymes PstI, SacI, and/orSmaI. The subclones were entirely sequenced on both strands several times using T3 and T7 primers and specific oligonucleotides (see in Table I). The two amplification products RT128-152 and RT151-102 have overlapping sequences of 416 nucleotides. The 3′ region of the human MUC5B gene shown in Fig. 3 encompasses 10,690 bp, of which the first 113 nucleotides correspond to the 3′ end of the central exon we recently published (30Desseyn J.L.

The full-length sequence has been submitted to the EMBL data bank with accession number Y09788. The 3′ region of MUC5B gene is composed of 18 exons ranging in size from 32 to 781 bp (Table II) in good agreement with the mean length of exons (43Hawkins J.D.

The bending moduli were 1.13 × 10−19 erg·cm for CTG and 1.27 × 10−19 erg·cm for CGG, ∼40% less than for random B-DNA. Also, the persistence lengths of the triplet repeat sequences were ∼60% the value for random B-DNA. However, the torsional moduli and the helical repeats were 2.3 × 10−19 erg·cm and 10.4 base pairs (bp)/turn for CTG and 2.4 × 10−19 erg·cm and 10.3 bp/turn for CGG, respectively, all within the range for random B-DNA. Determination of the apparent helical repeat by the band shift assay indicated that the writhe of the repeats was different from that of random B-DNA. In addition, molecules of 224–245 bp in length (64–71 triplet repeats) were able to form topological isomers upon cyclization. The low bending moduli are consistent with predictions from crystallographic variations in slide, roll, and tilt. No unpaired bases or non-B-DNA structures could be detected by chemical and enzymatic probe analyses, two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, and immunological studies. Hence, CTG and CGG are more flexible and highly writhed than random B-DNA and thus would be expected to act as sinks for the accumulation of superhelical density.

Eleven human genetic disorders (including fragile X syndrome, myotonic dystrophy, Kennedy's disease, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 1, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and Friedreich's ataxia) are characterized at the molecular level by the expansion of DNA triplet repeats (CTG, CGG, or AAG) 1For nomenclature of triplet repeat sequences, CTG or (CTG) n designates a duplex sequence of repeating CTG·CAG units, which may also be written as GCT or TGC; the complementary strand may also be written as GCA or AGC.

Expanded alleles undergo further expansions upon passage to offspring and, in some diseases, are associated with the clinical observation called anticipation, whereby the symptoms become more severe in each successive generation and with an earlier age of onset (1Davies, K. E., and Warren, S. T. (eds) (1993) Genome Analysis: Genome Rearrangement and Stability, Vol. 7, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar, 2Bates G. Lehrach H.

Prior investigations suggested that triplet repeat sequences (TRS) 2The abbreviations used are: TRS, triplet repeat sequence(s); bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 2The abbreviations used are: TRS, triplet repeat sequence(s); bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. do not have the properties of random B-DNA. First, CTG tracts greatly facilitate nucleosome assembly (13Wang Y.-H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. Science. 1994; 265: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Wang Y.-H. Griffith J. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 15Godde J.S. Wolffe A.P. J.

Second, DNA synthesis in vitro pauses at specific loci in fragments containing CTG and CGG (16Kang S. Ohshima K. Shimizu M. Amirhaeri S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27014-27021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Third, long tracts of AAG and AGG form intramolecular triplexes that arrest DNA synthesis (17Ohshima K. Kang S. Larson J.E. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16773-16783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fourth, CTG and CGG migrate up to 30% more rapidly than expected on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, whereas their migration is normal on agarose gels (18Chastain P.D., II Eichler E.E. Kang S. Nelson D.L. Levene S.D. Sinden R.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16125-16131Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Fifth, CTG is preferentially expanded in Escherichia coli compared with the other nine TRS (8Ohshima K. Kang S. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1853-1856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Sixth, the frequency of expansions and deletions in E. coli (7Kang S. Ohshima K. Jaworski A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat.

Biol. 1996; 264: 82-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) is influenced by the direction of replication, suggesting the formation of stable hairpin loops in the lagging strand template or the newly synthesized nascent strand. Conformational investigations were conducted on plasmids and restriction fragments containing CTG and CGG to evaluate their role in the biological behaviors described above. Several methods were applied, including circularization kinetics, apparent helical repeat determinations, the rate of migration through acrylamide and agarose gel electrophoresis, chemical and enzymatic probe analyses, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the induction of an immune response. The analyses indicate that both CTG and CGG exist as fully paired, right-handed B-helices. However, their flexibilities are substantially greater than that of random B-DNA, and this causes the TRS to be more writhed. As a result, the average superhelical density of a DNA domain containing a TRS region will be unevenly distributed, a higher density being concentrated within the TRS tracts. This finding in unprecedented and enables the hypothesis that part of the biological response elicited by CTG and CGG is mediated by topological features associated with their increased flexibility. Recombinant plasmids with (CTG) n and (CGG) n inserts used for the cyclization experiments were obtained by cloning a synthetic duplex that had XbaI and BamHI ends flanking (CTG)36 or (CGG)24 into pUC19-NotI cleaved with XbaI andBamHI. The top-strand sequence of the 5′-XbaI → 3′-BamHI insert was TCTAGAGGATCGCTCTTCG(TRS) n CGAAGAGCGGATCGCTAGCGGATCC. 3′ to the TRS was an NheI site (GCTAGC) that allowed the TRS-containing fragments to self-anneal via the complementary CTAG resulting from XbaI-NheI cleavage. Plasmids with longer lengths of TRS were obtained as described (9Kang S. Jaworski A. Ohshima K. Wells R.D. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 19Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 614-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Inserts were sequenced on both strands. Cloning of the 32 plasmids containing (CTG) n and (CGG) n inserts used for the apparent helical repeat determination has been reported (7Kang S. Ohshima K. Jaworski A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 543-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 8Ohshima K. Kang S. Wells R.D. J. Biol.

In addition, five plasmids harboring random sequence DNA inserts were obtained by cloning HaeIII restriction fragments of pUC18 into HincII of pUC19-NotI. In a random-coil chain, the distribution (W) of the end-to-end distance (v) is given by the normalized gaussian function (20Jacobson H. Stockmayer W.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1950; 18: 1600-1606Crossref Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 21Wang J.C. Davidson N. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), W(v)dv=(δ2/π) 3/2exp(−δ2v2)4πv2dvEquation 1 where δ is related to the mean square end-to-end distance (〈v 2〉0) by δ2= 3/2〈v 2〉0(〈v 2〉0 =n i λ−2), n i is the number of statistical segments (Kuhn segments), and λ−1is the length of a statistical segment in Å. The probability (W(0)) that the ends are confined to a volume Vat a distance v (v → 0) is as follows. W(0)dv=(3/2πni) 3/2λ3dVEquation 2 For a linear DNA duplex with cohesive ends, free in solution, the term (3/2πn i )3/2λ3, or J-factor, specifies the concentration of intramolecular ends in dV and is directly correlated to the equilibrium constant K c for the reaction M ⇌ C (K c = [C]/[M]), where C and M are circular and linear monomers, respectively. The association and dissociation rate constants between any two ends are determined by their homogeneous distribution throughout the volume of the system, i.e. by the equilibrium constant for the intermolecular association 2M ⇌ D (K a = [D]/[M]2), where [D] is the concentration of linear dimers. It is assumed that the noncovalent interactions formed during the intramolecular and intermolecular reactions are identical and that the entropy change (ΔS) at the reactive site is the only factor determining the rate constants (no influence from length and composition of the molecule). Under these conditions, K c = K a J, whereby the concentration of circular monomers J is given by the ratio of the intramolecular to the intermolecular equilibrium constants (22Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry.III. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1980Google Scholar). In this formulation, K a = νK*, where K* is the observed equilibrium constant, and ν is related to the permutation number by which the monomers can associate to give the same dimer. Under steady-state kinetic conditions, K c ≅ k 1and K a ≅ k 2 for Reactions A and B, M⇌k−1k1C REACTION A 2M⇌k−2k2D REACTION Bso that the J-factor is defined as the ratio between the two forward rate constants, J =k 1/k 2 (23Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 24Crothers D.M. Drak J. Kahn J.D. Levene S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). k 1 is defined as follows, k1≡−(d[D]/dt)/[D]Equation 3 where [D] [S] [S] + [M], and [S] is the concentration of non-ligated, but hybridized, circles (23Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). To determinek 1, plasmid DNA was cleaved withXbaI, dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, and cleaved with NheI. TheXbaI-NheI fragments containing TRS were isolated on 5–8% polyacrylamide gels, purified, and quantitated by liquid scintillation using the specific activity of free [γ-32P]ATP. 2.1 × 10−10m DNA was incubated in 100 μl of buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 20 min at 20 °C. 5 μl was withdrawn at time 0, and 5 μl of T4 DNA ligase (USB™ specific activity of 6326 units/mg) was added to 95 μl of reaction mixture; 8 μl was withdrawn at 20-s intervals for 4 min and quenched in 8 μl of 100 mm EDTA at 0 °C. Samples were heated at 70 °C for 20 min and loaded onto 5–6% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). T4 DNA ligase was diluted in buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 30% glycerol, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and used at 0.25–3.5 × 10−7m. Three reactions were performed on each fragment at different enzyme concentrations. k 1 was calculated from the slope of the integrated form of Equation 3, where [S] was omitted. It has been shown that [S] contributes only by few percent under these conditions (23Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The products were identified by (a) comparing the migration to that of a reference ladder and (b) assessing the loss of radioactivity due to dephosphorylation of the linear species and the changes in relative percentages following re-cleavage with NheI and/orXbaI. In fact, no restriction sites are regenerated for the circular monomer, whereas all other ligated species contain at least one of the restriction sites. k 2 is defined as follows, k2≡−(d[D]/dt)/[D] 2Equation 4 where [D] = [H] + 2[S], and [H] is the concentration of two distinguishable half-molecules, A and B (23Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). A half-molecule is a linear DNA fragment that can hybridize only through one end, the other end being blunt. Half-molecules of (CGG)24 were obtained by cleaving plasmid DNA withXbaI; filling in with the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I, dGTP, dATP, dTTP, and [α-32P]dCTP; and then cleaving with NheI. Purification and quantitation were as described before. Half-molecules of (CGG)40 were obtained similarly, except that plasmid DNA was cleaved with NheI first and then filled in and cleaved with XbaI. Equimolar amounts (1.5–6.0 × 10−9m) of half-molecules of (CGG)24 and (CGG)40 were mixed in 100 μl of buffer A and processed as described for k 1. Concentrations of T4 DNA ligase were 1 and 2 × 10−6m. Identical procedures were applied to half-molecules of (CTG)36 and (CTG)56. k 2was calculated for the association of (CGG)24 (A) with (CGG)40 (B) and of (CTG)36 (A) with (CTG)56 (B) from the slope of the integrated form of Equation 4 times the initial DNA concentrations. The values obtained were then divided by 2 due to the asymmetry of the molecules. The molarJ-factors (J(m)) were obtained from the ratio k 1/k 2. Note that k 2 is a constant, whereask 1 is unique to each length of DNA. The log J(m) values were plotted against log n bp. Log J(m) is a complex oscillatory function of log n bp. Interpolation of log J(m) with the equations derived by Shimada and Yamakawa (25Shimada J. Yamakawa H. Macromolecules. 1984; 17: 689-698Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar) for the ring-closure probabilities of a twisted worm-like chain yields the bending modulus α, the torsional modulus β, the length of the Kuhn segment λ−1 (λ−1 = 2P, Pbeing the persistence length), and the helical repeath 0 of the DNA. Three successive computational steps were performed. Equations Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8, Equation 9were used as the starting functions to construct the theoretical curve for J 1(L).J 1(L) evaluates the behavior of the contour length of the DNA and is not complicated by the twist dependence of cyclization. The dependence on twist arises from the fact that linear DNA molecules with a non-integral number of helical turns need to untwist (or overtwist) to cyclize.G(0,u 0‖u 0;L) expresses the length-dependent probability of ring closure for a polymer with the end tangents specified. L denotes the reduced contour length, defined as the ratio of the contour length of the DNA chain (n bp × 3.4 Å) to the length of the Kuhn segment, J1(L)=4πG(0,u0‖u0;L)Equation 5 G(0,u0‖u0;L)=π2L−6exp((−π2/L)+0.514L)(forL<1.9)Equation 6 G(0,u0‖u0;L)=(4π) −1F0(L)(for2.8<L≤4)Equation 7 F0(L)=∑k=03f0kL−k−3/2Equation 8 J1(L)=0.03882+0.003494(L−1.9)−0.01618(L−1.9) 2+0.008601(L−1.9) 3(for1.9<L<2.8)Equation 9 where f 0 k are numerical constants. J 1(L) was then transformed into J 1 by the conversion factor 1027λ3/N A (28Koo H.-S. Drak J. Rice J.A. Crothers D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4227-4234Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), whereN A is Avogadro's number. LogJ(m) oscillates around logJ 1. Thus, by varying λ−1 in the conversion factor, log J 1 may be found that runs midway through the log J(m) values. During the transformation, L (x axis) was also converted to log n bp according to the value of λ−1. ς is Poisson's ratio and is related to the bending and torsional moduli by α/β = 1 + ς. ς establishes the upper and lower boundaries for the oscillating logJ(m). Here, r is a periodic function of L (0 ≤ r ≤ 0.5) that reproduces the varying fractional helical turn (and therefore twist) of the DNA chain. For the evaluation of the upper and lower boundaries,r was set equal to 0 and 0.5 to follow the logJ(m) values of DNA fragments with 0 and 0.5 fractional helical turns, respectively. Equations Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12, Equation 13, Equation 14 were used to construct a theoretical J(L)* function, and the previous conversion factor was then used to transformJ(L)* into log J(m)*. J(L)*=∑ΔLk−1=−11JLk(L)(ΔLk=randr±1)Equation 10 Lk, the linking number, expresses the number of times the two helices revolve about one another in circular DNA. This number is always an integer. Lk0 relates to the linking number of a linear DNA in its unconstrained state and needs not to be an integer. ΔLk = Lk − Lk0. ΔTw is the difference in twist between linear and circular DNA. ΔTw = ΔLk + Wr, Wr (writhe) being the measure of the deviation of the helix axis from planarity. For small circles of random DNA, Wr is approximated to 0, so that ΔTw = ΔLk. J Lk(L), the linking number-dependent J-factor, is defined as follows, JLk(L)=8π2G(0,Ω0‖Ω0;Lk,L)Equation 11 andG(0,Ω0‖Ω0;Lk,L), the linking number-dependent ring-closure probability, is as follows, G(0,Ω0‖Ω0;Lk,L)=C0L−13/2exp(−π2/L(1+(ΔLk) 2/(1+ς))+Equation 12 (C1+14)L)with C0=(1+ς) −1/2∑j=07a0j(ΔLk/(1+ς)) 2jEquation 13 C1=∑j=07(a1j(0)+a1j(1)/(1+ς))(ΔLk/(1+ς)) 2jEquation 14 where a 0 j, a 1 j (0), anda 1 j (1) are numerical constants. τ0 is the constant torsion and determines the period of oscillation of logJ(m). τ0 is related to the helical repeat (h 0) of the DNA by τ0 = 2π/h 0 l bp, wherel bp is the distance between base pairs, 3.4 Å. The theoretical J(L) value was evaluated with Equations Equation 10, Equation 11, Equation 12, Equation 13, Equation 14, where r was taken in small increments according to the following, r(L)=‖τ0‖L/2π−k(fork≤∣τ0∣L/2π≤k+12) r(L)=1−‖τ0‖L/2π+k(fork+12<∣τ0∣L/2π<k+1)Equation 15 where k is an integer ≥0. The previous conversion factor was again used to convertJ(L) into log J(m). τ0 was varied to find a good fit to the experimental logJ(m) values. For illustration purposes, logn bp was converted to n bpin the figures. For all of the DNAs, the r + 1 term in Equation 10 was omitted because ‖ΔLk‖/(1 + ς) ≥ 3. This has been shown to cause large errors in the extrapolations (25Shimada J. Yamakawa H. Macromolecules. 1984; 17: 689-698Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Satisfactory values for λ−1, ς, and τ0were estimated by visual inspection of the fits, and no statistical tests were performed. It should be noted that the torsional (β) moduli obtained by these fits were identical to those estimated manually based on pairs of molecules having r (ΔTw) values of 0 and 0.5 (23Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These computations are reported in detail in the accompanying paper (26Gellibolian R. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16793-16797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). 30 μg of plasmid DNA was treated with chicken erythrocyte DNA topoisomerase I at 0 °C overnight and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The resulting set of topoisomers was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. This was performed with 0.5 μg of DNA at 23 °C (60 V for 18 h) on 1% agarose containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.3. The gel dimensions were 20 cm × 22 cm × 3 mm. Positively supercoiled molecules were obtained by relaxing the plasmids at 0 °C and performing the electrophoresis at 23 °C, whereas negatively supercoiled plasmids were generated by relaxation at 37 °C and electrophoresis at 23 °C. Average unwinding was 0.012°/°C/bp. Apparent helical repeat (h 0) was calculated (27Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 200-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) from an average of three determinations (with a S.D. of ±0.1 bp/turn). Methylation of the CGG tracts was performed by treating plasmid DNA withSssI methylase in the presence ofS-adenosylmethionine at 37 °C overnight. To check for complete reaction, cleavage studies with AciI (CCGC) and PAGE analysis were conducted. Chemical probe analyses, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and induction of mouse antibodies were conducted as referred to below. To calculate theJ-factors for the TRS, eight plasmids containing 36–80 consecutive CTG repeats (140–272 bp long) and 19 plasmids containing 24–73 consecutive CGG repeats (104–251 bp long) were prepared (TableI). The TRS-containing restriction fragments had a protruding CTAG at each end that allowed the intramolecular or intermolecular association (Reactions A and B under “Experimental Procedures”) to take place. k 1 andk 2 were measured under conditions in which the intermediates C and D were converted into covalently closed products by T4 DNA ligase (23Shore D. Baldwin R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 170: 957-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows representative time course reactions and plots. For k 2, two molecules of different lengths were chosen and blunted at one end. This scheme enables the molecules to dimerize via the single CTAG end, but disallows the intramolecular circularization. Fig. 1 A shows a PAGE separation of the products between (CGG)24 and (CGG)40. Three ligated species were observed, which correspond to dimers of (CGG)24, dimers of (CGG)24 and (CGG)40, and dimers of (CGG)40 in the ratio of 1:2:1 (20Jacobson H. Stockmayer W.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1950; 18: 1600-1606Crossref Scopus (1281) Google Scholar, 25Shimada J. Yamakawa H. Macromolecules. 1984; 17: 689-698Crossref Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In general, higher order aggregates were also detected at concentrations within a few percent of the linear dimers. These aggregates may have originated from blunt-end ligations.Table IPlasmids containing CTG · CAG and CGG · CCG inserts used for cyclization kinetic studiesTriplet repeatPlasmidNo. of repeatsSize of fragments1-aDue to the presence of cohesive ends on the fragments, the total number of base pairs is the number of bases in one strand of the DNA.bp(CTG) npRW303636140pRW304747173pRW305454194pRW305656200pRW305959209pRW306464224pRW306868236pRW308080272(CGG) npRW365124104pRW366129119pRW367132128pRW367534134pRW368140152pRW367943161pRW365344164pRW367746170pRW368349179pRW369752188pRW369956200pRW368957203pRW368559209pRW368760212pRW369362218pRW369563221pRW367370242pRW365571245pRW369173251After cleavage by XbaI and NheI the purified inserts have the following 5′ → 3′ top-strand sequence organization: a 5′-protruding CTAG followed by duplex AGGATCGCTCTTCG(TRS) n CGAAGAGCGGATCG and finally a 3′-recessive GATC.

Its physiological activation requires a transmembrane electrochemical proton potential difference (1Strotmann H. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 1974; 347: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Hence, the proton gradient in addition to its role as the driving force of phosphorylation is a factor that controls CF0CF1 activity. The obvious physiological meaning of this control mechanism is the suppression of unproductive ATP hydrolysis under conditions that would energetically allow this reaction, i.e. at low proton gradients (low light or dark) and high phosphate potentials. A superimposed regulatory device is the so-called thiol modulation of CF0CF1. The structural basis for thiol modulation is a sequence motif of nine amino acids comprising two cysteines in the γ subunit of CF1 (5Moroney J.V. Fullmer C.S. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7281-7285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This segment is present in higher plants (6Miki J. Maeda Y. Mukuhata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and green algae (7Yu L.M. Selman B.R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 320: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) suggesting that thiol modulation is an acquisition of the chlorophyll a +b plants only. In the demodulated (oxidized) state the two cysteines form a disulfide bond whereas the modulated state is obtained by reduction of this disulfide bridge. In vitro reduction can be achieved by dithiothreitol or other dithiols, but the natural reductant is a reduced thioredoxin. In chloroplasts at least two different thioredoxins occur, thioredoxin-m (Tr-m) and thioredoxin-f (Tr-f) (12Jacquot J.-P. Vidal J. Gadal P. Schürmann P. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 243-246Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The former is thought to be involved in light/dark regulation of the chloroplast NADP-specific malate dehydrogenase, and the latter is responsible for the light/dark regulation of fructose bisphosphatase and other Calvin cycle enzymes (13Buchanan B.B. Wolosiuk R.A. Schürmann P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1979; 4: 93-96Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 14Wolosiuk R.A. Crawford N.A. Yee B.C. Buchanan B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1627-1632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thioredoxins are reduced via ferredoxin and ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase (15Wolosiuk R.A. Buchanan B.B. Nature. 1977; 266: 565-567Crossref Scopus (236) Google Scholar) by electrons from the photosynthetic electron transport chain. In most of the experiments carried out so far, however, thiol modulation of CF0CF1 was conducted with the artificial reductant dithiothreitol, and in a few studiesEscherichia coli thioredoxin (Trx) was used (16Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1992; 99: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 17Strelow F. Rumberg B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Little information is known about the action of the naturally occurring chloroplast thioredoxins on CF0CF1(18McKinney D.W. Buchanan B.B. Wolosiuk R.A. Phytochemistry. 1977; 17: 794-795Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 19Galmiche J.M. Girault G. Berger G. Jacquot J.P. Migniac-Maslow M. Wollman E.

Thiol modulation requires illumination of the chloroplasts to allow reduction of the disulfide bridge. Apparently, the regulatory segment of the γ subunit, which is hidden in the dark, becomes accessible as a consequence of ΔμH +-induced CF0CF1 activation (16Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1992; 99: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 21Schumann J. Richter M.L. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11817-11823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decay of the proton gradient in the dark leads to deactivation of the ATP synthase. The most significant difference between the reduced and oxidized active states concerns the velocity of deactivation. While the oxidized form is immediately deactivated upon relaxation of the gradient, deactivation of thiol-modulated CF0CF1 takes several minutes. For this reason only chloroplasts with thiol-modulated CF0CF1 are capable of hydrolyzing added ATP after transition from light to dark (22McCarty R.E. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 129-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Carmeli C. Lifshitz Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 86-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Deactivation of the modulated enzyme may proceed with or without reoxidation of the dithiol group (16Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1992; 99: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Most likely the natural actual oxidant is the oxidized form of thioredoxin. Hence at least four CF0CF1 forms may be discerned: the oxidized inactive (E iox) and active (E aox) enzyme, and the reduced inactive (E ired) and active (E ared) enzyme. Due to the lower deactivation rate, the equilibrium of active to inactive enzyme is shifted toward lower proton gradients when CF0CF1 is in the reduced form (24Junesch U. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Fast deactivation of the modulated enzyme at light-dark transition is achieved by micromolar concentrations of ADP (25Bar-Zvi D. Shavit N. FEBS Lett. 1980; 119: 68-72Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Schumann J. Strotmann H. Akoyunoglou G. Photosynthesis II. Photosynthetic Electron Transport and Photophosphorylation. Balaban Publishers, Philadelphia1981: 881-892Google Scholar) accompanied with tight binding of the nucleotide molecule to one of the three catalytic sites (27Lohse D. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 94-101Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the present paper the interaction of CF0CF1with thioredoxin is analyzed kinetically, and the thioredoxin specificity for thiol modulation is investigated. The efficiencies can be expressed by rate constants for the binding of the different thioredoxins. Chloroplast thylakoids were isolated from spinach leaves as described in Ref. 28Strotmann H. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 460: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar. The reaction medium contained 25 mmTricine buffer, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm phenazine methosulfate, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 50 nm valinomycin (to cancel the electrical potential difference); the total volume was 2.5 ml. Further additions (dithiothreitol and thioredoxin) are indicated in the legends. The concentration of thylakoids was equivalent to 25 μg of chlorophyll/ml. Recombinant spinach chloroplast thioredoxins were produced as described in Ref. 29Schürmann P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. All experiments were conducted at 20 °C with clamped ΔpH (30Strotmann H. Thelen R. Müller W. Baum W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which was measured by the 9-aminoacridine fluorescence quench (31Schuldiner S. Rottenberg H. Avron M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar) and monitored as described in Ref. 32Kothen G. Schwarz O. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 208-214Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar. The concentration of 9-aminoacridine was 5 μm. The calibration of the fluorescence signal was done as in Refs. 33Lohse D. Thelen R. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 85-93Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 34Van Walraven H.S. Strotmann H. Schwarz O. Rumberg B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar. The activity of reduced CF0CF1 was measured by the initial ATP-hydrolyzing activity at ΔpH 0 following illumination (35Strotmann H. Kleefeld S. Lohse D. FEBS Lett. 1987; 221: 265-269Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since the portion of oxidized active enzyme is immediately discharged at the time of transition to ΔpH 0 but the reduced enzyme retains activity, the resulting ATP-hydrolyzing activity is a measure of the reduced active form only. Usually the thylakoids were preilluminated for 30 s to achieve a steady ΔpH. Then thioredoxin + 0.1 mmdithiothreitol was added while illumination was continued. It was ascertained that 0.1 mm dithiothreitol was sufficient to reduce the thioredoxins completely at all concentrations employed. The insignificant ATPase activity induced by this low concentration of dithiothreitol was always subtracted. After different times of illumination, the light was switched off and a mix consisting of 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP and 0.5 μmnigericin (final concentrations) was injected simultaneously. The initial rate of ATP-hydrolyzing activity was ascertained from the contents of released [32P]Pi in samples taken after 3, 6, 9, and 12 s that were deproteinized by 0.5m HClO4 and analyzed as described in Ref. 36Avron M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 40: 257-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar. Rates have been corrected for isotope dilution (less than 5%) that was caused by the ATP-regenerating pyruvate kinase system. The combined reversible activation/thiol modulation process may be described by Scheme 1. Eiox↔ΔμH+Eaox↔[oxidant][reductant]Eared↔ΔμH+Eired SCHEME1The transition of the active oxidized form to the active reduced form depends on the nature and concentration of the reductant and includes reversible binding of the reductant followed by reduction of the disulfide bridge in the γ subunit. The backward reaction (reoxidation by the oxidized form of thioredoxin (16Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1992; 99: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) is largely excluded under the employed conditions since in all our experiments the thioredoxins were kept reduced by excess dithiothreitol. The kinetic measurements of thiol modulation are based on the suppositions that follow. 1) The ATP-hydrolyzing activity at ΔpH 0 reflects the amount of active and reduced CF0CF1 since only an active enzyme is able to catalyze ATP hydrolysis and only the reduced enzyme retains its activity after transition to ΔpH 0. 2) Thiol modulation requires the enzyme to be in its activated oxidized state. The reduction step is practically irreversible under the employed conditions; all enzyme molecules should become reduced at infinite reaction time independent of the extent of the proton gradient and the thioredoxin concentration. On the other hand, the enzyme activity should depend on the ΔpH to indicate the equilibrium between the reduced active and the reduced inactive form. For a general kinetic analysis we used commercially available Trx from E. coli. In Fig. 1, time courses of thiol modulation are shown at 3 μm Trx and three different extents of membrane energization. The final enzyme activities reflecting the equilibriumE ared ↔E ired increase with increasing light intensity. At ΔpH 2.7 about 50% of the maximal activity is obtained. By acid-base transition Junesch and Gräber (24Junesch U. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) found half-maximal activity of the reduced enzyme at ΔpH 2.2. At ΔpH 2.7 they found about 50% of the maximal phosphorylation rate and concluded that in case the enzyme is in the thiol-modulated form, phosphorylation is limited by the catalytic reaction whereas the activity of the ATP synthase is the limiting factor for phosphorylation when the enzyme is oxidized. More recent results, however, have shown that the “activating protons” cannot be discerned kinetically and that the activating protons show the same cooperativity as the “catalytic protons” (37Groth G. Junge W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hence activation may be a step of the catalytic cycle, and the two processes should have the same ΔpH profile. The apparent difference of the profiles may be due to the fact that the two processes, which have been measured under rather different experimental conditions, are affected differently by factors like ADP or phosphate concentrations (33Lohse D. Thelen R. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 85-93Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The initial rates of thiol modulation likewise depend on the employed ΔpH (Fig. 1). According to the reaction scheme the rate should be dependent on the concentration of active oxidized enzyme molecules present at the beginning of thiol modulation, i.e. on the equilibrium E iox ↔E aox established by preillumination. Accordingly, while the steady-state activities in Fig.1 represent the activation equilibrium of the reduced form of CF0CF1, the initial rates of thiol modulation represent the activation equilibrium of the oxidized form. Compared with the reduced CF0CF1 the activation profile of the oxidized enzyme is shifted toward higher ΔpH values (24Junesch U. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The initial rates and the final levels of thiol modulation likewise depend differently on ΔpH in the expected manner (TableI).Table IParameters of thiol modulation at different extents of the proton gradientΔpHFinal activity of ATP hydrolysis1-achl, chlorophyll.Relative final activityInitial increase of ATPase activityRelative increase of activityμmol P i /(mg chl h)nmol P i / (mg chl s 2 μm Trx)>462014.812.72940.471.20.252.4840.140.080.0171-a chl, chlorophyll. Open table in a new tab According to the results of Junesch and Gräber (24Junesch U. Gräber P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 275-288Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) both activation equilibria should be completely on the side of the active forms at ΔpH ≥ 4. To create clear-cut conditions for the action of thioredoxin, we employed illumination at saturating light intensity to achieve a saturating proton gradient. Saturation was ascertained by the fact that the activity of the oxidized enzyme could not be increased by a further increase of ΔpH. At light saturation the extent of the gradient is well above 4 ΔpH units, but in this range where the 9-aminoacridine calibration curve shows a progressive deflection from linearity, the ΔpH could not be precisely determined. Fig. 2 shows at light saturation time courses of thiol modulation with 0.5 and 3 μm Trx. As expected, the curves show different initial slopes depending on the Trx concentration. Whereas the initial rates are proportional to the concentration of thioredoxin both curves level off at the same final activity. This result permits the conclusions that at saturating ΔpH 1) thiol modulation (at least up to 3 μm Trx) is limited by the velocity of Trx binding, 2) the reduction of CF0CF1 is practically unidirectional, and 3) the equilibrium E ared ↔E ired is far on the left side. This context may be described by Scheme 2. Eaox+Trx→kEared SCHEME2The concentration ofE ared at any reaction timet may be expressed by the equation [Eared]=[Eaox] 0·(1−e−k·[Trx]·t)Equation 1 where [E aox]0 means the concentration of E aox at the reaction start. As pointed out above, [E aox]0 under the employed conditions is assumed to be equal to the total CF0CF1 population. Using the correct molecular weight of the ATP synthase, the amount of CF0CF1 in the thylakoid membrane is 1 nmol/mg of chlorophyll (38Strotmann H. Hesse H. Edelmann K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 314: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). 1 nmol of CF0CF1 per mg of chlorophyll therefore can be expressed by the maximal ATPase activity obtained at infinite thiol modulation time. The curves in Fig. 2present the best fits according to the above equation. The obtained second order rate constants are k = 0.030 s−1 μm−1 (at 0.5 μm Trx) and 0.028 s−1μm−1 (at 3 μm Trx), respectively. Equation 1 predicts that the degree of thiol modulation is an exponential function of both the reaction time and the thioredoxin concentration. In an experiment shown in Fig.3 the degree of thiol modulation as measured by the ATPase activity is plotted as a function of the thioredoxin concentration at three different reaction times. The curves were again fitted according to Equation 1 and yielded the rate constants 0.026 s−1 μm−1 (at 10 s), 0.021 s−1 μm−1 (at 30 s), and 0.020 s−1 μm−1 (at 120 s reaction time), respectively. The mean value including standard deviation of k for Trx from all experiments was 0.024 ± 0.003 s−1 μm−1. Futhermore the efficiencies of the chloroplast thioredoxins Tr-m and Tr-f in thiol modulation are compared with Trx and dithiothreitol. Concentration dependences at 2 min modulation time indicated that under all conditions the same final activity is attained (not shown). In Fig.4 ATPase activities are shown after a reaction time of 10 s in the presence of different concentrations of Tr-f, Trx, and Tr-m. The rate constants calculated from the best fits are summarized in Table II. The results indicate that among the three thioredoxins Tr-f is most efficient followed by Trx and Tr-m. The rate constant for dithiothreitol is at least 4 orders of magnitude lower (Table II).Table IISecond order rate constants for thioredoxins and dithiothreitol in thiol modulationReductantks −1 μm −1Tr-f0.057Trx0.024Tr-m0.010Dithiothreitol1.02 · 10−6 Open table in a new tab Thiol modulation of CF0CF1 in membrana requires illumination of the thylakoids and a dithiol reductant to reduce the disulfide bond in subunit γ. Originally this complex interplay was expressed by the term “light-triggered ATPase” (22McCarty R.E. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 129-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Petrack B. Craston A. Sheppy F. Farron F. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 906-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Now it is clear that light is necessary for CF0CF1 activation and that it is the transmembrane proton gradient that is essential (1Strotmann H. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 97-120Crossref Google Scholar). As a consequence of energization a series of conformational changes occur in CF0CF1. Changes in the region of the nucleotide binding sites located in the α-β subunits lead to the release of tightly bound adenine nucleotides (1Strotmann H. Bickel-Sandkötter S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 97-120Crossref Google Scholar, 2Gräber P. Schlodder E. Witt H.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 461: 426-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 28Strotmann H.

Chem. 1987; 262: 15037-15040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and Lys-109 of the ε subunit becomes accessible to chemical modification by pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (41Komatsu-Takaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2360-2363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise the so-called “light site” of the γ subunit, a cysteine residue in position 89, becomes accessible to modification byo-phenylenedimaleimide (42Weiss M.A. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly the target sequence for thiol modulation, the disulfide bridge formed between Cys-199 and Cys-205 in the γ subunit, is exposed. This domain, which is hidden in the inactive enzyme, becomes available to tryptic cleavage upon activation (43Moroney J.V. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5915-5920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and accessible to reduction by dithiol reductants. At full CF0CF1 activation the pure kinetics of reduction can be measured, and a second order rate constant can be determined. The rate constant depends of course on the nature of the reductant and is much higher for the thioredoxins than for dithiothreitol. In the basic work of Mills et al. (20Mills J.D. Mitchell P. Schürmann P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 112: 173-177Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar) it was shown that Tr-f is active in unmasking the ATPase in thylakoids in the light. The result reported here suggests that Tr-f (rather than Tr-m) is indeed the natural reductant of CF0CF1 in the chloroplast. Tr-m is even less effective than Trx from E. coli. To our knowledge this is the first clear comparative kinetic study of thiol modulation of CF0CF1 in membrana with the natural chloroplast thioredoxins. Galmicheet al. (19Galmiche J.M. Girault G. Berger G. Jacquot J.P. Migniac-Maslow M. Wollman E. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1990; 72: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) compared the effects of Tr-m, Trx, and human thioredoxin on the activation of isolated CF1 and found no differences between the former two, but the human thioredoxin was 10 times less effective. In fact the differences in efficiency between Tr-f, Trx, and Tr-m are apparent at short reaction times. This is due to the fact that reduction of γ is virtually an irreversible reaction provided that the thioredoxins are kept reduced by excess dithiothreitol. Theoretically the process includes two successive reactions, reversible binding of thioredoxin to CF0CF1 followed by the reduction step itself. The formation of an intermolecular complex between isolated CF1 and Trx was measured by Dann and McCarty (16Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1992; 99: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) by using fluorescent probes. They found dissociation constants in the range of 1 μm. Nevertheless the total process including reduction can be described by a single irreversible second order process suggesting that the irreversible reduction step is fast compared with thioredoxin association/dissociation. Accordingly the efficiency may be expressed by the second order rate constant for the association of thioredoxin with CF1. Mathematical simulations of models assuming the reduction step as the rate-limiting reaction could not well explain our experimental data. Compared with dithiothreitol all thioredoxins are by a factor of at least 104 more efficient suggesting that the specific structure or orientation of the dithiol group in the thioredoxins bound to CF0CF1 is essential for high reactivity. The sequences of Tr-f and Tr-m on one hand and Tr-f and Trx on the other hand contain about 30% identical amino acids, but the highest homology is found between Tr-m and Trx (46% identical positions). Accordingly the reactivities in thiol modulation are not well substantiated by the overall primary structures. As the three thioredoxins have the same sequence motif in the region of the reactive dithiol group (WCGPCK), the reactivity might be based on specific amino acid domains located on the protein surface. The three-dimensional structure of Trx fromE. coli shows a central twisted β sheet composed of five β strands surrounded by four α helices. The domain containing the reactive cysteines Cys-32 and Cys-35 is in helix α2. Eklund et al. (44Eklund H. Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. Proteins. 1991; 11: 13-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) proposed that the hydrophobic flat area around the reactive cysteines may form contact with the target protein. The differences in efficiency may be referred to as slight differences in the conformation of this contact area. Recent crystallographic analyses of the chloroplast thioredoxins confirm that they have the same general architectures as the other analyzed thioredoxins. 2G. Capitani, Z. Markovich-Hously, G. del Val, P. Schürmann, and J. N. Jansonius, manuscript in preparation. However, due to their sequences the two chloroplast proteins show quite different surface structures. The surface area of Tr-f around the accessible active site cysteine is not as flat and hydrophobic as that of Trx but quite structured and surrounded by positive and negative charges. These charges are probably instrumental for the proper orientation during the protein-protein interaction. The corresponding surface area of Tr-m resembles much more the one of Trx, except for one boundary area. The fact that Tr-m is less efficient in thiol modulation than Trx may be due to some topological difference between these on the whole rather similar proteins. It might also be due to the replacement in the boundary area of Tr-m of three hydrophobic residues present in Tr-f and Trx by three charged residues: V86(R)/A87(K)/A88(E) (notation ofE. coli-Trx; the corresponding amino acids of Tr-m are in parentheses). These charges may reduce the binding of Tr-m to the coupling factor and therefore be responsible for its lower efficiency compared with Tr-f and Trx."
https://openalex.org/W2007368142,"Genetic expansion of DNA triplet repeat sequences (TRS) found in neurogenetic disorders may be due to abnormal DNA replication. We have previously observed strong DNA synthesis pausings at specific loci within the long tracts (>∼70 repeats) of CTG·CAG and CGG·CCG as well as GTC·GAC by primer extensions in vitro using DNA polymerases (the Klenow fragment ofEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I, the modified T7 DNA polymerase (Sequenase), and human DNA polymerase β). Herein, we have isolated and analyzed the products of stalled synthesis found at ∼30–40 triplets from the beginning of the TRS. DNA sequence analyses revealed that the stalled products contained short tracts of homogeneous TRS (6–12 repeats) in the middle of the sequence corresponding to the flanking region of the primer-template sequence. The sequence at the 3′-side terminated at the end of the primer, indicating that the primer molecule had served as a template. In addition, chemical probe and polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analyses revealed that the stalled products existed in hairpin structures. We postulate that these products of the DNA polymerases are caused by the existence of an unusual DNA conformation(s) within the TRS, during the in vitro DNA synthesis, enhancing the DNA slippages and the hairpin formations in the TRS due to primer realignment. The consequence of these steps is DNA synthesis to the end of the primer and termination. Primer realignment including hairpin formation may play an important intermediate role in the replication of TRS in vivo to elicit genetic expansions."
https://openalex.org/W2036917954,"Based on an improved isolation procedure using perfusion chromatography, trimeric Photosystem 1 (PS1) complexes have been isolated from various deletion mutants of the mesophilic cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803. These mutants are only deficient in the deleted subunits, which was carefully checked by high resolution gel electrophoresis in combination with immunoblotting. These highly purified and well characterized PS1 particles were then examined by electron microscopy, followed by computer-aided image processing with single particle averaging techniques as described earlier (Kruip, J., Boekema, E. J., Bald, D., Boonstra, A. F., and Rögner, M. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 23353–23360). This precise methodological approach allowed a confident localization of the PS1 subunits PsaC, -D, -E, -F, and -J; it also shows shape and size of these subunits once integrated in the PS1 complex. Subunits PsaC, -D, and -E form a ridge on the stromal site, with PsaE toward the edge of each monomer within the trimer and PsaD extending toward the trimeric center, leaving PsaC in between. PsaF (near PsaE) and PsaJ are close together on the outer edge of each monomer; their proximity is also supported by chemical cross-linking, using the zero-length cross-linker EDC. This localization of PsaF contradicts the position suggested by the published low resolution x-ray analysis and shows for the first time the existence of at least one transmembrane α-helix for PsaF. A topographic three-dimensional map has been drawn from this set of results showing the location of the major PS1 subunits (besides PsaA and PsaB). These data also led to the assignment of electron density in the recent medium resolution x-ray structure for PS1 (Krauss, N., Schubert, W.-D., Klukas, O., Fromme, P., Witt, H. T., Saenger, W.

Its main function is the light-dependent electron transfer from plastocyanin (or cytochrome c 6) on the lumen side to soluble ferredoxin (or flavodoxin) on the cytoplasmic or stroma side, thereby transforming light energy into reducing power for various biosynthetic pathways (see Refs. 1Bryant D.A.

Cyanobacterial PS1 consists of 11 subunits, named PsaA to PsaM, with PsaG and PsaH missing, as they are found only in chloroplasts (3Chitnis P.R. Xu Q. Chitnis V.P. Nechushtai R. Photosynth.

Elsevier Science Publishers B. V., Amsterdam1992: 501-549Crossref Google Scholar). The hydrophilic subunits PsaC, -D, and -E are localized on the cytoplasmic side (4Kruip J. Boekema E.J. Bald D. Boonstra A.F. Rögner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23353-23360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and PsaF is supposed to sit on the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane. All the other subunits are integral membrane proteins.In terms of function the initial steps of light harvesting and charge separation are carried out by only three proteins. The PsaA/PsaB heterodimer harbors the primary electron donor P700 (a chlorophyll dimer) and the electron acceptors A0 (a monomeric chlorophyll), A1 (a phylloquinone), and FX (a [4Fe4S] iron-sulfur cluster) in addition to about 100–130 antenna chlorophyll molecules (5Melis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 87-106Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar). PsaC contains the terminal electron acceptors FA and FB (both [4Fe4S] iron-sulfur clusters). The other proteins do not bind any cofactors, but fulfill important functional and structural roles: PsaD and -F have been shown to be candidates for ferredoxin (6Zanetti G. Merati G. Eur. J.

PsaE plays an important role in cyclic electron flow (10Yu L. Zhao J. Mühlenhoff U. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H.

The availability of several deletion mutants (Table I) now enables the extension of these studies to a nearly complete structural analysis of the location of the major subunits of PS1, indicating clearly the position of subunits PsaC, -D, -E, -F, and -J within PS1. In combination with cross-linking data, these electron microscopy data lead to the development of a new topographical map for the location of the structurally and functionally most important subunits of PS1. The excellent resolution of these data was also supported by a major improvement (regarding purification time) of the chromatographic isolation procedure for PS1 using perfusion chromatography; the versatility of this method for speeding up the purification of membrane proteins in general is shown.Figure 5Final results of single particle averaging of trimeric Synechocystis 6803 PS1 projections.

In the present study, the composition and structural organization of type IV collagen of bovine STBM was investigated. STBM was found to be composed of all six α-chains of type IV collagen based upon immunocytochemical and biochemical analysis. The content of α3(IV) chain (40%) and the α4(IV) chain (18%) was substantially higher than in any other basement membrane collagen. The supramolecular structure of the six α(IV) chains was investigated using pseudolysin (EC 3.4.24.26) digestion to excise triple-helical molecules, subsequent collagenase digestion to produce NC1 hexamers and antibody affinity chromatography to resolve populations of NC1 hexamers. The hexamers, which reflect specific arrangements of α(IV) chains, were characterized for their α(IV) chain composition using high performance liquid chromatography, two-dimensional electrophoresis, and immunoblotting with α(IV) chain-specific antibodies. Three major hexamer populations were found that represent the classical network of the α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains and two novel networks, one composed of the α1(IV)-α6(IV) chains and the other composed of the α3(IV)-α6(IV) chains.

Basement membranes (BMs) 1The abbreviations used are: BM, basement membrane; NC1, noncollagenous domain; STBM, seminiferous tubule basement membrane, i.e. extracellular matrix material of the seminiferous tubule lamina propria; α1(IV)/α2(IV), α1(IV) and/or α2(IV); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 1The abbreviations used are: BM, basement membrane; NC1, noncollagenous domain; STBM, seminiferous tubule basement membrane, i.e. extracellular matrix material of the seminiferous tubule lamina propria; α1(IV)/α2(IV), α1(IV) and/or α2(IV); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. are thin sheet-like extracellular structures that compartmentalize tissues. They are substrata for cells of various organs and provide important signals for differentiation, maintenance, and remodeling of tissues. BM function is altered in acquired and genetic diseases, such as Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, Alport syndrome, a form of hereditary nephritis, and diffuse leiomyomatosis, a hereditary disease characterized by benign proliferation of smooth muscle. Type IV collagen, the major constituent of BMs has been linked to the pathogenesis of each of these disorders (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Type IV collagen has recently emerged as a family of triple-helical isoforms consisting of six genetically-distinct chains, designated α1(IV) to α6(IV) (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J.

Each is characterized by a ∼25-residue noncollagenous sequence at the amino terminus, a ∼230-residue noncollagenous (NC1) sequence at the carboxyl terminus, and, between these sequences, a long collagenous domain of ∼1400 residues of Gly-Xaa-Yaa repeats that, together with two other α(IV) chains, forms the triple helix. The first ∼130 residues of the collagenous domain is called the 7 S domain and is involved in tetramerization of triple helical protomers, whereas the NC1 domain is involved in their dimerization. The collagenous domain is interrupted by more than 20 short nontriple-helical regions which are thought to increase flexibility of this collagenous region. Analysis of the α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains reveals that the Gly-X-Y sequences flanking these interruptions are atypical when compared with the remainder of the collagenous domain. The atypical flanking sequences may be important in stabilizing the triple helix and in the formation of polygonal networks in BMs (23Long G.C. Thomas M. Brodsky B. Biopolymers. 1995; 35: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The existence of six α(IV) chains allows for as many as 56 different kinds (isoforms) of triple-helical molecules, which differ in type and stoichiometry of chains. Evidence has been obtained for heterotrimers that have chain composition of [α1(IV)]2α2(IV) and [α3(IV)]2α4(IV) (24Brazel D. Oberbäumer I. Dieringer H. Babel W. Glanville R.W. Deutzmann R. Kühn K.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24533-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whether the α5(IV) and α6(IV) chains occur in some combination with α1(IV) to α4(IV) or in separate molecules remains unknown. The six α(IV) chains differ considerably with respect to tissue distribution. At the protein level, immunochemical studies have shown that the α1(IV) and α2(IV) chains have a ubiquitous distribution whereas the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains have a restricted distribution in both human and rodent tissues (26Ninomiya Y.

At the mRNA level, the relative expression of the α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV) chains varies greatly among a variety of human tissues, including a variation in the ratio of expression of the α3(IV) and α4(IV) chains (16Zhou J. Ding M. Zhao Z. Reeders S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13193-13199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leinonen A. Mariyama M. Mochizuki T. Tryggvason K. Reeders S.T. J. Biol.

Likewise, the kind of triple-helical isoform(s) and their supramolecular organization in BM may be tissue-specific. The α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV) chains have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of human diseases (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol.

In Goodpasture syndrome, the α3(IV) chain is the target for the pathogenic autoantibodies. In Alport syndrome, the COL4A5 gene encoding the α5(IV) chain is mutated in the common X-linked form of the disease, and the COL4A3 and COL4A4 genes are mutated in the autosomal recessive form (1Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In leiomyomatosis, the COL4A5 and COL4A6 genes are deleted in some patients. These mutations together with the restricted tissue expression of chains indicate specific biological functions of the α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV) chains, including a vital role in the molecular sieve function of the glomerular BM and in differentiation of smooth muscle cells. Knowledge of the tissue-specific composition and organization of α(IV) chains of several distinct BMs is of fundamental importance for elucidating the structure/function relationships of these chains and their role in mechanisms underlying diseases. To date, studies on organization have focused primarily on the BM of the renal glomerulus, owing to the well established role of glomerular BM in the molecular sieve function of the kidney and the loss of this function in Goodpasture and Alport syndromes. In the present study, the composition and organization of the α(IV) chains of seminiferous tubule BM (STBM) was investigated. STBM was chosen for study because it appears to have a special role in spermatogenesis, ultrastructural abnormalities are thought to lead to infertility, and temporal studies of the expression of type IV collagen chains show the unique expression of the α3(IV) chain at the initiation of spermatogenesis (34Enders G.C. Kahsai T.Z. Lian G. Funabiki K. Killen P.D. Hudson B.G. Biol. Reprod. 1995; 53: 1489-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results reveal that STBM contains the highest percentage of the α3(IV) chain of any BM collagen thus far studied and that it exists in a novel supramolecular complex comprised of the α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV) chains.

The secondary antibody used in immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting was either rabbit anti-human IgG or swine anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Fresh bovine testes were obtained at a slaughterhouse and quickly frozen on dry ice. Cryostat sections of bovine testis were placed on polylysine-coated slides. The sections were fixed for 10–20 min with cold acetone. To gain access to antigenic epitopes, the cryostat sections were washed in 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and then treated with 6m urea, 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 3.6, for 1 h at room temperature. The sections were washed in 0.15 mNaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and then blocked with 1:1 Blotto (40Johnson D.A. Gautsch J.W. Sportsman J.R. Elder J.H. Gene Anal.

Primary antibodies were added for 2 h at room temperature. Normal serum of the same species as the secondary antibody was added at 2% along with 0.1% Tween 20 to the diluted primary antibody. Primary antibodies were rabbit anti-bovine α1(IV)/α2(IV) NC1 (diluted 1/100 to 1/500), Alport syndrome alloantibodies eluted from a rejected transplanted kidney (36Hudson B.G. Kalluri R. Gunwar S.

Anti-peptide antisera specific for α3(IV), α4(IV), α5(IV), and α6(IV) NC1 were used at a dilution of 1/150 to 1/500. The sections were washed three times in 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and then incubated in peroxidase-labeled goat-anti rabbit IgG (Sigma; diluted 1/1000 to 1/2500) or rabbit-anti human IgG (diluted 1/2000) for 2 h at room temperature. Again 2% normal serum was added to reduce nonspecific binding. The sections were washed three times in 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Diaminobenzidine was used to develop a brown reaction product. The sections were then lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Controls included the substitution of normal rabbit serum for anti-α1(IV)/α2(IV), or the use of no primary antibody instead of Alport syndrome alloantibodies. Sections were examined with a Zeiss Axioskop and photographs made with Kodak Ektar 25 film using an 80A filter. The protocol for preparing STBM sleeves was as described by Enders et al. (41Lian G. Miller K.A. Enders G.C. Biol. Reprod. 1992; 47: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Testes were decapsulated, ground with a meat grinder, and blended to a liquified state with distilled water, 0.05% sodium azide and then shaken for 1 h on ice and pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed three times with the same solution and then suspended in 1m NaCl containing 200 Kunitz units/ml DNase, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% protease inhibitors (42Enders G.C. Henson J.H. Millette C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1109-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and gently shaken for 90 min at room temperature. The solution was pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 10 min and the pellet resuspended in 1% sodium deoxycholate and gently shaken for 1 h on ice. The resulting pellet was washed three times with distilled water. STBM (1 g) was digested with 0.5% pseudolysin at 4 °C for 24 h, and the reaction was arrested by the addition of 20 mm EDTA as described previously (38Gunwar S. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14088-14094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pseudolysin-soluble fraction was separated from enzyme and EDTA by twice precipitating with 20% NaCl. About 20–30 mg of the resulting precipitate was dissolved in 0.15 m NaCl, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and fractionated on a Sephacryl S-1000 gel filtration column equilibrated with the same buffer to remove residual amounts of pseudolysin from type IV collagen components. The soluble fraction represented about 16% of the STBM. Both pseudolysin-soluble and pseudolysin-insoluble fractions of STBM were used for further study. The pseudolysin soluble STBM (20 μg/ml) was sprayed in 0.15 m ammonium bicarbonate, 50% glycerol or 0.05 m acetic acid, 50% glycerol and further treated for rotary shadowing following established procedures (43Langeveld J.P.M.

Samples were examined using a JOEL JEM-100CX II electron microscope. NC1 hexamer was prepared as described previously (44Wieslander J. Langeveld J. Butkowski R. Jodlowski M. Noelken M. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8564-8570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). STBM, pseudolysin-soluble STBM, or pseudolysin-insoluble STBM was suspended in collagenase buffer (25 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, 10 mmCaCl2, 5 mm benzamidine-HCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Bacterial collagenase (0.2% w/w) was added and the suspension stirred continuously at 37 °C for 24 h, followed by addition of 20 mm EDTA to stop the digestion. The supernatant solution, containing the solubilized NC1 hexamer, was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and applied to a DE52-cellulose anion exchange column (2.5 × 35 cm) already equilibrated with the dialysis buffer. The unbound material, which contained the 7 S domain and NC1 hexamer, was concentrated in an ultrafiltration cell (YM 10 filters, Amicon) and fractionated on a Sephacryl S-300 column (2.2 × 81 cm), equilibrated with 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02% sodium azide, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The fractions containing the NC1 hexamer were pooled and used for subsequent studies. One-dimensional SDS-PAGE was performed using the discontinuous buffer system described by Laemmli (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) in a 4–22% gel gradient. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the first dimension was performed according to O'Farrell (46O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol.

Samples for electrophoretic analysis were either lyophilized or ethanol precipitated when necessary. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver as described by Morrissey (47Morrissey J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (2932) Google Scholar). Amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis for α3(IV) NC1 monomer was performed at the University of Kansas Medical Center Biotechnology Support Facility. A lyophilized α3(IV) NC1 monomer preparation was purified by C18 reversed-phase HPLC, derivatized with phenylthiohydantoin, and then identified by use of a 470A protein sequencer with an on-line 120A PTH analyzer. To perform immunoblotting, the SDS-PAGE separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose paper as described previously (43Langeveld J.P.M. Wieslander J. Timoneda J.

Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5889) Google Scholar). Quantitation of hexamer subunits was performed on a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column as described previously (43Langeveld J.P.M. Wieslander J. Timoneda J. McKinney P. Butkowski R.J. Wisdom Jr., B.J.

The identification of subunits in different pools from HPLC was performed by silver staining of two-dimensional electrophoretic gels and by immunoblotting with chain-specific antibodies. Two affinity chromatographic columns were prepared using monoclonal antibodies mAb6 and mAb17, specific for α1(IV) NC1 and α3(IV) NC1, respectively (25Johansson C. Butkowski R. Wieslander J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24533-24537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NC1 hexamers contained in the various affinity column fractions were further analyzed by C18 reversed-phase HPLC as described previously (43Langeveld J.P.M. Wieslander J. Timoneda J. McKinney P.

The localization of type IV collagen chains in testis tissue was determined using chain-specific antibodies (Fig. 1). The α1(IV)/α2(IV) chains were localized to STBM (Fig. 1, Aand B, large filled arrow) and the interstitial extracellular matrices, including blood vessels (Fig. 1 B, open arrowhead). When normal rabbit serum was substituted for anti-αl(IV)/α2(IV) antisera, no specific localization was detected (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the α3(IV) chain was localized to the STBM using Alport alloantibody or Goodpasture autoantibody (Fig.1 C) both of which are directed against the α3(IV) chain (3Saus J. Wieslander J.

Similarly, the α4(IV) and α5(IV) chains were localized to STBM (Fig. 1, F and G). The α6(IV) chain was localized to the STBM and larger blood vessel BM (Fig.1 H). Thus, the α3(IV), α4(IV), and α5(IV) chains are exclusively localized to the STBM and the STBM is comprised of all six α(IV) chains.Figure 5Electron microscopy of pseudolysin-soluble STBM.

To determine the shortest motif sequence required for high level mucin-type O-glycosylation, we prepared more than 100 synthetic peptides and assayed in vitro O-GalNAc transfer to serine or threonine in these peptides using a bovine colostrum UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine:polypeptideN-acetylgalactosaminyl transferase (O-GalNAcT). We chose the sequence PDAASAAP from human erythropoietin (hEPO) for further systematic substitutions because it accepted GalNAc and was a fairly simple sequence consisting only of four kinds of amino acids. Several substitutions showed that threonine is ∼40-fold better than serine as the glycosylated amino acid and a proline at position +3 on the C-terminal side is very important. To define the effect of proline residues around the glycosylation site, we analyzed a series of peptides containing one to three proline residues in a parent peptide AAATAAA. The results clearly indicated that prolines at positions +1 and +3 had a positive effect. The O-GalNAc transfer level of AAATPAP was increased approximately 90-fold from AAATAAA. The deletion of amino acids from the N-terminal side of the glycosylation site suggested that five amino acids from position −1 to +3 were especially important for glycosylation. Moreover, the influence of all 20 amino acids at positions −1, +2, and +4 was analyzed. Uncharged amino acids were preferred at position −1, and small or positively charged amino acids were preferred at position +2. No preference was observed at position +4. We propose a mucin-type O-glycosylation motif,XTPXP, which may be suitable as a signal for protein O-glycosylation.

Glycosylation is an important post-translational modification of proteins in eukaryotic cells, and is divided broadly into three categories of N-linked, O-linked, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored types (1Lis H. Sharon N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Mucin-type sugar chains are the principal structure in various O-linked oligosaccharides.

Although the consensus amino acid sequence Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr (Xaa ≠ Pro) is extensively known in the case of N-glycosylation sites, such a consensus primary amino acid sequence has not been identified among the mucin-type O-glycosylation sites. However, because mucin-type O-glycosylation occurs only at specific serine or threonine residues, it seems that a certain primary sequence or three-dimensional structure must be required for the recognition by O-GalNAcT. Proline residues are found with considerable frequency around glycosylation sites and may play an important role in recognition byO-GalNAcT. Statistical studies by Wilson et al.(14Wilson I.B.H. Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), O'Connell et al. (15O'Connell B. Tabak L.A. Ramasubbu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

J. 1995; 308: 801-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) suggested that prolines occur most commonly at position −1 and +3 from the glycosylated residue (number with − or + refers to a position of amino acid that is N-terminal or C-terminal to a glycosylated amino acid). Elhammer et al. (17Elhammer A.P. Poorman R.A. Brown E. Maggiora L.L. Hoogerheide J.G. Kézdy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10029-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that all proline residues from −4 to +4 may be acceptable forO-glycosylation. Pisano et al. (18Pisano A. Redmond J.W. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 429-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) proposed fourO-glycosylation motifs from the identification of sites in human glycophorin A. One of them, XPXX (at least one X is a glycosylated threonine residue), indicates that prolines at position −1, −2, and +1 may be important. However, these findings have not been fully supported by biochemical studies of the effect of proline residues at each position around theO-glycosylation sites. Some attempts to analyze the influence of the primary sequence using synthetic peptides in vitro have been reported. This method is useful for identifying sequences capable of being glycosylated and for determining the efficiency of O-GalNAc transfer to a certain sequence. By using synthetic peptides derived from bovine myelin, Young et al. (19Young J.D. Tsuchiya D. Sandlin D.E. Holroyde M.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed that the sequences containing TPPP are good substrates and suggested that a triproline sequence C-terminal to threonine might be sufficient for mucin-typeO-glycosylation. However, it has also been reported that peptides not containing the triproline sequence are substrates forO-GalNAcT (15O'Connell B. Tabak L.A. Ramasubbu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Elhammer A.P. Poorman R.A. Brown E. Maggiora L.L. Hoogerheide J.G. Kézdy F.J. J. Biol.

Tabak's group have made efforts to analyze the in vitro GalNAc transfer using more than 50 peptides derived from human von Willebrand factor (hVF) (15O'Connell B. Tabak L.A. Ramasubbu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20O'Connell B.C. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25010-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although they reported that a proline at position +3 is essential and a second proline placed at −1, +1, +2, or +4 is particularly effective, single substitutions from the native sequence are not enough to understand the effect of proline residues in general (20O'Connell B.C. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25010-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar experiments using more than forty synthetic peptides derived from human Muc1 mucin were reported by Nishimori et al. (21Nishimori I. Johnson N.R. Sanderson S.D. Perini F. Mountjoy K. Cerny R.L. Gross M.L. Hollingsworth M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16123-16130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Their findings suggested that a proline at position +3 enhances the glycosylation but is not sufficient and the minimal size of the peptide required for efficient glycosylation is six amino acids from −1 to +4, while Young et al. (19Young J.D. Tsuchiya D. Sandlin D.E. Holroyde M.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) described TPPP as the minimal substrate. These results show that the surrounding sequences of theO-glycosylated amino acid affect the GalNAc transfer remarkably; however, further experiments are needed to clarify the general requirements for mucin-type O-glycosylation. Previously, most studies were complicated by the fact that no distinction was made between single and multiple glycosylations or between serine and threonine as the glycosylated residue. In this report we describe the features of amino acid sequence around single mucin-type O-glycosylation sites by in vitroGalNAc transfer analysis using a series of synthetic peptides. Bovine colostrum O-GalNAcT was able to transfer GalNAc to a short peptide PPDAASAAP (underscore indicates the glycosylated serine) derived from an inherent mucin-type O-glycosylation site of human erythropoietin (hEPO). Subsequent substitutions of the sequence showed the minimal peptide length required for high level GalNAc transfer, the preference of O-glycosylated amino acid, and two influential proline residues at position +1 and +3. From results observed in this study, we propose thatXTPXP is an effective mucin-typeO-glycosylation motif. UDP-[3H]GalNAc (3.7 MBq/ml) and Atomlight were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. UDP-GalNAc and bovine submaxillary mucin were from Sigma. DEAE-Sephacel and CNBr activated Sepharose 4B were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. AG1X-8 (100–200-mesh, Cl− form) was from Bio-Rad. C18 Vydac columns were from Separations Group Inc. Apomucin was prepared from bovine submaxillary mucin as described by Hagopian and Eylar (22Hagopian A. Eylar E.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 128: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The peptides were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase method using an automated peptide synthesizer PS3 (Protein Technologies, Inc.) on a 0.1 mm scale or purchased from Kurabo Co. Ltd. The crude peptides were purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a C18 Vydac column (10 × 250 mm) by elution with a water/acetonitorile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Each purified product displayed a single peak by the reverse-phase HPLC analysis on a C18 Vydac column (4.6 × 250 mm). To quantify peptide amounts and verify their amino acid content, the peptides were hydrolyzed under vapor phase HCl containing 1% phenol at 130 °C for 3 h, and the hydrolyzed materials were then analyzed by a JLC-300 amino acid analyzer (JEOL Ltd.). The purity of each peptide was analyzed on an API III Sciex electron ion spray mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer). O-GalNAcT was purified from 4.8 liters of bovine colostrum by DEAE-Sephacel column chromatography and two steps of apomucin affinity column chromatography essentially as described by Elhammer et al. (5Elhammer A. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5249-5255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activity of the purified fraction was determined by monitoring the transfer from UDP-[3H]GalNAc to an apomucin as described by Sugiuraet al. (3Sugiura M. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9501-9507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm imidazole-HCl (pH7.2), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 μm UDP-[3H]GalNAc (approximately 133,000 dpm), 2 mm synthetic peptide, and enzyme solution in a final volume of 50 μl. The initial velocity of GalNAc transfer to peptide was measured by incubating the mixture at 37 °C from 30 to 480 min, depending on the reactivity of the peptide. The reaction was terminated by adding 50 μl of 250 mm EDTA. The glycosylated peptide was separated from unreacted UDP-[3H]GalNAc on a 1-ml AG1X-8 (Cl− form) column with water as eluent. The 2.6 ml of run-through fraction was collected directly in a glass scintillation vial and supplemented with Atomlight liquid scintillation mixture. The radioactivity was measured by a SE-100 scintillation counter (Packard) for 2 min. Each assay was calibrated with PPASTSAPG and/or AAATPAP as standard. O-GalNAc transfer was assayed using synthetic peptides derived from inherent mucin-type glycoproteins, porcine submaxillary mucin (23Eckhardt A.E. Timpte C.S. Abernethy J.L. Zhao Y. Hill R.L. J.

Sandlin D.E. Holroyde M.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4444-4448Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the peptide PPASTSAPG, which was predicted to be a good substrate from statistical analysis of the mucin-typeO-glycosylation sites by Elhammer et al. (17Elhammer A.P. Poorman R.A. Brown E. Maggiora L.L. Hoogerheide J.G. Kézdy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10029-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were also assayed as substrates for convenience to the comparison with previous results. The results are summarized in Fig.1 A. The transfer of GalNAc was observed in peptides from hG-CSF, bovine κ-casein, hEPO, bovine myelin, and the sequence proposed by Elhammer, while the transfer was not detected in two peptides from porcine and ovine submaxillary mucins. Because the peptide PPASTSAPG was the best substrate, the amount of transferred GalNAc to each peptide was indicated in relative values to this control peptide. The peptide PPDAASAAP from hEPO was more highly glycosylated than other peptides derived from natural mucin-type glycoproteins, and the amount of transferred GalNAc was 8% of the control peptide. The difference between Ser and Thr as a glycosylated amino acid was measured using the sequences from bovine myelin and hEPO. The glycosylation level of the peptide containing Thr was ∼40-fold higher than those containing Ser in both cases (Fig. 1 B). This value is in good agreement with the previously published results for the purified and the recombinant bovine colostrum O-GalNAcT1, respectively (8Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18960-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Elhammer A.P. Poorman R.A. Brown E. Maggiora L.L. Hoogerheide J.G. Kézdy F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10029-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the sequence PPDAATAAP showed higher glycosylation than PPASTSAPG that showed the highest glycosylation in Fig.1 A, it is likely that the surrounding sequence of theO-glycosylation site from hEPO may contain suitable characteristics for the glycosylation by bovine colostrum enzyme. To find a parent peptide for further investigation of the amino acid preference at each position around the glycosylation site, the effect of simplification in the hEPO sequence was analyzed (Fig. 1 C). All alanine substitutions and a deletion of Pro at position −4 decreased O-GalNAc transfer, but Pro at position +3 appears to be critical. This result suggested that certain proline residues that are often observed around mucin-type O-glycosylation sites are very important. The most simplified peptide, AAATAAA, was glycosylated in low level and chosen as the parent peptide. The effective positions of a proline residue were analyzed, and the result is shown in Fig.2 A. Two proline residues at position +3 and +1 increased the transfer level by 33- and 7-fold in comparison to the parent peptide, respectively. A 3-fold increase was caused by Pro at position −1; however, proline residues at other positions did not promote glycosylation. Subsequently, effects of a second proline were measured by adding it to AAATAAP, which was the best sequence in Fig. 2 A. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the second proline at position +1 revealed a synergistic effect to Pro at +3 and increased the transfer level to 90-fold of the parent peptide. While the prolines at position −3 and −2 showed a 2-fold increase from AAATAAP, other second proline residues did not show any effects. In addition, a series of peptides, containing a third proline which was added to two prolines at position +1 and +3, were analyzed (Fig.2 C). No increase from AAATPAP was observed in all cases, and a marked decrease was conferred by Pro at position −1. The kinetic data of several representative peptides are shown in TableI. Substitution of either proline of the sequence AAATPAP by alanine decreased V maxsignificantly, while K m values were comparable. Interestingly, the peptide AAATPPP, containing the third proline at position +2, has a V max higher than that of AAATPAP but also a higher K m . Hence, its catalytic efficiency is the same as that of AAATPAP. The GalNAc transfer to AAATAAA was measurable but too low to determine the kinetic parameters under the conditions used.Table IKinetic constants of proline-containing peptides for O-GalNAc transferPeptideV max/K mK mV maxnmol/min · mmmmnmol/minAAATPAP0.1141.50.17AAATPPP0.1022.90.30AAATAAP0.0322.00.063AAATPAA0.0072.20.016 Open table in a new tab The positive effect caused by two proline residues at position +1 and +3 was analyzed in the case of serine as the glycosylated amino acid. As shown in Fig. 2 D, these two proline residues were effective on the GalNAc transfer to serine, and the importance of proline at each position was similar to the result observed in the transfer to threonine as shown in Fig. 2 (A–C). The influence of deletion in the N-terminal amino acids were analyzed to determine the minimal length required for high level GalNAc transfer. The deletion of alanines at position −3 and −2 reduced the glycosylation gradually but was not fatal (Fig. 3). However, the lack of Ala at −1 made a significant loss of the transfer, suggesting that the amino acid at position −1 is required for efficientO-glycosylation. Because Young et al. (29Briand J.P. Andrews Jr., S.P. Cahill E. Conway N.A. Young J.D. J. Biol.

The results summarized in Fig. 3 disclosed that no effect was detected from the comparison of (Ac)-TPAP with TPAP. In contrast, the peptides containing Ala at position −1, such as ATPAP and ATPAP-(Am), showed approximately 10-fold higher transfer of GalNAc than TPAP. The amidation of C terminus had no remarkable effect. These observations suggested that the minimal length required for high level O-glycosylation is five amino acids from −1 to +3. The influences of amino acid diversity at position −1 and +2, at which proline did not show significant effect (Fig. 2,A–C), were analyzed. The glycosylation was affected considerably by the change of amino acids at position −1 and +2 (Fig.4, A and B). The bovine colostrum enzyme highly transferred GalNAc to peptides containing Tyr, Ala, Trp, Phe, Thr, Ile, Ser, Gly, or Val, but not to peptides containing Lys, Asp, Glu, or Arg at position −1 (Fig.4 A). Therefore, at position −1, it is likely that uncharged amino acids were acceptable while the charged amino acids were unfavorable. It was noteworthy that Tyr, Trp, and Phe having a bulky aromatic ring were preferable as well as Ala, Ser, and Gly having a small side chain. High level transfer was seen when the amino acid at +2 was Pro, Ala, Cys, Lys, Arg, Ser, and His, but low level transfer was detected when it was Asp, Asn, Phe, Trp, Tyr, and Gly (Fig. 4 B). From these results, we presumed that the amino acids with a positive charge or small side chain are advantageous at position +2. Nevertheless, an exception is Gly at position +2, which showed approximately 20% of the glycosylation to AAATPAP. The influence of various amino acids at position +4 was assayed. By contrast to the results of amino acids at position −1 and +2, no remarkable difference on the transfer was observed (Fig.4 C). However, histidine decreased the transfer level to 24% of AAATPAP. During this experiment, several O-GalNAcTs have been purified (3Sugiura M. Kawasaki T. Yamashina I. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9501-9507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Takeuchi M.

Besides the O-GalNAcT1 cDNA, cDNAs of O-GalNAcT2 and T3 have also been cloned from human gastric tumor cell ine MKN45 (11White T. Bennett E.P. Takio K. Sørensen T. Bonding N. Clausen H. J. Biol.

In contrast toO-GalNAcT1, O-GalNAcT2 was purified from a minor fraction containing 5–10% of total O-GalNAcT activity (11White T. Bennett E.P. Takio K. Sørensen T. Bonding N. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24156-24165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and Northern blot analysis showed that O-GalNAcT3 is expressed only in some tissues such as pancreas and testis (12Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It is supposed that these O-GalNAcTs should have different substrate specificity. Detailed analyses on O-GalNAcT2 and T3 should be necessary. We reported here the features of primary peptide sequences required for high level O-glycosylation by a bovine colostrumO-GalNAcT1 in vitro. These results appear to be very useful for the improvement of mucin-typeO-glycosylation efficiency and prediction of the glycosylation sites in glycoproteins. In summary we propose the several motifs for high level O-glycosylation:XTPXP, XTXXP,XTPXX, and XSPXP. They potentially correspond to single mucin-type O-glycosylation sites by O-GalNAcT1. XTPXP is the best motif among them. The substitution analysis of hEPO-derived sequence on GalNAc transfer suggested that mutations of the amino acid sequence around the inherentO-glycosylation site might improve the glycosylation efficiency of intact hEPO in mammalian cells. Indeed, Elliott et al. (30Elliott S. Bartley T. Delorme E. Derby P. Hunt R. Lorenzini T. Parker V. Rohde M.F. Stoney K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11237-11245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported that hEPO mutants of Thr-126 (PPDAATAAPLR) and Pro-127 (PPDAASPAPLR) were almost completely O-glycosylated in COS-1 cells, while wild type glycoprotein (PPDAASAAPLR) was not fullyO-glycosylated. This indicates that the results fromin vitro GalNAc transfer analysis using short peptides can be used to convert an incompletely O-glycosylated glycoproteins to a fully glycosylated glycoproteins. Our results showed that bovine colostrum O-GalNAcT could transfer GalNAc to serine at a low level (Figs. 1 A and2 D), while the GalNAc transfer to threonine of this enzyme was apparently higher than that to serine by 15 to 40-fold in the same surrounding sequences (Figs. 1 B and 2, A–D). This preference of threonine to serine was in good agreement with the previous results of O-GalNAcT1 using sequences from hEPO, bovine myelin, and porcine submaxillary mucin (8Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18960-18965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Elhammer A.P. Poorman R.A. Brown E. Maggiora L.L. Hoogerheide J.G. Kézdy F.J. J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22979-22983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was interesting that the peptide derived from hEPO was more highly glycosylated than peptides from bovine κ-casein and hG-CSF, even though the sequence contained a serine as the glycosylated amino acid. This observation suggested that the surrounding sequence of the hEPO glycosylation site is more suitable than those of bovine κ-casein and hG-CSF. Surveys of the effective proline residues surrounding the glycosylation site clearly showed that two specific proline residues at position +3 and +1 facilitate the glycosylation, but other prolines do not have such significant roles (Fig. 2, A–C). These effects were observed similarly when serine was selected as the glycosylated amino acid in place of threonine (Fig. 2 D). The kinetic studies showed that the effect of these proline residues is onV max rather than K m (TableI). This indicates that proline residues do not enhance the binding energy between substrate and O-GalNAcT. The significance of a proline at +3 in the surrounding sequence of hEPO was consistent with those in hVF and hMuc1 mucin (15O'Connell B. Tabak L.A. Ramasubbu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20O'Connell B.C. Hagen F.K. Tabak L.A. J. Biol.

However, the influence of proline at −1 was not so significant, although statistical analyses by some researchers have suggested that Pro at −1 and +3 might be important (14Wilson I.B.H. Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15O'Connell B. Tabak L.A. Ramasubbu N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1992; 267: 25010-25018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that a second proline placed at −1, +1, +2, or +4 is particularly effective, our data indicated the second prolines at −1 and +2 have little effect. The positive effects of Pro at −1 and +2 observed in their results seem to be caused by the alteration of an unpreferable amino acid to a preferable one, i.e. from Gly to Pro at position +2 (Fig. 4 B). A peptide AAPTPAP showed an apparent decrease from AAATPAP in the GalNAc transfer. While the exact reason is not clear, it might be come from the unfavorable conformation by the introduction with the third proline at position −1. The minimal length required for the GalNAc transfer by bovine colostrumO-GalNAcT was five amino acids from position −1 to +3. While Young et al. (29Briand J.P. Andrews Jr., S.P. Cahill E. Conway N.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 12205-12207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) previously indicated that an amino acid at position −1 might not be required for the in vitroglycosylation from the comparison of (Ac)-TPPP and RTPPP, our results clearly showed that Ala at −1 has a significantly larger effect than the N-terminal acetylation or Arg at −1 (Figs. 3 and 4 A). A deletion experiment of N-terminal amino acids indicated that not only the amino acid at position −1 but also those at −3 and −2 may affect the O-GalNAc transfer (Fig. 3), although no significant differences of the glycosylation level was observed in the substitution from Ala to Pro at position −3, −2, and −1 (Fig. 2, A–C). The in vitro glycosylation of peptides was greatly affected by the substitution of amino acids at position −1 and +2, and a clear preference was observed at each position (Fig. 4, A andB). At position −1, uncharged amino acids were good for the glycosylation and the size of side chain was not involved. The preferable amino acids at position +2 were those with a positive charge or small side chain. The positive charge seemed to be very advantageous in this position, because the side chains of lysine, arginine, and histidine are not so small. Glycine at +2 showed relatively low level glycosylation, even though its side chain is apparently small. The reason for this phenomenon may be come from the specific φ-ψ angle made by glycine. In contrast to positions −1 and +2, no remarkable difference of the glycosylation was observed in the substitution of amino acid at position +4 (Fig. 4 C), suggesting that this position is not so important in the recognition by bovine colostrumO-GalNAcT. We proposed several motifs for mucin-type O-glycosylation byin vitro analysis using a series of systematic synthetic peptides. Because mucin-type O-glycans on glycoproteins have various biological and physicochemical roles, the creation of a newO-glycosylation site in a protein seems to be very useful to improve its delivery and stability. We are currently investigating whether these motifs can work as a signal for mucin-typeO-glycosylation when they are introduced into a protein.

We have explored the possibility that pHA covalently reacts with proteins to form Schiff base adducts, which may play a role in modifying targets at sites of inflammation. Because Schiff bases are labile to acid hydrolysis, prior to analysis the adducts were rendered stable by reduction with NaCNBH3.

Other halides (F−, Br−, I−) and the pseudohalide SCN− could not replace Cl− as a substrate in the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-l-tyrosine system. In the absence of the enzymatic system, pHA-lysine was detected in reduced reaction mixtures of BSA, l-tyrosine, and reagent HOCl. In contrast, pHA-lysine was undetectable when BSA was incubated with l-tyrosine and HOBr, peroxynitrite, hydroxyl radical, or a variety of other peroxidases, indicating that the aldehyde-protein adduct was selectively produced by HOCl. Human neutrophils activated in the presence of tyrosine also modified BSA lysine residues. pHA-lysine formation required l-tyrosine and cell activation; it was inhibited by peroxidase inhibitors and catalase, implicating myeloperoxidase and H2O2in the reaction pathway. pHA-lysine was detected in inflamed human tissues that were reduced, hydrolyzed, and then analyzed by mass spectrometry, indicating that the reaction of pHA with proteins may be of physiological importance. These observations raise the possibility that the identification of pHA-lysine in tissues will pinpoint targets where phagocytes inflict oxidative damage in vivo.

Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies suggest that proteins modified by myeloperoxidase are present in atherosclerotic tissue (30Hazell L.J. Arnold L. Flowers D. Waeg D. Malle E. Stocker R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1535-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that 3-chlorotyrosine, a specific product of myeloperoxidase, is present at elevated levels in human atherosclerotic aorta and in LDL recovered from atherosclerotic aortic intima (23Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Thus, myeloperoxidase may contribute to lipoprotein oxidation in the artery wall. The best characterized product of myeloperoxidase is hypochlorous acid (HOCl), which is generated from chloride ion (Cl−) in a two-electron oxidation reaction (Equation 1; Refs. 21Klebanoff S.J.

Another substrate for oxidation by myeloperoxidase is l-tyrosine, which undergoes a one-electron oxidation reaction to form tyrosyl radical (26Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin.

Tyrosyl radical converts protein-bound tyrosyl residues too,o′-dityrosine and initiates lipid peroxidation, which may render LDL atherogenic (26Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke III, H.L. Goldstein J.A. J.

Recent studies indicate that o,o′-dityrosine is elevated in human atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting that oxidative damage within the human artery wall is mediated, in part, by tyrosyl radical (41Leeuwenburgh C.

We have recently demonstrated that activated phagocytes also employ the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl− system to convert l-tyrosine to the amphipathic aldehyde,p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (pHA). At physiological concentrations of l-tyrosine and Cl−, pHA is the major product of phagocyte activation (28Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1861-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the current studies we examine the ability of pHA to covalently modify proteins and identify the reduced Schiff base between the aldehyde and theN ε-amino moiety of lysine residues. Characterization of this reaction demonstrated that the reduced Schiff base,N ε-(2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl)lysine (pHA-lysine), is acid-stable and serves as a specific marker of protein modification by myeloperoxidase. pHA-lysine was detected by mass spectrometry in inflamed human tissues, raising the possibility that reactive aldehydes generated by myeloperoxidase covalently modify proteins in vivo.

Amino acid analyses were performed at the Washington University School of Medicine Protein Chemistry Core Laboratory. Pre-column derivatization of amino acid hydrolysates with 6-aminoquinoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate was followed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection (47Cohen S.A.

NaOCl (1:1, mol/mol, NaOCl/tyrosine) was added dropwise with constant mixing to 2 mml-tyrosine dissolved in ice-cold 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. The solution was then warmed to 37 °C for 60 min and immediately used for experiments. Preparations were analyzed by reverse phase HPLC prior to use and routinely were ≥95% pure (28Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1861-1867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis of pHA was performed utilizing a C18 column (Beckman μPoracil, 5-μm resin, 4.6 × 260 mm) equilibrated with solvent A (5% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.5). Products were monitored by absorbance (A 276) and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a nonlinear gradient generated with solvent B (90% methanol, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, pH 2.5) as follows: 0–35% solvent B over 10 min; isocratic elution at 35% solvent B for 20 min; 35–100% solvent B over 10 min.N α-Acetyl-pHA-lysine was isolated by reverse phase HPLC with the following gradient: 0–10% solvent B over 5 min; isocratic elution at 10% solvent B for 20 min; 10–100% solvent B over 10 min. Under these conditions,N α-acetyl-pHA-lysine is base-line resolved from pHA-lysine, free pHA, p-hydroxyphenylethanol and l-tyrosine. Production of the protein-bound Schiff base was routinely quantified by reducing the products, subjecting them to acid hydrolysis, and then monitoring for the presence of the stable marker, pHA-lysine (see below). Reactions were carried out under the conditions indicated in the figure legends. Schiff base adducts were reduced by addition of 10 mmNaCNBH3 and incubation for the indicated times at 37 °C. Where indicated, 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.2, was included in the reaction mixture during reduction to scavenge free pHA. Whole human blood anticoagulated with EDTA (5 mm) was diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4; Sigma) supplemented with 0.1 mm DTPA and then modified with myeloperoxidase as indicated in the legend to Fig.6. Following reduction with 10 mm NaCNBH3 in the presence of 100 mm ammonium acetate, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, washed twice with PBS supplemented with 0.1 mmDTPA, and then homogenized on ice with a tight fitting Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The cell lysate was fractionated into soluble and membrane-associated fractions by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C, delipidated with two sequential extractions with water-washed diethyl ether (1:1; v/v), andl-[13C6]tyrosine (300 nmol; a marker of protein content) andN α-acetyl-[13C6]pHA-lysine (20 pmol) were added as internal standards.

Protein (∼250 μg) solutions were dried under vacuum in 2-ml glass reaction vials. Following the addition of 13C-labeled internal standards and 0.5 ml of 6n HBr supplemented with phenol (1%, w/v), samples were alternately evacuated and purged five times with argon gas. The argon-covered solution was hydrolyzed at 120 °C for 24 h. The protein hydrolysate was diluted to 2.0 ml with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied to a C18 column (Supelclean LC-18, 3 ml, Supelco Co.) equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The column was washed with 2 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and pHA-lysine was recovered with 2 ml of 20% methanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were evaporated to dryness under either anhydrous N2 or vacuum prior to derivatization. n-Propyl esters were prepared by the addition of 200 μl of 3.5 mHBr in n-propyl alcohol followed by heating at 65 °C for 30 min. Propylated products were dried under N2, and pentafluoropropionyl (PFP) derivatives were generated by addition of 50 μl of pentafluoropropionic acid anhydride (Pierce) in ethyl acetate (1:3; v/v) and heating for 1 h at 65 °C. Heptafluorobutyryl derivatives were prepared by adding 50 μl of heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride/ethyl acetate (1:4, v/v) and heating for 30 min at 65 °C. Residual material from human tissues obtained for clinical indications was stored on ice and processed within 30 min of collection. Tissue samples were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with reduction buffer (10 mm NaCNBH3, 100 mm ammonium acetate, 1 mm NaN3, 10 μg/ml catalase, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Preliminary experiments confirmed that no additional pHA-lysine was generated under these conditions when samples were supplemented with 20 nm myeloperoxidase and 100 μm H2O2. All procedures involving human tissue were approved by the Washington University Human Studies Committee. Reduced tissue samples were delipidated employing a single phase extraction mixture of H2O/methanol/water-washed diethyl ether (1:3:7, v/v/v) as described previously (23Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). The protein pellet was washed twice with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 0 °C under a fume hood and then subjected to acid hydrolysis, solid-phase extraction on a C18 minicolumn, and derivatization for GC/MS analysis. Amino acids were quantified using stable isotope dilution GC/MS in the negative ion chemical ionization mode. Samples were analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph interfaced with a Hewlett-Packard 5988A mass spectrometer with extended mass range. Injector, transfer line, and source temperatures were set at 250, 250, and 150 °C, respectively. High resolution mass spectrometry was performed with a VG-ZAB SE double-focusing mass spectrometer. The resolution was set at 10,000 with perfluorokerosine as the reference. Amino acids were quantified as their n-propyl, per-PFP derivatives using selected ion monitoring. pHA-lysine was monitored using the base peak at mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 726 (M − HF)−, another major fragment ion atm/z 706 (M − 2HF)−, and their corresponding isotopically labeled internal standard ions atm/z 732 and 712. l-Tyrosine was monitored using the base peak at m/z 367 (M − PFP)−, another major fragment ion at m/z 495 (M − HF)−, and their corresponding isotopically labeled internal standard ions at m/z 373 and 501.l-Lysine was monitored using the base peak atm/z 460 (M − HF)−, another major fragment ion at m/z 440 (M − 2HF)−, and their corresponding isotopically labeled internal standard ions atm/z 466 and 446. Quantification was based on an external calibration curve constructed with each authentic compound and its isotopically labeled internal standard. To ensure that no interfering ions co-eluted with the analyte, the ratio of ion currents of two characteristic ions of each compound and its internal standard were routinely monitored. All amino acids were base-line separated and co-eluted with13C-labeled internal standards. The limit of detection (signal/noise >10) was <1 pmol for all compounds. Analyses were performed at 25 °C in D2O/H2O (1:9, v/v) with a Varian Unity-Plus 500 spectrometer (499.843 MHz for 1H) equipped with a Nalorac indirect detection probe. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to external sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionate-2,2,3,3,d 4 in D2O.

To assess directly the behavior of this loop, we mutated Ser265 of yeast actin to cysteine (S265C) and created another mutant (S265C/C374A) by changing Cys374 of S265C actin to alanine. These changes allowed us to attach a pyrene maleimide stoichiometrically to either Cys374 or Cys265. These mutations had no detectable effects on the protease susceptibility, intrinsic ATPase activity, and thermal stability of labeled or unlabeled G-actin. The presence of the loop cysteine, either labeled or unlabeled, did not affect the actin-activated S1 ATPase activity or the in vitro motility of the actin. Both mutant actins, either labeled or unlabeled, nucleated filament formation considerably faster than wild-type (WT) actin, although the critical concentration was not affected. Whereas the fluorescence of the C-terminal (WT) probe increased during polymerization, that of the loop (S265C/C374A) probe decreased, and the fluorescence of the doubly labeled actin (S265C) was ∼50% less than the sum of the fluorescence of the individual fluorophores. Quenching was also observed in copolymers of labeled WT and S265C/C374A actins. An excimer peak was present in the emission spectrum of labeled S265C F-actin and in the labeled S265C/C374A-WT actin copolymers. These results show that in the filaments, the C-terminal pyrene of a substantial fraction of monomers directly interacts with the loop pyrene of neighboring monomers, bringing the two cysteine sulfurs to within 18 Å of one another. Finally, when bound to labeled S265C/C374A F-actin, myosin S1, but not tropomyosin, caused an increase in fluorescence of the loop probe. Both proteins had no effect on excimer fluorescence. These results help establish the orientation of monomers in F-actin and show that the binding of S1 to actin subdomains 1 and 2 affects the environment of the loop between subdomains 3 and 4.

The crystal structure of the actin monomer has been elucidated as part of a 1:1 complex with three actin-binding proteins (1Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C.

However, the structure of the two-stranded actin filament at atomic resolution has not been determined due to the inability to date to crystallize F-actin. One F-actin model, proposed by Schutt et al. (2Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C.W. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 4Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Myslik J.C. Strauss N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 735-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), is based on the profilin/β-actin ribbon structure in which actin monomers contact each other in a continuous fashion, with profilin molecules bridging between the actins on the outside of the structure. In this structure, actin subdomains 1 and 2 are near the center of the ribbon, whereas the subdomain 3/4 interface is near its exterior. Schutt et al. have proposed that the ribbon can be transformed into a classical ADP-containing helical filament by a compression and a twist. However, coordinates of this filament model have not yet been published. Holmes et al. (5Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) have generated an alternative model based on fitting the coordinates of the monomer into a density map generated from low angle x-ray diffraction studies of oriented actin gels. This model has been further refined by Lorenz et al. (6Lorenz M. Popp D. Holmes K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 826-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and by Tirion et al. (7Tirion M.M. Ben-Avraham D. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 5-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this model, subdomains 1 and 2 are on the exterior of the filament, and the subdomain 3/4 interface is in its interior. In the G-actin structure, a loop consisting of residues 262–274, located between subdomains 3 and 4, is parked against the surface of subdomain 4. At the tip of this loop is a four-residue plug consisting of three hydrophobic amino acids and a glycine. Holmeset al. (5Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) hypothesized that this loop rearranges during polymerization so that it points away from the surface of the protein in a direction perpendicular to the filament axis. The hydrophobic plug at the tip of the loop can now insert into a hydrophobic pocket formed by the interface of two monomers on the opposing strand of the helix, leading to an appreciable increase in the cross-strand stabilization available for the actin filament. Good agreement exists between this model and the results of low resolution structural studies (8Milligan R.A. Whittaker M. Safer D.

However, the model remains in large part unproven. At the existing level of resolution, the proposed interstrand contacts cannot be observed, and no direct experimental evidence exists for this conformational change involving the hydrophobic loop in actin polymerization. A number of groups have previously studied the dynamics of actin polymerization by attaching fluorescent reporter groups to specific sites on Cys374 near the C terminus in subdomain 1 and on Gln41 near the top of subdomain 2 (14Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 16Kim E. Motoki M. Seguro K. Muhlrad A. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2024-2032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, no such studies have been performed with a reporter attached to subdomain 3 or 4 or to the interdomain loop due to the unavailability of a convenient site to attach the probe. Thus, the behavior of this part of the protein during polymerization is unknown. The amino acid sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae actin is 87% identical to that of skeletal muscle actin (17Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2546-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is easy to generate directed mutations in yeast actin, making it an excellent model system for assessing experimentally the validity of the different actin filament models. In this paper, we have mutated Ser265, adjacent to the hydrophobic plug, to cysteine (S265C). We then used this actin to generate a second mutant actin, which, in addition to the S265C alteration, contains a C374A mutation (S265C/C374A). Together with wild-type yeast actin, these mutant actins allow us to assess, separately or together, the behavior of the loop and C-terminal cysteines. We have used these actins labeled with pyrene maleimide to assess changes in the local environment of the loop cysteine during polymerization. We have further studied the interaction of this loop probe with the C-terminal domain of a neighboring actin monomer in the filament to gain additional insight into the spatial arrangement of actin monomers in F-actin. Finally, we have assessed the effects of the binding of myosin S1 and tropomyosin to F-actin on the environment of the pyrene attached to the loop. The site-directed mutagenesis kit and [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Corp. DNase I was obtained from Worthington. Pyrene maleimide, α-chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin were purchased from Sigma. The Sequenase Version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sephacryl S-200 resin was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The BCA assay reagent was purchased from Pierce. The phagemid pRS314 was from Phil Hieter (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). The oligodeoxynucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized in the DNA Core Facility at the University of Iowa (Iowa City, IA). Rabbit actin and myosin were prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to the methods of Spudich and Watt (18Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Godfrey and Harrington (19Godfrey J.E. Harrington W.F. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 886-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Myosin subfragment 1 (S1) was prepared according to Weeds and Pope (20Weeds A. Pope A.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to Smillie (21Smillie L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85B: 234-241Crossref Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The SLM Model 4800 fluorescence spectrometer (SLM-AMINCO, Urbana, IL) used in this work is part of the Protein Structure Facility at the University of Iowa College of Medicine. Plasmids were manipulated by procedures described previously. (22Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.B. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987Google Scholar). The yeast actin coding sequence and the yeast actin promoter were inserted between the EcoRI andBamHI sites in the polylinker region of plasmid pRS314, which contains a TRP1 marker (23Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Single-stranded DNA made from the phagemid with the actin coding sequence was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis together with the oligodeoxynucleotide primer 5′-GTTCCATCCTTGTGTTTTGGGTTTGG-3′ to generate the S265C mutant actin coding sequence (pRS-SC). The mutated codon is underlined. pRS-SC was used to generate diploid yeast cells carrying both the wild-type and mutant actin genes as well as haploid cells containing the mutant sequence as the only actin coding sequence in the cell (24Cook R.K. Sheff D. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequencing of the plasmid reisolated from the yeast verified that the transformed cells contained the desired mutation. We next constructed a mutated actin plasmid with the codon for Cys374 changed to that of Ala (pGEM-CA). The single-stranded DNA template was generated from phagemid pGEM-ACT, a derivative of pGEM-3Z(−), into which the actin coding sequence was inserted in the polylinker region between the BamHI andEcoRI sites, and the mutagenic oligodeoxynucleotide was 5′-ATCGTTCACAAGGCTTTCTAATCTCTG-3′. We next constructed a doubly mutated plasmid containing the S265C and C374A mutations. The 3′-end of the C374A mutant actin coding sequence was excised from plasmid pGEM-CA with EcoRI and KpnI. The excised fragment containing the C374A mutation was subcloned into plasmid pRS-SC, which had been purified after a similar digestion. The resulting plasmid, pRS-SCCA, was used to generate haploid cells containing the mutant sequence as the only actin coding sequence. S. cerevisiae strain TDyDD was a gift of Dr. D. Shortle (The Johns Hopkins University). It is a diploid cell in which one actin allele has been partially deleted and marked with theLEU2 gene (24Cook R.K. Sheff D. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The haploid yeast strain hTDyDD generated from TDyDD contains a chromosomal actin gene interrupted with theLEU2 gene and a centromeric plasmid, marked with theURA3 gene, containing WT 1The abbreviations used are: WT, wild-type; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl. yeast actin and its promoter. This yeast strain was transformed with pRS-SC or pRS-SCCA (25Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed colonies were selected for growth on agar plates lacking tryptophan. Haploid cells with a Ura−and Trp+ phenotype were isolated. To verify that these cells contained the plasmid with the proper mutant sequence, we reisolated the plasmids from the yeast and sequenced the actin coding sequence. Yeast cells were grown in liquid YPD medium (2% Bacto-peptone, 1% yeast extract, and 2% glucose), on solid YPD (2% agar in liquid YPD), or in liquid or solid defined medium. To determine generation times, cells grown in YPD medium overnight were diluted into fresh medium preincubated at the desired temperature and incubated at the same temperature in a shaker. Aliquots were taken at desired intervals, and the cell density was measured using theA 600. Wild-type and mutant cells were analyzed simultaneously in parallel cultures. Growth curves were then constructed by plotting the log of A 600 versus time. To test the ability of the cells to grow in hyperosmolar medium or in ethylene glycol-containing medium, cells grown on YPD plates at 30 °C for 2 days were then replica-plated onto YPD plates, onto hyperosmolar plates (YPD medium with 0.9m NaCl), or onto YEP plates (YPD medium with 1.8m ethylene glycol instead of glucose). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 2 days and then photographed. The growth curves for each strain growing in liquid hyperosmolar or YEP medium were also obtained. WT and mutant actins were purified in the Ca2+ G-form using a DNase I affinity chromatography procedure (24Cook R.K. Sheff D. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16825-16833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was further purified by passage over a Sephacryl S-200 column equilibrated in Ca2+ G-buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and retention of the middle fractions of the actin peak. Mg2+ G-actin was obtained from the Ca2+ G-actin by the procedure of Pollard and Cooper (26Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mg2+ G-buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.05 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. We obtained only about one-third to one-half the amount of S265C/C374A actin as we did WT or S265C actin, although by Western analysis, the amount of actin/cell weight was about the same in all cases. Light scattering was measured in an SLM Model 4800 fluorometer set at 360 nm for both the excitation and emission wavelengths. After isolation, actins were further purified by Sephacryl S-200 gel filtration column chromatography to remove pre-existing nuclei. After equilibration at the desired temperature for 15 min in a thermostated cuvette chamber, actin polymerization was initiated by adding KCl and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 50 and 2 mm, respectively (27Meyer W.H. Howard T.H. Blood. 1987; 70: 363-367Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The change in light scattering was recorded as a function of time. Actin (5.0 μm) polymerized at 25 °C for 1 h was applied to carbon-coated Formvar grids and visualized following negative staining with 1.5% uranyl acetate (28Huxley H.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 281-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) using a Hitachi Model 7000 electron microscope (University of Iowa Central Electron Microscope Facility). The critical concentration was determined using light scattering as described by Chen et al. (23Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ca2+ G-actin was polymerized at room temperature for 1 h as described above. F-actin was then diluted to different concentrations in Ca2+ F-buffer (Ca2+ G-buffer + 50 mm KCl and 2 mmMgCl2) and incubated for 4 h at room temperature. The difference between the light scattering of the diluted actin and an equal amount of G-actin in G-buffer was determined. Wild-type and mutant actins were labeled with pyrene by the method of Frieden et al. (29Frieden C. Lieberman D. Gilbert H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8991-8993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as modified by Northropet al. (30Northrop J. Weber A. Mooseker M.S. Franzini-Armstrong C. Bishop M.F. Dubyak G.R. Tucker M. Walsh T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9274-9281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). G-actin in 10 mm Tris, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm ATP, pH 8.0, was mixed with pyrene maleimide at a 1.1:1.0 molar ratio with actin, and then KCl and MgCl2 were added to 100 and 2 mm, respectively. After incubation for 90 min at 20 °C in the dark, the labeled F-actin was collected by centrifugation in a TL 100.2 rotor at 75,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman TL 100 ultracentrifuge and depolymerized by dialysis against G-buffer. Extent of labeling was determined with the pyrene extinction coefficientE 344 nm = 22 mm−1cm−1. The change in pyrene fluorescence following actin polymerization was observed using either an SLM Model 4800 fluorometer or a Spex fluorolog set at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm, an emission wavelength of 386 nm, and a slit width of 1 mm. Pyrene-labeled actin (5.0 μm) was placed in a quartz cuvette at 25 °C, and polymerization was initiated by adding KCl and MgCl2 to final concentrations of 50 and 2 mm, respectively. The change in pyrene fluorescence was recorded. The emission spectra between 340 and 600 nm were obtained in a similar manner following excitation at 365 nm (14Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38PubMed Google Scholar, 15Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Excitation spectra of pyrene-labeled actin were recorded between 300 and 400 nm. The tryptophan fluorescence spectra of actin were recorded according to Lehrer et al. (31Lehrer S.S. Nagy B. Gergely J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 150: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. The quenching of tryptophan fluorescence of actin on binding Cu2+ was observed by adding an equimolar amount of CuCl2 solution (in H2O) to a cuvette containing G- or F-actin. The intrinsic ATPase activity of G-actin in either the Ca2+ or Mg2+ form was measured as described by Chen et al. (23Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Susceptibility of G-actin to digestion by α-chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin was determined according to Fievez and Carlier (32Fievez S. Carlier M.-F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thermal denaturation of G-actin was monitored by following the change in circular dichroism at 222 nm as a function of temperature according to Chen et al. (23Chen X. Cook R.K. Rubenstein P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1185-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Actin-activated S1 ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C in a buffer containing 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm imidazole HCl, pH 7.4, using the malachite green assay (33Kodama T. Fukui K. Kometani K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1986; 99: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). S1 concentration in these assays was 0.4 μm. Pyrene maleimide-labeled and unlabeled WT, S265C, and S265C/C374A actins were used at concentrations of 10 and 20 μm. Due to assay sensitivity, free phosphate was removed from actin stock solutions as described previously (34Sutoh K. Ando M. Sutoh K. Toyoshima Y.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7711-7714Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Assays of the ability of phalloidin-stabilized actin filaments to translocate over a heavy meromyosin-coated surface in the presence of ATP were performed as described previously (35Miller C.J. Wong W.W. Bobkova E. Rubenstein P.A. Reisler E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16557-16565Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) at 25 °C. The assay buffer contained 25 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EGTA, 4.0 mmMgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmimidazole, pH 7.4, 1.0 mm ATP, and glucose oxidase as an oxygen-scavenging system. Quantification of the sliding velocities was done with an Expertvision system (Motion Analysis Inc., Santa Rosa, CA). The velocities of individual filaments with standard deviations of less than one-third of the average velocity were used for statistical analysis (36Homsher E. Wang F. Sellers J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C714-C723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were considered to move smoothly in the assay system. At least 150 filaments were analyzed for each sample. The binding of S1 to pyrene-labeled WT and S265C actins was measured at 25 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5.0 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The labeled actin filaments (1.0 μm) were stabilized with phalloidin and then titrated with S1 (between 0.2 and 3.0 μm). The binding was monitored as described by Geeves and Jeffries (37Geeves M.A. Jeffries T.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 256: 41-46Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar) via quenching of pyrene fluorescence of the label attached to Cys374 in both WT and S265C actins. To assess polymerization-dependent changes in the environment of the subdomain 3/4 loop, we generated two mutant actins. In S265C actin, the conserved Ser265 was mutated to Cys to provide an attachment site on the loop for a reporter group. This actin should have potentially two accessible sulfhydryl residues, one on the loop and one on Cys374 near the C terminus. To study the loop cysteine alone, we mutated Cys374 of S265C actin to Ala and generated S265C/C374A actin. Haploid TDySC and TDySCCA cells, containing the mutant actins as the only actins in the cell, grew as well on YPD plates at 10, 30, and 37 °C as did the wild-type cells. No significant differences were found in the generation times of the S265C, S265C/C374A, and wild-type cells at the temperatures tested (data not shown). On solid hyperosmolar (0.9 m NaCl) medium, the mutant cells grew slightly faster initially than WT cells. However, in liquid hyperosmolar medium, both mutant cells grew at rates similar to that of WT cells after a 1–1.5-h lag period (data not shown). The growth of mutant and WT cells was identical at 30 °C in medium containing 2% ethylene glycol as a sole carbon source (data not shown), indicating that the inheritance of mitochondria in both S265C and S265C/C374A cells is normal. To assess the effects of the S265C mutation on actin polymerization, we monitored by light scattering the polymerization kinetics of purified, gel-filtered S265C and S265C/C374A actins. Fig.1 A shows that in the presence of 50 mm KCl and 2 mm MgCl2, mutant actins polymerized more rapidly than wild-type actin at 30 °C, but the extent of polymerization for all actins was the same. This result is consistent with the fact that the critical concentrations of mutant and WT actins were identical when determined by examining the extent of depolymerization at various concentrations of F-actin (data not shown). Although the main factor in the acceleration of polymerization of mutant actins appeared to be a shortened nucleation phase, the reason for this enhanced nucleation was not apparent. Electron microscopy of negatively stained S265C and S265C/C374A F-actins demonstrated the appearance of normal-looking filaments.Figure 3Fluorescence change in copolymers of labeled and unlabeled WT and S265C/C374A actins following polymerization.For each experiment, the total actin concentration was 5 μm.

A.U., absorbance units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The increased rate of polymerization caused by the S265C mutation might arise from a localized conformational change in the loop or from a more general conformational change affecting multiple subdomains of the monomer. However, the intrinsic ATPase activity; the susceptibility to limited proteolysis by trypsin, subtilisin, and α-chymotrypsin; and the thermal stability of S265C and S265C/C374A G-actins were essentially the same as those of WT actin. Thus, the mutations appear to cause no gross conformational change in actin structure. To further study the role of the putative hydrophobic loop in actin polymerization (5Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar), we labeled S265C and S265C/C374A actins with pyrene maleimide and studied their biochemical properties. UV absorption showed a molar labeling ratio of ∼2:1 for S265C actin and 1:1 for S265C/C374A and WT actins. C374A actin showed no labeling with coumarin maleimide and pyrene maleimide, indicating that only the sulfhydryls at positions 265 and 374, when present, were labeled (38Kim E. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1914-1919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, WT actin was labeled at Cys374 (tail-labeled), S265C actin was labeled at Cys265 and Cys374 (loop- and tail-labeled), and S265C/C374A actin was labeled only at Cys265 (loop-labeled) with pyrene maleimide. Labeling produced little change relative to WT actin in the polymerization kinetics (Fig. 1 B), extent of polymerization, filament morphology, protease susceptibility, or thermal stability of the protein. Replacement of Ca2+ with Mg2+ in the nucleotide cleft of actin or the binding of DNase I to Ca2+ G-actin had no effect on the fluorescence of labeled S265C/C374A and S265C G-actins. We next examined the fluorescence properties of the pyrene-labeled actins following their polymerization. Fig. 2 shows that as reported previously (14Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38PubMed Google Scholar), the fluorescence of WT actin starts at a very low level and increases during polymerization. Surprisingly, the fluorescence of labeled S265C/C374A G-actin was greater than that of WT actin and decreased following polymerization, suggesting that polymerization caused the probe attached to the loop to move to a more hydrophilic e"

To examine the basis of this specificity, we focused on two exposed residues in the large subunit of Rubisco that are unique to the Solanaceae proteins. By employingin vitro mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation, P89R and K356Q substitutions were separately made in theChlamydomonas enzyme to change these residues to those present in tobacco. Both mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type when grown with minimal medium in the light and contained wild-type levels of holoenzyme. Purified Rubisco was assessed for facilitated activation by spinach and tobacco activase. Both wild-type and K356Q Rubisco were similar in that spinach activase was much more effective than tobacco activase. In contrast, P89R Rubisco was not activated by spinach activase but was well activated by tobacco activase. Thus, the relative specificities of the spinach and tobacco activases for Chlamydomonas Rubisco were switched by changing a single residue at position 89.

Before catalysis, a Mg2+metal-stabilized carbamate must form on a lysine residue in the α/β barrel active site (3Lorimer G.H. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Carbamylation is spontaneous (and reversible), but it cannot occur if the active site is occupied by a sugar phosphate (4Jordan D.B. Chollet R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13752-13758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rapid increase in RuBP during the onset of illumination actually inhibits carboxylation because RuBP binds tightly to the decarbamylated form of Rubisco that predominates in darkness (4Jordan D.B.

In addition, misprotonation of RuBP can produce sugar phosphate inhibitors that bind to both decarbamylated and carbamylated sites (6Edmondson D.L. Badger M.R. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol.

Biol. 1992; 43: 415-437Crossref Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 9Salvucci M.E. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Activase couples the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the release of inhibitory sugar phosphates bound to both carbamylated and decarbamylated Rubisco active sites. High activase activity, along with high concentrations of RuBP, allows rapid and complete carbamylation to occur via a quasi-equilibrium state (10Portis Jr., A.R. Lilley R.M. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1995; 109: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Mate C.J. von Caemmerer S. Evans J.R. Hudson G.S. Andrews T.J. Planta. 1996; 198: 604-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and reverses inhibition by misprotonated sugar phosphates (12Robinson S.P. Portis Jr., A.R. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1989; 90: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Activase is essential for photosynthesis in higher plants. A mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana that lacks activase requires elevated CO2 for survival and growth (13Somerville C.R. Portis Jr., A.R. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1982; 70: 381-387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for a direct interaction between Rubisco and activase is lacking. It is known that activases from Solanaceae species (e.g. tobacco) cannot activate non-Solanaceae Rubisco (e.g. spinach) and vice versa (14Wang Z.-Y. Snyder G.W. Esau B.D. Portis Jr., A.R. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1992; 100: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because of this specificity, one might expect that primary structure comparisons would identify residues involved in the interaction between Rubisco and Rubisco activase. Whereas few protein sequences exist for activase (9Salvucci M.E. Ogren W.L. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 47: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), sequences abound for Rubisco (cf. Ref. 15Delwiche C.F. Palmer J.D. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A number of crystal structures also exist for the eukaryotic Rubisco holoenzyme (16Curmi P.M.G. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Eisenberg D. Schreuder H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16980-16989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Brändén C.-I. Eisenberg D.

Biol. 1996; 3: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By comparing primary structures of Solanaceae and non-Solanaceae Rubisco, six residues on the surface of the chloroplast-encoded large (catalytic) subunit were tentatively identified as being phylogenetically distinct (21Portis Jr., A.R. J. Exp. Bot. 1995; 46: 1285-1291Crossref Google Scholar). These residues cluster in equatorial regions between the nuclear-encoded small subunits, and several are close to the carboxyl terminus of the large subunit. The carboxyl terminus is an attractive target for Rubisco activase interaction because it and α/β barrel loop 6 close over and sequester sugar phosphate in the catalytic site (19Newman J. Gutteridge S. Structure ( Lond. ). 1994; 2: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Taylor T.C. Andersson I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because the Rubisco large subunit is coded by a chloroplast gene, it remains difficult to engineer this gene in higher plants (1Spreitzer R.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 411-434Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In contrast, directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation can be routinely applied in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (22Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because Chlamydomonas Rubisco can be activated by spinach Rubisco activase (24Roesler K.R. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1990; 94: 1837-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) but not by tobacco activase (14Wang Z.-Y. Snyder G.W. Esau B.D. Portis Jr., A.R. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1992; 100: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), two large subunit residues were separately changed to those in tobacco Rubisco (Lys-356 to Gln and Pro-89 to Arg). Species specificity of the K356Q mutant Rubisco was unchanged. However, P89R caused a reversal in Rubisco/activase specificity. The P89R mutant enzyme can no longer be activated by spinach activase, but it can now be activated by tobacco activase. Wild-type C. reinhardtii 2137 mt + (25Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rbcL nonsense mutant 18-7G mt + (26Spreitzer R.J. Ogren W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6293-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), andrbcL insertion mutant 25B1 mt + (27Newman S.M. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Johnson A.M. Boynton J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) were used as hosts for chloroplast gene transformation. The 18-7G strain contains a Trp-66 to amber (UAG) mutation within itsrbcL gene (28Spreitzer R.J. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rahiré M. Rochaix J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5460-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 25B1 strain contains a 480-base pair yeast DNA insertion at a PstI site within the 3′-region ofrbcL (27Newman S.M. Gillham N.W. Harris E.H. Johnson A.M. Boynton J.E. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1991; 230: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Each of these mutations eliminates Rubisco holoenzyme and produces a photosynthesis-deficient, acetate-requiring phenotype. All strains were maintained in darkness at 25 °C with 10 mm acetate medium containing 1.5% Bacto agar (25Spreitzer R.J. Mets L. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1981; 67: 565-569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For biochemical analysis, cells were grown on a rotary shaker with 50–500 ml of liquid acetate medium. A 2951-base pair HaeIII DNA fragment (bases −175 to 2776) containing the entire rbcL gene (bases 1–1428) (29Dron M. Rahiré M. Rochaix J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 162: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) was cloned into HincII-digested pBluescript SK− (Stratagene). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously (23Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) by employing a kit from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. (30Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). To produce the P89R mutation, therbcL gene sequence CCA (bases 265–267) was changed to CGT. This mutation abolished a BsrI site and expedited the initial screening of transformants. To create the K356Q mutation, AAA (bases 1066–1068) was changed to CAA. All mutations were confirmed by performing DNA sequencing with Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), [α-35S]dATP, and synthetic oligonucleotide primers (Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc.). The plasmids containing the P89R and K356Q rbcL mutant genes were named pLS-P89R and pLS-K356Q, respectively. The mutant rbcL plasmids were transformed into the chloroplast by employing a helium-driven device for microprojectile bombardment (31Finer J.J. Vain P. Jones M.W. McMullen M.D. Plant Cell Rep. 1992; 11: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) as described previously (22Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the phenotypes conferred by the mutantrbcL genes could not be predicted, transformants were either selected based upon photosynthetic ability in either 18-7Gmt + (for the P89R mutation) or 25B1mt + (for the K356Q mutation), or they were recovered by screening for a photosynthesis-deficient, acetate-requiring phenotype in 2137 mt + (22Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Successive rounds of single-colony isolation were performed to ensure homoplasmicity of the mutant genes (22Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Total DNA was then purified from potential transformants (32Chen Z. Yu W. Lee J.H. Diao R. Spreitzer R.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and a 1917-base pair fragment (bases −161 to 1756) containing the entire rbcL gene (bases 1–1428) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (33Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13368) Google Scholar). A Sau3A subfragment (bases −33 to 1703) containing the complete rbcL gene was cloned into pUC19 (34Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar) and transformed into Escherichia coli strain SDM (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). At least five independent E. colitransformants were screened for the mutant rbcL genes by plasmid isolation, restriction enzyme analysis, and DNA sequencing (22Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3952-3956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Zhu G. Spreitzer R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18494-18498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The expected mutations were found in all cases. A representative gene from each mutant was then sequenced in its entirety to confirm that only the intended mutation was present. The rbcL mutant strains created by directed mutagenesis and transformation were named P89R and K356Q. Total soluble cell proteins were extracted from dark-grown cells by sonication (35Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and quantified by a dye binding method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Cell extract was fractionated on sucrose gradients to quantify the amount of Rubisco holoenzyme (35Spreitzer R.J. Chastain C.J. Curr. Genet. 1987; 11: 611-616Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) by employing a 7.5–15% polyacrylamide gradient in the running gel. Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose (38Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar) by using a Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were then probed with rabbit anti-tobacco Rubisco immunoglobulin G (5 μg/ml). Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) was used as the secondary antibody, and complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.). Wild-type and mutant cells were grown in 16-liter batch cultures with acetate medium, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 160 ml of carbamylation buffer (50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA) containing 10 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine. The cells were broken with a French press, and Rubisco was differentially precipitated with 55% ammonium sulfate. The Rubisco was resuspended in 40 ml of carbamylation buffer and reprecipitated with 15% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 10,000. Rubisco was resuspended in 20 ml of carbamylation buffer and fractionated on a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column with a chloride gradient. The Rubisco fractions were concentrated and desalted by Centricon (30 kDa) ultrafiltration. The RuBP-inhibited form of Rubisco was prepared in carbamylation buffer by adding 15 mm EDTA for 15 min followed by elution through a Sephadex G25–150 desalting column equilibrated with 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA. RuBP (2 mm) was then added, and the enzyme was stored in liquid N2. Protein amount was assayed spectrophotometrically at 280 nm assuming an extinction coefficient of 1.64 absorbance units for 1 mg/ml. Leaves from spinach and tobacco plants were powdered in liquid N2, and activase was purified as described previously (14Wang Z.-Y. Snyder G.W. Esau B.D. Portis Jr., A.R. Ogren W.L. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1992; 100: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme was stored in bis-Tris, pH 7.0, and 0.2 mm ATP under liquid N2. The ability of RuBP-inhibited Rubisco to be activated by Rubisco activase was assessed by a spectrophotometric assay at 25 °C that couples the product of RuBP carboxylation, 3-phosphoglycerate, to the oxidation of NADH (10Portis Jr., A.R. Lilley R.M. Andrews T.J. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1995; 109: 1441-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 39Lan Y. Mott K.A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1991; 95: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tricine, pH 8.0, 12 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm RuBP, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 750 μm NADH, and coupling enzymes (60 IU/ml 3-phosphoglycerate kinase, 300 IU/ml triose-phosphate isomerase, and 30 IU/ml each of creatine phosphokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and carbonic anhydrase). Activase was added to the reaction mixture 2 min before initiating the reactions with 50 μg/ml RuBP-inhibited Rubisco. The average absorbance of NADH (370–380 nm) was monitored with an HP 8452A (Hewlett-Packard Co.) diode array spectrophotometer, and data were analyzed by moving linear regressions of 1-min duration. Observed increases in the rates of carboxylation are ascribed to an increase in the extent of activation (39Lan Y. Mott K.A. Plant Physiol. ( Rockv. ). 1991; 95: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Maximal rates of carboxylation were measured with fully activated Rubisco (no preincubation with RuBP). Carbamylation rates were calculated by dividing the observed carboxylation rate by the maximal carboxylation rate and adjusted to a site ratio assuming 1 mg of Rubisco contains 14.28 nmol of active sites (4Jordan D.B. Chollet R. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13752-13758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sequences of Rubisco large subunits from three non-Solanaceae (spinach, pea, Chlamydomonas) and three Solanaceae (tobacco, petunia, tomato) species were compared. Any residue that was identical in the sequences of one or more members of both groups was not considered further. The resulting list of 12 residues (Fig. 1) was reduced to 7 by eliminating replacements that were apparently conservative (residues 19, 353, and 443) and residues that did not exist in the shorter non-Solanaceae large subunit (residues 476 and 477). As shown in Fig. 1, three residues (89, 356, and 468) displayed a clear and consistent distinction between Solanaceae and non-Solanaceae large subunit sequences. We decided to focus on those two residues that are farthest from the carboxyl terminus (residues 89 and 356). By employing directed mutagenesis and chloroplast transformation, each of these twoChlamydomonas residues was changed to the corresponding residue commonly found in Solanaceae Rubisco. To reduce the chance of recombination with wild-type sequence regions, mutant P89R was recovered by transforming the 18-7G rbcL nonsense mutant, and mutant K356Q was recovered by transforming the 25B1 rbcL insertion mutant. In both cases, transformants were recovered by selecting for photosynthetic ability on minimal medium in the light. Thus, it was readily apparent that the mutant Rubisco enzymes must maintain a substantial level of activity in vivo. Both mutants are indistinguishable from wild type when grown with minimal medium in the light, and both were found to have wild-type levels of Rubisco holoenzyme when cell extracts were fractionated on sucrose gradients (data not shown). Western analysis confirmed the normal levels of Rubisco in both mutants (Fig. 2) but also revealed that the P89R large subunit has increased mobility on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Fig. 2, lane 2). Considering that normal levels of holoenzyme are present, it seems likely that this apparent molecular weight alteration arises from a difference in the way that SDS binds to P89R Rubisco. A change of proline to a positively charged arginine might also change the structure of the SDS-protein complex and increase its mobility within the gel matrix (40Mattice W.L. Riser J.M. Clark D.S. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4264-4272Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the apparent size difference for the P89R protein was inherited in a uniparental pattern (data not shown), indicating that it arises from the mutation in the P89R rbcL gene. Furthermore, extensive DNA sequencing identified only the expected mutation in this gene.Figure 2Western analysis of total soluble proteins from wild type, mutant P89R, and mutant K356Q. Cells were grown in acetate medium in the dark before extraction. Each lane of an SDS-polyacrylamide gel received 50 μg of protein. After electrophoresis, the gel was blotted to nitrocellulose and probed with rabbit anti-tobacco Rubisco immunoglobulin G. Lane 1, wild type; lane 2, mutant P89R; lane 3, mutant K356Q. The large subunit (LS) and small subunit (SS) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Large scale preparations of Rubisco were obtained from wild type and both mutants. Preliminary studies indicated that the mutant enzymes had wild-type carboxylase activities. The purified, non-carbamylated Rubisco enzymes were then inhibited by RuBP and assessed for facilitated activation by spinach and tobacco activases (Fig. 3). Both wild-type and K356Q Rubisco were similar in that spinach activase was much more effective than tobacco activase. In contrast, P89R Rubisco was little affected by spinach activase but was well activated by tobacco activase (Fig.3). The response of the three Rubisco enzymes to increases in activase concentration was linear over the range examined (Fig.4) and allowed a determination of the relative specific carbamylation rates. With spinach activase, the specific carbamylation rate with wild-type enzyme was 1.22 nmol of CO2/nmol site·min·mg of activase, whereas activation of the K356Q enzyme had a somewhat lower value of 0.83. Most significantly, the P89R mutant was unresponsive to spinach activase (Fig. 4). The pattern shifted when tobacco activase was used. Both the wild-type and K356Q enzymes were activated at a low rate (0.21 nmol of CO2/nmol site-min-mg of activase, but the P89R enzyme was activated at a higher rate (0.72 nmol of CO2/nmol site-min-mg of activase). We have demonstrated that the relative specificities of the spinach and tobacco activases for Chlamydomonas Rubisco can be switched by changing a single residue, Pro-89 to Arg. This result also provides evidence for a site on the Rubisco holoenzyme that interacts directly with Rubisco activase. In the absence of an activase crystal structure, the molecular basis for the activase specificity reversal caused by the P89R large subunit mutation is difficult to discern. However, it is possible to compare the x-ray structures of tobacco and spinach Rubisco (17Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Brändén C.-I. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1136-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the latter of which may be more like Chlamydomonas Rubisco (Fig. 1). A comparison of the surface residues identified in Fig. 1 is presented in Fig. 5. There are four structural features of interest in this region (Fig. 5): a hypervariable region from residue 86 through 95 that includes the critical residue 89 identified in this study; the residues 356–360 associated with residue 356; the carboxyl-terminal residues 466–475/477; and the flexible loop 6 region (residues 331–340), which contains the Lys-334 that interacts directly with the “buried” sugar phosphate (19Newman J. Gutteridge S. Structure ( Lond. ). 1994; 2: 495-502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Taylor T.C. Andersson I. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Replacement of Pro-89 with Arg introduces a much larger, positively charged side chain (Fig. 5) that could potentially interfere with the ability of spinach activase to interact with P89RChlamydomonas Rubisco (Figs. 3 and 4). The ability of tobacco activase to activate the P89R enzyme, but not the wild-type enzyme (Figs. 3 and 4), indicates that Arg-89 is not only accommodated by tobacco activase, but that this residue is critical for a sufficient interaction to occur. Another major difference between tobacco, spinach, and Chlamydomonas Rubisco occurs at nearby residue 86 (Fig. 5). Tobacco Rubisco contains Arg-86, whereas the spinach andChlamydomonas enzymes contain His and Asp, respectively (Fig. 1). Perhaps a D86R substitution in the Chlamydomonasenzyme in addition to P89R would further improve the ability of tobacco activase to activate Chlamydomonas Rubisco. The other major difference in this region is a change from Glu-94 and Asn-95 in spinach Rubisco (Asp-94 and Asn-95 in Chlamydomonas Rubisco) to Lys-94 and Asp-95 in tobacco Rubisco (Fig. 1). Glu-94 is solvent-accessible in the spinach structure, whereas Lys-94 in tobacco Rubisco points in the opposite direction and interacts with Glu-93 and Gln-96 (Fig. 5). Both Asn-95 (spinach) and Asp-95 (tobacco) interact with Trp-97. If the negative charge of Rubisco residue 94 is important for an interaction with spinach and Chlamydomonas activase, perhaps a similar interaction occurs with Asp-95 in tobacco Rubisco by reorientation of the residue upon activase binding. The effect of amino acid substitutions at these residues in the Chlamydomonasenzyme may answer this question. Replacement of Lys-356 with Gln had little effect on the ability ofChlamydomonas Rubisco to be activated by spinach activase and did not enable activation by tobacco activase (Figs. 3 and 4). Thus, the difference at this residue in the spinach and tobacco Rubisco enzymes (Figs. 1 and 5) does not appear to play a role in activase specificity. Perhaps the creation of a less conservative substitution would be necessary to determine whether this region is involved in activase recognition. The close proximity of residue 89 to the carboxyl terminus and loop 6 (Fig. 5), both flexible elements that close off the active site during tight binding of various sugar bisphosphates (16Curmi P.M.G. Cascio D. Sweet R.M. Eisenberg D. Schreuder H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16980-16989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schreuder H.A. Knight S. Curmi P.M.G. Andersson I. Cascio D.

Biol. 1996; 3: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), prompts future consideration of these areas in molecular mechanisms for the influence of activase on sugar phosphate binding in the Rubisco active site. Whereas the ability of tobacco activase to activate the P89RChlamydomonas enzyme indicates that other structural regions are not critical for determining activase specificity, this result does not eliminate the possibility that other structural interactions are necessary for Rubisco activation. To investigate the possible roles of the Rubisco carboxyl-terminal and loop 6 regions in activation will require the creation and study of amino acid substitutions, specifically in these regions. The loop 6 residues that are clearly solvent-accessible (Glu-338, Arg-339, and Asp-340) (Fig. 5) may interact with activase, thereby providing a means for the release of sugar phosphate from its interaction with loop 6 Lys-334 (16Curmi P.M.G.

Although we have not yet been able to adequately purifyChlamydomonas activase for in vitro studies, it seems likely that the mutant Rubisco can still be sufficiently activated by Chlamydomonas activase. Nonetheless, as additional large subunit substitutions are generated, we anticipate that photosynthesis-deficient strains will be recovered in which the interaction between Rubisco and Rubisco activase is eliminated. Mutants of this type might then allow compensatory substitutions in Rubisco activase to be recovered via genetic selection and studied (32Chen Z. Yu W. Lee J.H. Diao R. Spreitzer R.J.

To this end, we applied a glutathione S-transferase-pulldown assay to extracts from Sf9 insect cells, which were coinfected with all possible combinations of recombinant baculoviruses expressing hRPB subunits, either as untagged polypeptides or as glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins. This is the first comprehensive study of interactions between eukaryotic RNA polymerase subunits; among the 116 combinations of hRPB subunits tested, 56 showed significant to strong interactions, whereas 60 were negative. Within the intricate network of interactions, subunits hRPB3 and hRPB5 play a central role in polymerase organization. These subunits, which are able to homodimerize and to interact, may constitute the nucleation center for polymerase assembly, by providing a large interface to most of the other subunits.

The initiation process involves the formation of a multi-protein complex, referred to as the preinitiation complex (PIC), on the template DNA. The PIC may be assembled stepwise on the promoter by sequential binding of RPB and general transcription factors (3Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D.

Recent observations also suggest that formation of the PIC may result from the direct promoter association of a large preformed complex (referred to as the holoenzyme) comprising, in addition to the above mentioned components, several polypeptides, some of which are involved in the chromatin clearing of the target promoter region (5Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The description, at the molecular level, of the spatial organization of this complex edifice necessitates a detailed knowledge of the structure of its central component, RPB. Depending on its origin, RPB consists of 10–14 polypeptides ranging from 220 to 10 kDa (6Sentenac A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 18: 31-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 7Young R.A.

Electron microscopy image processing and two-dimensional crystal analyses have been applied to yeast RNA polymerase I (RPA) and RPB (9Schultz P. Celia H. Riva M. Darst S.A. Colin P. Kornberg R.D.

Cell. 1991; 66: 121-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and have suggested a rather complex structure. Several subunit-specific epitopes have recently been localized within the yeast RPA, using immunoelectron microscopy (11Klinger C. Huet J. Song D.Y. Petersen G. Riva M. Bautz E.K.F. Sentenac A. Oudet P. Schultz P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4643-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Potential interactions between the various subunits of yeast RNA polymerase III (RPC) have been tested by the two-hybrid system. However, few contacts could be detected by this method and comprised only RPC-specific subunits (12Lalo D. Carles C. Sentenac A. Thuriaux P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5524-5528Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Functional domains could be assigned to specific subunits, on the basis of primary sequence conservations between subunits of DNA-dependent RNA polymerases from all living organisms and experimental approaches such as affinity labeling, protein and DNA blotting, cross-linking, protease-susceptibility measurements, and functional inhibition by subunit-specific antibodies (11Klinger C. Huet J. Song D.Y. Petersen G. Riva M. Bautz E.K.F. Sentenac A. Oudet P. Schultz P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4643-4653Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Both largest subunits (so-called β′ and β-like subunits, respectively) have been found to interact with the DNA template and RNA, while only the second largest binds the initiator nucleotide. Together, these observations strongly suggest that these large subunits contain most of the catalytic activities. On the other hand, the phenotypes associated with the deletion of six yeast subunit genes could be independently compensated for, at least to some extent, by their human counterparts (13Shpakovski G.V.

These results further emphasize the role of conserved sequence elements, but also indicate that the polymerases can accommodate, at least to some extent, variations in primary structure between subunits. In the present study, we have undertaken a systematic analysis of the interactions that may exist between the various hRPB subunits. Using a baculovirus expression system, we were able to overexpress all the hRPB subunits (except hRPB4, which was originally not available) in a soluble form, either as untagged subunits or as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusions. The interactions between pairs of subunits were then tested in a GST-pulldown assay for the available subunits. While not all subunits interact under these conditions, the results reveal a number of reciprocal bindings whose relevance is discussed in the context of the complete enzyme. Detailed knowledge of the interaction network between the subunits will ultimately help in generating functional complexes from recombinant polypeptides. For the sake of simplicity, the subunits of hRPB (initially based on their molecular mass in kDa) have been renamed, following the genetic nomenclature of yeast RPB subunits (7Young R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 689-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar,17Treich I. Carles C. Riva M. Sentenac A. Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 31-37PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, each hRPB subunit was attributed a number (n = 1–9, 10α, 10β, and 11), as indicated in TableI. Cloning of sequences encoding hRPB1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10α, and 10β subunits has been described previously (in Refs.18Wintzerith M. Acker J. Vicaire S. Vigneron M. Kedinger C.

Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4702-4710Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, respectively). Recently, the sequence of a subunit named hRPB14 was described (24Pati U.K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 145: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our attempts to reclone this cDNA from our HeLa cell cDNA library failed. Instead, upon screening data bases with the hRPB14 sequence, we identified a human expressed sequence tag (EST) (HUMGS00602; GenBank™ accession no. D19649) exhibiting a strong homology with the 5′, but not the 3′ portion of hRPB14. Using primers derived from the 3′ portion of the EST sequence and from the 5′ portion of the hRPB14 sequence, we PCR-amplified a fragment of the expected size (420 bp) from our HeLa cDNA library. The resulting fragment was cloned and its sequence established (accession no. X98433). This cDNA, which represents the major detectable species in our library, will be referred to henceforth as hRPB11. Independently, a human cDNA was recently published (25Fanciulli M. Bruno T. Cerboni C. Bonetto F. Iacobini C. Frati L. Piccoli M. Floridi A. Santoni A. Punturieri A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (accession no. L37127), which encodes a polypeptide identical to hRPB11. The original hRPB14 (24Pati U.K. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 145: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) may therefore represent either a rare related protein or a cloning artifact consisting of a chimeric cDNA. PCR-mediated mutagenesis was used to insert unique restriction sites (NheI, SpeI, orXbaI, depending on the target cDNA) at the boundaries of each hRPB open reading frame. These sites have been chosen because they generate cleavage products which are compatible with NheI,SpeI, XbaI, and AvrII sites, and may be inserted into any one of them. The DNA fragments containing the open reading frames of all subunits except hRPB1 and hRPB2 were inserted into the XbaI site of the pVL1393 baculovirus transfer vector (PharMingen) (Fig.1, left). The hRPB1 and hRPB2 sequences were subcloned together into the XbaI and SpeI cloning sites of the pAcAB4 transfer vector (PharMingen), respectively. The hRPB1 NheI fragment lacking its proper termination codon was inserted, after filling-in of the ends, into the repairedXbaI site, creating an artificial stop codon (underlined) at the resulting junction: 5′-GCT AGC TAG A-3′. The corresponding hRPB1 peptide consisted of 1972 amino acids including the C-terminal extra Ala-Ser residues. The XbaI fragment spanning the hRPB2 coding sequence was inserted into theSpeI cloning site of the same vector. The resulting plasmid enabled the creation of a baculovirus that simultaneously expressed hRPB1 and hRPB2 (Fig. 1, middle). In another series of constructions, the pVL1393 vector was modified by insertion of an EcoRI fragment spanning the GST coding sequence (excised from the pGEX-3X plasmid; Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) into the unique EcoRI site of pVL1393. In addition, the polylinker was altered so as to include unique NheI andNdeI cloning sites that allowed insertion of the subunit sequences and subsequent expression of the corresponding GST fusion proteins, with the GST at the N-terminal position (Fig. 1,right). In the case of the GST-hRPB1 construct, six His residues were added to the natural hRPB1 before reaching a translation termination site. In all other cases, translation terminated at the natural position. The resulting transfer vectors were then recombined with linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold DNA, PharMingen) in Sf9 cells, using procedures recommended by the manufacturer. The Sf9 cells were grown in the TNM-FH medium as described (26Grace T.C.D. Nature. 1962; 195: 788-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) at 28 °C. The recombinant viruses were plaque-purified, and correct expression of the corresponding hRPB subunits was verified by Western blot analysis. Viral stocks were prepared by a three-step growth amplification. About 2 × 105 Sf9 cells, grown in 24-well dishes (Falcon), were coinfected with pairs of the appropriate baculoviruses. Multiplicities of infection (between 2 and 10 plaque-forming units/cell) were adjusted, so as to balance the amount of recombinant proteins simultaneously expressed from each virus. At 44 h postinfection, the medium was replaced by a Met- or Met/Cys-free medium and35S-labeled Met (hRPB1, 2, 6, 7, and 8) or a mixture of Met and Cys (hRPB5, 9, 10α, 10β, and 11) (25 μCi each in 500 μl of medium) were added. The cells were collected 4 h later and disrupted by three cycles of freeze-thawing in 500 μl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 2.5 ng/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, antipain, and chymostatin (Sigma). The cell lysate was centrifuged (10 min at 14,000 × g), and the cleared supernatant was used for labeled protein analysis. The 35S-labeled cell extracts (400 μl) were first incubated with 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) to adsorb nonspecific binding proteins. The treated extracts were then incubated with 15 μl of glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) that were preblocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin. After 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed with buffer A. The final concentrations of salt and detergent were adjusted to minimize nonspecific interactions; NaCl was 300 (hRPB9), 500 (hRPB1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 10α, 10β, and 11) or 1000 mm (hRPB5), and Nonidet P-40 was 0.1 (hRPB9) or 1% (all the other subunits). After washing, the beads were boiled in the electrophoresis sample buffer (20 μl) and the retained proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206620) Google Scholar). After soaking the gel in a 10% solution of diphenyloxazole in acetic acid, the labeled proteins were revealed by autoradiography. A monoclonal antibody (anti-hRPB6) against the purified bacterially synthesized recombinant hRPB6 subunit was produced, as described previously for the anti-hRPB5 antibody (28Nguyen V.T. Giannoni F. Dubois M.F. Seo S.J. Vigneron M. Kedinger C. Bensaude O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2924-2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against hRPB3 were raised in rabbits by injecting a mixture of ovalbumin-coupled synthetic peptides spanning residues 131–141 and 207–217. Proteins that were separated by SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters were reacted with specific antibodies and revealed by a chemiluminescence detection system (NEN Life Science Products), as described (29Bocco J.L. Reimund B. Chatton B. Kedinger C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2977-2986PubMed Google Scholar). The capacity of two proteins to interact with each other may be examined by a number of different techniques, including the yeast two-hybrid system (30Luban J. Goff S.P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the co-immunoprecipitation test (31Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), far Western detection (31Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or the GST-pulldown assay (32Chatton B. Bahr A. Acker J. Kedinger C. Biotechniques. 1995; 18: 142-145PubMed Google Scholar). The two-hybrid assay has been quite informative in many instances, but, for reasons that are not clear, did not give satisfactory results in the present case; no positive results were obtained, even with combinations of recombinant hRPB subunits that, according to genetic evidence in yeast, were expected to interact. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have also been used with success to identify interacting protein(s) with the help of antibodies directed against one of the partners (31Phizicky E.M. Fields S. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 94-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, an extensive study would require a complete set of antibodies capable of precipitating each hRPB subunit. Furthermore, some antibodies may destabilize or even disrupt the interaction that one is looking for, especially in the case of the smallest subunits. Far Western assays, which involve the probing of a protein blot with a protein of interest, are critically dependent on the efficiency of SDS removal and protein renaturation after SDS-PAGE; less stable interactions may be missed in such a system. For these reasons, we used the GST-pulldown assay in which any interacting subunit would be retained on GSH-agarose beads, together with the GST-tagged partner subunit. We first tried to overexpress each of these subunits, as untagged polypeptides or GST fusions, in bacterial isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression vectors. However, most of the proteins were either produced as insoluble inclusion bodies or found partially degraded in the bacterial extracts (data not shown). Therefore, we opted for the baculovirus expression system; each hRPB cDNA, with the exception of hRPB4, was cloned into appropriate recombinogenic vectors (under the control of the baculovirus P10 or polyhedrin promoter) and introduced into the baculovirus genome by in vivo recombination. The resulting viruses, upon infection of Sf9 insect cells, allowed efficient synthesis of all subunits, whether free or fused to GST, as both soluble and intact proteins. The only subunit that remained poorly soluble and accumulated in reduced amounts was hRPB2, despite care being taken to coexpress it with hRPB1 (or hRPB3; data not shown), from the same vector. Coexpression was indeed found to improve the yields of proteins otherwise weakly soluble. 2J. Acker, C. Kedinger, and M. Vigneron, unpublished observation. The baculovirus expression system had the additional advantage of providing an eukaryotic environment for protein synthesis and assembly, as opposed to bacterial or in vitro systems. To facilitate detection of the virally expressed proteins, the infected cells were radiolabeled by growing them in the presence of35S-labeled methionine or methionine/cysteine, at a late time (44 h) postinfection. Since only a limited number of viral or cellular proteins continue to be synthesized at this period after infection, the labeling pattern is reasonably clean and allows easy visualization of the extraneous polypeptides. Efficient incorporation occurred in all recombinant subunits, allowing their easy identification by SDS-PAGE analysis of a crude infected Sf9 cell extract, even in the case of hRPB11, which contains only one of each of these residues. The overall content of each subunit in Met and Cys residues, whether fused to GST or not (Table II), was taken into account for a rough estimation of the relative amounts of proteins visualized. Sf9 cells were coinfected with pairs of baculovirus recombinants expressing the various RPB polypeptides, one as a GST fusion and the other as an untagged protein. Potential interactions between each combination of tested subunits were scored by the coretention of the untagged subunit onto the GSH-agarose beads, as revealed by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). In case of ambiguous identification of a particular band, due to overlapping electrophoretic mobilities of the tagged and untagged molecules, the proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with specific antibodies (Fig. 2,B and D, and data not shown). The strength of the interactions between the subunits was deduced from the relative intensities of the bands corresponding to the GST-fused subunits and their non-fused counterparts (see legend to TableIII).Table IIISummary of the hRPB interactions as detected by the GST-pulldown assayhRPBGST-hRPB1235678910α10β111NDND++−−+++−++−2NDND++−−+−++−3++++++++++++++++++−+++++++++5+++++++++++++++−++++−6+−++−−+−−+−−7+++−+++++−+++−++−8++++++−++−+++−9−−−−−−−−−−−10α−ND+++−−−−−+−−10β++++++++++−−−−−−−11−−+++−−−−−+−−The strengths of interactions between pairs of hRPB subunits (non-fused and GST-fused) were deduced from sets of experiments including and similar to those shown in Fig. 2.

ND, not determined. Each of the GST-hRPB fusion protein was coexpressed pairwise with every available non-fused hRPB subunit, using this baculovirus system. This allowed the examination of the reciprocal interactions between any tagged subunit with any non-tagged one and thereby allowed us to take into account possible influences of the GST tag on subunit interactions. The results of GST-pulldown experiments such as those shown in Fig. 2 and others (data not shown) are summarized in TableIII. In each series of GST-pulldown experiments, the specificity of the binding reactions was systematically controlled by coexpressing the non-fused GST protein and verifying the lack of interaction with any of the hRPB proteins. In cases where some nonspecific interaction was detected with the GST protein alone (as in Fig. 2 A, for example), the amount of nonspecifically bound protein was subtracted from the GST-hRPB-pulldown quantitations. Three hRPB subunits were repeatedly found in this assay to interact with themselves (hRPB3, hRPB5, and hRPB7), suggesting that they may be present at two (or more) copies within the whole enzyme molecule. Strikingly, together hRPB3 and hRPB5 were able to contact all of the other hRPB subunits, with perhaps the only exception being hRPB9. We did not analyze separately the interaction pattern of the non-fused hRPB1 and hRPB2 subunits with the GST fusions. To improve the solubility of the untagged hRPB2 subunit, it was coexpressed with hRPB1, from the same recombinant baculovirus. The behavior of both proteins together was examined in the GST-pulldown assay (Fig.2 A). Because of the likelihood of direct interactions between these two large subunits, unambiguous interpretation of the observed results was difficult. However, combining them with those obtained with the GST-hRPB1 and hRPB2 fusion proteins (panels B–I), suggested that both hRPB1 and hRPB2 efficiently interact with hRPB3, whereas only hRPB1 strongly binds to hRPB5. This conclusion was further corroborated by immunoprecipitation experiments in which antibodies against hRPB1 effectively coprecipitated hRPB3 or hRPB5, from extracts of cells coinfected with the corresponding recombinant baculoviruses (data not shown).

Whether cholesterol can move directly from lysosomes to ER or first must traverse the plasma membrane has not been established. To examine this question, the endocytic pathway of rat hepatoma cells was loaded at 18 °C with low density lipoproteins (LDL) labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate, and the label then was chased at 37 °C. The hydrolysis of the accumulated ester proceeded linearly for several hours. Almost all of the released [3H]cholesterol moved to the plasma membrane rapidly and without a discernable lag. In contrast, the re-esterification in the ER of the released [3H]cholesterol showed a characteristic lag of 0.5–1 h. These data are inconsistent with direct cholesterol transfer from lysosomes to ER; rather, they suggest movement through the plasma membrane.Furthermore, we found that progesterone, imipramine and 3-β-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one (U18666A) strongly inhibited the re-esterification of lysosomal cholesterol in the ER. However, contrary to previous reports, they did not block transfer of [3H]cholesterol from lysosomes to the cell surface. Therefore, the site of action of these agents was not at the lysosomes. We suggest instead that their known ability to block cholesterol movement from the plasma membrane to the ER accounts for the inhibition of lysosomal cholesterol esterification.These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that cholesterol released from lysosomes passes through the plasma membrane on its way to the ER rather than proceeding there directly.

As a result, ingested cholesterol is subject to the same homeostatic regulation as the bulk of cell cholesterol, which is located in the plasma membrane. Cell cholesterol levels are tightly regulated by homeostatic mechanisms. For example, when cells ingest cholesterol in the form of low density lipoprotein (LDL), 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LPDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum; [3H]LDL, [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL; U18666A, 3-β-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; ACAT, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; LPDS, lipoprotein-deficient serum; [3H]LDL, [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL; U18666A, 3-β-[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]androst-5-en-17-one; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. sterol biosynthesis is reduced and excess cholesterol is converted to cholesteryl esters for storage (1Brown M.S.

Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1985: 404-474Google Scholar). While these processes are well understood, the associated pathways of intracellular cholesterol movement are obscure. It appears that cholesterol moves bidirectionally between the plasma membrane and the ER (3Lange Y. Echevarria F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cholesterol released from ingested LDL in lysosomes moves rapidly to the plasma membrane (4Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 103-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the cholesterol derived from the degradation of LDL is re-esterified by ACAT (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4331) Google Scholar, 2Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. Biochemistry of Lipids and Membranes. Benjamin/Cummings, Menlo Park, CA1985: 404-474Google Scholar), lysosomal sterol must also be transported to the ER. Two recent studies addressed the question of the pathway taken by cholesterol from lysosomes to ER. One suggested direct movement of cholesterol from lysosomes to ER by a mechanism that is inhibited by amphiphiles (5Underwood K.W. Andemariam B. McWilliams G.L. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1556-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The other concluded that approximately 70% of lysosomal cholesterol passes through the plasma membrane prior to esterification, the remainder moving directly between the lysosomes and the ER (6Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the fate of ingested LDL [3H]cholesteryl esters. We found no evidence for a pathway of cholesterol movement from the lysosomes to the ER that does not include the plasma membrane. [1a-2a(n)-(3H)]cholesteryl linoleate (48 Ci/mmol), [1,2-3H]cholesterol (40 Ci/mmol), [4-14C]cholesterol (52 mCi/mmol), and [1-14C]oleic acid (58 mC/mmol) were from Amersham Corp. Cholesterol oxidase (EC 1.1.3.6; Brevibacterium sp.) was from Beckman Clinical Diagnostics (Carlsbad, CA). U18666A was from The Upjohn Co. (Kalamazoo, MI). FU5AH rat hepatoma cells and human foreskin fibroblasts derived from primary explants were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to feeding labeled LDL, fibroblasts were incubated for 16–20 h in medium supplemented with 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum to up-regulate LDL receptors (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (4331) Google Scholar). Such preincubation did not substantially stimulate LDL uptake in hepatoma cells (data not shown) and was omitted in experiments with these cells. Similar results were obtained with both cells types. However, because they esterify large amounts of cholesterol, hepatoma cells were used in these studies with the exception of the subcellular fractionation of cell homogenates on Percoll gradients where resolution of membranes was much better for fibroblasts. Plasma obtained from healthy volunteers was labeled with [3H]cholesteryl linoleate as described (7Axelson M. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15102-15110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the LDL was isolated by ultracentrifugation (8Goldstein J.L. Basu S.K. Brown M.S. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 98: 241-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). The product had a specific activity of ∼106 dpm/mg protein. Lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) was prepared from fetal bovine serum as described (9Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7306-7314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were rinsed and covered with phosphate-buffered saline plus the radiolabeled cholesterol solubilized in Triton WR1339 (0.025% final). The flasks were incubated for 20 min at 18 °C, the buffer was removed, and the cells were rinsed and layered with medium for further incubation at 37 °C as described in the figure legends. The medium was removed from replicate flasks of cells, and the cells were rinsed. Medium containing 5% LPDS plus [3H]LDL (50 μg/ml protein) was layered over the cells, and the flasks were incubated for 1.5–2 h at 18 °C (10Johnson W.J. Chacko G.K. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled medium was removed, and the cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Medium containing 10% fetal calf serum or 5% LPDS was then added to the flasks for further incubation at 37 °C. Cell homogenates prepared as described (11Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were mixed with 30% Percoll in 5 mmNaPi (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mmEDTA and layered on a 0.2-ml cushion of 56% sucrose in 5 mm NaPi (pH 7.5). The tubes were centrifuged for 30 min at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor. The gradients were fractionated from the bottom of the tubes. Cells were dissociated and fixed for 10 min on ice with 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. They were washed twice in 5 mm NaPi (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose and resuspended in 0.1 mmEDTA (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose. After warming for 5 min at 37 °C, cholesterol oxidase was added at 10 IU/ml, and the cells were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C prior to extraction and assay. For measurement of incorporation of [3H]cholesterol into total esters, cholesterol and cholestenone, the extracted lipids were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on silica gel G plates using hexane:ethyl acetate (90:10) as solvent. The plates were developed in iodine, and the spots corresponding to authentic standards were scraped into vials for the determination of radioactivity. The re-esterification in the ER of [3H]cholesterol released from [3H]cholesteryl linoleate in the lysosomes was determined by its appearance in the palmitate plus oleate forms. [3H]cholesteryl esters were measured by HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column at 30 °C using acetonitrile:isopropyl alcohol (1:1) as the mobile phase (12Sarria A.J. Panini S.R. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19455-19463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Re-esterification of [3H]cholesterol was calculated as: ([3H]cholesteryl oleate + [3H]cholesteryl palmitate) divided by ([3H]cholesterol + [3H]cholesteryl oleate + [3H]cholesteryl palmitate). Hydrolysis of [3H]LDL was calculated as: ([3H]cholesterol + [3H]cholesteryl oleate + [3H]cholesteryl palmitate) divided by ([3H]cholesteryl linoleate + [3H]cholesterol + [3H]cholesteryl oleate + [3H]cholesteryl palmitate). Results from time courses using replicate flasks were normalized to total input radioactivity. In some experiments, [3H] values were corrected for losses using [14C]cholesteryl oleate added at the moment of extraction. Cholesterol mass was determined by HPLC (3Lange Y. Echevarria F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21439-21443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay used 0.8 mg/ml 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-galactopyranoside (Molecular Probes) as substrate. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C in 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 3.0) containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and stopped by adding 4 volumes of 200 mmsodium phosphate (pH 12). A pulse of [3H]cholesteryl linoleate-labeled LDL ([3H]LDL) was allowed to accumulate in pre-lyosomal compartments during a preincubation at 18 °C (10Johnson W.J. Chacko G.K. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5546-5553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There was little hydrolysis of the [3H]cholesteryl linoleate during the loading period (Figs. 1 Aand 2 A). Shift to 37 °C evoked rapid hydrolysis. The arrival of the released [3H]cholesterol at the ER was scored by its appearance in cholesteryl oleate and cholesteryl palmitate. The free [3H]cholesterol was re-esterified with lagged kinetics (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Time course of incorporation into cholesteryl esters of [14C]oleic acid and [3H]cholesterol released from LDL in hepatoma cells.Replicate flasks of cells were labeled with [3H]LDL as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The cells were rinsed, and fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum plus 0.07 μCi/ml [14C]oleic was added to the flasks. At the times indicated, the cells were dissociated and assayed for free [3H]cholesterol and for the incorporation of3H and 14C into newly synthesized esters as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A shows the hydrolysis of LDL [3H]cholesteryl linoleate calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 1 A.Panel B shows the incorporation of [3H]cholesterol into [3H]cholesteryl oleate and palmitate expressed as a percentage of total [3H]cholesterol (•), and the incorporation into esters of [14C]oleic acid (○) given as total dpm/flask.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the experiment shown in Fig. 1, ∼87% of the small amount of free [3H]cholesterol released from LDL in the lysosomes was accessible to cholesterol oxidase after the 2-h incubation at 18 °C (Fig. 1 C). Approximately the same fraction of total free cholesterol was in the oxidizable pool at each time point during the subsequent 37 °C chase. This finding confirms that lysosomal cholesterol moves rapidly and continuously to the plasma membrane (4Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 103-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data also demonstrate that almost all of the free cholesterol released from LDL accumulates in the plasma membrane. The esterification of bulk cell cholesterol in intact cells is commonly measured by the incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesteryl esters (13Suckling K.E. Stange E.F. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 647-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We compared the kinetics of bulk cholesterol esterification with that of the re-esterification of lysosomal [3H]cholesterol (Fig. 2). Incorporation of [14C]oleate into cholesteryl esters proceeded linearly while the esterification of the [3H]cholesterol from lysosomes once again was lagged. These data suggest that the lag in re-esterification of LDL cholesterol reflected the kinetics of its delivery to ACAT rather than the activity of the enzyme. We prelabeled the lysosomal pool with ingested LDL [3H]cholesteryl linoleate and the plasma membrane pool with [14C]cholesterol. At intervals thereafter, 3H and 14C were determined in free and (re-)esterified cholesterol. The re-esterification of ingested LDL [3H]cholesterol was again strongly lagged while the esterification of plasma membrane [14C]cholesterol had only a small lag, perhaps reflecting recovery from the 18 °C incubation (Fig. 3 A). With increasing time of chase, the fraction of each label esterified approached the same value (Fig. 3 B). A variety of amphiphiles inhibit cholesterol esterification, apparently by blocking movement of plasma membrane cholesterol to the ER (14Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29371-29374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3411-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Debry P. Nash E.A.

Nash E.A. Neklason D.W. Metherall J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1026-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although there is evidence that progesterone inhibits the transport of nascent cholesterol to caveolae (17Smart E.J. Ying Y. Donzell W.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29427-29435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar), other studies have shown that the amphiphiles have no effect on sterol movement from the ER to the plasma membrane (14Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29371-29374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Metherall J.E. Waugh K. Li H. J. Biol.

We now have tested their effect on transfer of [3H]cholesterol from lysosomes to the plasma membrane and ER. None of the amphipaths tested had a significant impact on either the hydrolysis of the labeled LDL esters or on the movement of the liberated [3H]cholesterol to the cholesterol oxidase-sensitive compartment (the plasma membrane) (Fig.4). In some experiments (e.g. Fig. 6), and at higher concentrations, imipramine and U18666A inhibited the hydrolysis of [3H]LDL, perhaps by reducing lysosomal acidity (19Liscum L. Underwood K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15443-15446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, in no case did the agents affect the rate of appearance of [3H]cholesterol in the oxidizable pool.Figure 6Effect of progesterone, imipramine, and U18666A on re-esterification of lysosomal cholesterol in hepatoma cells. Replicate flasks of cells were incubated in medium containing 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum and [3H]LDL for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of progesterone (12 μm), imipramine (50 μm), U18666A (2.7 μm), or ethanol (<1%) as a solvent control. The medium was discarded, and the cells were rinsed and overlaid with medium containing 10% serum plus the agents or ethanol as before. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were processed and assayed for [3H] in cholesteryl linoleate, cholesteryl oleate, cholesteryl palmitate, and cholesterol as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Panel A gives percent hydrolysis calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 1 for (from the left) control (C) cells, cells treated with progesterone (PG), imipramine (IM), and U18666A (U).

The lysosomes (Fig. 5 A, marked by β-galactosidase) were well resolved from plasma membranes (Fig. 5, B and C, marked by cholesterol mass). Furthermore, the distribution of these markers was the same for treated and untreated cells. The major fraction of the [3H]cholesterol released from lysosomes was found in association with the plasma membranes both in control cells (Fig.5 B) and progesterone-treated cells (Fig. 5 C). Similar results also were obtained with imipramine (not shown). These findings are consistent with the results obtained with cholesterol oxidase (Fig. 4), which suggested that progesterone and imipramine had no effect on movement of lysosomal cholesterol to the plasma membrane. The agreement of the results using subcellular fractionation and cholesterol oxidase validates the use of this probe. It was shown earlier that this enzyme does not have access to intracellular cholesterol pools in fixed cells (20Lange Y. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 315-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, lysosomal cholesterol was not addressed specifically in those experiments. Recent studies of cells induced to accumulate lysosomal cholesterol by treatment with amphiphiles have confirmed that this intracellular pool is not a substrate for cholesterol oxidase. 2Y. Lange, and T. L. Steck, manuscript submitted for publication. The finding that progesterone, imipramine, and U18666A have little effect on the appearance of lysosomal cholesterol in the plasma membrane suggests that these agents do not inhibit movement out of lysosomes. Therefore, we examined whether they affect the re-esterification of lysosomal cholesterol. Cells were loaded with [3H]LDL for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of various amphipaths and then chased for a further 4 h at 37 °C prior to assay of [3H]cholesteryl linoleate hydrolysis and re-esterification. We found that 38% of the [3H]cholesteryl linoleate was hydrolyzed in the control cells, and that 7.5% of this became re-esterified (Fig.6). Progesterone, imipramine, and U18666A all caused a moderate decrease in the amount of labeled [3H]cholesteryl linoleate hydrolyzed, but profoundly inhibited the re-esterification of the released [3H]cholesterol. We have shown by measuring esterification in cell homogenates supplemented with saturating amounts of cholesterol delivered in Triton WR-1339 that 12 μmprogesterone inhibits ACAT activity by less than 20% (15Lange Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3411-3414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similar experiments showed that U18666A and imipramine have no effect on ACAT activity at 2.7 and 50 μm, respectively (data not shown); these were the concentrations used in Fig. 6. That U18666A does not inhibit ACAT also was concluded from the observation that the amphiphile had no effect on the synthesis of cholesteryl oleate in cells treated with 25-hydroxycholesterol (5Underwood K.W. Andemariam B. McWilliams G.L. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1556-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that progesterone (21Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J.

Neurosci. 1991; 13: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) cause the dramatic accumulation of cholesterol in the lysosomes of cultured fibroblasts. This finding was explained by the subsequent observation that these compounds appeared to inhibit cholesterol movement from lysosomes to the plasma membrane (21Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Peterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M., T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol.

The latter hypothesis was supported by more recent studies in which cholesterol oxidase was used to distinguish cholesterol in the plasma membrane from that in intracellular pools (5Underwood K.W. Andemariam B. McWilliams G.L. Liscum L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1556-1568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the results shown in Figs. 4 and5 suggest that the amphiphiles have no effect on cholesterol transfer from lysosomes to plasma membrane. The reason for the discrepancy between our results and the earlier ones is not clear. Since it appears that the amphiphiles do not inhibit cholesterol egress from lysosomes (Figs. 4 and 5), its accumulation in the lysosomes of treated cells (21Butler J.D. Blanchette-Mackie J. Goldin E. O'Neill R.R. Carstea G. Roff C.F. Peterson M.C. Patel S. Comly M.E. Cooney A. Vanier M., T. Brady R.O. Pentchev P.G. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 1991; 13: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) must have another explanation. In this regard, we have shown recently that treating cells with these amphiphiles induces the accumulation of excess sterol at the cell surface, which then is transferred to lysosomes in a process not normally visible.2 Thus, the large amount of lysosomal cholesterol found in amphiphile-treated cells is not trapped there but appears to be dynamically derived from the plasma membrane. The second major finding presented here relates to the fate of [3H]cholesterol released from LDL [3H]cholesteryl linoleate in lysosomes. The lag in esterification of the sterol suggests that it passes through an intermediate compartment prior to esterification in the ER. This compartment could be intracellular; however, we shall argue below that it is most likely to be the plasma membrane. Fig. 1 C shows that most of the [3H]cholesterol released in lysosomes moves immediately to the plasma membrane (also see Ref. 4Brasaemle D.L. Attie A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 103-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 85% of cell-free [3H]cholesterol was associated with the plasma membrane at all times during the chase. The fraction of cell cholesterol mass in the oxidizable pool was also 85% (not shown, but see Ref. 20Lange Y. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 315-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Of the ∼15% of unoxidized cell cholesterol mass, a major fraction has been shown to be endocytic (20Lange Y. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 315-321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the data suggest that most, and perhaps all, of the [3H]cholesterol emerging from the lysosomes immediately moved to the cell surface and its derivatives. The question then becomes whether there is evidence for a direct pathway from lysosome to ER, however minor in magnitude. As outlined below, our findings suggest not. It can be argued from the kinetic data in Figs. 1, 2, 3 that the cholesterol emerging from the lysosomes mixed with cholesterol from the plasma membrane prior to re-esterification in the ER. If, upon release from the lysosomes, cholesterol had moved directly to the ER, the time course of its esterification would have been hyperbolic, as was the time course of its arrival at the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 C). However, this was not observed (Fig. 1 B). We interpret the lag in the re-esterification of the ingested [3H]cholesterol to reflect the profound isotope dilution that this probe experiences upon delivery to the plasma membrane. The accelerating time course would then reflect the progressive rise in the specific labeling of the plasma membrane cholesterol pool. Furthermore, the rate of esterification of lysosomal cholesterol still was increasing sharply after approximately 1 h of chase, even though the rate of hydrolysis of [3H]cholesteryl esters had begun to level off (Fig. 1, A and B). In contrast, the kinetics of movement of [3H]cholesterol to the plasma membrane paralleled the hydrolysis of the [3H]cholesteryl linoleate (Fig. 1, A andC), consistent with a direct relationship between the two processes. If lysosomal cholesterol had moved directly to the ER, its representation in the nascent ester pool would initially have been at least as great as that of plasma membrane cholesterol. That this was not the case is shown in Fig. 3, B. It is also significant that while the esterification of plasma membrane [14C]cholesterol initially was proportionately greater than that of lysosomal [3H]cholesterol, the contributions from the two pools equalized after 2–3 h of chase (Fig. 3,B). This result suggests that both labels had entered the same substrate pool, namely the plasma membrane. The inhibition of the esterification of lysosomal cholesterol by progesterone, U18666A, and imipramine (Fig. 6) is unlikely to be due to a block in the export of cholesterol from lysosomes since transfer to the plasma membrane is unaffected by these agents (Fig. 4). Nor can it be attributed to inhibition of ACAT activity that is essentiallly unaffected by the concentrations used in these experiments. Rather, we suggest that the block in esterification is due to the inhibition of movement of plasma cholesterol to the ER by the amphiphiles (14Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29371-29374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That is, the most parsimonious hypothesis is that these compounds act at a single site. In this case, there is no need to postulate a direct route of cholesterol movement from lysosomes to ER. The analysis presented above assumes that if cholesterol movement from lysosomes to ER occurs, it is as rapid as is transfer to the plasma membrane. The amphiphiles could, in principle, inhibit transfer through an intracellular membrane in the pathway from lysosomes to ER. Nonetheless, the simplest hypothesis that explains all our data is that only one major intermediate compartment is involved, the plasma membrane. While the bulk of cellular free cholesterol resides in the plasma membrane, the proteins that regulate cholesterol homeostasis are in the ER. We have proposed that the abundance of cholesterol in the plasma membrane (and hence in the cell) is communicated to the ER by a stream of cholesterol that moves bi-directionally between these two compartments (14Lange Y. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29371-29374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Lange Y. Steck T.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 205-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It makes sense in terms of this model that lysosomal cholesterol does not move directly to the ER but first enters the plasma membrane. In this way, ingested cholesterol is integrated into the bulk pool that determines the extent of cholesterol transfer to the ER for esterification and other regulatory reactions (24Lange Y. Steck T.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 205-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. T. L.

MSP activates the RON receptor protein-tyrosine kinase, which results in cell migration, shape change, or proliferation. A structure-activity study of MSP was performed using pro-MSP, MSP, MSP α and β chains, and a complex including the first two kringles and IgG Fc (MSP-NK2). Radioiodinated MSP and MSP β chain both bound specifically to RON. The K d of 1.4 nm for MSP β chain is higher than the reportedK d range of 0.6–0.8 nm for MSP. Pro-MSP, MSP α chain, and MSP-NK2 did not bind. Only MSP stimulated RON autophosphorylation. Although the β chain bound to RON and partially inhibited MSP-induced RON phosphorylation in kidney 293 cells, it did not induce RON phosphorylation. Pro-MSP, MSP α chain, or MSP-NK2 failed to activate RON, consistent with their inability to bind to the RON receptor. Functional studies showed that only MSP induced cell migration, and shape change in resident macrophages, and growth of murine keratinocytes. Our data indicate that the primary receptor binding domain is located in a region of the MSP β chain, in contrast to structurally similar hepatocyte growth factor, in which the receptor binding site is in the α chain.

It is a 78-kDa heterodimeric protein composed of a disulfide-linked 53-kDa α chain and a 25-kDa β chain (calculated from amino acid composition). The α chain contains a N-terminal hairpin loop followed by four kringle domains. The β chain has a serine protease-like domain but is devoid of enzymatic activity due to amino acid substitutions in the catalytic triad. MSP belongs to the kringle protein family that includes plasminogen (2Sottrup-Jensen L. Zajdel M. Claeys H. Petersen T.E. Magnusson S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this work, we initiated a structure-activity study of MSP to identify functionally important domains that interact with the RON receptor. Five purified recombinant proteins were used, including pro-MSP, MSP, MSP α and β chains, and the MSP N terminus (including the first two kringles) fused to human IgG Fc. We report the binding capacity of MSP and its subunits to RON receptor in intact cells. We also analyzed the capacity of MSP and its subunits to induce receptor phosphorylation and consequent cellular responses. Human mature plasma MSP was purified as described (1Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Showalter S. Tanaka S. Appella E. Leonard E. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 173: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Human recombinant single chain pro-MSP was derived from CHO cells transfected with human MSP cDNA and purified in two steps by S-Sepharose and anti-MSP IgG affinity column chromatography. MSP α and β chains were obtained from kallikrein-treated pro-MSP and purified on a CM-Sepharose column.

Murine keratinocyte cell line PAM212, BK-1, and MK308 were provided by Dr. A. Dlugosz (NCI, Bethesda, MD). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 in air. Mouse peritoneal resident macrophages were obtained from C3H/HeN mice by lavage of the peritoneal cavity with 15 ml of sterile RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum (8Wang M.-H.

Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar) and equilibrated on ice for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.2m, pH 8.5, glycine borate buffer. The reaction mixture was then applied to an Excellulose GF-5 desalting column (Pierce) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% gelatin. Iodinated protein was eluted with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline-gelatin buffer and counted in a gamma counter (Gamma 5500, Beckman). The specific activity of the labeled proteins was about 200 Ci/mmol. CHO-MSP18 cells were incubated with 100 μCi of [35S]cysteine in cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without fetal bovine serum for 56 h. Under these conditions, all the recombinant protein is 35S-labeled single chain pro-MSP (8Wang M.-H. Yoshimura T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol.

Yoshimura T. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3436-3440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of MSP were determined by a specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (26Wang M.-H. Skeel A. Yoshimura T. Copeland T.D. Sakaguchi K. Leonard E.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 289-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions of cleaved35S-pro-MSP showed not only disulfide-linked mature MSP but also free α and β chain. We concluded that about 30% of the recombinant pro-MSP preparation did not have a disulfide link between its α and β chain, which results in free α and β chain after specific R-V bond cleavage. For the absorption assay, MDCK-RE7 or 3T3/STK cells (6 × 106 in 0.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium) were equilibrated with 0.5 nm35S-MSP mixtures at 0 °C for 2 h. Supernatants were collected, and rabbit anti-MSP IgG was added to precipitate the remaining MSP as well as MSP α and β chains; this was followed by the addition of protein G-Sepharose. After extensive washing with 0.1 m Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.15 m NaCl and 0.5% Tween 20, samples were separated on a 12% gel by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. The gel were treated with Enlightning for 20 min, dried at 75 °C, and exposed to film with an intensifying screen. Binding of 125I-MSP, MSP α, MSP β, or MSP-NK2 protein to MDCK-RE7, BK-1, MK308, and other cells was carried out as described (15Wang M.-H. Iwama A. Dlugosz A.A. Sun Y. Skeel A. Yuspa S.H. Suda T. Leonard E.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In steady-state binding assays, 3 × 105 cells were equilibrated in duplicate with increasing amounts of 125I-labeled MSP, MSP β, or MSP-NK2 in binding buffer (RPMI 1604 medium, pH 7.4, with 20 mm Hepes, and 100 μg/ml cytochrome c) in a total volume of 200 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined in parallel equilibrations with a 30-fold excess of unlabeled MSP, MSP β, or MSP-NK2. After 3 h at 0 °C, cells were pelleted through an oil cushion (18Wang M.-H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.-C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The tips of tubes containing cells were cut. Radioactivity in supernatants and tips was counted in a gamma counter. For estimation ofK d, a we used a linear regression to generate a straight line through Scatchard plot data points. A suspension of 5 × 106 cells in 1 ml of binding buffer was incubated with 5 nm MSP at 37 °C for different time intervals. Cell were then equilibrated for 30 min in 200 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm vanadate, 20 μg/ml leopeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor). Lysate proteins were precipitated with monoclonal antibody ID2 to RON or rabbit anti-STK serum coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads. Samples were dissolved in sample buffer with 2-mercaptoethanol, separated on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.15 m pH 7.6 Tris buffer with 0.5% Tween 20, then incubated with 0.2 μg/ml anti-phosphotyrosine antibody overnight, followed by goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The horseradish peroxidase reaction was developed with ECL detection reagents. In some experiments, the membrane was treated with SDS/2-mecaptoethanol erasure buffer and reprobed with rabbit anti-RON serum as described (18Wang M.-H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.-C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Murine peritoneal resident macrophages (5 × 105/ml) were incubated in 1 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium in 24-well tissue culture plates. MSP, MSP subunits, or their different combinations were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, cells were photographed. The assay was done as described (18Wang M.-H. Ronsin C. Gesnel M.-C. Coupey L. Skeel A. Leonard E.J. Breathnach R. Science. 1994; 266: 117-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Bottom wells of a chemotaxis chamber were filled in triplicate with 30 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing different amounts of MSP or MSP subunits and then covered with a polycarbonate membrane coated with mouse collagen IV. Upper wells were filled with 45 μl of cell suspension (2 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium). To see the effect of MSP subunits on MSP-induced migration, cells were first mixed with 5 or 30 nm of MSP α or β chain or MSP-NK2 and then added to top wells. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, the chamber was disassembled, and the membranes were dried in air. The migrated cells were stained and counted with an image analyzer. The results were expressed as the percentage of input cells that migrated. The experiments were performed as described (15Wang M.-H. Iwama A. Dlugosz A.A. Sun Y. Skeel A. Yuspa S.H. Suda T. Leonard E.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). BK-1 cells at a concentration of 105/ml of a serum-free medium (equal volumes of keratinocyte serum free-medium, Eagle's minimum essential medium, and CHO-SF medium) were seeded at 100 μl/well in a 96-well culture plate. MSP, MSP α or β chains, MSP-NK2, or their different combinations were added. Cells without stimulation served as control. After incubation for 5 days, cells were stained and lysed in 1% SDS buffer. Color intensity was measured at 570 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Absorbance was converted into cell number by reference to a standard curve derived from stained cell concentration. In the course of studying pro-MSP conversion into mature MSP, we noticed that about 30% of our metabolically35S-labeled recombinant pro-MSP lacked the disulfide link between its α and β chain, which resulted in free α and β chain after specific cleavage by kallikrein of the pro-MSP R-V bond at the αβ chain junction (data not shown). We took advantage of this finding to determine if free α or β chain binds to the MSP receptor (human RON or murine STK) using an absorption assay. When35S-labeled pro-MSP was cleaved by kallikrein and then equilibrated with RON-expressing MDCK-RE7 cells or 3T3/STK cells as absorbents, MSP β chain in recovered supernatants from both MDCK-RE7 and 3T3/STK cells was significantly reduced, as analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). By densitometric comparison with nontransfected control cells, about 80% of fluid phase MSP β chain was absorbed by MDCK-RE7 cells, and about 50% was absorbed by 3T3/STK cells. In contrast, the level of MSP α chain did not change. Absorption by these cells suggested that the MSP β chain might bind to the RON receptor. We tested for binding of radiolabeled pure MSP and its subunits to murine keratinocyte BK1 and MK308 cells, which express 10,000–15,000 STK receptors/cell (15Wang M.-H. Iwama A. Dlugosz A.A. Sun Y. Skeel A. Yuspa S.H. Suda T. Leonard E.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows that in both cell lines, specific binding of125I-MSP was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by unlabeled MSP β chain but not by MSP α chain. On a molar basis, MSP is more potent than the free β chain as a competitive inhibitor of labeled MSP binding. Pro-MSP did not compete with MSP for RON, as previously reported (15Wang M.-H. Iwama A. Dlugosz A.A. Sun Y. Skeel A. Yuspa S.H. Suda T. Leonard E.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 226: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Binding of 125I-MSP β chain to MDCK-RE7 cells is shown in Fig. 4. Binding of the MSP β chain to the RON receptor was specific; either unlabeled MSP or MSP β chain inhibited binding of 125I-MSP β chain. From Fig. 4 C, we estimated a K d for binding of the MSP β chain of about 1.7 nm, higher than the K d values of 0.6 to 0.8 for binding of MSP to the RON receptor (17Wang M.-H. Montero-Julian F.A. Dauny I. Leonard E.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2167-2175PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, we did not detect specific binding of the MSP α chain to the RON receptor (data not shown). The relatively low binding of125I-MSP-NK2 to the cell surface was unaffected by unlabeled MSP or MSP-NK2, indicating that the interaction of labeled MSP-NK2 with MDCK-RE7 cells is nonspecific (Fig. 5).Figure 5Absence of specific binding of125I-MSP-NK2 to MDCK-RE7 cells. Equilibration conditions were as described for the experiment illustrated in Fig. 4. Nonspecific binding was determined by equilibration with a 30-fold excess of unlabeled MSP-NK2 or MSP. The results from one of two experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next studied tyrosine phosphorylation of RON induced by pro-MSP, MSP, and its subunits in kidney 293 and MDCK-RE7 cells. After precipitation of proteins with ID2 anti-RON, Western blot with monoclonal antibody 4G10 to phosphotyrosine showed that only MSP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 150-kDa RON β chain (Fig. 6 A). No phosphorylated proteins were observed in cells treated with pro-MSP, MSP α chain, or MSP-NK2 protein. Interestingly, although MSP β chain binds to RON, it failed to induce RON autophosphorylation, indicating that MSP β chain alone is insufficient to activate RON. Experiments were also designed to study if MSP α chain, MSP β chain, or NK2 protein could modulate RON phosphorylation. Fig. 6 B shows that high concentrations of MSP β chain could partially inhibit MSP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of RON. No inhibition was observed by MSP α chain or MSP-NK2 protein. To see if MSP subunits can induce cell shape change or migration, mouse peritoneal resident macrophages were used. Fig.7 shows that MSP α, MSP β or MSP-NK2 protein did not induce morphological changes in resident macrophages. In combination with MSP, none of these three subunits inhibited the biological effect of MSP on macrophages. Likewise, except for a statistically insignificant effect of MSP β, the addition of MSP subunits to macrophages did not inhibit their migration toward MSP as a chemoatractant (data not shown). BK-1 keratinocytes were used to assess if MSP α chain, MSP β chain, or MSP-NK2 protein at high concentration could affect MSP-induced cell proliferation. Table I shows that only MSP increased cell number after 5 days in culture, compared with the medium control. In combination experiments, none of the fragments affected MSP-induced proliferation, except for a small inhibition by 100 nm MSP β chain.Table IEffects of MSP and MSP subunits, alone or in combination, on proliferation of murine BK-1 keratinocytesStimulusCell number at 5 days, ×10−4Ratio1-aObserved cell numbers divided by medium control cell number.Medium16.7 ± 0.07MSP (2 nm)38.9 ± 0.172.3MSP α chain (2 nm)15.3 ± 0.020.9MSP β chain (2 nm)18.9 ± 0.021.1NK2 (2 nm)18.6 ± 0.151.1MSP + α (30 nm)38.1 ± 0.312.3MSP + α (100 nm)37.0 ± 0.452.2MSP + β (30 nm)35.6 ± 0.42.1MSP + β (100 nm)28.2 ± 0.11.7MSP + NK2 (30 nm)36.3 ± 0.32.2MSP + NK2 (100 nm)36.0 ± 0.22.2The results represent one of two similar experiments.1-a Observed cell numbers divided by medium control cell number. Open table in a new tab The results represent one of two similar experiments. We have presented several lines of evidence that the MSP β chain binds to RON. 1) Metabolically labeled free β chain, but not α chain, was specifically absorbed by cells expressing the RON receptor. 2) 125I-β chain bound to RON in intact cells in a specific and saturable manner. 3) Not only unlabeled MSP but also β chain competitively inhibited binding of 125I-MSP to RON in intact cells. Thus, in contrast to the β chain of HGF/SF, which does not bind to its receptor (Met) (27Hartmann G. Naldini L. Weidner K.M. Sachs M. Vigna E. Comoglio P.M. Birchmeier W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the β chain of MSP appears to contain the primary binding site for the RON receptor. The β chain is the serine protease domain of kringle proteins (28Brenner S. Nature. 1988; 334: 528-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In HGF/SF and MSP, amino acid substitutions in the catalytic triad have eliminated the protease activity. It is possible that residues in the modified substrate pocket of the MSP β chain might form the binding site for RON. To obtain clues about the MSP binding domain, we have begun modeling of the MSP β chain for comparison with the published model of the HGF β chain (29Donate L.E. Gherardi E. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Aparicio S. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2378-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). MSP has Asp and Asn in the binding pocket, the corresponding locations of which are Gly in HGF. 2M. Miller, A. Danilkovitch, and E. J. Leonard, unpublished data. Substitution of these candidate residues, as well as two surface loop arginines, are now being made to evaluate their significance for receptor binding. There is one report that in RON cDNA-transfected COS-1 cells, MSP-NK2 stimulated RON phosphorylation (16Gaudino G. Follenzi A. Naldini L. Collesi C. Santoro M. Gallo K.A. Godowski P.J. Comoglio P.M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3524-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). MSP-NK2 is a recombinant protein comprising the first two kringles of the MSP α chain, fused to IgG Fc. We found that neither MSP-NK2 nor MSP α chain bound to RON on intact cells including kidney 293 and MDCK-RE7 cells. We cannot explain the reported activity of MSP-NK2, especially because the source of the MSP-NK2 was the same. However, our β chain data combined with the fact that free α chain does not bind to RON support the conclusion that MSP binds to its receptor via the β chain. We have shown that although the MSP β chain binds to RON, it does not cause biological activity or induce phosphorylation of the receptor, except for a small amount at high ligand concentrations. It is generally accepted that ligand binding to growth factor receptors is associated with receptor oligomerization and autophosphorylation (30Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar). Receptor oligomerization may be mediated by interaction of ligand pairs. In this context, our results indicate that receptor oligomerization requires an intact αβ chain disulfide-linked heterodimeric ligand. Although HGF differs from MSP in that the primary binding site resides in the α chain, two or three amino acid substitutions in the β chain are sufficient to reduce biological activity to less than 2% that of wild type HGF (31Lokker N.A. Godowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17145-17150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, for both MSP and HGF the αβ chain heterodimer is required to fully activate their respective receptors. An HGF dimer, formed by noncovalent interactions between kringles 2 and 3 of the protein pair, has been suggested as the moiety that induces dimerization and activation of MET (29Donate L.E. Gherardi E. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Aparicio S. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2378-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This idea is supported by a report of nonconvalent kringle-kringle interactions (32Padmanabhan K. Wu T.P. Ravichandran K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 898-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although MSP and HGF have different primary receptor binding regions, they may have a similar structural basis for receptor activation by dimer formation through kringle interactions. We plan to express and purify selected kringle regions of MSP and to determine their effects when added together with intact MSP to target cells. If receptor activation requires ligand dimerization by kringle interaction, the result could be no effect on MSP binding but inhibition of receptor phosphorylation. An interesting alternative mechanism for ligand-induced receptor dimerization is suggested by the crystal structure of human growth hormone and the extracellular domain of its receptor (33de Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2023) Google Scholar). The complex comprises one ligand molecule per two receptors. Two structurally unrelated regions of the ligand interact with similar binding surfaces of the two receptors. It has been proposed that receptor dimerization occurs by a sequential mechanism, because human growth hormone binds to a second receptor only if it has bound to the first receptor (34Cunningham B.C. Ultsch M. de Vos A.M. Mulkerrin M.G. Clauser K.R. Wells J.A. Science. 1991; 254: 821-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the fact that the contact surface for the binding site of the receptor I is about 30% larger than that for receptor II. The authors suggest that ligand binding to receptor II is stabilized by interaction between the two receptor domains near their C terminus. If this model applied to the RON receptor, the candidate region for binding to receptor I might be a cluster of β chain surface loop arginines2; a single arginine on the N domain hairpin loop of the α chain (29Donate L.E. Gherardi E. Srinivasan N. Sowdhamini R. Aparicio S. Blundell T.L. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2378-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) might mediate binding to receptor II. The Arg cluster density for the corresponding regions of HGF is reversed, which is consistent with receptor binding by the α chain. This model would account for primary binding by MSP β or HGF-α, and the requirement for binding by the αβ chain heterodimer for optimal receptor activation. The model should be readily testable by mutagenesis studies. We thank Dr. Teizo Yoshimura for providing the cDNA that was used for the production of recombinant pro-MSP. We also thank Dr. C. Ronsin for expressing the RON-GST fusion protein used for generation of monoclonal antibody ID2 and Dr. Maria Miller for helpful discussions about molecular structure and for calling our attention to the model of growth factor receptor dimerization."
https://openalex.org/W2003915950,"Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a potent inhibitor of blood coagulation factor Xa (fXa) and factor VIIa. We have recently shown that fXa binding stimulates the uptake and degradation of cell surface-bound 125I-TFPI (Ho, G., Toomey, J. R., Broze, G. J., Jr., and Schwartz, A. L. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9497–9502). In the present study we examined the role of cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in this process. Removal of cell surface GAG chains by treatment of cells with heparinase or heparitinase but not chondroitinase markedly reduced fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI uptake and degradation. Inhibition of GAG sulfation by growth of cells in chlorate-containing medium similarly decreased fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation. These results suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are required for the uptake and degradation of 125I-TFPI·fXa complexes. Chemical cross-linking/immunoprecipitation analyses revealed that 125I-TFPI was directly associated with HSPGs on the cell surface and that fXa binding increased the amount of125I-TFPI bound. Of the several cell lines evaluated, bend endothelial cells demonstrated the greatest fXa stimulation of125I-TFPI uptake and degradation. Cross-linking/immunoprecipitation analyses on bend cells also revealed that HSPGs were specifically associated with TFPI and fXa.

Coagulation factor Xa (fXa), 1The abbreviations used are: fXa, factor Xa; TFPI, tissue factor pathway inhibitor; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; LRP, low density lipoprotein-related protein; DTSSP, dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. a serine protease positioned at the convergence of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of the coagulation cascade, plays a central role in hemostasis. Activated fXa along with phospholipids and factor Va converts prothrombin to thrombin, which in turn generates the fibrin clot. The nonthrombogenic properties of the endothelial cell surface are maintained in part by protease inhibitors of the coagulation cascade. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a potent direct inhibitor of fXa and, in a fXa-dependent fashion, produces feedback inhibition of the factor VIIa-tissue factor catalytic complex (1Broze G.J.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F. Higuchi D.A. Girard J.J. Miletich J.P. Blood. 1988; 71: 335-343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The TFPI molecule consists of three tandem Kunitz-type protease inhibitor domains and a basic C-terminal region (2Wun T.-C. Kretzmer K.K. Girard T.J. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6001-6004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its second Kunitz domain is required for binding to fXa, and its first Kunitz domain appears to bind factor VIIa in the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex (1Broze G.J.J. Warren L.A. Novotny W.F.

Nature. 1989; 338: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Unlike other coagulation protease inhibitors, whose binding is irreversible, TFPI binds to the proteases in a reversible manner (4Broze G.J.J. Girard T.J. Novotny W.F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7539-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 5Huang Z.-F. Wun T.-C. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26950-26955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Instead of transferring fXa to other protease inhibitors for final inactivation, we have shown that cell surface-bound TFPI mediates125I-fXa uptake and degradation and, reciprocally, fXa binding stimulates the uptake and degradation of cell surface-bound125I-TFPI (6Ho G. Toomey J.R. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9497-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Unlike the uptake and degradation of uncomplexed 125I-TFPI, which is mediated via the endocytic receptor low density lipoprotein-related protein (LRP) (7Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the uptake and degradation of the fXa·TFPI complex is independent of LRP (6Ho G. Toomey J.R. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9497-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence suggests that TFPI may be bound to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the endothelial cell surface. This notion derives from the following facts. (a) TFPI binds to heparin agarose (8Wesselschimidt R. Likert K. Girald T. Wun T.-C. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2004-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (b) heparin and sulfated polysaccharides enhance the anticoagulant activity of TFPI (9Wun T.-C. Blood. 1992; 79: 430-438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (c) after intravenous administration of heparin, plasma levels of TFPI increase severalfold (10Sanset P.M. Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Thromb.

Blood. 1991; 78: 394-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and (d) heparin competes for abundant TFPI binding sites on the cell surface (7Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In the present investigation, we attempted to address whether GAGs play a role in the uptake and degradation of the fXa·TFPI complex. Using PEA 13 fibroblasts, a cell line deficient in LRP (14Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we show that enzymatic removal of cell surface heparin sulfate or growth of cells in chlorate reduced fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation. Chemical cross-linking of 125I-TFPI to cells coupled with immunoprecipitation analyses showed an association of high molecular weight species with 125I-TFPI and enhancement following fXa binding. These data suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) may directly serve as the receptor for the uptake and degradation of TFPI·fXa complexes. IODOGEN and dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl propionate) (DTSSP) were purchased from Pierce. [125I]Iodide was from Amersham Corp. Heparitinase (EC4.2.2.8) and chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4) were from ICN. Heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7, heparinase I), bovine serum albumin, and normal rabbit (nonimmune) IgG were from Sigma. Sodium chlorate and sodium sulfate were purchased from Aldrich. Immobilized rProtein A beads were from RepliGen (Cambridge, MA). Human factor Xa, goat-anti-human factor X polyclonal antibody, and normal goat IgG were obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). Anti-TFPI polyclonal antibodies were described previously (15Broze G.J.J. Lange G.W. Duffin K.L. MacPhail L. Blood Coag. Fibrinol. 1994; 5: 551-559PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue culture media and plasticware were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Proteins (10–50 μg) were iodinated using the IODOGEN methods (16Bu G. Morton P.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mouse brain endothelial cells (bend-3, gift of Dr. W. Frazier, Washington University at St. Louis) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with glutamine) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. Cells were seeded into 12-well dishes 1 day prior to assays. Cell monolayers were generally used at 70–80% confluence. Assay buffers were Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% bovine serum albumin. In general, binding was carried out by washing cell monolayers with prechilled assay buffer twice and binding was initiated by adding 0.5 ml of 4 °C assay buffer containing 125I-labeled proteins or unlabeled proteins. After incubation at 4 °C for the time duration specified in the figure legends, overlying buffer containing unbound ligand was removed, and the cells were washed three times with 4 °C assay buffer. The cells were then incubated for a second round of binding as indicated in the figure legends. Degradation assays were carried out at 37 °C for 3 h in 0.5 ml of assay buffer. Radioligands were either prebound to the cell surface or contained in the assay buffer as indicated in the figure legends. Thereafter, the medium overlying the cell monolayers was removed and proteins were precipitated by addition of bovine serum albumin to 5 mg/ml and trichloroacetic acid to 10%. Degradation of radioligand was defined as the appearance of radioactive fragments in the overlying medium that were soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. Degradation of125I-ligand in parallel dishes that did not contain cells was subtracted from the total degradation (17Owensby D.A. Sobel E.B. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10587-10594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells grown in 12-well dishes (∼70% confluence) were digested at 37 °C for 1.5 h in assay buffer containing the appropriate enzymes at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Chemical cross-linking was performed as described (18Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1994: 199-204Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (70–80% confluence) were incubated at 4 °C with assay buffer containing the desired concentrations of TFPI. After removing unbound ligand by washing twice with assay buffer, the cell monolayers were incubated at 4 °C with assay buffer alone or containing the desired concentrations of fXa. The cells were then washed with PBS supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2and 0.5 mm MgCl2 (PBSc). Cross-linking of ligands to the cells was performed by incubating cell monolayers with PBSc containing 0.5 mm DTSSP. After 30 min at 4 °C, the reaction was quenched by washing cells with Tris-buffered saline. Cells were then lysed in PBSc containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 30 min at 4 °C with intermittent votexing, followed by brief sonication at low power output. The cell lysates were subsequently used for immunoprecipitation. Cell lysates from chemical cross-linking experiments were mixed with equal volumes of PBSc containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% SDS, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (immunomix). The mixture was aliquoted, and appropriate antibodies were added (10 μg of IgG in a volume of ∼0.4 ml). After rocking overnight at 4 °C, the immunomixture was incubated with 30 μl of Protein A bead slurry at room temperature for 1 h. The Protein A beads were collected by spinning for 30 s at top speed in a Microfuge, washed twice with immunomix and twice with PBSc. The immunoprecipitates bound to Protein A beads were released by boiling for 5 min in 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol (Laemmli SDS sample buffer) (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) without 2-β-mercaptoethanol. SDS samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) under nonreducing conditions. A set of prestained molecular weight standards (myosin, β-galactosidase, bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin) (Bio-Rad) was included for molecular weight estimation. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray films for visualization. We have previously shown that cell surface-bound125I-TFPI was degraded at very low rates by PEA 13 cells but that this basal degradation rate is enhanced 5-fold upon binding of125I-TFPI to fXa (6Ho G. Toomey J.R. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9497-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since PEA 13 cells are devoid of LRP (14Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this observation suggests that the fXa-stimulated125I-TFPI degradation is mediated via a non-LRP endocytic pathway. TFPI has been proposed to bind GAGs on the cell surface (10Sanset P.M. Abildgaard U. Larsen M.L. Thromb. Res. 1988; 50: 803-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 11Novotny W.F. Palmier M. Wun T.-C. Broze Jr., G.J. Miletich J.P.

To investigate the role of GAGs in TFPI·fXa degradation, PEA 13 cells were incubated with heparinase or heparitinase (1 unit/ml), which cleave GAG heparan sulfate moieties at distinct sites (20Ototani N. Kikuchi M. Yoshizawa Z. Carbohydr. Res. 1981; 88: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The enzyme-treated cells were then incubated at 4 °C with125I-TFPI to allow for binding, followed by incubation at 4 °C in the presence or absence of fXa. Thereafter, degradation of125I-TFPI was assessed at 37 °C. As shown in TableI, degradation of fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI, measured as the difference in 125I-TFPI degraded in the presence and absence of fXa, was reduced to ∼48% of control (TableI). Removal of GAG chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate by treating cells with chondroitinase ABC (21Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Nakazawa K. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), however, did not affect fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation (Table I). Since heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate represent the two major types of GAGs (22Kjellén L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 443-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar), these data suggest that HSPGs participate in the uptake and degradation of TFPI·fXa complexes. The maximal effect of heparinase on fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation was determined, as shown in Fig. 1. The amount of fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation decreased with increasing concentrations of heparinase, reaching a maximal effect that was 20% of the control, at 4 units/ml heparinase. These data thus suggest that HSPGs play a major role in the uptake and degradation of fXa·TFPI complexes.Figure 2Chlorate inhibits fXa-stimulated125I-TFPI degradation. PEA 13 cells were cultured for 2 days in medium containing various concentrations of sodium chlorate with or without additional 10 mm sodium sulfate.

The mean ± S.D. are derived from at least three independent experiments. The C-terminal heparin-binding domain of TFPI consists of a cluster of positively charged residues, truncation of which abolishes the binding of TFPI to the cell surface (23Warshawsky I. Bu G. Mast A. Saffitz J.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine whether the negatively charged sulfate groups on HSPGs were critical for TFPI·fXa binding and degradation, PEA 13 cells were cultured in medium containing chlorate, a competitive inhibitor of ATP sulfurylase (24Farley J.R. Nakayama G. Cryns D. Segel I.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 185: 376-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells grown in media containing various concentrations of chlorate were then analyzed for degradation of 125I-TFPI in the presence or absence of fXa as described above. As shown in Fig. 2, growth of cells for more than four doublings in the presence of chlorate reduced the level of fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation in a dose-dependent fashion. At 30 mm chlorate, the level of degradation was reduced to 9% of the control value. To assure that the inhibition by chlorate was not due to cytotoxicity but was a result of competitive inhibition of sulfation, cells were cultured in medium containing chlorate (20 mm or 30 mm) as well as sulfate (10 mm). As shown in Fig. 2, degradation of125I-TFPI was fully rescued by simultaneous addition of sulfate in the medium. These data indicate that degradation of fXa·TFPI complexes requires sulfate groups on HSPGs, and support the observation from Fig. 1 that HSPGs play a key role in the uptake and degradation of the TFPI·fXa complex by cells. In addition to serving as a binding site for fXa on the cell surface (25Kazama Y. Komiyama Y. Kisiel W. Blood. 1993; 81: 676-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have shown that TFPI also mediates the cellular uptake and degradation of fXa (6Ho G. Toomey J.R. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9497-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To determine whether that fXa degradation was similarly affected by HSPGs, fXa was radiolabeled and its degradation was analyzed in PEA 13 cells that were either treated with 1 unit/ml heparinase or cultured in 10 mm chlorate. The respective cells were then incubated at 4 °C with TFPI to allow for binding. Following washing to remove unbound TFPI, the cell monolayers were then incubated with various concentrations of 125I-fXa and the degradation was evaluated upon incubation at 37 °C as above. As shown in Fig. 3 A, heparinase treatment reduced TFPI-mediated 125I-fXa degradation by ∼50% at each concentration used. Growing cells in chlorate also markedly decreased 125I-fXa degradation (Fig. 3 B), and this inhibitory effect was abrogated in cells cultured with an additional 5 mm sulfate (Fig. 3 B). We have shown previously that the cellulardegradation of uncomplexed 125I-TFPI is inhibited >80% both by antibodies directed against LRP and by the 39-kDa protein, an LRP-associated protein that inhibits all ligand interactions with LRP (7Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). LRP, however, is not the major cell surface receptor, as the vast majority of 125I-TFPI binding is not inhibitable by the 39-kDa protein (7Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Warshawsky I. Herz J. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol.

HSPGs have been proposed as the initial binding site for several LRP ligands in addition to TFPI (7Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9307-9312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and thrombospondin (28Godyna S. Liau G. Popa I. Stefansson S. Argraves W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), whose uptake and degradation by LRP requires HSPGs. To further determine the role of HSPGs in the LRP-mediated uptake and degradation of TFPI, degradation of125I-TFPI was analyzed in PEA 10 cells, which express LRP (14Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with 2 units/ml heparinase or grown in medium containing 10 mm chlorate as described in Fig. 3. The cells were then incubated with 125I-TFPI at 37 °C to assess degradation. As shown in Fig. 4, neither treatment of PEA 10 cells with heparinase nor culture of cells in chlorate affected 125I-TFPI degradation. We showed previously that fXa-stimulated125I-TFPI degradation results from an enhanced uptake of125I-TFPI by cells (6Ho G. Toomey J.R. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9497-9502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). One potential explanation for this notion is that the interaction of TFPI for its endocytic receptor is increased upon association with fXa, resulting in the enhanced cellular uptake. To address this question as well as to define candidate receptors for the fXa·TFPI complex, chemical cross-linking coupled with immunoprecipitation analyses was performed. Initially fXa was radioiodinated and cross-linking was performed on PEA 13 cells. Cells were incubated with or without TFPI at 4 °C, followed by incubation with 125I-fXa to allow for binding. Chemical cross-linking of the bound ligands to the cells was performed with DTSSP, a thio-cleavable, water-soluble, and membrane-impermeable reagent (29Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13002-13009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After cross-linking, the cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI or anti-fX polyclonal antibodies. To characterize membrane proteins cross-linked to 125I-fXa, the immunoprecipitates were resolved on 7.5% SDS gels under nonreducing conditions. As shown in Fig. 5 A, in the presence of TFPI prebinding and DTSSP, a high molecular weight (highM r) band at the top of the gel was immunoprecipitated by both anti-fX and anti-TFPI antibodies (lanes 3 and 6), suggesting its association with125I-fXa as well as TFPI. The specificity of association is affirmed by showing that this high M r band is absent without the cross-linking reagent (lanes 4 and7) and is not precipitated by normal rabbit IgG (lane 1). The high M r band is undetectable when cells were not prebound with TFPI (lane 2), suggesting that binding of 125I-fXa to the high M rband is mediated by TFPI. Species at size ∼90 kDa are free cross-linked 125I-fXa·TFPI complexes (lanes 3and 6). Intense bands at 50 kDa are free125I-fXa (lanes 3 and 4). Since 125I-fXa binding to the highM r band is mediated through TFPI, we next examined the effect of fXa on 125I-TFPI binding to the receptor by cross-linking/immunoprecipitation analyses. PEA 13 cells were incubated at 4 °C with 125I-TFPI and thereafter with or without fXa at 4 °C. Subsequent cross-linking and immunoprecipitation were performed as above. As shown in Fig.5 B, in the absence of fXa addition but presence of DTSSP, the same high M r band was immunoprecipitated with anti-TFPI antibodies (lane 4). The band intensity, however, was enhanced when cells were incubated with fXa prior to cross-linking (lane 5). Densitometric analysis showed a 2.7-fold enhancement. These data indicate that fXa binding increases the interaction of TFPI with the high M r band species. The high M r band was precipitated by anti-fX antibodies in the presence of fXa and DTSSP (lane 2) but not in the absence of either cross-linking (lane 3) or prior fXa binding (lane 1), reaffirming the specific association of the high M r band with the TFPI·fXa complex. In the absence of cross-linking (lane 6), there appears to be a high M r band at the top of the gel. This is likely the result of high background during sample preparation. To confirm the identity of the highM r species as HSPGs, PEA 13 cells were treated with heparinase prior to binding to 125I-TFPI and fXa. The cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with anti-TFPI antibodies were conducted in an identical manner to that in Fig. 5 B. As shown in Fig. 5 C, heparinase pretreatment diminished the intensity of the high M r band (lane 2) (∼ 2.9-fold reduction) relative to the control (lane 1). These results demonstrate that TFPI and fXa are indeed associated with cell surface HSPGs and that the reduced uptake and degradation of fXa·TFPI complexes observed in Table I and Figs. 1 and3 is likely secondary to the reduction of TFPI binding to the cells following heparinase treatment. Under physiological conditions, fXa·TFPI complexes form within the vasculature. Thus, we compared the relative ability of the bend-3 microvasculature endothelial cells, hepatoma HepG2, and fibroblast PEA 10 cells to undergo the fXa-stimulated TFPI degradation. All of these cell lines express functional LRP. The cells were incubated at 4 °C with radiolabeled TFPI to allow for cell surface binding. After washing to remove unbound radioligand, 125I-TFPI degradation was assessed in the absence or presence of varying concentrations of fXa. As shown in Fig.6, in the absence of fXa the degradation of125I-TFPI was ∼6, 40, and 90 fmol/106 cells for bend, PEA 13, and HepG2, respectively. These rates essentially reflect the amount of 125I-TFPI degraded via LRP. With increasing concentrations of fXa added, bend cells exhibited >10-fold enhancement in 125I-TFPI degradation, whereas PEA 10 and HepG2 cells displayed only ∼1.5- and ∼1.1-fold enhancement, respectively. These data thus suggest that bend cells express low levels of LRP but high levels of the endocytic receptor for the TFPI·fXa complex. The fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation in bend cells was also markedly reduced by treatments of cells with heparinase, heparitinase, and chlorate (data not shown). The possibility that bend cells may express high levels of TFPI·fXa specific endocytic receptors prompted us to examine the receptor(s) in this cell line. Under the conditions described in Fig. 5, TFPI was radiolabeled, cross-linked to bend cells, and immunoprecipitated with anti-fXa and anti-TFPI antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were run on SDS gels under non-reducing conditions. As shown in Fig.7 A, a high M r band was cross-linked to 125I-TFPI (lane 4), and the band intensity was greatly potentiated in the presence of fXa (lane 5). Densitometric analysis showed a 8.7-fold enhancement. Similar to that seen in Fig. 5 B, this high M rband-125I-TFPI complex was also specifically cross-linked to fXa (lane 2). To ascertain the identity of the highM r band as HSPGs, heparinase treatment of bend cells was carried out as in Fig. 5 C. As shown in Fig.7 B, heparinase-treated cells displayed a 2.7-fold reduced level of surface-bound 125I-TFPI·fXa complexes. These data demonstrate that HSPGs are also the binding species for fXa·TFPI complexes on the endothelial cell. Using both enzymatic and chemical approaches, we have shown that fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI uptake and degradation by PEA 13 cells requires cell surface HSPGs. Similarly, HSPGs are necessary for TFPI-mediated 125I-fXa uptake and degradation. Using chemical cross-linking in combination with immunoprecipitation analyses, we have demonstrated that 125I-TFPI is physically associated with HSPGs on the PEA 13 cells and that TFPI's interaction with HSPGs is potentiated upon association with fXa. Of the various cell lines examined for fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation, the bend endothelial cell displays the highest level of enhancement, suggesting high levels of the endocytic receptor(s) for the fXa·TFPI complex are present in these cells. Cross-linking/immunoprecipitation analysis performed with bend cells also revealed HSPGs as binding species for TFPI·fXa complexes. Thus the direct association of the TFPI·fXa complex with HSPGs on the cell surface of both PEA 13 and bend cells, as well as the diminution of125I-TFPI·fXa degradation by cells following removal of HSPGs from the cell surface, strongly suggest that HSPGs as receptors for the uptake and degradation of the TFPI·fXa complex. Chlorate and heparinase treatments reduced the fXa-stimulated 125I-TFPI degradation to 10–20% of control (Figs. 1 and 2), and the reduced levels do not seem to have plateaued in the dose-response curves (Figs.1 and 2). Thus it is likely that HSPGs are the major, if not the only, endocytic receptors for the fXa·TFPI complex. HSPGs are a complex and heterogeneous family of macromolecules composed of linear sulfated polyaccharide chains, the heparan sulfate moieties, that are covalently attached to core proteins (30Gallagher J.T. Lyon M. Steward W.P. Biochem. J. 1986; 236: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 31Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). HSPGs are ubiquitously distributed on the plasma membrane. They are anchored to the membrane either via a linkage with membrane phospholipid (32David G. Lories V. Decock B. Marynen P. Cassiman J.-J. Van der Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 3165-3176Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) or via a hydrophobic transmembrane domain (33Kjellén L. Oldberg A. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10407-10413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane HSPGs have been implicated in an array of cellular functions, among which are ligand binding and endocytosis (31Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 34Esko J.D. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 805-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Apart from serving as initial binding sites for ligands that are eventually transferred to classical endocytic receptors (e.g. LRP) for cellular uptake and degradation (26Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kounnas M.Z. Chappell D.A. Wong H. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Bio.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), several lines of evidence suggest that HSPGs may also act directly in the internalization of ligands. Lipoprotein lipase is anchored to the cell surface via HSPGs, through which it is internalized and recycled to intracellular compartments (35Saxena U. Klein M.G. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12880-12886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Herpes simplex virus does not bind to nor is internalized by cells harboring mutations in HSPG synthesis (36Shieh M.-T. WuDunn D. Montgomery R.I. Esko J.D. Spear P.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). While it is possible that the virus may bind to HSPGs initially and thereafter be transferred to another receptor that mediates infection, the observation that cell surface proteoglycans, especially those containing heparan sulfate, are rapidly internalized and degraded (37Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10270-10283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) argues for a direct role of the proteoglycans. Heparan sulfate moieties bind proteins predominantly via electrostatic interactions between the highly charged anionic sulfate groups and clusters of basic amino acid residues arranged in a three-dimensional array on the protein (31Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). TFPI may bind to cell surface HSPGs in a similar manner, since TFPI contains a stretch of basic residues at its C terminus (2Wun T.-C. Kretzmer K.K. Girard T.J. Miletich J.P. Broze Jr., G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6001-6004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), deletion of this C-terminal region abolishes binding of TFPI to the cell surface (23Warshawsky I. Bu G. Mast A. Saffitz J.E. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and a complementary reduction of HSPG sulfation in cells grown in chlorate-containing medium decreases the extent of TFPI binding (data not shown) and degradation (Fig. 2). Electrostatic interactions may render TFPI binding to a wide range of HSPGs expressed on cell surfaces. However, not all TFPI-bound HSPGs necessarily participate in the uptake and degradation of TFPI·fXa complexes. Whether the TFPI·fXa complex receptor is a specific core protein containing diverse GAG chains or a specific GAG on heterogeneous core proteins is a matter of future studies. It is interesting that among the cell lines tested, the endothelial cells (bend) exhibited >10-fold augmentation of fXa·TFPI uptake and degradation over the basal rate. The hepatoma cells (HepG2) and the fibroblasts (PEA 10) displayed 1.5-fold or less enhancement over the basal rates. Interestingly, the basal rate of TFPI degradation, which represents essentially the amount of TFPI degraded via LRP, was 15-fold lower in bend cells than in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6). These data suggest that bend cells express low levels of LRP, the endocytic receptor for uncomplexed TFPI (7Warshawsky I. Broze Jr., G.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but high levels of the endocytic receptor for TFPI·fXa complexes. Physiologically this may be important since a low rate of removal (uptake and degradation) of uncomplexed TFPI may be necessary to maintain high local concentrations of TFPI on vascular surfaces. Rapid turnover may be initiated as a means of clearance of fXa or the TFPI·fXa complex from the cell surface. Heparin has long been used clinically as an anticoagulant. In addition to direct inhibition of coagulation proteases, heparin greatly enhances the inhibitory activities of antithrombin III and TFPI. Anticoagulant heparan sulfate moieties on the vascular endothelial cell surfaces thus may endow them with non-thrombogenic properties (38Colburn P. Buonassisi V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 220-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Such anticoagulant HSPGs, which bind antithrombin III and greatly facilitate the inhibition to thrombin, have been isolated from rat fat pad microvascular endothelial cells (39Kojima T. Leone C.W. Marchildon G.A. Marcum J.A. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4859-4869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present study provides another potential anticoagulant role of cell surface HSPGs, one which directly involves TFPI and the active uptake and degradation of fXa·TFPI complexes generated on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2004854771,"The degradation of glucosylceramide in lysosomes is accomplished by glucosylceramidase with the assistance of, at least, another protein, saposin C (Sap C), which is generated from a large precursor together with three other similar proteins, saposins A, B, and D. In the present study, we have examined the effects of saposins on the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosylceramide inserted in large and small phospholipid liposomes. The glucosylceramide contained in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) was degraded by glucosylceramidase at a rate 7–8-fold lower than glucosylceramide inserted in small unilamellar vesicles (SUV). The separate addition of either Sap A or Sap C to the LUV system partially stimulated the sphingolipid degradation while saposins B and D had no effect. In the presence of both Sap A and Sap C, the rate of sphingolipid degradation was higher than the sum of the rates with the two saposins individually, indicating synergism in their actions. The stimulatory effect of the two saposins depended on the incorporation of an acidic phospholipid such as phosphatidylserine (PS) into LUV.The characteristics of glucosylceramidase activation by Sap C were different from those of Sap A. Sap C increased the rate of hydrolysis of both the artificial water soluble substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and the lipid substrate, glucosylceramide, while Sap A only stimulated degradation of the sphingolipid. Also the binding properties of Saps A and C were markedly different. At acidic pH values, Sap C bound to PS-containing LUV and promoted the association of glucosylceramidase with the membrane. In contrast, Sap A had poor affinity for the membrane even in the presence of glucosylceramide; moreover, Sap A did not potentiate the capacity of Sap C to mediate glucosylceramidase binding.In conclusion, our results show that both Sap A and Sap C are required for maximal hydrolysis of glucosylceramide inserted in PS-containing LUV, that their effects are synergistic, and that their mode of action is different. Sap C is responsible for the membrane binding of glucosylceramidase, while Sap A stimulation is possibly related to its effect on the conformation of the enzyme. It can be envisaged that Sap A in conjunction with Sap C might have a physiological role in glucosylceramide degradation. The degradation of glucosylceramide in lysosomes is accomplished by glucosylceramidase with the assistance of, at least, another protein, saposin C (Sap C), which is generated from a large precursor together with three other similar proteins, saposins A, B, and D. In the present study, we have examined the effects of saposins on the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosylceramide inserted in large and small phospholipid liposomes. The glucosylceramide contained in large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) was degraded by glucosylceramidase at a rate 7–8-fold lower than glucosylceramide inserted in small unilamellar vesicles (SUV). The separate addition of either Sap A or Sap C to the LUV system partially stimulated the sphingolipid degradation while saposins B and D had no effect. In the presence of both Sap A and Sap C, the rate of sphingolipid degradation was higher than the sum of the rates with the two saposins individually, indicating synergism in their actions. The stimulatory effect of the two saposins depended on the incorporation of an acidic phospholipid such as phosphatidylserine (PS) into LUV. The characteristics of glucosylceramidase activation by Sap C were different from those of Sap A. Sap C increased the rate of hydrolysis of both the artificial water soluble substrate, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and the lipid substrate, glucosylceramide, while Sap A only stimulated degradation of the sphingolipid. Also the binding properties of Saps A and C were markedly different. At acidic pH values, Sap C bound to PS-containing LUV and promoted the association of glucosylceramidase with the membrane. In contrast, Sap A had poor affinity for the membrane even in the presence of glucosylceramide; moreover, Sap A did not potentiate the capacity of Sap C to mediate glucosylceramidase binding. In conclusion, our results show that both Sap A and Sap C are required for maximal hydrolysis of glucosylceramide inserted in PS-containing LUV, that their effects are synergistic, and that their mode of action is different. Sap C is responsible for the membrane binding of glucosylceramidase, while Sap A stimulation is possibly related to its effect on the conformation of the enzyme. It can be envisaged that Sap A in conjunction with Sap C might have a physiological role in glucosylceramide degradation. Glucosylceramide is degraded in lysosomes by the concerted action of glucosylceramidase and, at least, another protein called saposin (Sap) 1The abbreviations used are: Sap, saposin; MU-Glc, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; chol, cholesterol; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. 1The abbreviations used are: Sap, saposin; MU-Glc, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; chol, cholesterol; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine.

Mutations affecting the coding region of Sap B caused a variant form of metachromatic leukodystrophy with storage of sulfatides (14Wenger D.A. De Gala G. Williams C. Taylor H.A. Stevenson R.E.

An isolated deficiency of either Sap A or D has not been reported so far, and thus the physiological consequences of the absence of one of these two saposins are unknown. To explore the role of Sap A, the effect of this saposin on the degradation of sphingolipids has been tested in vitro. It was reported that Sap A is able to increase substrate hydrolytic rates of glucosylceramidase and galactosylceramidase (16Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3389-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), an observation that prompted the authors to propose an involvement of Sap A in the metabolism of gluco- and galactosylceramides (16Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3389-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Another group claimed that Sap A was able to stimulate the glucosylceramidase activity at high concentrations (17Fabbro D. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15021-15027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) while at low physiological concentrations, it bound to glucosylceramidase without activating effects (18Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was thus considered unlikely that Sap A is an important activator of the enzyme. While the function of Sap A is still debated, that of Sap C as glucosylceramidase activator is well assessed (1O'Brien J. Kishimoto Y. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 2Kishimoto Y. Hiraiwa M. O'Brien J.S. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1255-1267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Furst W.

In vitro, the Sap C-induced stimulation of glucosylceramidase requires the presence of a negatively charged phospholipid such as phosphatidylserine (PS) (5Glew R.H. Basu A. La Marco K. Prence E. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 5-25PubMed Google Scholar, 19Basu A. Glew R.H. Daniels L.B. Clark L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1714-1719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In earlier studies, we provided evidence that Sap C was able to favor the association of glucosylceramidase with PS membranes and that the physical characteristics of PS vesicles markedly influenced their interaction with glucosylceramidase (20Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Barca A. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Most reports dealing with the reconstitution of glucosylceramidase activity by saposins have involved enzyme assays in which the substrate was an artificial water-soluble compound, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (MU-Glc) (17Fabbro D. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15021-15027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). When the characteristics of glucosylceramidase activity were investigated with the lipid substrate glucosylceramide inserted into sonicated small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), high activity was achieved upon addition of anionic phospholipids to the lipid bilayer (22Sarmientos F. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 160: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Gallozzi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1033: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The rate of glucosylceramide degradation depended on the binding of glucosylceramidase to SUV, and the presence of acidic phospholipids in the vesicles promoted enzyme binding even in the absence of saposins (23Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Gallozzi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1033: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Since at least Sap C is essential in vivo for the enzymatic degradation of glucosylceramide (13Christomanou H. Chabas A. Pampols T. Guardiola A. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the question arises whether small liposomes are a reliable membrane model for investigations on the involvement of saposins in sphingolipid hydrolysis. It is well known that the lipid packing in small vesicles is not optimal (24Nir S. Wilschut J. Bentz J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 688: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Ohki S. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 77: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar); the lipid surface disorder might facilitate the insertion of glucosylceramidase into the bilayer and obliterate the requirement for saposins. To have a better insight into the molecular mechanism of glucosylceramide degradation and the interactions involved, we have compared the characteristics of the hydrolysis of the sphingolipid inserted either in large or small vesicles. The effects of saposins on the catalytic process and their mode of action have been investigated. Glucosylceramide, purified from spleen of patients with Gaucher's disease, was labeled with tritium in the glucose moiety according to McMaster and Radin (26McMaster Jr., M.C. Radin N.S. J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. 1977; 13: 353-357Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) from egg yolk and PS from bovine brain were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL).l-α-dipalmitoyl [dipalmitoyl-1-14C]-PC (110 mCi/mmol) was from NEN Research Products, DuPont de Nemours (Germany). Cholesterol (chol) and MU-Glc were from Sigma. All other chemicals were of the purest available grade. Saps B, C, and D were purified from spleens of patients with Type 1 Gaucher's disease following a procedure previously reported (27Sano A. Radin N.S. Johnson L.L. Tarr G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19597-19601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it consisted of heat treatment of a water homogenate, ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel, gel filtration on Sephadex G-75, and reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on a protein C4 column (Vydac). Sap A, also from spleens of Gaucher's disease patients, was purified according to the procedure of Morimoto et al. (16Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3389-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The purity of the final saposin preparations was verified by N-terminal sequence analysis, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting. Antibodies against Saps A and C were raised in rabbits by injecting 200 μg of the individual saposins three times over a period of 2 months. Glucosylceramidase was purified from human placenta following the procedure described by Murray et al. (28Murray G.J. Youle R.J. Gandy S.E. Zirzow G.C. Barranger J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 147: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To measure the glucosylceramidase activity, either the water-soluble substrate, MU-Glc, or the lipid substrate, glucosylceramide, were utilized. In the first case, the assay mixture contained in a final volume of 0.1 ml: buffer A, pH 5.0 (10 mm acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), 2.5 mm MU-Glc, 3 ng of purified placental glucosylceramidase (about 9 units), 5 μg of albumin, and 100 μg of LUV without glucosylceramide (see below). The assay mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The extent of reaction was estimated fluorometrically as described previously (29Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In the second case, the assay mixture contained in a final volume of 0.1 ml: buffer A, pH 4.5 or pH 5.0, 3 ng of glucosylceramidase, 5 μg of albumin, and 100 μg of glucosylceramide-containing vesicles (see below). Glucosylceramide included in the liposomes was supplemented with the labeled compound to a specific activity of 3000 dpm/nmol. The assay mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The incubation was terminated by the addition of 0.4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and 50 μl of a 0.1% glucose solution. After shaking and centrifugation at 4000 rpm, the enzymatically released [3H]glucose present in the aqueous phase was estimated as described (23Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Gallozzi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1033: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In some cases also, a detergent assay has been utilized. It contained 0.1/0.2 m citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 5.6, 2.5 mm MU-Glc, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.25% (w/v) sodium taurocholate (21Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Barca A. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 1 unit of glucosylceramidase is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of MU-Glc/h in the detergent assay. LUV were prepared by filter exclusion using a high pressure extrusion apparatus (Lipex Biomembranes, Vancouver, Canada) as described previously (21Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Barca A. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 858: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). In short, the dry lipids were dispersed by Vortex mixing in 2 mml-histidine, 2 mm TES, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The suspension was submitted to 10 cycles of freezing and thawing and then extruded 15 times through two stacked 0.1-μm pore size polycarbonate filters (Nucleopore Corp., Pleasanton, CA). Four kinds of LUV were prepared: 1) LUV without glucosylceramide (chol:PC:PS, molar ratio 25:55:20); 2) LUV without glucosylceramide and without PS (chol:PC, molar ratio 25:75); 3) LUV with glucosylceramide but without PS (chol:PC:glucosylceramide, molar ratio 25:70:5); 4) LUV with glucosylceramide and PS (chol:PC:PS:glucosylceramide, molar ratio 25:50:20:5). The last lipid mixture was also utilized to prepare SUV by sonication (23Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Gallozzi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1033: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lipid suspension was sonicated under nitrogen in a Branson B15 Sonifier (3 min with a cup horn at a power setting of 100 watts, followed by 6 min with a microtip at a power setting of 100 watts). The preparation was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was used for the experiments. All vesicles were supplemented with trace amounts of labeled PC, and their concentration was determined by radioactivity measurements. For saposins binding studies, Sap A (10 μg) and Sap C (10 μg), separately or in combination, were incubated with LUV (100 μg total lipid) in 0.2 ml of buffer A adjusted to pH 4.5 at 37 °C for 15 min. The mixture was then centrifuged with a 42.2 Ti rotor (Beckman) in polycarbonate centrifuge tubes (7 × 20 mm) at 80,000 × g for 1 h. More than 95% of vesicles were found in the pellet as determined by radioactivity measurements. Conversely, in control experiments without liposomes, the saposins were found not to sediment during the ultracentrifugation. After separation of the supernatant, the pelletted vesicles were rinsed once with 0.2 ml of buffer A and finally resuspended in 0.2 ml of the same buffer. Saposins in the initial supernatant (free saposins) and in the resuspended vesicles (liposome-bound saposins) were precipitated by addition of 20 μg of albumin and 2 ml of cold acetone. After 2 h at −20 °C, the precipitated saposins were collected by centrifugation, solubilized with 30 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer and identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (see below). For glucosylceramidase binding studies, the enzyme (1000 units) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with LUV (100 μg total lipid), and the indicated amounts of saposins in 0.2 ml of buffer A, pH 4.5, were added with 10 mm dithioerythritol and 20 μg of albumin. The mixture was centrifuged as above. The amount of glucosylceramidase in the supernatant was determined by measuring the enzyme activity according to the detergent assay (see above). The amount of liposome-bound glucosylceramidase was expressed relative to the amount of enzyme in the supernatant of a sample centrifuged in the absence of liposomes. A discontinuous Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis system was performed with 16.5% acrylamide (31Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10460) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the saposins were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and detected with antibodies against each saposin using a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer instructions. Antibodies raised against Sap A did not cross-react with Sap C and vice versa. We have previously shown that PS LUV, as opposed to PS SUV, are unable to fully stimulate glucosylceramidase activity toward the artificial substrate MU-Glc (21Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Barca A. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we have investigated whether the liposome size has a similar effect on the enzyme activity toward glucosylceramide, the physiological enzyme substrate, inserted in vesicles containing, besides glucosylceramide (5%), cholesterol, PC, and an acidic phospholipid such as PS. Large and small liposomes of identical composition were utilized. As shown in Fig.1, glucosylceramidase at acidic pH values was able to efficiently degrade the sphingolipid contained in SUV but not that in LUV; glucosylceramidase activity measured with the LUV system was only 10–15% of the activity measured with the SUV system. This same pattern was observed when the percentage of the sphingolipid in the bilayer was increased from 5 to 10% (data not shown). To reduce changes in the surface of the phospholipid vesicles, the lower glucosylceramide concentration was utilized for further investigations. The ability of the four saposins to promote the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide in LUV was next investigated (Fig.2 A). Sap C and Sap A increased the degradation rate of the sphingolipid while Saps B and D had no effect. Despite the stimulation induced by either Sap A or Sap C, the hydrolysis rate of glucosylceramide inserted in LUV was still considerably lower than that achieved with the SUV system. To explore the possibility of an additive or synergistic effect, Sap A and Sap C were simultaneously added to the enzymatic assay. As shown in Fig.2 B, Sap A caused an additional increase of the hydrolysis rate over that obtained with 5 μm Sap C and vice versa, the total stimulation being higher than the sum of the single effects of the two saposins.Figure 2Effect of saposins on the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosylceramide inserted in LUV. Glucosylceramidase was incubated with glucosylceramide-containing LUV in buffer A adjusted to pH 4.5. The composition of LUV and the enzymatic assay were as in Fig. 1. A, increasing amounts of either Sap A (□—□), Sap B (▵—▵), Sap C (○—○), or Sap D (▿—▿) were added to the assay. B, the enzyme assay contained a fixed amount of Sap A (5 μm), increasing amounts of Sap C (▪—▪), or a fixed amount of Sap C (5 μm) and increasing amounts of Sap A (•—•). The points represent means of at least three different experiments. The deviation for all samples was less than ± 5% of the corresponding mean value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then investigated whether Sap A and Sap C could further increase the high degradation rate of glucosylceramide inserted in PS-containing SUV. As shown in Fig. 3 A, in this system, the two saposins also stimulated enzyme activity (about 30% activation). In the LUV system, the stimulatory effects, and especially the synergism of Sap A and Sap C in the admixture, were much more evident (700–800% activation). The optimum pH for the sphingolipid degradation was the same both in the presence and in the absence of saposins, namely pH 5.0 for the SUV system and pH 4.5 for the LUV system. To check the importance of PS for glucosylceramidase stimulation by Sap A and Sap C, the enzyme assays were repeated utilizing glucosylceramide-containing LUV devoid of PS. Under these conditions, the enzyme activity decreased dramatically, even in the presence of both saposins (Fig. 3 A). The effect of Sap A on the glucosylceramide hydrolysis observed in this paper was unexpected; in fact, we had previously found that the hydrolysis of the water-soluble enzyme substrate, MU-Glc, was unaffected by Sap A (32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B confirms that, in the presence of PS-containing LUV, Sap A poorly activates the MU-Glc hydrolysis. The enzyme activity toward this substrate is fully stimulated by Sap C, independently of Sap A. It is thus evident that the Sap A stimulation is specific for glucosylceramide hydrolysis. We recently found that Sap A, as opposed to Sap C, fails to bind tightly to phospholipid membranes (32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Since Sap A, especially in combination with Sap C, is able to promote the degradation of glucosylceramide inserted in LUV, we considered the possibility that the sphingolipid and/or Sap C could increase the affinity of Sap A for the lipid surface. Sap A, either alone or in admixture with Sap C, was thus incubated with PS-containing LUV with or without glucosylceramide; the LUV-associated saposins were then separated from nonbound saposins by ultracentrifugation. The identity of the saposins present in the supernatant and in the pellet was evaluated by immunoblotting with specific anti-Sap A or anti-Sap C antibodies. Fig. 4shows that Sap A poorly associates with the vesicles (comparelanes 2 and 4 with lanes 3 and5), even in the presence of glucosylceramide (Fig.4 A) and Sap C. Centrifugation separated the two combined proteins; most of Sap A was recovered in the supernatant while most of Sap C was bound to the vesicles either in the presence or in the absence of the sphingolipid (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 5). These results clearly show that the binding properties of Sap A and Sap C are quite different, irrespective of whether the phospholipid membranes contain glucosylceramide. We had previously observed that Sap A is unable to promote the binding of glucosylceramidase to LUV composed of cholesterol, PC, and PS (32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We have now investigated whether Sap A could at least potentiate the Sap C capacity to mediate the glucosylceramidase association with PS-containing membranes. As shown in Table I, at pH 4.5 (the optimum for enzyme activity in the LUV system), only a minor percentage (10%) of glucosylceramidase is bound to the bilayer when saposins are omitted. Consistent with our earlier observations (32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), Sap C is able to promote the extensive enzyme association with LUV. The further addition of Sap A does not increase the adsorption of glucosylceramidase, even at suboptimal Sap C concentrations. In conclusion, Sap C is the only saposin responsible for the enzyme interaction with membranes.Table IEffect of Saps A and C on the binding of glucosylceramidase to phospholipid LUVAdditionBound glucosylceramidase%LUV (chol:PC:PS)10 ± 31-aMean ± S.D. of at least four determinations. +Sap A (0.2 μM)10 ± 3 +Sap C (0.2 μM)30 ± 5 +Sap C (0.2 μM) +Sap A (0.2 μM)30 ± 6 +Sap A (5 μM)15 ± 3 +Sap C (5 μM)70 ± 8 +Sap C (5 μM) +Sap A (5 μM)65 ± 7LUV (chol:PC)5 ± 3 +Sap A, (5 μM)5 ± 4 +Sap C, (5 μM)5 ± 3 +Sap C, (5 μM) +Sap A, (5 μM)10 ± 5Glucosylceramidase was incubated with LUV with and without PS in buffer A, pH 4.5, in the absence or in the presence of Sap A and Sap C, as indicated.

Open table in a new tab Glucosylceramidase was incubated with LUV with and without PS in buffer A, pH 4.5, in the absence or in the presence of Sap A and Sap C, as indicated. The percentage of glucosylceramidase bound to liposomes was measured as reported under “Experimental Procedures.” It was confirmed that the presence of an acidic phospholipid in the bilayer is essential for enzyme binding; Sap C, either alone or in combination with Sap A, is unable to promote a tight association of the enzyme with liposomes devoid of PS (Table I). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the involvement of saposins in the enzymatic degradation of glucosylceramide and to consider the mechanism whereby saposins and lipids may modulate glucosylceramidase activity toward its natural substrate. Glucosylceramide was inserted in LUV having the lipid composition estimated to be characteristic of most membranes, namely containing cholesterol and phospholipids (1:3). In many biological studies, the average size of the liposomes used as the model of biological membranes is a critical parameter for the interpretation of the results. In the present research, we have found that glucosylceramide can be degraded more efficiently when inserted in PS-containing SUV rather than in PS-containing LUV. This result stresses the importance of the assay system chosen for the study of glucosylceramidase activity and properties. The different performance of the LUV and SUV systems can only be explained on the basis of lipid organization. In fact, there were no compositional differences between vesicles. Probably, the loose packing of the lipids in the outer surface of small vesicles favors the enzyme interaction with glucosylceramide. The influence of the bilayer curvature on glucosylceramidase activity might have a physiological relevance also on consideration that cerebrosides, such as the glucosylceramide substrate, are possibly involved in the formation and maintenance of highly curved membranes (33Curatolo W. Neuringer L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17177-17182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When glucosylceramide is contained in LUV, where the lipid packing arrangement approaches that of a planar bilayer, glucosylceramidase poorly interacts with its natural substrate unless two saposins, Sap C and A, are added to the liposomal system. Each of the two saposins by itself has a partial effect; only in admixture do they increase the rate of glucosylceramide hydrolysis up to a level comparable with that observed in the SUV system. The combined effects of the two saposins were always greater than the sum of the stimulation induced by the two saposins separately. Such synergism suggests a different mode of action of Saps A and C. The idea that the two saposins act through different mechanisms is strongly supported by their distinct effects on the glucosylceramidase activity toward two substrates; Sap A stimulates the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide, but not that of the artificial substrate MU-Glc, while Sap C stimulates the hydrolysis of MU-Glc more than that of glucosylceramide. We previously showed that Sap C has the greatest membrane affinity of the four saposins (32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An acid-induced increased hydrophobicity has been demonstrated as the first step in the Sap C association with membranes (32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After interaction with Sap C, PS-containing LUV acquire the capacity to bind glucosylceramidase (20Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The present observation that the Sap C-mediated adhesion of glucosylceramidase to lipid bilayers results in only a partial stimulation of glucosylceramide hydrolysis indicates that additional factors are required for an optimal interaction between the enzyme and its lipid substrate. The presence of Sap A appears to fulfill this requirement. Differently from Sap C, Sap A binds poorly to bilayers (present work, and Ref. 32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In parallel, Sap A neither has a significant effect by itself on the interaction of the enzyme with membranes nor potentiates the Sap C capacity to promote this interaction. To explain the stimulation of glucosylceramide hydrolysis by Sap A, a mechanism different from that of Sap C can be envisaged. As proposed by other groups (16Morimoto S. Martin B.M. Yamamoto Y. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S Kishimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3389-3393Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 17Fabbro D. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15021-15027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Sap A might form a complex with glucosylceramidase, causing a conformational change in the structure of the enzyme that results in increased catalysis. In this context, the role of Sap A would be mainly related to the enzyme-glucosylceramide interaction while that of Sap C to the membrane localization of the enzyme. In general, the activity of membrane-bound enzymes, such as glucosylceramidase, is modulated by their lipid environment. Glucosylceramidase has a strong affinity for acidic phospholipids such as PS (5Glew R.H. Basu A. La Marco K. Prence E. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 5-25PubMed Google Scholar); these lipids are essential for the binding of glucosylceramidase to liposomes (23Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Ciaffoni F. Gallozzi E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1033: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and for the reconstitution of the enzyme activity either in the presence or absence of saposins (present paper, and Refs. 5Glew R.H. Basu A. La Marco K. Prence E. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 5-25PubMed Google Scholar and 20Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Maras B. Barca A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of PS markedly increases also the extent of Sap C binding and the consequent perturbation of the bilayer structure (32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus, the Sap C stimulation of glucosylceramidase is possibly related to the Sap C-induced destabilization of membranes, which might favor the interaction of the enzyme with PS. Our past (29Vaccaro A.M. Tatti M. Ciaffoni F. Salvioli R. Roncaioli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1119: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 32Vaccaro A.M. Ciaffoni F. Tatti M. Salvioli R. Barca A. Tognozzi D. Scerch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30576-30580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and present results suggest that a change in PS content might regulate the amount of Sap C and glucosylceramidase in lysosomal membranes, allowing acidic phospholipids to have a dynamic function in the glucosylceramide degradation. In contrast with our findings, some authors have claimed that Sap C does not interact with acidic phospholipids and that this saposin stimulates glucosylceramidase by binding directly to the enzyme (34Morimoto S. Kishimoto Y. Tomich J. Weiler S. Ohashi T. Barranger J.A. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1933-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two groups who previously tested the effect of the simultaneous addition of Saps A and C on the glucosylceramidase activity utilized MU-Glc but not glucosylceramide as substrate; under these conditions, they found that Sap A, although being able by itself to activate glucosylceramidase, had no additive effect over the optimal catalytic rate achieved by saturating amounts of Sap C (18Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Morimoto S. Kishimoto Y. Tomich J. Weiler S. Ohashi T. Barranger J.A. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1933-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The authors concluded that Sap A and Sap C have the same mode of action and that the two saposins compete for a binding site on glucosylceramidase (18Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Morimoto S. Kishimoto Y. Tomich J. Weiler S. Ohashi T. Barranger J.A. Kretz K.A. O'Brien J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1933-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our experience, it is critically important to use appropriate conditions for testing the effects of saposins. We could evidence the additivity of the Sap A and Sap C effects only when the degradation of glucosylceramide was measured (see Fig. 3). We did not observe any Sap A stimulation of the MU-Glc hydrolysis, a finding in agreement with Kondoh et al. (35Kondoh K. Hineno T. Sano A. Kakimoto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 181: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When Sap C is absent in consequence of a genetic defect, the accumulation of intralysosomal glucosylceramide and a Gaucher-like disease have been observed (13Christomanou H. Chabas A. Pampols T. Guardiola A. Klin. Wochenschr. 1989; 67: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In this variant of Gaucher's disease, glucosylceramidase and Sap A are present at almost normal levels. For authors who believe that Sap A and Sap C act through the same mechanism, this observation argues against a possible physiological function of Sap A as a glucosylceramidase activator (18Qi X. Leonova T. Grabowski G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16746-16753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Theoretically, if the two saposins have similar properties, a normal Sap A might accomplish the function of a deficient Sap C. By contrast, if the two saposins have different mechanisms of action, as our results indicate, the glucosylceramide accumulation caused by the absence of Sap C might not be prevented by the presence of Sap A. In conclusion, our work provides new information regarding the influence of saposins on glucosylceramide degradation. According to our findings, glucosylceramidase activity toward its lipid substrate can be modulated by several factors, the more important being the presence of two saposins, Sap C and Sap A, and the membrane structure and composition. The fact that Sap A and Sap C can synergistically affect glucosylceramide hydrolysis suggests the possibility that saposins might accomplish their physiological function not only as single proteins but also in conjunction with each other.

Molecular modeling suggests that the protein contains about 30 transmembrane β-strands connected by loop regions. One of these external loops, extending from residue 316 to 356, is involved in ligand binding (2Carmel G. Coulton J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4394-4403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Killmann H.

Sedimentation data combined with size exclusion chromatography indicated that the protein is monomeric. It is characterized by a high (51%) β-sheet content and the absence of α-helical structure. The purified protein solubilized in OG is functional as demonstrated by its capacity to bind phage T5 and to trigger the release of the DNA in the external medium (6Boulanger P. Le Maire M. Bonhivers M. Dubois S. Desmadril M. Letellier L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14216-14224Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Binding of phage T5 to purified FhuA incorporated into planar lipid bilayers also converts the transporter into an ion channel. It was proposed that the function of this channel would be to trigger the diffusion of ferrichrome and of phage DNA (7Bonhivers M. Ghazi A. Boulanger P. Letellier L. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1850-1856Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Phage T5 DNA is a double-stranded molecule of 121 kilobase pairs, 30 μm in length. Despite many attempts (8Letellier L. Boulanger P. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1989; 71: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Boulanger P. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3168-3172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Guihard G. Boulanger P. Letellier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3173-3178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism by which the DNA of this and other phage is transferred through the bacterial envelope remains an open question. Since it is difficult to obtain information at the molecular level in vivo, we have tried to analyze at least part of this process in vitro. Indeed, if as proposed above, the FhuA channel allows the passage of the phage DNA, and if no other bacterial components are required, we expect the reconstitution of FhuA into liposomes to trigger transfer of the phage genome inside the vesicle. Early experiments suggested that some DNA might be transferred into liposomes bearing the partially purified phage T5 receptor (11Tosi F. Labedan B. Legault-Demare J. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these liposomes were small (<100 nm) and appeared collapsed and multilayered, which raised the question of how the DNA could pass through this multiple membrane barrier. Roessner et al. (12Roessner C. Struck D. Ihler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 643-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also claimed that phage λ DNA would be injected into small unilamellar vesicles (75–100 nm in diameter) containing the LamB receptor.We report the reconstitution of FhuA into large unilamellar vesicles. The morphology of the proteoliposomes was analyzed by FFEM. We show that FhuA is symmetrically oriented in the vesicles and functional as its interaction with phage T5 triggers the release of DNA and its transfer into the proteoliposomes.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this paper indicate that FhuA can be functionally reconstituted into liposomes. Two reconstitution protocols were chosen because they were likely to result in different orientations of the protein in the liposomes. Reconstitution of FhuA was less efficient when the protein was added to liposomes saturated with detergent coexisting with mixed lipid/detergent micelles (stage II); few proteins were inserted into the liposomes, and large protein aggregates that were not incorporated into the liposomes were found. It is likely that upon removal of the detergent, aggregation of the protein has preceded insertion in the liposomes and that the only proteoliposomes formed originate from mixed detergent/lipid micelles. In contrast, when reconstitution was performed at stage III,i.e. from totally solubilized liposomes, neither protein aggregates nor multilamellar vesicles were found, and large proteoliposomes (mean diameter ranging from 100 to 200 nm, some of them having a diameter of 500–800 nm) were observed which contained fairly large amounts of proteins. The fact that the proteoliposomes were larger than the initial liposome preparation suggests that the protein incorporates into the liposomes during their formation and that the open vesicles tend to fuse and form large vesicles. The difference in size of the vesicles formed upon reconstitution at stage II or III is probably due to the rate of removal of detergent, which is in turn dependent on the initial detergent/lipid ratio and on detergent concentration (23Levy D. Bluzat A. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Functionality of reconstituted FhuA was assessed from a fluorescence assay of the DNA released upon binding of phage T5. Interaction of T5 with proteoliposomes prepared at stage II resulted in some release of DNA (data not shown). However, the preparation also contained protein aggregates, making it difficult to discriminate between phage bound to the aggregates or to proteoliposomes. For the different reasons given above proteoliposomes prepared at stage III were more suitable for functional assays. The protein was shown to be symmetrically oriented in these liposomes. DNA released from the phage was found both outside and inside the proteoliposomes. The DNA present outside is likely to originate from aberrant phage. These phages eject their DNA outside the bacterial envelope and represent 10–30% of the T5 stocks (24Labedan B. Legault-Demare J. J. Virol. 1974; 13: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA might also be mistargeted as a consequence of inappropriate interactions between the phage and the receptor. This could occur in vesicles having a small curvature radius. We are rather confident that our measurements have allowed us to determine entrapped DNA and not that released upon solubilization of the liposomes since binding to any newly accessible receptor was prevented by the addition of ferrichrome. Such a precaution was not taken by Tosi et al. (11Tosi F. Labedan B. Legault-Demare J. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore rendering their data on T5 DNA transfer in liposomes difficult to interpret. Similarly, Roessner et al. (12Roessner C. Struck D. Ihler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 643-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) measured injection of phage λ DNA into small unilamellar vesicles containing the LamB receptor after disruption of the liposomes with chloroform or phospholipase followed by DNase treatment. We cannot exclude that this treatment has unmasked inside-oriented receptors to which phage λ would have bound. Our experiments strongly suggest that no bacterial component other than FhuA is required for DNA transport. They however indicate that only 10–20% of the total phage DNA is transferred into the liposomes. The simplest explanation is that transfer takes place only in the largest (500–800 nm in diameter) liposomes, which represent only a small part of the population. The state of compaction of T5 DNA in the liposomes is not known. We cannot exclude that polyamines present in the phage capsid would be transferred along with the DNA into the liposomes. Phage λ DNA (49 kilobase pairs) compacted with polyamines appears as a sphere of less than 100 nm in diameter in electron microscopy (25Chattoraj D. Gosule L. Schellman J. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). If T5 DNA is also compacted by polyamines then it could fit into the proteoliposomes. The route used by DNA to cross the liposomes also remains unknown. DNA transfer is accompanied neither by significant perturbations of the vesicles morphology nor by changes in permeability to solutes of high molecular mass (i.e. cytochrome c) (26ôme d'Etudes Approfondies, Université Paris Sud, OrsayPlançon, L. (1996) Diplôme d'Etudes Approfondies, Université Paris Sud, Orsay.Google Scholar). The simplest model therefore still supposes that the DNA diffuses through the channel opened by T5 in FhuA. FhuA is a 78.9-kDa Escherichia coli outer membrane protein that catalyzes the high affinity transport of the ferric siderophores ferrichrome and albomycin across this membrane. It is also the receptor for bacteriophage T1, T5, and Φ80 and for colicin M (for review, see Ref. 1Braun V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 16: 295-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar).

Virol. 1984; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these liposomes were small (<100 nm) and appeared collapsed and multilayered, which raised the question of how the DNA could pass through this multiple membrane barrier. Roessner et al. (12Roessner C. Struck D. Ihler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 643-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also claimed that phage λ DNA would be injected into small unilamellar vesicles (75–100 nm in diameter) containing the LamB receptor. We report the reconstitution of FhuA into large unilamellar vesicles. The morphology of the proteoliposomes was analyzed by FFEM. We show that FhuA is symmetrically oriented in the vesicles and functional as its interaction with phage T5 triggers the release of DNA and its transfer into the proteoliposomes. DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this paper indicate that FhuA can be functionally reconstituted into liposomes. Two reconstitution protocols were chosen because they were likely to result in different orientations of the protein in the liposomes. Reconstitution of FhuA was less efficient when the protein was added to liposomes saturated with detergent coexisting with mixed lipid/detergent micelles (stage II); few proteins were inserted into the liposomes, and large protein aggregates that were not incorporated into the liposomes were found. It is likely that upon removal of the detergent, aggregation of the protein has preceded insertion in the liposomes and that the only proteoliposomes formed originate from mixed detergent/lipid micelles. In contrast, when reconstitution was performed at stage III,i.e. from totally solubilized liposomes, neither protein aggregates nor multilamellar vesicles were found, and large proteoliposomes (mean diameter ranging from 100 to 200 nm, some of them having a diameter of 500–800 nm) were observed which contained fairly large amounts of proteins. The fact that the proteoliposomes were larger than the initial liposome preparation suggests that the protein incorporates into the liposomes during their formation and that the open vesicles tend to fuse and form large vesicles. The difference in size of the vesicles formed upon reconstitution at stage II or III is probably due to the rate of removal of detergent, which is in turn dependent on the initial detergent/lipid ratio and on detergent concentration (23Levy D. Bluzat A. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1025: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Functionality of reconstituted FhuA was assessed from a fluorescence assay of the DNA released upon binding of phage T5. Interaction of T5 with proteoliposomes prepared at stage II resulted in some release of DNA (data not shown). However, the preparation also contained protein aggregates, making it difficult to discriminate between phage bound to the aggregates or to proteoliposomes. For the different reasons given above proteoliposomes prepared at stage III were more suitable for functional assays. The protein was shown to be symmetrically oriented in these liposomes. DNA released from the phage was found both outside and inside the proteoliposomes. The DNA present outside is likely to originate from aberrant phage. These phages eject their DNA outside the bacterial envelope and represent 10–30% of the T5 stocks (24Labedan B. Legault-Demare J. J. Virol. 1974; 13: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA might also be mistargeted as a consequence of inappropriate interactions between the phage and the receptor. This could occur in vesicles having a small curvature radius. We are rather confident that our measurements have allowed us to determine entrapped DNA and not that released upon solubilization of the liposomes since binding to any newly accessible receptor was prevented by the addition of ferrichrome. Such a precaution was not taken by Tosi et al. (11Tosi F. Labedan B. Legault-Demare J. J. Virol. 1984; 50: 213-219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), therefore rendering their data on T5 DNA transfer in liposomes difficult to interpret. Similarly, Roessner et al. (12Roessner C. Struck D. Ihler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 643-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) measured injection of phage λ DNA into small unilamellar vesicles containing the LamB receptor after disruption of the liposomes with chloroform or phospholipase followed by DNase treatment. We cannot exclude that this treatment has unmasked inside-oriented receptors to which phage λ would have bound. Our experiments strongly suggest that no bacterial component other than FhuA is required for DNA transport. They however indicate that only 10–20% of the total phage DNA is transferred into the liposomes. The simplest explanation is that transfer takes place only in the largest (500–800 nm in diameter) liposomes, which represent only a small part of the population. The state of compaction of T5 DNA in the liposomes is not known. We cannot exclude that polyamines present in the phage capsid would be transferred along with the DNA into the liposomes. Phage λ DNA (49 kilobase pairs) compacted with polyamines appears as a sphere of less than 100 nm in diameter in electron microscopy (25Chattoraj D. Gosule L. Schellman J. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). If T5 DNA is also compacted by polyamines then it could fit into the proteoliposomes. The route used by DNA to cross the liposomes also remains unknown. DNA transfer is accompanied neither by significant perturbations of the vesicles morphology nor by changes in permeability to solutes of high molecular mass (i.e. cytochrome c) (26ôme d'Etudes Approfondies, Université Paris Sud, OrsayPlançon, L. (1996) Diplôme d'Etudes Approfondies, Université Paris Sud, Orsay.Google Scholar). The simplest model therefore still supposes that the DNA diffuses through the channel opened by T5 in FhuA.

https://openalex.org/W2014251406,"SNAREs (soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion proteinattachment protein receptors) are cytoplasmically oriented membrane proteins that reside on vesicular carriers (v-SNARE) and target organelles (t-SNARE). The pairing of a stage-specific v-SNARE with its cognate t-SNARE may mediate the specificity of membrane traffic. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex employs two v-SNAREs, Bos1p and Sec22p, each containing a domain that is related to the neuronal v-SNARE synaptobrevin. Sed5p, which is homologous to syntaxin, is the t-SNARE that functions at this stage of the secretory pathway. Here we report that regions of Bos1p and Sec22p, which are homologous to synaptobrevin, bind to the syntaxin-like domain of Sed5p. Furthermore, we demonstrate that efficient v-SNARE/t-SNARE interactions require the participation of both v-SNAREs, indicating that, unlike post-Golgi membrane traffic, the active form of the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi v-SNARE is a heteromeric complex.

The secretory pathway is composed of several distinct membrane-bound compartments, each with a unique set of proteins. The maintenance of these organelles is governed by the proper targeting of vesicular carriers that move to and from these compartments. For example, to maintain its integrity, the cis-Golgi complex must receive anterograde transport vesicles that originate from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SNARE, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptor; v, vesicular; t, target; GST, glutathione S-transferase. or retrograde vesicles that bud from later Golgi compartments. How does a vesicular carrier find its acceptor membrane? The SNARE hypothesis (1Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar) states that each vesicle contains a specific membrane protein (v-SNARE) which recognizes a unique receptor that resides on the target organelle (t-SNARE). Pairing of a v-SNARE with its cognate t-SNARE ensures that a vesicle will dock and fuse with its appropriate target membrane. SNAREs have distinct features. Besides their vesicular localization, v-SNAREs are cytoplasmically oriented transmembrane proteins that are homologous to the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin. t-SNAREs, on the other hand, are homologous to one of two neuronal presynaptic membrane proteins, syntaxin or SNAP-25. The yeast gene productsBOS1 (2Shim J. Newman A.P. Ferro-Novick S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and SEC22 (3Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), which are constituents of the ER to Golgi transport vesicles, fit the criteria of v-SNAREs. Their putative receptor is the t-SNARE Sed5p, a type II transmembrane Golgi protein that is related to syntaxin (4Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Bet1p, which contains a domain that is related to SNAP-25, resides primarily on the ER instead of the target membrane (5Newman A.P. Groesch M.E. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3609-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol.

Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Included in this complex are the v-SNAREs Bos1p and Sec22p, the t-SNARE Sed5p, small amounts of Bet1p, and six other proteins (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar, 7Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In vitrobinding studies have demonstrated that the essential v-SNARE Bos1p binds directly to Sed5p, and Bet1p potentiates this interaction (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar). The role of the nonessential v-SNARE, Sec22p, is discussed in this report. Although Bos1p and Sec22p colocalize to the ER and carrier vesicles, they only form a complex on ER-derived transport vesicles where Bos1p functions (8Lian J.P. Ferro-Novick S. Cell. 1993; 73: 735-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Lian J.P. Stone S. Jiang Y. Lyons P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1994; 372: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Here we performed in vitro binding studies to demonstrate directly that the pairing of these proteins modulates the activity of the v-SNARE. Furthermore, deletion analysis revealed that a domain of Sed5p which is highly homologous to syntaxin binds to the synaptobrevin-like regions of Bos1p and Sec22p. Yeast strains used in this study were: SFNY26-6A (MATα, his4–619), ANY112 (MAT a, bet1–1, ura3–52), SFNY411 (MATα, sec22–3, ura3–52,ade2–801, leu2-Δ98), SFNY412 (MAT a, bos1–1, ura3–52,leu2–3, 112), SFNY357 (MATα, ura3–52,leu2–3, 112, SEC22::URA3), SFNY358 (MAT a, ura3–52, leu2–3, 112), SFNY82 (Mat a/α, leu2–3,112/leu2–3, 112,ura3–52/ura3–52,BET1::LEU2), SFNY571 (MATα, sed5–1, ura3–52, leu2–3, 112, his3-Δ200, trp1-Δ901, lys2–801, suc2-Δ9), and NY426 (MAT a, ura3–52,sec22–3). Tetrad analysis and yeast transformations were performed as described before (10Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). All molecular biology reagents were from New England BioLabs except for Taq DNA polymerase, which was from Boehringer Mannheim. The sec22–3 mutant was sequenced by subcloning the SEC22 gene into the yeast shuttle vector pRS316 (URA3, CEN6; Ref. 11Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The open reading frame was excised with AatII and BsgI, and the resulting linearized DNA was transformed into SFNY411 to allow for repair of the gapped gene (12Orr-Weaver T.L. Szostak J.W. Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 228-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was rescued and sequenced to identify the site of the mutation. The cytoplasmic domains of Bet1p, Bos1p, and Sec22p were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the appropriate primers as described before (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar). Additional oligonucleotides used for polymerase chain reaction in this study were as follows: 3′ oligonucleotide for His6-Bos1p(1–150): 5′-ATACTAGGATCCCTGCGGTAGTCCCCCACCGTTGC-3′ 3′ oligonucleotide for His6-Bos1p(1–135): 5′-ATACTAGGATCCCTAACCACCAACGTTCCTTTTATTC-3′ 5′ oligonucleotide for His6-Sec22p(41–194): 5′-ATACTACATATGTTGACACCACAGTCTGCCACG-3′ 3′ oligonucleotide for His6-Sec22p(1–154); 5′-ATACTACTCGAGTAGGTCTTCGATGTTCTTGG-3′. His6-Bos1p(1–150) and His6-Bos1p(1–135) were ligated into the NcoI/BamHI site of pET11d (Novagen). His6-Sec22p(41–194) and His6-Sec22p(1–154) were ligated into theNdeI/XhoI site of pET29a (Novagen). GST fusions of the cytoplasmic domains of Bos1p, Bos1p(L190S), and Sed5p were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in-frame at the BamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX-5X-3 (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar); Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Additional oligonucleotides used in this study were: 3′ oligonucleotide for Bos1p(1–170)-GST: 5′-ATACTACTCGAGCTAATCTAATTGAGCGTTACCCCTTTC-3′ 3′ oligonucleotide for Sed5p(1–250)-GST: 5′-ATACTACTCGAGTTAGTAGACGTTATTGGATAACTG-3′ 5′ oligonucleotide for Sed5p(158–324)-GST: 5′-ATACTAGGATCCCCAAAGACGTATTGGAGGAAAGGC-3′ 5′ oligonucleotide for Sed5p(251–324)-GST: 5′-ATACTAGGATCCCCTTACAAGAAAGAAATAGGGCGG-3′. Bos1p(1–170)-GST was ligated into the BamHI site of pGEX-5X-3 (Pharmacia). All Sed5p-GST truncations were ligated into theBamHI/XhoI site of pGEX-5X-3. His6(6-histidine)-tagged proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Novagen) as described by the manufacturer except the tagged protein was eluted with 800 mm imidazole in 1-ml fractions. Fractions containing the peak of eluted protein were dialyzed against binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 25 mmNaCl, 115 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2) containing 30% glycerol. GST fusion proteins were purified by a batchwise procedure and eluted using 25 mm glutathione. The fusion protein was dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline (154 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.7 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.5), and the concentration was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). The protein that failed to rebind to the resin was estimated, and the amount that bound to the beads was determined as the difference in values obtained before and after rebinding. Beads were stored at 4 °C in the presence of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The purity of each protein was determined by amino-terminal sequence analysis, and all concentrations reported take into account the percent purity. In vitro binding assays were performed by incubating varying amounts of His6-tagged proteins with 1 μm GST fusion protein (immobilized on beads) in a 100-μl reaction containing binding buffer (see above) and 0.5% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C, and the beads were washed four times with binding buffer. The bound His6-tagged protein was eluted in SDS-sample buffer and electrophoresed on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-Bos1p (1:1,500 dilution) or anti-Sec22p (1:1,250 dilution) antiserum using 125I-protein A. Truncated forms of Bos1p and Sec22p were tested to ensure immunoreactivity with their respective antiserum. To determine the amount of His6-tagged fusion protein bound to the beads, samples were compared with standards of the appropriate recombinant protein (either His6-Bos1p or His6-Sec22p) and, following immunodetection, exposed to a PhosphorImaging plate and scanned onto a PhosphorImager. The Bos1p and Sec22p standard curves were linear in the range used (0–250 ng of protein). Antisera to Bos1p and Sec22p were raised against cytoplasmic domains of these proteins tagged with six histidine residues to facilitate antigen purification. Wild type yeast (SFNY26-6A) were grown to an OD599 = 1.0 and converted to spheroplasts during a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. The spheroplasts were lysed in 1% SDS (0.14 OD599 units/μl) and heated to 100 °C. The protein concentration of the lysate was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Quantitative immunoblotting was performed on known amounts of lysate with an anti-Bos1p (1:1,500) or anti-Sec22p antiserum (1:1,250), and His6-Bos1p or His6-Sec22p (prepared as described above) were used to establish the standard curve. Western blotting was performed using 125I-protein A. The blots were exposed to a PhosphorImaging plate, scanned onto a PhosphorImager, and analyzed with Molecular Dynamics Image Quant software (version 3.15). Cells disrupted for the SEC22 gene display no growth defect at 30 °C but are cold-sensitive and temperature-sensitive for growth. This conditional lethal growth defect is suppressed by the overexpression ofBET1 or BOS1 (3Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 9Lian J.P. Stone S. Jiang Y. Lyons P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1994; 372: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), indicating that an increase in either gene product partially compensates for the loss of Sec22p. Previous studies have shown that Bet1p enables Bos1p to interact more efficiently with Sed5p (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar). If Bet1p and Sec22p have related functions, then Sec22p may also play a role in facilitating the activity of Bos1p. To begin to address the function of Sec22p, we performed in vitro binding studies. These studies were executed by fusing the cytoplasmic portion of Sec22p to a six-histidine tag (His6-Sec22p) and then testing its ability to bind to a Sed5p-GST hybrid protein that was immobilized on beads. As shown in Fig. 1 (lanes 1–3), His6-Sec22p bound to Sed5p-GST but not to beads that contained GST (lanes 4–6). Saturable binding of Sec22p (19 pmol) was achieved as the concentration was raised to 5 μm. This is the same concentration at which His6-Bos1p binding saturates Sed5p-GST (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar). To address the possibility that Sec22p may affect the binding of Bos1p to Sed5p, we incubated His6-Bos1p with increasing concentrations of His6-Sec22p. These studies were performed at a concentration of His6-Bos1p (0.5 μm) in which binding to Sed5p was barely detectable (Fig. 2,lane 1). Saturable binding of His6-Bos1p (19.5 pmol) was achieved as the concentration of His6-Sec22p was raised to 5 μm (lanes 2–6). Thus, Sec22p greatly enhances the affinity of Bos1p for Sed5p. To determine if Bos1p facilitates the binding of Sec22p to Sed5p, we performed the reciprocal of the experiment described above. When His6-Sec22p (0.5 μm) was incubated with increasing amounts of His6-Bos1p, saturable binding of Sec22p (18.5 pmol) to Sed5p was observed as the concentration of His6-Bos1p was raised to 5 μm (data not shown). Thus, efficient v-SNARE/t-SNARE interactions require the presence of Bos1p as well as Sec22p. Although Bos1p binds to Sec22p in vitro, 2M. Sacher and S. Ferro-Novick, unpublished observations. we did not detect an interaction between these proteins at the lower concentrations used in this experiment. Thus, the most likely interpretation of our data is that Bos1p and Sec22p cooperatively interact with Sed5p-GST. The ER to Golgi v-SNAREs and their t-SNARE receptor contain domains that are homologous to their neuronal equivalents. Are these the regions where the SNAREs bind to each other? Bos1p, for example, contains a domain (amino acids 136–197) which is 25% identical to the region of synaptobrevin which binds to syntaxin (13Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Previous findings have shown that the leucine at position 190, which lies within this domain, is required for binding to Bet1p but not Sed5p (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar). To determine if other regions of this domain are critical for binding to Sed5p, we created truncations of Bos1p which lie within it and then tested their ability to bind to Sed5p. Whereas His6-Bos1p(1–150), which deletes a significant portion of the synaptobrevin-like domain, was able to bind to Sed5p-GST efficiently (Fig. 3, compare lane 2 withlane 4), the His6-Bos1p(1–135) construct, which lacks the entire region, failed to bind (Fig. 3, compare lane 6 with the GST control in lane 5). Furthermore, the presence of His6-Sec22p did not stimulate the binding of His6-Bos1p(1–135) to Sed5p-GST (not shown). This result was not a consequence of the inability of the antibody to recognize His6-Bos1p(1–135), as His6-Bos1p, His6-Bos1p(1–150), and His6-Bos1p(1–135) were all recognized readily by the anti-Bos1p serum (Fig. 3, lanes 7–9). Similar results were obtained when these constructs were tested for their ability to bind to Sec22p-GST (not shown). Thus, these and previous findings (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar) define two regions of the synaptobrevin-like domain of Bos1p. The extreme amino-terminal portion is required for binding to Sed5p (or Sec22p), whereas the carboxyl terminus interacts with Bet1p (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar). To define the domain of Sec22p which interacts with Sed5p, we focused on amino acids 130–194 because of its homology (32% identity) withDrosophila melanogaster synaptobrevin (Fig. 4and Ref. 3Dascher C. Ossig R. Gallwitz D. Schmitt H.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 872-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We began our analysis by deleting ∼40 amino acids (155–194) of this region (Fig. 4 C) and examining the ability of the truncated protein to bind to Sed5p-GST. As a control, a truncated form of Sec22p which lacks the first 40 residues was tested (Fig. 4 B). Although this construct bound as efficiently as the full-length protein (Fig. 4, A and B), the carboxyl-terminal truncation failed to bind (Fig. 4 C). Thus, as was observed for Bos1p, the region of synaptobrevin homology is essential for the interaction of Sec22p with Sed5p. We reported previously that the bet1–1 mutation maps to a domain of Bet1p which is homologous to SNAP-25, whereasbos1–1 lies within the synaptobrevin-like region of Bos1p (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar). In vitro studies have demonstrated that these mutations disrupt the binding of these proteins to other SNAREs (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the sec22–3 mutation, which blocks transport in vivo (14Novick P. Field C. Schekman R. Cell. 1980; 21: 205-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar), changes the arginine at position 157 to a glycine. Based on earlier findings, we hypothesized that thesec22–3 lesion may block the interaction of Sec22p with Sed5p. To address this possibility, we constructed a His6-tagged form of Sec22p (His6-Sec22p(R157G), which contains the sec22–3 mutation, and tested its ability to interact with Sed5p-GST. As shown in Fig. 5, His6-Sec22p(R157G) failed to bind to Sed5p-GST (comparelanes 4–6 with 1–3). Circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that the spectra of the mutant was the same as wild type (data not shown). Therefore, the failure of His6-Sec22p(R157G) to interact with Sed5p-GST was not a consequence of a change in the secondary structure of the mutant protein. The v-SNAREs Bos1p and Sec22p bind to Sed5p via a domain that is homolgous to synaptobrevin. To define the site on Sed5p which binds these v-SNAREs, we focused our attention on amino acids 252–324. This domain of Sed5p is highly homologous (∼54% identity) to the region of syntaxin which binds to synaptobrevin (15Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Our analysis was performed by testing the ability of His6-Bos1p and His6-Sec22p to bind to portions of Sed5p which were fused to GST. Both His6-tagged proteins bound to Sed5p-GST (Fig. 6, A and D). However, neither interacted with a truncated form of the protein (amino acids 1–251) which lacks the syntaxin-like domain (Fig. 6, B andE). This domain is sufficient for v-SNARE/t-SNARE interactions, since His6-Bos1p and His6-Sec22p bound efficiently to a GST fusion protein that only contains amino acids 251–324 of Sed5p (Fig. 6, C and F). Thus, the regions of Bos1p and Sec22p which are related to synaptobrevin bind to the domain of Sed5p which is homologous to syntaxin. To correlate our in vitro binding studies with interactions that take place in vivo, we determined ifbos1–1 and sec22–3 display synthetic lethality with sed5–1. Synthetic lethality, or inviability of double mutants, is another means of documenting interactions between gene products. It results when the effect of combining two mutations in the same haploid strain causes cell death under normally permissive conditions. The explanation for this event is that the mutated genes encode proteins that have a related function. In some cases, the products may even physically interact with each other (16Rossi G. Jiang Y. Newman A.P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1991; 351: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, the combined effect of both mutations is to disrupt a process to a greater extent than either mutation alone. When sed5–1 was crossed to either bos1–1 or sec22–3, a pattern of synthetic lethality was observed (Table I); that is, the majority of the tetrads had three or two viable spores. This is the anticipated result if the double mutant is inviable. Given our in vitro studies, we conclude that this synthetic lethal pattern is indicative of a physical interaction.Table Ised5–1 lethal interactions with bos1–1 and sec22–3Crossed toFour viableThree viableTwo viableOne viable4−:0+1-aDesignates the number of spores that grew (+) or did not grow (−) at 37 °C.3−:1+2−:2+3−:0+2−:1+1−:2+2−:0+1−:1+0−:2+1−:0+0−:1+bos1–1200015001301sec22–31000151005001-a Designates the number of spores that grew (+) or did not grow (−) at 37 °C. Open table in a new tab Although Bos1p and Sec22p colocalize to the ER and ER to Golgi carrier vesicles (5Newman A.P. Groesch M.E. Ferro-Novick S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3609-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 17Jiang Y. Sacher M. Singer-Krüger B. Lian J.P. Stone S. Ferro-Novick S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), they only form a complex on ER-derived transport vesicles (9Lian J.P. Stone S. Jiang Y. Lyons P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1994; 372: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). As shown above, recombinant Bos1p and Sec22p interact readily with each otherin vitro, and equimolar amounts are present in a complex that forms with Sed5p. In vivo, these v-SNAREs form a 1:1 complex on vesicles before they bind to Sed5p on the Golgi apparatus. If Bos1p and Sec22p both reside on the ER, what prevents them from binding to each other on this compartment? One possibility is that the ER contains an excess of one v-SNARE and because the other is limiting, the Bos1p-Sec22p complex fails to accumulate on this membrane. Since transport vesicles are transient intermediates, the steady-state levels of Bos1p and Sec22p on the ER can be estimated by determining the concentration of these proteins in a total cell lysate. Quantitative immunoblotting revealed that although yeast cells contain 4.25 fmol of Bos1p/μg of lysate there is only 0.30 fmol of Sec22p. Thus, there is approximately 14 times more Bos1p on the ER than Sec22p. Since equal amounts of these proteins are found on vesicles (9Lian J.P. Stone S. Jiang Y. Lyons P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1994; 372: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), a likely interpretation of these data is that the Bos1p-Sec22p complex forms as Sec22p concentrates in budding ER-derived transport vesicles. Here we used in vitro binding studies to show that in ER to Golgi membrane traffic, efficient SNARE interactions require a v-SNARE that is composed of more than one subunit. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time that one of these SNAREs, Sec22p, binds directly to Sed5p. Although Bos1p and Sec22p were shown to be components of the same complex that includes Sed5p (7Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), it was not known if either of these proposed v-SNAREs binds directly to this putative t-SNARE. Our in vitro binding studies indicate that Sec22p (Fig. 1) as well as Bos1p (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar) come in direct contact with Sed5p. The inability of His6-Sec22p(R157G) to bind to the t-SNAREin vitro is consistent with in vivo data showing that the SNARE complex fails to form in the sec22–3 mutant (7Søgaard M. Tani K. Ye R.R. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Kirchhausen T. Rothman J.E. Söllner T. Cell. 1994; 78: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 17Jiang Y. Sacher M. Singer-Krüger B. Lian J.P. Stone S. Ferro-Novick S. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition to containing synaptobrevin-like and syntaxin-related proteins, SNARE complexes contain a SNAP-25 like component. In the ER to Golgi SNARE complex, Bet1p, which contains a domain that is related to SNAP-25, potentiates v-SNARE/t-SNARE interactions via direct contact with Bos1p (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar), or Sec22p.2 Thus, Bet1p appears to act on the different subunits of the v-SNARE to enhance their interaction with the t-SNARE. Although Bet1p, Bos1p, and Sec22p may function in concert with each other, the combined effects of Sec22p and Bet1p on the Bos1p/Sed5p interaction are additive and not synergistic. 3S. Stone and S. Ferro-Novick, unpublished observations. Previous studies have shown that in vivo, these interactions are regulated by the ras-like GTP-binding protein Ypt1p (6Stone, S., Sacher, M., Mao, Y., Carr, C., Lyons, P., Quinn, A. M., and Ferro-Novick, S. (1997) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press.Google Scholar, 9Lian J.P. Stone S. Jiang Y. Lyons P. Ferro-Novick S. Nature. 1994; 372: 698-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Our findings illustrate that regions of yeast SNAREs, which are homologous to their neuronal counterparts, are functionally significant. Although Sed5p, Sec22p, and Bos1p were initially referred to as SNAREs because of this homology and their subcellular distribution, here we have demonstrated the relevance of these homologies at a molecular level. Although we have begun to address the mechanism by which the activity of the v-SNARE is regulated, clearly many other interactions that contribute to this process may take place. For example, Bos1p contains a region from amino acids 1 to 108 which, according to the Lupas algorithm (18Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3470) Google Scholar), has nearly a 100% probability of being involved in a coiled-coil interaction. If this region does not interact with Sed5p, Sec22p, or Bet1p, then some other component, perhaps as yet unknown, may interact with it. Could this coiled-coil domain play a role in the retrieval of Bos1p from the Golgi complex? High copy suppressor analysis or synthetic lethal screens, in addition to in vitro binding studies, may aid in identifying other Bos1p-interacting proteins that regulate v-SNARE activity. Our data, however, underscore the remarkable evolutionary conservation of the basic secretory mechanism from yeast to mammals.

Structurally similar elements called Swi4/Swi6 cell cycle boxes or SCBs (consensus CACGAAAA) are found in the upstream region of theHO endonuclease gene, which is also expressed at G1/S (2Breeden L.

Attachment of MCBs or SCBs to basal promoters fused upstream from reporter genes shows that these elements possess G1/S-specific UAS activity (2Breeden L. Nasmyth K.

Band shift assays using wild type and mutant yeast extracts show that MCBs and SCBs bind a complex containing the transcription factors Swi6 and either Mbp1 or Swi4 (8Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Breeden L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Dirick L. Moll T. Auer H. Nasmyth K.

Band shift assays using purified proteins or in vitro translation products suggest that Swi4 and Mbp1 provide the primary DNA recognition function and that Swi6 enhances the affinity of the complex for its target (10Koch C. Moll T. Neuberg M. Ahorn H. Nasmyth K. Science. 1993; 261: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 12Primig M. Sockanathan S. Auer H. Nasmyth K.

More recently, another complex that binds SCBs but does not contain Swi6 or Swi4 has been reported (14Vemu S. Reichel R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20724-20729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Although the periodicity of MCB-containing genes in vivo and the majority of MCB binding activity in vitro is dependent on an intact MBP1 gene (10Koch C. Moll T. Neuberg M. Ahorn H. Nasmyth K. Science. 1993; 261: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), the idea that Mbp1 regulates MCBs whereas Swi4 regulates SCBs may be inaccurate. Overexpression ofSWI4 in Δswi6 yeast activates MCB reporter genes in vivo (15Morgan B.A. Bouquin N. Merrill G.F. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5679-5689Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and binding of Swi4 to SCBs in vitro is efficiently competed by MCB oligonucleotides (12Primig M. Sockanathan S. Auer H. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1992; 358: 593-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Sidorova J. Breeden L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1067-1077Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Thus, Swi4 may have a role in recognizing and regulating both types of cell cycle box elements. The mechanism linking START and MCB gene induction at G1/S is unresolved. In considering how Swi6 could be activated by START, it has been noted that Swi6 is a phosphoprotein in vivo, contains several potential Cdc28 phosphorylation sites, and can be phosphorylated by human Cdc2 immune complexes in vitro (8Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Breeden L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1992; 357: 505-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, site-directed mutations that eliminate all the potential Cdc28 phosphorylation sites in Swi6 do not eliminate MCB gene periodicity (16Sidorova J. Mikesell G. Breeden L. Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology Meeting, Seattle, WA, August 16-20, 1994. 1994; (abstr.): p.8Google Scholar). SWI4 is maximally expressed at G1/S and contains functional MCB sites in its upstream region (7Foster R. Mikesell G.E. Breeden L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3792-3801Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that Swi4 autostimulation may be a key process in inducing MCB gene transcription at G1/S. However, constitutive expression ofSWI4 from a heterologous promoter does not eliminate G1/S gene periodicity (17Breeden L. Mikesell G. Genetics. 1994; 138: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MCB binding activity measured in band shift assays is mildly periodic, with peak levels at G1/S (4Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, the presence of MCB binding activity, at least as measured in vitro, is not sufficient for MCB gene expression, as MCB binding activity is abundant in α-factor-arrested cells, even though such cells show repressed MCB gene expression (4Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In summary, although important cis- andtrans-acting elements have been identified, the actual biochemical link connecting START and G1/S-specific transcription remains elusive. To search for additional gene products that participate in activating MCB genes following START, we screened for mutations that allowed efficient expression of MCB reporter genes in Δswi6 yeast. Analysis of the mutations revealed that thioredoxin reductase represses MCB reporter gene expression, and suggests a model whereby thioredoxin oxidation may contribute to increased transcription of certain genes at G1/S. The 2μ-based plasmids containing the MCB/LacZ and mutMCB/LacZ reporter genes were described previously (4Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), where they were referred to as pLGΔ178.3M and pLGΔ178.3mut, respectively. MCB/LacZ contains threeMluI sites, separated and flanked by XhoI sites, and cloned into the XhoI site at CYC1 base −178 (with respect to the start codon) in plasmid pLGΔ178 (18Guarente L. Mason T. Cell. 1983; 32: 1279-1286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In mutMCB/LacZ, the MCB consensus ACGCGT was mutated to ACtaGT, which destroys UAS activity in vivo and band shifting activity in vitro (4Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The plasmid pBd177, which consists of a 3-kb HindIII/Bgl2 SWI6 fragment cloned into the LEU2-marked 2μ-based vector pZUC, was obtained from L. Breeden (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). TheLEU2-marked, 2μ-based libraries YL1, YL2, and YL3 libraries (19Chien C.-T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1218) Google Scholar) were obtained from P. Bartel (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories). The LEU2-marked,ARS/CEN-based library YpH1 was obtained from P. Hieter (Johns Hopkins University). The plasmid pMCB/HIS3 was constructed in two steps. First, a 317-base pair fragment containing three tandemly linked MCB elements and the CYC1 basal promoter was generated by PCR usingXbaI-linearized MCB/LacZ plasmid as template and the oligonucleotides 5′-CTAAACTCACAAATTAGAG and 5′-CGGGATCCTGTGTATTTGTGTTTGG as primers. The latter primer introduced a terminal BamHI site 3′ to CYC1 base −14 (with respect to the start codon). The PCR product was cut withBamHI and inserted into pRS305 vector (20Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that had been cut with XbaI, filled-in with T4 DNA polymerase and cut withBamHI, thus creating an interim plasmid containing the MCB/CYC1 promoter. A second PCR product, extending from −7 to +813 with respect to the HIS3 start codon was generated using EcoRI-linearized pRS303 (20Sikorski R. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as template and the oligonucleotides 5′-CGGGATCCGGCAAAGATGACAGAGC and 5′-GCCGTCGACGCGCGCCTCGTTCAGAATG as primers. The first primer introduced a terminal BamHI fragment 5′ to HIS3 base −7, and the second primer introduced a SalI site 3′ toHIS3 base +813. The second PCR product was cut withBamHI and SalI and inserted into a vector prepared by cutting the interim plasmid with BamHI andSalI. Functionality of the MCB/CYC1 promoter andHIS3 coding region in the resulting plasmid, pMCB/HIS3, was confirmed by transformingHpaI-linearized pMCB/HIS3 into W303–1a usingLEU2 selection and confirming that transformants grew in the absence of histidine and the presence of 50 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (ATZ). Strains are listed in Table I. Except for differences specified in the text or tables, strains were isogenic to W303. To obtain a Δswi6:TRP1 strain that lacked an integrated ho-LacZ gene and unidentified ade and met mutations, BY600 was mated to W303–1α. Diploids were sporulated, and dissected tetrads were assayed for β-galactosidase and nutritional auxotrophies. Tetrads yielding two Trp+ β-galactosidase-negative colonies and two Trp− β-galactosidase-positive colonies were used to identify Δswi6:TRP1 yeast that had lost the ho-LacZ gene. From these, strains MY1 and MY2 were selected based on the additional criteria of red color (indicating the ade2 mutation was unaccompanied by otherade mutations) and methionine prototrophy. Strain MY10 was derived by transforming BY600 with HpaI-linearized pMCB/HIS3 and selecting for leucine prototrophy. Integration at leu2 was confirmed genetically by linkage analysis. Strain MY196, which carried a Δtrr1:HIS3 disruption mutation, was derived using the method of Baudin et al. (21Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3328-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). Strain MY183, which was homozygous for the his3Δ200 deletion mutation, was transformed with a PCR fragment containing the intact HIS3 gene sandwiched between the first 38 and last 34 nucleotides of the TRR1 protein coding region. The PCR primers were 5-ATGGTTCACAACAAAGTTACTATCATTGGTTCAGGTCCTGATGCGGTATTTTC and 5-TTCTAGGGAAGTTAAGTATTTCTCAGCATCCAAAGCTGTCTGTAAGCGGATGC. DNA from His+ transformants was analyzed by a Southern blot assay to determine whether TRR1 was disrupted. MY183 was derived by crossing YM2061 (MATa ade2–101 ura3–52 LEU2:GAL1/LacZ his3Δ200 metT lys2–801) (obtained from M. Johnston, Washington U.) to MY179 (MATα ade2 ura3 leu2 trp1 his3Δ200 metT ho:LacZ), which itself was derived by crossing YM2061 to MY171 (MATα leu2 ura3 trp1 metS ho:LacZ). MY171 was derived by crossing CG378 (MATa ade5 ura3–52 leu2–3 trp1–289) (4Lowndes N.F. Johnson A.L. Johnston L.H. Nature. 1991; 350: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with MY43. Strains with lys2 mutations were selected by growth on appropriately supplemented ammonium sulfate-free YNB agar containing 0.2% aminoadipate, and confirmed by showing that lysine prototrophy was restored by transforming with the LYS2-containing plasmid p8LYS2 (S. Sedgewick, National Institute for Medical Research, London). Standard yeast genetic techniques were used for tetrad dissections and random spore preparations (22Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). For lys2 heterozygotes, spores were plated on aminoadipate plates, to select against residual diploid cells. For cells carrying trr1:HIS3alleles, it was necessary to plate spores on YEPD. Ethylmethylsulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis was done as described by Rose et al. (22Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar). In a pilot experiment, treatment with 30 μg/ml EMS gave optimal results, reducing viability by 50% and increasing the frequency of aminoadipate-competent clones 25-fold above the control level of 10−5/viable cell. To isolate mutants, 108 MY10Z cells were either treated with 30 μg/ml EMS or mock-treated, and 2 × 106 cells were spread on each of five 10-cm plates containing YNB agar supplemented with adenine, methionine, and 10 mm ATZ. An activated MCB/HIS3 reporter gene produces sufficient imidazole dehydratase activity to result in ATZ-resistance. By 2.5 days after plating, EMS-treated and mock-treated cells gave 50 and 8 ATZ-resistant colonies/plate, respectively. When corrected for the number of viable cells plated in each group (determined by spreading aliquots on histidine-supplemented plates), the frequency of ATZ-resistant cells was 125 × 10−5 in the EMS-treated population and 6 × 10−5 in the mock-treated population. All 250 ATZ-resistant clones from the EMS treatment group were patched to selective plates and assayed for MCB/LacZ reporter gene activation by filter β-galactosidase assay. Sixty-four gave blue color in the assay, and of these, 30 were randomly selected for further analysis. RNA was isolated from yeast using glass beads and hot phenol (24Aves S.J. Durkacz B.W. Carr A. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). RNA concentration was determined by A 260, assuming 1 OD = 40 μg/ml. RNA (2–10 μg) was denatured and fractionated by electrophoresis through 1% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels as described by Lehrach et al. (25Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar) except that 10 mm MOPS, 4 mm sodium acetate, 0.5 mm EDTA was used as buffer. Gels were rinsed 5 min with water, stained 5 min with 1 μg/ml EtBr, rinsed 15 min with water, and blotted overnight to buffer-equilibrated GeneScreen (DuPont) using 10 × SSC (1 × SSC = 60 mm NaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7) as transfer buffer. After UV-cross-linking (1200 J using a Stratalinker), blots were rinsed in 2 × SSC, prehybridized 3 h at 42 °C in 5–10 ml of Stark's buffer (50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 25 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.5, 0.02% each of bovine serum albumin, Ficoll 400, and polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 250 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA), and hybridized in 5–10 ml of 4:1 Stark's buffer:dextran sulfate containing 3 × 104 Bq of radiolabeled probe. Probes were labeled with (α32P)dCTP (3000 Ci/mm, NEN Life Science Products) using a Random Priming DNA Labeling System kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer, except that incorporated radioactivity was isolated by chromatography through a 5-ml Sephadex G50 column equilibrated with 1 × TES buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS). Hybridization probes used were: RNR1, 2.6-kbEcoRI fragment from pSE738 (S. Elledge, Baylor College of Medicine); SWI4, 3.2-kb HindIII fragment from p3–24 (cloned from YL3 library) 2G. F. Merrill, unpublished results. ;SWI6, 1.9-kb HindIII/EcoRI fragment from pBd177 (L. Breeden); TMP1, 1.3-kbHindIII/EcoRI fragment from pEM54 (3McIntosh E.M. Atkinson T. Storms R.D. Smith M. Mol. Cell.

Blots were washed twice for 5 min at room temperature with 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and three times for 15 min at 50 °C with 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Washed blots were exposed 1–4 days to x-ray film or PhosphorImager plate. Plates were analyzed using a model PSI486 PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Prints were prepared using Adobe Photoshop, version 2.5.1 (Adobe Systems) and ClarisWorks, version 3 (Claris) software. Southern blots were done essentially as described for Northern blots except that agarose gels containing 1 × TAE (100 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm acetate/acetic acid, 10 mmEDTA) were used and BA85 nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) was used instead of GeneScreen. To confirm Δtrr1:HIS3disruption, transformant DNA digested withHindIII/EcoRI was blotted and probed with a radiolabeled 1.9-kb EcoRI/XhoI TRR1fragment. To confirm nondisruptional tagging of the TRR1locus, DNA digested with EcoRI was blotted and probed with a radiolabeled 2.1-kb Bgl2/XhoI TRR1fragment. For liquid β-galactosidase assays, exponentially growing yeast were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 250 μl of breakage buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol), and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes on ice. After adding 500-μm glass beads (Sigma) to the meniscus and 12 μl of 40 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, yeast were disrupted by intermittent vortexing and chilling. Lysate was siphoned to fresh tubes and clarified by microcentrifugation for 15 min, and aliquots of the supernatant were diluted with breakage buffer to 90 μl and mixed with 800 μl of Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, adjusted to pH 7), 2 μl of 12m β-mercaptoethanol, and 180 μl 13 μm o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside. After 30 min at 30 °C, reactions were stopped by addition of 450 μl of 1m Na2CO3 and absorbance at 420 nm was determined to measure the extent of ONP production, assuming 1 OD = 222 nmol/ml. The protein concentration of clarified lysates were determined by the Bradford method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. For filter β-galactosidase assays, yeast colonies were replica-plated to Whatman no. 1 filters, frozen in liquid N2, thawed, laid in a Petri plate on a filter presoaked with 2 ml of Z buffer, 2 μl of 12 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 50 μl of 40 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside in Me2SO, and incubated at 30 °C until blue color developed (1–2 h). To identify mutations that activated MCB reporter genes inΔswi6 yeast, strain MY10Z, which carried an integrated MCB-dependent HIS3 reporter gene (MCB/HIS3) and an episomal MCB-dependentLacZ reporter gene (MCB/LacZ) was mutagenized with EMS and plated on medium lacking histidine and containing ATZ. Cells that formed colonies on ATZ were assayed for β-galactosidase using a filter assay. Sixty-four out of 250 ATZ-resistant colonies gave blue color. Thirty ATZ-resistant, β-galactosidase-positive mutants were randomly selected for further characterization. The mutants were grown in liquid culture and lysates were assayed quantitatively for β-galactosidase activity. Table II shows β-galactosidase levels in the mutants, arranged in descending order of LacZ activation. As evident from the second column in Table II, β-galactosidase levels varied from 7- to 70-fold over the background levels in Δswi6 parental strain MY10Z.Table IYeast StrainsStrainGenotype1-aWhere the presence of ho:LacZ was uncertain, strains were designated ±ho:LacZ.

https://openalex.org/W2094487007,"Alzheimer's disease is characterized by senile plaques composed of polymeric fibrils of beta amyloid (Aβ), a 39–42-amino acid peptide formed after proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (βAPP). Heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been shown to colocalize with Aβ in Alzheimer's disease brain, and experimental evidence indicates that the interactions between the proteoglycan and the peptide are important for the promotion, deposition, and/or persistence of the senile plaques. Studies in rat brain indicated that both the core protein and the heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains are required for amyloid fiber formation and deposition in vivo (Snow, A. D., Sekiguchi, R., Nochlin, D., Fraser, P., Kimata, K., Mizutani, A., Arai, M., Schreier, W. A., and Morgan, D. G. (1994) Neuron 12, 219–234), suggesting that one mechanism to prevent the formation of Aβ-heparan sulfate proteoglycan complexes that lead to deposition of amyloid would be to degrade the proteoglycan. Normally, heparan sulfate proteoglycans are internalized and degraded to short glycosaminoglycans by intracellular heparanases. These reactions occur in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway, which is the same intracellular location where βAPP is processed to Aβ. Using partially purified heparanase activities from Chinese hamster ovary cells we examined whether Aβ(1–40) affects the catabolism of Chinese hamster ovary heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans in vitro. Aβ(1–40) binds to both the long heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans attached to core proteins and the short, heparanase-derived chains in a concentration-dependent and pH-dependent manner. When Aβ(1–40) is added to heparanase assays, it prevents the partially purified activities from releasing heparan sulfate chains from core proteins and degrading them to short glycosaminoglycans; however, a large molar excess of the peptide to heparan sulfate is required to see the effect. Our results suggest that normally the levels of Aβ in the endosomal pathway are not sufficient to interfere with heparanase activity in vivo. However, once the level of Aβ-peptides are elevated, as they are in Alzheimer's disease, they could interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans and prevent their catabolism. This could promote the formation and deposition of amyloid, since the binding of Aβ to the proteoglycan species will predominate.

Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and heparin converts Aβ(11–28) into macrofibers (2Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. Chin D.T. Kirschner D.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It may be that in vivo, stabilization of the aggregates and decreased amyloid susceptibility to proteolysis require Aβ to interact with both the core protein and HS chains.Production of Aβ from the amyloid precursor protein is thought to occur primarily in the endosomal-lysosomal pathway (7Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HSPGs are initially degraded to short glycosaminoglycan chains in the same intracellular location (10Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brauker J.H. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13093-13101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), so it is possible that this is where the Aβ-HSPG interaction necessary for plaque formation occurs. In endosomes, HS glycosaminoglycans are released from core proteins and cleaved to short oligosaccharides by enzymes called heparanases (10Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brauker J.H. Wang J.L. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2245-2251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Catabolism of HSPGs by heparanases may be important for preventing the formation of Aβ-proteoglycan complexes that result in the production of amyloid deposits. After heparanases act on the proteoglycan, the glycosaminoglycan and core protein binding sites will have been physically separated. Aβ may still be able to bind to the core protein, but the short HS glycosaminoglycans remaining on the protein may not be sufficient to stabilize the interactions necessary for fiber formation and deposition.Recent studies show Aβ peptide is protected from proteases by virtue of its association with HS glycosaminoglycans (14Gupta-Bansal R. Frederickson R.C.A. Brunden K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18666-18671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It may be that a reciprocal arrangement exists, where the association of Aβ with the polysaccharide prevents heparanases from degrading the HS chain. Inhibiting heparanase action may promote the formation of amyloid plaques since the binding of Aβ to intact proteoglycans will predominate. Using partially purified heparanase activities from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, we have examined whether Aβ(1–40) peptide affects the catabolism of HS glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans in vitro. Our results suggest that the association of Aβ with HS protects the glycosaminoglycan from degradation by heparanases.DISCUSSIONAlzheimer's disease is characterized by extracellular amyloid deposits, or senile plaques, composed of polymeric fibrils of Aβ, a 39–42-amino acid peptide formed after proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) (25Selkoe D.J.

A number of other macromolecules colocalize with Aβ in the plaque, including HSPGs (1Snow A.D. Sekiguchi R. Nochlin D. Fraser P. Kimata K. Mizutani A. Arai M. Schreier W.A. Morgan D.G.

Over the years a body of experimental evidence has accumulated which indicates HSPGs play a role in the promotion, deposition, and persistence of the fibrillar form of Aβ present in plaques (1Snow A.D.

Frederickson R.C.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), cause Aβ fibers to form bundles (2Fraser P.E. Nguyen J.T. Chin D.T. Kirschner D.A. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1531-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), and protect the fibrillar Aβ from proteases (14Gupta-Bansal R. Frederickson R.C.A. Brunden K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18666-18671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although only the glycosaminoglycan is required for these interactions in vitro, both the HS chain and the core protein are required for amyloid fiber formation and deposition in vivo (1Snow A.D. Sekiguchi R. Nochlin D. Fraser P. Kimata K. Mizutani A. Arai M. Schreier W.A. Morgan D.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 219-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Since Aβ has been shown to bind to both the glycosaminoglycan and core protein (4Buée L. Ding W. Delacourte A. Fillit H.M. Brain Res. 1993; 601: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Buée L. Ding W. Anderson J.P. Narindrasorasak S. Kisilevsky R. Boyle N.J. Ropbakis N.K. Delacourte A. Greenberg B. Fillit H.M. Brain Res. 1993; 627: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it may be that both interactions are required. Alternatively, fibril formation and deposition of Aβ may only require HS chains, but to create an environment that stabilizes the Aβ-HS interactions, the glycosaminoglycan chains must be physically clustered on a core protein.If intact proteoglycans are important macromolecular species for formation of senile plaques in vivo, then one would predict that their normal catabolism may play an important role in preventing Alzheimer's disease. HS glycosaminoglycans are cleaved from the core protein and degraded to short oligosaccharides by heparanases (10Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our in vitro studies show Aβ(1–40) prevents partially purified heparanase activities from degrading long HS chains to short glycosaminoglycans. The large molar excess of Aβ(1–40) to HS required to inhibit chain degradation by heparanases suggests that multiple molecules of the peptide must bind the glycosaminoglycan. Soreghan et al. (24Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that Aβ(1–40) and higher Aβ species could form aggregates due to the hydrophobic amino acids at the carboxyl terminus. The critical concentration of the peptide necessary to form these aggregates is 25 μm (24Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is the concentration of Aβ(1–40) where we first detect inhibition of heparanase activity (Fig. 6 A). This suggests that beginning at this concentration, Aβ(1–40) forms associations with itself and with HS chains that result in the glycosaminoglycan being protected from heparanases. Based on their studies, Soreghan et al.(24Soreghan B. Kosmoski J. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28551-28554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposed that Aβ fibrils are organized as “tubular micelles” with the polar domain of the Aβ peptide (residues 1–28) forming the outer wall and the hydrophobic amino acids in the center. HS chains may lie along the outside of the fibril because of interactions between sulfate groups on the polysaccharide and the histidine or lysine side chains in the polar domain of Aβ (3Brunden K.R. Richter-Cook N.J. Chaturvedi N. Frederickson R.C.A. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 2147-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Gupta-Bansal R. Frederickson R.C.A. Brunden K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18666-18671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Presumably, once the HS chain is associated with the fibril its normal helix structure (26Ernst S. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasiskeharan R. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 387-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) is altered so that the glycosaminoglycan is no longer recognized by heparanases. At lower Aβ(1–40) concentrations, it may be that only small aggregates or fibrils are formed, so a portion of the HS chains is still susceptible to the enzyme (Fig. 6). However, once the concentration of the peptide is increased to 150 μm the entire glycosaminoglycan associates with the fibrils and is protected from degradation (Fig. 6). At higher Aβ concentrations, the HS glycosaminoglycans may also promote interactions between Aβ fibrils, leading to the aggregates observed in Alzheimer's disease.If the association of Aβ with glycosaminoglycan chains prevents heparanases from degrading HSPGs in vivo, how might this contribute to Alzheimer's disease? There is evidence that once βAPP reaches the cell surface it is internalized and cleaved by proteases to generate peptides that contain the Aβ sequence (8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17386-17389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Selkoe D.J. Yamazaki T. Citron M. Podlisny M.B. Koo E.H. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 777: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase experiments suggest the production of Aβ-containing fragments occurs in an acidic compartment near the cell surface, presumably endosomes (7Haass C. Selkoe D.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 1039-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar, 8Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

Sci. 1996; 777: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This is the same intracellular compartment where heparanases begin degrading HSPGs (10Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bame K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19956-19964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brauker J.H. Wang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13093-13101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under normal conditions the concentration of Aβ-containing fragments in endosomes (high pm to low nm range, Ref. 25Selkoe D.J. Yamazaki T. Citron M. Podlisny M.B. Koo E.H. Teplow D.B. Haass C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 777: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) will be too low to affect catabolism of the proteoglycans. However, once the levels of Aβ fragments are elevated in Alzheimer's disease, the peptides could aggregate into fibrils and interact with the HSPGs in this compartment. The association of Aβ with the proteoglycan would prevent heparanases from degrading the HS glycosaminoglycans on the core protein to short oligosaccharides. This will result in an increased level of HSPGs, which could stabilize the aggregates and prevent them from being degraded by proteases (1Snow A.D. Sekiguchi R. Nochlin D. Fraser P. Kimata K. Mizutani A. Arai M. Schreier W.A. Morgan D.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 219-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 14Gupta-Bansal R. Frederickson R.C.A. Brunden K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18666-18671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar).This hypothesis is supported by experiments that suggest that Aβ peptides stimulate the accumulation of amyloidogenic fragments of βAPP inside cells (9Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). When Aβ(1–42) is added to the media of cultured cells, it is internalized in a concentration-dependent manner (9Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 27Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and accumulates in an aggregated, protease-resistant form within late endosomes or secondary lysosomes (27Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Even at low concentrations of Aβ(1–42) in the medium (100 μg/ml), more than 10 pg of peptide was internalized per cell (27Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), suggesting that the concentration of Aβ(1–42) inside cells is more than sufficient to affect HSPG catabolism by heparanases. Interestingly, if the cells were transfected with βAPP to increase the levels of expressed precursor, the exogenously added Aβ(1–42) stimulated the production of Aβ-containing fragments from the precursor protein, which also accumulated inside the cell (9Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It was postulated that the amyloidogenic fragments produced from βAPP by normal processes interacted with the Aβ(1–42) aggregates, and this association allowed them to escape the normal degradation pathways (9Yang A.J. Knauer M. Burdick D.A. Glabe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14786-14792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).The researchers in these studies did not examine whether the Aβ(1–42) aggregates were associated with other macromolecules (27Knauer M.F. Soreghan B. Burdick D. Kosmoski J. Glabe C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7437-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), but it is possible that they were resistant to proteases, in part, because of interactions with HSPGs (14Gupta-Bansal R. Frederickson R.C.A. Brunden K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18666-18671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). If the Aβ(1–42) aggregates prevented the degradation of cell-associated HSPGs, the proteoglycans would then be available to interact with the other Aβ fragments and convert them to species that are resistant to proteolysis. It would be interesting to examine the ratio of HSPGs to free glycosaminoglycans in cells transfected with βAPP and see if this ratio changes when the cells are cultured in the presence of Aβ(1–42). If the accumulation of Aβ-containing fragments is dependent on decreased catabolism of proteoglycans, then there should be a higher proportion of cell-associated HSPGs when the cells are cultured with Aβ(1–42). An increase in the concentration of intracellular HS because of its interaction with Aβ peptides may also play a role in the formation of the neurofibrillary tangles present in Alzheimer's disease. When tau protein is incubated with HS or heparin in vitro, paired helical filaments, similar to neurofibrillary tangles, are formed (28Goeder M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical examination of Alzheimer's disease brain tissue suggests that accumulation of HS may be the initial event in the process (28Goeder M. Jakes R. Spillantini M.G. Hasegawa M. Smith M.J. Crowther R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that alterations in HS catabolism may be a common link to the formation of both plaques and tangles.The inhibition of heparanase activity may have another effect on the formation of stable Aβ deposits. We showed that Aβ(1–40) could bind to both the long HS chains on core proteins and the short glycosaminoglycans produced by heparanases (Fig. 1) and that the short HS could compete with the long chains for the peptide (Fig. 4). The studies by Snow et al. (1Snow A.D. Sekiguchi R. Nochlin D. Fraser P. Kimata K. Mizutani A. Arai M. Schreier W.A. Morgan D.G. Neuron. 1994; 12: 219-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) would suggest that complexes formed between Aβ-containing peptides and short HS chains do not lead to amyloid deposits, and others have reported that small polysulfated molecules can displace HS glycosaminoglycans or proteoglycans bound to Aβ(1–28) affinity columns (29Leveugle B. Scanameo A. Ding W. Fillit H. NeuroReport. 1994; 5: 1389-1392PubMed Google Scholar) or disassemble preformed Aβ(1–40) fibrils (30Kisilevsky R. Lemieux L.J. Fraser P.E. Kong X. Hultin P.G. Szarek W.A. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to degrading the proteoglycan species that would otherwise be found in senile plaques, heparanases may be generating glycosaminoglycan species that act to prevent Aβ aggregation and deposition. Histochemical and immunocytochemical studies have shown that heparan sulfate (HS) 1The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; Aβ, β-amyloid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; βAPP, β-amyloid precursor protein; CPC, cetyl pyridinium chloride. 1The abbreviations used are: HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, heparan sulfate proteoglycan; Aβ, β-amyloid; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; βAPP, β-amyloid precursor protein; CPC, cetyl pyridinium chloride. proteoglycans (HSPGs) and glycosaminoglycans colocalize with β-amyloid protein (Aβ) in the senile plaques characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (1Snow A.D.

FASEB J. 1993; 7: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Aβ binds to HSPGs with high affinity, and interestingly, it interacts with both the core protein and the glycosaminoglycan chains (3Brunden K.R. Richter-Cook N.J. Chaturvedi N. Frederickson R.C.A. J.

This is somewhat surprising, since in vitro, HS chains alone can cause both Aβ(1–28) and Aβ(1–40) to aggregate (3Brunden K.R. Richter-Cook N.J. Chaturvedi N. Frederickson R.C.A. J.

It may be that in vivo, stabilization of the aggregates and decreased amyloid susceptibility to proteolysis require Aβ to interact with both the core protein and HS chains.

Consistent with the RNA data, polyclonal antibodies for α1(XIX) collagen reacted with a 150-kDa protein in the neutral salt extraction of adult mouse brain tissues. We therefore propose that type XIX collagen plays a distinct role from the other FACIT molecules, particularly in the assembly of embryonic matrices and in the maintenance of specific adult tissues.

https://openalex.org/W2003275808,"The variance of writhe, the contribution of writhe to supercoiling, and the free energies of supercoiling were calculated for (CTG·CAG) n and (CGG·CCG) n triplet repeat sequences (TRS) by statistical mechanics from the bending and torsional moduli previously determined. Expansions of these sequences are inherited by non-mendelian transmission and are linked with several hereditary neuromuscular diseases. The variance of writhe was greater for the TRS than for random B-DNA. For random B-DNA, (CGG) n, and (CTG) n, the contribution of writhe to supercoiling was 70, 78, and 79%, whereas the free energy of supercoiling at a length of 10 kilobase pairs was 1040·RT, 760·RT, and 685·RT, respectively. These data indicate that the TRS are preferential sites for the partitioning of supercoiling. Calculations of the differences in free energy of supercoiling between the TRS and random B-DNA revealed a local minimum at ∼520 base pairs. Human medical genetic studies have shown that individuals carrying up to 180–200 copies of TRS (540–600 base pairs, premutations) in the fragile X or myotonic dystrophy gene loci are usually asymptomatic, whereas large expansions (>200 repeats, full mutations), which lead to disease, are observed in their offspring. Therefore, the length corresponding to the local minimum in free energy of supercoiling correlates with the genetic breakpoint between premutation and full mutation. We propose that (a) TRS instability is mediated by DNA mispairing caused by the accumulation of supercoiling within the repeats, and (b) the expansions that take place at the premutation to full mutation threshold are associated with increased mispairing caused by the optimal partitioning of writhe within the TRS at this length."
https://openalex.org/W2076310395,"Interactions among proteins in the Bcl-2 family regulate the onset of programmed cell death. Previous work has shown that the death-inhibiting family members Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL form heterodimers with the death-promoting homologue Bax and that certain site-directed mutants of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL lose both biological activity and the ability to bind Bax. To better understand the structural basis of heterodimer formation, we have used a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen for mutants of Bax that regain the ability to bind to these inactive Bcl-2(G145A) and Bcl-xL(G138A) mutants. This screen identified a series of C-terminally truncated Bax molecules that contain complete BH3 (Bcl-2 homology domain 3) domains but that have lost BH1 and BH2 sequences. These results indicate that while the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL mutants fail to bind full-length Bax, they still retain a binding site for the critical BH3 domain. This suggests that conformational constraints in full-length Bax regulate its ability to bind to other Bcl-2 family members. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the normally inert Bcl-2(G145A) mutant effectively blocks apoptosis induced by a C-terminally truncated Bax molecule, but does not block apoptosis induced by wild-type Bax. This demonstrates that cell protection can be effected by directly binding pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family.

For example, in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, the bcl-2 homologueced-9 acts to inhibit developmental cell deaths. This is evidenced by the elevated levels of cell death that characterize the embryos of loss-of-function ced-9 mutants (3Hengartner M.E. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R.

Similarly, in cultured mammalian cells, apoptosis is inhibited by the expression of several family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1 (5Hockenbery D.M. Nuñez G. Milliman C.

In contrast to the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, mammalian cells also express family members that promote apoptosis. For example, Bax and Bak have been shown to kill when overexpressed in mammalian cells and can antagonize the cell-protective functions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (11Oltvai Z. Milliman C. Korsmeyer S.J.

Immunoprecipitation studies using genetically engineered cells first demonstrated that members of the Bcl-2 family can form protein-protein dimers with each other. These studies demonstrated that the Bcl-2 molecule can form a heterodimer with Bax and can also form a homodimer with another Bcl-2 molecule (11Oltvai Z. Milliman C. Korsmeyer S.J.

Similarly, Bcl-xL and Bax can form heterodimers, although there has been controversy concerning the ability of Bcl-xL to homodimerize (18Zhang H. Saeed B. Ng S.-C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Mutations in the BH1 and BH2 domains have been shown to abrogate the death-inhibiting functions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. For example, mutation of the highly conserved glycine 145 to alanine in Bcl-2 (15Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), or the homologous G138A mutation in Bcl-xL (17Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), renders the respective proteins functionally inactive. These mutations also abrogate the ability of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to dimerize with Bax (15Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 17Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Based on these results and the results obtained with additional BH1 and BH2 mutants (15Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), it was suggested that the death-inhibiting function of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL is dependent on their ability to form Bax heterodimers. Further mutagenesis work, however, has identified Bcl-xL mutants that do not bind Bax, but that still block apoptosis, suggesting that inhibition of cell death does not require heterodimerization (24Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the observation that the G145A and G138A mutations in Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, respectively, are inactive suggests that the structure of this region of these molecules is important for biological function.Mutagenesis studies on the death-promoting Bcl-2 family members Bak and Bax indicate that the BH3 domains of these molecules are critical both for induction of apoptosis and for binding to Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 (22Chittenden T.

The three-dimensional structure of Bcl-xL, derived by x-ray diffraction and NMR techniques, demonstrates the presence of a hydrophobic groove on the Bcl-xL surface (25Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W.

Glycine 138 forms part of this groove, and it was therefore further suggested that the bulkier alanine in the G138A mutant may block Bak or Bax from entering the binding pocket (25Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W.

This approach was based on the strategy that was successfully used to identify mutants of Raf-1 that bind Ras(E37G), a Ras mutant with which wild-type Raf-1 does not interact (27White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Aelst L.V. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that the G145A and G138A mutants of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL retain intact binding sites for dimerization partners, but suggest that structural constraints in full-length Bax prevent it from occupying those sites. Our results further indicate that Bcl-2 family members can inhibit cell death directly as a result of binding death-promoting family members.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid ConstructsYeast Two-hybrid PlasmidsHuman Bax minus its transmembrane domain (Bax(−TM)) was PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside. -amplified to add EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites and then subcloned into vector pJG4-5 (28Gyuris J.

They were excised asEcoRI/XhoI fragments and ligated into the bait vector pGilda, which produces a LexA fusion protein. Bcl-2(G145A)(-TM) was PCR-amplified from plasmid M1-3 (15Yin X.-M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar) and subcloned into the vectors pGilda and pJG4-5. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on Bcl-xL (in pBluescript (Stratagene)) to generate mutants F131V,D133A and G148E,G187A using the Muta-Gene M13 Kit (Bio-Rad). The mutants were subsequently PCR-amplified and subcloned into pGilda asEcoRI/XhoI fragments.Mammalian Expression PlasmidsBcl-2, Bcl-2(G145A), and Bax, including their transmembrane-spanning domains, were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCIneo (Promega) to yield pCIBcl-2, pCIBcl-2(G145A), and pCIBax, respectively. To generate an expression construct for BaxΔC with a transmembrane domain (BaxΔC+TM), two separate PCRs were performed with Bax(wt) (where wt is wild-type) in pCIneo as a template to generate two fragments of 369 and 94 base pairs, respectively. The following primers were used: 5′-ATC AGT GAA TTC ACT ATG GAC GGG GAG-3′, 5′-CGC CAC AAA GAT GGT CAC GTT GAA GTT GCC GTC AGA AAA CAT GTC-3′, 5′-TCT GAC GGC AAC TTC AAC GTG ACC ATC TTT GTG GCG GGA GTG-3′, and 5′-ATC GAT CTC GAG TCA GCC CAT CTT CTT CCA GAT-3′. BaxΔC+TM was generated by annealing these two PCR products together (95 °C, 5 min; 65 °C, 5 min; and cooling slowly to <30 °C) and amplifying the resulting fragment. The final 463-base pair fragment was gel-isolated, digested with EcoRI and XhoI, and ligated into EcoRI/SalI-digested pCIneo.Bacterial Expression PlasmidsFor GST and 6-histidine fusion proteins, Bcl-2(G145A), Bcl-xL, Bcl-xL(G138A), Bcl-xL(F131V,D133A), Bcl-xL(G148E,G187A), and Bax were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) or pET15b (Novagen) and expressed in bacteria. In each case, the C-terminal membrane-spanning domain was deleted. The construct for expression of GST-Bcl-2 coding for amino acids 1–218 of human Bcl-2 was a generous gift from Dr. John Reed.Protein Expression and Solid-phase Protein-Protein Binding AssaysProtein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to bacteria transformed with the appropriate bacterial expression vector and grown in 3-liter batches in shaker flasks. Expressed proteins were purified by one-step affinity chromatography using His-Bind® metal chelation resin (Novagen) (for 6-histidine fusion proteins) or glutathione-Sepharose columns (Pharmacia) on a Pharmacia FPLC system (21Diaz J.-L. Oltersdorf T. Horne W. McConnell M. Wilson G. Weeks S. Garcia T. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11350-11355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) (for GST fusion proteins), and their purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined using a bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The solid-phase binding assays were performed as described previously (21Diaz J.-L. Oltersdorf T. Horne W. McConnell M. Wilson G. Weeks S. Garcia T. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11350-11355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6-histidine-tagged proteins were coated onto microtiter wells, which were then incubated with a GST-tagged binding partner. Binding was then detected with an anti-GST monoclonal antibody and a conjugated secondary antibody.Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction AssaysTo generate a library of mutant Bax plasmids, pJG4-5-Bax was transformed into Escherichia coli strain XLRed (Stratagene), and DNA was purified from 1 × 1010 cells.Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (MATα ura3 trp1 his3 LEU2::pLexAop3-LEU2) was transformed with the following plasmids: pGilda-Bcl-2(G145A), p18-34 (28Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1319) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of the pJG4-5-Bax library DNA. 500,000 transformants were screened for growth in the absence of leucine and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The library plasmid was recovered from selected clones, and DNA sequence analysis was performed using an Applied Biosystems Model 377 sequencer.For quantitative β-galactosidase activity assays, each bait vector was cotransformed with its respective prey plasmid and the reporter plasmid p18-34 into yeast strain EGY191 (MATα ura3 trp1 his3 LEU2::pLexAop1-LEU2). Yeast cells were grown in synthetic complete medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and histidine as necessary to select for the presence of various plasmids and containing 2% raffinose to A 600 = 0.2. Cultures were induced with galactose to a final concentration of 2% for 6 h. 100 μl of the cells were lysed in 0.1 ml of Z-buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNa2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and 3.5 units of lyticase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h in 96-well plates. To assay β-galactosidase activity, 50 μl ofo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (4 mg/ml) in Z-buffer were added to the reaction, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 1 m NaOH. The absorbance of the reaction was measured at A 420. Three colonies for each transformation were assayed in duplicates.Mammalian Transfection AssaysFor single transfections, mammalian 293 cells (2 × 105 cells/35-mm well) were transfected either with carrier DNA or with 3.5 μg of pCIneo, or pCIBax, or pCIBaxΔC+TM and 0.7 μg of CMV-β-gal (where CMV is cytomegalovirus and β-gal is β-galactosidase). For cotransfection experiments, cells were, in addition, transfected with either pCIBcl-2 or pCIBcl-2(G145A). The transfected cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, refed with fresh complete medium, and incubated overnight. 24 h after transfection, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde, and stained with 1 mg/ml X-gal solution. Blue cells were counted as either viable (flat with normal epithelial shape) or dead (rounded and shrunken).DISCUSSIONWe have utilized a strategy of random mutagenesis and yeast two-hybrid analysis to identify mutants of Bax that regain the ability to bind the inactive Bcl-2(G145A) protein. A similar strategy had previously been used to isolate mutants of Raf-1 that complement inactivating Ras mutations (27White M.A. Nicolette C. Minden A. Polverino A. Aelst L.V. Karin M. Wigler M.H. Cell. 1995; 80: 533-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). These methods represent a general approach for probing the structural requirements for protein-protein interactions.A panel of Bax mutants that bound to Bcl-2(G145A) was isolated, and they all coded for truncated Bax proteins that included the BH3 domain but lacked complete BH1 and BH2 domains. These results are in accord with previous studies indicating that the BH3 domain in Bax is responsible for the binding of Bax to Bcl-2 (23Zha H. Aimé-Sempé C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7440-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The fact that full-length Bax fails to bind Bcl-2(G145A) but that truncated Bax does bind has interesting structural implications. The results demonstrate that the G145A mutation in Bcl-2 does not destroy the binding site for BH3 domains. This conclusion is further supported by our observation that Bcl-2(G145A) can form a homodimer (Fig. 1, A andB) since our previous work has shown that Bcl-2 homodimerization is a BH3-dependent interaction (21Diaz J.-L. Oltersdorf T. Horne W. McConnell M. Wilson G. Weeks S. Garcia T. Fritz L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11350-11355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, the data suggest a model in which the BH3 domain in wild-type Bax is constrained in such a way that it cannot fit into the binding groove of the Bcl-2(G145A) or Bcl-xL(G138A) mutant. In this model, when conformational constraints are released by C-terminal Bax truncation, binding can occur (Fig. 8). Similarly, other mutations such as Bcl-xL(F131V,D133A) and Bcl-xL(G148E,G187A) cannot bind the constrained BH3 domain of wild-type Bax, but are capable of binding the presumably more flexible truncated molecule.The Bax mutants isolated in our screen all contained intact BH3 domains, but lacked most or all of the BH1/BH2 region. Interestingly, two naturally occurring proteins, Bik (22Chittenden T. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Ebb R.G. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Chinnadurai G. Lutz R.J.

Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), that also contain only the BH3 domain have been described. Like Bax and BaxΔC+TM, Bik and Bid are also inducers of cell death (29Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B. Malstrom S. Avery B.J. Ebb R.G. Subramanian T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Chinnadurai G. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1921-1928PubMed Google Scholar, 30Han J. Sabbatini P. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 31Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The existence of Bax-like molecules lacking BH1 and BH2 domains presents the possibility that these molecules may have binding properties that are distinct from those of wild-type Bax and that resemble the mutant truncated Bax molecules described here. If so, cell survival functions retained by mutants Bcl-xL(F131V,D133A) and Bcl-xL(G148E,G187A) (24Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar) could be due in part to their ability to bind death-inducing family members that contain only BH3 domains, even though these mutants do not interact with Bax or Bak.It has not been clearly established whether the cell-protective Bcl-2 family members or the death-inducing family members are the key molecules that interface with the downstream death effector elements in the cell. Data exist to support the hypothesis that the pro-survival members have intrinsic anti-apoptotic activity that is antagonized by the death-promoting members (24Cheng E.H.-Y. Levine B. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Hardwick J.M. Nature. 1996; 379: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Such anti-apoptotic activity may be related to the binding of death effector molecules (32Spector M.S. Desnoyers S. Hoeppner D.J. Hengartner M.O. Nature. 1997; 385: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 33Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Lane B.R. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 275: 1122-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 34Wu D. Wallen H.D. Nuñez G. Science. 1997; 275: 1126-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) or to effects on ion homeostasis (35Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). However, other data support the idea that the death-inducing family members actively promote apoptosis and that this activity is antagonized by the pro-survival members (31Wang K. Yin X.-M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 36Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Additional data can be interpreted to support the heterodimer as the active molecular species (37Knudson C.M. Tung K.S.K. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that the normally inactive Bcl-2(G145A) mutant can suppress cell death induced by BaxΔC+TM. Since this Bcl-2 mutant has no intrinsic anti-apoptotic activity, its observed cellular effect must be due to binding and inactivating the BaxΔC+TM molecule. Thus, a Bcl-2 family member can have cell survival effects strictly by passive sequestration of a death-promoting family member. The bcl-2 gene family encodes proteins that regulate programmed cell death (1Nuñez G. Clarke M.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 399-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 2Reed J.C. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). For example, in the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, the bcl-2 homologueced-9 acts to inhibit developmental cell deaths. This is evidenced by the elevated levels of cell death that characterize the embryos of loss-of-function ced-9 mutants (3Hengartner M.E. Ellis R.E. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1992; 356: 494-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 4Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 665-676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Similarly, in cultured mammalian cells, apoptosis is inhibited by the expression of several family members, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1 (5Hockenbery D.M. Nuñez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3522) Google Scholar, 6Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G.

Furthermore, gene ablation experiments in mice have further confirmed the anti-apoptotic effects of bcl-2 andbcl-x (9Veis D.J. Sorenson C.M. Shutter J.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar, 10Motoyama N. Wang F. Roth K.A. Sawa H. Nakayama K. Negishi I. Senju S. Zhang Q. Fujii S. Loh D.Y. Science. 1995; 267: 1506-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). In contrast to the anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, mammalian cells also express family members that promote apoptosis. For example, Bax and Bak have been shown to kill when overexpressed in mammalian cells and can antagonize the cell-protective functions of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (11Oltvai Z. Milliman C. Korsmeyer S.J.

While the mechanisms by which Bcl-2 family members modulate cell death remain unclear, a variety of studies indicate that many of the family members can interact with each other and that these interactions are functionally important. Immunoprecipitation studies using genetically engineered cells first demonstrated that members of the Bcl-2 family can form protein-protein dimers with each other. These studies demonstrated that the Bcl-2 molecule can form a heterodimer with Bax and can also form a homodimer with another Bcl-2 molecule (11Oltvai Z. Milliman C. Korsmeyer S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2076304758,"Two major types of cleavage sites with different sequence preferences have been proposed for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proteinase. To understand the nature of these sequence preferences better, single and multiple amino acid substitutions were introduced into a type 1 cleavage site peptide, thus changing it to a naturally occurring type 2 cleavage site sequence. Our results indicated that the previous classification of the retroviral cleavage sites may not be generally valid and that the preference for a residue at a particular position in the substrate depends strongly on the neighboring residues, including both those at the same side and at the opposite side of the peptide backbone of the substrate. Based on these results, pseudosymmetric (palindromic) substrates were designed. The retroviral proteinases are symmetrical dimers of two identical subunits; however, the residues of naturally occurring cleavage sites do not show symmetrical arrangements, and no obvious symmetrical substrate preference has been observed for the specificity of HIV proteinase. To examine the role of the asymmetry created by the peptide bonds on the specificity of the respective primed and nonprimed halves of the binding site, amino acid substitutions were introduced into a palindromic sequence. In general, the results suggested that the asymmetry does not result in substantial differences in specificity of the S3 and S3' subsites, whereas its effect is more pronounced for the S2 and S2' subsites. Although it was possible to design several good palindromic substrates, asymmetrical arrangements may be preferred by the HIV proteinase."

After synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum, class II molecules associate with a third chain, the invariant chain (Ii) (1Kvist S. Wiman K. Claesson L. Peterson P.A. Dobberstein B.

This structure has been proposed to be the location where class II molecules acquire peptides, but the actual evidence that peptide loading occurs preferentially in the MIIC is circumstantial and other endosomal compartments containing early and late endosomal markers have also been suggested to be compartments where class II-peptide association may occur (9Amigorena S.

Membrane proteins can be sorted for delivery to the endosomal/lysosomal system in two cellular locations; from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and from the plasma membrane (12Sandoval I.V. Bakke O. Trends Cell. Biol. 1994; 4: 292-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 13Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). In both cases clathrin-coated vesicles are part of the sorting machineries, but the associated adaptor complexes are distinct in the two locations (14Ahle S. Mann A. Eichelsbacher U. Ungewickell E.

Thus AP1 is necessary for sorting and clathrin-coated pit assembly in the TGN, while AP2 has the same function at the plasma membrane. Although adaptor proteins from both complexes have been reported to bind lysosomal targeting signals, the sorting specificities of the two adaptor complexes are likely to be different (16Glickman J.N.

These motifs can clearly mediate internalization from the plasma membrane, but whether Ii sorting is occurring mainly in the TGN or at the cell surface under normal conditions is unclear.

Med. 1995; 182: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), while other reports have come to the conclusion that a large part of Ii-class II complexes reach the endosomal system via the cell surface (11Castellino F. Germain R.N. Immunity. 1995; 2: 73-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The small number of Ii-class II complexes present at the cell surface at steady state has made it difficult to determine the relative importance of these pathways. In this study we have used HeLa cells stably transfected with a dominant negative form of dynamin, K44A, under an inducible promoter (23Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar) to study the intracellular transport pathways of Ii and Ii-class II complexes. Dynamin is a cytosolic GTPase which is required for the formation of constricted clathrin-coated pits at the plasma membrane (24van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Cells which express the K44A form of dynamin accumulate elongated clathrin-coated pits, but are unable to form clathrin-coated vesicles and are thus incapable of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Since dynamin is not required either for transport in the secretory pathway or for the clathrin-mediated vesicular transport from the TGN to the endosomal system (23Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar), the use of dynamin-mutant cells provides an opportunity to address the question where endosomal sorting of Ii occurs. Although HeLa cells are not antigen presenting cells and do not normally express MHC class II molecules or Ii, transfected class II molecules are sorted to endosomal/lysosomal compartments in cells expressing class II and Ii (7Karlsson L. Peleraux A. Lindstedt R. Liljedahl M. Peterson P.A. Science. 1994; 266: 1569-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Simonsen A. Momburg F. Drexler J. Hammerling G.J. Bakke O. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 903-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the presence of the mutant form of dynamin we found that Ii, as well as Ii-class II complexes, accumulated at the cell surface, while only a minor amount of Ii appeared to reach the endosomal system. Our data suggest that in HeLa cells the sorting of Ii-class II complexes for delivery to the endosomal system occurs mainly at the cell surface, rather than in the TGN. The stable tTA-HeLa cell line with tetracycline-regulated expression of dynamin mutant K44A was provided by Sandra Schmid (23Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids for HLA DRA, DRB, human Iip31, Iip41, and Iip31(AA-AA) have been described (19Pond L. Kuhn L.A.

Iip41(AA-AA) was generated by replacing aBsrGI-MunI fragment in the Iip31(AA-AA) plasmid with the corresponding fragment from a Iip41 plasmid. Human CD8α and mouse CD40 were cloned in the expression vector pCMU. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) Bü45 was purchased from Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ). The hybridoma lines DA6.147 (27Guy K. Heyningen V.V. Cohen B.B. Deane D.L. Steel C.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1982; 12: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and OKT8 (28Hoffman R.A. Kung P.C. Hansen W.P. Goldstein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 4914-4917Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) have been described. Rabbit antiserum K456 was raised against purified mouse CD40Fc fusion protein. Fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Texas Red-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). K44A-transfected tTA-HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 400 μg/ml G418, 200 μg/ml puromycin, and 2 μg/ml tetracycline (tet). Expression of the dynamin mutant, K44A, was induced by removing tetracycline from the medium. Cells were split 6 h prior to transfection, then changed to either tetracycline-containing DMEM or DMEM without tetracycline 2 h prior to transfection. 25 μg of plasmids in various combinations were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation (29Nilsson T. Jackson M.R. Peterson P.A. Cell. 1989; 58: 707-718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Cells were analyzed 72 h after transfection. Transfected cells were detached from the dishes with 2 mm EDTA in PBS. Cells were stained with mAbs in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as secondary reagent. Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson LYSIS II instrument. Cells on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. Antibody incubations were done in PBS with 0.2% saponin and 0.6% fish skin gelatin for permeabilized staining or with 0.6% gelatin only for non-permeabilized staining. Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss axiophot microscope. Cells on coverslips were incubated with mAb Bü45 diluted in medium for 30 min on ice, then washed before being returned to DMEM with or without tetracycline. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, then fixed and stained as described above with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. Cells were also co-stained with K456 followed by Texas Red-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. Cells were incubated in methionine-free DMEM for 15 min prior to labeling, then labeled for 30 min with 0.2 mCi of [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN) in methionine-free DMEM. Cells were lysed immediately or incubated in methionine-containing medium with or without tetracycline for various times at 37 °C. When leupeptin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used, 250 μg/ml was included in the chase medium. Cells were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS with protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture Tablets, Boehringer Mannheim). Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) then incubated with mAb DA6.147 at 4 °C for 2 h before addition of protein A-Sepharose. The beads were washed 5 times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. The precipitates were boiled in SDS sample buffer before being applied to 10–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed and dried before autoradiography or PhosphorImager Scanning (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Autoradiographs were scanned using an Agfa ArcusII scanner and composites were printed on a Kodak XLS 8600 PS printer. Cells were washed and incubated with sulfo-NHS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml) (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed with serum-free DMEM and ice-cold PBS then lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 with protease inhibitors. Ii-class II complexes were immunoprecipitated as above. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to BA-S 85 filters (Schleicher and Schuell) by electroblotting. Blocking was done with 5% dry milk in TBST (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin. After washing, the filter was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (0.33 mg/ml) and nitro blue tetrazolium (0.16 mg/ml) (Promega) in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mmMgCl2. To determine whether invariant chain localization was dependent on dynamin function we transiently transfected wild-type or targeting-deficient forms of invariant chain (Iip31 or Iip31AA-AA) into HeLa cells stably transfected with the K44A dynamin mutant under a tetracycline-regulated promoter. Overexpression of proteins with endosomal or lysosomal targeting motifs has been reported to result in mis-sorting and accumulation of transfected and endogenous lysosomal proteins at the plasma membrane (30Harter C. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 311-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 31Marks M.S. Woodruff L. Ohno H. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 341-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). To avoid this problem a moderately strong α-globin promoter was used to control the expression of Ii. The cells were grown in the presence of tetracycline (to suppress K44A expression) or in the absence of tetracycline (to induce K44A expression). 72 h after transfection the cell surface expression of invariant chain was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with mAb Bü45. Fig. 1 A shows that in the presence of tetracycline (+tet) only a small amount of Ii could be detected at the cell surface, suggesting that the capacity for Ii sorting was not exceeded. In contrast, the cell surface expression in the absence of tetracycline (−tet) was similar to the level of cells transfected with the targeting-deficient form of Ii (Fig. 1 B). In the latter case the presence or absence of tetracycline did not influence the cell surface levels of Ii. Staining of a cotransfected control molecule, human CD8α, was similar in the different transfections and was not affected by the expression of the mutant dynamin (not shown). This experiment shows that if dynamin function is blocked, Ii accumulates at the cell surface.Figure 2Dynamin-dependent internalization of Ii from the cell surface. K44A-transfected HeLa cells were transfected with Iip31 and CD40 in the presence (a, b, c,and d) or absence (e, f, g, and h) of tetracycline. Ii at the cell surface was labeled with mAb Bü45 on ice. Cells were transferred to 37 °C for 1 h before fixation, then either permeabilized (perm +)(a, b, e, andf) or left non-permeabilized (perm −-)(c, d, g, and h). Ii was detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (a, c, e, andg). The subcellular localization of CD40 was detected with rabbit antiserum K456 followed by Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (b, d, f, and h).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 1Cell surface expression of Ii in K44A-expressing cells.

The cell surface Ii was stained with Bü45 and analyzed by flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the uptake of Ii from the cell surface in the presence or absence of mutant dynamin. Cells transfected with Ii and CD40 (as a cell surface control) were plated on coverslips and these were incubated on ice with mAb Bü45. After washing, the cells were allowed to internalize the bound antibodies for 1 h in complete medium at 37 °C. Cells were then fixed and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG before or after permeabilization. The cells were also co-stained with a rabbit antiserum directed against CD40, followed by Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. The stained cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fig.2 a shows the distinct vesicular staining of non-induced cells after permeabilization. When the cells were not permeabilized, Ii staining could not be detected (Fig. 2 c), indicating that Bü45 which had bound to the cell surface had been internalized. CD40 staining was present at the cell surface whether the cells had been permeabilized or not (Fig. 2, b andd). When cells expressing the dynamin mutant were analyzed for Ii expression, considerable cell surface expression of Ii was detected. The Ii staining pattern after permeabilization (Fig.2 e) was not significantly different from the pattern seen in the non-permeabilized cells (Fig. 2 g) and in both cases the staining was largely coincident with the CD40 control staining (Fig. 2,f and h). The shape of K44A-expressing cells is different from non-induced cells, probably due to the accumulation of coated pits which are unable to pinch off to form vesicles (23Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Molecules which are normally internalized are concentrated in these pits, thus giving a dotty cell surface staining pattern. The data from these experiments show that Ii internalization from the cell surface depends on the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. The subcellular distribution of Ii under steady state conditions was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence of cells transfected with Ii and CD40 cDNAs. Staining of permeabilized non-induced cells with mAb Bü45 showed Ii to be localized intracellularly in reticular and vesicular structures (Fig.3 A, a). Staining of non-permeabilized cells showed that little if any Ii was located at the cell surface (Fig. 3 A, c). CD40 staining was detectable at the cell surface in both cases (Fig. 3 A,b and d). When K44A expressing cells were stained with mAb Bü45, Ii could only be detected at the cell surface (coincident with the CD40-staining), whether the cells were permeabilized or not (Fig. 3 A, e andg). No vesicular staining was seen in the permeabilized cells, suggesting that a large part of Ii was located at the plasma membrane. Immunofluorescence staining of cells transfected with Iip41 showed that this form of Ii, like Iip31, accumulated at the cell surface in K44A expressing cells (compare Fig. 3, B, panel a, with A, panel b). Since dynamin only affects internalization from the cell surface, the accumulation of Ii in this location suggested that a fraction of the transported invariant chain was delivered to the cell surface before it was internalized into endosomes. To determine if the intracellular transport and maturation of Ii-class II complexes were similarly affected by the expression of mutant dynamin, we made pulse-chase experiments using non-induced or induced K44A HeLa cells transiently transfected with Iip41, HLA-DRA, and HLA-DRB. Delivery to the endosomal system is required for dissociation of Ii from class II molecules since this process is dependent on both acidic pH and proteolysis (32Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3975-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 33Nowell J. Quaranta V. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1371-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 34Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Karp D.R. Pinet V. Bakke O. Long E.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2841-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the degree of Ii dissociation from class II molecules can be used as an indirect measure of the delivery of Ii-class II complexes to the endosomal system. Iip41 was used in these transfections instead of Iip31, since it is easier to distinguish from the class II α and β chains in SDS-PAGE gels due to its larger size. The two forms of Ii appear to be equally efficient in promoting class II folding and targeting, although they may influence Ii and antigen degradation in different ways (35Takaesu N.T. Lower J.A. Yelon D. Robertson E.J. Bikoff E.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 187-199PubMed Google Scholar,36Bevec T. Stoka V. Pungercic G. Dolenc I. Turk V. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Non-induced or induced transfected cells were labeled for 30 min then washed and either lysed immediately or chased in non-radioactive medium as indicated. Radiolabeled class II molecules were immunoprecipitated from the lysates using mAb DA6.147, reactive with DRα, before analysis by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 4 A shows that in non-induced cells (i.e. +tet) class II molecules were associated with Ii after the pulse labeling and after the early chase time points. Both the DR chains and Ii (p41+) acquired carbohydrate modifications during the chase (as indicated by their slower migration), indicating that the chains were transported as expected. The amount of co-precipitated Ii decreased after 2 h of chase and after 6 h of chase essentially no Ii was detectable in the precipitate. When class II molecules were immunoprecipitated from the cells expressing K44A dynamin we found that the association of DR with Ii, as well as the acquisition of carbohydrate modifications, were very similar in the induced and the non-induced cells (Fig. 4 A, −tet). In contrast, the dissociation of Ii from the class II molecules was markedly delayed and after 8 h of chase the amount of co-precipitated Ii which had acquired carbohydrate modifications (Iip41+) was only slightly decreased (Fig. 4, A andB). The slow dissociation of the DR-Ii complexes was similar to the slow dissociation of DR molecules from mutated forms of Ii lacking endosomal targeting information, where the DR-Ii complexes accumulate at the cell surface (Ref. 34Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Karp D.R. Pinet V. Bakke O. Long E.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2841-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, and data not shown). Although the majority of Ii was not delivered to endosomes in the presence of the mutant dynamin, it was not clear to what extent Ii-class II complexes did reach the endosomal system, since the protease sensitivity of Ii results in rapid degradation after arrival in these compartments. To estimate the endosomal delivery of Ii-class II complexes in the absence or presence of the mutant dynamin, we took advantage of the fact that in the presence of the protease inhibitor leupeptin invariant chain degradation is partly inhibited (32Blum J.S. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3975-3979Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The resulting Ii-derived fragments, LIP (leupeptin-induced proteins) migrating at 21–23 kDa and SLIP (smallleupeptin-induced proteins) migrating at 12 kDa, remain associated with class II molecules in the endosomal system (37Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 38Newcomb J.R. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4153-4163PubMed Google Scholar). The relative abundance of the two fragments appear to vary depending on experimental conditions. To quantify the amount of Ii-class II complexes that did reach the endosomal system we made pulse-chase experiment as above, but included leupeptin in the chase medium. Fig. 5 shows that in the non-induced cells (i.e. +tet), a distinct LIP fragment was present in the immunoprecipitates from leupeptin-treated cells after 8 h of chase. No distinct SLIP fragment could be detected. The immunoprecipitates from the induced cells (−tet) showed, as expected, that most of the Ii was still intact. However, a small amount of LIP could be detected after 8 h of chase also in this case. Quantification by PhosphorImager analysis showed that the LIP fragment constituted 80% of the total transported invariant chain remaining after 8 h in the non-induced cells (after compensating for the lower number of methionines in the LIP fragment; 9 versus 13) while it constituted 18% in the induced cells. Comparison with the amount of Ii precipitated after 1 h of chase showed that only a minor amount of Ii was unaccounted for in the leupeptin-treated cells. This experiment shows that some Ii-class II complexes reached the endosomal system in the presence of mutant dynamin, although the majority of complexes did not. Internalization of Ii was blocked by K44A expression and it was therefore likely that the slow dissociation of Ii from DR in the K44A expressing cells was a reflection of the blocked internalization from the plasma membrane, leading to accumulation of DR-Ii complexes at the cell surface. To verify that this was the case we analyzed the cell surface expression of cells transfected with DRA, DRB, and either wild-type Iip41 or Iip41(AA-AA), which lacks endosomal targeting information. 72 h after transfection, the cell surface proteins of induced or non-induced cells were labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin. After lysis, DR molecules were immunoprecipitated with DA6.147, as above. The samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels, then blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. Immunoprecipitated proteins labeled with biotin residues (i.e. molecules derived from the cell surface) were detected using alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin in combination with a colorimetric substrate. Fig. 6 shows that little Ii was coprecipitated with the cell surface DR molecules from the non-induced cells transfected with wild-type Ii and DR (Fig.6, lane 1). In contrast, most of the cell surface DR molecules derived from the K44A-expressing cells were associated with Ii (Fig. 6, lane 2). Cell surface DR molecules were also associated with Ii in the cells transfected with Iip41(AA-AA), whether K44A was expressed (not shown) or not (Fig. 6, lane 3). Thus, deficient internalization due to expression of the mutant dynamin results in accumulation of Ii-class II complexes at the plasma membrane. It is a well accepted fact that MHC class II molecules acquire peptides in endosomal or lysosomal compartments, although the exact location where peptide loading occurs is debated. Several studies have tried to establish whether Ii-class II complexes reach these loading compartments directly from the TGN or whether they are delivered to the endosomal system via the cell surface. Studies based on immunoelectron microscopy and subcellular fractionation as well as the use of inhibitors of proteolysis or endosomal acidification have concluded that the majority of Ii-class II complexes are delivered directly to the endosomal/lysosomal system MIIC (5Peters P.J. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Ploegh H.L. Geuze H.J. Nature. 1991; 349: 669-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 20Benaroch P. Yilla M. Raposo G. Ito K. Miwa K. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 21Peters P.J. Raposo G. Neefjes J.J. Oorschot V. Leijendekker R.L. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 37Neefjes J.J. Ploegh H.L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Other reports using internalization experiments and biochemical methods have come to the opposite conclusion, that a large part of Ii-class II complexes reach the endosomal system via the cell surface (11Castellino F. Germain R.N. Immunity. 1995; 2: 73-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 22Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Stang E. Bakke O. Long E.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8581-8585Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 39Warmerdam P.A.M. Long E.O. Roche P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Cell type-dependent differences both in peptide-loading requirements and in intracellular transport of class II molecules may explain some of the differing results, but it appears likely that the methods used to address this question influence the conclusions reached. The subcellular distribution of proteins at steady state is a reflection of how long they dwell in different compartments as well as the sizes of the compartments. Rapid transit of molecules via the cell surface or through a certain compartment may not allow detection by morphological methods, especially if the compartment is large. Pulse-chase labelings and subcellular fractionation are unlikely to distinguish transiently occupied compartments in the later part of the secretory pathway or in the endosomal system, both due to the poor resolution of subcellular fractionation methods, and due to the fact that even a small cohort of labeled molecules created during a short pulse labeling will have become spread out by the time the molecules reach the later stages of the secretory pathway. In this study we have addressed the question of how Ii-class II complexes travel to endosomes by taking advantage of the fact that formation of clathrin-coated vesicles during endocytosis from the cell surface require the function of the cytosolic GTPase dynamin, whereas formation of clathrin-coated vesicles from the TGN does not. HeLa cells stably transfected with a dominant negative form of dynamin (K44A) expressed under the control of a tightly regulated inducible promoter have previously been well characterized (23Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Expression of the K44A dynamin blocks receptor-mediated endocytosis from the cell surface, apparently without disturbing the vesicular transport from the TGN to endosomes. Delivery of the lysosomal protease cathepsin D is normal in these cells and the distributions of cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and γ-adaptin (which is part of the TGN-specific AP1 complex) have normal distributions (Ref. 23Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar and not shown). Using transiently transfected K44A-expressing HeLa cells we found that Ii internalization from the cell surface was dependent on the function of normal dynamin and that most Ii molecules as well as Ii-class II complexes were delivered to the cell surface instead of the endosomal system. Pulse-chase experiments with K44A-expressing cells transfected with DR and Ii showed that the rate of invariant chain dissociation from DR molecules was very slow, with ≈80% of the transported Ii chains still associated with DR molecules after 8 h of chase. Ii is very sensitive to proteolytic degradation in the endosomal system and the slow rate of Ii dissociation suggested that the majority of Ii-class II complexes did not reach this system within 8 h of chase. Pulse-chase experiments with leupeptin-treated cells confirmed that under these conditions <20% of Ii-class II complexes did enter endosomal compartments where Ii degradation could occur. Analysis of cell surface molecules in the same transfectants showed that most DR molecules at the plasma membrane were indeed associated with Ii. The fraction of Ii-class II complexes that did reach the endosomal system may represent material directly transported from the TGN to endosomes. Alternatively, endocytosis of Ii-class II complexes from the cell surface was not totally blocked, either because the mutant dynamin may not completely block the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles or because some Ii-class II complexes may be internalized in non-clathrin-coated vesicles. Clathrin-independent pinocytosis of fluid phase markers is increased in cells where dynamin function is inhibited (40Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although the intracellular transport of transfected Ii-class II complexes, as well as Ii dissociation and final subcellular distribution of class II molecules, is similar in HeLa cells to what has been reported for both B lymphoblastoid cell lines and different types of transfected cell lines (1Kvist S. Wiman K. Claesson L. Peterson P.A. Dobberstein B. Cell. 1982; 29: 61-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 34Roche P.A. Teletski C.L. Karp D.R. Pinet V. Bakke O. Long E.O.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30318-30321Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), HeLa cells are not normally antigen presenting cells and we cannot conclude that a majority of Ii-class II complexes reach endosomal and lysosomal compartments via the cell surface also in professional antigen presenting cells. It is apparent, however, that difficulty to detect a substantial amount of Ii-class II complexes at the plasma membrane does not allow the conclusion that a majority of these complexes reach the endosomal system via a direct pathway from the TGN. The route of transport to the endosomal system may matter in the case of class II molecules since both lysosomal compartments and lighter compartments containing early endosome markers have been indicated in peptide loading (8Pierre P.

Internalization of Ii-class II complexes together with antigenic proteins from the cell surface may allow the most extensive contact between class II molecules and internalized antigens, thus increasing the chances that class II molecules will be able to bind and present some epitope from a given protein. In conclusion, we have used a new experimental approach to analyze the intracellular transport of Ii-class II complexes. We find that in transfected HeLa cells a majority of Ii-class II complexes, as well as of free Ii reach the endosomal system via the plasma membrane. This approach shows that the ability to specifically control different steps in membrane trafficking using other dominant negative molecules (for example, Rabs) is potentially useful for elucidating where class II molecules acquire peptides and how peptide-loaded class II molecules return to the plasma membrane.

RNase protection, primer extension, and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis of a rat cosmid clone containing the entire m1 gene demonstrated that the rat m1 gene consists of a single 657-base pairs (bp) non-coding exon separated by a 13.5-kilobase (kb) intron from a 2.54-kb coding exon that contains the entire open reading frame. The splice acceptor for the coding exon starting at −71 bp relative to the adenine of the initiating methionine. This genomic structure is similar to that of the m4 gene (Wood, I. C., Roopra, A., Harrington, C. A., and Buckley, N. J. (1995)J. Biol. Chem. 270, 30933–30940 and Wood, I. C., Roopra, A., and Buckley, N. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem.271, 14221–14225). Like the m4 gene, the m1 promoter lacks TATA and CAAT consensus motifs, and the first exon and 5′-flanking region are not gc-rich. The 5′-flanking region also contains the consensus regulatory elements Sp-1, NZF-1, AP-1, AP-2, E-box, NFκB, and Oct-1. Unike the m4 promoter, there is no evidence of a RE1/NRSE silencer element in the m1 promoter. Deletional analysis and transient transfection assays demonstrates that reporter constructs containing 0.9 kb of 5′-flanking sequence and the first exon are sufficient to drive cell-specific expression of reporter gene in IMR32 neuroblastoma cells while remaining silent in 3T3 fibrobasts."
https://openalex.org/W2013791336,"Myosin heavy chain kinase A (MHCK A) participates in the regulation of cytoskeletal myosin assembly inDictyostelium, driving filament disassembly via phosphorylation of sites in the myosin tail. MHCK A contains an amino-terminal coiled-coil domain, a novel central catalytic domain, and a carboxyl-terminal domain containing a 7-fold WD repeat motif. We have overexpressed MHCK A truncation constructs to clarify the roles of each of these domains. Recombinant full-length MHCK A, MHCK A lacking the predicted coiled-coil domain, and MHCK A lacking the WD repeat domain were expressed at high levels in Dictyostelium cells lacking endogenous MHCK A. Biochemical analysis of the purified proteins demonstrates that the putative coiled-coil domain is responsible for the oligomerization of the MHCK A holoenzyme. Removal of the WD repeat domain had no effect on catalytic activity toward a synthetic peptide, but did result in a 95% loss of protein kinase activity when native myosin filaments were used as the substrate. Cellular analysis confirms that the same severe loss of activity against myosin occurs in vivo when the WD repeat domain is eliminated. These results suggest that the WD repeat domain of MHCK A serves to target this enzyme to its physiological substrate.

Conventional myosin (myosin II) is involved in a wide range of contractile events in eukaryotic cells. In Dictyostelium, genetic and cellular analyses have demonstrated roles for myosin in the maintenance of cortical tension, cytokinesis, morphogenesis, capping of receptors, and cell locomotion (1De Lozanne A.

Although the roles of myosin II appear similar in many cell types, the in vivo mechanisms regulating myosin II assembly and activity in nonmuscle cells are not well understood.Assembly of Dictyostelium myosin II bipolar filaments can be regulated by phosphorylation on the myosin II heavy chain (MHC). 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, myosin II heavy chain; MHCK, MHC kinase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. 1The abbreviations used are: MHC, myosin II heavy chain; MHCK, MHC kinase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. Two distinct MHC kinases (MHCKs) have been purified and cloned from Dictyostelium. A 130-kDa MHCK (MHCK A), discussed below, is expressed during both growth and development. An 84-kDa MHCK that is expressed only during development appears to contain two distinct catalytic domains, one related to protein kinase C (6Ravid S. Spudich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15144-15150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ravid S. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1987; 262: 1065-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and one related to diacylglycerol kinases (9Thanos C.D. Bowie J.U. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 782-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Both MHCKs are capable of phosphorylating threonine residues on the myosin tail and can drive myosin bipolar filament disassembly in vitro. A third kinase, related to MHCK A, has recently been cloned from Dictyostelium (10Clancy C.E. Mendoza M.G. Naismith T.V. Kolman M.F. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11812-11815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but is has not yet been established whether this protein regulates myosin assembly in vivo. Thein vitro target sites of MHCK A have been mapped to threonines 1823, 1833, and 2029 in the tail region of the MHC (11Luck-Vielmetter D. Schleicher M. Grabatin B. Wippler J. Gerisch G. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Vaillancourt J.P. Lyons C. Côté G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10082-10087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of these sites was demonstrated by mutating the sites either to alanine (3X ALA myosin) to create a nonphosphorylatable MHC or to aspartic acid (3X ASP myosin) to mimic phosphorylated MHC (13Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In vivo, cells expressing 3X ALA myosin display severe myosin II overassembly in the cytoskeleton, whereas cells expressing 3X ASP myosin display severely reduced myosin II assembly in the cytoskeleton, resulting in a block in cytokinesis and development. The 3X ASP cells are also unable to complete development. In all tested assays, the 3X ASP cells are phenotypically identical to MHC null cells (mhc −). These studies indicate that the MHCK A target sites play a critical role in regulated myosin II assembly in vitro and that filament assembly is required for myosin function in vivo.Subsequent cellular analysis of Dictyostelium MHCK A null cells (mhck A −) and overexpressing cell lines (MHCK A+) indicated that MHCK A regulates the cytoskeletal myosin II assembly level during both growth and development (14Kolman M.F. Futey L.M. Egelhoff T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Themhck A − cells are viable, but display partial overassembly of myosin II in the cytoskeleton. MHCK A+cells display reduced myosin II assembly in the cytoskeleton and reduced efficiency of growth in suspension and fail to complete development. The MHCK A+ cell phenotype resembles those of the mhc − cells and the 3X ASP cell lines, indicating that overexpressed MHCK A can drive myosin filament disassembly in vivo.Molecular analysis of the MHCK A sequence (15Futey L.M. Medley Q.G. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) indicates that it has an amino-terminal domain that is predicted to have an α-helical coiled-coil structure, a catalytic domain that is not related to conventional protein kinases, and a carboxyl-terminal domain that contains the 7-fold WD repeat motif (16Neer E.J.

MHCK A is activated 50-fold by autophosphorylation (18Medley Q.G. Gariepy J. Côté G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8992-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and autophosphorylation is increased by polyanions such as DNA, heparin, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol (19Medley Q.G.

This novel group includes mammalian elongation factor-2 kinase, also known as calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase III. Given its novel structure and catalytic domain, we have performed a structure-function dissection of MHCK A to identify the biochemical and physiological roles of the domains that flank the catalytic domain. The results reported here indicate that the amino-terminal coiled-coil domain is responsible for MHCK A oligomerization and that the WD repeats are important for full activity against native myosin II.RESULTSExpression of MHCK A ConstructsA schematic representation of full-length MHCK A and constructs in which the amino-terminal coiled-coil (ΔCoil-MHCK A) or the carboxyl-terminal WD repeat (ΔWD-MHCK A) domains were truncated are shown in Fig. 1. The three MHCK A constructs were overexpressed in the Dictyostelium mhck A − cell line by fusing each cDNA segment to an actin-15 promoter in an extrachromosomal vector. Once established, transfected cell lines were maintained in a 50 μg/ml concentration of the selective antibiotic G418. This elevated G418 concentration resulted in significantly higher kinase expression (3–4-fold) relative to the previously described overexpression of full-length MHCK A (14Kolman M.F. Futey L.M. Egelhoff T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The expression of each kinase was quantified by phosphoimaging of Western blots performed with MHCK A polyclonal antibodies and 125I-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody using each of the three purified proteins (described below) to generate a standard curve for each corresponding cell line, including wild-type cells. Calculations were performed using this Western blot analysis to generate estimates of the in vivoexpression levels of each recombinant kinase construct. Based upon this analysis, recombinant full-length MHCK A is expressed at 27 μm, ΔCoil-MHCK A is expressed at 46 μm, and ΔWD-MHCK A is expressed at 90 μm. MHCK A expression in the parental cell line JH10 was calculated to be 0.3 μm. These expression levels represent 90- and 153-fold overexpression of recombinant full-length MHCK A and ΔCoil-MHCK A, respectively, and 300-fold overexpression of ΔWD-MHCK A relative to that of MHCK A in the parental cell line (Fig. 1). By comparison, we calculate myosin II in Dictyostelium to be ∼6 μm.CytokinesisPrevious studies have demonstrated that myosin II is essential for cytokinesis as assayed by growth of cells in suspension cultures (1De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar).mhc − cells are unable to form a contractile ring, which results in the cells becoming large and multinucleated without any increase in cell number (1De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 27Manstein D.J. Titus M.A. De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Similar phenotypes have been observed in 3X ASP cells and in MHCK A+ cells (13Egelhoff T.T. Lee R.J. Spudich J.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 363-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,14Kolman M.F. Futey L.M. Egelhoff T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We compared growth rates of MHCK A truncation cell lines in suspension cultures as an in vivo test of myosin function (Fig. 2 a). The mhck A − cell line, which was previously shown to grow at a similar rate compared with control cells (14Kolman M.F. Futey L.M. Egelhoff T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), was used as a control (filled circles). Cells that overexpress full-length MHCK A (filled squares) and ΔCoil-MHCK A (open squares) in the mhck A − cell line were unable to grow in suspension. These MHCK A+ and ΔCoil-MHCK A+ cells increased in size, were multinucleated, and eventually lysed under suspension culture conditions. In contrast, these cells grew at relatively normal rates when maintained as attached cells in plastic Petri dishes. Interestingly, when the WD repeats of MHCK A were removed (ΔWD-MHCK A+) (open circles), these cells grew at a similar rate and final density as mhck A −cells, indicating that myosin function was not impaired during cytokinesis. The ΔWD-MHCK A+ cells also displayed normal cell size during growth in suspension (data not shown).Figure 2a, suspension growth of cells expressing MHCK A truncation constructs. Cultures inoculated at 105cells/ml were grown in suspension in HL5 with 50 μg/ml G418 (themhck A − control cell line was transfected with vector pLittle for G418 resistance) and rotated at 200 rpm.b, synchronous morphogenesis of cells expressing MHCK A truncation constructs.

We therefore used development as anin vivo test for myosin function in the MHCK A truncation cell lines (Fig. 2 b). MHCK A+ cells and ΔCoil-MHCK A+ cells arrested at mound stage and were unable to complete development, whereas control (mhck A −) and ΔWD-MHCK A+ cells completed development and formed spores at normal rates.Overexpression of MHCK A and ΔCoil-MHCK A causes defects in myosin filament-dependent processes as assayed in vivoby cytokinesis and development, suggesting that these MHCK A constructs drive myosin filament disassembly in vivo. In contrast, no defects in cytokinesis or development were observed in the ΔWD-MHCK A cell line. Interestingly, ΔWD-MHCK A had the highest expression compared with the other MHCK A-expressing cell lines (Fig. 1), with 300-fold higher expression than wild-type cells. Lack of phenotypic defects in ΔWD-MHCK A+ cells therefore is not due to lower expression of the kinase. As reported previously (14Kolman M.F. Futey L.M. Egelhoff T.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), elevated MHC phosphorylation in crude cell lysates was observed in MHCK A+ cells. Similar behavior was observed in ΔCoil-MHCK A+ cells, whereas no detectable increase in MHC phosphorylation was observed in lysates of ΔWD-MHCK A+cells (data not shown).Elimination of Myosin-based Defects with 3X ALA MyosinFurther analysis was performed to confirm that the defects in cytokinesis and development in MHCK A+ and ΔCoil-MHCK A+ cell lines were due to phosphorylation of myosin II and disassembly of filaments. Cell lines were constructed in which either wild-type myosin or 3X ALA myosin was expressed in anmhc − background. The 3X ALA myosin bears mutations in the in vitro mapped target sites of MHCK A in the myosin II tail. This 3X ALA myosin is predicted to be resistant to disassembly in vivo by overexpressed MHCK A if the in vitro mapped target sites are also the physiologically relevantin vivo target sites. Clonal populations of these cells expressing either wild-type or 3X ALA MHC were transfected with cDNA encoding full-length mhck A or Δcoil-mhck A to test whether the 3X ALA myosin mutation relieves the defects induced by MHCK A or ΔCoil-MHCK A overexpression. When cDNA expressing MHCK A or ΔCoil-MHCK A was transfected into cells expressing wild-type myosin, they failed to grow in suspension (Fig.3 a, filled and open squares, respectively), as expected based upon results presented above. This defect in cytokinesis caused by overexpression of MHCK A or ΔCoil-MHCK A was eliminated in cells expressing 3X ALA myosin (Fig.3 a, filled and open triangles, respectively). Overexpression of MHCK A or ΔCoil-MHCK A in wild-type myosin cells caused the cells to become large and multinucleated in suspension culture, whereas 3X ALA myosin cell lines expressing these kinase constructs remained small and displayed no increase in size (Fig. 3 b) in suspension culture. In addition, wild-type MHC cells that overexpress either full-length MHCK A or ΔCoil-MHCK A constructs were not able to complete development and arrest at the mound stage, whereas 3X ALA MHC cells that overexpress either kinase construct were able to complete development (data not shown). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that full-length MHCK A and ΔCoil-MHCK A hyperphosphorylate myosin on residues 1823, 1833, and 2029 in vivo (or a subset of these residues), resulting in myosin disassembly and consequently an mhc −phenotype.Figure 3a, rescue of MHCK A+ or ΔCoil-MHCK A+ phenotypes with 3X ALA myosin. The cDNA encoding mhck A or Δcoil-mhck A was transfected into Dictyostelium cells expressing either wild-type MHC (WT) or nonphosphorylatable 3X ALA myosin. Cultures inoculated at 105 cells/ml were grown in suspension in HL5 with 50 μg/ml G418 and rotated at 200 rpm. b, micrographs of cells overexpressing either MHCK A or ΔCoil-MHCK A in cells containing either wild-type MHC or 3X ALA MHC. Notice that cells expressing MHCK A in a wild-type myosin II background are large and multinucleated, whereas cells expressing MHCK A in a 3X ALA myosin II background are not affected by MHCK A overexpression.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Purification of Full-length MHCK A, ΔCoil-MHCK A, and ΔWD-MHCK ATo determine the activity of each construct, the proteins were purified from Dictyostelium cultures. The previously reported purification method for MHCK A (26Medley Q.G. Lee S.F. Côté G.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was modified to allow purification of each MHCK A construct using four to five column steps. A summary of the purification of MHCK A constructs is found in TableI, and details on the purification of each MHCK A construct are given under “Experimental Procedures.” The purification table is presented as a guide to show relative purification during the purification process. A detailed comparison of the activities of the proteins under equivalent conditions is presented below. Fig. 4 shows purified MHCK A, ΔWD-MHCK A, and ΔCoil-MHCK A after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining (panel a) or Western blot analysis (panel b). MHCK A and ΔCoil-MHCK A ran at 130 and 73 kDa, respectively. ΔWD-MHCK A ran as a doublet at 96 and 90 kDa. This could represent autophosphorylation heterogeneity or a partial proteolytic clip. Both forms were recognized by polyclonal antisera, and both became radioactive in an autophosphorylation test performed with [γ-32P]ATP.Table IPurification of MHCK A truncations from DictyosteliumVolumeProteinSpecific activityTotal activitymlmgnmol/min/mgnmol/minMHCK A Total extract9021600.0365 Supernatant8012800.0452 DE52 supernatant806400.6384 Phosphocellulose22775385 Hydroxylapatite51845818 Sephacryl S-30023460238ΔCoil-MHCK A Total extract9020700.0362 Supernatant8015600.0347 DE52 supernatant1407420.3223 Phosphocellulose19721.6115 Hydroxylapatite5313.6112 Sephacryl S-3002294.944 Mono-S71.214.417ΔWD-MHCK A Total extract1202070 Supernatant10010000.0880 DE52 supernatant1704251.4595 Phosphocellulose431083.6388 Hydroxylapatite8216.2130 Sephacryl S-300181.3518.311 AH-Sepharose1-aAH-Sepharose, aminohexyl-Sepharose.2.50.25307.51-a AH-Sepharose, aminohexyl-Sepharose.

Gel filtration chromatography performed as the final or penultimate step in each purification allowed us to test the hypothesis that the amino-terminal domain of MHCK A (residues 1–500) is responsible for oligomerization. The gel filtration analysis of full-length MHCK A and truncation constructs is presented in Fig.5. Full-length MHCK A migrated at 130 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but under native conditions, gel-filtered in the void volume with an estimated molecular mass >1000 kDa. This is consistent with the 130-kDa protein being oligomeric. Rod-shaped protein domains such as coiled-coil helices gel filter with larger apparent mass that globular protein of equivalent size, so the number of MHCK A monomers in each oligomer cannot be estimated accurately from this elution behavior.Figure 5Gel filtration analysis of native molecular masses of MHCK A truncation constructs.

Elimination of the amino-terminal 500 amino acids caused ΔCoil-MHCK A to gel filter with an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted mass of 73 kDa. These results indicate that the amino-terminal 500 residues of MHCK A, which are predicted to form a coiled-coil structure, are responsible for MHCK A oligomerization.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1596-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), predicts whether a sequence is expected to form a two- or three-stranded coiled-coil. According to this algorithm, MHCK A is predicted to form a three-stranded coiled-coil (data not shown).Full-length MHCK A was visualized by platinum rotary shadowing (Fig.6). The majority of the rotary-shadowed images appeared globular or aggregated, as in the lower right panel of Fig.6. However, a number of images were also observed that appeared to reveal a globular domain associated with an extended rod-like structure (all other panels in Fig. 6). Measurements of these images indicated an average length for the rod-like segments of ∼50 nm. The average calculated pitch of coiled-coil helices from proteins such as myosin tails is 6.7 residues/nm. If MHCK A residues 100–500 were contained entirely in a coiled-coil structure (15Futey L.M. Medley Q.G. Côté G.P. Egelhoff T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 523-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), a rod domain of ∼60 nm would be predicted. This value is agreement with the ∼50-nm length of the rod structures observed by rotary shadowing. The apparent globular segment of the images was always observed at only one end of the rod segment, suggesting that MHCK A complexes form via parallel oligomerization rather antiparallel oligomerization.Figure 6Full-length MHCK A prepared by rotary shadowing. Purified MHCK A was sprayed in a solution containing 20–50 μg/ml protein in 50% glycerol and plated with platinum as described previously (31Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct.

Incorporation of the first 3 mol of phosphate was shown to be sufficient for maximum activation (18Medley Q.G. Gariepy J. Côté G.P.

Full-length MHCK A, ΔCoil-MHCK A, and ΔWD-MHCK A all autophosphorylated to a similar range of 8–10 mol of phosphate/mol of enzyme (Fig. 7 a).

The phosphorothioated hammerhead ribozymes targeted unique regions of the P. falciparum carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II gene. The P. falciparum carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II gene encodes the first and limiting enzyme in the pathway, and its mRNA transcript contains two large insert regions absent in other carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases, including that from humans. These inserts are ideal targets for nucleic acid therapy. Exogenous delivery of ribozymes to cultures reduced malarial viability up to 55% at 0.5 μm ribozyme concentrations, which is significantly greater than control levels (5–15% reduction), suggesting a sequence-specific inhibition. This inhibition was shown to be stage-specific, with optimal inhibitions being detected after 24 h, coincident with maximal production of the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase enzyme in the course of the life cycle of the parasite. A decrease in total carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity was observed only in cultures treated with the ribozymes. The task of developing alternative therapeutic agents against malaria is urgent due to the evolution of drug-resistant strains of P. falciparum, the most virulent of all human malarial parasites. Another critical issue to be addressed is the possibility of eliminating or reducing any systemic toxicity to the host, which can potentially be provided by nucleic acid therapy. This work is the first reported assessment of the ability of ribozymes as antimalarials. Ribozyme inhibition assays can also aid in identifying important antimalarial loci for chemotherapy.

The malarial parasite can, in turn, be a useful in vivohost to study the catalysis and function of new ribozyme designs. Malaria remains a major health problem not only in Africa and Asia, where it afflicts >200 million people annually, but also for migrants and travelers due to unreliable drug regimes (1Kozarsky P.E. Lobel H.O. Curr. Opin. Infect. Dis. 1994; 7: 701-707Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The important factors that preclude the eradication of malaria are the emergence of parasite and vector resistance to drugs and insecticides and the slow development of universal strategies for malaria vector control (2Collins F.H. Paskewitz S.M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 1995; 40: 195-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). New antimalarials with well defined modes of action are urgently needed for treatment of widespread drug-resistantPlasmodium falciparum strains, the most virulent of the four species of human malaria.The development of inhibitors of pyrimidine biosynthesis in malaria has long been in the forefront of chemotherapy due to the inability of the parasite to salvage pyrimidines (3Gero A.M. O'Sullivan W.J. Blood Cells ( N. Y. ). 1990; 16: 467-498PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the enzymes and genes of this pathway have been characterized in our laboratory with the objective of developing antimalarials via rational drug design (4Gero A.M. Brown G.V. O'Sullivan W.J. J. Parasitol. 1984; 70: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Flores M.V.C. O'Sullivan W.J. Stewart T.S. Mol. Biochem.

Stewart, manuscript in preparation. Specific antagonists to these key enzymes can be synthesized after elucidating their three-dimensional structures. In addition to rational approaches, the newly characterized proteins can be used as substrates in the screening of existing drug libraries.An alternative approach to conventional drug therapy that is emerging in medicine in general is the use of nucleic acids as the therapeutic agent (7Sullivan, S. M. (1994) J. Invest. Dermatol., 103,Suppl. 5, 85S–89S.Google Scholar, 8Kiehntopf M. Esquivel E.L. Brach M.A. Herrmann F. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A prerequisite for the application of this therapy to infectious diseases is the availability of unique gene targets within the parasite. We have identified in this study the P. falciparum carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase as one such target. The potential of applying nucleic acid therapy to P. falciparumexists owing to differences in the malarial and host genomes as well as several inherent features of the parasite biology (9Sartorius C. Franklin R.M. Parasitol. Today. 1991; 7: 90-93Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 10Miller N. Vile R.G. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For example, selective entry by deoxyoligonucleotides into malaria-infected erythrocytes and not into uninfected cells (11Rapaport E. Misiura K. Agrawal S. Zamencnik P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8577-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) ensures specificity for parasitized cells. In theory, the very (A + T)-rich genome (70% A + T coding regions) of P. falciparum compared with that of human provides a high frequency of sequences that are unique to P. falciparum and are therefore suitable targets for sequence-specific nucleic acids such as antisense oligonucleotides and ribozymes. Furthermore, the high amino acid conservation of functional domains between the malarial and mammalian carbamoyl-phosphate synthetases (12Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is not reflected in the nucleotide level as P. falciparum codon usage is biased toward bases A and T at the third position of the triplet whenever possible (13Saul A. Battistutta D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).An additional feature of several P. falciparum genes, including all the pyrimidine genes studied so far, is the presence of unique insert sequences that are transcribed and translated. For example, the pfCPSII 2The abbreviation used is: pfCPSII, P. falciparum carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II. 2The abbreviation used is: pfCPSII, P. falciparum carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase II. gene contains two large inserted regions (600 and 1800 base pairs) positioned between junctions of the defined carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase domains, the glutamine aminotransferase and synthetase domains (5Flores M.V.C. O'Sullivan W.J. Stewart T.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).Attempts at curbing growth of malarial parasites using antisense deoxyoligonucleotides (14Sartorius C. Franklin R.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 1613-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 15Dawson P.A. Cochran D.A.E. Emmerson B.T. Gordon R.B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 60: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) has recently achieved significant progress. Earlier views that phosphorothioated deoxyoligonucleotides generally decreased parasite viability in a nonsequence-specific manner (16Clark D.L. Chrisey L.A. Campbell J.R. Davidson E.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have been revised following recent reports of sequence-specific action at oligonucleotide concentrations below 0.5 μmdirected against a range of targets (17Barker R.H. Metelev V. Rapaport E. Zamencnik P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Stein C.A. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 147-149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Our investigations center on another class of inhibitory nucleic acids called ribozymes. With antisense oligonucleotides, hybridization to complementary mRNA potentially exerts inactivation associated with the action of RNase H and inhibition of translation. In contrast, ribozymes encode a sequence that can direct the cleavage of the complementary mRNA and are not necessarily consumed in the reaction, hence acting at a catalytic rate (19Haseloff J. Gerlach W.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar).Ribozymes can be delivered to cells either endogenously or exogenously. Intracellular production of ribozymes is achieved by transcription from a transient or an integrated gene, whereas synthetic ribozymes are administered like conventional drugs. The main advantage of using synthetic ribozymes is the possibility of developing more nuclease-resistant oligonucleotides. However, the uptake inefficiency of these large molecules (8Kiehntopf M. Esquivel E.L. Brach M.A. Herrmann F. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) must also be taken into account.This work tests the feasibility of exogenous delivery of synthetic ribozymes as antimalarials and the potential of the pfCPSII gene as a target for such therapy. Targeting the insert regions of the gene could provide confirmation that these unique regions are integral in the pfCPSII mRNA. We show that simple ribozymes can inhibit growth ofP. falciparum in a sequence-dependent manner. Furthermore, using an effective antisense deoxyoligonucleotide directed against the dihydrofolate reductase gene (DHFR105) (17Barker R.H. Metelev V. Rapaport E. Zamencnik P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we demonstrate that the carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase ribozymes can perform as well as and potentially better than DHFR105.RESULTSCPSRz1 and CPSRz4 are all-RNA trans-acting hammerhead ribozymes (19Haseloff J. Gerlach W.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar) with 14-base hybridizing arms. 10 bases at both the 5′- and 3′-ends are phosphorothioated in an attempt to render nuclease stability. They were designed to cleave mRNA within the unique insert regions in the pfCPSII gene (5Flores M.V.C. O'Sullivan W.J. Stewart T.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 68: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) absent in all carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase genes, including that from mammals (12Simmer J.P. Kelly R.E. Rinker Jr., A.G. Scully J.L. Evans D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10395-10402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). CPSRz1 targets nucleotides 894–921 (insert 1), and CPSRz4 targets nucleotides 3719–3748 (insert 2). A catalytically inactive control ribozyme (RzM) bears the exact sequence of CPSRz4 except for two mutations, G5U and A14G (underlined in TableI), in the catalytic domain (28Hertel K.J. Pardi A. Uhlenbeck O.C. Koizumi M. Ohtsuka E. Uesugi S. Cedergren R. Eckstein F. Gerlach W.L. Hodgson R. Symons R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3252Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). An antisense control was prepared that contains the complementary arms of CPSRz4 as a fully phosphorothioated RNA molecule (As4). The controls were designed to determine if inhibition by CPSRz4 was via substrate mRNA cleavage rather than antisense-dependent mechanisms. Two controls (RzN and RzX, ribozymes bearing nonhybridizing arms) were prepared to determine the level of sequence-independent inhibition of molecules containing phosphorothioates. These controls have randomized arm sequence, but maintain an active catalytic domain. A well characterized antisense deoxyoligonucleotide, DHFR105 (17Barker R.H. Metelev V. Rapaport E. Zamencnik P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), targeting the dihydrofolate reductase gene was used as a reference control for this study. Unlike the former oligonucleotides, DHFR105 is a fully phosphorothioated DNA molecule, a conventional design in antisense technology.Table ISequences of oligonucleotides usedCPSRz1ACU AGA GAU Acu ugc uga uga guc cgu gag gac gaa aca AUU AUU AAA Au-OHCPSRz4AAC AUC AUG Uuc uuc uga uga guc cgu gag gac gaa acc UUG AUA AGU Ua-OHRzMAAC AUC AUG Uuc uuc uua uga guc cgu gag gac gac acc UUG AUA AGU Ua-OHAs4AAC AUC AUG UUC UUG ACC UUG AUA AGU Ua-OHRzNCCG CCG UCG Gaa cuc uga uga guc cgu gag gac gaa aau UUG GCU CCG Aa-OHRzXUCU GCC UCA Gug cuc uga uga guc cgu gag gac gaa aca GCC CAU CUG Ga-OHDHFR105dTCT TAA AAA TAA TTT CTT CGT AGT TAa-OH3′-Bonds after upper-case letters are phosphorothioated.

Open table in a new tab In vitro cleavage analysis of CPSRz1 and CPSRz4 showed that both ribozymes cleaved the radiolabeled pfCPSII mRNA fragment. Analysis of the time course of in vitro cleavage of CPSRz4 (Fig. 2) shows that it has a cleavage rate (t½) of 8 min and is comparable with other studies of ribozymes with similar arm lengths (23Perriman R. Graf L. Gerlach W.L. Antisense Res. Dev. 1993; 3: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Under the same conditions, no in vitro cleavage of the pfCPSII transcript was observed with RzM, RzN, and RzX (data not shown).Figure 2Ribozyme in vitro cleavage assay.

Preliminary tests for inhibition of parasite growth in culture were performed using serum-free medium formulated in our laboratory (29Flores, M. V. C., Berger, S. M., and Stewart, T. S. (1997)Parasitol. Res., in press.Google Scholar). Clearance of parasite infection after a 24-h treatment of synchronized ring-stage parasites was observed at ribozyme concentrations above 2 μm, with CPSRz4 being marginally more effective than CPSRz1 (data not shown). When the medium was supplemented with 10% human serum (pooled from a minimum of 10 donors, not heat-inactivated), the ribozymes maintained their antimalarial action. Serum-supplemented medium was thus used for all assays.Similar to the findings of Barker et al. (17Barker R.H. Metelev V. Rapaport E. Zamencnik P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), a stimulation of [3H]hypoxanthine incorporation (cpm) was detected in the cultures upon incubation with the various oligonucleotides. In this study, no considerable decrease in cpm was observed at oligonucleotide concentrations below 1.0 μm. This meant that quantification of growth reduction by measuring [3H]hypoxanthine uptake was redundant. Therefore, assessments of further experiments were performed counting viable parasite cells by microscopic examination.Asynchronous cultures harvested after a 48-h incubation with ribozymes were significantly inhibited by DHFR105 (positive control) and CPSRz4 compared with the other control ribozymes (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3 A). Whereas RzM, RzN, and As4 produced very minimal reduction of parasite growth (10–15%) throughout the range of oligonucleotide concentrations, CPSRz4 showed increasing suppression starting from 100 nm concentrations, almost as effective as the dihydrofolate reductase antisense deoxyoligonucleotide (DHFR105). Inhibition by DHFR105 reached 60% and that by CPSRz4 reached 40% at 0.5 μm oligonucleotide concentrations.Figure 3Effect of varying concentrations of oligonucleotides on the growth of P. falciparum in culture. Oligonucleotides (0–0.5 μm) were administered in triplicate parasite cultures at t = 0 under the following assay conditions: asynchronized parasites, 0.5% starting parasitemia, and 48-h incubation (A); synchronized parasites, 0.5% starting parasitemia, and 48-h incubation (B); and synchronized parasites, 2.0% starting parasitemia, and 24-h incubation (C). Parasite cell count was determined after the incubation period, and percent growth was calculated from average parasitemia in untreated controls.

In this assay, the parasites proceed through their full life cycle, i.e. from ring forms to the next generation of daughter rings. The pattern of inhibition was less overall than asynchronous assays with the subset of oligonucleotides tested (Fig. 3 B). CPSRz4 gave a total inhibition of only 30%. Interestingly, DHFR105 inhibition also dropped to a similar level, a decrease in effectiveness of almost half compared with results from asynchronous cultures (Fig. 3 A). The percent reduction by CPSRz4 and DHFR105 was maintained at 6-fold greater levels compared with controls.We also examined the levels of growth suppression of synchronous cultures after a 24-h exposure to a subset of oligonucleotides at a range of concentrations below 0.5 μm. The parasites were grown from ring forms to mature trophozoites, when they occupy almost the whole of the erythrocytic cytoplasm. This was devised to monitor stage-specific inhibition by CPSRz4. Inhibition by CPSRz4 was observed at concentrations as low as 20 nm, which was not seen in controls including DHFR105. This effect peaked at 55% suppression at 0.5 μm, whereas DHFR105 reached 30% inhibition (Fig.3 C).An initial indication whether inhibition by ribozymes was reflected in decreased carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase production was sought. Crude protein extracts from parasites incubated with 0.5 μmoligonucleotides for 24 h were prepared to determine the levels of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity.3 P. falciparum lactate dehydrogenase activity (27Makler M.T. Hinrichs D.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1993; 48: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) was also determined for comparison. Whereas no significant drop in lactate dehydrogenase activity was observed in parasites treated with the different oligonucleotides compared with untreated cultures (data not shown), a notable reduction in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity was detected in parasites incubated with CPSRz4 (Fig. 4). A decrease of almost 50% of the induced levels of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity over basal levels was observed.Figure 4Decrease in carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase enzyme activity upon treatment of parasite cultures with CPSRz4.Total carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase activity (cpm) was determined from parasites after a 24-h incubation with or without 0.5 μm oligonucleotides.

Esquivel E.L. Brach M.A. Herrmann F. J. Mol. Med. 1995; 73: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) is advancing in parasitology. Recent success in delineating a sequence-specific response to antisense therapy in P. falciparum in a range of gene targets (17Barker R.H. Metelev V. Rapaport E. Zamencnik P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 514-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) shows the potential of this technology.This work investigated the susceptibility of P. falciparumto ribozyme action via the pfCPSII mRNA target. This is the first report of administering ribozymes to malarial parasites to elicit growth inhibition. The application of this technology to the malarial system favors the use of chemically synthesized ribozymes over endogenous delivery for several reasons. The mature erythrocytes are apparently impermeable to oligonucleotides (30Levis J.T. Butler W.O. Tseng B.Y. Ts'o P.O.P. Antisense Res. Dev. 1995; 5: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but uptake is markedly increased once the cells are infected with malaria (11Rapaport E. Misiura K. Agrawal S. Zamencnik P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8577-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Whereas oligonucleotides of up to 20 bases can enter cells by distinct receptor-mediated mechanisms, larger and more charged molecules, like ribozymes, seem unlikely to be internalized in the same way (31Loke S.L. Stein C.A. Zhang X.H. Mori K. Nakanishi M. Subasinghe C. Cohen J.S. Neckers L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3474-3478Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). However, recent reports suggest that uptake of nucleic acids may vary depending on cell type (32Temsamani J. Kubert M. Tang J.Y. Padmapriya A. Agrawal S. Antisense Res. Dev. 1994; 4: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Tao L.-F. Marx K.A. Wongwit W. Jiang Z. Agrawal S. Coleman R.M. Antisense Res.

Stable transfection of P. falciparum by plasmids was achievable by electroporation, but cannot be fully attributed to it (35Wu Y. Sifri C.D. Lei H. Su X. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the possibility of an easier access to the intraerythrocytic space surrounding the parasite via parasitiphorous ducts (36Pouvelle B. Spiegel R. Hsiao L. Howard R.J. Morris R.L. Thomas A.P. Taraschi T.F. Nature. 1991; 353: 73-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) may clarify this phenomenon. This could also be the pathway utilized by oligonucleotides. There are no existing viral gene transfer systems forP. falciparum to date, and the transfection methodology is not clinically applicable for these purposes.The significantly higher level of suppression of malarial growth exerted by CPSRz4 compared with the other control oligonucleotides indicates a gene sequence-specific mode of action at low concentrations. Control ribozymes that encode an active ribozyme domain but that bear arms with random nucleotide sequence (RzN and RzX) inhibited very minimally (<5%) even at a 0.5 μmlevel.The antisense RNA As4 and the catalytically inactive form of CPSRz4 (RzM) showed marginally better suppression over the negative controls. CPSRz4 performed consistently better than As4 and RzM in all assay procedures. It must be emphasized that As4 is used here as a tool to probe the catalytic activity of CPSRz4, hence its RNA phosphorothioate composition, mimicking the complementary arms of CPSRz4. A DNA phosphorothioate analogue, commonly used in therapeutic antisense design, would be expected to have greater inhibitory properties due to its greater stability and the complementary action of RNase H. Although both As4 and RzM hybridize to pfCPSII mRNA, only RNA-RNA interactions are formed. Inactivation is therefore limited to direct blockage of the translation machinery since RNase H-mediated inhibition requires RNA-DNA hybrids. The low levels of growth reduction afforded by As4 and RzM do not differ significantly, so it can be inferred that they inactivate via the same mechanism. Hence, the observed efficiency of CPSRz4 in reducing parasite growth by almost 8-fold (Fig.3 A) is due to inactivation by catalytic cleavage.When synchronous, instead of asynchronous, cultures were used in a 48-h assay (Fig. 3 B), similar levels of inhibition (30%) were observed for CPSRz4 and DHFR105. This meant that the percent reduction exerted by DHFR105 decreased by half. The effect of CPSRz4 also went from 40 to 30%. In an asynchronous situation, different life forms of the asexual parasite are present and are developing through the cycle in a 48-h period. Presuming that the gene targets are expressed stage-specifically, there will consequently be a constant level of target mRNA to be inactivated in the course of the experiment. Since DHFR105 is far more stable than CPSRz4 in a 48-h period (data not shown), one expects the antisense to perform better, as we have observed (Fig. 3 A). However, in a synchronous culture, when only one population of the parasite is subjected to inhibition, the levels of growth suppression for both oligonucleotides have consistently been similar (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that both antagonists perform equally well against their respective loci within a certain time frame in the 48-h life cycle of malaria. Theoretically, these time frames have to coincide with optimal levels of gene expression and enzyme production of the target genes. Previous studies have shown maximal production of the pyrimidine de novoenzymes at ∼24–27 h of the parasite's life cycle (4Gero A.M. Brown G.V. O'Sullivan W.J. J. Parasitol. 1984; 70: 536-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). There is also evidence that dihydrofolate reductase gene expression in P. falciparum peaks after 36 h (11Rapaport E. Misiura K. Agrawal S. Zamencnik P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8577-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Monitoring CPSRz4 inhibition of synchronized parasites for 24 h (i.e. from ring form to trophozoite stage) demonstrated a reduction in malarial viability at concentrations as low as 20 nm (Fig. 3 C). Maximal suppression at 0.5 μm was 3–5-fold greater than with the control constructs (RzM and As4). Using this assay, CPSRz4 performed 2-fold better than DHFR105. This clearly shows that the time of inhibition by CPSRz4 precedes that by DHFR105, and in an experimental window of 24 h, during the maturation of rings to trophozoites, CPSRz4 is a better inhibitor.The inhibitory effect of a single dose of CPSRz4 linearly increased over a 24-h time course (data not shown). This may reflect two things: first, an increased efficiency of the parasites to take up oligonucleotides as they develop; and second, an increased availability of target molecules in preparation for schizogony. One or both of these factors may be at play, but this will need further clarification. The current data indicate a time-dependent inhibition by CPSRz4 and DHFR105, the former taking effect at least 12 h earlier than the latter. If onset of parasite death is conditioned b"

We investigated the effect of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) on the activity of the X promoter. Cotransfection of the ATF2 expression vector with a X promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid repressed the X promoter activity in HepG2 cells. HBx activated activating protein 1 (AP-1)-mediated transcription through the hepatitis B virus E element by 35-fold, while its activation activity was inhibited in the presence of ATF2, suggesting that ATF2 inhibited the autoactivation of X promoter by HBx and basal transcription mediated by AP-1. Since the binding sites of AP-1 and ATF2 in the hepatitis B virus E element overlap, the repression of X promoter activity by ATF2 is exerted by the competition for the AP-1 binding site and the formation of the ATF2-Jun heterodimer as in the case of the consensus AP-1 element. However, the small X promoter had a ATF2 binding site and was activated by ATF2. These results suggest that the syntheses of X proteins are differentially regulated by ATF2.

HBV, unlike the other DNA viruses, encodes reverse transcriptase and replicates through reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA (3Shin H.J. Rho H.M. J. Biol.

Cell. 1982; 29: 403-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The production of pregenomic RNA is regulated by a combined interaction of HBV enhancers (5Park G.T. Choi C.Y. Rho H.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1996; 77: 2775-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 6Su H. Yee J.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2708-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One of the HBV genes, X, encodes a basic protein of 154 amino acids. It has been implicated in the carcinogenicity of this virus and is regarded as a major causative factor due to its ability to induce hepatocellular carcinoma in transgenic mice (7Kim C.-M. Koike K. Saito I. Miyamura T. Gilbert J. Nature. 1991; 351: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). The X protein exhibits a transcriptional activation function for many viral and cellular genes without binding to DNA (8Spandau D.F. Lee C.-H. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 427-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (reviewed in Ref. 9Rossner M.T. J. Med. Virol. 1992; 36: 101-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition, a 3′-truncated X gene-cell fusion product from integrated HBV DNA in chronic hepatitis tissue (10Takada S. Koike K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5628-5632Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and a 3′-elongated X product of 193 amino acid (21 kDa) from mutant HBV DNA (11Kim S.H. Hong S.P. Kim S.K. Lee W.S. Rho H.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 2421-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Kim S.K. Jang S.K. Rho H.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 917-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) were shown to exert a transactivation function. Smaller forms of the X protein, initiated at the second and the third ATG codons of the X ORF, are also important in the transacting function. All three forms of the X protein can individually transactivate a class III promoter, which transcribes the tRNA and 5 S rRNA by RNA polymerase III. In contrast, transactivation of several different class II promoters, which transcribe the mRNAs by RNA polymerase II, displays various requirements for the different X proteins (13Kwee L. Lucito R. Aufiero B. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The small X promoter expresses the smaller X gene transcripts that arise within the X ORF and whose heterogeneous 5′ ends straddle the second ATG codon. A positive regulatory element is also known to be necessary for the efficient transcription from the small X promoter (14Choi C.Y. Park G.T. Rho H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). One of the HBV enhancers, the EnI enhancer, partially overlaps with the X gene promoter and is located between the S gene and the X gene coding sequences (15Shaul Y. Rutter W.J. Laub O.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7457-7472Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This enhancer is composed of at least five different factor binding sites named 2C, GB, EP, E, and NF1 sites (17Ben-Levy R. Faktor O. Berger I. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1804-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Chen M. Hieng S. Qian X. Costa R. Ou J.-H. Virology. 1994; 205: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Dikstein R.

A liver-enriched transcription factor, HNF3, binds to the 2C site, and HNF4, RXRα and COUP-TF bind to the GB element in vitro (20Garcia A.D. Ostapchuk P. Hearing P. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3940-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear factor EF-C and NF1 bind to the inverted repeat of the EP element and NF1 site, respectively (22Ostapchuk P. Scheirle G. Hearing P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The E element is bound by ATF2/CREB and AP-1, and also mediates the transactivation of X promoter activity by X protein. Deletion, linker scanning, and point mutation analyses of the E element revealed that mutation of the E element reduced X promoter activity by 20–50% (23Gustin K. Shapiro M. Lee W. Burk R.D.

B, CAT assay using the heterologous reporter plasmids. The ATF2 expression plasmid was cotransfected with heterologous reporter plasmids, Etkcat and CREtkcat, which have five copies of E oligonucleotide and three copies of consensus CRE oligonucleotide, respectively, in front of tk promoter. Two micrograms and one microgram of Etkcat and CREtkcat, respectively, were cotransfected into HepG2 cells with 5 μg of ATF2 expression vector as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We investigated the functional interaction between binding proteins on the E element and the functional implication of X protein in the regulation of the X promoter. Cotransfection of an ATF2 expression vector with a X promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) construct repressed the X promoter activity. Etkcat, a heterologous plasmid containing the E element in front of the tk promoter, was used as a reporter for combinational cotransfection of ATF2, c-Jun, c-Fos, and HBx expression vectors, which revealed that ATF2, by interfering with AP-1, inhibits basal transcription of the X promoter and the transactivation activity of HBx through AP-1. In addition, we also tested whether the small X promoter activity is influenced by ATF2. Although the X promoter was repressed by ATF2, the small X promoter had a ATF2 binding site and was stimulated by ATF2. We conclude that syntheses of X proteins are differentially regulated by ATF2. The X promoter-CAT reporter plasmid (Xpcat) was constructed by insertion of the AccI (nt 1069)-BamHI (nt 1397) fragment of HBV-adr-k (25Rho H.M. Kim K.T. Hyun S.W. Kim Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) in front of the CAT gene. The mutant plasmid (XMpcat) has mutations in the ATF2 binding site of E element which were generated by oligonucleotide-directed in vitro mutagenesis (EM, 5′-CTGCCAAGTATTTGCTAATTCAACCCCCA-3′). The mutated sequences are underlined. The Etkcat was constructed by inserting pentamerized double stranded E (5′-CTGCCAAGTATTTGCTGACGCAACCCCCA-3′) oligonucleotide into theSmaI site of pBLcat2. APtkcat and CREtkcat were constructed by inserting trimerized double stranded consensus AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) and CRE (5′-AGAGATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGCTAG-3′) oligonucleotides, purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), into the SmaI site of pBLcat2, respectively. Eukaryotic expression plasmids of HBx, the small X promoter-CAT construct and serial deletion constructs were described previously (14Choi C.Y. Park G.T. Rho H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The ATF2 eukaryotic expression vector was constructed by subcloning the full-length ATF2 cDNA into the pECE expression vector (26Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The c-Jun and c-Fos expression vectors were kindly provided by K. Kim (Seoul National University, Korea). Bacterial expression vectors for ATF2 and c-Fos were constructed by inserting their cDNAs in frame into pGEX-3X. MBP-fused X, middle X, and small X expression vectors were obtained by inserting full-length and deleted fragments of X genes into the pMAL-c2 plasmid, resulting in proteins which have amino acid residues 1–154, 70–154, and 105–154 of X protein, respectively. For the construction of expression plasmid of truncated c-Jun (pETc-junΔ), the c-jun gene was subcloned into the vector pET3b (Stratagene) to generate the plasmid pETc-jun and subsequently deleted the DNA fragment between the two AvaI sites (nucleotides 220 and 679 of the c-jun gene), which resulted in the deletion of amino acids between 74 and 232 of c-Jun protein. Proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose filters for 1 h at 20 °C using 5 V/cm2. Blocking was carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 5% defatted dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20, followed by washing and incubation of the membranes with antibodies in the same buffer without defatted dry milk. Polyclonal X antibodies were diluted 1:2,000 and used as primary antibodies. After incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the blot was further incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with a horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit mouse antibody. Protein/antibody complexes were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient transfection and CAT assay were performed as described previously (14Choi C.Y. Park G.T. Rho H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Approximately 12 h prior to transfection HepG2 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106/60-mm diameter plate. Transfection of plasmid DNA into HepG2 cells was carried out by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (27Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). Typically, 2 μg each of reporter and effector plasmids were used. The total amount of transfected DNA was always adjusted to 12 μg with pUC19. After 42 h, cells were harvested, and CAT assays were performed. Cell extracts were normalized to the total amount of protein, as determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). CAT enzymatic activity was quantitated by measuring conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms using the BAS radio analytic imaging system according to manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Escherichia coli cells were grown in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Subsequently the cells were induced under vigorous shaking conditions with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. GST fusion proteins were purified according to the protocol from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., and MBP-fused X proteins were purified according to the Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (28Riggs, P. (1992) in Short Protocols in Molecular Biology (Ausubel, F. M. et al. eds.) Unit 16.6, Wiley, New York.Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions were carried out in a 15-μl volume, which typically contains 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), and 2 μg of bovine serum albumin. Prior to the reaction with DNA, 100 ng each of c-Jun, GST-Fos, GST-ATF2, and MBP-HBx proteins were mixed and incubated for 20 min. Antibodies against ATF2 and c-Jun were from Santa Cruz Biotech. Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). DNA binding was started by adding 10,000 cpm of probe to the preincubated reaction mixture with incubation for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide = 60:1) in 0.5 × TBE (44 mm Tris, 44 mm boric acid and 1 mmEDTA). After electrophoresis, gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The pETc-junΔ plasmid was linearized and used for the coupled in vitrotranscription and translation reaction. Truncated c-Jun protein was synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysates programmed with the in vitro transcribed mRNA in the presence of unlabeled methionine according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). DNase I footprinting analysis was performed as described previously (14Choi C.Y. Park G.T. Rho H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) with some modifications as follow. Briefly, the SacII site (nt 1445) was cut and then radiolabeled by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 7000 Ci/mmol) after dephosphorylation with calf intestinal phosphatase. The radiolabeled DNA fragment was cut with DraI (nt 1719), fractionated on an 6% polyacrylamide gel and isolated by electroelution for DNase I footprinting. To study the effect of ATF2 on the activity of the HBV X promoter, an expression plasmid encoding ATF2 cDNA was cotransfected into HepG2 cells together with a X promoter-CAT construct (Xpcat), or a construct having mutations in the ATF2 binding site of the E element (XMpcat). As shown in Fig. 1 A, ATF2 repressed CAT expression from the X promoter two fold in HepG2 cells, but not with a construct having a mutation in the ATF2 binding site. These data suggest that ATF2 repressed X promoter activity through the ATF2 binding site. Since ATF2 is known to be an activator, we investigated the effect of ATF2 on the consensus CRE cis-element in a heterologous promoter system. The oligonucleotides of E and consensus CRE were multimerized and inserted in front of the tk promoter. The resulting plasmids were cotransfected with the ATF2 expression vector. ATF2 activated CRE-mediated expression from the tk promoter 8-fold, whereas it repressed E element-mediated expression from the tk promoter (Fig. 1 B). It is well known that ATF2 activates CRE-mediated transcription (29Brindle P.K. Montminy M.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These results imply that other transcription factors may be the target for repression of the X promoter by ATF2. The sequence of the E element (5′-TGACGCAA-3′) is almost identical to consensus CRE and AP-1 binding sites. Also, the bindings of AP-1 and ATF2 on this element were reported previously (30Faktor O. Budlovsky S. Ben-Levy R. Shaul Y. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1861-1863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,31Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A. Science. 1991; 252: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To see the repression mechanism of ATF2, we cotransfected c-Jun, c-Fos, ATF2, and HBx expression vectors in various combinations into HepG2 cells with Etkcat as a reporter plasmid, and asked whether ATF2 can inhibit AP-1 activity and HBx-mediated transcriptional activation. The Jun homodimer and Jun/Fos heterodimer activated the reporter plasmid about 9- and 7-fold, respectively (Fig.2 A, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). The activation property was increased with coexpression of HBx 25- and 35-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 A, lanes 11 and 13, respectively). But the expression of Fos alone exhibited no significant activation with or without the expression of HBx protein (Fig. 2 A, lanes 12 and4). Cotransfection of ATF2 expression vector repressed the transactivation by Jun and Jun/Fos (Fig. 2 A, comparelanes 3 and 5 with lanes 7 and9, respectively). This repression of Jun and Jun/Fos by ATF2 was also shown in the additional activation by HBx (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 11 and 13 with lanes 14and 16, respectively). It is of interest that ATF2 repressed the activity of the Jun/Fos heterodimer (Fig. 2 A,lanes 9 and 16) more than that of the Jun homodimer (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7 and 14) especially with additional activation by HBx. To assess this observation, we explored the physical interaction among binding proteins on the E element with a mobility shift assay. The same amounts of GST-Fos, GST-ATF2, c-Jun, and MBP-HBx were used for the assays. Jun or Jun/Fos by themselves bound to the E element, although binding efficiency was 5- to 7-fold lower (Fig. 2 B,lanes 1 and 2) than that of the consensus AP-1 element (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and2). But the addition of ATF2 protein resulted in the diminished binding of Jun or Jun/Fos protein (Fig. 2 B,lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, Jun alone decreased the binding of ATF2 on the E element (Fig. 2 B, lane 4), whereas Jun/Fos did not (Fig. 2 B, lane 5). Addition of anti-Jun antibody to the mixtures of ATF2 and Jun, or ATF2 and Jun/Fos resulted in the unchanged binding of ATF2 and no supershifted complex (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and8). But the DNA-protein complexes were supershifted by anti-ATF2 antibody (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7 and9). These data demonstrate that the binding of ATF2 to the E element hindered the binding of AP-1 (Jun/Fos) probably due to the overlapping binding sites in the E element. For the demonstration of the ATF2's stronger affinity for the E element than that of AP-1, we examined the effect of increasing amounts of ATF2 on the binding of AP-1. When the amount of ATF2 increase from 20 ng to 100 ng to the fixed 100 ng of AP-1 protein, less than 50 ng of ATF2 could completely abolish the binding of AP-1 to the E element (Fig. 2 C). These results clearly showed that the ATF2 has a stronger affinity for the E element than that of AP-1. MBP-HBx augmented the binding of ATF2 on the E element, but could not induce the binding of Jun or Jun/Fos in the presence of ATF2 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 10 and11). To examine the change of AP-1-mediated transcription by ATF2, which does not bind well to the consensus AP-1 site, transient transfection and mobility shift assays were performed (Fig. 3). Jun and Jun/Fos bound to the AP-1 site efficiently (Fig. 3 A,lanes 1 and 2), which was also confirmed by a supershift by anti-Jun antibody (Fig. 3 A, lane 5), but incubation of ATF2 with Jun prior to the addition of the probe did not alter the mobility of the complex (Fig. 3 A,lanes 3 and 4) and no super-shifted band was detected with anti-ATF2 antibody (Fig. 3 A, lane 6). This result suggests that ATF2/Jun heterodimer as well as ATF2 homodimer did not bind well to the consensus AP-1 site. However, the addition of increasing amounts of ATF2 decreased the binding of Jun homodimer on the AP-1 site (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7–10). These results suggest that the formation of the ATF2/Jun heterodimer decreased the formation of the Jun homodimer and consequently diminished the binding of Jun homodimer on the AP-1 site. We next examined the effect of ATF2 on the transcription mediated by AP-1 binding sites (Fig. 3 B). The decreased expression from the tk promoter was observed by cotransfection of the ATF2 expression vector with the APtkcat reporter, even though ATF2 alone could not bind to the AP-1 site. Coexpression of Jun/Fos augmented the AP-1-mediated transcription from tk promoter four-fold (Fig. 3 B,lane 3). The activation by Jun/Fos was further enhanced by cotransfection with the HBx expression vector (Fig. 3 B,lane 4). However, coexpression of ATF2 diminished the activation by Jun/Fos and the additional activation by HBx (Fig.3 B, lanes 5 and 6). In summary, ATF2 could also repress AP-1 activity in a manner consistent with a protein-protein interaction. It was also tested if the binding activity of ATF2 and c-Jun on the HBV E element is affected by protein-protein interaction. To discriminate the DNA-protein complexes of c-Jun, ATF2, and ATF2/c-Jun heterodimer, the truncated c-Jun between amino acids 74 and 232 was obtained byin vitro translation and used for the analysis. The truncated c-Jun (c-JunΔ) contains the intact DNA-binding domain and leucine zipper domain which is responsible for dimerization with other proteins. The ATF2/c-JunΔ heterodimer, which migrates between c-JunΔ and ATF2, bound well on the CRE element (Fig. 3 C,lanes 3 and 4) but did not bind efficiently on the HBV E element (Fig. 3 C, lanes 8 and9). Therefore, ATF2 could repress transcription mediated by cis-elements such as consensus AP-1 site and HBV E element on which ATF2/c-Jun heterodimer do not bind efficiently. We investigated whether HBx affects the binding of Jun, Jun/Fos and ATF2 on the E element (Fig. 2 B, lanes 10 and 11). HBx enhanced the binding affinity of ATF2 to the E element 5–10-fold (Fig. 4 A,lanes 4 and 5). Smaller forms of X protein, which have the C-terminal domain in common, were reported to activate class II and III promoters (13Kwee L. Lucito R. Aufiero B. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Zheng Y.-W. Riegler J. Wu J. Yen T.S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22593-22598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Smaller forms of X protein were also examined for interaction with ATF2 (Fig. 4). Increasing amounts of full-length X (Fig. 4 A, lanes 4 and 5) and middle X proteins (Fig. 4 A, lanes 6 and7) increased the binding of ATF2 on the E element. However, small X protein (Fig. 4 A, lanes 8 and9) increased the ATF2-binding only slightly. To see whether ATF2 and X proteins can interact with each other in the absence of a cis-element, X proteins were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads containing immobilized GST-ATF2, and then washed extensively with PBS three times. The interacted proteins were eluted with PBS containing 0.1% triton X-100, and electrophoresed in a 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Bands corresponding to the full-length X and middle X proteins were detected with anti-HBx antibody (Fig. 4 B, lanes 2 and 3). However, only a faint band of small X protein was detected by the Western analysis (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). These observations agree with that of the mobility shift assay (Fig. 4 A). Middle X and small X proteins have amino acid residues 70–105 and 105–154 of full length X protein, respectively. Therefore, amino acid residues 70–105 of X protein participates in the interaction with ATF2. This domain of X protein corresponds to one of three domains that are known to interact with cellular proteins (33Takada S. Koike K. Virology. 1994; 205: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These data also indicate that X protein can interact with ATF2 in the absence of a proper cis-element. We next investigated the effect of ATF2 on the activity of the small X promoter. A series of small X promoter deletion constructs, described previously (14Choi C.Y. Park G.T. Rho H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), was cotransfected into HepG2 cells with the ATF2 expression vector. As shown in Fig. 5 A, expression from pHH115, which has only a minimal promoter region, was still activated by ATF2 (Fig. 5 A, lane 10), suggesting that the region between nt 1567 and 1679 is responsible for the activation by ATF2. This region corresponds to the minimal small X promoter and was already known to have several transcription factor binding sites, including HNF4 and Sp1 (34Zhang P. Raney A.K. McLachlan A. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1472-1481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Yuh C.-H. Ting L.-P. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 4281-4287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this region has the binding site for ATF2, a 115 base pair HpaII-HincII DNA fragment was radiolabeled and used as a probe for a mobility shift assay (Fig. 5 B). Incubation of purified GST-ATF2 with DNA probe resulted in a specific DNA-ATF2 complex which competed with a 50-fold molar excess of E element, but not with the same amount of mutant oligonucleotide, EM, indicating that ATF2 binds specifically to the minimal small X promoter. To know the exact binding site of ATF2 on the small X promoter, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed withSacII-DraI DNA fragment (nt 1145–1719) as a probe. The protected region by ATF2 spanned from nt 1638 to 1656, and have a sequence (TTACATAA) similar to the ATF2 binding site of E-selectin promoter (TGACATCA) (36Kaszubaska W. Van Huijsduijnen R. Ghersa P. DeRaemy-Schenk A.-M. Chen B. hai T. DeLamarter J. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7180-7190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that this protected region of the small X promoter is responsible for the activation by ATF2. Two enhancers, EnI and EnII, have been identified in the HBV genome (15Shaul Y. Rutter W.J. Laub O. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 427-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Tognoni A. Cattaneo R. Serfling E. Schaffner W.

EnI is located in the region downstream of the HBsAg ORF and upstream of the X ORF. Therefore, the transcription from the X promoter was largely dependent on the EnI activity. EnI is composed of multiple functional elements that act synergistically to stimulate transcription. Two regions of E and EF-C in particular appear to be important for EnI to exhibit a transacting function (17Ben-Levy R. Faktor O. Berger I. Shaul Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1804-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 22Ostapchuk P. Scheirle G. Hearing P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2787-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Shaul Y. Ben-Levy R. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1913-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In this report, we analyzed the transcriptional regulation of X promoter mediated by the E element of EnI. ATF2, one of the binding proteins of the E element, repressed AP-1 and HBx-mediated transcriptional activation of the X promoter. It was especially of interest that EnI activity was negatively regulated by the transcription factor ATF2, which is known to be a general activator. Since AP-1 and ATF2 could bind to the same site of the E element independently and were known to interact with each other, it is likely that the down-regulation of the X promoter by ATF2 occurs via the direct competition for factor binding sites and the formation of the ATF2/c-Jun heterodimer which can not bind efficiently to the E element. Though some genes have an autonomous silencer element (40Brand A.H. Breeden L. Abraham J. Sternglanz R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1985; 41: 41-48Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), others may be repressed by the displacement of transactivator proteins from the promoter element. In the case of the sea urchin histone H2B-1 gene, a displacement protein appears to sterically prevent interaction of the CAAT-binding protein (41Barberis A. Superti-Furga G. Busslinger M. Cell. 1987; 50: 347-359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Direct protein-protein interaction between members of different transcription factor families may be a general mechanism by which a limited number of transcription factors can specifically regulate a large number of genes. Gene repression by protein-protein interaction was also observed in the HBV genes. Addition of Jun, but not of Jun/Fos, in the incubation mixture reduced the binding of ATF2 on the E element, indicating that the reduction of ATF2 binding was caused not by the competition for binding sites but by protein-protein interaction. A variant of the AP-1 binding site and of CRE within the EnI of HBV could bind ATF2 and AP-1, respectively, but the Jun/ATF2 heterodimer did not bind well (Fig. 3 C,lanes 8 and 9). The AP-1 binding sites within the c-Jun (TTACCTCA) and ELAM promoters (TGACATCA) appear to specifically bind a Jun/ATF2 heterodimer, whereas only AP-1 binds on the consensus AP-1 binding site (TGAGTCA). Therefore, it appears that variants of both the CRE and AP-1 consensus binding sites determine the binding specificity of these sites for members of both the ATF/CREB and Jun/Fos families. The X gene product may stimulate its own synthesis through the E element (42Colgrove R. Simon G. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4019-4026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If so, this would obviously require a mechanism to down-regulate X expression after a desired level of X protein has been reached. In agreement with such an autoregulatory scheme, a reduction of HBV gene expression was observed if a high level of X gene product was supplied in trans (43Schek N. Fischer M. Schaller H. McLachlan A. Molecular Biology of the Hepatitis B Virus. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 181-192Google Scholar). A broad spectrum of X gene activity on transcription suggests the possibility that its expression during viral replication may have an influence on cellular genes that are involved in the regulation of HBV transcription. We postulate that ATF2 is one of the best candidates for the regulatory factor involved in the auto-regulation of HBx production. Overexpression and activation of ATF2 resulted in the enhanced binding of ATF2 and consequent repression of the X promoter. ATF2 can be activated both by regulatory proteins and through phosphorylation. Protein activators of ATF2 include adenovirus E1a, HTLV-I Tax, and HMGI(Y) (44Du W.D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 45Franklin A.A. Kubik M.F. Uittenbogaard M.N. Brauweiler A. Utaisincharoen P. Matthews M.-A.H. Dynan W.S.

The second ATF2 activation mechanism involves phosphorylation (48Livingstone C. Patel G. Jones N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1785-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 49van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of ATF2 would lead to a conformational change in ATF2, resulting in an increase of its DNA binding affinity. This possibility is consistent with the observation that ATF2 binding to DNA can be correlated with its phosphorylation state (50Abdel-Hafiz H.A.-M. Heasley L.E. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Kroll D.J. Johnson G.L. Hoeffler J.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this context, it could be postulated that HBx protein activates ATF2 both through direct interaction with ATF2 and the phosphorylation of ATF2 by activating some kinases. These observations suggest that activation of ATF2 by any pathway results in the repression of X promoter, and the production of X protein can be regulated automatically by ATF2. Kwee et al. (13Kwee L. Lucito R. Aufiero B. Schneider R.J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that smaller forms of X protein, initiated at the second and the third ATG codons of the X ORF, also have the transactivating function. Small X promoter and its positive regulatory element was reported to be located in the 5′-distal half of the X ORF (14Choi C.Y. Park G.T. Rho H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). ATF2 activated the small X promoter through the region responsible for the minimal small X promoter activity, while repressing the X promoter through the E element of EnI, suggesting that differential regulation of X proteins was exerted by ATF2. In our previous report (14Choi C.Y. Park G.T. Rho H.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we suggested that the X promoter may be regulated by downstream DNA sequences corresponding to the small X promoter. Although all three forms of the X protein can individually transactivate the class III promoter, transactivation of several different class II promoters displays various requirements for the different X proteins. Therefore, it is conceivable that the X protein and smaller forms of X protein may have different regulatory activities. In summary, differential regulation of X proteins by ATF2 would result in the expression of different forms of X protein and a different set of class II promoter would be modulated by X proteins."

The transport proteins and enzymes required for nucleoside utilization in Escherichia coli are encoded by genes belonging to the CytR regulon (1Hammer-Jespersen K. Munch-Petersen A. Metabolism of Nucleotides, Nucleosides and Nucleobases in Microorganisms. Academic Press, London1983: 203-258Google Scholar). This gene family consists of nine unlinked transcriptional units whose expression is coordinately controlled by the interplay of two gene regulatory proteins. Transcription is activated in response to intracellular cAMP levels by CRP 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, E. coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP is also referred to as CAP, catabolite activator protein); CID, cytidine induction defective; MWC, Monod Wyman and Changeux; KNF, Koshland Nemethy and Filmer; CDA, cytidine deaminase; UDP, uridine dephosphorylase; Cmr, chloramphenicol resistant; Amps, ampicillin-sensitive; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. 1The abbreviations used are: CRP, E. coli cAMP receptor protein (CRP is also referred to as CAP, catabolite activator protein); CID, cytidine induction defective; MWC, Monod Wyman and Changeux; KNF, Koshland Nemethy and Filmer; CDA, cytidine deaminase; UDP, uridine dephosphorylase; Cmr, chloramphenicol resistant; Amps, ampicillin-sensitive; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. and repressed by a three-protein, CRP· CytR·CRP, complex. Transcription is induced when CytR binds cytidine. A central feature of this coordinate regulation is that CytR and CRP bind cooperatively to their respective operators (2Pedersen H. Sogaard-Andersen L. Holst B. Valentin-Hansen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17804-17808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is so despite the role of CytR as a functional antagonist of CRP. The critical role that cooperativity plays is highlighted by the fact that expression is induced, because this cooperative interaction is lost when CytR binds cytidine. Cytidine binding has no effect on intrinsic CytR binding to DNA. CytR is a member of the LacI family of bacterial repressors (3Weickert M.J. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15869-15874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gene regulatory activity of each of these proteins is modulated by binding a peripheral ligand, which functions as either inducer or co-repressor. The basic DNA binding unit of each of these proteins is a homodimer in which helix-turn-helix domains from both subunits combine to form the DNA binding interface. Since both subunits harbor identical ligand binding sites, the allosteric mechanism that couples inducer or co-repressor binding to changes in the macromolecular interactions that regulate transcription is an important issue to this entire family of proteins. For both PurR and LacI, conformational transitions that accompany ligand binding have been investigated by x-ray crystallography (4Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G.

Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). In these two cases, binding of co-repressor or inducer, respectively, causes a change in tertiary structure that alters substantially the dimer interface. In the non-DNA binding conformation, hinge helices that connect the helix-turn-helix motif to the ligand binding globular core domain are destabilized, and the helix-turn-helix motifs from the two subunits are thought to be out of register with successive DNA major grooves. In this manner, cooperative ligand binding (7Daly T.J. Matthews K.S. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5479-5484Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 8Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6207-6214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to the individual subunits controls a concerted quarternary conformational change of the dimer. These features are consistent with MWC allostery. While the structural mechanisms that couple ligand binding to tertiary conformation differ in the two proteins (4Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Lu F. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Cell. 1995; 83: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G.

Science. 1996; 271: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), the tertiary and quarternary structural perturbations are remarkably similar. The structures of the LacI family proteins, including CytR, appear to be highly conserved (5Schumacher M.A. Choi K.Y. Zalkin H. Brennan R.G. Science. 1994; 266: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 6Lewis M. Chang G. Horton N.C. Kercher M.A. Pace H.C. Schumacher M.A. Brennan R.G. Lu P.

Chem. 1993; 268: 12282-12288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the structural resemblance among family members plus the similarity of allosteric mechanism for LacI and PurR, a similar mechanism might be anticipated for CytR. Yet CytR differs from all LacI family members in that it is cooperativity that is allosterically controlled and not intrinsic DNA binding. Allostery thus appears to have a different structural basis in CytR than in other LacI/PurR proteins. Understanding the allosteric mechanism is central to understanding coordinate regulation of the CytR regulon genes. Recently, we showed that CytR binds to multiple operators at one CytR regulated promoter,deoP2 (12Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33242-33255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CytR binding to the operator responsible for repression interacts cooperatively with CRP binding to flanking CRP sites, CRP1 and CRP2. However, by binding to additional specific sites, CytR competes with CRP for binding to CRP1 and CRP2. The net result of cooperativity and competition is that while CRP recruits CytR to form the repression complex, there is no significant reciprocal recruitment of CRP by CytR. This effect has also been reported for thenupG promoter (13Pedersen H. Dall J. Dandanell G. Valentin-Hansen P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 843-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These interactions presumably function to direct both a multistage activation of transcription, using both Class I and Class II CRP mechanisms (14Ebright R.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and also a similar multistage repression mediated by CytR. We have proposed that this might be a general feature of CytR-mediated gene regulation (12Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33242-33255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The unique mechanism of cytidine mediated induction also suggests a multistage process. The cooperativity to which cytidine binding is linked appears to be complementary pair wise in nature. This follows from the observation that the free energy change characterizing cooperativity in the three protein complex, CRP·CytR·CRP bound to DNA, is equal to the sum of free energy changes characterizing pair wise cooperativity between CytR and CRP bound either to CRP1 or to CRP2 (12Perini L.T. Doherty E.A. Werner E. Senear D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33242-33255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). If cooperativity in the three-protein repression complex is pairwise, then it is easy to envision that the two subunits of the dimer might react independently to cytidine binding. This would result in sequential elimination of pairwise, CytR·CRP cooperativity, hence sequential relief from repression, in response to sequential cytidine binding to the subunits. The most general possibilities for coupling between ligand binding and transcription initiation are presented in Fig. 1. We have combined biophysical chemical and molecular genetic approaches to investigate these possibilities. First, CytR binding to CRP-saturateddeoP2 was analyzed to evaluate the total contribution from cooperativity. Subsequently, CytR binding titrations were conducted as a function of cytidine concentration. The shape of the transition characterizing loss of cooperativity as cytidine binds CytR indicates that induction is an all or nothing process that occurs concomitant with only one of the cytidine binding steps. Second, CytR mutants were isolated and characterized as fully functional repressors, but which do not induce. The only defect in these mutants is inability to bind cytidine. By co-expressing cytidine induction-defective subunits and wild-type subunits, we evaluated whether the resulting heterodimers would support induction with only one subunit capable of binding cytidine. The combined data from these studies indicate that induction results when cytidine binds to the first subunit of the CytR dimer.Figure 1Schematic of CytR cooperativity states reflecting different allosteric models. CRP and CytR are shown bound to their respective operators, CRP1, CRP2, and CytO.Shading and object shape are used to distinguish differences in tertiary and quarternary states, respectively. Cooperativity is indicated by contact between adjacent proteins. Only the favored state is shown in each case, and symmetrically redundant configurations are not shown. A represents a concerted model featuring an equilibrium between pre-existing states. Cytidine binding shifts the poise of the equilibrium from favoring the cooperative state to favoring the noncooperative state. This is MWC allostery.B represents a sequential allosteric model in which cytidine binding induces a conformational change of only the subunit to which it binds. This eliminates cooperative interaction between that subunit and the adjacent DNA-bound CRP·cAMP and also affects interactions with the remaining subunit to affect its affinity for cytidine binding. This is KNF allostery. C represents sequential but concerted transitions between cooperativity states. Unliganded CytR interacts cooperatively with CRP·cAMP complexes bound to both flanking sites, CRP1 and CRP2. Binding of cytidine to the first subunit induces a state in which neither subunit interacts with adjacent bound CRP·cAMP. A similar model in which the obligatory transition to noncooperative binding occurs only when the second cytidine binds is also possible.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TableI lists the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study.

The control plasmid for these experiments is pCB135, a pSS584 derivative devoid of cytR coding sequence. Bacteria were collected from exponentially growing cultures for enzyme assays. The medium contained Vogel and Bonner salts (19Vogel H.J. Bonner D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 218: 97-106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with vitamin B1 at 5 μg/ml, 0.02% casamino acids, and 0.4% glycerol (20Barbier C.S. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BL21(DE3) derivatives harboring CytR plasmids were grown in a 1% Bacto-tryptone, 0.4% glycerol medium containing Vogel and Bonner salts (TV medium). Either L-broth or 2 × YT was used for transformations and plasmid preparations (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The Lac ± phenotypes of the various strains were determined on solid TTC-Lac medium as described previously (20Barbier C.S. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When used, the final cytidine concentration was 2 mm. Antibiotic concentrations used in the media were: ampicillin, 100 μg/ml; tetracycline, 15 μg/ml; chloramphenicol, 20 μg/ml; and kanamycin, 25 μg/ml in minimal medium or 50 μg/ml in rich medium. A mixture of mutagenic oligonucleotides complementary tocytR codons 276 through 284 was synthesized using an Applied Biosystems model 381A DNA synthesizer. The spiking protocol of Hutchison et al. (22Hutchison III, C.A. Nordeen S.K. Vogt K. Edgell M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Hutchison III, C.A. Swanstrom R. Loeb D.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 356-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was used to create degeneracy in the oligonucleotide sequence. The mutagenic oligonucleotide mixture and a site-directed mutagenesis kit from Amersham Corp. was used to mutate the cytR gene on an M13mp19cytR10 template. Both single and multiple mutations were obtained, the frequency of single mutations being about 30%. Phage pooled from about 5000 mutagenized M13mp19cytR10 plaques was propagated in E. coli strain JM103 by incubation for 4 h in 2 × YT medium. RF-M13 DNA was prepared as described (24Maniatas T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 4.29-4.32Google Scholar). The cytR gene fragment containing the mutagenized sequence bounded by ApaI andBamHI cleavage sites was subcloned into pCB093 by fragment exchange (20Barbier C.S. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid pool was transferred into SS6018 (cytR), which was grown on TTC-Lac-Kan medium containing 2 mm cytidine, to identify mutant CID repressors. The dominant negative phenotype of CytR mutants was established using CytR+ strain, SS6004, as described previously (20Barbier C.S. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state level of wild-type and mutant CytR was measured using a Western immunoblot analysis (20Barbier C.S. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each cytR mutation that yielded a stable mutant protein was identified by DNA sequencing of the mutagenized cytR gene segment on a purified, double-stranded template (20Barbier C.S. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteria used for enzyme assays were grown and cell extracts prepared as described previously (25Singer J.T. Barbier C.S. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cytidine deaminase (CDA) and uridine dephosphorylase (UDP) spectroscopic assays were performed as described previously (25Singer J.T. Barbier C.S. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 1095-1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Short S.A. Singer J.T. Gene ( Amst .). 1984; 31: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) except that the CDA assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.5 mm cytidine. The β-galactosidase activity of exponentially growing bacteria was measured as described by Miller (21Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). To express the enzyme activity as specific activity of the cell extracts, the total protein concentration of the extracts was measured by the Bradford assay (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. BL21(DE3) derivatives harboring T7 expression plasmids for either wild-type or mutant CytR were grown at 37 °C in nucleoside-free TV medium with 0.4% glycerol toA 600 ≈ 1.0. CytR expression was induced by adding 1% lactose and 2 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubating for 60 min before harvesting the cells. Cell pellets were washed, resuspended in 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Na4EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, and treated with lysozyme, added to 10 μg/ml. The cells were frozen at −20 °C, thawed at 23 °C, and broken by sonication. The final cell extract was the clear supernatant remaining following centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. CytR was purified using a simpler protocol than that reported several years ago (2Pedersen H. Sogaard-Andersen L. Holst B. Valentin-Hansen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17804-17808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but which yielded a higher yield of CytR with similar purity. All purification steps were carried out at 4 °C. Pellets from cells harvested 165 min postinduction were resuspended in 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.80), 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm Na4EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (R-buffer) supplemented with 0.3m NaCl. The resuspended cells were lysed using two passes through a French press and centrifuged at 50,000 × gfor 3 h. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl and 10% glycerol in R-buffer. Polyethyleneimine was added to a final concentration of 0.04% to precipitate nucleic acids and some proteins. The supernatant from a low speed centrifugation was adjusted to 0.1m NaCl and chromatographed on two Bio-Rad EconoPac Q cartridges (5 ml each) connected in series using a Pharmacia FPLC. The pooled CytR containing the flow-through peak was loaded on two Bio-Rad Econo-Pac S cartridges connected in series. After washing the column with 0.2 m NaCl R-buffer until theA 280 of the wash returned to the buffer base line, the column was eluted using a 0.2–0.6 m NaCl gradient. CytR elutes in a broad peak between 0.3 and 0.4 mNaCl. CytR concentration was estimated from an extinction coefficient of 0.30 ± 0.03 cm−1 mg−1 ml at 280 nm. This value was calculated from the average extinction coefficients for amino acid residues in a protein (28Waxman E. Rusinova E. Hasselbacher C.A. Schwartz G.P. Laws W.R. Ross J.B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Wetlaufer D.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1962; 17: 303-390Crossref Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 30Perkins S.J. Sim R.B. Eur. J.

The unusually low extinction is due to the fact that CytR contains no tryptophan. Based on the calculated extinction, the yield of CytR using this expression and purification protocol is 1.5–2 mg/g of cell paste. CytR is stored at a concentration of 2–3 mg/ml in the S-column elution buffer in a liquid nitrogen dewer after flash freezing as ∼25-μl beads in liquid nitrogen. The DNA and cytidine binding activities remain stable for at least several years when stored in this manner. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis shows this material to be homogeneous dimer, with no evidence for either dissociation to monomer or association to higher order polymers over the concentration range, 0.1–10 μm. 2J. Wool, D. F. Senear, and T. M. Laue, unpublished observations. More recent analysis of gel mobility shift assays of CytR binding to DNA has been interpreted to indicate that CytR remains as stable dimer over the range of concentrations at which it binds DNA operators (11Kristensen H.H. Valentin-Hansen P. Sogaard-Andersen L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260(2): 113-119Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Based on these data, the binding experiments were analyzed according to the simplest model in which CytR exists only as dimer. Binding of [3H]cytidine to purified wild-type CytR and to both wild-type and mutant CytR containing cell-free extracts was measured using a filter binding assay. Binding reaction mixtures contained either 18–50 nm purified CytR dimer or 15–30 μg of cell extract protein in a 100-μl volume containing 0.04–11.0 μm [3H]cytidine (NEN Life Science Products). Two different buffers were used: 1) 20 mm MOPS (pH 6.8), 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm NaEDTA, 200 mm NaCl and 2) 10 mm bis-Tris (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm CaCl2. Both buffers contained 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 μg/ml calf thymus DNA. Following a 5-min incubation at 23 °C, the CytR-bound [3H]cytidine contained in 80 μl of assay mix was collected on a prewashed nitrocellulose filter (Millipore HAWP 02500; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filters were washed once with 500 μl of assay buffer, air-dried, and then dissolved in 3.5 ml of Packard Filter-Count LSC mixture (Packard Instrument Co.). Radioactivity was measured using a Packard model 1900TR scintillation counter. For determination of nucleoside binding constants, binding assays were conducted as titrations by varying the nucleoside concentration at constant CytR concentration. The data were analyzed according to a simple Langmuir binding model as described below (see Equation 1) using a nonlinear least squares curve fitting program (32Leatherbarrow, R. J. (1990) GraFit Version 2.0, Erithacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK.Google Scholar). The CytR concentration used in some titrations was not negligible. To analyze data under these conditions, the conservation polynomials for total cytidine and total CytR were solved for the concentration of free cytidine for each data point and at each iteration of the nonlinear least squares analysis. The program NONLN (33Johnson M.L. Frasier S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 301-342Crossref Scopus (510) Google Scholar) was used for this purpose. In experiments to compare [3H]cytidine binding by CytR mutants in cell-free extracts and wild-type CytR, the CytR content of the cell-free extracts was estimated using Western immunoblots as described above. For each extract, 25–200 ng of extract protein was electrophoresed on SDS-16.5% acrylamide gels. Proteins were electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) as described previously (20Barbier C.S. Short S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2881-2890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CytR was complexed with anti-CytR antibody and 125I-protein A. 125I-Protein A in the complex was quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorIm"
https://openalex.org/W1968049528,"Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPr) has been shown to release intracellular Ca2+ from sea urchin eggs and a variety of vertebrate cell types, although its mechanism of action remains elusive. We employed the caged version of cADPr to study the [Ca2+] transient kinetics in intact sea urchin eggs for insights into how cADPr gates Ca2+ release. Ca2+ release triggered by photolytic production of cADPr was initially slow, with an effective delay of several hundred milliseconds before the onset of a rapid Ca2+ release phase. In contrast, Ca2+ release induced by photolysis of caged inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was immediate in onset and roughly an order of magnitude faster. The delay before cADPr-induced Ca2+ release was eliminated when the [Ca2+] was step-elevated coincident with the photoliberation of cADPr and greatly prolonged in the presence of exogenous Ca2+buffers. Thus, the slow onset of Ca2+ release does not reflect an intrinsically slow rate by which cADPr gates release channels. Rather, a [Ca2+] rise from resting levels is needed to achieve more than minimal cADPr activity. Full release of Ca2+ by cADPr in intact sea urchin eggs requires a positive Ca2+ feedback.

Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPr) 1The abbreviations used are: cADPr, cyclic ADP-ribose; RyRC, ryanodine receptor/channel; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; FI, fluorescence intensity; CG-5N, Calcium Green 5N; NP-EGTA, nitrophenyl-EGTA. has been found to be a potent mobilizer of intracellular Ca2+ in sea urchin eggs and in numerous vertebrate cell types (for review see Ref.1Lee H.C. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 355-388PubMed Google Scholar). Over the last few years, the accumulating evidence has strengthened the proposal that cADPr is a true calcium-mobilizing second messenger. For example, both cADPr and its metabolic enzymes have been found to be widely distributed in mammalian tissue (2Lee H.C. Graeff R. Walseth T.F. Biochimie. 1995; 77: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 3Rusinko N. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11725-11731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Walseth T.F. Aarhus R.

Further, cADPr production and Ca2+ release are linked to activation of the cGMP signal transduction pathway in sea urchin eggs and in cultured neurosecretory cells (5Galione A. White A. Willmott N. Turner M. Potter B.V. Watson S.P. Nature. 1993; 365: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 6Clementi E. Riccio M. Sciorati C. Nistico G. Meldolesi J. J. Biol.

The mechanism by which cADPr gates Ca2+ release remains unclear. cADPr-mediated Ca2+ release has been found to be enhanced by Ca2+ and sensitive to classical pharmacologic agonists and antagonists of ryanodine receptor/channels (RyRCs) (8Galione A.

(6Clementi E. Riccio M. Sciorati C. Nistico G. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17739-17745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) noted that cADPr-mediated Ca2+ release was only observed in a subclone of cultured PC12 cells that expressed type II RyRCs but was absence from a subclone not expressing RyRCs. These observations support the hypothesis that RyRCs are the ultimate target of this second messenger. Despite this rather strong circumstantial evidence, studies of the ability of cADPr to directly modulate skeletal and cardiac isoforms of the RyRC reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers have so far yielded equivocal results (12Meszaros L.G. Bak J. Chu A. Nature. 1993; 364: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 13Fruen B.R. Mickelson J.R. Shomer N.H. Velez P. Louis C.F.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 270-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, photoaffinity labeling studies with cADPr analogs (17Walseth T.F. Aarhus R. Kerr J.A. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26686-26691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have identified two specific binding proteins having molecular weights significantly smaller than that of known RyRCs. Moreover, at least in sea urchin eggs, cADPr-mediated Ca2+ release is obligately dependent on the presence of calmodulin (18Tanaka Y. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3244-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Gurnack M.E. Walseth T.F. Nature. 1994; 370: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the activation of Ca2+ release channels by cADPr may involve one or more mediator proteins and may entail multiple activation steps. We have previously noted (21Guo X. Laflamme M Becker P.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that Ca2+ release induced by flash photolysis of caged cADPr in intact sea urchin eggs occurred with a relatively slow onset (or delay), implying one or more slow steps in the activation pathway. To investigate the underlying basis for this slow onset in cADPr-induced Ca2+ release, we have examined the kinetic characteristics of the [Ca2+] transients induced by photolysis of caged cADPr under conditions where we could simultaneously manipulate the cytosolic [Ca2+]. We found that the delay before cADPr-induced Ca2+ release was eliminated when the [Ca2+] was step-elevated coincident with the photoliberation of cADPr and greatly prolonged in the presence of exogenous Ca2+ buffers. Thus, the slow onset of Ca2+ release was not due to an intrinsically slow rate by which cADPr (or Ca2+) gated release channels. Rather, our results show that cADPr is relatively ineffective at releasing Ca2+ at normal resting [Ca2+] levels and that a positive Ca2+ feedback is required to achieve full Ca2+ release. Further, these findings underscore the importance of controlling the [Ca2+] in investigations of cADPr-mediated Ca2+ release. Eggs were released from femaleLytechinus pictus sea urchins by intracoelomic injection of 0.5 m KCl and washed twice in artificial sea water containing (in mm): 460 NaCl, 27 MgCl2, 28 MgSO4, 10 CaCl2, 10 KCl, 2.5 NaHCO3; pH adjusted to 8.0 with NaOH. The jelly was removed by multiple filtrations through a 100-μm pore nylon filter. The eggs were transferred onto a poly-l-lysine-treated quartz coverslip that formed the bottom of a cell chamber filled with artificial sea water for microinjection and study. The microinjection solution contained a Ca2+ indicator dye (either 250 μm fluo-3 or 1–4 mm spectrally similar Calcium Green 5N (CG-5N)) and various concentrations of either caged cADPr, caged IP3, caged calcium, and/or heparin dissolved in a microinjection buffer (0.5 m KCl, 50 μmEGTA, 10 mm MOPS, pH 6.7, with KOH). The injected volume was estimated from the Ca2+ dye fluorescence calibrated against fluorescence measurements made of droplets of dye solution created in oil as described previously (21Guo X. Laflamme M Becker P.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and was typically 2–3% of the egg volume. Unless otherwise noted, caged IP3 and caged cADPr were loaded to intracellular concentrations greater than 10 μm. All experiments were performed at room temperature. All values reported in the text are the means ± S.E. Whole egg Ca2+ dye fluorescence was monitored with a high time resolution microfluorimeter previously described (21Guo X. Laflamme M Becker P.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were illuminated with 470 nm excitation light for a 2.5-ms interval every 7.5 ms, and fluorescence emission light (500–550 nm) was detected with a photomultiplier tube/photon counter circuit. The longer wavelength, nonratiometric dyes fluo-3 and CG-5N were used to avoid photolysis of the caged compounds by the fluorescence excitation light. To photolyze caged compounds, the output of a xenon flashlamp (Hi-tech, UK) was passed through a UG-5 filter to select for ultraviolet light and merged into the excitation light path of the microfluorimeter with a dichroic beamsplitter. The nominal flash lamp energy was set to 350 J, producing a light burst with a duration of ∼2 ms. Based on the [Ca2+] response to repeated flashes, we estimate that a single flash photolyzes approximately 15% of intracellular NP-EGTA. The fraction of caged cADPr and caged IP3 photolyzed by a single flash is unknown. Fluorescence emission intensity (FI) was used as an index of the intracellular [Ca2+], but no attempt was made to calibrate the fluorescence intensity to an actual concentration scale. In eggs injected with only minimal amounts of Ca2+chelators, we presume that the normal resting [Ca2+] was ∼150 nm based on estimates made by others in eggs studied under similar conditions (10Galione A. McDougall A. Busa W.B. Willmott N. Gillot I. Whitaker M. Science. 1993; 261: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 22Buck W.R. Hoffmann E.E. Rakow T.L. Shen S.S. Dev.

In eggs loaded with millimolar levels of the caged calcium NP-EGTA, the preflash resting [Ca2+] presumably was somewhere between the normal resting [Ca2+] and the free [Ca2+] of the injectate. NP-EGTA has a K d of 80 nm for Ca2+ in a solution with an ionic strength of 0.10–0.15m at pH 7.2 (24Ellis-Davies G.C. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Using this value, the injectate-free [Ca2+] would be estimated to have been 120 and 53 nm for Ca:NP-EGTA molar ratios of 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. However, most Ca2+ chelators, including EGTA, BAPTA, fluo-3, and CG-5N, have much lower affinities at higher ionic strengths and lower pH levels (25Harrison S.M. Bers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 925: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 26Harrison S.M. Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C1250-C1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Ukhanov K.Y. Flores T.M. Hsiao H.S. Mohapatra P. Pitts C.H. Payne R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 95-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For example, the affinity of EGTA for Ca2+ decreases 11-fold going from a 0.15m ionic strength solution at pH 7.2 to one of 0.6m ionic strength at pH 6.7 (the approximate cytosolic environment in sea urchin eggs (28Shen S.S. Steinhardt R.A. Nature. 1979; 282: 87-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)). If the affinity of the structurally similar NP-EGTA also decreases 11-fold under these conditions, the injectate-free [Ca2+] would be estimated to have been 1320 nm and 587 nm for the 0.6 and 0.4 Ca:NP-EGTA ratios, respectively. Sea urchins were purchased from Marinus, Inc. (Long Beach, CA). Caged cADPr (29Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), NP-EGTA, fluo-3, and CG-5N were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). cADPr was purchased from Amersham Corp., and caged IP3 was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. The kinetics of the Ca2+ release activated by flash photolytic production of cADPr were studied in intact eggs from the sea urchin L. pictus. Eggs were microinjected with caged cADPr (29Aarhus R. Gee K. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7745-7749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fluo-3 to approximately 10 and 5 μm, respectively, and subjected to a single brief high intensity flashlamp burst. As we have previously noted (21Guo X. Laflamme M Becker P.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the onset of rapid Ca2+ release after a single flash occurred only after a several hundred millisecond delay (Fig.1 A and Table I). Peak [Ca2+] generally was achieved in ∼4 s (Table I), and the [Ca2+] then gradually fell back to preflash levels over the next 60 s or so. The rise in [Ca2+] was initially quite slow but accelerated during the first 1–2 s after the flash. In many cases there was no detectable change in the fluo-3 fluorescence over the first 200 ms, but even when the fluorescence did increase during this period, its rate of rise eventually increased more than 100-fold. Thus, the rate of Ca2+ release appears to be less than 1% of its maximum for a significant period of time after the photoliberation of cADPr.Table IKinetics of [Ca 2+ ] transients induced by flash photolysis of caged cADPr or caged IP 3Peak F/F 0DelayMaximum dF/dtTime to half peakTime to peakmsF 0 /sssCaged cADPr (n = 14)4.3 ± 0.2446 ± 202.7 ± 0.31.17 ± 0.114.16 ± 0.40Caged IP3(n = 11)5.7 ± 0.41-aSignificantly different (p < 0.005) from caged cADPr.35 ± 31-aSignificantly different (p < 0.005) from caged cADPr.27.0 ± 2.41-aSignificantly different (p < 0.005) from caged cADPr.0.13 ± 0.011-aSignificantly different (p < 0.005) from caged cADPr.0.59 ± 0.031-aSignificantly different (p < 0.005) from caged cADPr.Sea urchin eggs were loaded with >5 μm caged cADPr or >3 μm caged IP3.1-a Significantly different (p < 0.005) from caged cADPr. Open table in a new tab Sea urchin eggs were loaded with >5 μm caged cADPr or >3 μm caged IP3. In contrast, [Ca2+] transients induced by photolysis of caged IP3 had a similar peak amplitude to those induced by cADPr (Fig. 1 B) but strikingly different kinetics. By a number of criteria, the overall response was roughly an order of magnitude faster (Table I). In particular, the onset of Ca2+ release occurred within 30 ms of the flash. Thus, the slow onset of Ca2+ release appears to be a characteristic specific to the cADPr-activated release mechanism, not of Ca2+ release in general. Several experiments were performed to determine whether delayed Ca2+ release was a consequence of our activation or detection methodology. The slow onset of Ca2+ release was still observed when the amount of fluo-3 loaded in eggs was decreased 50-fold to approximately 100 nm (Fig. 1 C), making it unlikely that this feature of the [Ca2+] transient was due to the presence of the Ca2+ dye. The characteristics of these cADPr-induced [Ca2+] transients were not affected by coloading eggs with heparin (200 μg/ml egg volume; data not shown), ruling out the possibility that the more rapid IP3-gated process was involved. Further, using an egg extract assay (30Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we found that caged cADPr (5 μm) did not increase the ED50 of cADPr to release Ca2+(data not shown), indicating that the caged compound does not interfere with cADPr binding. To assess whether the kinetics of the [Ca2+] transients were a consequence of submaximal or slow photoliberation of cADPr, we examined the dependence of the [Ca2+] transient amplitude and kinetics on the amount of caged-cADPr loaded into eggs. Fig.2 shows the peak amplitude and several kinetic descriptors of the [Ca2+] transients induced by cADPr and IP3, each plotted as a function of the estimated caged compound concentration. In eggs loaded with less than 5 μm of caged cADPr or less than 3 μm of caged IP3, the [Ca2+] transient kinetics and amplitude were dependent on the degree of caged compound loading. Thus, slower overall kinetics and a more pronounced delay in the onset of Ca2+ release can be observed, even in response to IP3, if the production of second messenger is limited. However, when loaded above these levels, the characteristics of the [Ca2+] transients were independent of the caged compound concentration, indicating that they were not a function of submaximal or slow photoliberation of cADPr. Therefore, based on all these observations, we conclude that these characteristics of the [Ca2+] transients reflect the intrinsic kinetic properties of the Ca2+ release process responding to the rapid appearance of a maximal cADPr concentration. The rapid activation observed with IP3 is consistent with the known ability of this second messenger to directly gate Ca2+ release channels (31Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). In contrast, the delayed release triggered by cADPr suggests a more complex activation scheme. Ca2+ has been shown to facilitate Ca2+ release triggered by submaximal cADPr concentrations (11Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the initially slow but progressively increasing rate of Ca2+release could reflect, at least in part, the progressive enhancement of cADPr activity as the [Ca2+] rises. Additionally, the slow onset of Ca2+ release might also reflect the intrinsic rate of the steps by which cADPr acts to open release channels, independent of Ca2+ facilitation. To determine the extent to which Ca2+ influenced the kinetics of cADPr-induced [Ca2+] transients, we manipulated the [Ca2+] in an attempt to alter Ca2+ feedback signals in situ. We first employed caged calcium to elevate the [Ca2+] coincident with cADPr liberation. NP-EGTA and Ca2+ were added to the injectate at a Ca:NP-EGTA molar ratio of 0.6 and coinjected into eggs along with caged cADPr. Total NP-EGTA loading was estimated to be approximately 1 mm. Because initial experiments employing fluo-3 showed near-saturation of this dye after NP-EGTA photolysis, we switched to the lower affinity dye CG-5N, which was loaded into eggs to a concentration of ∼20 μm. Under these conditions, a single flash produced a step [Ca2+] jump followed by a kinetically distinct secondary rise that occurred without appreciable delay or acceleration (Fig. 3 A). This secondary rise in [Ca2+] was not observed in the absence of caged cADPr (Fig. 3 B), indicating that it was not a result of direct Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Thus, in the presence of a permissive [Ca2+], cADPr can rapidly activate Ca2+ release without delay. Therefore, it is unlikely that delayed Ca2+ release under more physiological conditions is due to an intrinsically slow rate at which cADPr binds to and gates release channels. Due to uncertainty regarding the preflash resting [Ca2+] in the above experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”), we cannot rule out the possibility that a permissive [Ca2+] existed prior to the flash. Thus, there remained the question of how rapidly Ca2+ could act to facilitate cADPr-activated release. To address this, additional eggs were injected with a similar solution having a lower Ca:NP-EGTA molar ratio of 0.4. We presume that under these conditions the preflash resting [Ca2+] would be lower, as would the magnitude of the step change in the [Ca2+] resulting from a single flash. As expected, a single flash produced a smaller [Ca2+] jump and only a slow cADPr-dependent secondary [Ca2+] rise (Fig. 3 C). However, a second flash ∼2.5 s later jumped the [Ca2+] further, and the Ca2+ release rate immediately increased. The cADPr produced by the first flash was unlikely to be significantly degraded during this 2.5-s interval, particularly because, as will be described below, the onset of rapid calcium release could occur more than 10 s after a single flash in the presence of excess calcium buffers. Thus, the rapid increase in the Ca2+ release rate after the second flash likely can be ascribed to the elevated [Ca2+], not to a change in the cADPr concentration. We conclude that Ca2+ can also rapidly activate release if cADPr is present at a permissive concentration. If the acceleration of Ca2+ release was Ca2+-dependent, one would predict that the onset of rapid Ca2+ release could be prevented or postponed by attenuating the [Ca2+] rise with exogenous Ca2+ buffers. In fact, this outcome was suggested by the slow, nonaccelerating Ca2+ release observed following the first flash in the set of experiments illustrated by Fig. 3 Con eggs loaded with ∼1 mm of the Ca2+chelator NP-EGTA. No acceleration of Ca2+ release was observed if a second flash was not imposed under these conditions, and the [Ca2+] returned to resting levels within 30 s. To determine if a less potent Ca2+ buffer load would merely prolong the delay, an additional eggs were loaded with approximately 120 μm CG-5N as the only Ca2+ buffer. Under these conditions, the postflash delay before rapid cADPr-induced Ca2+ release was greatly prolonged (Fig.4 A) to a mean of 12.5 ± 3.5 s (n = 6). In contrast, these buffer conditions did not significantly alter the onset of IP3-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 4 B). These observations further confirm that the onset of rapid Ca2+ release is determined by the [Ca2+] and not the inherent speed by which photoliberated cADPr can gate open release channels. Flash photolysis of caged second messengers permits one to impose rapid, homogeneous increases in the second messenger concentration, eliminating intracellular diffusion and native production rates as determinants of the activation rate of target processes. As expected, the [Ca2+] transients induced by photolysis of caged cADPr in sea urchin eggs reported here were significantly faster than those induced by fertilization or by direct microinjection of cADPr reported by others (22Buck W.R. Hoffmann E.E. Rakow T.L. Shen S.S. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 30Dargie P.J. Agre M.C. Lee H.C. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Control experiments indicate that the kinetics of the [Ca2+] transients were not limited by our activation or detection methodology nor by the amount of cADPr liberated. Thus, the characteristics of the [Ca2+] transients appear to reflect the intrinsic kinetic properties of the Ca2+ release system responding to the rapid appearance of a maximally effective concentration of cADPr. In eggs loaded only with caged cADPr and fluo-3, the postflash rate of Ca2+ release was very low during the first 100–200 ms but then accelerated more than 100-fold over the next 1–2 s. Given that Ca2+ is known to facilitate cADPr-induced release (11Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to expect that positive Ca2+ feedback will contribute to this increase in release rate. The relatively slow initial rate of Ca2+ release could also be a consequence of the intrinsic rate of the cADPr and Ca2+ binding steps and/or of the gating process itself. However, we found that a step change in either the Ca2+ or cADPr concentration could lead to rapid and immediate activation of Ca2+ release when the other was present at a permissive concentration, indicating that the steps linking these messengers to release channel opening are not intrinsically slow. Thus, [Ca2+] appears to be the sole factor limiting Ca2+ release during the early postflash period, with acceleration of release reflecting positive feedback enhancement of cADPr activity by released Ca2+. This conclusion is reinforced by the finding that the onset of rapid Ca2+ release could be prevented or significantly delayed by the presence of excess exogenous Ca2+ buffers. Presumably calcium buffers are effective because they slow the [Ca2+] rise resulting from the initial release and perhaps limit the spatial range over which that Ca2+ can signal neighboring channels. Based on the observed initial rate of Ca2+ release, we estimate that the ability of cADPr to gate release channels in the presence of normal resting [Ca2+] to be less than 1% of its maximum at higher [Ca2+]. The precise concentration range over which Ca2+ modulates cADPr activity remains uncertain, due largely to uncertainty about the affinity of the Ca2+ dyes and chelators we employed in intact eggs (see “Experimental Procedures”). Furthermore, a Ca2+feedback site might be capable of sensing the locally higher [Ca2+] near open release channels and/or (in experiments employing NP-EGTA) the submillisecond transient [Ca2+] overshoots that immediately follow photolysis of caged calcium (32McCray J.A. Fidler-Lim N Ellis-Davies G.C. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8856-8861Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hence, even accurate calibration of the whole egg fluorescence signal might not allow the relevant [Ca2+] values to be determined. A more detailed description of the Ca2+dependence of cADPr action will require a more appropriate model preparation. Calmodulin, a required cofactor for cADPr-induced Ca2+release in sea urchin eggs (18Tanaka Y. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3244-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R. Gurnack M.E. Walseth T.F. Nature. 1994; 370: 307-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), is a possible candidate for mediating Ca2+-enhancement of cADPr activity. The very low activity of cADPr at normal resting [Ca2+], which suggests the involvement of a cooperative Ca2+ binding site, is a common feature of other processes regulated by this protein (33Vogel H.J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, there is evidence that at least one other divalent cation binding site is capable of enhancing cADPr activity in the absence of calmodulin (20Lee H.C. Aarhus R. Graeff R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9060-9066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, further investigation will be needed to establish the identity of the Ca2+ feedback site(s). Recently, Chini and Dousa (34Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) compared IP3- and cADPr-induced Ca2+ release from sea urchin egg extracts. They observed that both second messengers had a bell shaped [Ca2+] dependence, with IP3 having greater relative activity at lower [Ca2+]. Although they examined only the steady state Ca2+ dependence and used a rather low resolution [Ca2+] range (full log unit intervals), their data strongly suggest the existence of both sensitization and desensitization Ca2+ sites that regulate cADPr-mediated Ca2+ release. The actual Ca2+ dependence of cADPr activity reported by this group (no activity in the absence of Ca2+, maximum at 1 μm [Ca2+], and about 60% of maximum activity at 100 nm[Ca2+]) in egg extracts appears inconsistent with our estimate that cADPr activity in the intact egg was less than 1% of maximum at normal resting [Ca2+] (measured by others to be in the 150–200 nm range (22Buck W.R. Hoffmann E.E. Rakow T.L. Shen S.S. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 23Mohri T. Hamaguchi Y. Cell Struct. Funct. 1991; 16: 157-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)). Part of this discrepancy might reflect the experimental conditions Chini and Dousa employed in their study. Because cADPr action was determined in the steady state presence of [Ca2+], the Ca2+-dependent desensitization process likely would have attenuated the maximum release rate observed. In addition, the [Ca2+] range was examined only at full log unit intervals and so may have missed the optimal [Ca2+] having the greatest release rate. Underestimating the maximum Ca2+ release rate will tend to inflate estimates of the relative release rate at lower [Ca2+]. Nonetheless, full reconciliation of these independent estimates of cADPr activity at lower [Ca2+] will require further investigation. Recently, Genazzani et al. (35Genazzani A.A. Mezna M. Summerhill R.J. Galione A. Michelangeli F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7669-7675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) examined the kinetics of cADPr-induced Ca2+ release in sea urchin egg homogenates as a function of the cADPr concentration using a stop flow apparatus with a 25-ms time resolution. They reported an apparent acceleration of release in response to low, submaximal levels of cADPr, which they attributed to a Ca2+-dependent facilitation. However, in contrast to our observations in intact eggs, they observed no significant acceleration or delay of Ca2+ release in response to near maximal cADPr concentrations. The reason for this important difference in the behavior of Ca2+ release in these two models is not clear. A possible factor is that the homogenate extract is diluted 40-fold relative to its normal intracellular density, perhaps altering the normal spatial relations that permit efficient communication between neighboring channels. These relations might be critical if the [Ca2+] range needed for maximal cADPr action corresponds to local [Ca2+] levels achieved only near open release channels. We note that the rate of Ca2+ release from homogenates observed by these authors were quite slow (although typical of those reported by others in this model), and peak [Ca2+] was achieved more than a minute after addition of cADPr. Thus, it is possible that Ca2+release in this model occurs with little or no calcium facilitation. An understanding of the basis for these differences in the [Ca2+] transient kinetics of these two models could reveal important insights into the mechanism by which cADPr gates release. The sea urchin egg [Ca2+] transients we observed following photolysis of caged IP3 were immediate in onset and were resistant to the levels of exogenous Ca2+ buffers that compromised cADPr-induced release. Based on these qualitative assessments, IP3-mediated release appears less critically dependent on Ca2+ feedback. As noted previously, Chini and Dousa (34Chini E.N. Dousa T.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 709-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) found IP3 to be more effective than cADPr at releasing Ca2+ in egg extracts at lower [Ca2+]. However, other factors could also contribute to this apparent difference. Despite releasing similar amounts of Ca2+, the maximum rate of IP3-induced Ca2+ release was about 10-fold higher than that induced by cADPr (Table I). A 10-fold greater release flux, whether due to more channels or a larger conductance, would accelerate Ca2+feedback and help resist attenuation by exogenous Ca2+buffers, even if the initial fractional activity was the same. Functionally, a maximal effective concentration of cADPr appears merely to enable a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release pathway, with subsequent Ca2+ release critically dependent on a facilitating [Ca2+] signal. Lee (1Lee H.C. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 355-388PubMed Google Scholar) has proposed that the cADPr-gated release pathway can operate along a continuum between two extreme modes: a “modulator” mode at submaximal cADPr levels, where Ca2+ release is a function of the ambient [Ca2+] (thus permitting cADPr to amplify Ca2+signals generated by other mechanisms), and a “messenger” mode at high cADPr levels, where full Ca2+ release occurs independent of the ambient [Ca2+]. Our findings challenge a strict mechanistic description of this dual mode hypothesis. Full activation of release, even in the presence of maximal cADPr levels, required a facilitating [Ca2+] rise, and conditions that altered this Ca2+ signal changed the characteristics of the [Ca2+] transients. Nonetheless, from a functional perspective, our results are in accord with the dual mode hypothesis in sea urchin eggs. The initially slow postflash Ca2+ release was always sufficient to ignite a positive Ca2+ feedback that ensured eventual full activation of release. However, the inevitability of full Ca2+ release to a supramaximal cADPr signal in other cell types is not a given. In cells that have more active basal Ca2+ uptake processes, a lower resting [Ca2+], or a lower density of cADPr-gated channels, the initial release rate might be insufficient to initiate a positive Ca2+ feedback before the cADPr is degraded. Indeed, a cADPr-gated release pathway might play an essential role in shaping and amplifying Ca2+ signals induced by other mechanisms, yet go undetected under experimental conditions that interfere with or fail to provide a triggering Ca2+signal.

Several molecular chaperones present in the mitochondrial matrix appear to participate in both the translocation itself and the subsequent folding of the imported protein (9Glick B.S.

The hsp70 family of molecular chaperones is present in the cells of all organisms. Eukaryotes contain multiple hsp70s some of which are expressed constitutively while others are induced in response to metabolic stress. They participate in a variety of cellular processes, including folding of nascent polypeptides, assembly and disassembly of protein complexes, translocation of proteins across membranes, and protein degradation (12McKay D. Adv. Protein Chem. 1993; 44: 67-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3121) Google Scholar). All of these activities involve binding and release of unfolded polypeptides which are regulated by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP (14Hightower L.E. Sadis S.E. Takenaka I.M. Morimoto R.I.

Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). This ATPase activity resides in the highly conserved N-terminal domain of hsp70, whereas the peptide binding site is localized in the less well conserved C-terminal region (16Tsai M. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5958-5962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesmann M.E. Hendrikson W.A.

The three-dimensional structure of each isolated domain has been determined (17Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesmann M.E. Hendrikson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 18Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6261-6268Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Analysis of the specificity of hsp70 for binding of synthetic peptides indicates that exposed hydrophobic residues are generally required (20Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.-J.H. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar, 21Flynn G.C. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). This supports the initial suggestion that hsp70 function involves the binding of aggregation-prone hydrophobic regions that may become exposed in the surface of proteins under conditions of stress (22Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1986; 46: 959-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) or during nascent chain elongation (23Rothman J.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 591-603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear whether hsp70 is required for the correct folding of all nascent chains in the cytoplasm. Previous studies in HeLa cells suggested that most newly synthesized proteins interact with cytosolic hsp70 (24Beckmann R.P. Mizzen L.A. Welch W.J. Science. 1990; 248: 850-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). However, while this interaction was short-lived for some proteins, others remained complexed with hsp70 for considerably longer periods of time. The latter group might include proteins that require additional time to reach their native conformation, such as multimeric proteins or proteins that are post-translationally translocated to organelles. Others still might be able to fold without the collaboration of hsp70. The ability of hsp70 to recognize not just unfolded from folded states of a given protein but between unfolded proteins might contribute to the selective control of the folding of proteins in the cytosol. Unfortunately, very little attention has been directed at this aspect of the hsp70 function. Naturally occurring isozymes such as the cytosolic (cAAT) and mitochondrial (mAAT) forms of aspartate aminotransferase found in eukaryotes provide unique systems to address this question. A wealth of structural and functional information is available for several vertebrate aspartate aminotransferases (25Jansonius J.N. Vincent M.G. Jurnak F. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 187-285Google Scholar). These homodimeric, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes share a high degree of sequence similarity (about 63%) and an almost identical crystal structure (25Jansonius J.N. Vincent M.G. Jurnak F. McPherson A. Biological Macromolecules and Assemblies. 3. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1987: 187-285Google Scholar, 26Malashkevich V.N. Strokopytov B.V. Borisov V.V. Dauter Z. Wilson K.S. Torchinsky Y.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Each of the two identical active sites is composed of residues from both subunits; therefore, only the dimeric state shows catalytic activity. The two AAT isozymes are encoded by the nuclear genome and synthesized in free polysomes in the cytoplasm. After synthesis, cAAT remains in the cytoplasm while mAAT is post-translationally transported into the mitochondrial matrix. As most translocated mitochondrial proteins, rat liver mAAT is synthesized as a precursor (pmAAT) with a 29-residue targeting presequence at its N-terminal end (27Mattingly Jr., J.R. Rodriguez-Berrocal F.J. Gordon J. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the two isozymes show remarkably different folding behavior when expressed in in vitro translation systems (28Mattingly Jr., J.R. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26320-26327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysate, newly synthesized cAAT folds within the dead time of the experiment (in <5 min), whereas pmAAT folding proceeds at a very slow rate (t½ >1 h at 15 °C) (28Mattingly Jr., J.R. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26320-26327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, nascent pmAAT synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate was found transiently associated with hsp70 (29Lain B. Iriarte A. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Moreno J.I. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24732-24739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although hsp70 has affinity for binding to mitochondrial presequences (29Lain B. Iriarte A. Mattingly Jr., J.R. Moreno J.I. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24732-24739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Endo T. Mitsui S. Nakai M. Roise D. J.

Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), its interaction with pmAAT was independent of the presence of the presequence suggesting that hsp70 also binds to unfolded regions of the mature part of the precursor. By contrast, no cAAT could be detected in complex with hsp70 under identical conditions. These observations suggest that the folding of the two isozymes in the cytosol is selectively regulated. The folding of the translocated mitochondrial enzyme may be delayed to facilitate its efficient uptake by mitochondria while such a delay in folding would not be necessary for cAAT since it remains in the cytosol after translation. Several factors can be considered as responsible for the selective interaction of hsp70 with only the mitochondrial isozyme of AAT. These include the intrinsic folding rate of the polypeptide chain as proposed for the Escherichia coli chaperone SecB, which is involved in protein export (32Diamond D.L. Strobel S. Chun S.-Y. Randall L.L. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), or the conformational properties of certain intermediates along the folding pathway. To address this issue, we have now analyzed the interaction of the AAT isozymes with the constitutive cytosolic hsp70 (or hsc70) purified from bovine brain during their refolding in vitro from their acid-unfolded state. Only a single first-order rate-limiting step could be detected for the reactivation of cAAT. On the other hand, refolding of the mitochondrial enzyme is a multistep process that includes a non-native dimeric intermediate state. When present in the refolding medium, hsp70 binds to intermediate(s) along the folding pathway of mAAT but fails to interact with acid-unfolded cAAT. Binding of hsp70 to pmAAT is lost after the refolding protein forms assembly-competent monomers. These results indicate that, as observed for the proteins newly synthesized in cell-free extracts, hsp70 seems to have a preference for binding to the unfolded state of only the mitochondrial form of aspartate aminotransferase. The distinct refolding kinetics of the isozymes may contribute to the selective recognition of the mitochondrial protein by hsp70. Aspartic acid, cysteine sulfinic acid, and α-ketoglutarate were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were of the highest purity available. Published procedures were followed for the purification of pmAAT and cAAT and for the preparation of mature mAAT (28Mattingly Jr., J.R. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26320-26327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of the apoenzyme form (33Reyes A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stock solutions of the enzymes (0.2–0.4 mm) were prepared in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, by ultrafiltration (Centricon, 30,000 M r cut-off). Protein concentrations were estimated from the absorbance at 356 nm of the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate cofactor using a ε = 8,500 m−1cm−1 and M r = 46,597 for pmAAT andM r = 46,399 for cAAT. The enzyme activity was measured at 37 °C in a coupled assay with malate dehydrogenase, using l-aspartate and α-ketoglutarate as substrates as described previously (34Martinez-Carrion M. Turano C. Chiancone E. Bossa F. Giartosio A. Riva F. Fasella P. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2397-2409Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). hsp70 was purified from bovine brain following published procedures with minor modifications (35Welch W.J. Feramisco J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14949-14959Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine brains were homogenized in a Waring blender with 2 volumes of buffer A (10 mm Tris acetate, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5). Following centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min in a 19Ti rotor, the supernatant was chromatographed on a DE52 column using 150 mm NaCl in buffer A (buffer B) as elution buffer. The eluate was loaded directly on a hydroxylapatite column equilibrated with buffer A, and the proteins were eluted with 150 mmpotassium phosphate in buffer A. The fractions containing hsp70 were identified by SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions. After dialysis against buffer A, 5 mm magnesium acetate was added before loading the pooled fractions on an ATP-agarose column. After washing the column with 10 volumes of 1 m NaCl in buffer A followed by 3 volumes of buffer A, hsp70 was eluted with 3 mm ATP in buffer B. The excess of ATP was removed by precipitation with 80% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was resuspended in the minimum volume of buffer A and dialyzed extensively against the same buffer. The hsp70 preparation was over 95% homogeneous according to SDS-PAGE analysis. The functional state of hsp70 was assessed by testing its ability to arrest refolding of pmAAT (see “Results”). Protein concentration was measured using an ε280 = 47,800m−1 cm−1 (15Palleros D.R. Welch W.J. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5719-5723Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Stock solutions of hsp70 were kept at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.5, and remained active for up to 12 months. When a decrease in activity was observed upon storage, a partial recovery could often be achieved by addition of 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Reversible guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) or acid unfolding of the proteins was performed according to published procedures (33Reyes A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22281-22291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21990-21999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a stock solution of the enzymes in 2 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, was denatured by addition of either GdnHCl to achieve a final concentration of 4m or of diluted HCl to pH 2.0. The final protein concentration was 8.7 μm. The samples were then incubated for 90 min at 25 °C, conditions that were established previously to achieve maximum unfolding (36Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21990-21999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before initiation of refolding, unfolded protein samples were preincubated at 10 °C for 15 min. Refolding and reactivation of AAT was performed by dilution of the unfolded protein at 10 °C in refolding buffer (40 mmHepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5) to a final protein concentration of 0.1–1.8 μm. The dead time of the manual mixing was 15–20 s. When necessary, the refolding buffer contained 10 μm PLP or pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP). The recovery of activity was followed by measuring the enzyme activity of aliquots taken at different times after the initiation of refolding. When monitoring reactivation of the apoenzyme in the absence of coenzyme, the assay mixture was supplemented with 10 μm PLP. The enzymatic activity was followed during less than 30 s to ensure that no significant increase in activity occurs during the determination. Reactivation data are expressed as percentage relative to the activity of a sample of native enzyme maintained under identical conditions. To study the effect of hsp70 on the refolding of the enzymes, different concentrations of hsp70 were added to the refolding mixture either previous to the addition of the unfolded proteins or at different times after the initiation of refolding. A method based on the formation of heterodimers between pmAAT and mAAT (36Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21990-21999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used to monitor dimer formation during refolding. Refolding reactions containing 1.8 μm pmAAT or mAAT were started in refolding buffer at 10 °C as described above. At different times after starting the reactions, equal volumes of the refolding samples were mixed and incubated for an additional 120 min at 10 °C to allow complete refolding. After removing the small amount of aggregated material by centrifugation, an equal volume of a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerophosphoglycerol:1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (3:1) liposome preparation was added to the supernatant and incubated at room temperature to allow binding of the precursor-containing dimers. The bound protein was then separated by centrifugation on a Beckman airfuge equipped with an A-100 30° rotor, at 60 p.s.i. for 20 min. The pellet, containing the hybrid dimer and precursor homodimer, was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie Blue, the intensity of the protein bands present in the pellets was quantified with a Personal Densitometer Scanner (Molecular Dynamics). Control experiments performed using different known concentrations of mAAT indicated that the amounts of protein loaded on the SDS-PAGE gels (0.5–1.5 μg) were well within the linear range for both stain binding and instrument response (at least 0.1–2.5 μg). The supernatant, containing the mature homodimers, was assayed for enzymatic activity. Liposomes were prepared in refolding buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl as already described (36Artigues A. Iriarte A. Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21990-21999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recovery of native fluorescence during refolding was followed in a SLM 8000 C Aminco spectrofluorometer, using photon counting mode, by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence emission at 338 nm after excitation at 280 nm. Usually 4-nm slits were used for both excitation and emission. Refolding was also followed by monitoring the appearance of specific dichroic signals that are characteristic of the native protein but are absent in the acid-unfolded species. All measurements were made in a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter, using either 1- or 0.1-cm cuvettes thermostated at 10 °C. The acquisition of native secondary structure was monitored at 222 nm, and the binding of PLP to the active site during refolding was followed by monitoring the appearance of a strong Cotton effect due to the PLP centered at 356 nm (37Martinez-Carrion M. Tiemeier D.C. Peterson D.L. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 2574-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The values of molar ellipticity at 222 nm (θ) were obtained by using the expression (θ) = (θ′/10)m/lc, where m is the mean residue molecular weight (114), l is the path length of the sample solution, c is the protein concentration in g/ml, and θ′ is the direct value from the instrument. The units of (θ) are degree cm2 dmol−1. The complex between hsp70 and refolding pmAAT was isolated by centrifugation on a top-bench centrifuge (Marathon 14K/M, Fisher Instruments) at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, and the pellet and supernatant were analyzed on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. After staining with Coomassie Blue, the fraction of protein present in the pellet was estimated from the intensity of the protein bands determined using a Molecular Dynamics Scanner. While no hsp70 precipitated in the absence of pmAAT, a small fraction of pmAAT (∼10%) was recovered in the pellet of refolding reactions containing no hsp70. The intensity of the pmAAT band coprecipitating with hsp70 was in each case corrected for this hsp70-independent aggregation. Reactivation and CD356 nm data were fit to the following sequential first-order reaction (Reaction 1), Ak1→Bk2→C REACTION 1where A is the initial state, B an intermediate, and C the final state. The concentration ofA, B, and C will change with time according to Equations Equation 1, Equation 2, Equation 3, [A] t=Rexp(−k1t)Equation 1 [B] t=Rk1[exp(−k1t)−exp(−k2t)]/(k2−k1)Equation 2 [C] t=R[1−exp(−k1t)−k1(exp(−k1t)−exp(−k2t))/(k2−k1)]Equation 3 in which R is the total change of the variable being measured, and [A] t, [B] t, and [C] t are the concentrations of A,B, and C at time t, respectively. Nonlinear least squares fitting of the data to Equation 3 was performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the commercial program SigmaPlot 2.0 (Jandel Corp.) to estimate the parameters R,k 1, and k 2. The initial estimates of the rate constants could be varied by as much as 100%, either simultaneously or independently, and the fitting routine still converged on identical values of the kinetic parameters. Thus, these parameters represent a global minimum in the fitting procedure. A time course of the kinetic mechanism shown in Reaction 2 (see “Discussion”) was simulated using the KINSIM program (38Frieden C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and the rate constants for reactivation of the PLP form of pmAAT are shown in Table I, assuming diffusion controlled rates for the bimolecular steps and that activity is recovered only with the final phase of folding. The kinetic trace obtained coincided with the continuous line shown in Fig. 1 A for the reactivation of pmAAT which represents the best fit of a single set of experimental data to Equation 3. The other kinetic data presented in this work were fit to a single exponential curve using the SigmaPlot program. The quality of the fit was judged by visual analysis of scatter diagrams of the residuals (difference between the experimental and fitted values) and by calculating the χ2 statistic (39Straume M. Johnson M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) using the Minitab program (Minitab Inc.) to verify whether there are significant differences between the experimental and calculated data.Table IRate constants for the refolding of pmAATDetermined byk 1 (min−1)k 2(min−1)Enzyme activity Apoenzyme0.665 ± 0.340 (3)0.078 ± 0.021 (3) PMP-enzyme0.387 ± 0.070 (3)0.071 ± 0.019 (3) PLP-enzyme0.405 ± 0.015 (11)0.038 ± 0.013 (11)Dimer formation1-aData obtained only for the refolding of the PLP enzyme.0.289 ± 0.091 (3)Intrinsic fluorescence1-bλex = 280 nm, λem = 338 nm.

Martinez-Carrion M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21990-21999Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or cAAT at pH 2.0 results in an almost instantaneous loss of activity. When the pH of a sample of acid-unfolded enzyme is returned to neutrality by rapidly diluting an aliquot of the unfolded enzyme in refolding buffer at 10 °C, much of the original catalytic activity is recovered (65–85%). The catalytic properties as well as the absorbance, fluorescence, and circular dichroism spectra (far-UV and visible) of the refolded proteins are identical to those of the native form (data not shown). The yield of reactivation of either isozyme is dependent on the final protein concentration. At 10 °C the optimal protein concentration ranges from 0.6 to 1.8 μm, with typical yields of about 65–75% of the original activity for the mitochondrial enzyme and slightly higher for the cytosolic isozyme. At higher protein concentrations the yield of reactivation decreases, most likely due to increased aggregation of the protein. The yield of reactivation is also considerably reduced for the apoenzyme or the PMP forms of the enzyme. However, since the yi"
https://openalex.org/W1985815464,"Depolarization of rat brain synaptosomes causes an increase in phosphorylation of serine residues 573, 610, 623, and 687 on voltage-sensitive sodium channels. Although these sites have been shown to be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vitro and in situ, the depolarization-induced increase in their state of phosphorylation is not due to increased cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity, but requires calcium influx and protein kinase C. Since phosphorylation at this cluster of sites inhibits sodium current and would decrease neuronal excitability, this may be an important negative feedback mechanism whereby calcium influx during prolonged or repetitive depolarization can attenuate neuronal excitability and prevent further calcium accumulation. Phosphorylation of purified channels by protein kinase C decreases dephosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites by purified calcineurin or protein phosphatase 2A. This suggests that one mechanism by which protein kinase C may increase phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites in sodium channels is to inhibit their dephosphorylation. This represents an important new mechanism for convergent regulation of an ion channel by two distinct signal transduction pathways.

Sodium influx through voltage-sensitive sodium channels is responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in most neurons, and ultimately promotes the opening of voltage-sensitive calcium channels at the synapse, leading to calcium influx and exocytosis. Because of their central role in these processes, the response properties of sodium channels can control neuronal excitation and secretion.

West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Two electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that neurotransmitters modulate sodium channel function via second messenger-induced phosphorylation. Stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors in dissociated rat nigrostriatal neurons reduces sodium current in a cAMP-dependent manner (7Surmeier D.J. Kitai S.T. Prog. Brain Res. 1993; 99: 309-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Stimulation of muscarinic receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons, via activation of PKC, also reduces sodium current (8Cantrell A.R. Ma J.Y. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1019-1026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).The α subunit of brain sodium channels is phosphorylated by PKA on multiple serine residues clustered in a single intracellular loop between homologous domains I and II of the channel protein (9Rossie S. Gordon D. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17530-17535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Rossie S. Catterall W.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 27355-27362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of this loop with the corresponding loop from a skeletal muscle sodium channel lacking these phosphorylation sites abrogates the cAMP-mediated inhibition of channels expressed in Xenopusoocytes (12Smith R.D. Goldin A.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1965-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, this intracellular segment contains all phosphorylation sites necessary for cAMP-dependent inhibition of brain sodium channels. Li and co-workers (6Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) found that the effect of 8-bromo-cAMP on sodium current could not be observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing sodium channels without prior activation of PKC. Ser-1506, located in the intracellular loop between homologous domains III and IV, was the critical phosphorylation site for PKC in causing this effect (6Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, sodium channels are a target for convergent regulation by two distinct second messenger-regulated pathways causing phosphorylation in two different regions of the channel protein. Although PKC-mediated channel phosphorylation appears to be a prerequisite for cAMP-dependent reduction in sodium current, it is not known whether PKC phosphorylation alters the sodium channel's response to cAMP-dependent phosphorylation or whether it alters the channel's susceptibility to phosphorylation or dephosphorylation at cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites.In the present study, we observed that depolarization of rat brain synaptosomes caused a calcium-dependent increase in phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on sodium channels. This response was not due to increased PKA activity, but required activation of PKC. These results suggest that accumulation of calcium and activation of PKC in nerve terminals may lead to increased phosphorylation and consequent decreased responsiveness of sodium channels. We also found that purified reconstituted sodium channels phosphorylated by both PKC and PKA were poorly dephosphorylated by purified calcineurin or PP2A, in contrast to sodium channels phosphorylated by PKA alone. This observation suggests one potential mechanism by which PKC activation during synaptosome depolarization could lead to an increase in phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on sodium channels. The ability of one phosphorylation site on a given substrate to control dephosphorylation of a separate site represents a potentially important molecular mechanism for conditional or convergent regulation of the responses of ion channels and other phosphoproteins by distinct signal transduction pathways.DISCUSSIONThis study suggests that an important physiologic stimulus, neuronal depolarization, influences the responsiveness of voltage-dependent brain sodium channels by controlling the state of phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites. In addition, two novel aspects of the role of PKC in controlling sodium channel phosphorylation are revealed; PKC is required for the effect of synaptosomal depolarization on sodium channel phosphorylation, and the direct phosphorylation of purified sodium channels by PKC reduces the ability of phosphatases to attack cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites in vitro.Thus, activation of PKC influences the extent of phosphorylation at cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on voltage-sensitive sodium channels in brain.The mechanism by which depolarization increases sodium channel phosphorylation is not known. Our results with purified sodium channels suggest that a PKC-induced decrease in channels' susceptibility to dephosphorylation could play a role in elevating phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on sodium channels in response to depolarization. However, the circumstances in synaptosomes are complex due to the presence of multiple Ser/Thr phosphatases and second messenger-regulated kinases, and other mechanisms may also lead to increased sodium channel phosphorylation. These include the possibility that PKC itself or a kinase activated by PKC directly phosphorylates cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on sodium channels in situ, and the possibility that activation of PKC may decrease phosphatase activity in synaptosomes. For example, PKC has been shown to phosphorylate and inhibit calcineurin in vitro (35Hashimoto Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16524-16529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a recent study suggests that activation of PKC may modulate PP2A activity in cardiac myocytes (36Quintaje S.B. Church D.J. Rebsamen M. Valloton M.B. Hemmings B.A. Lang U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These potential mechanisms remain to be investigated in synaptosomes.Although it is not clear whether the role of PKC in the depolarization-induced elevation of sodium channel phosphorylation is due to a direct phosphorylation of sodium channels or is indirect, it is unlikely that PKC acts solely by promoting calcium influx or membrane depolarization. Although PKC inhibition during synaptosome depolarization decreases calcium influx and membrane depolarization to a moderate extent (37Coffey E.T. Sihra T.S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21060-21065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of synaptosomes with phorbol ester has little or no effect on calcium levels (38Chandler L.J. Leslie S.W. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 39Barrie A.P. Nicholls D.G. Sanchez-Prieto J. Sihra T.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or membrane depolarization (39Barrie A.P. Nicholls D.G. Sanchez-Prieto J. Sihra T.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and does not enhance either of these responses to treatment with high potassium (37Coffey E.T. Sihra T.S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21060-21065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, PMA increased sodium channel phosphorylation in the absence of a depolarizing stimulus, conditions under which calcium elevation is not expected (38Chandler L.J. Leslie S.W. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,39Barrie A.P. Nicholls D.G. Sanchez-Prieto J. Sihra T.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although the effect of PMA was prevented by incubating synaptosomes in a calcium-free medium, the loss of responsiveness may be explained by a depletion of calcium in synaptosomes during treatment with calcium-free buffer containing EGTA. Others have demonstrated that PKC can phosphorylate different synaptosome substrates depending on the means of activation (40Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PKC directly phosphorylates sodium channels during depolarization, the phosphorylation of Ser-1506 should be measured. Although phosphorylation of this site in vivo has not yet been examined, it is phosphorylated by PKC but not PKA in vitro(20Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16129-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and this site plays a key role in the electrophysiological effects of PKC on sodium channels (6Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar).In addition to its essential role in initiating exocytosis, depolarization-induced calcium influx can modulate the subsequent excitability of the synaptic terminal by activating a host of calcium-dependent enzymes which can alter ion channel function (41Augustine G.J. Charlton M.P. Smith S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 633-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Trimble W.S. Linial M. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 93-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation at cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites inhibits brain sodium channels, the enhanced state of channel phosphorylation after depolarization would be expected to inhibit subsequent synaptic excitation, decreasing further calcium influx and secretion. However, a number of studies suggest that activation of PKC enhances neurosecretion (reviewed in Refs. 39Barrie A.P. Nicholls D.G. Sanchez-Prieto J. Sihra T.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 43Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 613-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). One possible explanation reconciling these two views may be that rapid or early PKC-mediated phosphorylation events enhance secretion, whereas the increase in channel phosphorylation at cAMP-dependent sites that we observe may require periods of repetitive or sustained depolarization. Early PKC-mediated events may include the phosphorylation of sodium channels at Ser-1506. Phosphorylation at this site slows channel inactivation and would be expected to prolong depolarization and promote calcium influx. Thus, one possible scenario may be that depolarization and calcium influx activates PKC, which phosphorylates a number of target proteins, including sodium channels on Ser-1506, enhancing neurosecretion. During repetitive or prolonged depolarization, the phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites is gradually enhanced due to increased phosphorylation, decreased dephosphorylation, or both. This leads to inhibition of sodium channels during subsequent depolarizing stimuli. This may represent a negative feedback mechanism by which neurons are protected from accumulating dangerously high levels of calcium during periods of prolonged depolarization or hyperexcitation.Several cases have been described in which phosphorylation of one site on a given substrate controls the phosphorylation of another site (44Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although fewer examples of one phosphorylation site controlling the dephosphorylation of a separate phosphorylation site have been reported, several important cases have recently been described. These include an enhanced rate of phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation in the presence of a nearby phosphothreonine residue on mitogen-activated protein kinase by dual-specificity phosphatases (45Guan K.-L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 46Denu J.M. Zhou G. Wu L. Zhao R. Yuvaniyama J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Siciliano J.C. Greengard P. Girault J.-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2682-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and the resistance to dephosphorylation of PKCα induced by phosphorylation of Thr-638 (48Bornancin F. Parker P.J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1114-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Such interaction between phosphorylation sites represents an important molecular mechanism for the conditional regulation of a given response. Our results with purified sodium channels suggest that the ability of phosphatases to dephosphorylate cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on sodium channels is modulated by PKC phosphorylation of the channel itself. This effect may contribute to the convergent regulation of sodium channel function by PKC and PKA, observed in electrophysiological studies (6Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and to the increased phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites during synaptosomal depolarization. Since PKC phosphorylation of Ser-1506 is critical for cAMP-dependent inhibition of sodium channel function (6Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), it will be important to learn if phosphorylation of Ser-1506 is responsible for the effect on dephosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites observed in vitro. Sodium influx through voltage-sensitive sodium channels is responsible for the initiation and propagation of action potentials in most neurons, and ultimately promotes the opening of voltage-sensitive calcium channels at the synapse, leading to calcium influx and exocytosis. Because of their central role in these processes, the response properties of sodium channels can control neuronal excitation and secretion.

Such interaction between phosphorylation sites represents an important molecular mechanism for the conditional regulation of a given response. Our results with purified sodium channels suggest that the ability of phosphatases to dephosphorylate cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on sodium channels is modulated by PKC phosphorylation of the channel itself. This effect may contribute to the convergent regulation of sodium channel function by PKC and PKA, observed in electrophysiological studies (6Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and to the increased phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites during synaptosomal depolarization. Since PKC phosphorylation of Ser-1506 is critical for cAMP-dependent inhibition of sodium channel function (6Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), it will be important to learn if phosphorylation of Ser-1506 is responsible for the effect on dephosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites observed in vitro. This study suggests that an important physiologic stimulus, neuronal depolarization, influences the responsiveness of voltage-dependent brain sodium channels by controlling the state of phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites. In addition, two novel aspects of the role of PKC in controlling sodium channel phosphorylation are revealed; PKC is required for the effect of synaptosomal depolarization on sodium channel phosphorylation, and the direct phosphorylation of purified sodium channels by PKC reduces the ability of phosphatases to attack cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites in vitro.Thus, activation of PKC influences the extent of phosphorylation at cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on voltage-sensitive sodium channels in brain. The mechanism by which depolarization increases sodium channel phosphorylation is not known. Our results with purified sodium channels suggest that a PKC-induced decrease in channels' susceptibility to dephosphorylation could play a role in elevating phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on sodium channels in response to depolarization. However, the circumstances in synaptosomes are complex due to the presence of multiple Ser/Thr phosphatases and second messenger-regulated kinases, and other mechanisms may also lead to increased sodium channel phosphorylation. These include the possibility that PKC itself or a kinase activated by PKC directly phosphorylates cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites on sodium channels in situ, and the possibility that activation of PKC may decrease phosphatase activity in synaptosomes. For example, PKC has been shown to phosphorylate and inhibit calcineurin in vitro (35Hashimoto Y. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16524-16529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a recent study suggests that activation of PKC may modulate PP2A activity in cardiac myocytes (36Quintaje S.B. Church D.J. Rebsamen M. Valloton M.B. Hemmings B.A. Lang U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These potential mechanisms remain to be investigated in synaptosomes. Although it is not clear whether the role of PKC in the depolarization-induced elevation of sodium channel phosphorylation is due to a direct phosphorylation of sodium channels or is indirect, it is unlikely that PKC acts solely by promoting calcium influx or membrane depolarization. Although PKC inhibition during synaptosome depolarization decreases calcium influx and membrane depolarization to a moderate extent (37Coffey E.T. Sihra T.S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21060-21065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), treatment of synaptosomes with phorbol ester has little or no effect on calcium levels (38Chandler L.J. Leslie S.W. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 39Barrie A.P. Nicholls D.G. Sanchez-Prieto J. Sihra T.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) or membrane depolarization (39Barrie A.P. Nicholls D.G. Sanchez-Prieto J. Sihra T.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and does not enhance either of these responses to treatment with high potassium (37Coffey E.T. Sihra T.S. Nicholls D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21060-21065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, PMA increased sodium channel phosphorylation in the absence of a depolarizing stimulus, conditions under which calcium elevation is not expected (38Chandler L.J. Leslie S.W. J. Neurochem. 1989; 52: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,39Barrie A.P. Nicholls D.G. Sanchez-Prieto J. Sihra T.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although the effect of PMA was prevented by incubating synaptosomes in a calcium-free medium, the loss of responsiveness may be explained by a depletion of calcium in synaptosomes during treatment with calcium-free buffer containing EGTA. Others have demonstrated that PKC can phosphorylate different synaptosome substrates depending on the means of activation (40Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether PKC directly phosphorylates sodium channels during depolarization, the phosphorylation of Ser-1506 should be measured. Although phosphorylation of this site in vivo has not yet been examined, it is phosphorylated by PKC but not PKA in vitro(20Murphy B.J. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16129-16134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and this site plays a key role in the electrophysiological effects of PKC on sodium channels (6Li M. West J.W. Numann R. Murphy B.J. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1439-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In addition to its essential role in initiating exocytosis, depolarization-induced calcium influx can modulate the subsequent excitability of the synaptic terminal by activating a host of calcium-dependent enzymes which can alter ion channel function (41Augustine G.J. Charlton M.P. Smith S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 633-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Trimble W.S. Linial M. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 93-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation at cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites inhibits brain sodium channels, the enhanced state of channel phosphorylation after depolarization would be expected to inhibit subsequent synaptic excitation, decreasing further calcium influx and secretion. However, a number of studies suggest that activation of PKC enhances neurosecretion (reviewed in Refs. 39Barrie A.P. Nicholls D.G. Sanchez-Prieto J. Sihra T.S. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and 43Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 613-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). One possible explanation reconciling these two views may be that rapid or early PKC-mediated phosphorylation events enhance secretion, whereas the increase in channel phosphorylation at cAMP-dependent sites that we observe may require periods of repetitive or sustained depolarization. Early PKC-mediated events may include the phosphorylation of sodium channels at Ser-1506. Phosphorylation at this site slows channel inactivation and would be expected to prolong depolarization and promote calcium influx. Thus, one possible scenario may be that depolarization and calcium influx activates PKC, which phosphorylates a number of target proteins, including sodium channels on Ser-1506, enhancing neurosecretion. During repetitive or prolonged depolarization, the phosphorylation of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites is gradually enhanced due to increased phosphorylation, decreased dephosphorylation, or both. This leads to inhibition of sodium channels during subsequent depolarizing stimuli. This may represent a negative feedback mechanism by which neurons are protected from accumulating dangerously high levels of calcium during periods of prolonged depolarization or hyperexcitation. Several cases have been described in which phosphorylation of one site on a given substrate controls the phosphorylation of another site (44Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although fewer examples of one phosphorylation site controlling the dephosphorylation of a separate phosphorylation site have been reported, several important cases have recently been described. These include an enhanced rate of phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation in the presence of a nearby phosphothreonine residue on mitogen-activated protein kinase by dual-specificity phosphatases (45Guan K.-L.

It was shown that (i) when SMP were treated with the complex III inhibitor myxothiazol (or MOA-stilbene or stigmatellin) or with KCN and ascorbate to reduce the high potential centers of complex III (iron-sulfur protein and cytochromes c + c 1), NADH or succinate reduced heme b L slowly and incompletely. In contrast, heme b H was reduced by these substrates completely and much more rapidly. Only when the complex III inhibitor was antimycin, and the high potential centers were in the oxidized state, NADH or succinate was able to reduce bothb H and b L rapidly and completely. (ii) When NADH or succinate was added to SMP inhibited at complex III by antimycin and energized by ATP, the bis-heme cytochromeb was reduced only partially. Prereduction of the high potential centers was not necessary for this partial breduction, but slowed down the reduction rate.

The inhibition by either reagent was incomplete, and heme b L(b 566) was oxidized through the leak allowed by either inhibitor at least 10 times faster than hemeb H (b 562). (ii) Cytochrome b of complex III could be partially reduced via cytochrome c 1 and the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) by ascorbate, or faster and to a greater extent by ascorbate plus TMPD. This reaction was inhibited more strongly by antimycin than by myxothiazol (see also Ref. 6Miki T. Miki M. Orii Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1827-1833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (iii) Ascorbate or ascorbate plus TMPD could also partially reduce b in ubiquinone-depleted bovine heart SMP, in which the molar ratio of Q10 to complex III monomer had been reduced 200-fold from 12.5 to 0.06, or in SMP from a Q-deficient yeast mutant. These results agreed with the finding of others that in bovine or yeast complex III the removal of Q by extraction did not impair the oxidation of b via ISP/c 1 by ferricyanide (7Degli Esposti M.

(iv) Our results also showed that antimycin and myxothiazol, which exert their maximal inhibition at concentrations stoichiometric to complex III monomer, each inhibited three reactions of the bis-heme cytochrome b, all incompletely. The strongest effect by either reagent was inhibition of electron transfer from heme b H to hemeb L; next was inhibition of the reoxidation ofb L via ISP/c 1; and least was inhibition of substrate (NADH or succinate) reduction ofb, which is known to require the combined actions of both antimycin and myxothiazol (1Matsuno-Yagi A.

In these regards, HQNO (at 20–40 μm) behaved similarly to antimycin, and MOA-stilbene and stigmatellin similarly to myxothiazol (1Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It should be added here that the oxidation of reduced b H andb L or their reduction by reverse electron transfer via ISP/c 1 was not inhibited to a greater extent when SMP were treated with both antimycin and myxothiazol (1Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The above results were summarized in a scheme, which is reproduced in Fig. 1 A. It was emphasized that this scheme serves only to present our new results in graphic form and should not be considered as a new hypothesis for the mechanism of electron transfer by complex III. The reason for emphasizing this point was that Fig. 1 A does not explain an important feature of complex III, namely the oxidant-induced extra reduction of cytochrome b, which was a major consideration in the design of the Q-cycle (Fig. 1 B) (9Mitchell P.

SMP were prepared from bovine heart mitochondria in the presence of 1.5 mm ATP during sonication as described previously (13Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14424-14427Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (15Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduction of cytochrome b was monitored spectrophotometrically at 563 minus 575 nm in a buffer containing 0.25m sucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. SMP concentration was 1.2–1.3 mg/ml. Results were essentially the same at 565 minus 575 nm. Reduction of cytochromes c + c 1 was monitored at 550 minus 540 nm. At this wavelength pair, interference due to the absorbance changes of the b hemes was negligible. KCN, ascorbic acid (neutralized with NaOH), TMPD, deoxycholate (neutralized with KOH) were added where indicated at 10 mm, 0.4 mm, 5 μm, and 0.05%, respectively. Inhibitors of complex III were added from an ethanolic solution at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Ethanol concentration never exceeded 1%. Absorbance changes and spectra were recorded using an SLM DW2000 dual wavelength spectrophotometer. The data shown were collected and stored in a computer on line to the spectrophotometer. Assay temperature was 30 °C unless otherwise stated. According to the Q-cycle hypothesis (Fig. 1 B), QH2 at the QO site delivers one electron to ISP, 2H+ to the outside, and one electron to b L. Electron transfer to ISP must occur first, so that Q⋅ −, which is considered to be the electron donor tob L, is generated. Therefore, if ISP is prereduced and antimycin is added to prevent b reduction via the Qi site, QH2 or a respiratory substrate should be unable to rapidly reduce the two b hemes (2Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, as will be seen, our results are difficult to reconcile with this expectation. The experiments were carried out with bovine heart SMP for the reasons stated previously (1Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and the reduction of cytochrome b was monitored at 563 minus 575 nm. The particles were treated with KCN to inhibit cytochrome oxidase, and 0.4 mm neutralized sodium ascorbate was added to reduce cytochromes c and c 1. In control experiments, the reduction of c + c 1by ascorbate was monitored spectrophotometrically, and the time required after ascorbate addition to achieve complete reduction ofc + c 1 was determined before proceeding with the experiments reported here. Fig. 2, traces A and B, show the results with antimycin as the complex III inhibitor. It is seen in Fig.2 A that addition of succinate to SMP, pretreated with KCN, ascorbate and antimycin, resulted in rapid reduction of cytochromeb followed by a slow further reduction. When shortly after the start of the slow phase, ferricyanide was added to oxidizec + c 1, the slow reduction phase was changed to a rapid one (Fig. 2 B). This ferricyanide-induced effect is what is known as the oxidant-induced extra reduction of cytochrome b, which was observed in the early studies on complex III (16Rieske J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 145: 179-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 17Chance B. Ernster L. Estabrook R.W. Slater E.C. Dynamics of Energy-Transducing Membranes. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1974: 553-578Google Scholar) and subsequently rationalized in the design of the Q cycle (2Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

It may be noted, however, that the initial rapid reduction of cytochrome b by succinate does not agree with the Q cycle. Fig. 2 C shows an experiment similar to that of Fig.2 B, except that the complex III inhibitor used here was myxothiazol, instead of antimycin. It is seen that upon addition of succinate a biphasic reduction of cytochrome b was observed, again with an initial rapid phase followed by a slow phase. When ferricyanide was added at the plateau of the slow reduction phase, a rapid partial oxidation of cytochrome b took place, corresponding in extent to the slow reduction phase. This was followed by a slow re-reduction (Fig. 2 C). Spectral analyses showed that the succinate-induced rapid initial reduction phase was due mainly to the reduction of b H (Fig. 3 dashed trace, λmax at ∼563 nm), and that the ferricyanide-induced oxidized heme, in addition to c +c 1, was b L (Fig. 3, solid trace, cytochrome b λmax at ∼566 nm). When myxothiazol was omitted in an experiment similar to that of Fig.2 C, addition of succinate to KCN + ascorbate treated SMP resulted in a biphasic b reduction essentially identical to the biphasic b reduction phase of Fig. 2 C (data not shown). In addition, data similar to those of Fig. 2 were obtained when, instead of succinate, NADH was used as the reductant, except that in an experiment similar to that of Fig. 2 B it was necessary for the molar equivalent of NADH to be greater than that of ferricyanide. Otherwise NADH was rapidly oxidized by ferricyanide at the level of complex I, resulting in b oxidation. Another point of clarification regarding the effects of antimycin and myxothiazol on the redox reactions of the b hemes of complex III is afforded by the data of Fig. 4. In these experiments, no KCN and ascorbate were added. The oxidation of cytochrome b was blocked by antimycin in Fig. 4, trace A, and by myxothiazol in Fig. 4, trace B. It is seen that addition of succinate resulted in a rapid and complete reduction of the b hemes in the presence of antimycin, and in a biphasic and incomplete reduction of these hemes in the presence of myxothiazol. The difference in the spectra of the plateau regions oftraces A and B, shown in Fig. 4, trace C, indicated that the heme incompletely reduced in the presence of myxothiazol was b L (Fig. 4, trace C, λmax at ∼566 nm). Previous results of others have shown a slow reduction of bothb L and b H in preparations pretreated with antimycin and ascorbate (±TMPD). In one case, a succinate-cytochrome c reductase preparation was used (18Bowyer J.R. Trumpower B.L. FEBS Lett. 1980; 115: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) (see also Ref. 19Bowyer J.R. Edwards C.A. Trumpower B.L. FEBS Lett. 1981; 126: 93-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which had been obtained by fractionating the mitochondria in the presence of 10 mg of cholate per ml (20Trumpower B.L. Simmons Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4608-4616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In another case, CO-treated mitochondria were used in the absence or presence of 6.7 mm ascorbate, with 0.3 mmsuccinate as the electron donor and 3–30 mm malonate, which greatly inhibited succinate oxidation (17Chance B. Ernster L. Estabrook R.W. Slater E.C. Dynamics of Energy-Transducing Membranes. Elsevier Science, Amsterdam1974: 553-578Google Scholar). Respiration was then initiated by flash photolysis of the CO-inhibited cytochrome oxidase. We have also found that 5–10 times higher ascorbate concentrations than used in our experiments diminished the rate ofb H reduction in experiments as in Fig. 2. However, as mentioned earlier, ascorbate concentrations higher than 0.4 mm were not necessary to achieve complete reduction ofc + c 1 in the above experiments. Another point that requires further explanation here concerns the data of Fig. 2 C, where it is seen that addition of ferricyanide to SMP, pretreated with KCN, ascorbate, myxothiazol, and succinate, resulted in reoxidation of the b L component of the reduced cytochrome b. In other experiments, it was found that this partial b reoxidation by ferricyanide took place also with either MOA-stilbene or stigmatellin as the complex III inhibitor and regardless of whether the SMP were pretreated with KCN and ascorbate (data not shown). Furthermore, as seen in Fig.5, when cytochrome b was reduced in myxothiazol-treated SMP, then antimycin was added to block electron transfer from succinate to b, subsequent addition of ferricyanide resulted in the reoxidation of bothb L and b H. Similar results were obtained with intact SMP in the absence of deoxycholate (0.05%, see legend to Fig. 2) in the reaction mixture. It is possible that modification of cytochrome b by myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene, or stigmatellin makes it susceptible to oxidation by ferricyanide. In addition, the data of Figs. 2 C, 3, and 5indicate that b H is in rapid electronic communication with complexes I and II regardless of whether the complex III inhibitor is antimycin or myxothiazol, even when c +c 1 are prereduced. In other words, the rate ofb H reduction by succinate appears to supersede that of its oxidation (directly or indirectly) by ferricyanide. These data are in complete agreement with our previous results, which showed that the step most strongly inhibited by antimycin or myxothiazol is electron transfer from b H tob L (1Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Together, the above results also indicate that only in the presence of antimycin isb L rapidly and completely reducible by substrates, and that this rapid substrate reduction ofb L in the presence of antimycin can be inhibited by prereduction of the high potential centers of complex III. In an experiment such as that of Fig. 2 B, it was necessary to treat SMP with a detergent to allow ferricyanide access to c +c 1 on the interior surface of the SMP vesicles. Therefore, for uniformity, all the experiments of Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5 were carried out in the presence of the minimal necessary amount (0.05%) of deoxycholate. Under these conditions, 0.4 mm ascorbate was sufficient to completely reduce c +c 1, and the addition of TMPD was not necessary. In the experiments to be reported in this section, intact, well coupled SMP were used. Under these conditions, it was necessary to add TMPD (5 μm) together with 0.4 mm ascorbate to achieve complete reduction of c + c 1. As seen in Fig. 6, SMP were treated with KCN, antimycin, ascorbate, and TMPD. Then ATP was added to energize the system, and NADH was added to reduce the b hemes of complex III. Cytochrome b reduction was monitored, as before, at 563 minus 575 nm. It is seen that the addition of NADH resulted in partial reduction of cytochrome b, and subsequent addition of the uncoupler FCCP resulted in greater b reduction. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the order of addition of ATP and NADH could be changed, with NADH added before ATP. A greater reduction of b was achieved when NADH was added in the absence of ATP, but subsequent ATP addition caused partial b oxidation, which was reversed upon addition of FCCP. Similar results were obtained when the respiratory substrate was succinate instead of NADH (Fig.7 B), or when the complex III inhibitor was myxothiazol instead of antimycin (data not shown), except that in these cases the extent of reoxidation of b induced by ATP addition was less. Spectral analysis of the plateau regions of Fig. 7 Asuggested that the component remaining reduced after ATP addition is mainly b L (λmax at 564.5 nm). Fig.8, A and B, shows experiments similar to Fig. 7, A and B, except that myxothiazol was added where indicated before (Fig. 8 A) or after (Fig. 8 B) the addition of ATP. It is seen that the combination of antimycin and myxothiazol prevented the ATP-induced reoxidation (Fig. 8 A) and the FCCP-induced re-reduction (Fig. 8 B) of cytochrome b. In view of the known fact that the combination of antimycin and myxothiazol inhibits the rapid reduction of b H andb L by QH2 (1Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 2Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Brandt U. Trumpower B. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the data of Fig. 8 suggest that in the absence of myxothiazol ATP addition results in reverse electron transfer from the b hemes to the Q pool, and uncoupling in the reversal of this process. The experiment of Fig. 6 is somewhat analogous to that of Fig.2 B in the sense that in an antimycin-treated system substrate-induced reduction of the cytochrome b of complex III was partially inhibited, then the partial inhibition was reversed by the addition of ferricyanide in Fig. 2 B, and of FCCP in Fig. 6. However, the fact that prereduction of c +c 1 is not required for the ATP/uncoupler effect is shown in Fig. 9. In this experiment SMP were treated only with antimycin. Then ATP was added, followed by NADH. It is seen that NADH addition resulted in partial, but in this case more rapid,b reduction, and subsequent addition of oligomycin to inhibit ATP hydrolysis (or uncoupler, data not shown) resulted in further b reduction. Then, after exhaustion of NADH, cytochrome b was oxidized in a biphasic manner, as demonstrated previously (1Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 21Hatefi Y. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 1982; 24: 6614-6618Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, by analogy to the phenomenon of oxidant-induced extra reduction of cytochrome b, which is rationalized by the design of the Q cycle, one could term the results of Fig. 6 and 9 as deenergization-induced extra reduction of cytochrome b. However, as will be discussed below, it is also difficult to rationalize the data of Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9 on the basis of the Q cycle hypothesis. The results of two sets of experiments have been reported here. One set concerns substrate reduction of hemes b Hand b L in SMP under conditions that boxidation was inhibited by antimycin or myxothiazol, and the high potential centers of complex III (ISP and c +c 1) were prereduced by ascorbate. In the second set, the effect of SMP energization and deenergization on the reduction of b H and b L was explored under conditions that b oxidation was inhibited by antimycin or myxothiazol, and the high-potential centers of complex III were either prereduced or not. In the first set of experiments, it was found that when myxothiazol was the complex III inhibitor addition of succinate or NADH resulted in rapid and complete reduction of b H, and slow and incomplete reduction of b L, regardless of whether or not c + c 1 were prereduced (Figs. 2 C and 4 B). Similar results on the substrate reduction of b H andb L were obtained in the absence of myxothiazol when c + c 1 were prereduced (data not shown). The ferricyanide reoxidation data of Fig. 2 Cindicated that when the inhibitor was myxothiazol, ferricyanide oxidized only the partially reduced b L, but notb H. However, when antimycin was added after succinate (Fig. 5), and the combination of myxothiazol and antimycin inhibited electron transfer from succinate to b, then ferricyanide rapidly oxidized both b L andb H. These results suggested that, under the conditions of Fig. 2 C, ferricyanide was still capable of oxidizing both b hemes. However, in this case the rate ofb H reduction, but not ofb L reduction, by succinate superseded its rate of oxidation (directly or indirectly) by ferricyanide. This interpretation of the data of Figs. 2 C, 3, and 5 agrees with our previous finding that the strongest inhibition exerted by myxothiazol (or antimycin) is on electron transfer fromb H to b L (1Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The biphasic reduction of the b hemes in the experiment of Fig. 2 C, including the partial reduction ofb L, can also be explained by the Q cycle, because with only myxothiazol as the complex III inhibitor (or when myxothiazol was absent, but c + c 1were prereduced) the Qi site of the Q cycle would still be open for reduction of the b hemes, and the lowerE M of b L would be responsible for its slow and partial reduction viab H. However, when SMP were pretreated with KCN, ascorbate and antimycin (the Qi site inhibitor of the Q cycle), addition of succinate or NADH also resulted in a much faster reduction of b H than b L(Fig. 2 A). These results are still compatible with those shown in Fig. 1 A, but not with the Q cycle (Fig.1 B), because under the conditions of Fig. 2 A both the QO and the Qi pathways for breduction would be inhibited, and neither b L norb H should have been rapidly reduced. In summary, the results of the first set of experiments suggest that prereduction of ISP/c 1 results mainly in inhibition of the reduction of b L by NADH or succinate. This effect is similar to that of myxothiazol (or MOA-stilbene or stigmatellin). It differs from the effect of myxothiazol in that the combination of myxothiazol and antimycin severely inhibits substrate reduction of b H as well, but the combination of prereduced ISP/c 1and antimycin does not (Fig. 2 A). Comparing Fig. 2,A and C, it also seems that the combination of ISP/c 1 prereduction and antimycin addition has a greater (additive?) effect on the inhibition ofb L reduction than the combination of ISP/c 1 prereduction and myxothiazol addition. The second set of experiments (Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9) have shown that in antimycin-treated SMP energization by ATP alters the manner in which NADH or succinate reduces the b hemes of complex III. Only partial b reduction occurred in ATP-energized SMP, but subsequent addition of an uncoupler or oligomycin (to inhibit ATP hydrolysis) resulted in further b reduction (Figs. 6 and 9). Prereduction of c + c 1 was not necessary for partial b reduction in ATP-energized SMP, nor for further b reduction upon SMP deenergization. However, prereduction of c + c 1 did lower the rate at which b was reduced by substrates. The effect of SMP energization and deenergization on the extent of b reduction could also be seen after the b hemes had been reduced by NADH or succinate (Fig. 7). Furthermore, addition to the antimycin-treated SMP of myxothiazol before or after ATP addition inhibited the subsequent effects of energization and deenergization (Fig. 8), suggesting that energization results in partial boxidation by the Q/QH2 pool and deenergization in furtherb reduction by the same source. Analysis of the spectra of the plateau regions of the experiment of Fig. 7 A before and after ATP addition suggested that the b heme remaining reduced after ATP addition was mainly b L (major α peak λmax at 564.5 nm), which agrees with early reports that energization of mitochondria by ATP raises the apparentE M of b L to +245 mV at pH 7.0 (22Wilson D.F. Dutton P.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1970; 39: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 23Chance B. Wilson D.F. Dutton P.L. Erecinska M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 66: 1175-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The altered redox properties of cytochrome bin energized SMP merit detailed investigation, because this transmembranous component of complex III may be involved in proton translocation (Fig. 1 A). The results shown in Figs. 6, 7, 8, 9 are difficult to reconcile with the Q cycle hypothesis. One would expect on the basis of the Q cycle that substrate reduction of b would be inhibited in SMP treated with antimycin to block the Qi site; with KCN, ascorbate and TMPD to reduce ISP/c 1 and prevent the single-electron oxidation of QH2; and with ATP which by creating a protonmotive force should inhibit QH2deprotonation at the QO site. However, our results shown in Fig. 6 (see also Figs. 7 and 8) are not compatible with this expectation. Furthermore, one would expect from the Q cycle that in a system such as above reverse electron transfer from b would also be inhibited. This expectation is again not fulfilled by our results (Figs. 7 and 8). By contrast, the results of Figs. 6, 7, 8 are not inconsistent with Fig. 1 A, because in the presence of either antimycin or myxothiazol the path of electrons between the Q pool and the b hemes would be open, and ATP-induced reverse electron transfer would be expected to register on the redox state of cytochromeb. In conclusion, the data presented here make it difficult to rationalize the phenomenon of oxidant-induced extra reduction of cytochromeb on the basis of the Q cycle hypothesis. This phenomenon appears to result from two conditions: (a) presence of antimycin (or HQNO), because only under this condition can bothb H and b L be completely reduced by substrates and (b) oxidized state of ISP/c 1 (or absence of myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene, or stigmatellin), because otherwise b L would be slowly and incompletely reduced by substrates. Therefore, when condition (a) is fulfilled and restriction (b) is removed, b L (as well asb H) becomes reduced by substrate faster and to a greater extent. The reason for the partial and slow reduction ofb L when c + c 1are prereduced or when complex III is treated with myxothiazol, MOA-stilbene or stigmatellin remains to be investigated. So does the reason for partial b reduction under the energized conditions of Fig. 6. Therefore, although Fig. 1 A is more consistent than the Q cycle (Fig. 1 B) with the results presented here and previously (1Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6164-6171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), much remains to be done before a complete picture emerges. The anticipated crystal structure of bovine complex III (24Xia D. Yu C.A. Deisenhofer J. Xia J.-Z. Yu L. Biophys.

A genomic/cDNA clone was constructed that specified a secretable human fibronectin NH2 fragment. With the use of site-directed mutagenesis a set of 29 kDa fragments was obtained that contained glycine or glutamic acid residues in place of basic residues at various candidate sites for heparin binding in the five type I modules that make up the domain. The recombinant fragment containing the wild type sequence had a nearly normal circular dichroic spectra and a melting profile, as assayed by loss of ellipticity at 228 nm, that was indistinguishable from that of the native fragment obtained by trypsinization of plasma fibronectin. A substantial proportion of the wild type recombinant fragment bound to heparin-Sepharose, where it was eluted at the same NaCl concentration as the native fragment. The wild type fragment was capable of promoting matrix-driven translocation, a morphogenetic effect in artificial extracellular matrices that depends on the interaction of the fibronectin NH2 terminus with heparin-like molecules on the surfaces of particles. Mutant fragments in which arginines predicted to be most exposed in the folded fragment were converted to glycines retained the same affinity for heparin as the wild type fragment. In contrast, a mutant fragment in which the single basic residue (Arg99) in the minor loop (“Ω-loop”) of the second type I module was converted to a glycine had an essentially normal melting profile but exhibited no binding to heparin and failed to promote matrix-driven translocation. A mutant fragment in which the single basic residue (Arg52) of the first type I module was converted to a glycine also completely lacked heparin binding activity, but one in which the single basic residue (Arg191) the fourth type I module was converted to a glycine retained the ability to bind heparin. A mutant fragment in which the single basic residue (Lys143) in the Ω-loop of the third type I module was converted to a glutamic acid lacked heparin binding activity but had a CD spectrum similar to the heparin-liganded native protein and was capable of promoting matrix-driven translocation. The results indicate that multiple residues in the Ω-loops of the fibronectin NH2-terminal domain participate in its interactions with heparin. In addition, the conformation of one of the nonbinding mutants may mimic the heparin-induced structural alteration in this fibronectin domain required for certain morphogenetic events.

Fibronectin, an adhesive glycoprotein of the blood plasma and extracellular matrix, contains two distinct sites with affinity for the glycosaminoglycan heparin (see Refs. 1Mosher, D. F.

The other heparin-binding site, Hep1, is coincident with fibronectin's compact, trypsin-resistant, 29-kDa amino-terminal domain.

Previous studies have suggested that the heparin binding capability of the 29-kDa NH2-terminal domain of fibronectin (FnNTD) 1The abbreviations used are: FnNTD, fibronectin 29-kDa NH2-terminal domain; Wt, wild type; MDT, matrix-driven translocation; kbp, kilobase pair; TPCK, tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. also helps mediate the cellular condensation process that occurs at sites of incipient chondrogenesis in the precartilage mesenchyme of the developing vertebrate limb (17Hall B.K. Miyake T. Anat. Embryol. 1992; 186: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar,18Newman S.A. Tomasek J.J. Structure and Function of Extracellular Matrices of Connective Tissues.in: Comper W.D. 2. Gordon & Breach, London1996Google Scholar). In particular, the formation of condensations in high density cultures of precartilage mesenchyme was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody directed against the FnNTD and by tri- or tetrapeptides containing Gly-Arg-Gly (19Frenz D.A. Jaikaria N.S. Newman S.A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), a conserved, repeated motif of the FnNTD (2Hynes R.O. Fibronectins. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Crossref Google Scholar) that represents a putative determinant of the heparin binding capacity of this domain (20Jaikaria N.S. Rosenfeld L. Khan M.Y. Danishefsky I. Newman S.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Moreover, cell-sized polystyrene latex beads coated with heparin, when mixed with limb mesenchymal cells, accumulated at fibronectin-rich sites of cellular condensation during early chondrogenesis in vitro, but beads coated with dextran sulfate did not. This redistribution of heparin-coated beads was also inhibited by the anti-FnNTD antibody and by Gly-Arg-Gly (21Frenz D.A. Akiyama S.K. Paulsen D.F. Newman S.A. Dev. Biol. 1989; 136: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the condensing limb bud mesenchyme the presumed heparin-like ligand for the FnNTD is the cell surface heparan sulfate-containing proteoglycan, syndecan, which, like fibronectin, is abundant at sites of precartilage condensation (22Gould S.E. Upholt W.B. Kosher R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3271-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The morphogenetic potential of the interaction between the FnNTD and heparin-like molecules was also demonstrated in experiments that assayed for matrix-driven translocation (MDT), a morphological reorganization that occurs when an artificially constructed extracellular matrix containing heparin-coated polystyrene beads is placed adjacent to similar matrix containing fibronectin (23Newman S.A.

Under the conditions of the assay the FnNTD was the only domain of fibronectin both necessary and sufficient for MDT to occur (24Newman S.A. Frenz D.A. Hasegawa E. Akiyama S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Science. 1985; 228: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or when tri- or tetrapeptides containing Gly-Arg-Gly were used as competitors of the bead-fibronectin interaction (20Jaikaria N.S. Rosenfeld L. Khan M.Y. Danishefsky I. Newman S.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and was greatly reduced when FnNTDs were used in which more than four arginines were blocked by the chemical agent 1,2-cyclohexanedione (20Jaikaria N.S. Rosenfeld L. Khan M.Y. Danishefsky I. Newman S.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This degree of chemical modification also essentially eliminated the heparin binding capacity of this fibronectin domain (20Jaikaria N.S. Rosenfeld L. Khan M.Y. Danishefsky I. Newman S.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It was concluded from these studies that the arginines (and possibly a lysine) in the highly flexible minor loops of the FnNTD type I modules (25Baron M. Norman D. Willis A. Campbell I.D. Nature. 1990; 345: 642-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) were likely sites of interaction with heparin. Because none of the individual minor loops contains a canonical heparin binding site (26Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and limited internal cleavage of the major loops by cyanogen bromide destroyed the MDT promoting activity of the FnNTD (20Jaikaria N.S. Rosenfeld L. Khan M.Y. Danishefsky I. Newman S.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it was further suggested that cooperation among multiple minor loops is required for the interaction of this fibronectin domain with heparin (20Jaikaria N.S. Rosenfeld L. Khan M.Y. Danishefsky I. Newman S.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). (Following Leszczynski and Rose (27Leszczynski J.F. Rose G.D. Science. 1986; 234: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), we refer to these small, compact loops as “Ω-loops”). In the present study we have tested these inferences directly by producing recombinant FnNTDs with site-directed modifications that eliminated one or more basic side chains at sites predicted to be the most highly exposed in the human FnNTD and at the somewhat less exposed sites in the Ω-loops of modules I-1, I-2, I-3, and I-4. We found, as predicted from the earlier chemical modification studies, that elimination of arginines outside the Ω-loops had no effect on heparin binding of the FnNTD, whereas modifications of the single basic residues in the Ω-loops of I-1, I-2, or I-3 eliminated all of the fragment's heparin binding activity. The mutant fragments containing either or both of the alterations in the Ω-loops of I-2 and I-3 were tested as well for ability to promote the MDT in vitromorphogenetic effect and, by CD, for retention of native conformation in the absence and the presence of heparin. Two of these mutant fragments were incapable of promoting MDT, as expected. However, the fragment mutated in the Ω-loop of I-3, in which a positively charged side chain was replaced by a negatively charged one, retained the ability to promote MDT, despite the virtual elimination of its heparin binding activity. The CD measurements suggested that in this case the mutation may have thrown the fragment into its “morphogenetically active” conformation. The results indicate that basic residues in the Ω-loops of the FnNTD are decisive in heparin binding and some morphogenetic effects mediated by this domain and suggest that loop-loop interactions may play a role in these processes. Human plasma fibronectin was obtained from the New York Blood Center and exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline (0.02 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.15 mNaCl) and used directly or after being digested with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Worthington) as described (28Hayashi M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3332-3340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified beef lung heparin was generously provided by the late Dr. Isidore Danishefsky. Rat monoclonal antibody 304, reactive against the FnNTD (24Newman S.A. Frenz D.A. Hasegawa E. Akiyama S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Genomic DNA clone pgHF3.7, encoding the human fibronectin promoter, secretory signal sequence, and the initial portion of the FnNTD (30Dean D.C. Bowlus C.L. Bourgeois S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84 (2nd Ed.): 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), was a gift from Dr. Douglas Dean (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Oligonucleotides for sequencing and site-directed mutagenesis were synthesized in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (New York Medical College) or purchased from Gene Link, Inc. (Thornwood, NY). Sf21 insect cells were obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) and maintained in shaker flasks in serum-free insect cell culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Type I collagen was obtained by acetic acid extraction of tail tendons of young adult rats and kept frozen at −20 °C as described (23Newman S.A. Frenz D.A. Tomasek J.J. Rabuzzi D.D. Science. 1985; 228: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The collagen was dialyzed into acidified 1:10 strength Ham's F-12 medium without bicarbonate (Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA) before being used in the MDT assay (23Newman S.A. Frenz D.A. Tomasek J.J. Rabuzzi D.D. Science. 1985; 228: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar,24Newman S.A. Frenz D.A. Hasegawa E. Akiyama S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4791-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Clone pFNs54 was constructed from two pre-existing clones as follows. (i) Human fibronectin cDNA clone pFH6 (29Kornblihtt A.R. Vibe-Pedersen K. Baralle F.E. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) was digested with EspI and BamHI, yielding a 1.2-kbp fragment encoding the initial 54 kDa of the mature protein. (ii) Human genomic clone pgHF3.7 (30Dean D.C. Bowlus C.L. Bourgeois S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84 (2nd Ed.): 1876-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) containing the 5′ end of the fibronectin gene, including a small region of overlap with pFH6, was digested with PstI andEspI, yielding a 291-base pair fragment containing the complete signal sequence and a 3′ terminus at the same position as the 5′ terminus of the fragment generated from pFH6. The two fragments were ligated at their common EspI site and cloned into thePstI-BamHI site of pUC18 (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), yielding the plasmid pFNs54, specifying a secretable form of the NH2-terminal 54 kDa of the mature fibronectin protein. The 1.5-kbp PstI-BamHI fibronectin cDNA fragment was excised from pFNs54 and used for single-stranded (Ref. 32Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar; Sculptor kit version 2.1, Amersham Corp.) or double-stranded (Ref. 33Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar; Chameleon kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) site-directed mutagenesis. Mutagenic oligonucleotides were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and annealed with the target sequences. Seven different mutants were made; the corresponding mutagenic oligonucleotides used (with the mutated base underlined) and the predicted amino acid changes are as follows: M1, 5′-TCTCCCTCCCCCAGCCCC-3′ for Arg99 → Gly99; M2, 5′-ATTCTCCTTCTCCATTACC-3′ for Lys143 → Glu143; in M1+2, the second of the above substitutions was made in a clone in which the first substitution had already been made, yielding a clone that encoded both Gly99 and Glu143; M3, 5′-GGAGGAAGCGGAGGTTTTAACTGCG-3′ for Arg52 → Gly52; M4, 5′-GGTGACACCTGGGGGGGACCACATGAGACTGG-3′ for Arg124-Arg125 → Gly124-Gly125; M5, 5′-GGCAGCGGAGGCATCACTTGC-3′ for Arg191 → Gly191; M6, 5′-GCACTTCTGGAAATGGATGCAACGATCAGG-3′ for Arg197-Asn198-Arg199 → Gly197-Asn198-Gly199. The presence of the desired mutations was confirmed by the dideoxy sequencing method using the Sequenase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with appropriate primers. The 1.5-kbp PstI-BamHI wild type and mutant fibronectin cDNA fragments were ligated into the polylinker region of the Baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Pharmingen, Inc., San Diego, CA) in the same orientation as the polyhedrin protein promoter (34O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vectors: A Laboratory Manual. Oxford University Press, Oxford1994Google Scholar). Co-transfection of Sf21 insect cells was carried out using linearized Baculovirus DNA (Baculogold, Pharmingen) and recombinant fibronectin/pVL1392 DNA in calcium chloride solution. The transfected cells were grown in serum-free insect cell culture medium at 27 °C for 4 days, at which time the recombinant viruses were amplified to obtain a high titer stock (1 × 108 viral particles/ml). Subsequent transfections were done in both T-flask and shaker flask culture at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10. The infected cells were grown for 3 or more days, after which the supernatant was harvested, centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min, and cleared by an additional 10 min of centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Supernatants were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels (35Blattler D.P. Garner F. van Slyke K. Bradley A. J. Chromatogr. 1972; 64: 147-155Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar) by Coomassie Blue staining or after electrotransfer to nitrocellulose by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody 304 (24Newman S.A. Frenz D.A. Hasegawa E. Akiyama S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4791-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody to confirm and estimate the level of expression of the FnNTDs. The cleared culture supernatants were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 25 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA for 2 days, changing the buffer every 8 h. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) or, after purification of fibronectin fragments, by absorbance at 280 nm using a specific extinction coefficient of 12.8 (37Mosesson M.W. Umfleet R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5728-5736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To generate the 29-kDa FnNTDs, the 54-kDa recombinant fibronectin NH2-terminal fragments were digested with TPCK-treated trypsin at a fibronectin:trypsin ratio of 500:1 at 25 °C for 15 min, followed by addition of phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm (28Hayashi M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3332-3340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digested protein was further dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 25 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride. The dialyzed samples were passed through a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The wild type recombinant FnNTD, like the native fragment obtained by digesting plasma fibronectin (28Hayashi M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3332-3340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was not bound and was recovered from the prewash. For some experiments the wild type fragment was further purified by affinity chromatography on heparin-Sepharose (see below). Mutant fragment M4 was eluted from DEAE-cellulose with 100 mm NaCl, M2 and M5 were eluted with 150 mm NaCl, and M1, M1+2, M3, and M6 were eluted with 200 mm NaCl. The mutant proteins were purified away from contaminating species by gel filtration chromatography using Sephacryl-100 followed, where required, by fast protein liquid chromatography with a Superose-12 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Protein samples used in analytical experiments were >95% pure by the criterion of relative intensity of the 29-kDa band to other species on Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels. CD measurements in the far UV region (200–250 nm) were carried out on a Jasco model 500C spectropolarimeter equipped with a microcell holder, ADLAB-PC adapter, and ADAPT program (Interactive Microware, State College, PA). Spectra were obtained in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature with a time constant of 16 s, a sensitivity of 0.1 millidegree/cm and a scan rate of 5 nm/min in a cuvette with an optical path length of 0.1 cm. Protein concentrations were in the range of 0.32–0.48 mg/ml. When heparin was present, the weight ratio of heparin to protein was 0.005–0.025, and the signal for heparin alone in the same buffer, though minimal, was corrected for. The data were collected at 0.2 nm intervals, and the average of 10 scans was reported. Melting curves were obtained by monitoring ellipticity at 228 nm while heating a jacketed cell of the same path length, 0.1 cm, at 1 °C/min. A mean residue molecular weight of 112 was used in the calculations of ellipticity. Secondary structures were estimated from CD data using the fixed reference method (CDESTIMA program) of Yang et al. (38Yang J.T. Wu C.S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). The ellipticity at each nm from 240 to 200 nm was used in the CDESTIMA analysis, as described (39Samuel M. Samuel E. Villanueva G.B. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The reference spectra were pure component spectra extracted from CD analysis of proteins with structures previously determined by x-ray diffraction. Heparin-Sepharose mini-columns (Pharmacia) were equilibrated with 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl. Each purified FnNTD (0.2 ml; 0.11–0.22 mg/ml) was loaded onto a column, and a gradient of 50–750 mm NaCl in the same buffer was applied at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance of the column effluent at 280 nm was monitored with a flow cell. This assay was performed as described previously (23Newman S.A. Frenz D.A. Tomasek J.J. Rabuzzi D.D. Science. 1985; 228: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24Newman S.A. Frenz D.A. Hasegawa E. Akiyama S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4791-4795Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, “primary gels” were constructed by suspending polystyrene latex beads (6 μm, Polysciences, Warrington, PA; final concentration, 5 × 106/ml) in a cooled, soluble collagen solution (1.7–3.5 mg/ml), which was simultaneously adjusted to physiological pH and ionic strength with concentrated Ham's F-12 medium and sodium bicarbonate. “Secondary gels” consisted of an identical collagen solution with or without 6 μm/ml FnNTD or one of its mutant variants. Drops of primary and secondary gel were placed contiguously on a plastic Petri dish, and the subsequent movement, or lack thereof, of beads and surrounding matrix across the original interface was recorded. Because certain commercially fabricated polystyrenes are well established mimics of heparin in MDT (20Jaikaria N.S. Rosenfeld L. Khan M.Y. Danishefsky I. Newman S.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1538-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and other protein binding assays (40Jozefonvicz J. Jozefowicz M. J. Biomater. Sci. Polym. Ed. 1990; 1: 147-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,41Boisson-Vidal C. Jozefonvicz J. Brash J.L. J. Biomed. Mater. Res. 1991; 25: 67-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), uncoated beads having this property were used in most of these experiments. The modular organization of fibronectin is shown schematically in Fig.1, along with the relative positions of the fragments used in these studies. Sf21 insect cells infected with recombinantBaculovirus containing ∼1.5-kbp human fibronectin genomic/cDNA inserts derived from pFNs54 (Fig.2 A) were grown in serum-free medium where they secreted protein fragments corresponding to the first 54 kDa of the mature fibronectin molecule. These fragments were digested with trypsin and purified to yield wild type and mutant FnNTDs (Fig.2 B). Wild type (Wt) recombinant FnNTD was produced using the parental insert from pFNs54 and contained a nucleotide sequence that encoded the protein sequence of the first five type I modules (I-1–5) of human fibronectin (42Garcia-Pardo A. Pearlstein E. Frangione B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), plus I-6 and the protein's two type II modules (II-1 and II-2) (Fig. 1). Mutant 1 (M1) encoded an Arg → Gly substitution at the tip of the minor loop of module I-2 (amino acid 99 from the mature NH2 terminus). M2 encoded a Lys → Glu substitution at the corresponding position in module I-3 (amino acid 143), and M1+2 encoded both of these substitutions. M3 and M5 encoded Arg → Gly substitutions near the tips of the minor loops of modules I-1 (amino acid 52) and I-4 (amino acid 191), respectively. M4 encoded a Gly-Gly substitution for the Arg-Arg in the large loop of module I-3 (amino acids 124 and 125), and M6 encoded Arg → Gly substitutions for both of the arginine residues flanking an asparagine residue in the protein strand connecting the small loop of module I-4 with the large loop of module I-5 (amino acids 197 and 199) (Fig. 3). Sequencing of several hundred nucleotides to either side of the mutant sites disclosed no changes other than the desired mutations.Figure 2Production of"

This type of oligosaccharide contains β-1,2-linked mannose units attached to an α-1,3-linked mannose unit, the presence of which has been demonstrated in the cell wall mannans of Saccharomyces kluyveri (16Zhang W.

The β-1,2 linkage-containing oligomannosyl side chains are the specific epitopes of the mannans of the genus Candida and have not been found in mammalian cells. Therefore, the detection of such an antigen in the sera from patients using immunological procedures is useful for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis. Furthermore, several workers reported that the β-1,2 linkage-containing side chains participate in the adherence of fungal cells to host cells during the initial step of Candidainfection (20Miyakawa Y. Kuribayashi T. Kagaya K. Suzuki M. Nakase T. Fukasawa Y. Infect. Immum. 1992; 60: 2493-2499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Li R.-K. Cutler J.E. J. Biol.

Consequently, it is meaningful to characterize the β-1,2-mannosyltransferases responsible for the formation of the functional side chain. In a previous study (22Suzuki A. Takata Y. Oshie A. Tezuka A.

Although we tried to detect the β-1,2-mannosyltransferase I responsible for the transfer of the first β-1,2-linked mannose unit to the α-1,2-linked mannotetraose to synthesize antigenic factor 6, we could not detect the activity in the homogenate of C. albicans serotype A cells. Therefore, we tried to detect another β-1,2-mannosyltransferase responsible for the formation of the antigenic factor 9, which have been found in the mannan of C. guilliermondii (18Shibata N.

The pyridylamination of the oligosaccharide was performed using the method of Yamamoto et al. (29Yamamoto S. Hase S. Fukuda S. Sano O. Ikenaka T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1989; 105: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) as follows: to an oligosaccharide (1 mg), 600 μl of a 2-aminopyridine solution prepared by dissolving 1 g of 2-aminopyridine in 0.65 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added. After being sealed, the tube was heated at 90 °C for 10 min. The tube was then opened, and 60 μl of the supernatant of a mixture of 100 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride and 60 μl of water, as the reducing reagent, was added. The tube was resealed and heated at 90 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with 2 ml of water and applied to a column (1 × 50 cm) of Toyopearl HW-40 and separated from free 2-aminopyridine by elution with 0.01 mammonium acetate, pH 6.0. The preparation of the mannosyltransferase fraction of C. guilliermondii strain cells was carried out by the method described in a previous paper (22Suzuki A. Takata Y. Oshie A. Tezuka A. Shibata N. Kobayashi H. Okawa Y. Suzuki S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 373: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) as follows. The cells were grown in the YPD medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1% peptone, and 2% glucose) at 28 °C until the mid-logarithmic growth phase (A 600 = ∼6). The cells were then harvested and washed with 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, by centrifugation. The cells (about 40 g of wet cells) were resuspended in 15 ml of 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% glycerol, 1.0% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and homogenized with a Bead Beater (Biospec Products) with 50 g glass beads. The homogenate was centrifuged for 20 min at 5,000 ×g, and the supernatants were centrifuged for 20 min at 15,000 × g. Then the supernatants were recovered and were centrifuged for 1 h at 105,000 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of 5 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and extracted for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged for 60 min at 105,000 × g. The pellet (fraction P) and supernatant (fraction S) were kept at −90 °C and were both assayed for protein contents and mannosyltransferase activity. The assay mixture containing fraction P (300 μg of protein), 5 mmpyridylamino-oligosaccharide, 20 mm GDP-mannose donor, 50 mm Tris/maleate, pH 6.0, 20 mmMnCl2, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in a total volume of 25 μl was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C (standard assay). The reaction was initiated by the addition of GDP-mannose and terminated by heating the mixture for 10 min at 100 °C. After removal of the denatured protein by centrifugation, each reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC as will be described below. The amount of product was estimated by its fluorescence intensity using pyridylaminomannose as a standard. An Amide-80 column was used for the normal phase HPLC. The flow solvent was a 35:65 mixture of 3% acetic acid/triethylamine, pH 7.3, and acetonitrile, and the flow rate was 1.0 ml/min at 40 °C. Detection of the pyridylamino-oligosaccharides was fluorospectrometrically conducted with excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 400 nm, respectively. For the NMR analysis, the enzyme reaction was carried out in a total volume of 500 μl containing 5–10 mg of oligosaccharide or mannan, fraction P (about 12 mg of protein), 20 mm GDP-mannose, 50 mm Tris/maleate, pH 6.0, 20 mmMnCl2, and 0.3% Triton X-100. After incubation for 24–48 h at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by boiling, and the denatured protein was removed by centrifugation. The enzyme-modified oligosaccharide was fractionated by HPLC and lyophilized. The enzyme-modified mannan was dialyzed against water and lyophilized. All NMR experiments were performed using a JEOL JNM-GSX 400 spectrometer at 400 MHz for 1H in D2O at a probe temperature of 45 °C. Acetone (2.217 ppm) was used as the internal standard for the 1H NMR. The protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal.

The total amounts of protein in the membrane preparations, fractions P and S, prepared from the C. guilliermondii IFO 10279 strain cells were 48 and 38.5 mg, respectively. Transferase activities of the two fractions were assayed by incubation with GDP-mannose and pyridylamino-SaMan5. Although the two reaction systems gave the same single product corresponding to pyridylaminomannohexaose by HPLC, the total activity observed in fraction P (2597 nmol·h−1) was about three times higher than that in fraction S (923 nmol·h−1). Therefore, we used fraction P as the enzyme preparation for further studies. To determine the structure of the enzyme reaction product by NMR, a large scale reaction mixture with free SaMan5 was incubated for 36 h. The HPLC profile of the reaction products indicated that approximately 50% of the SaMan5 was transformed into a hexaose. The linkage sequence of the mannohexaose obtained by the enzyme reaction, abbreviated as SagMan6, was analyzed by a sequential NMR assignment method using rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY). This nonempirical assignment method has been demonstrated to give satisfactory results (8Shibata N. Hisamichi K. Kikuchi T. Kobayashi H. Okawa Y. Suzuki S.

Therefore, we started the sequential assignment of SagMan6 from the reducing terminal mannose unit. The boxed regions in Fig. 2indicate intraresidue H-1-H-2 or H-1-H-3 connectivities, which were confirmed by relayed coherence transfer spectroscopy (relayed COSY) and two-dimensional homonuclear Hartmann-Hahn spectroscopy (HOHAHA). On the other hand, cross-peaks labeled with primed letters indicate interresidue H-1-H-2′ or H-1-H-3′ connectivities between two adjacent mannose units. The numbers on the labels indicate the corresponding ring protons. Fig. 2, B and C, shows partial two-dimensional HOHAHA and ROESY spectra, respectively, of SagMan6. Since the H-1-H-2-correlated cross-peak A2 indicates the H-2 chemical shift of Man-A, the NOE cross-peak A2′ between the H-2 of Man-A and the H-1 of Man-B was easily assigned. Similarly, the NOE cross-peak B2′ between the H-2 of Man-B, which was assigned from cross-peak B2, and the H-1 of Man-C was assigned. Since Man-C is substituted by an α-1,3 linkage, the NOE cross-peak C3′ was found through the H-1-H-3-correlated cross-peak C3. Usually, an α-1,3 linkage gives weak H-1-H-2′ NOE cross-peak in addition to strong H-1-H-3′ NOE cross-peak. Therefore, we can also assign through the H-1-H-2-correlated cross-peak C2 and the NOE cross-peak C2′ between the H-2 of Man-D and the H-1 of Man-C. Additionally, we could find the NOE cross-peak D2′ between the H-2 of Man-D and the H-1 of Man-E, of which the signal, 4.764 ppm, corresponds to the β-1,2-linked mannose unit (10Shibata N.

Using this procedure, we could sequentially assign the H-1 signal from Man-A to Man-E as A2-A2′-B2-B2′-C3-C3′-(or -C2-C2′-)-D2-D2′-E2. Therefore, we assumed that Man-D of SagMan6 is substituted by a β-1,2-linked mannose unit, Man-E. It has been shown that the H-1 signal of an α-linked mannose unit substituted by a single β-1,2-linked unit causes a downfield shift (Δδ = 0.09–0.12 ppm) (10Shibata N. Fukasawa S. Kobayashi H.

In the spectrum of SagMan6, the H-1 proton of Man-D at 5.239 ppm appeared at 0.1 ppm more downfield than that of SaMan5 at 5.129 ppm, and there is a β-mannose specific H-1-H-5-correlated cross-peak. Moreover, SagMan6 resisted digestion with a jack bean α-mannosidase. These data also supported the fact that Man-D of SagMan6 is substituted by the β-1,2-linked mannose unit. Therefore, we determined the structure of SagMan6 to be the following. Manβ1→2Manα1→3Manα1→2Manα1→2Man ↑6 Manα1 STRUCTURE1The same hexaose has been found in O-linked oligosaccharides (16Zhang W.

Since these findings indicate that the assay system is able to detect the β-1,2-mannosyltransferase IV, we further examined some properties of this enzyme. The effect of buffer pH on the transferase activity was studied over the pH range of 3.5–8.5. The β-1,2-mannosyltransferase IV exhibits maximum activity at about pH 6.0 in 50 mm Tris/maleate (Fig. 3). The effect of several divalent cations, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+, on the enzyme activity was studied using their respective chlorides. As shown in Table I, the enzyme activity was enhanced by the addition of Mn2+, Mg2+, or Ca2+. The enzyme activity was not affected by the addition of EDTA. Furthermore, the enzyme activity was completely inhibited by the addition of 20 mmZnCl2, and the lost activity could not be recovered by the addition of EDTA.Table IEffect of divalent metal ions and EDTA on the β-1,2-mannosyltransferase activity in fraction PMetal salt (20 mm)Mannose incorporatednmol · mg protein −1 · h −1None17MnCl253MgCl245ZnCl20CaCl240NiCl219EDTA15ZnCl2, EDTA1-aAfter 3-h incubation at 30°C with 20 mmZnCl2, the same amount of 40 mm EDTA was added.0The reaction conditions were the same as those given under “Experimental Procedures” except that the additional divalent metal ion to the reaction mixture was varied as indicated.1-a After 3-h incubation at 30°C with 20 mmZnCl2, the same amount of 40 mm EDTA was added.

The enzyme activity is linear for at least 1.5 h at 30 °C under the standard conditions. The Lineweaver-Burk plot of the β-1,2-mannosyltransferase IV for pyridylamino-SaMan5 is shown in Fig. 4. TheK m and the V max values for pyridylamino-SaMan5 calculated from this figure were about 18 mm and 200 nmol·mg protein−1·h−1, respectively. To assess the substrate specificity of β-1,2-mannosyltransferase IV, we used the pyridylamino derivatives of the oligosaccharides prepared from the mannans of C. albicans, C. krusei, and S. cerevisiae and of enzymatically synthesized oligosaccharides as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Table II shows that the oligosaccharides containing an α-1,3-linked mannose unit at the nonreducing terminal can serve as acceptors. Although KaMan4, AaMan6, and SaMan6 can also possibly act as the acceptors of both the β-1,2-mannosyltransferase IV and an α-1,2-mannosyltransferase judging from the structure of C. guilliermondii mannan, their enzyme reaction products, designated as KagMan5, AagMan7, and SagMan7, exhibited a signal at about 4.76 ppm in the 1H NMR spectra (data not shown). Therefore, it is apparent that the transferred mannose unit is attached to each substrate with a β-1,2 linkage (10Shibata N. Fukasawa S. Kobayashi H. Tojo M. Yonezu T. Ambo A. Ohkubo Y. Suzuki S.

Since these β-1,2 linkage-containing branched oligosaccharides have not been found in the acetolysate of yeast mannans, it is reasonable to say that we could prepare novel oligosaccharides using the β-1,2-mannosyltransferase IV of C. guilliermondii. These results indicate that the β-1,2-mannosyltransferase IV requires the nonreducing terminal α-1,3-linked mannose unit as the substrate.Table IISubstrate specificity of the β-1,2-mannosyltransferasesSubstrate (5 mm)Mannose incorporated2-aThe β-1,2-mannosyltransferase and α-1,6-mannosyltransferase activities were calculated from the amount of the jack bean α-mannosidase-resistant and susceptible enzyme reaction products, respectively.AbbreviationStructureβ-1,2-Mannosyltransferaseα-1,6-Mannosyltransferasenmol · mg protein −1 · h −1Pyridylamino-KMan3Manα1→3Manα1→2Man-pyridylamine13149Pyridylamino-AMan4Manα1→2Manα1→2Manα1→2Man-pyridylamine00Pyridylamino-SMan4Manα1→3Manα1→2Manα1→2Man-pyridylamine141Pyridylamino-KaMan4Manα1→3Manα1→2Man-pyridylamine52↑6 Manα1 Pyridylamino-AMan5Manα1→3Manα1→2Manα1→2Manα1→2Man-pyridylamine149Pyridylamino-SMan5Manα1→3Manα1→3Manα1→2Manα1→2Man-pyridylamine697Pyridylamino-SaMan5Manα1→3Manα1→2Manα1→2Man-pyridylamine52↑ 6 Manα1 Pyridylamino-AaMan6Manα1→3Manα1→2Manα1→2Manα1→2Man-pyridylamine60↑ 6 Manα1 Pyridylamino-SaMan6Manα1→3Manα1→3Manα1→2Manα1→2Man-pyridylamine48↑ 6 Manα1 The reaction conditions were the same as those given under “Experimental Procedures” except that the substrate was varied as indicated.2-a The β-1,2-mannosyltransferase and α-1,6-mannosyltransferase activities were calculated from the amount of the jack bean α-mannosidase-resistant and susceptible enzyme reaction products, respectively.

The absence of lumenal chaperones was associated with a decrease in translocation efficiency and pronounced aggregation of the translation products. These studies suggest that chaperone-nascent chain interactions significantly enhance translocation and indicate that in the absence of such interactions, aggregation can serve as the predominant in vitro protein folding end point.

Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In alternative models, vectorial transport may also be driven through interaction of the nascent chain with lumenal molecular chaperones (3Neupert W. Hartl F.-U. Craig E.A. Pfanner N.

In the latter model, interactions between the nascent chain and lumenal molecular chaperones are thought to prevent retrograde transport through the translocation pore and thus bias movement of the nascent chain into the lumenal compartment (3Neupert W.

Biol. 1996; 7: 497-503Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Recent reconstitution experiments have identified the minimum subset of ER proteins necessary for in vitro protein translocation in the mammalian ER (13Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 14Oliver J. Jungnickel B. Görlich D. Rapoport T. High S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the minimal system, the translocation machinery is comprised of the signal recognition particle receptor which functions in the targeting of ribosome/nascent chain complexes to the ER, the Sec61p complex, which is thought to serve as a ribosome receptor and translocation channel, and, in some instances, the integral membrane protein TRAM, which participates in signal sequence recognition (13Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1993; 75: 615-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 14Oliver J. Jungnickel B. Görlich D. Rapoport T. High S.

The identification of the Sec61p complex as the primary ribosome receptor and translocation channel suggests that ribosome association with Sec61p could provide the aqueous pathway for nascent chain transit into the lumen (15Kalies K.U.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1101-1115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). It is clear from molecular genetic and biochemical studies that hsp70 proteins perform an essential function in protein translocation across the yeast ER and the mitochondrial inner membrane (17Vogel J.P. Misra L.M. Rose M.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1885-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 18Nguyen T.H. Law D.T. Williams D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1995; 81: 1085-1093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). From these studies, it has been proposed that hsp70 proteins promote unidirectional transport by binding to the nascent chain as it emerges into the lumen (matrix). It has not yet been established whether the interaction of the hsp70 proteins with the nascent chain drives vectorial transport by a thermal ratchet mechanism (3Neupert W. Hartl F.-U. Craig E.A. Pfanner N. Cell. 1990; 63: 447-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 4Simon S.M. Peskin C.S. Oster G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), or, alternatively, by a conformationally driven, motor process (23Horst M. Oppliger W. Feifel B. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 759-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Glick B.S. Cell. 1995; 80: 11-14Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is disagreement as to whether the role of hsp70 proteins is limited to translocation events that occur post-translationally (20Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), or alternatively, whether hsp70 proteins are required for co- and post-translational translocation (25Brodsky J.L. Goeckler J. Schekman R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9643-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that BiP is necessary for the complete translocation of prepro-α-factor, a precursor known to translocate post-translationally (26Lyman S.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the absence of BiP function, pro-α-factor is unable to fully transit to the ER lumen (26Lyman S.K. Schekman R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This defect, referred to as stalling, is quite similar to a translocation defect observed in mammalian microsomes that have been depleted of their lumenal contents (5Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In mammalian microsomes, the loss of lumenal proteins causes a disruption of the translocation reaction at a point subsequent to signal sequence cleavage, and results in the accumulation of the signal-cleaved nascent chains that are unable to efficiently transit to the vesicle lumen (5Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The analysis of the energetics of protein translocation is made difficult by the fact that protein translation, translocation, and folding are coincident processes and furthermore, that protein folding occurs in an environment, the ER lumen, which is highly enriched in molecular chaperones and protein folding enzymes. To study the contribution of protein folding and lumenal chaperone-nascent chain interactions to translocation, the translocation behavior of wild type and mutant forms of preprolactin (pPL) were analyzed in vivoand in vitro. The mutant preprolactin used in this study contains an 18-amino acid substitution at the NH2 terminus of the mature protein, eliminating a small disulfide-bonded loop domain (27Nicoll C.S. Mayer G.L. Russell S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 169-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 28Doneen B.A. Bewley T.A. Li C.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4851-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Whereas wild type (WT) prolactin was efficiently secretedin vivo, the folding mutant (FA) accumulated in the ER as large protein-protein and disulfide-bonded aggregates. In vitro, both WT and FA forms of prolactin were translocated with similar efficiencies but were recovered as mixed aggregates. Furthermore, aggregation was apparent co-translationally. In the absence of lumenal chaperones, aggregate formation was markedly enhanced and was accompanied by a reduction in translocation efficiency. On the basis of these data, we propose that lumenal protein-nascent chain interactions are paramount to efficient translocation and in their absence, irreversible protein-protein aggregation may serve as the predominant protein folding end point. COS-7 cells (29Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfections were performed by the DEAE-dextran method, as described in Ref. 30Gaut J.R. Hendershot L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7248-7255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Clone pPC-BP1 was constructed by excision of a full-length bovine preprolactin cDNA from the plasmid pGEMBP1 (31Connolly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2253-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with HindIII and EcoRI, and subcloning of the HindIII/EcoRI fragment intoHindIII/EcoRI-digested mammalian expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA). Mutant clone pPL-FA was constructed by 5′ add-on/recombinant PCR (32Higuchi R. PCR Techniques. Stockton Press, NY1989: 61-70Google Scholar) using pGEMBP1 as template. In the mutant clone FA, the first 18 amino acids of mature prolactin are: YHCDGFQNEQIYTDLEMN, whereas in wild type prolactin, the sequence is: TPVCPNGPGNCQVSLNDL. In wild type prolactin, a disulfide bond is formed between amino acids 4 and 11 (28Doneen B.A. Bewley T.A. Li C.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4851-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the mutant the entire disulfide-bonded loop domain has been exchanged with a random sequence. In the first series of PCR reactions, two products were synthesized using the following oligonucleotides: product 1, sense, 5′-TGGCAGACTCTAGAGCATGGACAG-3′ and antisense, 5′-ATAAATTTGCTCGTTCTGAAACCATCACAATGATAGGAGACCACACCCTG-3′ product 2, sense, 5′-AACGAGCAAATTTATACTGATTTGGAGATGAACTTTGACCGGGCAGTC-3′ and antisense, 5′-GCCGAATTCTTAGCGTTGTTGTT-3′. Products 1 and 2 were gel purified and used as template cDNA in a second PCR reaction with oligonucleotides product 1, sense, and product 2, antisense. PCR was performed as described above and the product, representing full-length pPL-FA cDNA, gel purified. Full-length pPL-FA cDNA was digested with HindIII/BamHI and subcloned into the vector pCDNA3 for transient transfection experiments. Positive clones, identified by antibiotic selection and restriction mapping, were subjected to dideoxy sequencing prior to transfection studies, to ensure the accuracy of the mutations. Pulse-chase studies were performed 40–48 h post-transfection as described in Ref. 33Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar. Monolayer cultures in 60-mm dishes were washed twice in methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and the respective cellular amino acid pools depleted by incubation in methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 20 min at 37 °C. The labeling reaction was subsequently performed by addition of 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (Pro-Mix; Amersham) in 300 μl of methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15 min at 37 °C. Following the labeling period, isotope-supplemented media was removed, and cells washed in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2 mmmethionine, 0.5 mm cysteine, 1% fetal calf serum (chase media). At the indicated time points, the chase media (0.5 ml) was removed and the cells harvested by scraping into ice-cold PBS. Cells were washed 2 times in PBS and lysed by addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris/Cl (pH 7.4), 300 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 mm EDTA). After a brief sonication, samples were supplemented with bovine serum albumin, to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml, and centrifuged to remove particulate material. Lysates were pre-cleared by addition of either 40 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A-Sepharose or the equivalent volume of Pansorbin (Calbiochem) and indirect immunoprecipitations performed by addition of rabbit anti-sheep prolactin (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) (1:250 dilution) and overnight incubation at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected by addition of 40 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein A-Sepharose and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Protein A-Sepharose resin was collected by centrifugation (2 min, 2,000 ×g), extensively washed with lysis buffer, and resuspended in PBS. Radiolabeled prolactin was eluted by addition of 40 μl of 0.5m Tris, 5% SDS, 0.1 m DTT and heating for 20 min at 65 °C and 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels or Tris-Tricine gels as described previously (34Nicchitta C.V. Murphy E.C. Haynes R. Shelness G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In experiments in which disulfide bond formation was studied, monolayers were washed in ice-cold PBS, and prior to lysis, free sulfhydryls alkylated by addition of 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) for 20 min on ice, as described in Ref. 35Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar. Microsomal membranes from transfected COS-7 cells were prepared as follows: 40 h post-transfection, cells from two 100-mm culture dishes were pulse labeled as described above, the labeling media removed, and the cells recovered by scraping into ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin). The cells were washed 1 time in lysis buffer, resuspended to 1 ml, incubated on ice for 15 min, and homogenized (20 strokes) with a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was adjusted to 250 mm sucrose and centrifuged for 10 min at 700 × g (4 °C). The supernatant from this step was removed and the centrifugation step repeated. The final supernatant was centrifuged for 15 min at 70,000 rpm in the Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. The resulting pellet fraction, representing the post-nuclear membranes, was resuspended in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm K-HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, to a final volume of 0.5 ml. Protease digestions were performed on ice for 30 min with 50 μg/ml proteinase K. Where indicated, Triton X-100 was present at 0.5%. Protease digestions were quenched by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 3 mm and after a 15-min incubation on ice, the membranes were solubilized with lysis buffer, and radiolabeled prolactin translation products isolated by immunoprecipitation. Pulse-chase studies were performed as described above and incubations quenched by addition of ice-cold PBS supplemented with 20 mm NEM. Cell lysates were prepared as described (35Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A. Nature. 1992; 356: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and cleared of large aggregates by centrifugation for 15 min at 15,000 × g (4 °C). Lysates were overlaid onto 8–35% sucrose gradients prepared in lysis buffer supplemented with 0.2% Triton X-100. Gradients were prepared and harvested with a Buchler Auto-Densi Flow apparatus (Buchler Instruments, Lexana, KY). Gradients were centrifuged for 16 h at 39,000 × rpm in the Beckman SW-40 rotor (4 °C). 850-μl fractions were collected, and indirect prolactin immunoprecipitations performed as described above.

All translations were performed using reticulocyte lysate, prepared as in Ref. 37Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Meth.

The preprolactins are members of a family of hormones that include the growth hormones and placental lactogens (27Nicoll C.S. Mayer G.L. Russell S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 169-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 28Doneen B.A. Bewley T.A. Li C.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4851-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These proteins share extensive amino acid sequence homology and are thought to display a conserved, general, three-dimensional structure (27Nicoll C.S. Mayer G.L. Russell S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 169-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 40Abdel-Meguid S.S. Shieh H.-S. Smith W.W. Dayringer H.E. Violand B.N. Bentle L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6434-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The mammalian prolactins can be readily distinguished from the growth hormones by a small, disulfide-bonded loop (amino acid residues 4–11) present at the amino terminus (27Nicoll C.S. Mayer G.L. Russell S.M. Endocr. Rev. 1986; 7: 169-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 28Doneen B.A. Bewley T.A. Li C.H. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4851-4860Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The disulfide-bonded loop immediately precedes one of the four α-helical segments characteristic of this family of hormones and is diagramatically illustrated in Fig. 1. By PCR mutagenesis, the sequence encompassing this disulfide-bonded domain was exchanged with a random amino acid sequence, lacking the residues 4–11 disulfide bond pair, to yield a mutant referred to as pPL-FA (Fig. 1).Figure 2Kinetics of secretion: wild type and mutant prolactin. Forty hours post-transfection, COS-7 cells were pulse labeled with [35S]methionine (200 μCi/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. Subsequently, the labeling media was exchanged with isotope-free media, supplemented with 2 mml-methionine, and at the indicated time points the media was removed and the cells lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer. Radiolabeled prolactin was recovered from the media and lysed cell extracts by indirect immunoprecipitation, as described under “Materials and Methods.” The immunoprecipitates were reduced, separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% gels, and analyzed by PhosphorImaging.

Kuehl W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 8869-8876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the prolactin mutant FA, the NH2-terminal domain lacks the cysteine pair present in the wild type protein, and therefore a protein folding event which likely occurs very early in translocation, perhaps immediately upon access of the nascent chain to the ER lumen, cannot occur. It was postulated that mutations within this discrete structural domain would significantly disrupt the protein folding pathway of prolactin, and thereby prove useful in investigations on the contributions of protein folding and lumenal protein interactions to protein translocation. Exit of secretory proteins from the ER occurs coincident with structural maturation and is the underlying basis for the variations in the rate of secretion observed between proteins in a given cell (42Pelham H.R.B. Ann. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 43Lodish H.F. Kong N. Snider M. Strous G.J.A.M.

Bole D. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To assay for disruptions in the folding behavior of pPL-FA, pulse-chase studies were performed in transfected COS-7 cells expressing either pPL-WT or pPL-FA. The results of these studies are depicted in Fig.2. Under the described conditions, prolactin-WT is rapidly secreted with a half-time of 25 min (n = 4) (Fig. 2 A, WT). Prolactin-FA, in contrast, remained predominately cell associated throughout the 90-min chase time (Fig.2 A, FA), indicating that prolactin-FA displays a significant defect in protein folding. Proteolytic degradation via a non-lysosomal protein degradation pathway is a common fate of transport-incompetent proteins (46Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 47Lord J.M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1067-1069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To assess the stability of the secretion incompetent prolactin-FA, extended pulse-chase studies were performed. In these experiments, it was observed that at chase periods of up to 8 h, the vast majority of the prolactin-FA was neither secreted nor degraded (Fig. 2 B, compare WT versus FA). These results suggest that prolactin-FA is either not a substrate for the relevant proteases or, alternatively, has not gained access to the degradation compartment. Recent studies on ER-associated protein degradation have provided evidence of a novel pathway which functions to transport malfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol, for subsequent degradation by the proteasome complex (48Werner E.D.

Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). To determine if prolactin-FA was retained within a membrane compartment, presumably the ER, nascent chains were pulse-labeled and a microsomal fraction prepared from the labeled cells. The protease accessibility of prolactin-FA and prolactin-WT in the microsomal fraction was then ascertained by digestion with exogenous proteases. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 3. Both WT and FA forms of prolactin were equivalently protected from digestion with exogenous proteases in the absence (lanes 2and 5) but not the presence (lanes 3 and6) of detergent. The absolute degree of protease protection varied from 40 to 70% between experiments although in all cases the relative degree of protease protection of prolactin-WT and prolactin-FA was nearly identical. 2R.

These data, in combination with those presented in Fig. 2, indicate that the described mutation in the NH2-terminal disulfide-bonded loop domain yields a form of prolactin that is efficiently translocated yet remains in a structural state that is unsuitable for transport through the secretory pathway or retrograde transport to the cytosol. It has been reported that nascent chains may form protein-protein, as well as disulfide-bonded aggregates, dur"
https://openalex.org/W2084448656,"Multiple functional domains responsible for calmodulin (CaM) binding and actin-binding/actomyosin ATPase inhibition are present in the region between residues 598–756 of the chicken gizzard smooth muscle caldesmon (CaD) molecule. To precisely localize these functional domains and to further elucidate the structural basis of these domains, we analyzed a series of purified mutants of chicken gizzard smooth muscle CaD generated by internal deletions of amino acid sequences and expression in a baculovirus expression system. Our results demonstrate that, in addition to a strong actin-binding site sequence between residues 718–723 (Wang, Z., and Chacko, S. (1996)J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25707–25714), two weak actin-binding motifs are present in the regions between residues 690–699 and 650–666. These weak actin-binding regions function independently and are associated with weak actomyosin inhibitory activity. Analysis of the CaM-binding sites A (residues 658–666) and B (residues 690–695), the major CaM-binding sites in the C-terminal region of CaD, provided direct evidence for the involvement of both CaM-binding sites in the CaM-mediated reversal of the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD and for the functional independence of the two CaM-binding sites. Furthermore, the sequences between residues 598–649, upstream of CaM-binding site A, and 700–717, downstream of CaM-binding site B, appear to have no effect on either actin-binding or CaM-binding. The data also suggest that both CaM-binding sites A and B structurally overlap or lie in close proximity to the adjacent weak actin-binding sites and weak actomyosin ATPase inhibitory determinants.

It has been established that CaD inhibits the actin-activated ATPase activity of phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin (for review, see Refs. 12Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem.

This CaD-induced inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity is completely released by Ca2+-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) or caltropin (18Mani R.S. Kay C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6658-6663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) in the presence of Ca2+.

Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that the inhibitory function of CaD is modulated by phosphorylation of the CaD C-terminal region by mitogen-activated protein kinase or cdc2 kinase, leading to partial reversal of the CaD-induced inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity (19Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. Gusev N.B. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 20Childs T.J. Watson M.H. Sanghera J.S. Campbell D.L. Pelech S.L. Mak A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22853-22859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The exact inhibitory mechanism by which CaD inhibits actomyosin ATPase activity is unclear, but proposed models include competition of CaD with myosin for the same binding site in the actin molecule (21Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1878-1885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and CaD-mediated effect on the catalytic step in the ATPase cycle (22Horiuchi K.Y. Samuel M. Chacko S.

Functional analysis of CaD fragments produced from limited proteolysis, chemical cleavage, and bacterial expression systems has led to the localization of various functional domains in the CaD molecule. The major myosin-binding site was mapped to the NH2-terminal region of CaD (21Hemric M.E. Chalovich J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1878-1885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ikebe M.

Chem. 1991; 266: 9166-9172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recently restricted to a smaller region between residues 658–756 (29Bartegi A. Fattoum A. Derancourt J. Kassab R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15231-15238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,30Redwood C.S. Marston S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10969-10976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, our analysis of C-terminal deletion mutants of chicken gizzard CaD derived in our laboratory indicated the presence of multiple actin-binding sites and ATPase inhibitory determinants in the region between residues 658–756 (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Further analysis of internal deletion mutants of chicken gizzard CaD identified a strong actin-binding motif of six amino acid residues from Lys718to Glu723, which also forms the core sequence for CaD-induced inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity (32Wang Z. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our findings also suggested that the region between residues 690 and 717 is associated with the weak inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity. This weak inhibitory determinant between residues 690–717 and the strong inhibitory determinant between residues 718–756 function independently (32Wang Z. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has been assumed that Ca2+-CaM is involved in the regulation of CaD function because Ca2+-CaM completely reverses the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD and, to some extent, displaces CaD bound to actin (4–9, and for review, see Refs. 12Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar and 13Sobue K. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12115-12118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of data from biochemical studies using synthetic and chymotryptic peptides of CaD has defined two major CaM-binding sites in the C terminus of CaD, which have been precisely localized to a sequence between residues 658–666 (CaM-binding site A) (33Zhan Q. Wong S.S. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21810-21814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and a sequence between residues 687–695 (CaM-binding site B) (34Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. Pritchard K. Gusev N.B. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of C-terminal truncated proteins of CaD further localized CaM-binding site B to a six-residue stretch from Asn690 to Lys695 (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of the two calmodulin-binding sites in the interaction with Ca2+-CaM remains controversial. To better understand the weak actin-binding and actomyosin ATPase inhibitory domains and the relationship between the CaM-binding sites and actin-binding/actomyosin ATPase inhibitory domains in the CaD molecule, we generated a series of internal deletion in the regions that encompass the weak actin-binding sites, and analyzed these mutants for their actin-binding, inhibition of actomyosin ATPase, and CaM binding. Our data clearly demonstrate that 1) two weak actin-binding/actomyosin ATPase inhibitory motifs are located in the regions between residues 650–666 and 690–699, respectively; that 2) both CaM-binding sites A and B are functionally involved in CaM-induced reversal of CaD-mediated inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity; and that 3) both CaM-binding sites A and B overlap or are in close proximity with the adjacent weak actin-binding/ATPase inhibitory determinants. Experiments were designed to produce CaD mutants that lack specific, targeted amino acid sequences while preserving the rest of the CaD structure. The full-length chicken gizzard smooth muscle CaD cDNA (a generous gift from Dr. Joseph Bryan) (35Bryan J. Imai M. Lee R. Moore P. Cook R.G. Lin W.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13873-13879Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the pBluescript SK+ plasmid, and sense single-stranded pBluescript CaD cDNA was made as a template for a site-directed mutagenesis reaction as described (32Wang Z. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The following antisense mutagenesis oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems DNA/RNA synthesizer: CaDΔ710–717, 5′-CCAGAGATTACGTTTATCAGAAGGTTTTGG-3′ CaDΔ700–717, 5′-CCAGAGATTACGTTTACCCTCTGGGGTCTT-3′ CaDΔ690–717, 5′-CCAGAGATTACGTTTGATACGACTGGAGAC-3′ CaDΔ690–699, 5′-AGCAGGCGATTTGTTGATACGACTGGAGAC-3′ CaDΔ629–639, 5′-GTCAGAGGCTGCTGGTGCACTAGTATATTG-3′ CaDΔ629–649, 5′-ATTACGGACACCCTCTGCACTAGTATATTG-3′ CaDΔ629–666, 5′-TGTTCCCCCAGGTGATGCACTAGTATATTG-3′ CaDΔ609–628, 5′-CTTGTTGCCCACAACGGCAGGTTTCATACC-3′. Internal deletion mutants of CaD were generated as described (32Wang Z. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and confirmed by sequencing the mutagenized regions. After subcloning into the Pvl941 vector for expression in Sf9 cells, each CaD mutant was checked for correct orientation, and sequences were reconfirmed by DNA sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Production of baculovirus recombinants by co-transfecting Sf9 cells with a mixture of recombinant baculovirus vector and wild-type Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) DNA and isolation of the recombinants were carried out as described (31Wang Z.

Chacko S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 646-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle actin, CaD, myosin, and tropomyosin were purified from chicken gizzard (38Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S.

Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2731-2736Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Calmodulin was isolated from bovine brain acetone powder (41Dedman J.R. Kaetzel M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 102: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The concentrations of full-length CaD and CaD mutants were determined by the method of Lowry (42Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the concentrations of other proteins were measured spectrophotometrically using the following extinction coefficients: actin, E 290 1% = 6.3; calmodulin, E 277 1% = 1.9; tropomyosin,E 277 1% = 1.9; and myosin,E 280 1% = 0.647. CaM-coupled agarose (Sigma) was used to determine the binding of full-length CaD or CaD mutants to CaM according to our published method (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was estimated by incubation of agarose (without coupled calmodulin) with increasing concentrations of 14C-labeled full-length CaD or CaD mutants, and these values were subtracted from each point on the binding curve. Binding of 14C-labeled CaD mutants to actin and tropomyosin-actin was determined by co-sedimentation using an Airfuge (Beckman Instruments) as described (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The amounts of bound and unbound CaD mutants were estimated using a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). The 14C-labeled full-length CaD and CaD mutants were also used to determine actin binding in the presence or absence of tropomyosin, as described (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All the binding assays were done in triplicate. The apparent dissociation constants for calmodulin, actin, and actin-tropomyosin bindings were determined by Scatchard analysis (43Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar) and by weighted nonlinear least-squares curve fitting as described by Munson and Rodbard (44Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar). ATPase assays were carried out at 25 °C as described (45Chacko S. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2105-2110Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific assay conditions are described in the figure legends. ATPase assays for each experimental parameter were repeated four times using four different protein preparations. Data from a representative experiment are shown in each figure. Our previous studies suggested that the region between residues 690–717 in the CaD molecule is associated with weak actin binding, weak inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity, and strong CaM binding (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Wang Z. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the exact location of the functional motifs in the sequence between residues 690–717 and its structural relationship with CaM-binding site B are unknown (36Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Jacob S.S. Gopalakurup S. Chacko S. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 646-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To further define the functional motifs, we constructed several internal deletion mutants of chicken gizzard smooth muscle CaD, which progressively lacked the targeted sequences within residues 690–717, and overexpressed them in a baculovirus system (36Wang Z.

The actin-binding of both CaDΔ700–717 and CaDΔ710–717, which lack 18 and 8 amino acids, respectively (see in Fig. 1), was similar to that of full-length CaD (Fig. 2 A). By contrast, binding of CaDΔ690–717 and CaDΔ690–699 to actin was slightly less (13% and 9%, respectively) than that of full-length CaD (Fig. 2 A). The actin-binding of both full-length CaD and CaD mutants was saturated at a CaD concentration of 5 μm(molar ratio of CaD to actin, 1:4). As expected, the presence of smooth muscle tropomyosin increased the binding of both full-length CaD and CaD mutants to actin (Fig. 2 B). Scatchard analysis of the binding affinity of both full-length CaD and the internal deletion mutants to actin or tropomyosin-actin (43Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar, 44Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7759) Google Scholar) showed that CaDΔ690–717 and CaDΔ690–699 bound to actin with lower affinity (0.65 ± 0.033 × 10−6m and 0.64 ± 0.037 × 10−6m, respectively) than did full-length CaD (0.5 ± 0.03 × 10−6m), whereas CaDΔ710–717 and CaDΔ700–717 bound to actin with an affinity (0.51 ± 0.03 × 10−6m and 0.51 ± 0.035 × 10−6m, respectively) similar to that of intact CaD. In the presence of smooth muscle tropomyosin, the apparentK d values of actin-binding for CaD1–756, CaDΔ710–717, CaDΔ700–717, CaDΔ690–717, and CaDΔ690–699 were 0.27 ± 0.01, 0.27 ± 0.013, 0.28 ± 0.011, 0.36 ± 0.02, and 0.35 ± 0.025 × 10−6m, respectively. Effects of full-length CaD and the internal deletion mutants on the inhibition of the activation of smooth muscle myosin ATPase activity by smooth muscle actin or tropomyosin-actin were measured (in Fig.3). CaDΔ710–717, which lacks residues Leu710 to Gly717, inhibited the actin or tropomyosin-actin activated ATPase hydrolysis of myosin as efficiently as did full-length CaD, whereas CaDΔ700–717, CaDΔ690–717, and CaDΔ690–699 were relatively less effective in this inhibition (Fig.3 A). Maximal inhibition obtained with CaDΔ690–699, CaDΔ700–717, and CaDΔ690–717 was reduced by approximately 15%, 17%, and 29%, respectively, as compared with that of full-length CaD. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the presence of smooth muscle tropomyosin enhanced the maximal inhibition caused by CaD1–756, CaDΔ690–699, CaDΔ710–717, CaDΔ700–717, and CaDΔ690–717. Previous studies using a 7.3-kDa CaD C-terminal peptide produced from limited proteolysis indicated that the region between residues 597–665 in the chicken gizzard smooth muscle CaD molecule is critical for both actin-binding and inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity (46Chalovich J.M. Bryan J. Benson C.E. Velaz L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16644-16650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies using truncated CaD mutants suggested that the region between residues 658–689 is only associated with weak actin-binding and weak inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity and that the region between residues 598–657 has no detectable activity for inhibition of actomyosin ATPase (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To provide more precise analysis of the weak actin-binding and inhibitory domains, we generated various CaD internal deletion mutants (Fig. 1), focusing on the region between residues 609–666. Deletion of the region between residues 609–628 did not alter the binding of CaD to actin, nor did removal of residues 629–639 (CaDΔ629–639) or residues 629–649 (CaDΔ629–649) (Fig.4uA). However, further deletion of a segment between residues 650–666 resulted in a 16% decrease in the binding to actin compared with the actin-binding produced by full-length CaD (Fig.4 A). Moreover, the binding of CaDΔ650–666 to actin was similar to that of CaDΔ629–666, and dual deletions of residues 650–666 and 690–699 (CaDΔ650–666/590–699) resulted in an additive effect on the decreased level of binding to actin (Fig.4 A). Apparently, the region between residues 650–666 contains a functional motif responsible for weak actin-binding. The apparent dissociation constants of CaDΔ609–628, CaDΔ629–639, and CaDΔ629–649 were identical to that of full-length CaD, whereas the apparent K d value for CaDΔ629–666 was 0.68 ± 0.037 × 10−6m, indicating a 36% increase over that of full-length CaD. The apparentK d value of the actin-binding of CaDΔ650–666/690–699 was 1.07 ± 0.07 × 10−6m. The presence of tropomyosin increased the binding of full-length CaD and the CaD mutants to actin (Fig.4 B). The apparent K d values of CaDΔ629–666 and CaDΔ650–666/690–699 for tropomyosin-actin binding were 0.4 ± 0.027 and 0.61 ± 0.053 × 10−6m, respectively. The apparentK d values of CaDΔ650–666 for both actin binding and tropomyosin-actin binding were indistinguishable from those of CaDΔ629–666. Analysis of the ability of the internal deletion mutants to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity revealed a similar degree of inhibition for both actin and tropomyosin-actin activated myosin ATPase activities with CaD1–756, CaDΔ609–628, CaDΔ629–639, and CaDΔ629–649, whereas deletion of residues 629–666 caused a 37 and 19% decrease in the inhibition of actin-activated and tropomyosin-actin-activated myosin ATPase activity, respectively, as compared with that of full-length CaD (Fig. 5,A and B). In the presence of CaDΔ650–666, the inhibition of actin-activated and tropomyosin-actin-activated myosin ATPase activities was similar to that of CaDΔ629–666 (Fig. 5,A and B). The CaD dual internal deletion mutant, CaDΔ650–666/690–699, caused a less inhibitory effect on both actin-activated and tropomyosin-actin-activated myosin ATPase activities compared with those generated by either CaDΔ629–666 or CaDΔ690–717. A CaD internal deletion mutant lacking residues 597–608 was also generated using the baculovirus expression system; this mutant showed the same actin binding and inhibitory function as full-length CaD (data not shown). Thus, the weak inhibitory determinant is present in the amino acid stretch from Glu650 to Ser666. As shown in Fig. 6, A andB, deletion of the regions between residues 690–699 and between residues 650–666 led to a 40 and 24% decrease, respectively, in binding to CaM as compared with that of full-length CaD. CaDΔ650–666/690–699 lacking residues 650–666 and 690–699 was unable to bind to CaM (Fig. 6 B). The CaM-binding capacity of CaDΔ650–666 was similar to that of CaDΔ629–666 (data not shown). The sequences between residues 700–717 and residues 609–649 were not responsible for the binding of CaD to CaM because CaDΔ609–628, CaDΔ629–639, CaDΔ629–649, CaDΔ710–717, and CaDΔ700–717 bound to CaM as tightly as full-length CaD. Moreover, deletion of the sequence between residues 680–689 did not affect the binding of CaD to CaM (data not shown). Scatchard analysis showed that the CaDΔ710–717, CaDΔ700–717, CaDΔ609–628, CaDΔ629–639, and 629–649 bound to CaM with the same affinity as full-length CaD (0.98 ± 0.061 × 10−6m). In contrast, the affinity of both CaDΔ690–699 and CaDΔ690–717 to CaM (2.01 ± 0.063 and 1.96 ± 0.058 × 10−6m, respectively) was reduced ∼2-fold compared with that generated by full-length CaD. As expected, CaDΔ629–666 displayed a markedly reduced affinity for CaM (1.45 ± 0.048 × 10−6m). The apparent K d value of the CaM-binding of CaDΔ650–666 was indistinguishable from that of CaDΔ629–666. Analysis to determine whether both CaM-binding sites A and B were functionally involved in CaM-induced reversal of CaD-mediated inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity showed that inhibition by both CaDΔ629–666 and CaDΔ690–717 was reduced with increasing concentrations of Ca2+-CaM (Fig. 7). At 1:1 molar ratios of CaM to actin or tropomyosin-actin, the percentage of reversal by CaM for the inhibition caused by CaDΔ629–666 was slightly lower than that of both full-length CaD and CaDΔ690–717. At a stoichiometry of 0.075 mol CaD/mol CaM, the inhibition induced by both CaDΔ629–666 and CaDΔ690–717 was completely reversed, similar to that for full-length CaD (Fig. 7). Ca2+-CaM also reversed the inhibition by CaDΔ629–666 in a pattern similar to that of CaDΔ690–717. Additionally, tropomyosin did not affect the CaM-induced reversal of the inhibition by either full-length CaD or the internal deletion mutants consistent with our recent findings (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Wang Z. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Together, the results indicate that both CaM-binding sites A and B are functionally involved in the CaM-reversal for inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD and both function independently. Based on our previous studies (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 32Wang Z. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we postulated the presence of a weak actin-binding motif in the region between residues 690–717. The present study supports this suggestion and further defines the weak actin-binding motif to a 10-residue sequence from Asn690 to Gly699. The sequence between residues 700–717 does not contribute to actin binding since removal of this region had very little effect on the binding of CaD to actin (Fig. 2). We therefore conclude that the 67-amino acid region between residues 690–756 in the C terminus of CaD contains two discontinuous actin-binding motifs,i.e. the strong actin-binding motif consisting of six residues from Lys718 to Glu723 (32Wang Z. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and the weak actin-binding motif located between residues 690–699. The two functional motifs are separated by an 18-residue stretch from Asn700 to Gly717 (Fig. 2). The presence of tropomyosin did not modify these binding sites except for the increased amounts of CaD bound per actin (Fig. 2 B). The 10-residue sequence from Asn690 to Gly699 was also associated with very weak inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the region between residues 700–709, which is not required for actin-binding, appears to be necessary for the weak inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity because deletion of residues 710–717 (CaDΔ710–717) had no effect on the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD, and further deletion of the stretch from Asn700 to Asp709 (CaDΔ700–717) slightly lowered the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD (Fig. 3). Again, tropomyosin enhanced this effect (Fig. 3 B). These results strongly suggest that the weak inhibitory determinant is located in the 20-residue stretch from Asn690 to Asp709. Our previous analysis of CaD C-terminal truncated mutants (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) showed that the region between residues 598–657, responsible for weak actin-binding, has no detectable activity on inhibition of actomyosin ATPase, whereas residues 658–689 are needed for both weak actin-binding and weak inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Experiments using CaD C-terminal internal deletion mutants in the region between residues 629–666 (Fig. 1) showed that deletion of the region between residues 629–649 has no effect on the actin/tropomyosin-actin binding and CaD-induced inhibition of actin-activation of myosin ATPase. However, further deletion of the sequence between residues 650–666 affected both the actin/tropomyosin-actin binding and CaD-induced inhibition of actin-activation of myosin ATPase (Figs. 4 and 5). It may be argued that the effect of deletion of residues 629–666 on actin-binding and on the CaD-induced inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity is due to an abnormal conformational change rather than deletion of a functional motif present in the region (residues 629–666). Deletion of residues 609–628 and 629–649 had no effect on both actin binding and the CaD-induced inhibition, whereas deletion of a 17-amino acid stretch (residues 650–666) resulted in a decrease in both actin-binding and inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity similar to those of CaDΔ629–666. These data strongly suggest the presence of a functional motif in residues 650–666 in the CaD molecule. Together with our previous results (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the present data further define the functional domain to the segment from Met658 to Ser666. Moreover, the region between residues 629–649 (Figs. 4 and 5), upstream of the segment from Glu650 to Ser666, is not involved in either actin-binding or inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity since the actin-binding and inhibitory activities of CaD were unchanged with deletion up to 21 residues from Val629 to Ala649. The data from the present study also suggested that the actin-binding motifs present in residues 650–666 and 690–699 function independently since deletion of either residues 650–666 or 690–699 reduced the binding of CaD to actin. Furthermore, the CaD dual internal deletion mutant, CaDΔ650–666/690–699, had a lower binding capacity to actin when compared with those generated by either CaDΔ650–666 or CaDΔ690–699 (Fig. 4). While the major CaM-binding sites in CaD molecule are well established, there is controversy about the functional significance of CaM-binding sites A and B in CaM-induced reversal for inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD (34Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. Pritchard K. Gusev N.B. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Zhuang S. Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 19964-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The data from Marston et al. (34Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. Pritchard K. Gusev N.B. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) favor CaM-binding site B, but not CaM-binding site A, as the function-associated CaM-binding site because a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence Ser657-Gly670 did not release the CaM-induced reversal of the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD. By contrast, Zhuang et al. (47Zhuang S. Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 19964-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), using a similar research approach, concluded that CaM-binding site A, but not CaM-binding site B, is involved in the CaM-CaD interaction for reversal of the CaD-induced inhibition. One reason for this discrepancy may be the lack of amino acids adjacent to CaM binding sites A or B needed for the protein conformation required for the protein-protein interaction in these studies. To clarify this issue, we analyzed the CaD internal deletion mutants in which CaM-binding sites A and B were nest-deleted, respectively, for their inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity in the presence of Ca2+-CaM. Our data clearly show that both CaM-binding sites A and B are involved in the CaM-induced reversal of the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD (Fig.7) and behave as independent functional domains despite the fact that the affinity of CaM-binding site B to CaM is approximately 1.3-fold higher than that of CaM-binding site A (Fig. 6). However, when inhibition was induced by the deletion mutant lacking CaM-binding site A (the region between residues 650–666), the release of the inhibition by CaM was lower than the CaM-induced release of the inhibition caused by the deletion mutants lacking the CaM-binding site B (the region between residues 690–699), indicating that CaM-binding site A is functionally more active than CaM-binding site B. The discrepancies between our observations and those of others most likely rests in the use of synthetic CaD peptides, including VG29C (47Zhuang S. Wang E. Wang C.-L.A. J. Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 19964-19968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and M73 (34Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. Pritchard K. Gusev N.B. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that lack the necessary conformation for functional and structural interaction with CaM. Our present data also indicate that CaM-binding sites A and B each structurally overlap or lie in close proximity to the adjacent weak actin-binding motifs and weak inhibitory domains. The structural features of both CaM-binding sites A and B support the assumption that CaM competes with actin for binding to the same common contact sites in the CaD molecule. Note that the NMR measurements of bacterially generated human CaD fragments by Marstonet al. (34Marston S.B. Fraser I.D.C. Huber P.A.J. Pritchard K. Gusev N.B. Torok K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested the presence of a CaM-binding motif in a region corresponding to the sequence between residues 717–725 in the chicken gizzard smooth muscle CaD molecule. However, our previous results show that the deletion of the sequence between residues 718–756 has no effect on the binding of CaD to CaM (31Wang Z. Horiuchi K.Y. Chacko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2234-2242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, a CaD internal deletion mutant lacking the region between residues 717–725 bound to CaM with the same affinity as did full-length CaD (data not shown). These results directly rule out the possibility that a CaM-binding site is present in the region between residues 717–725. Thus, it is unlikely that CaM-induced reversal of inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD is caused in part through interaction of residues 717–725 in the CaD molecule with CaM. The presence of three functional domains for actin-binding/actomyosin ATPase inhibition in the regions between residues 718–731, 690–699, and 650–666 (Fig. 8) is consistent with the multiple-site model for actin-binding/actomyosin ATPase inhibitory domains proposed by us and others (28Wang C.-L.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25707-25714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both the regions between residues 650–666 and 690–699 consist of 70% uncharged and 30% charged amino acid residues, suggesting that, along with charge-charge interaction and hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction may be involved in the interaction of the CaD and actin that is essential for inhibition of actomyosin ATPase activity by CaD. In summary, the last 99 amino acid residues at the C terminus of CaD contain three functionally independent motifs responsible for actin-binding/actomyosin ATPase inhibition. The three functional domains are structurally discontinuous and are located in the regions between residues 718–731, 690–699, and 650–666, in which the regions between residues 690–699 and 650–666 each also contain a strong CaM-binding site. This precise localization should help to better understand the regulatory mechanisms involved in the interaction of CaD with actin and the regulation of actin-myosin interaction and of actomyosin ATPase.

According to this model, a newly synthesized Rab protein is bound by REP, and the complex is recognized by Rab GGTase, which allows a subsequent digeranylgeranylation of a Rab protein to take place. After prenylation, REP stays associated with the modified Rab and delivers it to its target membrane. Upon membrane association of Rab, REP is released into the cytosol for another round of prenylation and Rab undergoes activation due to GDP/GTP exchange. After GTP hydrolysis, prenylated GDP-bound Rab is subsequently extracted from the membranes by RabGDI (12Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RabGDI can again deliver Rab to a donor membrane, thus restarting the cycle. However, the yeast REP cannot suppress the lethality due to the disruption of the yeast GDI1 gene (13Pfeffer S.R. Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17057-17059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 17Garrett M.D. Zahner J.E. Cheney C.M. Novick P.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1718-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) implying that despite the structural and functional similarities, REP and RabGDI have unique and distinct functionsin vivo. There have been no systematic studies on the intracellular localization of the components of the Rab geranylgeranylation machinery. The catalytic subunits of Rab GGTase are believed to be soluble proteins, like the other prenyl transferases, suggesting that the reaction takes place in the cytoplasm (18Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 45-47Google Scholar, 19Ferro-Novick S. Zerial M. Huber L.A. Guidebook to the Small GTPases.

Here we report that the yeast Rab escort protein Mrs6 is present not only in the soluble but also in the particulate fractions of cell extracts. The biochemical characteristics of the membrane-bound pool of Mrs6p imply that this peripheral association is mediated through hydrophobic interactions and possibly regulated by the availability of divalent cations. Only the membrane-associated form of Mrs6p can be detected in vivoupon deletion of the C terminus of the protein, suggesting that this part of the Mrs6p is essential for maintaining its solubility. The following strains were used in this study: AR4-6A (MATα, ura3, leu2, his3, trp1, ade8, rho+), AR4-6B (MATa,ura3::Gal1-MRS6-URA3,mrs6::HIS3, leu2, his3, trp1, ade8, rho+) (8Benito-Moreno R.M. Miaczynska M. Bauer B.E. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Curr. Genet. 1994; 27: 23-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and X2180–1A (MATa, SUC2, mal, gal2, CUP1). The media YPD, YPGal, SD, and SGal (supplemented with amino acids and bases as required) were previously described (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol.

Genet. 1993; 24: 455-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar. The Mrs6-GDI chimera was constructed as follows: the C-terminal fragment (amino acids 276–442) from the bovine RabGDI was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the plasmid pGEX2TH-RabGDI (kindly provided by Dr. Y. Takai) using the oligonucleotides: GDIBamHI (5′-AGGTGGCCGGATCCAAGCAGCTGATCTGTGACC-3′) and GDIXhoI (5′-CCATCACTGGTCAGCCTCGAGAAAGACATC-3′). The polymerase chain reaction fragment was then cloned into theBamHI site at amino acid 322 of the MRS6 gene. The resulting construct, named M6GDI, was recloned in theXbaI-KpnI sites of the YEplac181 vector (plasmid YEpM6GDI). The plasmids YEpM6PN, YEp351, YEpM6ΔNhe, and YEpM6ΔXba were previously described (7Ragnini A. Teply R. Waldherr M. Voskova A. Schweyen R.J. Curr.

Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For Mrs6p depletion, the strain AR4-6B was precultured in YPGal or, when carrying plasmids, in appropriate selective SGal medium for 48 h. Cells were then washed, diluted toA 600 = 0.05 in YPD and grown for 14 h before harvesting. Absence of the endogenous Mrs6p was determined by immunoblotting analyses as described previously (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For Mrs6p overexpression, the strain AR4-6A was transformed with YEpM6PN (7Ragnini A. Teply R. Waldherr M. Voskova A. Schweyen R.J. Curr. Genet. 1994; 26: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), precultured in −Ura SD medium for 48 h, diluted toA 600 = 0.2 in YPD, and grown at 30 °C for 8 h. Protein extracts were prepared from the wild type strain AR4-6A by glass bead lysis as described (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol.

The membrane fraction was washed once with lysis buffer and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4. Plasma membrane, vacuoles, microsomes (30,000 × g, 40,000 × g, and 100,000 × g subfractions), mitochondria, and mitochondria-associated microsomal fraction (MAM), prepared from the wild type strain X-2180-1A as described (22Zinser E.

Briefly, plasma membrane was obtained by centrifugation of homogenate at 20,000 × g followed by sucrose gradient purification, and vacuoles were isolated by floatation in Ficoll gradients (22Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Mitochondria and MAM fraction were prepared by centrifuging homogenate at 9,000 × g followed by sucrose gradient purification (23Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol.

Microsomes were isolated by differential centrifugation of 20,000 × gpostmitochondrial supernatant at 30,000 × g, 40,000 × g, and 100,000 × g (24Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and were essentially devoid of mitochondria and plasma membrane as determined by immunoblot with porin and Pdr5 antibodies. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Mrs6p and Ypt1p were expressed as His6-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli as described previously (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The anti-Mrs6 polyclonal antibody SLM6–1 (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was used in this study. The anti-Ypt1 polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against the His6-tagged Ypt1p, and the serum was purified on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following polyclonal antibodies were gifts: the anti-glyceraldehyde-phosphate dehydrogenase and anti-porin antibodies from Dr. G. Daum; the anti-Ypt7 antibody from Dr. D. Gallwitz; the anti-Pdr5 antibody from Dr. K. Kuchler; the anti-hexokinase antibody from Dr. G. Schatz; and the anti-Sec61 antibody from Dr. R. Schekman. Western blots and immunodetection were performed as described previously (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) by the ECL method (Amersham Corp.). Geranylgeranylation assay was performed as described (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Aliquots of total membrane fraction (P100; containing 100 μg of protein) from the wild type strain AR4-6A overexpressing Mrs6p were incubated for 30 min on ice with buffer A (50 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 × PIM: 0.1 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm sodium metabisulfite) either with or without the addition of the reagents described in the text in a total volume of 50 μl. The magnesium chloride in buffer A was omitted in the samples treated with EDTA. After 100,000 × g centrifugation, pellets were washed with buffer A and recentrifuged, and aliquots of pellets and supernatants were analyzed by immunoblot. For proteinase K digestion, aliquots of membranes were incubated with increasing concentrations of proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim) in a total volume of 100 μl of buffer A (without 1 × PIM) in the absence or in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 for 30 min on ice followed by the addition of PMSF to 5 mm and incubation for a further 30 min on ice. As a control, PMSF and 100 μg/ml proteinase K were added together and incubated for 60 min on ice. Samples were then centrifuged, and the pellets were washed and analyzed as described above. 200 μg of total protein extract from the strain AR4-6A overexpressing Mrs6p were resuspended in 200 μl of TX buffer (1% Triton X-114, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) incubated on ice for 30 min and subsequently at 37 °C for 5 min. Samples were spun at 16,000 rpm for 2 min at room temperature, and aqueous and detergent phases were separated. 200 μl of TX buffer was added to the aqueous phase, 200 μl of 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, was added to the detergent phase, and the phase separation was repeated. Aqueous and detergent phases from both separations were pooled together and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and aliquots were analyzed by immunoblot. For the binding assays, total microsomal preparations were obtained by 100,000 ×g centrifugation of the postmitochondrial supernatants as described (22Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2853-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and mitochondria were isolated according to Ref. 23Daum G. Böhni P.C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13028-13033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Aliquots (500 μg of protein) of these preparations from the strain AR4-6B depleted of Mrs6p or from the wild type strain AR4-6A were resuspended in buffer A, and the indicated amount of the recombinant Mrs6p was added to a final volume of 100 μl. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were washed with buffer A, recentrifuged at the same speed, dissolved in 2 × SDS sample loading buffer, and analyzed by immunoblot. The amounts of bound Mrs6p were determined by quantitative immunoblot using purified Mrs6p as a standard followed by densitometric scanning of the films with the BIO-PROFIL package BIO-1D software version 6.02c (Biotechnology Division, Vilber Lourmat, Marne-La-Vallee, France).K d values were calculated based on the binding saturation curves using the program GraphPad Prism version 2.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). EDTA pretreatment was performed as follows: total microsomal membranes from the strain AR4-6B depleted of Mrs6p were incubated with 25 mm EDTA on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 × PIM) to which 0.6 μmrecombinant Mrs6p and 150 mm MgCl2, CaCl2, ZnCl2, CuCl2, or MnCl2 was added. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and centrifuged, and pellets were washed in reaction buffer and processed as described above. For the proteinase pretreatment, total microsomal membranes from the strain AR4-6B depleted of Mrs6p were incubated with the indicated increasing concentrations of trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim) in a final volume of 100 μl of buffer A for 30 min on ice, followed by the addition of PMSF to 5 mm and incubation for a further 30 min on ice. As a control, trypsin and PMSF were added simultaneously, and samples were incubated for 60 min on ice. After 100,000 ×g centrifugation, pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of buffer A with 0.1 μm recombinant Mrs6p, incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged, and the pellets were washed in buffer A and processed as above. For binding of the cytosolic Mrs6p to microsomal and mitochondrial membranes, aliquots of purified fractions (50 μg of protein) from the strain AR4-6B depleted of Mrs6p were incubated with increasing amounts of cytosol from the strain AR4-6A overexpressing Mrs6p in a final volume of 50 μl of buffer A for 30 min at 30 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g, and the pellets were washed and analyzed by immunoblot. The particulate or cytosolic distribution of the Mrs6 protein in the wild type yeast cells was determined by subcellular fractionation of yeast extracts and immunoblot analyses. Total protein extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g to separate the soluble (S100) and particulate (P100) material. As shown in Fig.1 A, Mrs6p is found predominantly in the cytosolic fraction (lane S), but a significant portion co-sediments with the particulate fraction (lane P), suggesting that some Mrs6p is membrane-associated. Further analysis showed that the membrane-bound Mrs6p does not co-fractionate with mitochondria, plasma membranes, or vacuoles (Fig.1 A, lanes M, PM, and V, respectively). Because plasma membranes and vacuoles are the targets for Sec4 and Ypt7 proteins, respectively (26Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 27Haas A. Scheglmann D. Lazar T. Gallwitz D. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5258-5270Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), the presence of Mrs6p in the particulate fraction cannot be attributed to its Ypt membrane-delivering activity. This observation is in agreement within vitro studies in which a purified mammalian REP-1-Rab5 complex was used to study the escorting activity of REP-1 (14Alexandrov K. Horiuchi H. Steele-Mortimer O. Seabra M.C. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5262-5273Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). It was estimated that after Rab prenylation only a small fraction (less than 1%) of the REP-1 protein is associated with the membranes of either permeabilized or unpermeabilized MDCK cells. The membrane association of Mrs6p could therefore be an early event in the cycle involving the formation of the Mrs6-Ypt complex. It has been suggested that the mammalian REP, due to its preference for the GDP-bound form of Rab, could act as a true chaperone, binding the Rab protein as it is released from the translational machinery and possibly forcing the nascent Rab into the GDP-bound conformation (28Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14398-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Our results are consistent with this hypothesis, because, as shown in Fig.1 B, we observed that Mrs6p co-fractionates with the microsomal membranes. In particular, Mrs6p is associated with the heavy microsomal fraction (30,000 × g and 40,000 ×g fractions, lanes 30 and 40, respectively), which is enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi membranes (24Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 29Zinser E. Daum G. Yeast. 1995; 11: 493-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), as indicated by Ypt1p enrichment observed in our experiments. Interestingly, Mrs6p was not detected in the light microsomal fraction containing secretory vesicles (100,000 ×g microsomes, lane 100) or in the MAM fraction (lane MAM). The MAM fraction was described previously as a specialized part of endoplasmic reticulum surrounding mitochondria that co-purifies with them and was shown to be enriched in a subset of enzymes involved in phospholipid biosynthesis (24Gaigg B. Simbeni R. Hrastnik C. Paltauf F. Daum G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1234: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In fact our mitochondrial preparation was contaminated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes because Sec61 protein was detectable in mitochondria (Fig.1 A) and porin was detectable in the MAM fraction (Fig.1 B). In contrast, Mrs6p appears to be absent in both these fractions indicating that this protein, although it associates with microsomes, is not evenly distributed through these membranes like Sec61p is. Taken together, our localization data strongly suggest that the membrane-bound form of Mrs6p is present in a specific subcompartment of microsomes. Moreover, because no Mrs6 protein was found in the light microsomal fraction, it is likely that Mrs6p association with membranes is an early event in the Mrs6p cycle and not a consequence of its Rab delivery activity. Treatment of Mrs6p-containing membranes with increasing concentrations of proteinase K results in the complete digestion of membrane-bound Mrs6p, whereas at the same concentrations the integral membrane protein Sec61 is still protected from the enzymatic degradation by the lipid bilayer (Fig. 2). The accessibility of Mrs6p to proteolytic digestion indicates that it is peripherally associated with the membranes and excludes the possibility that our membrane preparation is constituted by inside-out vesicles that have trapped cytosol. To further characterize the nature of the Mrs6p membrane association, the P100 membrane fraction was treated with reagents known to affect different types of protein-membrane interactions, such as electrostatic (treatment with high salt), hydrophobic (treatment with nonionic detergents), metal ion-mediated associations (treatment with chelating agents), or via a post-translational lipid modification such as palmitoylation (treatment with NH2OH). As shown in Fig.3 A, the peripheral association of Mrs6p with membranes was confirmed by sodium carbonate treatment, which resulted in partial extraction of Mrs6p. Carbonate treatment is known to remove ribosomes from rough microsomes, to strip peripheral membrane-bound proteins, to convert sealed vesicles into open sheets, and to effectively release the contents of cisternae (30Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Among the different reagents used to extract Mrs6p, the combined treatment with urea and Triton X-100 was the most effective (Fig. 3 A). Each of these two reagents alone, as well as treatment of the membranes with 25 mm EDTA, was less efficient but still significant. No extraction was observed upon incubation with high salt. The fact that Triton X-100 and/or urea caused solubilization of Mrs6p suggested that membrane binding is mediated by hydrophobic forces (31Penefsky H.S. Tzagoloff A. Methods Ezymol. 1971; 22: 204-219Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), either directly with lipids or through interactions with integral membrane proteins. Because 2.5 m urea causes partial protein denaturation, it is likely that the proper folding of Mrs6p is required for its binding to the membranes. The possibility that post-translational lipid modifications could account for the hydrophobic behavior of Mrs6p was investigated by hydroxylamine treatment and by phase partitioning in Triton X-114. Hydroxylamine treatment at neutral pH is known to solubilize palmitoylated proteins by hydrolyzing the thioester bonds between a palmitate and a cysteine residue of a modified protein (32Magee A.I. Schlesinger M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 694: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 33Magee A.I. Gutierrez L. McKay I.A. Marshall C.J. Hall A. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3353-3357Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Such treatment, however, did not show any effect on the membrane association of Mrs6p (Fig.3 A). The possibility that another lipid modification or the overall hydrophobicity of Mrs6p could be responsible for its association with intracellular membranes was further excluded by phase partitioning in Triton X-114 solution of the total protein extracts containing Mrs6p (Fig. 3 B). Mrs6p was found mainly in the aqueous phase, pointing to an overall hydrophilic character of the protein, in contrast to the lipid modified Ypt1p, which partitions in the detergent fraction. Similar characteristics of membrane binding mediated by hydrophobic forces, despite the overall hydrophilic character of a protein, have been reported for a yeast protein, Vps17, involved in sorting of vacuolar hydrolases (34Köhrer K. Emr S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 559-569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the fraction of mammalian RabGDI detected in the particulate pool is reported to be only loosely associated with intracellular membranes because it can be solubilized by 1 m NaCl, so ionic interactions must be involved in that case (12Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, different forces are responsible for the REP and RabGDI membrane association. To check if we are able to reproduce the binding of Mrs6p to membranesin vitro, we set up an assay using recombinant E. coli-expressed Mrs6p and membrane fractions from the strain AR4-6B depleted of Mrs6p (see “Experimental Procedures”) to avoid a background of the endogenous protein. Our in vitro binding studies show that the E. coli-expressed Mrs6p is able to associate with intracellular membranes in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching saturation at about 2 μm added Mrs6p (Fig.4 A). Membrane-bound recombinant Mrs6p could be solubilized by the same factors as demonstrated for the endogenous protein, pointing to similar biochemical characteristics of in vivo and in vitro association. However, the recombinant Mrs6p was found to be able to bind purified plasma membranes as well as mitochondria from the strain AR4-6B. Nonspecific binding was also observed when the cytosol from cells overexpressing Mrs6p was used as a source of the protein in a similar assay (data not shown). Thus, despite the same behavior of recombinant and endogenous Mrs6p in thein vitro membrane binding assay, the membrane specificity observed in vivo was lost. A similar effect has been reported for the Rab3A protein, which localizes to synaptic plasma membranes and vesicles in rat brain synapses, but the protein purified from bovine brain membranes binds in vitro also to mitochondrial membranes and erythrocyte ghosts (35Araki S. Kikuchi A. Hata Y. Isomura M. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13007-13015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because it is possible that membranes prepared from the Mrs6p depleted strain AR4-6B could lack some factors or components required for the specificity of Mrs6p-membrane association, we repeated the binding assay with mitochondrial and microsomal membranes prepared from the wild type strain (Fig. 4 B). Although Mrs6p was found to bind both types of membranes, the affinity of Mrs6p for the microsomes was higher (K d = 0.22 ± 0.05 μm) than for mitochondrial membranes (K d = 0.53 ± 0.15 μm). The existence of a saturation point in the Mrs6p membrane binding assay suggested a protein-mediated interaction; however, proteinase pretreatment of membranes did not abolish the Mrs6p association in vitro (Fig. 4 C). The co-existence of two membrane-bound forms, a tightly bound and saturable form (protein-mediated binding), as well as a loosely bound and nonsaturable one (binding to lipid bilayers), has been reported for the ADP-ribosylation factor small G protein (36Helms J.B. Palmer D.J. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our results imply that the nature of the Mrs6p allows for hydrophobic interactions with lipid bilayers, whereas other factors are responsible for the specificity observed in vivo. Indeed, REP-1 can be found by gel filtration chromatography to be partly associated with phosphatidylcholine vesicles when the prenylation reaction is carried out in vitro in the presence of phospholipids (15Shen F. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3692-3698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we may speculate that a specific transport step and/or a compartmentalization system could be required to maintain the REP in its site of function and to avoid nonspecific membrane binding in vivo. The fact that treatment of membranes containing endogenous Mrs6p with a chelating agent such as EDTA (Fig. 3 A) results in partial extraction of Mrs6p suggests that its membrane binding in vivo depends to some extent on the presence of divalent cations. To better investigate the participation of divalent cations in the binding of Mrs6p to membranes, we used our in vitro membrane binding assay and observed that pretreatment of the membranes with 25 mm EDTA completely abolishes Mrs6p binding in vitro. Association was restored upon the addition of divalent cations to the assay (Fig. 5). We conclude that bothin vivo and in vitro divalent cations participate in the Mrs6p membrane association. Changes in the concentration of intracellular calcium have been extensively reported to regulate secretion in both mammalian and yeast systems (37Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 38Baker D. Wuestehube L. Schekman R. Botstein D. Segev N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For example, a temperature-sensitive growth defect of the ypt1N121I/A161Vmutant can be suppressed by high extracellular concentrations of Ca2+ (39Schmitt H.D. Puzicha M. Gallwitz D.

Genet. 1994; 26: 308-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We addressed the question of whether the membrane and cytosolic Mrs6p pools could be altered if the activity or the integrity of the protein was affected. We observed that the balance between the membrane-bound and cytosolic Mrs6p is not significantly changed when the wild type Mrs6p is overexpressed (Fig. 6 B). Subsequently, we tested the intracellular distribution of two C-terminal truncated forms of Mrs6p: deletion of 33 amino acids (ΔNhe construct) (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and of 174 amino acids (ΔXba construct) (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) upon overexpression in yeast cells (Fig. 6 A). The Mrs6ΔNhe protein, which is able to complement Mrs6p depletion and causes only a slight reduction in the Rab GGTase activity (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was found mainly in the membrane pellet, but still a significant fraction was present in the cytosolic pool (Fig. 6 B). The inactive Mrs6ΔXba protein was instead detected exclusively in the 100,000 × g pellet (Fig.6 B). Previous studies have shown that this truncated protein is unable to interact with the Ypt1 protein (20Bauer B.E. Lorenzetti S. Miaczynska M. Bui D.M. Schweyen R.J. Ragnini A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1521-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The double effect of the C-terminal deletion on Ypt binding and on Mrs6p partitioning suggests that the soluble Mrs6p pool is dependent on a property conferred to the protein by the presence of the C terminus. The importance of the intact C terminus for proper intracellular distribution of Mrs6p was further supported by the observation that the replacement of the Mrs6p C terminus with the C-terminal part of the bovine RabGDI (Fig. 6 A) does not restore the wild type distribution of the Mrs6p. Such chimeric protein is located in the membrane fraction, similarly to the Mrs6ΔXba protein (Fig. 6 B), whereas RabGDI itself is prevalently cytosolic (12Ullrich O. Stenmark H. Alexandrov K. Huber L.A. Kaibuchi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Zerial M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C terminus of the REP/GDI protein family represents the most variable region among the family members, and crystallographic studies of the bovine RabGDI structure have shown that the RabGDI C terminus together with the structurally conserved region 1 and structurally conserved region 3B constitutes the Rab-binding site (40Schalk I. Zeng K. Wu S.-K. Stura E.A. Matteson J. Huang M. Tandon A. Wilson I.A. Balch W.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Our results show that the C terminus of the Mrs6p cannot be replaced by the C terminus of bovine RabGDI. As summarized in Fig. 6 A, the Mrs6-GDI protein was not able to substitute for the wild type Mrs6p in an in vitro geranylgeranylation assay. Because swapping of the Mrs6p C terminus with the RabGDI C terminus may have altered the Rab/Ypt binding site, it is possible that Ypt binding to Mrs6p is required for maintaining the Mrs6 protein in a soluble conformation. Taken together, our data give new insights into the possible cycle of the REP-Rab/Ypt complex and are consistent with the idea that in the absence of intracellular compartmentalization or of regulated conformational switching, Mrs6p has a tendency to associate with all intracellular membranes. Conformational changes due to the formation of a functional heterodimer between Ypt and REP proteins could mediate the membrane association/dissociation properties of Mrs6p by forcing it into a more hydrophilic conformation. Changes in intracellular ion concentrations could also be a part of the mechanism by which Mrs6p binding to membranes in vivo is regulated.

O-6 of IMP putatively makes a nucleophilic attack on the γ-phosphorus atom of GTP, whereupon the amino group of l-aspartate (ASP) displaces phosphate from C-6 of the intermediate. The direct observation of 6-thiophosphoryl-IMP in the active site of the synthetase (20Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15200-15205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) provides additional support for the proposed mechanism, which, on the basis of initial rate kinetics, is rapid equilibrium random ter ter (25Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isotope exchange studies with the rat muscle enzyme imply a preferred pathway for substrate addition, with aspartate adding to the enzyme after the binding of nucleotides (24Cooper B.F. Fromm H.J. Rudolph F.B. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7323-7327Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Competitive inhibitors for one of the substrates inhibit noncompetitively with respect to the other two substrates, suggesting that substrate binding sites do not overlap (Ref. 1Stayton M.M. Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and references therein). Furthermore, adenylosuccinate (AMPS) is a competitive inhibitor of IMP and a noncompetitive inhibitor of GTP and ASP, a result consistent with overlapping AMPS and IMP binding sites (25Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Residues located in the vicinity of C-6 of IMP should be important in catalysis and/or substrate binding. Directed mutation, kinetics, and molecular modeling (19Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 26Wang W. Poland B.W.

Chem. 1995; 270 (2nd Ed.): 13160-13163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) revealed the significance of Arg305 to the recognition of ASP and the stabilization of the transition state. The putative binding of Arg305 to the α-carboxylate of ASP may bring the amino group of ASP into close contact with C-6 of IMP (19Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, Arg305 is probably not a significant factor in the formation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP. Positions corresponding to 224 are occupied either by Gln or Asn in 12 of the 13 known sequences of AMPSase. The side chain of Gln224 hydrogen bonds to N-7 and O-6 of IMP (19Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). On the basis of results presented below, Gln224 is essential for catalysis. Furthermore, the mutation of Gln34 to glutamate causes a 60-fold decline in k cat, attributed to the disruption of a hydrogen bond between Gln34 and Gln224, that was observed in ligated crystal structures (19Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, alanine mutations of Leu228 and Ser240, which are conserved residues near bound IMP, had little effect on the kinetics of the synthetase. GTP, IMP, l-aspartate, adenylosuccinate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. A site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Amersham Corp. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega. E. coli strain XL-1 blue was obtained from Stratagene. An E. coli purA − strain H1238 (thr-25, tonA49, argF58, purA54, argI61) and an E. coli purB − strain H680 (fhuA2, lacY1, tsx-70, glnV44(AS), gal-6, λ-, purB51, trpC45, his-68, tyrA2, rspL125(strR), malT1(λ R ), xylA7, mtlA2, thi-1) were obtained from Dr. B. Bachman, Genetic Center, Yale University. 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were obtained from Millipore Corp. Other reagents and chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant DNA manipulation employed standard procedures (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid containing a 1.8-kilobase pair BamHI-HindIII fragment from PMS204, ligated into PUC118, was used in mutagenesis. The mutagenesis primers were as follows: 5′-tgaccgccctcgtagcgtacaa-3′ for Q34E, 5′-atccagcagcgtacccatcgcaccttc-3′ for Q224M, 5′-atccagcagcgtaccctccgcaccttc-3′ for Q224E, 5′-gatatccagcgccagcgtacc-3′ for L228A, and 5′-gtgttggaagcagttacgtacg-3′ for S240A. The underlined bases are changes from the original sequence. The primers used to sequence DNA in the vicinity of residues 224–240 and 34 are 5′-ATGGCTGTTGCCGACATC-3′ and 5′-GACGAAGGTAAAGGTAAG-3′, respectively. All primers were synthesized on a Bioresearch 8570EX automated DNA synthesizer at the nucleic acids facility at Iowa State University. Mutagenesis was carried out according to the protocol provided by Amersham. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the chain termination method (28Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52671) Google Scholar) at the nucleic acids facility. The 1.8-kilobase pair BamHI-HindIII fragment with the right mutation was ligated back into PMS204, which was used in the transformation of XL-1 blue cells. The plasmids isolated from that strain were used to transform E. coli purA −H1238, the strain used for protein expression. Protein concentration, defined in terms of monomers, was determined by the method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216428) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Molecular mass was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy (30Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography, Cibacron blue affinity chromatography, and DEAE-TSK high pressure liquid chromatography, as described elsewhere (31Bass M.B. Fromm H.J. Stayton M.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 32Kang C. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but subject to the following modifications. Enzyme was eluted from a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column by a series of potassium phosphate-buffered solutions: 0.6m, 0.4 m, and 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4 in 50 mmpotassium phosphate (pH 7.0). The wild-type and most of the mutant enzymes appeared in the 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4 solution. A large fraction (80%) of the Q224E mutant, however, appeared in the 0.4m (NH4)2SO4 solution. Enzyme purity was monitored by SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). Because of the slower growth rate of transformed cells and the elevated expression of the Q224E mutant relative to the wild-type enzyme, we performed Western blots on wild-type, Q224M, and Q224E AMPSases to verify that our isolated mutant enzymes were indeed modifications of AMPSase. Two sets of 0.5 μg of Q224M, Q224E, and wild-type AMPSases and 1 μg of adenylosuccinate lyase (AMPS lyase) were separated by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. A rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:5000) and the standard detection techniques (AuroProbe BLPlus and intenSE BL system, Amersham) were used to visualize the signals. UV difference spectra were obtained on a GBC UV/VIS 918 spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-Effect temperature controller, using the program λ Scan from 300 to 220 nm. The reaction buffer contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), 300 μm GTP, 450 μm IMP, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm ASP, and excess AMPS lyase. 1 μg/ml wild-type AMPSase or 300 μg/ml Q224E mutant enzyme was used in the scan. The spectra obtained at time 0 were subtracted from the spectra collected at subsequent time points (Fig.1). A coupled assay method monitoring the production of AMP employed UV difference spectroscopy. Excess AMPS lyase was used in the reaction mixture to convert all the AMPS into AMP. The increase in absorbance at 275 nm was monitored using a Δε = 15.0 × 106cm2/mol, which was derived by comparing thek cat values for wild-type enzyme using the assay method described elsewhere (34Rudolph, F. B. (1971) Purification, Properties, and Kinetics of Adenylosuccinate Synthetase from Escherichia coli, Ph.D. thesis, Iowa State University, Ames, IA.Google Scholar) and the method developed in this study. The concentrations of stock solutions for GTP and IMP were determined using their extinction coefficients at 253 and 248 nm, respectively. Enzyme assays contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.7), and 5 mmMgCl2. When GTP was the variable substrate, ASP was fixed at 5 mm, and IMP was fixed at 450 μm. When IMP was the variable substrate, GTP was fixed at 300 μm, and ASP was fixed at 5 mm. When ASP was the variable substrate, GTP was fixed at 300 μm, and IMP was fixed at 450 μm. Circular dichroism spectra for the wild-type enzyme and the mutant enzymes were acquired on a JASCO J700. Samples (100 μg/ml) were placed in a 1-cm cuvette, and data were collected in increments of 0.1 nm. Each spectrum was corrected for background contributions of the buffer and smoothed. The data were analyzed by software associated with the spectrometer or by PSIPLOT. Fluorescence measurements, using 1-cm quartz cuvettes, were carried out in a SLM 8000C spectrofluorometer. The proteins were excited at 290 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 400 nm. Each sample contained 200 μg/ml protein in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.7). Solutions containing 0–1.5n guanidium hydrochloride were used in denaturation experiments. k cat versus pH profiles for the wild-type and the Q224E mutant were studied to gain additional data relevant to our proposals regarding the catalytic mechanism of the synthetase and the role in that mechanism played by the side chain at position 224. Mes and Hepes were chosen as buffers for the pH range 5.5–8.5, where the wild-type enzyme is active. The assay solution contained 300 μmGTP, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ASP, and 20 mm Mes/Hepes buffer at different pH values. IMP concentrations varied from 25 to 500 μm. 300 μg/ml Q224E mutant or 1 μg/ml wild-type AMPSase with excess AMPS lyase were used in the assays. Longer assay times (5–10 min) compensated for the lower activity of the Q224E mutant enzyme. Sequences of AMPSase from different sources were aligned using the PILEUP option of the GCG sequence analysis package. Positions equivalent to 224 are occupied by asparagine in four sequences, glutamine in eight sequences, and arginine in the AMPSase from Brucella abortus, suggesting a significant role for the amide side chain at this position (TableI). Indeed, Gln224 hydrogen bonds to the 6-oxo and N-7 of IMP in a crystal structure of the ligated synthetase (19Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Position 34 is occupied by glutamine in 10 of 13 sequences. In ligated crystal structures of the E. coli enzyme, NE2 of Gln34 hydrogen bonds to OE1 of Gln224, properly orienting the amide side chain of Gln224 with respect to bound IMP (Fig. 2). Positions 228 and 240 are leucine and serine, respectively, in all known sequences of the synthetase. The side chain of Leu228 packs against the base of IMP, whereas OG of Ser240 hydrogen bonds to the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP by way of a bridging water molecule.Table IAlignment of E. coli AMPSase amino acid sequences 33–35, 223–230, and 240–241 with the sequences of the AMPSase from other sourcesSpeciesSequences33–35223–230240–241Bacillus subtilisYQGAQGVMLDISSB. abortusYQGRRALLDNSSDictyostelium dicoidiumCQGAQSTMLDLSSE. coliYQGAQGTLLDISSHomo sapiensCQGANAALLDISSHaemophilus influenzaeYQCAQGTMLDISSMus musculusCQGANAALLDISSPyrococcus sp.GGVTQGFGLSLSKSaccharomyces cerevisiaeCAGANALMLDISSSchizosaccharomyces pombeCQGANALMLDLSSSpiroplasma citriWAGAQGVMLDLSSThiobaccilus ferrooxidantsFQCAQCTLLDVSSVibrio parahaemolyticusYQCAQGTLLDISSConserved residues corresponding to Gln34, Gln224,Leu228, Ser240 in E. coliAMPSase are in boldface type. Open table in a new tab Conserved residues corresponding to Gln34, Gln224,Leu228, Ser240 in E. coliAMPSase are in boldface type. All the enzymes reported in this study exhibited greater than 95% purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular mass of the synthetase by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectroscopy was 46 kDa, consistent with the calculated molecular mass of its polypeptide chain. Q224E grew much slower on LB agar plates and in liquid media. Cultures yielded a cell mass of 1.5 g/liter, one-third of that produced by the wild-type strain. However, the yield of purified AMPSase was 15 mg/g of cells, a 15-fold increase relative to the wild-type strain. This phenomenon of reduced cell mass and increased enzyme expression has not been observed for any other mutant of AMPSase. No activity was detected using the assay method of Rudolph and Fromm (25Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3832-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or Kang and Fromm (32Kang C. Fromm H.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The isolated protein was identified as a mutant of AMPSase by Western blot and complementation experiments using H680 and H1238 as the recipient strains. The wild-type, Q224M, and Q224E enzymes were recognized by the antibody for AMPSase, whereas AMPS lyase was not (data not shown). In M9 minimal medium, the Q224M, and Q224E mutant plasmids complemented adenine auxotrophy ofpurA − in H1238 but notpurB − in H680. The CD spectra of the mutant and wild-type enzymes were superimposable (data not shown) from 200 to 260 nm. These observations indicated the absence of global conformational changes or the disruption of the secondary structure. The kinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant AMPSases were determined in pH 7.7 Hepes buffer (Table II). No significant change in the K m values for GTP or ASP was observed for Q224E or Q224M enzymes relative to the wild-type enzyme. The Q224M mutant displayed a 5-fold increase in KmIMP, and a 13-fold decrease ink cat relative to the wild-type enzyme. On the other hand, the Q224E mutant, with only marginal changes inK m for all three substrates, exhibited a decrease ink cat of 4 orders of magnitude relative to wild-type AMPSase. Specificity constants (k cat/K m ) for the Q224M mutant decreased 16-, 75-, and 14-fold for GTP, IMP, and ASP, respectively, relative to the wild-type enzyme, compared with an almost 104-fold decrease for specificity constants of the Q224E mutant for all substrates. These findings implicate Gln224not only in the recognition of IMP but also in a critical catalytic function. The catalytic role of Gln224 had not been recognized previously on the basis of ligated crystal structures, but it is in harmony with the suggestion of Poland et al. (19Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that IMP binds to the active site as the 6-oxyanion (see below).Table IIKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant AMPSases from E. coliProteink catK m GTPK m IMPK m ASPk cat/K m GTPk cat/K m IMPk cat/K m ASPs −1μmμmmm(s · μm) −1(s · μm) −1(s · mm) −1Wild type1.00 ± 0.0553.5 ± 6.2159.6 ± 4.630.35 ± 0.02(1.87 ± 0.23) × 10−2(1.68 ± 0.15) × 10−22.87 ± 0.22Q34E(1.68 ± 0.00) × 10−2(1.09 ± 0.02) × 10379.8 ± 7.710.52 ± 0.04(1.54 ± 0.03) × 10−5(2.11 ± 0.20) × 10−4(3.23 ± 0.30) × 10−2Q224M0.07 ± 0.0060.5 ± 7.32316 ± 42.10.35 ± 0.04(1.16 ± 0.14) × 10−3(2.22 ± 0.30) × 10−4(2.00 ± 0.12) × 10−1Q224E(1.76 ± 0.13) × 10−468.9 ± 6.1050.5 ± 5.870.32 ± 0.05(2.55 ± 0.29) × 10−6(3.49 ± 0.48) × 10−6(5.50 ± 0.94) × 10−4L228A0.28 ± 0.0183.9 ± 9.24137 ± 9.001.06 ± 0.10(3.33 ± 0.39) × 10−3(2.04 ± 0.15) × 10−3(2.64 ± 0.27) × 10−1S240A0.69 ± 0.02115 ± 12.982.5 ± 5.490.38 ± 0.02(6.00 ± 1.22) × 10−3(8.36 ± 0.71) × 10−31.82 ± 0.32Experimental conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Experimental conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The substitution of Gln34 with glutamate resulted in a 60-fold decrease in k cat. Atom N-E2 of Gln34 hydrogen bonds with O-E1 of Gln224, which putatively orients Gln224 in its interaction with IMP. The Q34E mutant may force a 180° rotation of the amide side chain of Gln224 (see below). However, in the case of the Q34E mutant, one cannot rule out other explanations for the observed loss of activity, since the KmGTP also increased 20-fold relative to the wild-type enzyme. Gln34is about 10 Å away from the GTP site, suggesting a conformational change over a significant distance. Alanine substitution of Leu228 and Ser240resulted in 3.6- and 1.4-fold decreases in k cat, respectively, relative to the wild-type enzyme. The side chain of Leu228 may contribute to the proper orientation of the base of IMP; however, Ser240 apparently plays no significant role in the recognition of IMP or in catalysis. The fluorescence emission spectra of the mutants, Q34E, Q224M, and Q224E, and the wild-type enzyme were collected in the presence of different concentrations of guanidium chloride. The emission maximum was 333 nm for the mutants and wild-type enzymes in the absence of guanidium chloride, and gradually shifted to 350 nm in the presence of increasing concentrations of guanidium chloride up to 1.5 n (data not shown). Mutations at residues 34 and 224, then, did not change protein stability in the presence of denaturants relative to the wild-type enzyme. Acting as hydrogen donors or acceptors, the amide side chains of glutamine and asparagine do not ionize, whereas glutamate and aspartate may undergo ionization. Replacing the amide group of Gln224 with a carboxylate group resulted in a decrease in k cat of 4 orders of magnitude, whereas substrate affinity, as measured byK m, underwent only a modest change. We decided to study the pH-dependent kinetics for the wild-type and Q224E mutant enzymes to correlate enzyme activity with the state of protonation of Glu224. Titration curves for mutant and wild-type enzyme are typically bell-shaped for k cat versus pH profiles (Fig. 3). KmIMP for mutant and wild-type enzymes showed a maximum 2-fold change over the pH range 5.5–8.5. The optimum pH for wild-type AMPSase is 7.7, and that for the Q224E mutant is 6.2. At pH 6.2, only a 20-fold decrease ink cat was observed for the Q224E mutant relative to the wild-type enzyme. Protonation of the side chain of Glu224 may be responsible for the increase in relative activity of the Q224E mutant as the pH decreases from 7.7 to 6.2. It is not possible, however, to rule out the suggestion that mutation of Gln224 to Glu results in a localized environmental change that affects the pK value of another critical residue. The properties of Q224M, Q224E, and Q34E mutants of AMPSase can be understood in relation to the crystal structure of the IMP·NO3− complex (19Poland B.W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4 A), Asp13and Gln224 putatively work in concert to stabilize the 6-oxyanion of IMP. Donor-acceptor distances between relevant atoms of Gln34, Gln224, Asp13, and IMP are consistent with the hydrogen bonding of Fig. 4 A. Furthermore, a D13A mutant has no observed activity (35Kang C. Sun N. Poland B.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11881-11895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), consistent with its proposed role as a catalytic base. The Q34E mutant could disrupt the hydrogen bond between Gln224 and O-6 of IMP by enforcing a conformational change on Gln224 (Fig. 4 B). However, there is some uncertainty in this interpretation because the Q34E mutant has no effect on KmIMP but does significantly increase KmGTP. Thus, the decrease in k cat observed for the Q34E mutant may stem from conformational changes in addition to those represented in Fig. 4 B. As the K m values for substrates are not significantly perturbed by the mutation Q224M, the decrease ink cat most likely emanates from the loss of hydrogen bonds to N-7 and O-6 of IMP, the latter probably having the largest impact on catalysis (Fig. 4 C). The greater reduction in k cat for the Q224E mutant than for the Q224M mutant may stem from the localization of a negative charge in proximity to O-6 of IMP (Fig. 4 D). Partial restoration of activity at pH 6.2, then, is due putatively to the protonation of Glu224, which reforms the critical hydrogen bond to O-6 of IMP (Fig. 4 D). The failure to restore the Q224E mutant to 100% of the wild-type enzyme activity at pH 6.2 may be a consequence of (i) tautomeric states that put the proton onto O-6 (Fig.4 E) and/or (ii) the absence of the N-7 to Gln224hydrogen bond, an absence that may undermine the stability of the hydrogen bond between Glu224 and O-6 of IMP. The physiological importance of Gln224 is supported further by the phenomenon of reduced cell proliferation in combination with enhanced protein expression for the mutant Q224E. Mutation of essential catalytic residues severely inhibits the growth of E. coliin the case of D13A and H41N mutants (35Kang C. Sun N. Poland B.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11881-11895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The kinetic data imply that a disruption of the purine nucleotide pathway may impair the reproductive capacity of the organism. The enhanced level of expression of the Q224E mutant may be a self-rescuing strategy of E. coli, to compensate for the impaired AMPSase and to promote adenylate synthesis by the purine nucleotide salvage pathway. It is unclear, however, why this mechanism of recovery is not operative in the case of the D13A or H41N mutant. Perhaps these mutants of AMPSase impair adenylate biosynthesis so severely that E. colicannot sustain transcription and translation processes for overproduction of a given protein."

Renin is a rate-limiting enzyme of the renin-angiotensin system that regulates blood pressure and water-electrolyte balance. Renin gene expression is regulated in a tissue-specific and developmentally linked manner. Similarly, the expression of RB is controlled in a differentiation-linked manner. Thus, to investigate whether RB is involved in the regulation of renin gene expression, we examined the effects of RB on transcriptional activity of the mouse renin (Ren-1C) promoter. TheRen-1C promoter contains two transcriptionally important elements; the RU-1 (−224 to −138) and RP-2 (−75 to −47) elements. RB activated the Ren-1C promoter in human embryonic kidney cells. The promoter element responsible for RB-mediated transcriptional regulation was the RP-2 element. The results of DNA-protein binding experiments showed that RB increased nuclear binding activity to the RP-2 element, and site-directed mutation which disrupted binding of nuclear factors to the RP-2 element markedly reduced RB-mediated activation of Ren-1C promoter in human embryonic kidney cells. These results indicate that the RP-2 element plays an important role in RB-mediated transcriptional regulation of Ren-1Cpromoter activity in human embryonic kidney cells, thereby suggesting an interesting mechanism by which RB may modulate the renin-angiotensin system.

Although RB is ubiquitously expressed, recently it has been reported that the amounts of RB are varied in specific cell types of normal tissues, and maturing cells possess higher levels of RB than their progenitors, indicating that the expression of RB is regulated during the process of differentiation in several cells and tissues (39Cordon-Cardo C. Richon V.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 500-510PubMed Google Scholar). Renin is mainly produced in the kidney, and renin gene expression is regulated in a developmentally linked manner. Since RB mRNA is also expressed abundantly in the kidney (40Chen G. Guy C.T. Chen H.-W. Hu N. Lee E.Y.-H.P. Lee W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9567-9572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), it is possible that RB modulates expression of the renin gene in the kidney. In the present study, we showed that RB activated transcription of theRen-1C gene in HEK cells. The proximal promoter region from −75 to +16 of the Ren-1C gene mediated the transcriptional activation by RB. We demonstrated that the RP-2 element (−75 to −47) which overlapped the TATA-like region was the major contributor to the regulation of Ren-1C promoter activity by RB in HEK cells. pUCSV3CAT contained the coding sequence for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fused with the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer/promoter sequence and polyadenylation signal (41Fukamizu A.

Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Construction of TK-CAT was described previously (42Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The RU-1 or RP-2 elements with or without the other element were linked upstream of R47CAT or TK-CAT in 5′ to 3′ orientation. R365CAT was used as a template to construct mutations in the RP-2 element (m(RP-2) element) by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (43Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). The sequences of the oligonucleotide used to create m(RP-2) element were 5′-CCCTGGGGTAccgAcTCAAAGCAGAGCCT-3′. Once the mutations were obtained and confirmed by sequencing, the altered 381-base pair (−365 to +16) fragment was subcloned into theBglII/HindIII sites of pUCSV0CAT (R365 m[RP-2]CAT). To construct plasmid pC/RP-2, six tandem copies of a synthetic double-stranded RP-2 element (5′-CCCTGGGGTAATAAATCAAAGCAGAGCCT-3′) were inserted into theBglII site of pUC19 as described previously (44Tamura K. Umemura S. Ishii M. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1370-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To construct pC/m(RP-2), six tandem copies of the m[RP-2] element were inserted into the BglII site of pUC19. HEK cells were maintained in minimum essential medium containing 10% heat-denatured horse serum (14Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). HeLa and T98G cells were cultured in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. These cell lines were kept in 5% CO2 and plated approximately 24 h before transfection at a density of 5 × 105 cells in 60-mm diameter plastic dishes. RB expression vector phuRb or pUC19 plasmid with Ren-1C promoter-CAT hybrid genes were transiently cotransfected into cultured cells as described previously (14Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Media were replaced with fresh media 24 h after transfection, cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and aliquots of cell extracts containing equal amounts of total protein (40 μg) were used for CAT assay. CAT assay was performed as described previously (14Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and results were normalized on the basis of protein concentration or β-galactosidase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. The conversion ratios of [14C]chloramphenicol were measured with an image analysis system (BAS2000; Fujix, Tokyo, Japan). All experiments were performed at least four times for each construct. Nuclear extracts from HEK cells were prepared using a modification of the protocol of Dignamet al. (14Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A.

Invest. 1994; 94: 1959-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The final protein concentration was 5–7 mg/ml. In some instances, cultured cells were transfected with the RB expression vector phuRb 36 h before the preparation of nuclear extracts. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed essentially as described previously (14Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 44Tamura K. Umemura S. Ishii M. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Clin.

Briefly, nuclear extracts were preincubated for 15 min on ice in 20-μl reaction mixtures containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12% glycerol, and 500 ng of double-stranded poly(dI-dC). Non-labeled competitor was included in some of the binding reactions as indicated. The synthetic double-stranded RP-2 element (5′-CCCTGGGGTAATAAATCAAAGCAGAGCCT-3′ −75 to −47) and the double-stranded DNA fragment of RU-1 element (−224 to −138) were phosphorylated on its 5′-ends by T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and used as the probes. Aliquots of 0.1 to 0.4 ng (approximately 15,000 cpm) of the probe were added and incubation was continued for 30 min at room temperature. The incubation mixture was loaded on to a 4% polyacrylamide gel in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mmglycine, and 1 mm EDTA, and electrophoresed at 140 V for 3 h followed by autoradiography. Radioactivity of shifted bands on the gel was quantified using a BAS2000 FUJIX BIO-Imaging Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film). Double-stranded synthetic DNAs containing the consensus binding sequences for Sp-1 were obtained from Stratagene (GELSHIF™ KIT, La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotides for the RP-2 element, m(RP-2) element, Pit-1/GH-1 (47Kapiloff M.S. Farkash Y. Wegner M. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1991; 253: 786-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and CREB/ATF (48Deutsch P.J. Jameson J.L. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12169-12174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were synthesized on a MilliGen/Bioresearch Cyclone™ Plus oligonucleotide synthesizer, and purified on OPC columns (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. DNase I footprinting was performed essentially as described previously (44Tamura K. Umemura S. Ishii M. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1370-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 45Tamura K. Umemura S. Yamaguchi S. Iwamoto T. Kobayashi S. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. Ishii M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1959-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, theRen-1C promoter fragment from −114 to +16 relative to the transcriptional start site was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, followed by digestion withDdeI (−18) to generate a probe. After gel purification, the probe (approximately 15,000 cpm) was incubated with nuclear extracts in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10% glycerol, and 1 μg of double-stranded poly(dI-dC). The mixtures were incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by 1 min at room temperature with addition of 50 μl of a solution containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5–250 ng of DNase I. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 μl of 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.6 m sodium acetate, pH 7, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 20 μg of tRNA. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform (1:1, v/v) and precipitated with 2.5 volumes of ethanol prior to electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea sequencing gel. To define the position of the protected region, G + A sequence ladders were prepared (49Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). Cotransfection of phuRb activated CAT expression directed by the Ren-1C promoter from −365 to +16 (R365CAT) in HEK cells (Fig. 1). In contrast, this promoter region was not able to mediate the activation by RB in HeLa, T98G, and NIH 3T3 cells. This inactivity in nonrenal cells was not caused by a lower transfection efficiency, since expression directed by pUCSV3CAT was similar in HEK and these nonrenal cells. Then, HEK cells were cotransfected with R365CAT and phuRb DNA or pJ3Ω plasmid (Fig. 2). The level of CAT activity was proportional to the amount of cotransfected phuRb DNA in the range of 3 to 6 μg of DNA. In contrast, cotransfection of phuRb did not have any significant effect on CAT expression directed by the TK promoter (TK-CAT). Next, to define DNA sequences responsible for transcriptional activation of the Ren-1C promoter by RB in HEK cells, a series of 5′-deletion mutants extending from −365 to −47 were constructed and tested for their ability to promote transcription. HEK cells were cotransfected with a 5′-deletion construct and phuRb DNA or pJ3Ω plasmid (Fig. 3). R365CAT activated CAT expression to a significant level (3.2-fold increase) on cotransfection with phuRb, and only the 91-base pairRen-1C promoter sequences (−75 to +16) were required to elicit the RB-induced expression of the CAT reporter gene in HEK cells (Fig. 3, R75CAT). Although the induction ratios of all mutants with deletion end points up to −75 (R75CAT) were relatively constant, deletion of the sequences from −75 to −48 (RP-2 element) abolished the induction of CAT activity by RB (R47CAT). These results indicated that the induction of CAT expression by RB was dependent onRen-1C proximal promoter sequences, and suggested that the RP-2 element from −75 to −47 was important for RB-inducedRen-1C gene promoter activity. To assess the functional importance of the RU-1 and RP-2 elements in Ren-1C promoter activation by RB, we first fused these elements with or without the other element in 5′ to 3′ orientation to the Ren-1C promoter (Fig. 4 A). A construct with a combination of the RU-1 and RP-2 elements ([RU-1/RP-2]R47CAT) efficiently activated the Ren-1C promoter on cotransfection with phuRb (3.9-fold). The RP-2 element alone ([RP-2]R47CAT) also supported RB-inducible activation of Ren-1C promoter (4.3-fold), although the relative CAT activity of [RP-2]R47CAT in the presence or absence of RB was significantly lower than that of [RU-1/RP-2]R47CAT. In contrast, [RU-1]R47CAT, which contained the RU-1 element alone, as well as the control R47CAT, was not able to confer RB inducibility. To further establish the functional roles of the RU-1 and RP-2 elements in directing RB-induced CAT expression, the RU-1 and/or RP-2 elements were linked upstream of a TK promoter-CAT hybrid gene. As shown in Fig.4 B, [RU-1/RP-2]TK-CAT elicited RB-induced expression of the CAT-reporter gene (3.2-fold activation). In addition, the RP-2 element alone mediated transcriptional activation by RB ([RP-2]TK-CAT, 2.5-fold activation). In contrast, the RU-1 element alone ([RU-1]TK-CAT) did not confer the RB inducibility although this element activated the TK promoter in an RB-independent manner. These results suggested that the RU-1 element functioned as a constitutive activator of TK promoter, and that the RP-2 element was necessary not only for basal Ren-1C promoter activity but also for RB-mediated activation of Ren-1C and TK promoters. The above results suggested that the RP-2 element was involved in RB-mediated activation of CAT expression directed by theRen-1C promoter. We previously demonstrated that HEK cell-dominant nuclear factors bound to the RP-2 element by EMSA (14Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of RB on binding of nuclear factors to this element, we first performed DNase I footprint analysis (Fig.5). A labeled DNA fragment from −114 to −19 was incubated with HEK cell nuclear extracts followed by DNase I digestion. The results shown in Fig. 5 A indicated that a sequence from −68 to −55 in the RP-2 element overlapping the TATA-like region (TAATAAA; −67 to −61, Fig. 5 B) was protected from digestion by DNase I (lanes 2–5, denoted by thehatched box, Fig. 5 A). The pattern of DNase I footprinting disclosed increased protection on cotransfection with phuRb (lanes 8–11, Fig. 5 A). We next carried out EMSA using the RP-2 element as a probe (Fig.6 A). Incubation of HEK cell nuclear extracts with this element produced a single shifted band, and cotransfection with phuRb tended to increase the intensity of the shifted band derived from nuclear factors binding to the RP-2 element. The shifted band was specifically competed out by the unlabeled RP-2 element and by a DNA fragment including the promoter region from −75 to +16, but not by a promoter fragment from −47 to +16 (lanes 1–3, andlanes 9 and 10, Fig. 6 A). Previous studies showed that the human renin gene promoter basal and cAMP stimulated activities in gonadocorticotrope and chorionic cells were dependent upon the presence of the pituitary-specifictrans-acting factor (Pit-1/GH-1)-binding site (−79 to −64) bearing partial sequence similarity to the RP-2 element (50Sun J. Oddoux C. Lazarus A. Gilbert M.T. Catanzaro D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1505-1508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 51Sun J. Oddoux C. Gilbert M.T. Yan Y. Lazarus A. Campbell Jr., W.G. Catanzaro D.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 52Gilbert M.T. Sun J. Yan Y. Oddoux C. Lazarus A. Tansey W.P. Lavin T.N. Catanzaro D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28049-28054Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, transcription factors Sp-1 and CREB/ATF have been reported to mediate transcriptional activation by RB (27Kim S.-J. Wagner S. O'Reilly M.A. Lui F. Robbins P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28Kim S.-J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2455-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that a Sp-1, CREB/ATF, or Pit-1 family transcription factors bind to the RP-2 element. However, double-stranded synthetic DNAs containing the consensus binding sites for Sp-1, CREB/ATF, or Pit-1/GH-1 did not compete efficiently with the RP-2 element binding activity (lanes 6–8, Fig. 6 A). We performed EMSA using the RU-1 element as a probe to show binding of phuRb (−) and phuRb (+) extracts to the RU-1 element as a control for extract quality (Fig. 6 B). The intensity of the shifted bands derived from nuclear factors binding to the RU-1 element did not show any significant change by cotransfection with phuRb (lanes 2 and 3, Fig. 6 B). Therefore, with the result of EMSA using the RP-2 element as the probe, the overexpression of RB is considered to enhance specifically the binding of nuclear factors to the RP-2 element. From the above results, the RP-2 element seems to exert a critical influence on RB-mediated promoter activity of theRen-1C gene in HEK cells. Thus, to evaluate the functional significance of the RP-2 element in RB-mediated Ren-1Cpromoter activity, we first assayed the effects of a mutation that disrupted binding of nuclear factors to this element. Although the DNA-protein complex formed by the RP-2 element binding activity could be competed out by non-labeled RP-2 element, the m(RP-2) element, that contained substitution mutations interrupting the TATA-like region protected on DNase I footprinting analysis at positions −68 to −55, did not compete out this binding (lanes 2–4, Fig.6 A). In transiently transfected HEK cells, Ren-1Cpromoter-CAT hybrid gene with this mutated RP-2 element (R365 m[RP-2]CAT) showed a significant decrease in RB-mediated promoter activity (Fig. 7). We next performed in vivocompetition experiments to confirm the functional role of the RP-2 element as an RB-mediated positive regulator. Six tandem copies of RP-2 or m(RP-2) elements were inserted into pUC19. These plasmids, named pC/RP-2 or pC/m(RP-2), were cotransfected with R365CAT into HEK cells, and the CAT activities were analyzed (Fig. 8). The amount of transfected DNA was normalized by pUC19 to 18 μg. The results obtained in this experiment showed that CAT activity decreased with increasing amounts of pC/RP-2, but not with pC/m(RP-2). Therefore, these functional assays further suggest that the RP-2 element overlapping the TATA-like region from −67 to −61 is important for RB-mediated activation of Ren-1C promoter in HEK cells.Figure 8In vivo competition analysis of the RP-2 element in RB-mediated Ren-1C promoter activity. A, competitive plasmid (pC/RP-2) containing six tandem copies of the RP-2 element or pC/m(RP-2) containing six copies of the m(RP-2) element was used in this experiment. R365CAT (3 μg) and phuRb (6 μg) were transiently cotransfected into HEK cells, with increasing amounts of either pC/RP-2 or pC/m(RP-2). The amount of transfected DNA was normalized by pUC19.

All of the mouse renin genes (Ren-1C, Ren-1D, and Ren-2 genes) are expressed abundantly and equivalently in the kidney, and 5′-flanking regions of these genes are highly homologous to around 79 nucleotides upstream from the transcriptional start site (18Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. Hypertension ( Dallas ). 1991; 18: 446-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 19Burt D.W. Nakamura N. Kelley P. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7357-7362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We supposed that the highly homologous 5′-flanking regions were involved in the basal and stimulated transcriptional activity of these renin genes. Thus, in this and previous studies we have focused on the promoter region from −365 to +16 of the Ren-1C gene (14Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 15Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Biochim. Biophys.

Invest. 1994; 94: 1959-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that the Ren-1C promoter region from −365 to +16 mediated HEK cell-dominant transcriptional activity and that combination of the RU-1 (−224 to −138) and RP-2 (−75 to −47) elements efficiently induced transcription from the Ren-1Cpromoter (14Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that the promoter region from −365 to +16 (R365CAT) directed the activation of CAT expression by RB, and indicated that the proximal promoter region from −75 to +16 (R75CAT) was sufficient to confer this inducibility by RB. The functional role of the RU-1 element in RB-induced Ren-1Cpromoter activity was similar to that in basal transcriptional activity. We previously showed that the RU-1 element efficiently directed transcription of Ren-1C promoter only in combination with the RP-2 element (14Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3617-3623Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 45Tamura K. Umemura S. Yamaguchi S. Iwamoto T. Kobayashi S. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. Ishii M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1959-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results in this study showed that the RU-1 element alone did not confer RB responsiveness onRen-1C and TK promoters, and suggested that the RU-1 element is a constitutive activator-like region. On the other hand, the RP-2 element seemed to be essential for RB-mediated induction. We performed DNase I footprint analysis to identify the nature of the DNA binding activities which occurred at the RP-2 element. We demonstrated that nuclear factors in HEK cell nuclear extracts bound to the region from −68 to −55 in the RP-2 element, overlapping the TATA-like region. The activation of gene transcription in response to stimuli usually involves the induction of nuclear binding factors. DNase I footprinting in this study disclosed increased protection in the RP-2 element by RB, and EMSA showed that the binding activities of nuclear factors to the RP-2 element were increased by RB. The results of deletion analyses and heterologous promoter assay indicated that the RP-2 element was able to confer RB inducibility, and site-directed mutation that disrupted nuclear binding activity to the RP-2 element greatly decreased this RB-mediated activation of CAT expression. Furthermore, in vivo competition of RB binding in transfected HEK cells markedly decreased RB-mediated CAT expression directed by the Ren-1Cpromoter. These results suggest that the RP-2 element is responsible for RB-induced promoter activity of Ren-1C gene in HEK cells. Previous studies showed that RB stimulated promoter activity through CREB/ATF and Sp-1 binding sites (27Kim S.-J. Wagner S. O'Reilly M.A. Lui F. Robbins P.D. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 331-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 28Kim S.-J. Onwuta U.S. Lee Y.I. Li R. Botchan M.R. Robbins P.D. Mol. Cell.

Colton L.A. Ryan S. Routes J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8082-8088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The RP-2 element has no apparent homology with CREB/ATF or Sp-1-binding sites. The CREB/ATF-binding site is known to confer cAMP-responsive transcriptional activity. We and others previously demonstrated that the RP-2 element and upstream CREB/ATF sites were involved in cAMP-mediated transcription of the mouse and human renin genes (45Tamura K. Umemura S.

Res. 1994; 74: 764-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the synthetic DNA containing the consensus binding site for CREB/ATF did not compete for RP-2 element binding, indicating that CREB/ATF family transcription factors did not participate in RB-mediated activation by the RP-2 element. Studies have demonstrated that RB can either positively or negatively regulate expression of several genes through cis-acting elements in a cell type-dependent manner (57Lee W.H. Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 752: 432-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). At present the exact mechanism by which RB activates transcription of the renin gene through the RP-2 element is unclear. RB may be directly involved in the binding activity of RP-2 element-binding factor through repression of transcription of a repressor protein or a protein that inhibits DNA binding, or through a direct and positive interaction with transcription factors (58Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). For example, RB stimulates Sp-1-mediated transcription of the c-jun gene by liberating Sp-1 from a Sp-1-negative regulator that specifically inhibits Sp-1 binding to a c-jun Sp-1 site (59Chen L.I. Nishinaka T. Kwan K. Kitabayashi I. Yokoyama K. Fu Y.H. Grunwald S. Chiu R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4380-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Although the negative regulatory element has not been identified in the RP-2 element, CREB/ATF and negative regulatory element-binding protein bind to the far upstream 5′-flanking region of the mouse renin genes (Ren-1D, −619 to −597; Ren-2, −670 to −648) (54Horiuchi M. Nakamura N. Tang S.-S. Barrett G. Dzau V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16247-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an interaction between these nuclear proteins is suggested to play a role in the tissue-specific regulation of renin gene transcription (55Horiuchi M. Pratt R.E. Nakamura N. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1805-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RB may also be indirectly involved in the binding activity of RP-2 element-binding factor. The arrest of cell cycle progression in G1 in response to the overexpression of RB may result in a post-transcriptional modification increasing transcription factor binding to the RP-2 element. Previous studies indicated binding of nuclear proteins from the pituitary cell line gonadocorticotrope to a region on the human renin promoter that is analogous to the RP-2 element, and suggested that transcription factors related to Pit-1/GH-1 could be responsible for binding to the RP-2-analogous element in the human renin gene (50Sun J.

Although originally identified as a Pit-1/GH-1-binding site, this sequence in the RP-2 element has only partial similarity to the Pit-1/GH-1 recognition sequence. In addition, Germain et al.(16Germain S. Konoshita T. Philippe J. Corvol P. Pinet F. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) examined the cis-acting elements of the proximal promoter involved in cAMP-induced human renin gene transcription using renin-producing chorionic cell and kidney cortex cell nuclear extracts. They showed that tissue-specific factors distinct from Pit-1/GH-1 specifically bound the RP-2-analogous element in the human renin gene. Furthermore, Petrovic et al. (17Petrovic N. Black T.A. Fabian J.R. Kane C. Jones C.A. Loudon J.A. Abonia J.P. Sigmund C.D. Gross K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22499-22505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) showed that the human Pit-1/GH-1 sequence did not form complexes with nuclear proteins from renal renin-expressing As4.1 cells nor was it able to compete with the nuclear binding activity in As4.1 cells to the RP-2 element. In this study, double-stranded synthetic DNA containing the consensus binding sites for Pit-1/GH-1 did not compete with the RP-2 element binding activity in HEK cells, supporting the suggestion that the RP-2 element-binding factor is distinct from the Pit-1/GH-1 family transcription factors. Although this factor may still belong to the POU homeodomain class family, its precise identity of the factor is unknown at present. The data presented here demonstrated that RB activates theRen-1C gene proximal promoter in HEK cells, and that this effect is mediated mainly via a proximal promoter element from −75 to −47 (RP-2 element) overlapping the TATA-like region. Transcription factors distinct from the CREB/ATF or Pit-1/GH-1 family appear to mediate this RB response, and nuclear factors binding to the RP-2 element seem to be regulated by RB in the activation process. RB-mediated modulation of promoter activity may have a role in the tissue-specific and developmentally linked regulation of renin gene expression. Further studies are obviously warranted to investigate the molecular relationship between RB and regulation of renin gene transcription in response to various stimuli."

A segment was deleted from a circular duplex DNA molecule by restriction at two sites. 3′ single-stranded overhangs were introduced at both ends of the remaining linear fragment. In a first step, RecA protein catalyzed the formation of a d-loop between one single-stranded tail and a homologous undeleted supercoiled DNA molecule. In a second step,E. coli DNA polymerase II or III used the 3′ end in thed-loop as a primer to copy the missing sequences of the linear substrate on one strand of the supercoiled template. Under proper conditions, the integrity of the deleted substrate was restored, as shown by analysis of the products by electrophoresis, restriction, and transformation.

In this reaction, DNA synthesis is strictly dependent on recombination, and repair is achieved without formation of a Holliday junction. Double-strand breaks in DNA result essentially from exposure of the cells to ionizing radiations or defective repair of clustered single-strand lesions. In yeast, they also occur spontaneously during meiosis, particularly at homologous recombination hot spots (1Orr-Weaver T.L. Szostak J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4417-4421Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In the absence of an efficient repair system, the introduction of a double-strand break in a chromosome constitutes a lethal event.In mammalian cells the repair of double-strand breaks seems to be predominantly achieved by nonconservative mechanisms such as direct strand rejoining (2Morris T. Thacker J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1392-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 3Phillips J.W. Morgan W.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5794-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) or single-strand annealing (4Lin F.L. Sperle K. Sternberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 10: 103-112Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar), whereas in yeast or bacteria, homologous recombination appears to be the major way to overcome double-strand breaks. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, most of the genes required for homologous recombination fall into the RAD52 epistatic group (5 and references therein). Mutations in these genes render cells sensitive to ionizing radiations (6Mortimer R.K. Rad. Res. 1958; 9: 3312-3316Crossref Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and to chemicals known to induce DNA breakage but do not significantly affect UV sensitivity. In bacteria, the repair of double-strand breaks is an inducible SOS function and requires the presence of another DNA duplex with the same base sequence as that of the broken helix (7Krasin F. Hutchinson F. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 81-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Rapidly growing Escherichia coli cells have multiple copies of most of their genome and exhibit increased resistance to killing by x-rays, showing that breaks are repaired efficiently (8Pollard E.C. Fluke D.J. Kazanis D. Mol. & Gen. Genet. 1981; 184: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The repair process is clearly conservative as the sequences of the participating DNA molecules are recovered.Several models have been proposed for the repair of double-strand breaks by homologous recombination (9Resnick M.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1976; 59: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 10Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J.

One 3′ end invades the donor duplex to form a d-loop and primes DNA synthesis on one strand of the duplex while the other strand is displaced. According to Szostak et al. (10Szostak J.W. Orr-Weaver T.L. Rothstein R.J. Cell. 1983; 33: 25-35Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar), as synthesis progresses, the displaced strand anneals to the noninvading 3′ ss end and is then used as template for repair synthesis, leading to the formation of two Holliday junctions. Resolution can occur with or without crossing over, and all products carry newly synthesized DNA. However, a number of genetic data obtained in a variety of organisms cannot be accounted for by a such a symmetrical mechanism. Belmaaza and Chartrand (12Belmaaza A. Chartrand P. Mutat. Res. 1994; 314: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) proposed an alternative model in which the newly synthesized strand is released from the d-loop and anneals to the noninvading 3′ ss tail. In this case, only one strand of the donor duplex serves as template for DNA synthesis, and repair occurs without formation of a Holliday junction. This mechanism is strongly reminiscent of a reaction that occurs in T4-infected cells, which converts recombination intermediates into replication forks (13Mosig G. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 54-82Google Scholar), and was substantiated by the biochemical studies of Formosa and Alberts (14Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The in vitro reaction was strictly dependent on (i) the presence of the UvsX and gene 32 proteins (the T4 equivalents ofE. coli RecA and SSB protein); (ii) T4 DNA polymerase and its accessory proteins; (iii) homologous ss and duplex DNA substrates, and was greatly stimulated by the T4 dda helicase.The enzymes used in the T4 in vitro system have functional equivalents in E. coli, and there is little doubt that precise repair of double-strand breaks requires the cooperation of recombination and replication. In this report, we describe the reconstitution of a repair reaction with a mixture of purified E. coli recombination and replication proteins. The results support a mechanism in which RecA protein promotes one-sided invasion of a duplex donor by a linear homologous DNA bearing 3′ ss overhangs. The invading end serves as a primer for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase II or III, which copy one strand of the duplex template. Repair is achieved without formation of a Holliday junction.RESULTSThe strategy developed to test for recombination-dependent repair is illustrated in Figs.1 and 2. The major difference between phage M13 wt and its derivative M13mp19 is the lac insert carried by the latter. In addition, the BamHI site at nucleotide 2220 in M13 wt has been moved to nucleotide 6264 in M13mp19 (Fig. 1). Treatment of M13mp19 RF I with XmnI produces two fragments of 4961 and 2288 bp (Fig. 2 A, a andb). The smaller fragment was discarded and the larger fragment subjected to controlled treatment with λ exonuclease, an enzyme specific for the 5′ ends of duplex DNA. Thus, 3′ ss tails were introduced on both strands of this fragment (Fig. 2 A,c). We expected that in the presence of RecA, 3′ ss tails would invade supercoiled M13 wt RF I DNA to form a d-loop (23Shibata T. Das Gupta C. Cunningham R.P. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and that the invading end would serve as a primer for DNA synthesis on the intact M13 wt template (Fig. 2 A,d). If this were the case, elongation of the newly synthesized strand might provide a complete copy of the 2288-bp fragment, which, except for a single nucleotide change, is identical in M13 and M13mp19. In principle, if no Holliday junction is formed, displacement or unwinding of the elongated strand from its template and annealing to the noninvading 3′ ss tail may lead to conservative repair of the deleted M13mp19 DNA (Fig. 2 B, b1,b2, and b3). Alternatively, if synthesis takes place on both strands of the donor duplex, resolution will be needed to release the repaired products.Figure 1Partial restriction map of M13 wt and M13mp19.

In each case, the expected result of strand displacement and, when applicable, annealing to the noninvading 3′ ss tail are shown in a2, b2, and c2. In contrast witha2, the intermediates in b2 and c2 can in principle sustain repair synthesis and ligation, leading to the formation of b3 and c3.

See “Results” for more details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Formation and Structure of Joint MoleculesTo determine the requirements for optimal formation of joint molecules, we used a32P-labeled M13mp19 large XmnI fragment with 3′ ss tails. Analysis by electrophoresis showed that the formation and yield of joint molecules depended on several factors (Fig.3). As expected, the reaction required the presence of RecA, SSB, and ATP or ATPγS (adenosine 5′-O-thiotriphosphate), as well as homology between the linear substrate and the circular template (no joint molecules were formed if M13 wt RF I was replaced by φX174 RF I). Superhelicity of the template was also required, since either relaxation with topoisomerase I or nicking of the template (not shown) with gpII protein, the product of M13 gene II (24Greenstein D. Horiuchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 197: 157-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), considerably lowered the yield of joint molecules. In addition, the reaction was strictly dependent on the presence of 3′ ss tails on the linear substrate, as the undigested fragment (not shown) or the fragment carrying 5′ ss tails originating from digestion of the 4961-bp XmnI fragment with exonuclease III did not produce joint molecules. This is consistent with the 5′ to 3′ polarity of the binding of RecA to ssDNA (25Register III, J.C. Griffith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12308-12312Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Cassuto E. Howard-Flanders P.

Lane 10, no ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Aside from these absolute requirements, the yield of joint molecules was strongly influenced by the total concentration of DNA and proteins and by the relative concentration of the substrates. The length of the ss tails seemed to have no effect within the available range (250–700 nucleotides), nor did the addition of DNA gyrase. Under the optimal conditions described under “Materials and Methods,” a substantial fraction of the input radioactivity was found in joint molecules (Fig.3, lane 4).Joint molecules were analyzed by electron microscopy after removal of free proteins. Out of several hundred DNA molecules examined, close to 30% of the linear molecules were joined to circular molecules, whereas no joint molecules were found in controls lacking RecA. As expected, all joint molecules resulted from one-sided invasion of the M13 wt template (see Fig. 4 for representative examples), since RecA-promoted invasion of a supercoiled DNA molecule by ssDNA induces unwinding of the duplex (28Cunningham R.P. Shibata T. Das Gupta C. Radding C.M. Nature. 1979; 281: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), thus preventing invasion at another site. Most ss tails were covered by RecA, but the coverage appeared to be somewhat irregular, possibly because of the presence of ATP (instead of ATPγS) in the reaction (29Egelman E.H. Stasiak A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 677-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).Figure 4Electron microscopic visualization of joint molecules.

With Pol II and Pol III, no incorporation was observed with either substrate in the presence of RecA, although traces of radioactivity, supposedly due to self-priming, could be detected in the absence of RecA at the position of the linear substrate. However, in controls with Pol I, incorporation probably due to nick translation and/or strand displacement produced species migrating from the original positions of the substrates to the position of joint molecules and above. To minimize such events in further experiments with Pol I, joint molecules made with a3H-labeled large XmnI fragment with 3′ ss tails were purified as described under “Materials and Methods.” This step completely removed the free linear substrate, but a substantial amount of M13 RFI was still present in the preparation.The ability of the invading 3′ ss tails to serve as primers for DNA synthesis was tested with the three DNA polymerases in the presence or absence of gyrase and helicase II (UvrD). T4 DNA ligase was present in all reactions, as were RecA and SSB, the former to favor annealing of potential complementary single strands, the latter because it stimulates Pol II and Pol III activity. Analysis of the products on agarose gels showed that with all three polymerases, radioactivity was found at the position of joint molecules after 5 min of incubation (Fig. 5, top lanes). With Pol I, however, incorporation also took place at and above the position of the starting substrates (lanes a–c), as observed in the controls. After a 30-min incubation (Fig. 5, bottom lanes), radioactivity at the position of joint molecules decreased in reactions with Pol II and Pol III (but not with Pol I), and a fraction of the incorporated label was found at the position of M13mp19 RF II DNA. In the presence of gyrase, radioactivity was also found at the position of M13mp19 RF I DNA. Gyrase or UvrD stimulated the formation of M13mp19-like species, but stimulation was not increased when both proteins were present in the same reaction.Since M13mp19-like species could also result from contamination of any of the enzymes used in these experiments by an activity capable of resolving Holliday junctions, we incubated a synthetic junction with Pol II with or without UvrD or gyrase and with Pol III, under the exact conditions used for invasion-primed synthesis. As a positive control, the synthetic junction was also incubated with T4 endonuclease VII (21Shah R. Bennett R.J. West S.C.

Bands at the position indicated by the RF I and RF II markers were cut out and the DNA electroeluted and cleaved with XmnI orBamHI. The former enzyme should produce two bands from M13mp19 DNA, the invading 4961-bp fragment and the 2288-bp fragment originally deleted (Figs. 1 and 2). These fragments were observed in all cases (Fig. 7, lanes e–h).Figure 7Restriction analysis of the products of invasion-primed DNA synthesis catalyzed by Pol II and Pol III.

Since the newly acquired 2288-bp fragment of M13mp19 must be a copy of the corresponding fragment in M13, repaired M13mp19 molecules should carry two BamHI sites, and cleavage at both sites should yield two fragments of 4044 and 3205 bp. Again, the expected fragments were seen in all cases (Fig. 7, lanes a–d), confirming the structure of the “repaired” RF I and RF II species. In all digests (lanes a–h), the higher radioactivity in the smaller fragment indicates that synthesis occurred predominantly in the originally deleted region of the M13mp19 chromosome, as expected from the model in Fig. 2 B.TransformationReconstitution in vitro of viable M13mp19 phage from the large XmnI fragment and M13 wt DNA was also examined by a transformation test. M13mp19 can be identified by its ability to perform α-complementation in alacI q lacZΔM15 host and to form blue plaques in the presence of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-D-galactopyranoside and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, whereas M13 wt will form colorless plaques (22Langley K.E.

A. 1975; 72: 1254-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar).Primed synthesis reactions (scaled up to a total volume of 50 μl) were carried out with Pol I, II, and III, with and without gyrase or UvrD and electrophoresed on agarose gel alongside M13mp19 RF I and RF II markers. Bands at the positions indicated by the markers were excised and the DNA eluted by a modification of the freeze-squeeze method (31Thuring R.W. Sanders J.B. Borst P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 66: 213-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and introduced into competent JM109 (recA) cells as described under “Materials and Methods.” 93 to 97% of the total number of plaques (several hundred) issued from Pol II and Pol III reactions were blue. No blue plaques were seen for reactions with Pol I or when the cells were transformed with a mixture of the starting substrates incubated without RecA (Table I).Table IYield of repaired DNARF I bandRF II band%Pol I0Pol I +Gyrase00Pol I +UvrD0Pol II12Pol II +Gyrase413Pol II +UvrD23Pol III6Pol III +Gyrase29Pol III +UvrD13The yield was estimated on the basis of the following considerations. One joint molecule can produce at best one molecule of M13mp19 (size 7.25 kilobase pairs), or 64% of input (w/w). As the primed synthesis reactions contained 80 ng of joint molecules, 100% repair would yield 51 ng of M13mp19 DNA. In preliminary experiments, we found that recovery of elution of M13mp19 RF I or RF II DNA from excised gel bands was close to 40% and that after phenol extraction, ethanol precipitation, and dialysis, the transformation frequency of the eluted DNA was 8 × 104 plaque-forming units/mg in strain JM 109 (recA). Therefore 100% repair would correspond approximately to 20 ng of M13mp19 DNA or 1.6 × 103plaque-forming units. Results are the number of observed blue plaques/number expected for complete repair of joint molecules. Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we describe a recombination-dependentin vitro system for repair of double-strand breaks. In a first step, RecA promoted the formation of joint molecules between a covalently closed duplex DNA donor and a deleted linear homologous substrate bearing 3′ ss tails, one of which invaded the donor DNA. In a second step, Pol II and Pol III used the invading end as a primer to copy the deleted sequences on one strand of the template.As seen in Fig. 2 B, the precision of the repair process should depend on the extent of DNA polymerization. Complete repair can only occur if the end of the newly synthesized strand is complementary (and therefore can anneal) to sequences contained in the noninvading ss tail of the linear substrate (b2). In such a case, repair synthesis and ligase must carry out the final steps (b3). If invasion-primed synthesis does not proceed far enough (a1), the product will correspond to the original linear substrate with one extended ss tail (a2). If, on the contrary, primed synthesis proceeds past the noninvading ss tail, the product will be an open duplex circle with an extra whisker (c3).Analysis of the results of primed synthesis (Fig. 5) indicates that the three kinds of products may be formed. Only the DNA species migrating at the position of M13mp19 RF I in the presence of gyrase reflect complete repair. Ligase and gyrase were present in sufficient concentration to close and supercoil an amount of nicked M13 DNA corresponding to several times the amount of DNA in the reaction mixtures, as determined in preliminary assays. We therefore assume that the M13mp19 RF II-like species that are refractory to ligation, hence to supercoiling, correspond to duplex circles with short ss gaps and/or ss tails (Fig. 2 B, b2, c2, andc3). It should be noted that species with long whiskers, which would migrate well above the M13mp19 RF II marker, will not be taken into account in this assay. Smears (or even bands) between the RF I and RF II markers seem to be produced by displacement from the joint molecules of newly synthesized strands too short to anneal to the noninvading ss tail. Radioactivity at and above the position of joint molecules is likely to reflect synthesis in progress or displacement failure.The results of restriction analysis and transformation experiments confirm the general structure of the repaired DNA but do not guarantee that the newly synthesized strand is a perfect copy of its template. The region deleted in the starting linear substrate is essential for phage viability. Gross rearrangements during invasion-primed synthesis would interfere with the life cycle of the phage and are therefore unlikely. But mismatches, for example, would not be detected by restriction analysis and would be eliminated in the cells upon transformation, as would other errors that can be repaired in the absence of RecA. Imperfect products, such as circles with short tails or gaps, could easily be trimmed or filled in the cells and produce viable phage.In vivo, repair synthesis is thought to be carried out by Pol I or Pol III, depending on the size of the repair patch, and in some cases by Pol II (32Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co, New York1992: 113-169Google Scholar). In the present experiments, the results obtained with Pol I are open to several interpretations: the label found around the position of joint molecules could result from primed synthesis without release of the new strand, but also reflects incorporation at nicks, as observed in the controls. Moreover, because of its low processivity and accessory degradative activities, Pol I could also produce new strands too short to anneal to the noninvading 3′ ss tail. Whatever the reason, M13mp19-like forms were never detected in our experiments with Pol I, which confirms that the RF I and RF II species obtained with Pol II and Pol III are not due to nick translation or strand displacement. In addition, the results in Fig. 6eliminate a potential contamination by a Holliday junction resolvase. The activities of Pol II and Pol III in the repair of double-strand breaks are similar, although the former is apparently more efficient. Whether these differences among the three polymerases hold truein vivo remains to be determined.Both UvrD and gyrase increased the yield of M13mp19-like structures but do not seem to act in a concerted or cooperative way since stimulation by either protein was not improved by the addition of the other. The effect of UvrD is reminiscent of that of the T4 dda helicase which stimulates recombination-dependent DNA synthesis in vitro (14Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both dda and UvrD are known to stimulate, respectively, UvsX- and RecA-promoted strand exchange (16Morel P. Hejna J.A. Ehrlich S.D. Cassuto E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3205-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,33Kodadek T. Alberts B.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9712-9718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and neither has been shown to play a direct role in replication. However, UvrD does stimulate DNA synthesis by Pol III at an artificial replication fork (35Kuhn B. Abdel-Monem M. Eur. J. Bioche"
