https://openalex.org/W2160049657,"A method for study of mechanisms of twin and translation gliding in minerals in rocks has been devised by which slip markings produced experimentally on polished surfaces are related to crystallographic planes by universal stage measurements of the crystal orientations. In specimens strained 5 to 10 percent at 5 to 7 kilobars confining pressure and 700 degrees to 850 degrees C, the glide plane and glide direction for slip and twinning have been determined in olivine, enstatite, kyanite, and diopside. Slip occurs in closest-packed directions, in which also lies the shortest Burgers vector of a unit edge dislocation in the slip plane."

https://openalex.org/W2058452807,"trans-Aconitate ion, an inhibitor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, was identified in range grasses as trans-aconitic acid, which was isolated in crystalline form. It occurs in surprisingly high concentrations in early-season forage grasses. Dry-weight concentrations of trans-aconitate vary with season and species; concentrations of between I and 2.5 percent are common in mixed pasture grasses, but are higher in certain species such as Hordeum leporinum (3.5 percent) and Phalaris tuberosa var. stenoptera (4.2 percent). Leaves of western larkspur (Delphinium hesperium) contain 12.2 percent trans-aconitate. trans-Aconitate may be partially responsible for nutritional disorders, such as grass tetany (hypomagnesemia), that occur in grazing cattle in early spring."
https://openalex.org/W2095435069,"Much of what needs to be changed in U.S. industry involves close ties to manufacturing, design for manufacturability, a rapid design cycle, and up-to-date technical knowledge on the part of the engineers themselves. Being up-to-date requires conscious company effort. Traveling to meetings, reading the technical literature, and being a part of the engineering community are necessities if we are to compete with others who make these efforts and are thus better able to incorporate technical change rapidly into their own products."
https://openalex.org/W1986227408,"Distribution of magnesium and strontium was determined between waters and calcites secreted by the oyster species Crassostrea virginica and C. rhizophorae in natural habitats at eight localities, from Maine to Puerto Rico. The concentration of strontium in the calcite shells increases with increasing temperature in the range 13° to 25°C, and also with increasing Sr++/Ca++ molal ratio in the water. The concentration of magnesium in the shells increases irregularly with temperature, and it is apparently independent of the Mg++/Ca++ ratio in the water. The greater variation with temperature in the distribution factor for magnesium may be related to genetic differences between semi-isolated populations."
https://openalex.org/W2036818584,Quantitative analyses of global diversity in the marine fossil record over Phanerozoic time reveal an historically ordered pattern of sequential dominance and increasing diversity. Explanatory models applied to this empirical pattern lead to irreconcilable differences of interpretation. The issue may be resolved by determining the expected distributions and limits of temporal covariation among clades generated by a random branching process. Results also challenge the claim that asymmetries in intra-clade diversity variation provide a directional arrow for the history of life.

https://openalex.org/W1989559188,"The structures of hexaazaoctadecahydrocoronene, [HAOC](n) (n = O, + 2), have been determined by single-crystal x-ray diffraction. Although HAOC is aromatic, its dication has a localized structure that is based upon Jahn-Teller-distorted cyanine/p-phenylenediammonium fragments. The structure is consistent with the singlet ground state as determined by magnetic susceptibility and contrasts with the simplest Hückel expectation of a triplet ground state."
https://openalex.org/W2081575711,"The malting barley-producing regions in Montana and Canada are threatened with a new virus-like barley disease that appears to be etiologically novel. Ultrathin sections of diseased tissue contained enveloped, filamentous virus-like particles that measured 64 nanometers by 126 to 4000 nanometers. These lengths are unique for plant viruses. Unexpectedly, the spider mite,Petrobia latens, which has never been reported to be a vector of a pathogen, was found to transmit the causal agent from diseased plants to healthy barley, while noninfective mites failed to do so unless they were allowed prior access to diseased tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2011153141,"A review of research on low heat rejection engines, on cooperative efforts in the United States and abroad to incorporate ceramics in intermittent combustion engines, and on the use of ceramics in these engines is presented. The reduction of heat loss from the combustion chamber of diesel engines improves fuel efficiency only 3 or 4 percent. Some other gains may be possible from a smaller cooling system, recovery of exhaust energy, and improvements in aerodynamics. It is judged that designs of low heat rejection engines will have the greatest initial impact on armored combat vehicles. Organization, coordination, planning, and cooperation on R&D for the use of ceramics in intermittent combustion engines appear to be greater abroad than in the United States."

https://openalex.org/W2061954130,"A diverse range of physical phenomena, both observed and hypothetical, are described by topological solutions to nonlinear gauge field theories. Computer-generated color graphic displays can provide a clear and detailed representation of some of these solutions, which might otherwise be physically unintelligible because of their mathematical complexity. Graphical representations are presented here for two topological solutions: (i) the solutions of a model that represents the filaments of quantized magnetic flux in a superconductor, and (ii) the solutions of an SO(3) gauge theory corresponding to a pair of separated magnetic monopoles. An introduction is provided to the gauge field theories giving rise to these solutions."

https://openalex.org/W2058983017,"The basement complex of the Robert Scott Glacier area, Queen Maud Range, Antarctica, consists of a complex suite of metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks intruded by light gray biotite granite. Brown biotite from a granite at Mount Wilbur was dated by the potassium-argon method at 470 +/- 14 million years; this age coincides closely with many other ages from granitic rocks in the Transantarctic Mountains."
