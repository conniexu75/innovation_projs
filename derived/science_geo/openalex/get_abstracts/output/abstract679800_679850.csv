Khan et al. , Knapmeyer-Endrun et al. , and Stähler et al. used recently detected marsquakes from the seismometer deployed during the InSight mission to map the interior of Mars (see the Perspective by Cottaar and Koelemeijer). Mars likely has a 24- to 72-kilometer-thick crust with a very deep lithosphere close to 500 kilometers. Similar to the Earth, a low-velocity layer probably exists beneath the lithosphere. The crust of Mars is likely highly enriched in radioactive elements that help to heat this layer at the expense of the interior. The core of Mars is liquid and large, ∼1830 kilometers, which means that the mantle has only one rocky layer rather than two like the Earth has. These results provide a preliminary structure of Mars that helps to constrain the different theories explaining the chemistry and internal dynamics of the planet.

Zhou et al. report a template-free hydrothermal synthesis of the one-dimensional channel zeolite mordenite, in which some silicon was replaced by iron. Rather than forming a powder that requires further shaping, this mechanically stable material self-assembled into monoliths. Iron atoms bound in tetrahedral zeolite sites narrowed the channels and enabled the size-exclusion separation of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) over nitrogen (N 2 ) and methane. High CO 2 uptake and highly efficient CO 2 –N 2 separation was demonstrated for both dry and humid conditions. Science , aax5776, this issue p. 315"

Yang et al. developed a method for making high-quality crystalline thin films of piezoelectric γ-glycine crystals that are grown and refined between layers of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (see the Perspective by Berger). The PVA layers are essential to promoting the crystallization of the preferred crystal phase with the polar axis oriented perpendicular to the film plan because of hydrogen bonding at the PVA-glycine interface. The thin films show a macroscopic piezoelectric response and high stability in aqueous environments. The films are water soluble and, when suitably packaged, could be implanted into a biodegradable energy-harvesting device. Science , abf2155, this issue p. 337 ; see also abj0424, p. 278"

https://openalex.org/W3180433600,"Reconstituting the ovarian follicle Recent advances have enabled the generation of oocytes from pluripotent stem cells in vitro. However, these cells require a somatic environment to develop fully as reproductive cells. Yoshino et al. applied what is known about differentiation processes in vivo to determine a culture condition to differentiate embryonic stem cells into gonadal somatic cell–like cells (see the Perspective by Yang and Ng). When the embryonic stem cell–generated ovarian gonadal tissue was combined with early primordial germ cells or in vitro–derived primordial germ cell–like cells, germ cells developed into viable oocytes within the reconstituted follicles that could be fertilized and result in viable offspring. This system enables an alternative method for mouse gamete production and advances our understanding of mammalian reproduction and development.

https://openalex.org/W3184077971,"Intestinal HDL is hepatoprotective High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is important for cholesterol metabolism and may have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. Although HDL is mainly produced by the liver, the intestine is also a source. Han et al. show in mice that intestinal HDL is not routed to the systemic circulation. Rather, in the form of HDL3, it is directly transported to the liver through the hepatic portal vein. There, it sequesters bacterial lipopolysaccharide from the gut that can trigger inflammation and liver damage. In various models of liver injury, loss of enteric HDL exacerbated pathology. By contrast, drugs elevating intestinal HDL improved disease outcomes. HDL3 is enriched in human portal venous blood, suggesting that enteric HDL may be targetable for the treatment of liver disease.

Using a high-throughput platform, Markin et al. expressed, purified, and performed an array of kinetic measurements on a target esterase, collecting data from &gt;1000 mutations spanning the entire protein (see the Perspective by Baumer and Whitehead). Protein misfolding into an inactive state, rather than decreased equilibrium stability, was a crucial factor in negatively affected variants spread throughout the protein. When combined with prior mechanistic understanding and structures, four “functional components” help to rationalize the otherwise complex spatial pattern of effects of mutations on different aspects of enzyme function, all of which would be invisible from mutagenesis of just a few residues.

https://openalex.org/W3195965567,"Somatic mutations that accumulate in normal tissues are associated with ageing and disease1,2. Here we performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of 1,737 morphologically normal tissue biopsies of 9 organs from 5 donors. We found that somatic mutation accumulations and clonal expansions were widespread, although to variable extents, in morphologically normal human tissues. Somatic copy number alterations were rarely detected, except for in tissues from the oesophagus and cardia. Endogenous mutational processes with the SBS1 and SBS5 mutational signatures are ubiquitous among normal tissues, although they exhibit different relative activities. Exogenous mutational processes operate in multiple tissues from the same donor. We reconstructed the spatial somatic clonal architecture with sub-millimetre resolution. In the oesophagus and cardia, macroscopic somatic clones that expanded to hundreds of micrometres were frequently seen, whereas in tissues such as the colon, rectum and duodenum, somatic clones were microscopic in size and evolved independently, possibly restricted by local tissue microstructures. Our study depicts a body map of somatic mutations and clonal expansions from the same individual. Laser-capture microdissection and mini-bulk exome sequencing are combined to analyse somatic mutations in morphologically normal tissues from nine organs from five donors, revealing variation in mutation burdens, mutational signatures and clonal expansions."

https://openalex.org/W3182925168,"Conserved spatial memory mechanisms Food-caching birds are memory specialists that can remember thousands of hidden food items. Using electrophysiological recordings from freely behaving birds, Payne et al. analyzed neuronal activity in the likely hippocampus homolog of two bird species, the tufted titmouse and the zebra finch. They chose these two species to compare, respectively, birds that do and do not display food-caching behavior. Place cells and typical hippocampal firing patterns that resembled rodent neuronal activity could be detected in the extreme memory specialists. Compared with titmice, however, spatial activity was noticeably weaker and less abundant in zebra finches. These findings provide evidence that the neural processes underlying spatial memory are remarkably conserved across widely divergent hippocampal circuits separated by millions of years of evolution.

https://openalex.org/W3184940100,"Two promising architectures for solid-state quantum information processing are electron spins in semiconductor quantum dots and the collective electromagnetic modes of superconducting circuits. In some aspects, these two platforms are dual to one another: superconducting qubits are more easily coupled but are relatively large among quantum devices $(\sim\mathrm{mm})$, while electrostatically-confined electron spins are spatially compact ($\sim \mathrm{\mu m}$) but more complex to link. Here we combine beneficial aspects of both platforms in the Andreev spin qubit: the spin degree of freedom of an electronic quasiparticle trapped in the supercurrent-carrying Andreev levels of a Josephson semiconductor nanowire. We demonstrate coherent spin manipulation by combining single-shot circuit-QED readout and spin-flipping Raman transitions, finding a spin-flip time $T_S = 17~\mathrm{\mu s}$ and a spin coherence time $T_{2E}=52~\mathrm{ns}$. These results herald a new spin qubit with supercurrent-based circuit-QED integration and further our understanding and control of Andreev levels -- the parent states of Majorana zero modes -- in semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures."

Bhunia et al. found that both of these abilities could be achieved in piezoelectric molecular crystals, specifically bipyrazole organic crystals. When the crystals are fractured, they develop charged surfaces that attract each other, drawing the two faces together to enable self-repair as long as they remain within a critical distance of each other. The effect can also be seen in other noncentrosymmetric piezoelectric crystals. Science , abg3886, this issue p. 321"
https://openalex.org/W3194054041,"Cellular dynamics and fate decision in early human embryogenesis remain largely unknown owing to the challenges of performing studies in human embryos1. Here, we explored whole-genomes of 334 single-cell colonies and targeted deep sequences of 379 bulk tissues obtained from various anatomical locations of seven recently deceased adult human donors. Using somatic mutations as an intrinsic barcode, we reconstructed early cellular phylogenies that demonstrate (1) an endogenous mutational rate that is higher in the first cell division but decreases to approximately one per cell per cell division later in life; (2) universal unequal contribution of early cells to embryo proper, resulting from early cellular bottlenecks that stochastically set aside epiblast cells within the embryo; (3) examples of varying degrees of early clonal imbalances between tissues on the left and right sides of the body, different germ layers and specific anatomical parts and organs; (4) emergence of a few ancestral cells that will substantially contribute to adult cell pools in blood and liver; and (5) presence of mitochondrial DNA heteroplasmy in the fertilized egg. Our approach also provides insights into the age-related mutational processes and loss of sex chromosomes in normal somatic cells. In sum, this study provides a foundation for future studies to complete cellular phylogenies in human embryogenesis. Adult human tissues from diverse sites around the body are used to reconstruct cellular phylogenies from early development, using somatic mutations as an internal barcode."
https://openalex.org/W3178902255,"Germinal centers (GCs) are the site of immunoglobulin somatic hypermutation and affinity maturation, processes essential to an effective antibody response. The formation of GCs has been studied in detail, but less is known about what leads to their regression and eventual termination, factors that ultimately limit the extent to which antibodies mature within a single reaction. We show that contraction of immunization-induced GCs is immediately preceded by an acute surge in GC-resident Foxp3+ T cells, attributed at least partly to up-regulation of the transcription factor Foxp3 by T follicular helper (TFH) cells. Ectopic expression of Foxp3 in TFH cells is sufficient to decrease GC size, implicating the natural up-regulation of Foxp3 by TFH cells as a potential regulator of GC lifetimes."

However, current catalysts tend to deactivate too quickly for practical use. Snyder et al. investigated the deactivation mechanism using Mössbauer and Raman spectroscopy and accompanying simulations (see the Perspective by Scott). Their results suggest that in zeolites with large apertures, after iron active sites strip hydrogen from methane, the resulting methyl radicals can leak away and deactivate other iron centers. Zeolites with tighter apertures can keep the radicals nearby longer, favoring the formation of methanol. Science , abd5803, this issue p. 327 ; see also abj4734, p. 277"

However, the specific chromatin features that govern their nucleosome binding and remodeling activities remain unknown. We subjected endogenously purified mSWI/SNF complexes and their constituent assembly modules to a diverse library of DNA-barcoded mononucleosomes, performing more than 25,000 binding and remodeling measurements. Here, we define histone modification-, variant-, and mutation-specific effects, alone and in combination, on mSWI/SNF activities and chromatin interactions. Further, we identify the combinatorial contributions of complex module components, reader domains, and nucleosome engagement properties to the localization of complexes to selectively permissive chromatin states. These findings uncover principles that shape the genomic binding and activity of a major chromatin remodeler complex family."

Ultrafast optical studies of this insulator-to-metal transition indicate that it is mediated by the formation of a transient metallic phase that retains the structure of the original insulating phase. Sood et al. show that a similar sequence occurs when the material is electrically excited with a series of voltage pulses. Using ultrafast electron diffraction, the researchers monitored the structure of a vanadium dioxide sample after excitation and found evidence of a metastable metallic phase that appears during the transition.

Flat nanoplates retained the anion lattice and formed cobalt sulfide, but tall nanorods transformed into Co 9 S 8 nanocrystals with a cubic, close-packed structure.

How IFN-γ confers this function in nonimmune cells and tissues is poorly understood. Gaudet et al. used genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to identify apolipoprotein L-3 (APOL3) as an IFN-γ–induced bactericidal protein that protects human epithelium, endothelium, and fibroblasts against infection (see the Perspective by Nathan). APOL3 directly targets bacteria in the host cell cytosol and kills them by dissolving their anionic membranes into lipoprotein complexes.

https://openalex.org/W3185307340,"The ability to perceive and respond to environmental stimuli emerges in the absence of sensory experience. Spontaneous retinal activity prior to eye opening guides the refinement of retinotopy and eye-specific segregation in mammals, but its role in the development of higher-order visual response properties remains unclear. Here, we describe a transient window in neonatal mouse development during which the spatial propagation of spontaneous retinal waves resembles the optic flow pattern generated by forward self-motion. We show that wave directionality requires the same circuit components that form the adult direction-selective retinal circuit and that chronic disruption of wave directionality alters the development of direction-selective responses of superior colliculus neurons. These data demonstrate how the developing visual system patterns spontaneous activity to simulate ethologically relevant features of the external world and thereby instruct self-organization."

Whether such an intergenerational system occurs in other species is harder to demonstrate. Ilany et al. looked at nearly 30 years of social interaction data in spotted hyenas, a female-dominated system with a highly structured society, and found that status inheritance is just as prominent (see the Perspective by Firth and Sheldon). Juvenile hyenas had social associations that were similar to their mothers, and the strength of the association was higher for higher-status mothers. Importantly, survival was associated with social inheritance, suggesting that these social roles are essential to hyena life. Science , abc1966, this issue p. 348 ; see also abj5234, p. 274"

We describe a putative case of the development of a cultural adaptation to urban environments: opening of household waste bins by wild sulphur-crested cockatoos. A spatial network analysis of community science reports revealed the geographic spread of bin opening from three suburbs to 44 in Sydney, Australia, by means of social learning. Analysis of 160 direct observations revealed individual styles and site-specific differences. We describe a full pathway from the spread of innovation to emergence of geographic variation, evidencing foraging cultures in parrots and indicating the existence of cultural complexity in parrots. Bin opening is directly linked to human-provided opportunities, highlighting the potential for culture to facilitate behavioral responses to anthropogenic change."
https://openalex.org/W3195878610,"Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease causes heart attacks and strokes, which are the leading causes of mortality worldwide1. The formation of atherosclerotic plaques is initiated when low-density lipoproteins bind to heparan-sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs)2 and become trapped in the subendothelial space of large and medium size arteries, which leads to chronic inflammation and remodelling of the artery wall2. A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) is a cytokine that binds to HSPGs3, but the physiology of this interaction is largely unknown. Here we show that genetic ablation or antibody-mediated depletion of APRIL aggravates atherosclerosis in mice. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that APRIL confers atheroprotection by binding to heparan sulfate chains of heparan-sulfate proteoglycan 2 (HSPG2), which limits the retention of low-density lipoproteins, accumulation of macrophages and formation of necrotic cores. Indeed, antibody-mediated depletion of APRIL in mice expressing heparan sulfate-deficient HSPG2 had no effect on the development of atherosclerosis. Treatment with a specific anti-APRIL antibody that promotes the binding of APRIL to HSPGs reduced experimental atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the serum levels of a form of human APRIL protein that binds to HSPGs, which we termed non-canonical APRIL (nc-APRIL), are associated independently of traditional risk factors with long-term cardiovascular mortality in patients with atherosclerosis. Our data reveal properties of APRIL that have broad pathophysiological implications for vascular homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W3195423481,"Background Previous research demonstrated a relationship between ON and disordered eating symptoms (eating concern, restraint, cognitive preoccupations about body shape and weight) and disordered eating attitudes (DEA). Since screening for orthorexia nervosa is now part of clinical practice, the measurement instruments to be used must be clinically significant, reliable, valid and sensitive to our target population. The main objective of the present study was to confirm the factor structure of the Arabic version of the ORTO-R using a first sample of Lebanese adults and confirm those results on another sample. The secondary objective was to assess sex differences in terms of ON and DEA, as well as to examine whether symptoms of ON were related to DEA in Lebanese adults. Methods A total of 783 Lebanese adults was selected to participate in this cross-sectional study (January-May 2018) using a proportionate random sample from all Lebanese governorates. Results The mean age of the total sample was 27.78 ± 11.60 years (Min. 18 –Max. 84) (33.5% females) and their mean BMI was 24.36 ± 5.31 kg/m 2 . All items of the ORTO-R were extracted during the factor analysis and yielded a two-factor solution with Eigenvalues &gt; 1 (variance explained = 50.07%; KMO = 0.570; Bartlett’s sphericity test p &lt;0.001; α Cronbach = 0.755). This factor structure was confirmed by a confirmatory factor analysis; the Maximum Likelihood Chi-Square = 26.894 and Degrees of Freedom = 8, which gave a χ2/df = 3.36. The Tucker Lewis Index (TLI) value was 0.914, whereas the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) value was 0.032. The root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) value was 0.077 [95% CI 0.046–0.111] (pclose = 0.07) and comparative fit index (CFI) value was 0.967 respectively, indicating a good fit of the model. There was also no measurement invariance between genders. Female gender was significantly associated with lower ORTO-R scores (more orthorexia nervosa) compared to males (B = -0.65; p = 0.026, 95% CI -1.22- -0.08; ɳ 2 = 0.006). However, no significant difference was found between genders in terms of EAT-26 scores (B = 0.23; p = 0.813, 95% CI -1.66–2.12; ɳ 2 = 0.0001). Higher ORTO-R scores (lower/ less pathological ON tendencies and behaviors) were significantly related to higher EAT-26 total scores (higher levels of DEA) as well as higher dieting, bulimia and oral control scores in both females (from a weak to a moderate positive correlation) and males (a weak positive correlation). Conclusion This cross-sectional population-based study confirmed the factor structure of the Arabic version of the ORTO-R, demonstrated an association between ON and DEA and revealed more ON among females compared to males."

https://openalex.org/W3195730313,"In the Arab countries, there has not been yet a specific validated Arabic questionnaire that can assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among the general population. This study, therefore, aimed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate the 5C scale into the Arabic language.The 5C scale was translated into Arabic by two independent bilingual co-authors, and then translated back into English. After reconciling translation disparities, the final Arabic questionnaire was disseminated into four randomly selected Arabic countries (Egypt, Libya, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Saudi Arabia). Data from 350 Arabic speaking adults (aged ≥18 years) were included in the final analysis. Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha. Construct validity was determined by concurrent, convergent, discriminant, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses.Age of participants ranged between 18 to 73 years; 57.14% were females, 37.43% from Egypt, 36.86%, from UAE, 30% were healthcare workers, and 42.8% had the intention to get COVID-19 vaccines. The 5 sub-scales of the questionnaire met the criterion of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha ≥0.7). The predictors of intention to get COVID-19 vaccines (concurrent validity) were young age and the 5C sub-scales. Convergent validity was identified by the significant inter-item and item-mean score of the sub-scale correlation (P<0.001). Discriminant validity was reported as inter-factor correlation matrix (<0.7). Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin sampling adequacy measure was 0.80 and Bartlett's sphericity test was highly significant (P<0.001). Exploratory factor analysis indicated that the 15 items of the questionnaire could be summarized into five factors. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the hypothesized five-factor model of the 15-item questionnaire was satisfied with adequate psychometric properties and fit with observed data (RMSEA = 0.060, GFI = 0.924, CFI = 0.957, TLI = 0.937, SRMR = 0.076 & NFI = 906).The Arabic version of the 5C scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess the psychological antecedents of COVID-19 vaccine among Arab population."
https://openalex.org/W3194915906,"COVID-19 is often characterized by dysregulated inflammatory and immune responses. It has been shown that the Traditional Chinese Medicine formulation Qing-Fei-Pai-Du decoction (QFPDD) is effective in the treatment of the disease, especially for patients in the early stage. Our network pharmacology analyses indicated that many inflammation and immune-related molecules were the targets of the active components of QFPDD, which propelled us to examine the effects of the decoction on inflammation. We found in the present study that QFPDD effectively alleviated dextran sulfate sodium-induced intestinal inflammation in mice. It inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNFα, and promoted the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by macrophagic cells. Further investigations found that QFPDD and one of its active components wogonoside markedly reduced LPS-stimulated phosphorylation of transcription factor ATF2, an important regulator of multiple cytokines expression. Our data revealed that both QFPDD and wogonoside decreased the half-life of ATF2 and promoted its proteasomal degradation. Of note, QFPDD and wogonoside down-regulated deubiquitinating enzyme USP14 along with inducing ATF2 degradation. Inhibition of USP14 with the small molecular inhibitor IU1 also led to the decrease of ATF2 in the cells, indicating that QFPDD and wogonoside may act through regulating USP14 to promote ATF2 degradation. To further assess the importance of ubiquitination in regulating ATF2, we generated mice that were intestinal-specific KLHL5 deficiency, a CUL3-interacting protein participating in substrate recognition of E3s. In these mice, QFPDD mitigated inflammatory reaction in the spleen, but not intestinal inflammation, suggesting CUL3-KLHL5 may function as an E3 for ATF2 degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3195805998,"Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sexual transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM) has increased markedly in Beijing, China, during the past decade. Nonoccupational HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) is a highly efficacious biomedical prevention strategy that significantly reduces HIV-transmission risk. This study examined nPEP awareness among MSM and the factors influencing it. Methods Consecutive, cross-sectional MSM surveys were conducted from April to August of 2018 and 2019. Demographic data as well as that on behavior and awareness regarding nPEP was collected. Factors influencing nPEP awareness were assessed using univariate and multivariable logistic regression. Results There were 1,202 eligible responders recruited. Of the responders, 42.5% had nPEP awareness, and 59.9% expressed interest in receiving nPEP in the future, if required. Greater odds of nPEP awareness were associated with younger age, higher education level (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 4.011, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.834–5.678, P&lt;0.001), higher income, use of the Internet to meet sexual partners (aOR: 2.016, 95% CI: 1.481–2.744, P&lt;0.001), greater HIV-related knowledge (aOR: 3.817, 95% CI: 1.845–7.899, p&lt;0.001), HIV testing (aOR: 2.584, 95% CI: 1.874–3.563, p&lt;0.001), and sexually transmitted infections (aOR: 1.736, 95% CI: 1.174–2.569, P = 0.006). Lower odds of nPEP awareness were associated with greater stigma score (aOR: 0.804, 95% CI: 0.713–0.906, P&lt;0.001). Conclusions The findings indicate suboptimal awareness and low utilization of nPEP in Beijing and highlight nPEP inequities among MSM with stigma. Strengthening the training of health service providers and peer educators in reducing stigma and disseminating nPEP knowledge is imperative."

https://openalex.org/W3195935978,"A painter is free to modify how components of a natural scene are depicted, which can lead to a perceptually convincing image of the distal world. This signals a major difference between photos and paintings: paintings are explicitly created for human perception. Studying these painterly depictions could be beneficial to a multidisciplinary audience. In this paper, we capture and explore the painterly depictions of materials to enable the study of depiction and perception of materials through the artists' eye. We annotated a dataset of 19k paintings with 200k+ bounding boxes from which polygon segments were automatically extracted. Each bounding box was assigned a coarse label (e.g., fabric) and a fine-grained label (e.g., velvety, silky). We demonstrate the cross-disciplinary utility of our dataset by presenting novel findings across art history, human perception, and computer vision. Our experiments include analyzing the distribution of materials depicted in paintings, showing how painters create convincing depictions using a stylized approach, and demonstrating how paintings can be used to build more robust computer vision models. We conclude that our dataset of painterly material depictions is a rich source for gaining insights into the depiction and perception of materials across multiple disciplines.

https://openalex.org/W3195224894,"Probability matching, also known as the “matching law” or Herrnstein’s Law, has long puzzled economists and psychologists because of its apparent inconsistency with basic self-interest. We conduct an experiment with real monetary payoffs in which each participant plays a computer game to guess the outcome of a binary lottery. In addition to finding strong evidence for probability matching, we document different tendencies towards randomization in different payoff environments—as predicted by models of the evolutionary origin of probability matching—after controlling for a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic variables. We also find several individual differences in the tendency to maximize or randomize, correlated with wealth and other socioeconomic factors. In particular, subjects who have taken probability and statistics classes and those who self-reported finding a pattern in the game are found to have randomized more, contrary to the common wisdom that those with better understanding of probabilistic reasoning are more likely to be rational economic maximizers. Our results provide experimental evidence that individuals—even those with experience in probability and investing—engage in randomized behavior and probability matching, underscoring the role of the environment as a driver of behavioral anomalies."
https://openalex.org/W3194373935,"Due to shortage of donor, kidney transplants (KTs) from donors with acute kidney injury (AKI) are expanding. Although previous studies comparing clinical outcomes between AKI and non-AKI donors in KTs have shown comparable results, data on high-volume analysis of KTs outcomes with AKI donors are limited. This study aimed to analyze the selection trends of AKI donors and investigate the impact of AKI on graft failure using the United states cohort data. We analyzed a total 52,757 KTs collected in the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) from 2010 to 2015. The sample included 4,962 (9.4%) cases of KTs with AKI donors (creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dL). Clinical characteristics of AKI and non-AKI donors were analyzed and outcomes of both groups were compared. We also analyzed risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. Although the incidence of delayed graft function was higher in recipients of AKI donors compared to non-AKI donors, graft and patient survival were not significantly different between the two groups. We found donor hypertension, cold ischemic time, the proportion of African American donors, and high KDPI were risk factors for graft failure in AKI donor KTs. KTs from deceased donor with AKI showed comparable outcomes. Thus, donors with AKI need to be considered more actively to expand donor pool. Caution is still needed when donors have additional risk factors of graft failure."
https://openalex.org/W3195689239,"The dimensionality of the spatially distributed channels and the temporal resolution of electroencephalogram (EEG) based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) undermine emotion recognition models. Thus, prior to modeling such data, as the final stage of the learning pipeline, adequate preprocessing, transforming, and extracting temporal (i.e., time-series signals) and spatial (i.e., electrode channels) features are essential phases to recognize underlying human emotions. Conventionally, inter-subject variations are dealt with by avoiding the sources of variation (e.g., outliers) or turning the problem into a subject-deponent. We address this issue by preserving and learning from individual particularities in response to affective stimuli. This paper investigates and proposes a subject-independent emotion recognition framework that mitigates the subject-to-subject variability in such systems. Using an unsupervised feature selection algorithm, we reduce the feature space that is extracted from time-series signals. For the spatial features, we propose a subject-specific unsupervised learning algorithm that learns from inter-channel co-activation online. We tested this framework on real EEG benchmarks, namely DEAP, MAHNOB-HCI, and DREAMER. We train and test the selection outcomes using nested cross-validation and a support vector machine (SVM). We compared our results with the state-of-the-art subject-independent algorithms. Our results show an enhanced performance by accurately classifying human affection (i.e., based on valence and arousal) by 16%–27% compared to other studies. This work not only outperforms other subject-independent studies reported in the literature but also proposes an online analysis solution to affection recognition."
https://openalex.org/W3196265135,"The efficacy of transfusion with hyperimmune plasma (HIP) for preventing pneumonia caused by Rhodococcus equi remains ill-defined. Quarter Horse foals at 2 large breeding farms were randomly assigned to be transfused with 2 L of HIP from adult donors hyperimmunized either with R . equi (RE HIP) or a conjugate vaccine eliciting antibody to the surface polysaccharide β-1→6-poly- N -acetyl glucosamine (PNAG HIP) within 24 hours of birth. Antibody activities against PNAG and the rhodococcal virulence-associated protein A (VapA), and to deposition of complement component 1q (C՛1q) onto PNAG were determined by ELISA, and then associated with either clinical pneumonia at Farm A (n = 119) or subclinical pneumonia at Farm B (n = 114). Data were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression. Among RE HIP-transfused foals, the odds of pneumonia were approximately 6-fold higher (P = 0.0005) among foals with VapA antibody activity ≤ the population median. Among PNAG HIP-transfused foals, the odds of pneumonia were approximately 3-fold (P = 0.0347) and 11-fold (P = 0.0034) higher for foals with antibody activities ≤ the population median for PNAG or C՛1q deposition, respectively. Results indicated that levels of activity of antibodies against R . equi antigens are correlates of protection against both subclinical and clinical R . equi pneumonia in field settings. Among PNAG HIP-transfused foals, activity of antibodies with C՛1q deposition (an indicator of functional antibodies) were a stronger predictor of protection than was PNAG antibody activity alone. Collectively, these findings suggest that the amount and activity of antibodies in HIP ( i . e ., plasma volume and/or antibody activity) is positively associated with protection against R . equi pneumonia in foals."
https://openalex.org/W3178386765,"I was busy conducting experiments, writing papers, and trying to finish my dissertation. But when I was asked to serve on a faculty job search committee, I felt I couldn't say no. I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn how I might eventually secure a faculty position of my own. However, as I read through reams of impressive applications, reality struck: It would take a lot of time and many sacrifices to build a CV that would be competitive in a faculty job search—and I could still end up empty-handed. For the first time, I began to question the academic career path I was on.



> “I was startled to learn that academic achievements were not always what mattered most.” 

Until then, I hadn't had any reason to doubt it. I was passionate about science, research, and teaching. I already had a respectable handful of publications, awards, and grants. I certainly knew I couldn't immediately jump to a faculty position—I'd need to do a postdoc or two first—but I was confident I was on the right path to securing one.

But reading through the stack of more than 200 faculty job applications shook my confidence. Each told a story of a strong devotion to science. Nearly all of them had daunting lists of publications, citations, accomplishments, and awards. Many of the applicants had magnificent letters of recommendation. And some held tenured faculty positions. A few did not stand a chance because of too little experience, sparse accolades, or unflattering letters of recommendation. But the majority were exceptionally well qualified—and they were all seeking one position.

I spent a week sorting the applications into piles marked “definitely yes,” “unsure,” and “definitely no,” ultimately landing on a short list of 10 applicants. Then I entered a conference room to meet with the four professors serving on the committee with me.

As each of us made a case for who should be invited for an interview and why, I was startled to learn that academic achievements were not always what mattered most. Many candidates whom I found exceptional were eliminated quickly because some committee members felt their specialty wasn't needed in the department. I was also disheartened to find that a few committee members who had well-funded labs and domineering personalities exerted a disproportionate influence on decisions. One professor strongly advocated for his own postdoc, even though his CV was not at all competitive. After considerable debate—and without consensus—he was invited for an interview anyway.

As I returned to the lab, I envisioned a bleak future. I could spend years making considerable sacrifices—working long hours, uprooting my wife for a series of postdocs, putting off starting a family—only to fall short of securing a faculty position due to factors outside my control.

Around that time, I also got my first exposure to working in a corporate setting. I started a part-time internship at a telecommunications company, which paid better than a teaching assistantship, allowing me to work fewer hours and spend more time writing my dissertation. I appreciated that the company valued data analyses and critical thinking, and I found it gratifying to see the impact of my work. With my interest piqued, I sat in on courses in my university's business program and read as much as I could about marketing, strategy, and business research. I began to see a career in business as an appealing alternative to the personal sacrifices, hypercompetitiveness, and arbitrary hiring decisions I would encounter in academia. After I graduated, I made the leap.

It has now been well over 20 years, and I have no regrets. At first, I worried that once I learned how to be successful in business, the work would not satisfy my intellectual curiosity. However, my career, which has taken me to a variety of companies and to my current role managing a consulting business, has delivered plenty of intellectual challenges. I have also benefited in my personal life. Because my consulting work affords flexibility, I am able to live in the city of my choice and be actively involved in my kids' activities.

My experience on the faculty job search committee may not have been what I expected. But I'm thankful it sent me on a path to reevaluating my future and moving toward a different—and extremely rewarding—career."
https://openalex.org/W3186341694,"Ei-ichi Negishi, a groundbreaking chemist in the field of organometallic chemistry directed toward organic syntheses, died on 6 June at the age of 85. Negishi pioneered the use of transition metals to break and create covalent bonds. His technique using palladium to catalyze a general reaction, now known as the Negishi coupling, earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2010 (shared with Richard F. Heck and Akira Suzuki). This reaction of organozinc reagents with halocarbons revolutionized the syntheses of natural products, bioactive compounds, drug molecules, and molecules for materials sciences. He also pioneered the use of zirconium to form a carbon-carbon bond, break a carbon-carbon double or triple bond, and form a carbon-aluminum bond.

Negishi, a Japanese citizen, was born in northern China on 14 July 1935. He received a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of Tokyo in 1958 and subsequently joined Teijin, Ltd., where he conducted research on polymer chemistry. He then moved to the United States on a Fulbright-Smith-Mundt scholarship. In 1963, he received his PhD in organic chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania. During his graduate studies, he was inspired by a lecture by Herbert C. Brown, one of two 1979 Nobel laureates in chemistry. After returning to Teijin, Ltd., for 3 more years, Negishi joined Brown's lab at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, as a postdoctoral fellow. In 1972, he became an assistant professor at Syracuse University in New York and began his lifelong study of transition metal–catalyzed reactions. He returned to Purdue University in 1979 and remained there until his retirement in 2019.

Between 1976 and 1980, Negishi's research group laid the foundation for the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions involving aluminum, zirconium, boron, and zinc reagents that would lead to his Nobel Prize. In addition, he made seminal contributions to organozirconium chemistry. His group created the highly reactive butene-ZrCp2, now known as the Negishi reagent. His zirconium-catalyzed carboalumination of alkynes and alkenes has reshaped the methods for the syntheses of various types of organozirconium and organoaluminum reagents.

I joined Negishi's group at Purdue University in 1993 as a postdoctoral fellow, although I had been familiar with his work since reading his publications on carbopalladation several years earlier. He was serious about instilling fastidious habits in his lab members, who would quickly learn to stay organized and keep detailed documentation. Negishi required us to analyze crude reaction mixtures before any means of separation to ensure that we did not lose useful scientific information, which, he reminded us, could lead to serendipitous discoveries. Before every group meeting, we were required to fill out information sheets on the results of our recent experiments, making it easy for Negishi or colleagues to check our progress. He also instructed us to collect all the hard copies of crude nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and other characterization data in the order of the corresponding laboratory notebook page numbers and keep them in file folders, making them easy to find. His documentation was so well organized that I could find collections of my own spectra in his laboratory when I returned to Purdue University in 2016, almost two decades after recording those data. In addition to meticulous record-keeping, Negishi taught me how to write effective scientific papers by showing unexpected observations to demonstrate originality.



Always open to unexpected observations from the lab and new ideas from students, Negishi was an excellent mentor. He taught me that a scientist should focus on just one or two topics and joked that if one has too many children and does not pay enough attention to them as they are growing up, they might decide to call someone else their father or mother. At the time I joined his group, many chemists were working on alkenes and alkynes, so he and I decided to pursue the unpopular topic of allenes. When I left West Lafayette, we both felt that the chemistry of allenes had great potential, and he encouraged me to continue studying them. His advice molded my career; I have now been studying allenes for more than 20 years.

Always energetic, Negishi often took group members on skiing excursions and out to eat at local restaurants—he enjoyed Chinese food, but tasting the authentic cuisine during a visit to Shanghai in the early 1990s put him off the Chinese food available in the United States. He loved playing the piano and was always ready to perform a piece or two. His favorites were classics by Beethoven, Bach, Pachelbel, and Mozart. He even conducted an orchestra during the closing ceremony of the Pacifichem 2015 conference, the world's largest meeting of the chemistry community.

The American Chemical Society honored Negishi in 1998 with the Award in Organometallic Chemistry and in 2010 with the Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry. The Royal Society of Chemistry awarded him the Sir Edward Frankland Prize in 2000. He received Japan's Order of Culture in 2010. These are just a few of the many awards and honors that recognized his work, which so drastically changed the way chemists make and break the carbon bonds in modern medicines, agrochemicals, and functional materials.

Negishi was curious, frank, fair, and always ready to debate. Organized and open-minded, he was an admirable role model. He will surely be remembered by his family, students, and colleagues for his characteristic charm and loving nature, and his work will continue to inspire scientists to develop new chemical compounds to better the lives of human beings."
https://openalex.org/W3186966576,"Every day on my way to lab, I pass a bulletin board tacked with 4-by-6 photos of a petite brunette with twinkling eyes and a broad smile. In one, she's celebrating her successful qualifying exam. In another, she's en pointe , arms arched gracefully above her head. It was in this spot just over 2 years ago that I last spoke to Maria, who was standing in the hallway eating her lunch. “Why don't you go sit down in the break room to eat?” I laughed as I passed by. “If I sit down, I'll fall asleep,” she answered. I walked on, concerned but telling myself she must have been tired from working long hours, as she always did.



> “Maria's sudden death was a wake-up call. … I was only alone to the extent that I stayed silent.” 

A few weeks later, Maria passed away suddenly from a mysterious autoimmune disease. It was as though the life went out of our department. Maria had been a near-constant, vivid presence, and a bright light of welcome to everyone who entered the building. The hallways felt empty without the echo of her laughter. Her death was especially shocking because I, like many in the department, didn't even know she'd been sick.

Maria was by all accounts the model student: She had received a prestigious fellowship, was about to publish two high-profile research articles, and was deeply involved in serving the community. It was only after her death that I learned Maria had spent the last weeks of her life searching for answers to unexplained symptoms.

As I weighed her public accomplishments against her private hospitalizations and struggle to find a diagnosis, I felt like a hypocrite. For me, hiding the effects of my connective tissue disorder—my chronic pain, crushing fatigue, and skeletal deformities—was an art form. Summer of 2013, the classes taken during my recovery from major surgery to hide my summer “off.” Summer of 2016, another major surgery and the pain of sitting through a short course too soon after having my rib cage pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle. Fall of 2016, weeks of 7 a.m. physical therapy scheduled to avoid missing classes. Summer of 2017, sleeping through my flight to a conference. Perhaps worse than any of the physical symptoms was my sense of alienation from my classmates, who seemed to know more about backpacking across the country and pulling all-nighters in the lab than appealing denied health insurance claims or juggling doctor's appointments. I wondered whether there was a place for me in academic science.

Maria's sudden death was a wake-up call. I began to reach out to fellow students, disability services, and the diversity office to discuss how to better support trainees with disabilities, chronic illnesses, and mental health conditions. We started a seminar series featuring senior scientists and clinicians with these conditions and held social events for trainees to connect over our shared experiences. Along the way, I met a classmate with a similar condition just down the hallway. As we compared notes on physical therapy techniques and whether our insurance covers compounded medications, I began to regret that I'd wasted 4 years in solitude. I was only alone to the extent that I stayed silent. I'd been so blinded by my fear of being vulnerable that I couldn't imagine the immense relief I would feel when I finally let go.

I've now talked to countless students with a range of conditions and experiences. Ironically, the one feeling we all share is a deep sense of isolation. It can seem a privilege to be able to pass as nondisabled and avoid the potential consequences of disclosure, but it is also a curse when we choose to suffer in silence.

In 4 more years, the graduate students in our department will know Maria only as a name on a plaque. But the community can honor Maria's legacy by taking steps to ease the burdens of those with chronic illnesses and disabilities. Include us in diversity initiatives. Simplify access to health care and insurance. Promote a climate that prioritizes health above productivity. Foster a sense of community where we feel safe to disclose our conditions. Show us that we belong in science and don't let us fall through the cracks."
https://openalex.org/W3194160439,"We demonstrate that simple, non-invasive environmental DNA (eDNA) methods can detect transgenes of genetically modified (GM) animals from terrestrial and aquatic sources in invertebrate and vertebrate systems. We detected transgenic fragments between 82–234 bp through targeted PCR amplification of environmental DNA extracted from food media of GM fruit flies ( Drosophila melanogaster ), feces, urine, and saliva of GM laboratory mice ( Mus musculus ), and aquarium water of GM tetra fish ( Gymnocorymbus ternetzi ). With rapidly growing accessibility of genome-editing technologies such as CRISPR, the prevalence and diversity of GM animals will increase dramatically. GM animals have already been released into the wild with more releases planned in the future. eDNA methods have the potential to address the critical need for sensitive, accurate, and cost-effective detection and monitoring of GM animals and their transgenes in nature."
https://openalex.org/W3195092265,"Social change campaigns often entail raising awareness of harm caused by people’s behavior. For example, campaigns to reduce meat eating frequently highlight the suffering endured by animals. Such messages may simultaneously attribute moral blame to individuals for causing the harm described. Given people’s motivation to protect their moral self-image, we expected that information about the suffering of animals in the meat industry presented with a blaming (versus absolving) frame would generate greater defensiveness and correspondingly resistance to change in support of veg*nism (veganism/vegetarianism). We ran three studies to test this expectation. In two studies, we found that raising awareness of animal suffering using a blaming frame increased defensiveness, leading to lower veg*n-supporting attitudes and behavioral intentions. In one study, our hypothesis was not supported, however, a mini-meta analysis across the three studies suggests the overall pattern is robust. This work expands our understanding of the role of moral self-image preservation in defensiveness and resistance to change, and has applied relevance for the development of effective communication strategies in social and moral campaigns."
