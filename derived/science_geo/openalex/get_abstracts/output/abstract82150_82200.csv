https://openalex.org/W2020133847,"Exposure of mice to ultraviolet radiation results in the development of suppressor T lymphocytes in lymphoid organs, followed by the appearance of primary skin cancers. The presence or absence of these suppressor lymphocytes determines whether or not primary cancers will develop in the ultraviolet-irradiated skin. This demonstrates the importance of immunological regulatory pathways in carcinogenesis and provides an example of immunological surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2086193519,"Initiation of 5S RNA gene transcription in Xenopus oocytes requires a 38,500 dalton polypeptide, TFIIIA. The levels of both 5S RNA and TFIIIA are regulated throughout oogenesis and embryonic development. To delineate the mechanisms by which the corresponding genes are regulated, as well as to determine the primary structure of TFIIIA, we have isolated a cDNA clone that encodes TFIIIA. Using the cDNA clone, we have determined that there is (are) one or a small number of TFIIIA gene(s) per Xenopus haploid genome, and we have estimated the size and levels of TFIIIA RNA throughout Xenopus development. We report sequence homologies between TFIIIA cDNA and regulatory regions of the Xenopus tmet and 5S RNA genes. Implications of these data for developmental regulation of the TFIIIA and 5S RNA genes are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2023970316,"Immunofluorescent staining of a pericellular matrix produced by cultured human embryonic skin fibroblasts showed a codistribution among fibronectin, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and part of the chondroitin sulfate in a fibrillar network. Isolated matrix in an “intact” form could be scraped off the dish after detergent solubilization of the cells. On centrifugation In cesium chloride density gradients, most sulfated glycosaminoglycans and matrix proteins remained associated and were recovered at a density of 1.34 g/cm3 (≥2 M CsCI). However, when 4 M guanidine hydrochloride was included in the gradient medium, the components dissociated, suggesting that the sulfated glycosaminoglycans are bound to matrix proteins by strong noncovalent linkages. Interactions between sulfated glycosaminoglycans produced by the fibroblasts and fibronectin could also be demonstrated by affinity chromatography on immobilized plasma fibronectin and by immunoprecipitation of fibronectin in conditioned culture medium, which resulted in a coprecipitation of the sulfated glycosaminoglycans. In these two systems, the fibronectin glycosaminoglycan bonds were broken at 0.2 M salt and were apparently weaker than the bonds responsible for the structural integrity of the matrix. These findings Implicate heparan and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans as Integral components of the pericellular matrix fibers and suggest that the association of the proteoglycans with the fibronectin-procollagen matrix is stabilized by multiple molecular Interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1976302793,"Endotoxin-stimulated macrophages hydrolyze fibrin by a plasmin-mediated process in the absence of detectable soluble plasminogen activator (PAs). The data show that macrophages also activate plasmin by a membrane-associated plasminogen activator (PAm). In the presence of endotoxin, PAm activity increases, and plasmin is formed only by PAm. In addition, endotoxin stimulates macrophages to secrete a proteinase inhibitor that blocks PAs activity but not PAm or plasmin activity. The increased PAm activity and the PA inhibitor secretion in response to endotoxin explains the ability of intact macrophages to hydrolyze fibrin in the absence of detectable PAs. Endotoxin, 100 ng/ml, induced an intracellular PA inhibitor in cultured macrophages, and this correlated with accumulation of inhibitor in medium over the cells. The intracellular PA inhibitor was found to be 50--60 kilodaltons by gel chromatography, to be of anionic charge at pH 7.4 and to inhibit urokinase esterolytic and proteolytic activity but not preformed plasmin. These results define two pathways of plasmin formation by intact macrophages and identify the macrophage cell surface as a site of PA activity relatively protected from soluble proteinase inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W1511176863,"The structure of vitronectin, an adhesive protein isolated from human plasma, was studied by chemical fragmentation. Partial cleavage of vitronectin with cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid generated four main fragments with masses of 53,000, 43,000, 35,000, and 12,000 daltons arising from both the 75- and 65-kDa vitronectin polypeptides and a 10-kDa fragment arising only from the 75-kDa polypeptide. By varying the reaction conditions, four BrCN cleavage sites and one acid cleavage site could be identified. The latter site gave rise to 40-, 32-, and 26-kDa fragments. The order of these fragments within the vitronectin polypeptides was determined by comparison of the NH2-terminal sequences of the polypeptides and their fragments, by further cleavage of the largest fragments with BrCN or 70% formic acid, and by assaying for heparin-binding and cell-attachment activities. The NH2-terminal sequences of the intact vitronectin polypeptides are the same and identical to a 44-amino acid serum peptide called somatomedin B, indicating that vitronectin may be the precursor of somatomedin B. The cell-attachment site appears to be located within approximately 5 kDa of the NH2 terminus, but it is distinct from the somatomedin B domain. The heparin-binding site is contained in the 12-kDa fragment near the COOH terminus. This fragment was shown to bind to a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in addition to heparin. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this glycosaminoglycan-binding fragment is remarkably rich in basic amino acids. The NH2-terminal sequences of this and the other vitronectin fragments showed no homology with the amino acid sequence of the heparin-binding domain of fibronectin or other known sequences from fibronectin. These results show that the biological activities of vitronectin are located in distinct parts of both of the vitronectin polypeptides, which appear to be identical except for the presence of an additional 10-kDa fragment near or at the COOH terminus of the 75-kDa polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1574349607,"The interaction of vanadate ions with the Ca-ATPase from sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was studied in a native and a fluorescein-labeled ATPase preparation (Pick, U., and Karlish, S. J. D. (1980) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 626, 255-261). Vanadate induced a fluorescence enhancement in a fluorescein-labeled enzyme, indicating that it shifts the equilibrium between the two conformational states of the enzyme by forming a stable E2-Mg-vanadate complex (E2 is the low affinity Ca2+ binding conformational state of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase). Indications for tight binding of vanadate to the enzyme (K1/2 = 10 microM) in the absence of Ca2+ and for a slow dissociation of vanadate from the enzyme in the presence of Ca2+ are presented. The enzyme-vanadate complex was identified by the appearance of a time lag in the onset of Ca2+ uptake and by a slowing of the fluorescence quenching response to Ca2+. Ca2+ prevented the binding of vanadate to the enzyme. Pyrophosphate (Kd = 2 mM) and ATP (Kd = 25 microM) competitively inhibited the binding of vanadate, indicating that vanadate binds to the low affinity ATP binding site. Binding of vanadate inhibited the high affinity Ca2+ binding to the enzyme at 4 degrees C. Vanadate also inhibited the phosphorylation reaction by inorganic phosphate (Ki = 10 microM) but had no effect on the phosphorylation by ATP. It is suggested that vanadate binds to a special region in the low affinity ATP binding site which is exposed only in the E2 conformation of the enzyme in the absence of Ca2+ and which controls the rate of the conformation transition in the dephosphorylated enzyme. The implications of these results to the role of the low affinity ATP binding sites are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2003822344,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) has been previously shown to be homologous to the transforming gene of simian sarcoma virus (v-sis), and inappropriate expression of the cellular counterpart of the v-sis gene (c-sis) has been implicated in the generation of mesenchymal tumors. The U-2 OS human osteosarcoma line was shown to contain multiple c-sis transcripts. Immunoprecipitation experiments with antiserum to PDGF identified a variety of polypeptides ranging in size from 18,000 to 165,000 daltons that were immunoprecipitated specifically from U-2 OS cell extracts. The osteosarcoma also was shown to secrete a 29,000-dalton protein having the serological and structural characteristics of PDGF."
https://openalex.org/W1575744217,"A 75Se-labeled hydrogenase was purified to near homogeneity from extracts of Methanococcus vannielii cells grown in the presence of [75Se]selenite. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated as 340,000 by gel filtration. The enzyme tends to aggregate and occurs also as a larger protein species (Mr = 1.3 x 10(6)). The same phenomenon was observed on native gel electrophoretic analysis. Hydrogenase activity exhibited by these two protein bands was proportional to protein and 75Se content. Both molecular species reduce the natural cofactor, 8-hydroxy-5-deazaflavin, and tetrazolium dyes with molecular hydrogen. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis of 75Se-labeled enzyme showed that 75Se is present exclusively in an Mr = 42,000 subunit. A value of 3.8 g atoms of selenium/mol of enzyme (Mr = 340,000) was determined by atomic absorption analysis. The chemical form of selenium in the enzyme was shown to be selenocysteine. This was identified as the [75Se]carboxymethyl and [75Se]carboxyethyl derivatives in acid hydrolysates of alkylated 75Se-labeled protein. The hydrogenase is extremely oxygen-sensitive but can be reactivated by incubation with molecular hydrogen and dithiothreitol."
https://openalex.org/W1566074950,"The properties of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase have been studied after modification of the ATP high affinity binding site with fluorescein isothiocyanate, both in the membranous state and after solubilization with the nonionic detergent, octaethyleneglycol monododecyl ether. Total inactivation of both membrane-bound and solubilized Ca2+-ATPase requires covalent attachment of 1 mol of fluorescein/mol of enzyme (115,000 g of protein) or per binding site for ATP. Sedimentation velocity studies of soluble enzyme showed that both unlabeled and fluorescein-labeled Ca2+-ATPase were present in a predominantly monomeric form. The phosphorylation level of unlabeled Ca2+-ATPase was unchanged by solubilization. Dephosphorylation measurements at 0 degree C indicated that the phosphorylation is an intermediate in the ATPase reaction catalyzed by solubilized Ca2+-ATPase. Fluorescein labeling of half of the Ca2+-ATPase in the membrane did not influence the enzyme kinetics of the remaining unmodified Ca2+-ATPase. Measurements of both fluorescein and tryptophan fluorescence indicated that the soluble monomer of Ca2+-ATPase like the membrane-bound enzyme exists in a Ca2+-dependent equilibrium between two principal conformations (E and E). E (absence of Ca2+) is unstable in the soluble form, but the pCa dependence of the E - E equilibrium is identical with that of the membranous Ca2+-ATPase (pCa0.5 = 6.7 and Hill coefficient 2). These results suggest that the Ca2+-ATPase polypeptides function with a high degree of independence in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1579900246,"To align the four cyanogen bromide peptides of Neurospora tyrosinase whose amino acid sequences were reported in the preceding paper, suitable methionine-containing overlap peptides were isolated. The required peptides were obtained by tryptic, peptic, and thermolytic digestion of the unmodified protein and of the maleylated derivative. From the partial sequence information of these peptides and a cyanogen bromide overlap peptide, the four cyanogen bromide fragments were aligned in the order CB3-CB1-CB4-CB2. These data establish Neurospora tyrosinase as a single-chain protein of 407 amino acids with a molecular weight of 46,000. The single cysteinyl residue 94 was found to be covalently linked via a thioether bridge to histidyl residue 96. The chemical nature of this unusual structure was elucidated by physicochemical analysis of peptides obtained from in vivo 35S, [2,5-3H]histidine, and [5-3H]histidine-labeled Neurospora tyrosinase."

https://openalex.org/W2152481941,"We have studied splicing of precursors to the large ribosomal RNA and processing of the excised intron in yeast mitochondria using primer extension with reverse transcriptase and electron microscopy. Structural features of the following intermediates are described: first, a linear RNA carrying a 5′-terminal G that is not encoded in mitochondrial DNA; second, a circular RNA in which the 3′ and 5′ intron borders are covalently linked. Three nucleotides of the 5′ intron border are absent from the site of circle closure. The properties of these intermediates fit remarkably well into the mechanism of self-splicing described for the ribosomal precursor RNA from Tetrahymena nuclei. A new feature of the yeast mitochondrial system is that the excised intron can have one of two destinies, circularization or cleavage at an internal position."
https://openalex.org/W1515539523,"Using synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleic acid probes we have identified and isolated COX6, the structural gene for subunit VI of cytochrome c oxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The nucleotide sequence of COX6 predicts an amino acid sequence, for the mature subunit VI polypeptide, which is perfect agreement with that determined previously. The nucleotide sequence of COX6 also predicts that subunit VI is derived from a precursor with a highly basic 40-amino acid NH2-terminal presequence. This precursor has been observed after vitro translations programmed by yeast poly(A+)RNA. Northern blot analysis of poly(A+) RNA from strain D273-10B reveals that COX6 is homologous to three RNAs of 1800, 900, and 700 bases length. By means of Southern blot analysis, the cloned gene was shown to be co-linear with yeast chromosomal DNA and to exist a single copy the yeast genome. An additional open reading frame, consisting of 82 codons, terminates 22 codons upstream from COX6. It is in frame with the COX6 coding region."
https://openalex.org/W1485606926,"Several iron-binding pigments (siderochromes) produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens have been isolated and partially characterized. They include ferribactin and various forms of pyoverdine, as well as some previously unreported compounds. In particular, the existence of ferribactin has been independently confirmed for the first time. Column and thin layer chromatographic procedures have been developed to fractionate, purify, and identify the siderochromes. We find ferribactin to contain nine amino acids, one residue each of glutamine, tyrosine, and glycine, and two each of serine, lysine, and N-hydroxyornithine, rather than 10 as earlier reported. Pyoverdine is a peptide with the same composition as ferribactin except for the absence of glutamine and the substitution of a fluorescent chromophore for tyrosine. Paper electrophoresis reveals an extra ionizable group in ferric pyoverdine relative to pyoverdine or ferribactin which provides that complex a definite cathodic mobility at pH 3. Optical spectra of the pyoverdine fluorescent component indicate that, in conjunction with the two hydroxamate groups, it is involved in the metal ion coordination, conferring on pyoverdine a dramatically increased affinity for Fe(III) relative to ferribactin."
https://openalex.org/W1519921402,"The porcine uterus secretes a group of basic, low molecular weight protease inhibitors under the influence of progesterone, but not estrogen. One of these inhibitors (Mr approximately 14,500) which inhibits trypsin, plasmin, and chymotrypsin, but not other proteases tested, has been purified 10- to 15-fold from uterine secretions of pseudopregnant pigs using Sephadex G-100 chromatography, CM-cellulose ion exchange chromatography, and Sephadex G-50 or Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography. The inhibitor which is relatively heat- and pH-stable forms a 1:1 molar complex with trypsin which is not dissociated in sodium dodecyl sulfate except by boiling. Chymotrypsin appears to bind at the same site on the inhibitor as trypsin. The inhibitor is high in half-cysteine residues and basic amino acids, and appears not to be a glycoprotein. Antiserum has been raised against the purified inhibitor in rabbits and used to test its distribution in pigs using the immunoperoxidase-staining technique on tissue sections. The inhibitor is associated only with the glandular and surface epithelium of the uterus. Endometrial explants from pseudopregnant animals, cultured in presence of L-[3H]leucine, release the inhibitor in radioactive form indicating that it is a uterine product. The antiserum against the inhibitor cross-reacts with at least three other, basic, low molecular weights plasmin/trypsin inhibitors in porcine uterine secretions, suggesting that a family of isoinhibitors exists which may constitute up to 15% of the protein in porcine uterine secretions. The inhibitor(s) appears to coat and to be taken up by the trophoectoderm cells of the elongating blastocyst during pregnancy. It is suggested that the inhibitors may serve to protect the uterus from proteases released by the porcine trophoblast or to prevent degradation of essential macromolecules, such as uteroferrin, which have to be taken up by the conceptus."
https://openalex.org/W1577717577,"Rabbit muscle phosphofructokinase, phosphorylated either in vivo or in vitro, can be dephosphorylated by bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase. Small but consistent differences in the allosteric regulatory properties of the phospho and dephospho forms are seen with the pattern in the direction of the phospho form being more inhibited. In vitro phosphorylated phosphofructokinase is more sensitive to allosteric inhibition by ATP and citrate and less sensitive to activation by AMP, glucose 1,6-bisphosphate, and inorganic phosphate than untreated or dephosphorylated phosphofructokinase. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate activates muscle phosphofructokinase with a K alpha less than 1 microM. The phospho-enzyme is less sensitive to activation by the bisphosphate. On the other hand, there are no differences in the sedimentation properties under a variety of conditions or in the stability of phosphorylated and dephosphorylated phosphofructokinases as shown by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and low pH inactivation, respectively."

Immunocytochemical and chemical analyses of serotonin indicate that reinnervation of the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus by the transplants is associated with behavioral recovery. The findings suggest that transplanted fetal tissue can exert functional regulation over an innate, complex, hormone-dependent behavior in adult rats."
https://openalex.org/W1524916420,"In the absence of calcium, interaction of magnesium with SR-ATPase induced a blue shift in intrinsic fluorescence emission. This Mg2+-induced fluorescence change was pH-dependent and an apparent Mg dissociation constant of 5 mM was found at pH 7. Equilibrium studies showed that magnesium competes for the high affinity Ca2+ binding sites and stopped flow measurements of the transient kinetics indicated a multistep interaction between magnesium and the calcium pump. These results suggest that magnesium drives the sarcoplasmic reticulum atpase toward an E.Mg species which might be a dead-end complex."

https://openalex.org/W1606875357,"Ferribactin and the pyoverdines, siderochromes that are obtained from liquid cultures of Pseudomonas fluorescens cells, have been studied and compared by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The proton spectra of the iron-free compounds show that the pyoverdines share with ferribactin a common feature, formyl hydroxamic acid groups, that previously had only been observed in hadacidin, and antitumor antibiotic produced by Penicillium frequentans. The 1H and 13C NMR data confirm that ferribactin is a nonapeptide that contains two residues each of lysine and N6-formyl-N6-hydroxyornithine. This corrects an earlier report (Maurer, B., Muller, A., Keller-Schierlein, W., and Zahner, H. (1968) Arch. Mikrobiol. 60, 326-339) ascribing two acetyl hydroxamic acid groups and three lysyl residues to ferribactin. Similarly, the spectroscopic data show that pyoverdine lacks the Glx and Tyr residues present in ferribactin. On the basis of the compositional analogy exhibited by pyoverdine and ferribactin, it is suggested that the two siderochromes may be metabolically related. The 13C NMR spectra of pyoverdine indicate that its fluorescent component is a nine-carbon aromatic heterocycle, probably identical with an o-dihydroxyquinoline chromophore found in pseudobactin, a fluorescent siderophore produced by Pseudomonas B10."
https://openalex.org/W1993877042,"A cytoplasmic RNA moiety is necessary for posttranslational uptake of nuclear-encoded mammalian proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix. Post-translational addition of ribonuclease to a reticulocyte lysate-programmed cell-free translation mixture inhibited subsequent import of six different mitochondrial matrix enzyme precursors into rat liver mitochondria. The required RNA is highly protected, as indicated by the high concentrations of ribonuclease necessary to produce this inhibition. The dependence of the inhibitory effect on temperature, duration of exposure to ribonuclease, and availability of divalent cations is characteristic of the nuclease susceptibility of ribonucleoproteins. The ribonuclease-sensitive component was found in a 400-kilodalton fraction which contains the mitochondrial protein precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1512573052,"Previous work with benomyl-resistant mutants of Aspergillus nidulans has demonstrated that the benA locus is a structural gene for beta-tubulin. Two of the benA mutants, benA22 and benA85, show altered electrophoretic mobilities on two-dimensional gels for two beta-tubulins (designated beta 1 and beta 2). These shifts of the beta 1- and beta 2-tubulins uncover a spot in the region where wild-type beta-tubulins migrate that is occluded on gels of wild-type extracts by the beta 1- and beta 2-tubulins. Evidence has now been obtained indicating that this spot represents an additional beta-tubulin (designated beta 3). Tubulin was partially purified from Aspergillus and run on one- and two-dimensional gels and the band or spot uncovered by the shift of the beta 1- and beta 2-tubulins was identified as a beta-tubulin by immunoblotting with monoclonal and affinity-purified polyclonal anti-tubulin antibodies and by one-dimensional peptide mapping. These observations show that Aspergillus contains at least two structural genes for beta-tubulins. Similar techniques have also been applied to a mutant showing altered alpha-tubulins to confirm and modify earlier observations suggesting that at least two structural genes for alpha-tubulins are also present."

https://openalex.org/W1662707396,"Cooperative interactions between nucleotide binding sites on beef heart mitochondrial F1-ATPase have been studied by measuring substrate-promoted release of 5'adenylyl-beta,gamma-imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP) from a single high affinity site. The site is initially loaded by incubating F1 with an equimolar amount of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog. When unbound [3H]AMP-PNP is removed and the complex diluted to a concentration below the Kd, release of ligand shows an apparent absolute requirement for medium ADP. Release is biphasic with the extent of release during the initial rapid phase dependent on the concentration of medium ADP. Although phosphate alone has no effect, it enhances the rapid phase of ADP-promoted release over 2-fold with a half-maximal effect at 60 micrometers P1. The binding of efrapeptin (A23871) to the F1.AMP-PNP complex completely prevents ADP-promoted dissociation. Although AMP-PNP release also occurs in the presence of medium ATP, the F1.AMP-PNP complex does not dissociate if an ATP-regenerating system of sufficient capacity to prevent accumulation of medium ADP is added. Consistent with an inability of nucleoside triphosphate to promote release is the failure of medium, nonradioactive AMP-PNP to affect retention of the 3H-labeled ligand. The stability of F1.AMP-PNP complex in the absence of medium nucleotide and the highly specific ability of ADP plus P1 to promote rapid release of the ATP analog are interpreted as support for an ATP synthesis mechanism that requires substrate binding at one catalytic site for product release from an adjacent interacting site."
https://openalex.org/W1506890735,"The Ca ATPase from rat liver plasma membranes has been recently characterized and partially purified in our laboratory and was shown to depend on a membrane-bound protein activator (Lotersztajn, S., Hanoune, J., and Pecker, F. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11209-11215). In the present study, we report that a factor derived from ammonium sulfate washings of rat liver plasma membranes inhibits the partially purified enzyme activity measured in the presence of activator. This factor is a protein as judged by its sensitivity to heat and trypsin. A molecular weight of 29,000 was determined by sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel chromatography. The action of the inhibitor is due to a decrease in the maximal velocity of the enzyme reaction and is reversed by an excess of the activator associated with the enzyme. An important point in the mode of action of this inhibitor is its absolute dependence on magnesium, which most probably explains the difficulty in detecting the plasma membrane Ca ATPase when MgCl2 is added to the assay medium."
https://openalex.org/W1490577302,"The ATP-dependent phosphoenzyme formation and its reversal were studied at 0 degrees C and pH 7.0 in the ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum. Addition of KCl or several other salts (approximately 100 mM) decreased the maximum rate of ADP-induced dephosphorylation of phosphoenzyme as well as the apparent affinity of the phosphoenzyme toward ADP. High ATP had a similar effect on the latter, whereas it had little effect on the former. In contrast, high KCl or a considerable change in the ionic strength had little effect on the initial rate of phosphoenzyme formation at saturating ATP concentrations. During steady state phosphorylation at 1.0 mM MgCl2 and 5.0 mM CaCl2 in the absence of added KCl, a significant amount of [gamma-32P]ATP remained bound to the enzyme even when the enzyme concentration was much in excess over that of [gamma-32P]ATP. Evidence is presented that this enzyme-ATP complex represents a precursor to the phosphoenzyme. ATP dissociated slowly (0.20 s-1) from this enzyme-ATP complex and addition of high KCl or other salts accelerated its dissociation. In contrast, when the enzyme was complexed with adenyl-5'-yl (beta, gamma-methylene)diphosphonate in the absence of added KCl under these conditions, dissociation of the nucleotide from the complex as estimated in the displacement experiment with [gamma-32P]ATP, was found to be much faster than that of ATP."

https://openalex.org/W2023129841,"Gastric acid secretion has been thought to depend on histamine stimulation of the parietal cell. However, in the 2-week-old rat neither exogenous histamine nor the H-2 receptor agonist impromidine stimulates acid secretion, whereas pentagastrin and the cholinergic agent bethanechol are potent stimuli. At this age, the effect of pentagastrin in acid secretion is not blocked by the H-2 receptor antagonist cimetidine, nor is it potentiated by impromidine. These data suggest that, in the rat pup, the acid secretory response to pentagastrin and cholinergic agents occurs before the histamine-mediated system is functional and operates independently of the actions of histamine."
https://openalex.org/W1528731263,"Cyanogen bromide (CB) cleavage of Neurospora tyrosinase resulted in four major fragments, CB1 (222 residues), CB2 (82 residues), CB3 (68 residues), and CB4 (35 residues), and one minor overlap peptide CB2-4 (117 residues) due to incomplete cleavage of a methionylthreonyl bond. The sum of the amino acid residues of the four major fragments matches the total number of amino acid residues of the native protein. The amino acid sequences of the cyanogen bromide fragments CB2, CB3, and CB4 were determined by a combination of automated and manual sequence analysis on peptides derived by chemical and enzymatic cleavage of the intact and the maleylated derivatives. The peptides were the products of cleavage by mild acid hydrolysis, trypsin, pepsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, and Staphylococcus aureus protease V8. The cyanogen bromide fragment CB1 was found to contain two unusual amino acids whose chemical structure will be presented in the following paper."

(Wattiaux, R., Wattiaux-de Coninck, S., Ronveaux-Dupol, M.F., and Dubois, F. (1978) J. Cell Biol. 78, 349-368) took up from the medium and degraded several marker protein preparations, viz. 125I-asialofetuin, [35S]methionine-labeled hemoglobin, and [3H]leucine-labeled rat liver cytosol proteins. Rates were indistinguishable for all the markers, indicating that uptake was by a nonspecific process analogous to fluid pinocytosis. No effect of added MgATP or K+ was observed. Lysosomal degradation of all the markers was inhibited by 10(-4) M chloroquine. Swainsonine, on the other hand, at 10(-5) M, inhibited the breakdown only of the glycoprotein, 125I-asialofetuin. In the presence of the inhibitors, there was an accumulation of markers in the lysosomes in amount corresponding to the decreased breakdown, indicating that uptake was unaffected. Degradation and inhibition were measured at pH 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 with both intact lysosomes and with lysosomes disrupted by the addition of 0.2% Triton X-100. Degradation with intact lysosomes was relatively independent of pH. On the other hand, activity with disrupted lysosomes was negligible at pH 7.0 and rose rapidly with decreasing pH. Inhibition by 10(-4) M chloroquine and 10(-5) M swainsonine with intact lysosomes decreased sharply with decreasing pH and did not occur with disrupted lysosomes."

After digestion with thermolysin, two pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-containing peptides were isolated and their amino acid sequences were determined to be Leu-Gly-pyridoxyl-Lys-Gln and Ile-Ala-Ser-pyridoxyl-Lys-Thr."
https://openalex.org/W1560341255,"The inhibition by light of chloroplast coupling factor ATPase is not due simply to competing photophosphorylation. This inhibition is only partially relieved by either an arsenate-pool trap for released phosphate, or a pyruvate kinase/phosphoenolpyruvate trap for ADP. Moreover, the amount of product return that does occur in the absence of trapping systems, ascertained by incorporation of 32Pi or [2-3H]ADP back into ATP during the hydrolysis reaction, is insufficient to account for the observed activity decrease. In intermediate pi:H2O oxygen exchange studies, the number of water oxygens incorporated into each molecule of Pi produced does not vary with light intensity during the ATPase assay. This indicates that the light-induced change in ATPase activity is not due to an alteration of rat constants involved in the forward and reverse partitioning of the E.ADP.Pi complex. In contrast, ammonium chloride, an uncoupler of photophosphorylation which stimulates membrane-bound coupling factor ATPase when added after light activation, causes a shift in the pattern of intermediate Pi:H2O oxygen exchange toward a lower number of water oxygens incorporated per Pi formed. The effect of NH4+ consistent with ATPase activity stimulation caused by enhanced partitioning forward of the E.products complex. These observations suggest the operation of two mechanisms of regulation of ATP ase activity during chloroplast de-energization. However, a direct effect of NH4+ on the coupling factor itself, independent of the membrane energization effect, cannot be ruled out by the present studies. Additional oxygen exchange experiments lead to the conclusion that the binding of ATP at a site catalyzing extensive ATP:H2O back exchange in the native chloroplast system ( Wimmer, M. J., and Rose, I. A. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 6769-6775) is different from the binding of ATP for net hydrolysis in the system activated for ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1558048696,"The kinetic properties of sea urchin flagellar dynein ATPase have been reinvestigated using a continuous assay which regenerates ATP and contains P1,P5-di(adenosine-5')pentaphosphate, a potent adenylate kinase inhibitor. Earlier studies (Shimizu, T. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 4347-4354) revealed complex, highly cooperative kinetics with respect to MgATP2- concentration in the absence of this inhibitor. With Ap5A, the kinetics are characteristic of classical Michaelis-Menten enzymes. Isolated 21 S and 14S enzyme forms were also examined, and their kinetic parameters are presented Vanadate inhibition patterns in the presence of P1,P5-di(adenosine-5')pentaphosphate lose their nonlinear character, and we observe linear noncompetitive inhibition of the mixed type."
https://openalex.org/W1481085248,Proton magnetic resonance was used to study the interactions between nucleosides and phosphate monoanion in dimethyl sulfoxide. Ribose was able to form two mutually exclusive 1:1 complexes involving either OH3' and OH5' or OH3' and OH2' as hydrogen bond donor groups. Deoxyribose could form only one of these complexes. A specific interaction of phosphate with the base moiety of nucleosides was observed only with guanosine. A 1:1 complex was formed involving the N(1)H and NH2(2) of guanine. Association constants for both the base and sugar complexes were determined to be in the range 50-60 M-1 at 21 degrees C in dimethyl sulfoxide. This value is more than 1 order of magnitude higher than that measured for guanine-cytosine base formation under the same conditions. Water addition to dimethyl sulfoxide led to a decrease of all association constants but the guanine-phosphate pair remained more stable than the guanine-cytosine base pair.
