https://openalex.org/W2091751789,"Cigarette smoke (CS) exposure induces mucus obstruction and the development of chronic bronchitis (CB). While many of these responses are determined genetically, little is known about the effects CS can exert on pulmonary epithelia at the protein level. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that CS exerts direct effects on the CFTR protein, which could impair airway hydration, leading to the mucus stasis characteristic of both cystic fibrosis and CB. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that CS rapidly decreased CFTR activity, leading to airway surface liquid (ASL) volume depletion (i.e., dehydration). Further studies revealed that CS induced internalization of CFTR. Surprisingly, CS-internalized CFTR did not colocalize with lysosomal proteins. Instead, the bulk of CFTR shifted to a detergent-resistant fraction within the cell and colocalized with the intermediate filament vimentin, suggesting that CS induced CFTR movement into an aggresome-like, perinuclear compartment. To test whether airway dehydration could be reversed, we used hypertonic saline (HS) as an osmolyte to rehydrate ASL. HS restored ASL height in CS-exposed, dehydrated airway cultures. Similarly, inhaled HS restored mucus transport and increased clearance in patients with CB. Thus, we propose that CS exposure rapidly impairs CFTR function by internalizing CFTR, leading to ASL dehydration, which promotes mucus stasis and a failure of mucus clearance, leaving smokers at risk for developing CB. Furthermore, our data suggest that strategies to rehydrate airway surfaces may provide a novel form of therapy for patients with CB.—Clunes, L. A., Davies, C. M., Coakley, R. D., Aleksandrov, A.

https://openalex.org/W1989542542,"IL-6 trans-signaling via the soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) plays a critical role in chronic inflammation and cancer. Soluble gp130 (sgp130) specifically inhibits IL-6 trans-signaling but was described to not interfere with classic signaling via the membrane-bound IL-6R. Physiological and most pathophysiological conditions are characterized by a molar excess of serum sIL-6R over IL-6 characterized by free IL-6 and IL-6 found in IL-6·sIL-6R complexes allowing both classic and trans-signaling. Surprisingly, under these conditions, sgp130 was able to trap all free IL-6 molecules in IL-6·sIL-6R·sgp130 complexes, resulting in inhibition of classic signaling. Because a significant fraction of IL-6 molecules did not form complexes with sIL-6R, our results demonstrate that compared with the anti-IL-6R antibody tocilizumab or the anti-trans-signaling monoclonal antibody 25F10, much lower concentrations of the dimeric sgp130Fc were sufficient to block trans-signaling. In vivo, sgp130Fc blocked IL-6 signaling in the colon but not in liver and lung, indicating that the colon is a prominent target of IL-6 trans-signaling. Our results point to a so far unanticipated role of sgp130 in the blockade of classic signaling and indicate that in vivo only low therapeutic concentrations of sgp130Fc guarantee blockade of IL-6 trans-signaling without affecting IL-6 classic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2075182577,"Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) is one of two known DGAT enzymes that catalyze the final step in triglyceride synthesis. Findings from genetically modified mice as well as pharmacological studies suggest that inhibition of DGAT1 is a promising strategy for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Here we characterize a tool DGAT1 inhibitor compound, T863. We found that T863 is a potent inhibitor for both human and mouse DGAT1 in vitro, which acts on the acyl-CoA binding site of DGAT1 and inhibits DGAT1-mediated triacylglycerol formation in cells. In an acute lipid challenge model, oral administration of T863 significantly delayed fat absorption and resulted in lipid accumulation in the distal small intestine of mice, mimicking the effects of genetic ablation of DGAT1. In diet-induced obese mice, oral administration of T863 for 2 weeks caused weight loss, reduction in serum and liver triglycerides, and improved insulin sensitivity. In addition to the expected triglyceride-lowering activity, T863 also lowered serum cholesterol. Hepatic IRS2 protein was dramatically up-regulated in mice treated with T863, possibly contributing to improved insulin sensitivity. In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, T863 enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, suggesting a possible role for adipocytes to improve insulin sensitivity upon DGAT1 inhibition. These results reveal novel mechanistic insights into the insulin-sensitizing effects of DGAT1 inhibition in mouse models. Taken together, our study provides a comprehensive evaluation of a small molecule inhibitor for DGAT1 and suggests that pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 holds promise in treating diverse metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2036310183,"Pulmonary fibrosis, characterized by excess deposition of extracellular matrix by myofibroblasts, is a serious component of chronic lung diseases. Cadherin-11 (CDH11) is increased in wound healing and fibrotic skin. We hypothesized that CDH11 is increased in pulmonary fibrosis and contributes its development. CDH11 expression was assessed in lung tissue from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients. The role of CDH11 in lung fibrosis was determined using the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, and in vitro analyses were performed on A549 cells during the process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated CDH11 expression on fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and mice given bleomycin. Interestingly, CDH11-deficient mice had decreased fibrotic endpoints in the bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis compared to wild-type mice. Furthermore, anti-CDH11-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies successfully treated established pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin. TGF-β levels were reduced in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, BAL cells, and primary alveolar macrophages from CDH11-deficient mice. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that TGF-β up-regulated CDH11 expression on A549 cells, and inhibition of CDH11 expression using siRNA reduced TGF-β-induced EMT. Together, these results identify CDH11 as a novel therapeutic target for pulmonary fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2110279208,"Cheminformatics is the application of informatics techniques to solve chemical problems in silico. There are many areas in biology where cheminformatics plays an important role in computational research, including metabolism, proteomics, and systems biology. One critical aspect in the application of cheminformatics in these fields is the accurate exchange of data, which is increasingly accomplished through the use of ontologies. Ontologies are formal representations of objects and their properties using a logic-based ontology language. Many such ontologies are currently being developed to represent objects across all the domains of science. Ontologies enable the definition, classification, and support for querying objects in a particular domain, enabling intelligent computer applications to be built which support the work of scientists both within the domain of interest and across interrelated neighbouring domains. Modern chemical research relies on computational techniques to filter and organise data to maximise research productivity. The objects which are manipulated in these algorithms and procedures, as well as the algorithms and procedures themselves, enjoy a kind of virtual life within computers. We will call these information entities. Here, we describe our work in developing an ontology of chemical information entities, with a primary focus on data-driven research and the integration of calculated properties (descriptors) of chemical entities within a semantic web context. Our ontology distinguishes algorithmic, or procedural information from declarative, or factual information, and renders of particular importance the annotation of provenance to calculated data. The Chemical Information Ontology is being developed as an open collaborative project. More details, together with a downloadable OWL file, are available at http://code.google.com/p/semanticchemistry/ (license: CC-BY-SA)."
https://openalex.org/W2127201036,"Uterine receptivity implies a dialogue between the hormonally primed maternal endometrium and the free-floating blastocyst. Endometrial stromal cells proliferate, avert apoptosis, and undergo decidualization in preparation for implantation; however, the molecular mechanisms that underlie differentiation into the decidual phenotype remain largely undefined. The Notch family of transmembrane receptors transduce extracellular signals responsible for cell survival, cell-to-cell communication, and differentiation, all fundamental processes for decidualization and pregnancy. Using a murine artificial decidualization model, pharmacological inhibition of Notch signaling by γ-secretase inhibition resulted in a significantly decreased deciduoma. Furthermore, a progesterone receptor (PR)-Cre Notch1 bigenic (Notch1(d/d)) confirmed a Notch1-dependent hypomorphic decidual phenotype. Microarray and pathway analysis, following Notch1 ablation, demonstrated significantly altered signaling repertoire. Concomitantly, hierarchical clustering demonstrated Notch1-dependent differences in gene expression. Uteri deprived of Notch1 signaling demonstrated decreased cellular proliferation; namely, reduced proliferation-specific antigen, Ki67, altered p21, cdk6, and cyclinD activity and an increased apoptotic-profile, cleaved caspase-3, Bad, and attenuated Bcl2. The results demonstrate that the preimplantation uterus relies on Notch signaling to inhibit apoptosis of stromal fibroblasts and regulate cell cycle progression, which together promotes successful decidualization. In summary, Notch1 signaling modulates multiple signaling mechanisms crucial for decidualization and these studies provide additional perspectives to the coordination of multiple signaling modalities required during decidualization."
https://openalex.org/W2029687457,"Ecosystem-based management (EBM) has emerged as a promising approach for maintaining the benefits humans want and need from the ocean, yet concrete approaches for implementing EBM remain scarce. A key challenge lies in the development of indicators that can provide useful information on ecosystem status and trends, and assess progress towards management goals. In this paper, we describe a generalized framework for the methodical and transparent selection of ecosystem indicators. We apply the framework to the second largest estuary in the United States - Puget Sound, Washington - where one of the most advanced EBM processes is currently underway. Rather than introduce a new method, this paper integrates a variety of familiar approaches into one step-by-step approach that will lead to more consistent and reliable reporting on ecosystem condition. Importantly, we demonstrate how a framework linking indicators to policy goals, as well as a clearly defined indicator evaluation and scoring process, can result in a portfolio of useful and complementary indicators based on the needs of different users (e.g., policy makers and scientists). Although the set of indicators described in this paper is specific to marine species and food webs, we provide a general approach that could be applied to any set of management objectives or ecological system."
https://openalex.org/W2078116391,"In a proteomic search for heparan sulfate-binding proteins on monocytes, we identified HMGB1 (high mobility group protein B1). The extracellular role of HMGB1 as a cytokine has been studied intensively and shown to be important as a danger-associated molecular pattern protein. Here, we report that the activity of HMGB1 depends on heparan sulfate. Binding and competition studies demonstrate that HMGB1 interacts with CHO and endothelial cell heparan sulfate. By site-directed mutagenesis, we identified a loop region that connects the A-box and B-box domains of HMGB1 as responsible for heparan sulfate binding. HMGB1-induced Erk1/2 and p38 phosphorylation is abolished when endothelial heparan sulfate is removed or blocked pharmacologically, resulting in decreased HMGB1-induced endothelial sprouting. However, mutated HMGB1 that lacks the heparan sulfate-binding site retained its signaling activity. We show the major receptor for HMGB1, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), also binds to heparan sulfate and that RAGE and heparan sulfate forms a complex.

https://openalex.org/W1977882279,"Transforming Growth Factor Beta-1 (TGF-β1) is a pleiotropic cytokine that is of central importance in wound healing, inflammation, and in key pathological processes including cancer and progressive tissue fibrosis. TGF-β1 is post-transcriptionally regulated, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. Previously, we have extensively delineated post-transcriptional regulation of TGF-β1 synthesis in the kidney, with evidence for relief of translational repression in proximal tubular cells in the context of diabetic nephropathy. In this study, we have investigated the role of the TGF-β1 3′Untranslated Region (3′UTR). Two different 3′UTR lengths have been reported for TGF-β1, of 543 and 137 nucleotides. Absolute quantification showed that, while both UTR lengths were detectable in various human cell types and in a broad range of tissues, the short form predominated in the kidney and elsewhere. Expression of both forms was up-regulated following auto-induction by TGF-β1, but the short:long UTR ratio remained constant. Incorporation of the short UTR into a luciferase reporter vector significantly reduced reporter protein synthesis without major effect on RNA amount, suggesting post-transcriptional inhibition. In silico approaches identified multiple binding sites for miR-744 located in the proximal TGF-β1 3′UTR. A screen in RNA from human tissues showed widespread miR-744 expression. miR-744 transfection inhibited endogenous TGF-β1 synthesis, while direct targeting of TGF-β1 was shown in separate experiments, in which miR-744 decreased TGF-β1 3′UTR reporter activity. This work identifies miR-744-directed post-transcriptional regulation of TGF-β1 which, given the pleiotropic nature of cellular responses to TGF-β1, is potentially widely significant."
https://openalex.org/W2074495436,"Dysregulation of dopamine (DA) homeostasis is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, drug addiction, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The neuronal plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT) is essential for the maintenance of DA homeostasis in the brain. α-Synuclein is a 140-amino acid protein that forms a stable complex with DAT and is linked to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disease. To elucidate the potential functional consequences of DAT/α-synuclein interaction, we explored α-synuclein modulation of DAT activity in midbrain dopaminergic neurons obtained from TH::RFP mice, immortalized DA neurons, and a heterologous system expressing DAT. We used dual pipette whole cell patch clamp recording to measure the DAT-mediated current before and after dialysis of recombinant α-synuclein into immortalized DA neurons. Our data suggest that intracellular α-synuclein induces a Na+ independent but Cl−-sensitive inward current in DAT-expressing cells. This current is blocked by DAT blocker GBR12935 and is absent when heat-inactivated α-synuclein is dialyzed into these cells. The functional consequence of this interaction on DAT activity was further examined with real-time monitoring of transport function using a fluorescent substrate of DAT, 4-(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+). Overexpression of α-synuclein in DAT-positive immortalized DA neurons and CHO cells expressing DAT decreased the magnitude and rate of DAT-mediated substrate uptake without a decrease in the initial binding of the substrate at the plasma membrane. Taken together our findings are consistent with the interpretation that DAT/α-synuclein interaction at the cell surface results in a DAT-dependent, Na+-insensitive, Cl-sensitive inward current with a decrease in substrate uptake, suggesting that DAT/α-synuclein interaction can modulate dopamine transmission and thus neuronal function.

https://openalex.org/W2090654517,"Spatial patterns of genetic variation in interacting species can identify shared features that are important to gene flow and can elucidate co-evolutionary relationships. We assessed concordance in spatial genetic variation between the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) and one of its fungal symbionts, Grosmanniaclavigera, in western Canada using neutral genetic markers. We examined how spatial heterogeneity affects genetic variation within beetles and fungi and developed a novel integrated landscape genetics approach to assess reciprocal genetic influences between species using constrained ordination. We also compared landscape genetic models built using Euclidean distances based on allele frequencies to traditional pair-wise Fst. Both beetles and fungi exhibited moderate levels of genetic structure over the total study area, low levels of structure in the south, and more pronounced fungal structure in the north. Beetle genetic variation was associated with geographic location while that of the fungus was not. Pinevolume and climate explained beetle genetic variation in the northern region of recent outbreak expansion. Reciprocal genetic relationships were only detectedin the south where there has been alonger history of beetle infestations. The Euclidean distance and Fst-based analyses resulted in similar models in the north and over the entire study area, but differences between methods in the south suggest that genetic distances measures should be selected based on ecological and evolutionary contexts. The integrated landscape genetics framework we present is powerful, general, and can be applied to other systems to quantify the biotic and abiotic determinants of spatial genetic variation within and among taxa."
https://openalex.org/W1971800474,"MyD88 is an intracellular adaptor protein that transmits signals downstream of immune receptors such as the IL-1 receptor and the majority of the known mammalian toll-like receptors. Homologs of MyD88 have been identified in many vertebrate species; however, the adaptor has been studied mostly in mammals, and little is known about its function in lower vertebrates. The results presented in the current paper demonstrate, for the first time, that the teleost MyD88, through its Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor domain, interacts with SsIRF3 and two SsIRF7 paralogs: transcription factors that are critically involved in the virus-induced IFN responses. The data further highlight the potential of transgenic SsMyD88 to modulate the IRF-induced type I IFN response as the adaptor synergized with SsIRF3 to activate IRF-E/IFN-stimulated response element-containing reporter gene constructs and endogenous myxovirus resistance homolog expression. Microscopy analyses demonstrated that, similar to mammalian MyD88, both endogenous and transgenic SsMyD88 accumulated in intracellular aggregates. However, unlike the endogenous SsMyD88 clusters, which co-localized with endocytosed CpGs and probably represented myddosomes, overexpressed SsMyD88 accumulated in aggresomes. Although these structures accumulated ubiquitinated proteins, they did not associate with the autophagosome markers p62 and light chain 3-like protein, indicating that they are most likely classical aggresomes rather than aggresome-like induced structures, aggregates of ubiquitinated proteins induced by toll-like receptor/MyD88 signaling in antigen-presenting cells. The significance of the accumulation of transgenic MyD88 in aggresomes is currently unknown; nevertheless it is tempting to speculate that it might represent a defense mechanism against the potentially harmful effects of excessive MyD88 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2017490507,"Unlike in budding yeast, sister chromatid cohesion in vertebrate cells is resolved in two steps: cohesin complexes are removed from sister chromatid arms during prophase via phosphorylation, whereas centromeric cohesins are removed at anaphase by Separase. Phosphorylation of cohesin subunit SA2 by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is required for the removal of cohesins at prophase, but how Plk1 is recruited to phosphorylate SA2 during prophase is currently not known. Here we report that Sororin, a cohesin-interacting protein essential for sister chromatid cohesion, plays a novel role in the resolution of sister chromatid arms by direct interaction with Plk1. We identified an evolutionarily conserved motif (ST159P) on Sororin, which was phosphorylated by Cdk1/cyclin B and bound to the polo box domain of Plk1. Mutating Thr159 into alanine prevented the interaction of Plk1 and Sororin and inhibited the resolution of chromosomal arm cohesion. We propose that Sororin is phosphorylated by Cdk1/cyclin B at prophase and acts as a docking protein to bring Plk1 into proximity with SA2, resulting in the phosphorylation of SA2 and the removal of cohesin complexes from chromosomal arms.

https://openalex.org/W2019553436,"Deficiency of serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) has been correlated with increased risk of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and influenza. A plausible reason for this association is that expression of genes encoding important antimicrobial proteins depends on concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) produced by activated immune cells at sites of infection, and that synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) is dependent on the availability of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3). Thus, increasing the availability of 25(OH)D(3) for immune cell synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) at sites of infection has been hypothesized to aid in clearance of the infection. This report details the treatment of an acute intramammary infection with infusion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) to the site of infection. Ten lactating cows were infected with in one quarter of their mammary glands. Half of the animals were treated intramammary with 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3). The 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) treated animal showed significantly lower bacterial counts in milk and showed reduced symptomatic affects of the mastitis. It is significant that treatment with 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) reduced the severity of an acute bacterial infection. This finding suggested a significant non-antibiotic complimentary role for 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) in the treatment of infections in compartments naturally low in 25-hydroxyvitamin D(3) such as the mammary gland and by extension, possibly upper respiratory tract infections."
https://openalex.org/W2043106142,"In a classical dogma, pathogens are sensed (via recognition of Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)) by innate immune cells that in turn activate adaptive immune cells. However, recent data showed that TLRs (Toll Like Receptors), the most characterized class of Pattern Recognition Receptors, are also expressed by adaptive immune B cells. B cells play an important role in protective immunity essentially by differentiating into antibody-secreting cells (ASC). This differentiation requires at least two signals: the recognition of an antigen by the B cell specific receptor (BCR) and a T cell co-stimulatory signal provided mainly by CD154/CD40L acting on CD40. In order to better understand interactions of innate and adaptive B cell stimulatory signals, we evaluated the outcome of combinations of TLRs, BCR and/or CD40 stimulation. For this purpose, mouse spleen B cells were activated with synthetic TLR agonists, recombinant mouse CD40L and agonist anti-BCR antibodies. As expected, TLR agonists induced mouse B cell proliferation and activation or differentiation into ASC. Interestingly, addition of CD40 signal to TLR agonists stimulated either B cell proliferation and activation (TLR3, TLR4, and TLR9) or differentiation into ASC (TLR1/2, TLR2/6, TLR4 and TLR7). Addition of a BCR signal to CD40L and either TLR3 or TLR9 agonists did not induce differentiation into ASC, which could be interpreted as an entrance into the memory pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that PAMPs synergize with signals from adaptive immunity to regulate B lymphocyte fate during humoral immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2099298311,"Chromogranins are the main soluble proteins in the large dense core secretory vesicles (LDCVs) found in aminergic neurons and chromaffin cells. We recently demonstrated that chromogranins A and B each regulate the concentration of adrenaline in chromaffin granules and its exocytosis. Here we have further studied the role played by these proteins by generating mice lacking both chromogranins. Surprisingly, these animals are both viable and fertile. Although chromogranins are thought to be essential for their biogenesis, LDCVs were evident in these mice. These vesicles do have a somewhat atypical appearance and larger size. Despite their increased size, single-cell amperometry recordings from chromaffin cells showed that the amine content in these vesicles is reduced by half. These data demonstrate that although chromogranins regulate the amine concentration in LDCVs, they are not completely essential, and other proteins unrelated to neurosecretion, such as fibrinogen, might compensate for their loss to ensure that vesicles are generated and the secretory pathway conserved.—Díaz-Vera, J., Camacho, M., Machado, J.

https://openalex.org/W2134192536,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an abundantly expressed proinflammatory cytokine playing a critical role in innate immunity and sepsis and other inflammatory diseases. We examined whether functional MIF gene polymorphisms (–794 CATT5–8 microsatellite and –173 G/C SNP) were associated with the occurrence and outcome of meningococcal disease in children. The CATT5 allele was associated with the probability of death predicted by the Pediatric Index of Mortality 2 (P=0.001), which increased in correlation with the CATT5 copy number (P=0.04). The CATT5 allele, but not the —173 G/C alleles, was also associated with the actual mortality from meningoccal sepsis [OR 2.72 (1.2-6.4), P=0.02]. A family-based association test (i.e., transmission disequilibrium test) performed in 240 trios with 1 afflicted offspring indicated that CATT5 was a protective allele (P=0.02) for the occurrence of meningococcal disease. At baseline and after stimulation with Neisseria meningitidis in THP-1 monocytic cells or in a whole-blood assay, CATT5 was found to be a low-expression MIF allele (P= 0.005 and P=0.04 for transcriptional activity; P=0.09 and P=0.09 for MIF production).

In 'Bench to Bedside', Bruce Walker, Rafi Ahmed and Stanley Plotkin examine a study in rhesus macaques where a vector-based viral vaccine that elicits a persistent and rapid T effector cell response to SIV antigens results in control of the infection. Although only 50% of the rhesus macaques controlled the infection, this in vivo finding stresses how outdoing the natural immune cellular response can prove effective to clear systemic viruses. But a humoral response will still remain the 'holy grail' to avoid HIV infection and transmission.

There, wolves prey primarily on muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus) and must survive 4 months of 24 hr/day winter darkness and temperatures reaching -53 C. The extent to which wolves remain active and prey on muskoxen during the dark period are unknown, for the closest area where information is available about winter wolf movements is >2,250 km south. We studied a pack of ≥20 wolves on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada (80°N latitude) from July 2009 through mid-April 2010 by collaring a lead wolf with a Global Positioning System (GPS)/Argos radio collar. The collar recorded the wolf's precise locations at 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. daily and transmitted the locations by satellite to our email. Straight-line distances between consecutive 12-hr locations varied between 0 and 76 km. Mean (SE) linear distance between consecutive locations (n = 554) was 11 (0.5) km. Total minimum distance traveled was 5,979 km, and total area covered was 6,640 km(2), the largest wolf range reported. The wolf and presumably his pack once made a 263-km (straight-line distance) foray to the southeast during 19-28 January 2010, returning 29 January to 1 February at an average of 41 km/day straight-line distances between 12-hr locations. This study produced the first detailed movement information about any large mammal in the High Arctic, and the average movements during the dark period did not differ from those afterwards. Wolf movements during the dark period in the highest latitudes match those of the other seasons and generally those of wolves in lower latitudes, and, at least with the gross movements measurable by our methods, the 4-month period without direct sunlight produced little change in movements."

This adaptation process involves activation of Nrf2 (nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2), which has been recently shown to contribute to carcinogenesis through the induction of proteasomal gene expression and proteasome activity. To verify this possible link between inflammation, oxidative stress, and Nrf2-dependent proteasome activation, we explored the impact of inflammatory (M1) macrophages on the human colon epithelial cell line NCM460. Transwell cocultures with macrophages differentiated from granulocyte monocyte-colony-stimulating factor-treated monocytes led to an increased activity of Nrf2 in NCM460 cells along with an elevated proteasome activity. This higher proteasome activity resulted from Nrf2-dependent induction of proteasomal gene expression, as shown for the 19 and 20 S subunit proteins S5a and α5, respectively. These effects of macrophage coculture were preceded by an increase of reactive oxygen species in cocultured NCM460 cells and could be blocked by catalase or by the reactive oxygen species scavenger Tiron, whereas transient treatment of NCM460 cells with H2O2 similarly led to Nrf2-dependent proteasome activation. Through the Nrf2-dependent increase of proteasomal gene expression and proteasome activity, the sensitivity of NCM460 cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand- or irinotecan-induced apoptosis declined. These findings indicate that inflammatory conditions such as the presence of M1 macrophages and the resulting oxidative stress are involved in the Nrf2-dependent gain of proteasome activity in epithelial cells, e.g. colonocytes, giving rise of greater resistance to apoptosis. This mechanism might contribute to inflammation-associated carcinogenesis, e.g. of the colon.

As an important mechanism in inflammation-associated carcinogenesis, epithelial cells undergo a permanent adaptation to oxidative stress conditions coming along with the chronic exposure to inflammatory cells and their released mediators. Along with this adaptation, the stressed epithelium acquires a cellular phenotype paving the way for the development of cancer (1Visconti R. Grieco D. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov.

One mechanism of stress adaptation is the activation of the oxidative stress-responsive cap'n collar-bZIP transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-E2-related factor-2). Under conditions of oxidative and electrophilic stress, Nrf2 is activated through its release from the inhibitory protein Keap1 (Kelch ECH-associating protein 1) and subsequent nuclear accumulation (4Kensler T.W.

Nrf2 has been primarily recognized as modulator of an antioxidative response by inducing transcription of phase II enzymes such as GST, heme oxygenase-1, or NAD(P)H-quinone oxidoreductase 1, which protect the cell from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesc-H2DCF-DA5-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorodihydro-fluoresceine diacetateGM-CSFgranulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factorSuc-LLVY-AMCN-succinyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-valyl-l-tyrosyl-7-amido-4-methylcumarinM-CSFmonocyte-colony stimulating factorM-gGM-CSF macrophageM-mM-CSF macrophagetBHQtert-butyl-hydroquinoneTRAILtumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligandAREantioxidant response element. damage (7Singh S.

This protection includes the potential of Nrf2-induced phase II enzyme expression to prevent genotoxic insults from oxidative stress, thus making Nrf2 activation a promising tool in chemo prevention of cancer (6Hayes J.D.

Electrophils and anti-oxidants such as tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) and the phytochemical sulforaphane are well known to induce Nrf2 and thereby to stimulate phase II enzyme expression. Thus, Nrf2 inducing agents have been suggested to be of substantial benefit in cancer prevention (5Osburn W.O. Kensler T.W. Mutat.

Lee C.S. Young P. Beskow A. Chan J.Y. Deshaies R.J. Mol. Cell. 2010; 38: 17-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Moreover, Nrf1 mediates the inducing effect of proteasome inhibitors on proteasomal gene expression to a greater extent than Nrf2 (31Radhakrishnan S.K. Lee C.S. Young P. Beskow A. Chan J.Y.

Cell. 2010; 40: 147-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, Nrf1 is regarded as modulator of basal proteasomal gene expression and proteasome activity, whereas Nrf2 is believed to mediate the induced proteasomal gene expression and proteasome activity (33Xie Y. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2010; 29: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), particularly in response to electrophilic and oxidative stress (34Nguyen T. Nioi P. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13291-13295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1970) Google Scholar). Through an enhanced proteasome activity in tumor cells, such as colon cancer cells (11Arlt A. Bauer I. Schafmayer C. Tepel J. Müerköster S.S. Brosch M. Röder C. Kalthoff H. Hampe J. Moyer M.P. Fölsch U.R. Schäfer H.

In the latter case, we have recently shown that Nrf2-dependent proteasome activation promotes NF-κB activation by TRAIL, an effect that mainly relies on the forced turnover of IκBα as a result of the gain of proteasome activity (11Arlt A. Bauer I. Schafmayer C. Tepel J. Müerköster S.S. Brosch M. Röder C. Kalthoff H. Hampe J. Moyer M.P. Fölsch U.R. Schäfer H. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 3983-3996Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). From TRAIL-induced NF-κB activation, increased expression level of certain anti-apoptotic genes (e.g. cIAP1) emerged (11Arlt A. Bauer I. Schafmayer C. Tepel J. Müerköster S.S. Brosch M. Röder C.

In this way, Nrf2 activation and subsequent induction of the proteasome might contribute to the acquisition of a tumorigenic phenotype of epithelial cells during inflammation associated carcinogenesis, e.g. of the colon. The present study therefore aimed at elucidating whether the presence of inflammatory cells, in particular macrophages that are a major constituent of immune cell infiltrates and a source of ROS in chronically inflamed tissues (35Laskin D.L.

Moreover, it was investigated whether under these conditions the protection of NCM460 cells against apoptosis is enhanced. Our data demonstrate that the exposure to inflammatory macrophages leads to a Nrf2-dependent increase of proteasomal gene expression and proteasome activity in NCM460 cells and as a consequence leads to apoptosis resistance. It was also found that ROS play a particular role in this response of NCM460 cells exposed to inflammatory macrophages. IL-1β and IL-6 were from Calbiochem (Mannheim, Germany). TNFα, Tiron, and catalase were purchased from Sigma. TNFα, IL-6, TGFβ, and IL-10 ELISAs were from EBioscience (Frankfurt, Germany), and the IL-1β ELISA was from R & D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany), and N-succinyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-valyl-l-tyrosyl-7-amido-4-methylcumarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC) and Mg132 were from Biomol (Taunusstein, Germany).

The cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 85% humidity. For coculture, NCM460 cells were seeded onto 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well, incubated for 24 h, and then inserts with 5 × 105 macrophages were added for 6–96 h. For the time of siRNA treatment of NCM460 cells (see below), the inserts were placed in a separate 12-well plate; afterward, the coculture of siRNA-treated NCM460 cells and macrophages continued. Transient exposure of NCM460 cells to H2O2 (200 μm) was conducted in prewarmed PBS for 30 min at standard culture conditions, and then the culture medium was replaced. Fifteen × 106 monocytes (95% purity) generated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells by counterflow centrifugation were transferred into Teflon bags (VueLife Teflon bags; Süd-Laborbedarf, Gauting, Germany) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 1% l-glutamine, 10% FCS, and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (PAA Laboratories, Cölbe, Germany) in the presence of 50 ng/ml GM-CSF or M-CSF (RELIATech, Wolfenbüttel, Germany) for 7 days as described (40Krausgruber T.

Macrophages were detached by placing the Teflon bags on ice for 1 h, and then the cells were resuspended in ice-cold PBS. The phenotype of the macrophages was verified (supplementary material) by real time RT-PCR and ELISA for determination of the expression of pro-inflammatory (IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6) versus anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and TGFβ) mediators as well as by CD11b, CD14, and CD163 immunoflow cytometry. For the determination of proteasomal activity in living cells, a fluorometric assay using the proteasome substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC was performed as described recently (27Arlt A. Minkenberg J. Kruse M.L. Grohmann F. Fölsch U.R. Schäfer H. Biochem. J. 2007; 402: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All of the measurements were carried out in duplicate. The medium of NCM460 cells was replaced by 1 ml of prewarmed PBS, and the cells were treated with 10 μm of the cellular ROS indicator c-H2DCF-DA dissolved in Me2SO or with the vehicle alone for 20 min at 37 °C. Then the labeled NCM460 cells were incubated in OPTIMEM (PAA Laboratories) for 5 min at 37 °C followed by mono- or coculture in OPTIMEM for 1, 3, and 6 h. Fluorescence in response to oxidation of c-H2DCF-DA was measured with the Techan 200 infinite microplate reader. Fluorescence units were normalized to the protein content determined in parallel. To discriminate endogenous generation of mitochondrial ROS, NCM460 cells were stained with 250 nm MitoSOXTM Red for 30 min following the manufacturer's instructions. Then cells were mono- or cultured as above, and stained cells were analyzed with the Techan 200 infinite, as well. Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts or total cell lysates was carried out as described before (11Arlt A. Bauer I. Schafmayer C. Tepel J. Müerköster S.S. Brosch M. Röder C. Kalthoff H.

After electrophoresis and semi-dry electroblotting onto PVDF membranes, the following primary antibodies were used for immunodetection at a 1000-fold dilution in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk powder, 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, and 150 mm NaCl): Nrf2 (Epitomics via Biomol), Hsp90 and Nrf1 (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany), tubulin (Sigma), S5a and α5 (both from Affiniti/Biomol, Hamburg, Germany), and cleaved caspase-3 and PARP1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt, Germany). After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the blots were exposed to the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted (1:1000) in blocking buffer and developed using the Dura detection kit (Perbio Sciences, Bonn, Germany). Data acquisition was done with the Chemidoc-XRSTM gel documentation system (Bio-Rad) using the Quantity One® software (Bio-Rad). Hsp90 served as a loading control and was used for band density normalization. Isolation of total RNA and reverse transcription into single-stranded cDNA was carried out as described (27Arlt A. Minkenberg J. Kruse M.L. Grohmann F. Fölsch U.R. Schäfer H. Biochem.

The primer sequences and PCR conditions for the detection of S5a and α5, as well as β-actin, have been described recently (27Arlt A. Minkenberg J. Kruse M.L. Grohmann F. Fölsch U.R. Schäfer H.

The data were collected during annealing steps and were further analyzed by using the iCycler iQ optical system software (Bio-Rad). All of the samples were analyzed in duplicate, and the data are expressed as the amounts of mRNA normalized to β-actin mRNA. For siRNA transfection, NCM460 cells grown in 12-well plates were submitted to lipofection using 6 μl of the HiperFect reagent (Qiagen) and 150 ng/well of either negative control siRNA (Qiagen) or Nrf2 (SI03246614; Qiagen), Nrf1 (SI00657909; Qiagen), S5a (SI03019331; Qiagen), or α5 (SI100043316; Qiagen) siRNA. After 8 h, the medium was changed, and cells were subjected to further mono- or coculture. NCM460 cells grown in 12-well plates were subjected to lipofection using Effectene (Qiagen) and either 0.2 μg of pARE and ptkRL or the empty vector and ptk-RL (all vectors from Qiagen/SABioscience). After 8 h, the medium was changed followed by mono- or coculture for up to 72 h or by treatments as indicated. Afterward, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 150 μl/well passive lysis buffer (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The lysates were centrifuged for 2 min at 4 °C at 13,000 rpm. 20 μl of the supernatant were used for the dual luciferase assay procedure, using Dual-Glow luciferase assay system from Promega. Firefly luciferase expression was normalized to constitutive Renilla luciferase expression. All of the measurements were carried out in duplicate. NCM460 cells grown onto coverslips were stained with 2 μm c-H2DCF-DA and 100 nm MitoSOXTM Red for 5 min at 37 °C in prewarmed PBS. Then cells were incubated with OPTIMEM for 5 min at 37 °C followed by mono- and coculture as specified. Analysis was done with an AxioScan fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a dip-in objective (40× magnification). Apoptosis induced by Killer-TRAIL or irinotecan was determined by measurement of caspase-3/7 activity (Promega) and of the generation of the cytokeratin 18 neoepitope (M30-Apoptosense® ELISA kit; PEVIVA, Alexis, Grünwald, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described (42Müerköster S.

All of the assays were done in duplicate. Caspase-3/7 activity and M30 immunoreactivity were normalized to the protein content of the analyzed cell lysates and expressed as activity/mg protein. The data represent the means ± standard deviation. Significances were calculated by Student's t test with data from at least four independent experiments, a p value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. To investigate whether the exposure to macrophages affects the activity of Nrf2 in NCM460 colonocytes, Transwell coculture experiments were conducted using inflammatory macrophages (M1 polarized) derived from elutriated monocytes and differentiated in the presence of GM-CSF for 7 days (43Fleetwood A.J. Lawrence T. Hamilton J.A. Cook A.D. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5245-5252Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Verification of the inflammatory phenotype was done by real time PCR analysis and ELISA detecting high level expression of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 and low levels of IL-10 and TGFβ (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, immunoflow cytometry analysis (supplemental Fig. S2) revealed high CD11b and CD14 expression but the absence of CD163 in these cells indicating M1 polarization (41Verreck F.A. de Boer T. Langenberg D.M. Hoeve M.A. Kramer M. Vaisberg E. Kastelein R. Kolk A. de Waal-Malefyt R. Ottenhoff T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). After 2 days of coculture with these macrophages (M-g), nuclear protein levels of Nrf2 in NCM460 cells, indicative of its activation, were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, higher Nrf2 protein levels were detectable in nuclear extracts from M-g cocultured NCM460 cells than in nuclear extracts from monocultured NCM460 cells. Conversely, the Nrf2 protein level in cytoplasmic extracts decreased, thus indicating enhanced nuclear accumulation of Nrf2. Next, we looked whether the increased nuclear Nrf2 protein levels correspond to higher Nrf2 transcriptional activity. For this purpose, reporter gene assays using firefly luciferase under the control of the antioxidant response element (ARE) were conducted. As shown in Fig. 1B, M-g cocultured NCM460 cells exhibited a 2–3-fold increase of ARE-driven reporter gene expression in comparison with monocultured NCM460 cells. To elucidate whether the induction of Nrf2 activation in NCM460 cells depends on the pro-inflammatory phenotype of the macrophages, coculture experiments were also set up using anti-inflammatory macrophages that were obtained from monocytes treated with M-CSF (41Verreck F.A. de Boer T. Langenberg D.M. Hoeve M.A. Kramer M. Vaisberg E. Kastelein R. Kolk A. de Waal-Malefyt R. Ottenhoff T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Real time PCR analysis and ELISA (supplemental Fig. S1) revealed lower expression of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in these M-CSF-derived macrophages (M-m), along with higher expression of IL-10 and TGFβ compared with GM-CSF macrophages. Immunoflow cytometry analysis (supplemental Fig. S2) further detected CD163 positivity of M-CSF macrophages in contrast to GM-CSF macrophages lacking this M2 marker (41Verreck F.A. de Boer T. Langenberg D.M. Hoeve M.A. Kramer M. Vaisberg E. Kastelein R. Kolk A. de Waal-Malefyt R. Ottenhoff T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4560-4565Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, after coculture with these macrophages (M-m) both the nuclear and cytoplasmic Nrf2 protein levels as well as Nrf2 transcriptional activity were not significantly altered in NCM460 cells. To investigate whether the Nrf2 induction by inflammatory macrophages (M-g) is followed by an altered proteasome activity, NCM460 cells were cocultured for 3 days and then submitted to the AMC-Suc-LLVY proteasome assay. It could be shown that the proteasome activity was significantly increased in M-g cocultured NCM460 cells when compared with monocultured NCM460 cells (Fig. 2A). By contrast, coculture with M-CSF derived macrophages (M-m) did not significantly induce proteasome activity in NCM460 cells (Fig. 2A). The significant induction of proteasome activity after coculture with inflammatory macrophages (M-g), exclusively used in all further coculture experiments, was nearly abrogated in NCM460 cells if Nrf2 expression was specifically knocked down by Nrf2-siRNA treatment (Fig. 2B, upper panel). By contrast, knockdown of Nrf1 only moderately altered proteasome activity in cocultured NCM460 cells indicating that the induced proteasome activity depends on Nrf2, but not on Nrf1. The efficacy of both siRNAs was confirmed by real time RT-PCR (Fig. 2B, lower panel) and Western blot analysis (supplemental Fig. S3). Because the Nrf1 protein is almost undetectable in the absence of proteasome inhibitors (32Steffen J. Seeger M. Koch A. Krüger E. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 147-158Abstract Full Text"

Here we proposed a novel method for heme-binding residue prediction by exploiting topological properties of these residues in the residue interaction networks derived from three-dimensional structures. Comprehensive analysis showed that key residues located in heme-binding regions are generally associated with the nodes with higher degree, closeness and betweenness, but lower clustering coefficient in the network. HemeNet, a support vector machine (SVM) based predictor, was developed to identify heme-binding residues by combining topological features with existing sequence and structural features. The results showed that incorporation of network-based features significantly improved the prediction performance. We also compared the residue interaction networks of heme proteins before and after heme binding and found that the topological features can well characterize the heme-binding sites of apo structures as well as those of holo structures, which led to reliable performance improvement as we applied HemeNet to predicting the binding residues of proteins in the heme-free state.

The transcription factor Tal1 is involved in the establishment of hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo and is a master regulator of hematopoietic gene expression in the adult. Here, we show that Tal1 is expressed in osteoclasts and that loss of Tal1 in osteoclast progenitors leads to altered expression of >1200 genes. We found that DC-STAMP, a key regulator of osteoclast cell fusion, is a direct target gene of Tal1 and show that Tal1 represses DC-STAMP expression by counteracting the activating function of the transcription factors PU.1 and MITF.

https://openalex.org/W2136796501,"Obesity is a major health concern that contributes to the development of diabetes, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and cancer. Id proteins are helix-loop-helix transcription factors that regulate the proliferation and differentiation of cells from multiple tissues, including adipocytes. We screened mouse tissues for the expression of Id1 and found that Id1 protein is highly expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT), suggesting a role for Id1 in adipogenesis and cell metabolism. Id1(-/-) mice are viable but show a significant reduction in fat mass (P<0.005) over the life of the animal that was not due to decreased number of adipocytes. Analysis of Id1(-/-) mice revealed higher energy expenditure, increased lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation, resulting in reduced triglyceride accumulation in WAT compared to Id1(+/+) mice. Serum levels of triglycerides (193.9±32.2 vs. 86.5±33.8, P<0.0005), cholesterol (189.4±33.8 vs. 110.6±8.23, P<0.0005) and leptin (1263±835 vs. 222±260, P<0.005) were significantly lower in aged Id1(-/-) mice compared to Id1(+/+) mice. Id1-deficient mice have higher resting (P<0.005) and total (P<0.05) O(2) consumption and lower respiratory exchange ratio (P<0.005), confirming that Id1(-/-) mice use a higher proportion of lipid as an energy source for the increased energy expenditure. The expression of PGC1α and UCP1 were 2- to 3-fold up-regulated in Id1(-/-) BAT, suggesting that loss of Id1 increases thermogenesis. As a consequence of higher energy expenditure and reduced fat mass, Id1(-/-) mice displayed enhanced insulin sensitivity. Id1 deficiency protected mice against age- and high-fat-diet-induced adiposity, insulin resistance, and hepatosteatosis. Our findings suggest that Id1 plays a critical role in the regulation of energy homeostasis and could be a potential target in the treatment of insulin resistance and fatty liver disease."
https://openalex.org/W2018543584,"Previous studies indicate that astrocytes are the brain cells that express acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) and that the expression is increased upon activation. However, there has been no study investigating the significance of this phenomenon. Here we report that aFGF treatment of IFNγ-stimulated human astrocytes, and LPS/IFNγ-stimulated human microglia, enhances their secretion of inflammatory cytokines and other materials toxic to human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. The mechanism of aFGF enhancement involves stimulation of the receptor FGFR2 IIIb. We show by RT-PCR that this receptor, but not other FGF receptors, is robustly expressed by astrocytes and microglia. We establish by Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry on postmortem human brain tissue that the FGFR2 IIIb protein is expressed by both of these glial cell types. We blocked the inflammatory stimulant action of aFGF by transfecting microglia and astrocytes with a small inhibitory RNA (siRNA) to FGFR2 IIIb as well as by removal of aFGF using an anti-aFGF antibody. Treatment with bFGF in combination with the stimulants was without effect, but together with aFGF, it partially counteracted the action of aFGF, indicating that it may be a weak antagonist of FGFR2 IIIb. The inflammatory effect was also attenuated by treatment with inhibitors of protein kinase C, Src tyrosine kinase, and MEK-1/2 indicating the involvement of these intracellular pathways. Our data suggest that inhibition of expression or release of aFGF could have therapeutic potential by inhibiting inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease where many neuroinflammatory molecules are prominently expressed."

https://openalex.org/W2000087003,"The Escherichia coli O9a O-polysaccharide (O-PS) represents a model system for glycan biosynthesis and export by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-dependent pathway. The polymannose O9a O-PS is synthesized using an undecaprenol-diphosphate-linked acceptor by mannosyltransferases located at the cytoplasmic membrane. An ABC-transporter subsequently exports the polymer to the periplasm where it is assembled onto lipopolysaccharide prior to translocation to the cell surface. The chain length of the O9a O-PS is regulated by the dual kinase/methyltransferase activity of the WbdD enzyme and modification of the polymer is crucial for binding and export by the ABC-transporter. Previous biochemical data provided evidence for phosphorylation/methylation at the non-reducing end of the O9a O-PS but the structure of the terminus has not been determined. Here, we describe the exploitation of a synthetic O9a O-PS repeating unit carrying a fluorescent tag as an acceptor for in vitro phosphorylation and methylation by a purified soluble form of WbdD. Phosphorylation of the acceptor was evident by both a mobility shift in thin layer chromatography and radiolabeling of the acceptor using [γ-(33)P]ATP. Methylation of the acceptor was dependent on phosphorylation and was demonstrated by radiolabeling using S-[methyl-(3)H]adenosyl-methionine as a substrate, in the presence of ATP. NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric methods were used to determine the precise structure of the terminal modification, leading to the conclusion that WbdD catalyzes the addition of a novel methyl phosphate group to the 3-position of the non-reducing terminal mannose of the O9a O-PS repeating unit."

The present study was designed to investigate the potential role of RGC-32 in renal fibrosis following unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a model of kidney disease with progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Our results show that UUO causes structural damage and collagen deposition along with increased expression of RGC-32 in kidney interstitial cells at the early stage of the injury. Blockade of RGC-32 expression significantly attenuates UUO-induced renal damage, ECM production, and expression of myofibroblast marker. Studies using mesenchymal and kidney fibroblasts indicate that RGC-32 induces fibroblast activation in vitro. Additional studies demonstrate that RGC-32 interacts with Smad3 to enhance its binding to α-SMA promoter, thus regulate Smad3 induction of myofibroblast marker transcription. Together, our results have identified RGC-32 as a novel fibrogenic factor contributing to the onset of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. All surgeries were performed according to protocols overseen by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Georgetown University. Male C57BL6/J mice, weighing 20–25 g at the start of the experiment, were anesthetized with pentobarbital and tracheotomized. UUO was achieved by double-ligating the left ureter with 3–0 silk through a left lateral incision. Sham-operated animals (n = 5) were used as controls. Mice were sacrificed at 3, 5, 7, 10, or 15 days (for each group, n = 5) after the UUO, and the obstructed kidneys were harvested and subjected to the studies described below. shRNA is constructed in pGeneClip vector (Promega). The delivery was performed by injection of scrambled or RGC-32 shRNA plasmids through the renal artery using the In Vivo Gene Delivery System (Mirus). The mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body wt). The femoral and abdominal areas of the mice were shaved and treated with chlorhexidine as described in UUO model. The abdominal aorta was exposed via a midline abdominal incision. The left femoral artery was exposed by an inguinal incision on the ventral side of the left thigh. Using a stereo-microscope, a PE-10 catheter, heat-stretched to 180 micra, was inserted into the femoral artery (through an appropriately sized incision) and pushed inside the abdominal aorta to a position just above the left renal artery but below the right renal artery. This position was verified by gently lifting the vessel using a small forceps. This procedure allowed the selective and exclusive delivery of reagents into the left kidney. The abdominal aorta was clamped below the right renal artery and below the left renal artery, to ensure delivery of the reagents only into the left kidney. In our preliminary studies, the clamping procedure did not affect renal function or histology. After the injection of the reagents in a 200 μl solution (with lissamine green) in 20 s using a 1 ml tuberculin syringe, the catheter was carefully retracted. The left ureter was then sham- or double-ligated to generate UUO. The incision on the femoral artery was repaired using 11–0 silk sutures and the skin incisions closed. Kidney tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections (5 μm thick) were stained with H&E or Masson's trichrome staining for histopathological analysis.

Briefly, 5 μg of biotin-labeled double-strand oligonucleotides, and 500 ng of Smad3, Smad4 (SignalChem), and/or RGC-32 proteins were incubated in a binding buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 4% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm Tris) at 37 °C for 1 h. Streptavidin-coated agarose beads (Sigma) were then added followed by end-over-end rotation at 4 °C overnight. The agarose beads were pelleted and washed with cold 1× PBS three times, and proteins bound to the beads were eluted and immunoblotted with Smad3, Smad4, or RGC-32 antibodies. RGC-32 proteins were obtained by expression of pETDuet-1-RGC32 in E. coli and purified by His-Spin Protein Miniprep kit (Zymo Research). pETDuet-1-RGC32 was cloned by insertion of full-length mouse RGC-32 cDNA into pETDuet-1 expression vector at BamHI/SalI sites. The cDNA insertion was verified by sequencing and the purity of RGC-32 protein was verified by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot using RGC-32 antibody.

NRK-49F cells were treated with vehicle or TGF-β for 24 h followed by additional 1 h of treatment with new TGF-β to induce Smad nuclear translocation. Chromatin complexes were immunoprecipitated with 3 μg of Smad2 or Smad3 antibody or IgG (negative control). Semi-quantitative PCR and/or qPCR were performed to amplify the α-SMA promoter region containing the functional Smad binding site using the following primer set: 5′-CAT GCA CGT GGA CTG TAC CT-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAA GAT GCT TGG GTC ACC TG-3′ (reverse) (26Hu B.

All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using ANOVA with pairwise comparisons between groups. A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To determine if RGC-32 is involved in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, we first determined if RGC-32 expression in kidney is altered by UUO. RGC-32 was found to be expressed in mouse kidney (29Badea T. Niculescu F. Soane L. Fosbrink M. Sorana H. Rus V. Shin M.L. Rus H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but precisely which cells express RGC-32 has not been determined. We found that RGC-32 was expressed only in smooth muscle cells (SMC) of blood vessels in the normal mouse kidney as indicated by α-SMA staining (Fig. 1A, panel IV). 5 days after the UUO, RGC-32 was strongly induced in the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 1A, panel V). Importantly, α-SMA expression was also limited to the interstitial cells of obstructed kidney at this early stage (Fig. 1A, panel VIII), suggesting that RGC-32 plays a role in the activation of myofibroblasts from resident fibroblasts. By 15 days after the UUO, RGC-32, and α-SMA were extensively expressed in both kidney interstitium and tubules (Fig. 1A, panels VI and IX). At this time point, severe kidney structural damages including glomeruli atrophy, tubule dilation, and atrophy, inflammatory cell infiltration, and extensive interstitial fibrosis were observed (Fig. 1A, panel III). These results indicate that RGC-32 is induced along with myofibroblast activation by UUO. To examine the dynamics of RGC-32 expression induced by progressive injury due to UUO, kidney proteins were extracted 5, 10, and 15 days after the UUO and blotted with RGC-32 and α-SMA antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1B, both RGC-32 and α-SMA were significantly up-regulated 5 days after UUO. The expression increased with the duration of UUO. It appeared that RGC-32 expression reached the highest level at 10 days after UUO and remains unchanged at 15 days after UUO. Interestingly, the expression of α-SMA correlated with the activation of RGC-32 (Fig. 1C). To test if RGC-32 plays a role in the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis, we developed a method to infuse RGC-32 shRNA into mouse kidney through renal artery using an In Vivo Gene Delivery System. Using this method, we infused control or RGC-32 shRNA into mouse left kidneys followed by UUO for 10 days. As shown in Fig. 2A, shRNA knockdown of UUO-induced RGC-32 expression blocked α-SMA expression in the interstitial cells (Fig. 2A, panels II and IV). RGC-32 shRNA did not block RGC-32 or α-SMA expression in SMC of the blood vessels (Fig. 2A, panels II and IV) because SMC in the blood vessels normally expresses a significant amount of RGC-32 protein before UUO operation (Fig. 1A, panel IV). It is known that shRNA only degrades the newly synthesized mRNA but does not affect pre-existing proteins. Quantitative analyses show that UUO kidneys with control shRNA strongly expressed RGC-32 and α-SMA proteins (Fig. 2, B and C). However, RGC-32 shRNA, which blocked the expression of RGC-32 with an 80% knockdown efficiency, caused a 50% reduction of α-SMA expression induced by UUO (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that RGC-32 is essential for myofibroblast activation in kidney interstitium in the onset or progression of UUO-induced renal fibrosis. Excessive synthesis and accumulation of ECM proteins in kidney interstitium is a hallmark of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, as seen in obstructive nephropathy. ECM deposition results in kidney structural damage and functional impairment. To determine if RGC-32 plays a role in ECM deposition as well as structural damage induced by UUO, we observed kidney structural alteration by H&E staining and examined the expression of collagen I by Masson's trichrome staining and Western blot in kidneys infused with control or RGC-32 shRNA. Structurally, UUO caused dilatation of renal tubules, denudation of basement membranes, and interstitial expansion, consistent with previous reports (30Cochrane A.L. Kett M.M. Samuel C.S. Campanale N.V. Anderson W.P. Hume D.A. Little M.H. Bertram J.F. Ricardo S.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 3623-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A, panel II). RGC-32 knockdown by shRNA, however, significantly reduced UUO-induced damage. RGC-32 shRNA restored the normal structure of proximal tubules and eliminated the interstitial expansion (Fig. 3A, panel III). These data suggest that RGC-32 contributed, at least in part, to the structural damage in the progressive nephropathy. RGC-32 appears to be important for ECM production in UUO-induced nephropathy. Compared with sham-operated mice, UUO induced a significant amount of collagen accumulation in kidney tubulointerstitium (Fig. 3A, panel V). RGC-32 shRNA, however, significantly inhibited the accumulation of collagen (Fig. 3A, panel VI) in kidney interstitium. Western blot showed that UUO induced a significant increase in collagen I expression in the kidney 10 days after the UUO. RGC-32 knockdown, however, significantly blocked collagen I expression (Fig. 3, B and C). These data demonstrate that RGC-32 is required for collagen I synthesis and accumulation in the renal interstitium in obstructive nephropathy. Although myofibroblasts may originate from several sources including resident mesenchymal fibroblasts, epithelial cells via EMT, endothelial cells via endothelial-mesenchymal transition, and circulating fibroblast-like cells called fibrocytes derived from bone-marrow stem cells (7Wynn T.A. J. Pathol. 2008; 214: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar, 8Yang N. Wu L.L. Nikolic-Paterson D.J. Ng Y.Y. Yang W.C. Mu W. Gilbert R.E. Cooper M.E. Atkins R.C. Lan H.Y. Nephrol.

UUO induced interstitial expression of both RGC-32 and α-SMA in mouse kidneys, especially in the early stages of obstructive nephropathy (Fig. 1A, panels V, VIII), suggesting that the α-SMA-producing myofibroblasts were derived from interstitial fibroblasts. TGF-β, which is activated in kidneys 3 days after UUO, plays a central role in activating fibroblasts in renal fibrosis (2Klahr S. J. Nephrol. 2003; 16: 179-185PubMed Google Scholar, 31Klahr S.

Kidney Dis. 1995; 26: 133-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Because RGC-32 is a TGF-β downstream target (18Li F. Luo Z. Huang W. Lu Q. Wilcox C.S. Jose P.A. Chen S. J.

To test this hypothesis, we used C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) mesenchymal progenitor cells (Fig. 4A, B, and D)) and kidney fibroblast NRK-49F cells (Fig. 4C) as models to study the induction of myofibroblasts by TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 4, A–C, TGF-β induced myofibroblast differentiation of 10T1/2 and NRK-49F cells as indicated by the expression of myofibroblast marker genes α-SMA and collagen I. TGF-β also induced RGC-32 expression during the fibroblast activation (Fig. 4, A–C). The induction of RGC-32 occurred as early as 2 h after TGF-β induction (Fig. 4A), suggesting that RGC-32 plays a role in TGF-β-induced fibroblast activation. To test if RGC-32 is important for TGF-β-induced fibroblast activation, we expressed control or RGC-32 shRNA in 10T1/2 (Fig. 4B) and NRK-49F cells (Fig. 4C) and then treated the cells with TGF-β for 24 h and studied the effect of RGC-32 knockdown on myofibroblast markers. Control shRNA did not affect the expression of RGC-32 and myofibroblast markers in TGF-β-treated cells. RGC-32 shRNA, however, significantly inhibited TGF-β-induced expression of RGC-32 as well as α-SMA and collagen I (Fig. 4, B and C). These results indicate that RGC-32 is essential for TGF-β-induced fibroblast activation. To determine if RGC-32 alone induces fibroblast activation, RGC-32 cDNA was transfected in 10T1/2 cells; and myofibroblast marker gene expression was examined. Interestingly, RGC-32 by itself was sufficient to induce the expression of myofibroblast markers (Fig. 4D). TGF-β function is mediated by both Smad2 and Smad3. In fibroblasts, it appears that Smad3, but not Smad2, is important for the activation of α-SMA promoter activity (20Chen S. Kulik M. Lechleider R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1302-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Qiu P. Feng X.H. Li L. J. Mol.

TGF-β-induced collagen type I and III expression is ablated in Smad3 knock-out (KO) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF), but not in the Smad2 KO MEF (15Wang W. Koka V. Lan H.Y. Nephrology. 2005; 10: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although Smad2 is also involved, Smad3 appears to play a major role in activating fibroblasts and fibrosis (15Wang W. Koka V. Lan H.Y. Nephrology. 2005; 10: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16Sato M. Muragaki Y. Saika S. Roberts A.B. Ooshima A. J. Clin.

Because RGC-32 and Smad3 are both involved in regulating the promoter activity of myofibroblast marker α-SMA in different cells (18Li F. Luo Z. Huang W. Lu Q. Wilcox C.S. Jose P.A. Chen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10133-10137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Sinha S. Hoofnagle M.H. Kingston P.A. McCanna M.E. Owens G.K. Am. J. Physiol.

Biol. 2007; 36: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that RGC-32 interacts with Smad3 to induce fibroblast activation. To test if RGC-32 and Smad3 physically interacts, Co-IP was performed by overexpressing RGC-32, Smad2 and Smad3 individually or in combination in 10T1/2 cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, RGC-32 strongly interacted with Smad3, but slightly with Smad2 in 10T1/2 cells. To confirm these interactions, Co-IP was performed using endogenous proteins extracted from 10T1/2 cells. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 5, B and C, RGC-32 appeared to interact with both Smad2 and Smad3 (left panels of Fig. 5, B and C). These interactions were specific because shRNA knockdown of Smad2 or Smad3 diminished the Co-IP between RGC-32 and Smad2 or Smad3 (Fig. 5, B and C, right panels). Smad3 regulates α-SMA gene transcription through binding to SBE in the α-SMA promoter (35Kennard S. Liu H. Lilly B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1324-1333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To test if Smad2 or Smad3 interacts with SBE in α-SMA promoter in a chromatin setting in kidney fibroblasts, CHIP assays were performed. We found that Smad3, but not Smad2, bound the functional SBE in α-SMA promoter in vivo in kidney fibroblasts (Fig. 6A). Because RGC-32 interacts with Smad3, we sought to determine if RGC-32 plays a role in Smad3 interaction with α-SMA promoter in vivo. Adenoviral vector expressing GFP or RGC-32 shRNA was transduced into NRK-49F cells followed by vehicle or TGF-β treatment. Endogenous Smad3 binding to SBE in α-SMA promoter was assessed by CHIP assay. We found that TGF-β induced an enhanced binding of Smad3 to α-SMA promoter (Fig. 6, B and C). RGC-32 knockdown, However, significantly blocked TGF-β-enhanced Smad3 interaction with the promoter (Fig. 6, B and C), suggesting that RGC-32 is essential for Smad3 binding to SBE in α-SMA promoter in kidney fibroblasts, thus regulating Smad3-mediated α-SMA promoter activity. To determine if RGC-32 enhances Smad3 interaction with promoters of other fibroblast activation-related genes, we tested Smad3 binding to the SBE in the promoter of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). PAI-1 plays an important role in fibroblast activation and renal fibrosis (37Eddy A.A. Fogo A.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2999-3012Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, D and E, similar to α-SMA promoter, TGF-β increased the Smad3 binding to SBE of PAI-1 promoter, shRNA knockdown of RGC-32, however, significantly inhibited Smad3 binding. These results suggest that RGC-32 is crucial for Smad3 interaction with promoters of multiple fibroblast activation genes. To further determine the role of RGC-32 in Smad3 interaction with α-SMA promoter, we performed DNA affinity assay with purified Smad3, Smad4, and RGC-32 proteins and biotin-labeled DNA oligonucleotides containing wild type or mutant SBE. Smad3 bound to α-SMA in a dose-dependent manner; SBE mutation diminished the binding (Fig. 7A). Both Smad4 and RGC-32 enhanced the Smad3 binding to the SBE site (Fig. 7, B and C). Importantly, combination of RGC-32 and Smad4 further increased the Smad3 binding (Fig. 7, B and C), demonstrating that RGC-32 is able to increase the Smad3 binding affinity to α-SMA promoter with or without the presence of Smad4. To determine if RGC-32-mediated Smad3 binding to α-SMA promoter plays a role in fibroblast activation, we tested if RGC-32 affects Smad3-induced α-SMA promoter activity in both 10T1/2 (Fig. 8A) and NRK-49F cells (Fig. 8B). We found that only Smad3, but not Smad2, significantly increased α-SMA promoter activity in both cells (Fig. 8), consistent with their role in renal fibrosis (15Wang W. Koka V. Lan H.Y. Nephrology. 2005; 10: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16Sato M. Muragaki Y. Saika S. Roberts A.B. Ooshima A. J. Clin.

Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 1407-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Smad3-induced promoter activity was diminished, however, by RGC-32 shRNA in both mesenchymal (Fig. 8A) and kidney fibroblasts (Fig. 8B), demonstrating that RGC-32 is required for Smad3 function in inducing fibroblast activation. RGC-32 shRNA also reduced α-SMA promoter activity in control (Fig. 8B) or Smad2-transfected cells (Fig. 8, A and B), but this effect is likely due to the interruption of endogenous RGC-32/Smad3 interaction by RGC-32 shRNA. It was not an effect on Smad2 activity because Smad2 did not increase α-SMA promoter activity (Fig. 8). These data demonstrate that RGC-32 enhances Smad3 binding, and thus activates the promoters of myofibroblast marker genes to mediate TGF-β-induced fibroblast activation, which may lead to the generation of myofibroblasts in kidney interstitium when the mouse is subjected to progressive injury as seen in obstructive injury and UUO. Emerging evidence indicates that TGF-β is a key mediator in the progression of renal fibrosis (38Border W.A. Noble N.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 331: 1286-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). Tubulointerstitial fibrosis is an inevitable common pathway of chronic kidney diseases (CKD) resulting from many disorders, including hypertension, diabetes, infection, inflammation, kidney stones, and cysts (39Chatziantoniou C. Dussaule J.C. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2005; 289: F227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The extent of tubulointerstitial damage correlates with renal prognosis (40Eddy A.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 2495-2508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidation of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in the progression of tubulointerstitial fibrosis is important for designing a strategy to prevent progressive kidney diseases leading to end-stage renal failure. Many studies have shown that TGF-β signaling intermediate Smad proteins including Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7 play important roles in the progression of renal fibrosis (16Sato M. Muragaki Y. Saika S. Roberts A.B. Ooshima A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 41Fukasawa H. Yamamoto T. Togawa A. Ohashi N. Fujigaki Y. Oda T. Uchida C. Kitagawa K.

Kaneko K. Yamashiro Y. Ogawa H. Nakao A. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, the downstream targets essential for the onset of the fibrosis especially fibroblast activation, however, remain largely unknown. RGC-32, a complement-activated gene, was identified as a TGF-β downstream target, which plays an important role in smooth muscle differentiation from neural crest cells (18Li F. Luo Z. Huang W. Lu Q. Wilcox C.S. Jose P.A. Chen S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10133-10137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). RGC-32 is also involved in the EMT of renal epithelial cells in vitro (19Huang W.Y. Li Z.G. Rus H. Wang X. Jose P.A. Chen S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 9426-9432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Because the relative contribution of EMT to renal fibrosis is still being debated (43Schnaper H.W. Kopp J.B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), RGC-32-induced EMT may not contribute to the development of renal fibrosis in vivo. Indeed, our data show that RGC-32 is mainly induced in interstitial cells in mouse kidneys with UUO, especially in the early stage of renal fibrosis. The induction correlates with the expression of myofibroblast marker α-SMA (Fig. 1), suggesting a role of RGC-32 in fibroblast activation in the kidney interstitium. Knockdown of RGC-32 by shRNA significantly attenuates the expression of both RGC-32 and α-SMA after 10 days of UUO (Fig. 2), demonstrating that RGC-32 is essential for fibroblast activation. Knockdown of RGC-32 also ameliorates kidney structural damage and ECM deposition in the kidney interstitium caused by UUO, suggesting that RGC-32 may be an ideal target for reversing the progression of renal fibrosis. Although RGC-32 is also expressed in renal tubules at the later stages of fibrosis, e.g. 15 days after UUO, the EMT events of the tubule cells such as migration and invasion are not evident in kidneys with UUO (10Humphreys B.D. Lin S.L. Kobayashi A. Hudson T.E. Nowlin B.T. Bonventre J.V. Valerius M.T. McMahon A.P. Duffield J.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2010; 176: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of RGC-32 in EMT of renal tubule cells in vivo can only be determined after the EMT mechanism in the obstructive nephropathy is well-defined. RGC-32 is important for fibroblast activation in both mesenchymal and kidney fibroblasts. RGC-32 knockdown by shRNA blocks TGF-β-induced marker gene expression (Fig. 4, B and C). Mechanistically, RGC-32 appears to partner with Smad3 to regulate fibroblast activation. It is well documented that Smad3 is critical for the induction of renal fibrosis (16Sato M. Muragaki Y. Saika S. Roberts A.B. Ooshima A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1486-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 42Inazaki K. Kanamaru Y. Kojima Y. Sueyoshi N. Okumura K. Kaneko K. Yamashiro Y.

Both of RGC-32 and Smad3 are TGF-β downstream effectors important for fibroblast activation (Fig. 4) (15Wang W. Koka V. Lan H.Y. Nephrology. 2005; 10: 48-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 16Sato M. Muragaki Y. Saika S. Roberts A.B. Ooshima A. J. Clin.

These observations suggest that RGC-32 interacts with Smad3 in activating fibroblasts. Indeed, RGC-32 physically interacts with Smad3 (Fig. 5). Although RGC-32 also interacts with Smad2, Smad2 does not bind to α-SMA promoter and is not involved in TGF-β-induced fibroblast activation (Figs. 6A and 8). RGC-32 appears to induce fibroblast activation through enhancing Smad3 binding to SBE of myofibroblast marker genes. Smad3, but not Smad2, binds to the SBE of α-SMA promoter. TGF-β enhances Smad3 binding. TGF-β-induced Smad3-SBE interaction requires RGC-32 because knockdown of RGC-32 attenuates Smad3 binding to α-SMA promoter in vivo. In addition to α-SMA, RGC-32 also increases Smad3 binding to PAI-1 promoter, suggesting that RGC-32 may regulate several different fibroblast activation-related genes via enhancing Smad3 binding to SBE in their promoters. Importantly, RGC-32 appears to increase Smad3 binding affinity independent of Smad4 because RGC-32 is able to enhance Smad3 binding to SBE of α-SMA promoter in the absence of Smad4. In the presence of Smad4, RGC-32 can further increase Smad4-enhanced Smad3 binding. Functionally, RGC-32 is essential for TGF-β-induced α-SMA promoter activation in fibroblasts. Smad3 is required for TGF-β function in activating the promoter, but Smad3 function is dependent on RGC-32 because RGC-32 knockdown blocks Smad3-mediated promoter activity (Fig. 8), suggesting that RGC-32 functionally interacts with Smad3 in the activation of α-SMA promoter. In conclusion, we have identified RGC-32 as a novel fibrogenic factor in the progression of renal fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy in UUO model. We have also demonstrated that RGC-32 mediates TGF-β-induced fibroblast activation by interacting with Smad3, leading to an enhanced Smad3 binding to SBE, which activate the transcription programs of myofibroblast marker genes."

Here we describe alternative T cell-staining reagents that are superior to conventional reagents. They are built on reversible chelate complexes of Ni(2+)-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) with oligohistidines. We synthesized biotinylated linear mono-, di-, and tetra-NTA compounds using conventional solid phase peptide chemistry and studied their interaction with HLA-A*0201-peptide complexes containing a His(6), His(12), or 2×His(6) tag by surface plasmon resonance on SA-coated sensor chips and equilibrium dialysis. The binding avidity increased in the order His(6) < His(12) < 2×His(6) and NTA(1) < NTA(2) < NTA(4), respectively, depending on the configuration of the NTA moieties and increased to picomolar K(D) for the combination of a 2×His(6) tag and a 2×Ni(2+)-NTA(2). We demonstrate that HLA-A2-2×His(6)-peptide multimers containing either Ni(2+)-NTA(4)-biotin and PE-SA- or PE-NTA(4)-stained influenza and Melan A-specific CD8+ T cells equal or better than conventional multimers. Although these complexes were highly stable, they very rapidly dissociated in the presence of imidazole, which allowed sorting of bona fide antigen-specific CD8+ T cells without inducing T cell death as well as assessment of HLA-A2-peptide monomer dissociation kinetics on CD8+ T cells."

Pyrosequencing and library annotation was performed on pooled RNA from the CNS and lymphoid tissues on horses experimentally infected with WNV (vaccinated and naïve) and non-exposed controls. These sequences were used to create a custom microarray enriched for neurological and immunological sequences to quantitate gene expression in the thalamus and cerebrum of three experimentally infected groups of horses (naïve/WNV exposed, vaccinated/WNV exposed, and normal). From the sequenced transcriptome, 41,040 sequences were identified by alignment against five databases. 31,357 good sequence hits (e<10−4) were obtained with 3.1% of the sequences novel to the equine genome project. Sequences were compared to human expressed sequence tag database, with 31,473 equine sequences aligning to human sequences (69.27% contigs, 78.13% seed contigs, 80.17% singlets). This indicated a high degree of sequence homology between human and equine transcriptome (average identity 90.17%). Significant differences (p<0.05) in gene expression were seen due to virus exposure (9,020), survival (7,395), and location (7,649). Pathways analysis revealed many genes that mapped to neurological and immunological categories. Involvement of both innate and adaptive components of immunity was seen, with higher levels of expression correlating with survival. This was highlighted by increased expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 in horses exposed to WNV which functions to suppress innate immunity. Pentraxin 3 was most increased in expression for all horses exposed to WNV. Neurological pathways that demonstrated the greatest changes in gene expression included neurotransmitter and signaling pathways. Decreased expression of transcripts in both the glutamate and dopamine signaling pathways was seen in horses exposed to WNV, providing evidence of possible glutamate excitotoxicity and clinical signs associated with decreased dopamine. Many transcripts mapped to non-infectious neurological disease functions, including mental disorders and degenerative neuropathies."
https://openalex.org/W2096280254,"Not only does 5-aza-2‘-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) induce the reexpression of silenced genes through the demethylation of CpG islands, but it increases the expression of unmethylated genes. However, the mechanism by which 5-aza-CdR activates the expression of genes is not completely understood. Here, we report that the pRb pocket proteins pRb, p107, and p130 were degraded in various cancer cell lines in response to 5-aza-CdR treatment, and this effect was dependent on the proteasome pathway. Mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) played a critical role in this 5-aza-CdR-induced degradation of pRb. Furthermore, PP2A phosphatase-induced MDM2 dephosphorylation at S260 was found to be essential for MDM2 binding to pRb in the presence of 5-aza-CdR. pRb degradation resulted in the significant reexpression of several genes, including methylated CDKN2A, RASFF1A, and unmethylated CDKN2D. Finally, knockdown of pRb pocket proteins by either RNAi or 5-aza-CdR treatment induced a significant decrease in the recruitment of SUV39H1 and an increase in the enrichment of KDM3B and KDM4A to histones around the promoter of RASFF1A and thus reduced H3K9 di- and trimethylation, by which RASFF1A expression is activated. Our data reveal a novel mechanism by which 5-aza-CdR induces the expression of both methylated and unmethylated genes by degrading pRb pocket proteins.—Zheng, Z., Li, L., Liu, X., Wang, D., Tu, B., Wang, L., Wang, H., Zhu, W.-G. 5-Aza-2‘-deoxycytidine reactivates gene expression via degradation of pRb pocket proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1965776698,"Background Dengue virus (DENV) enters cells via endocytosis, traffics to perinuclear (PN) region, the site of morphogenesis and exits by exocytosis. This study aims to understand the role of dynamin II, endosomes, microtubules (MT) and dynein in the early events of DENV replication. Findings Using double immunoflourescence labelling of DENV-2 infected BHK-21 cells it was observed that the surface envelope (E) protein of the virion associated with dynamin II from 0–30 min post infection (p.i.). The sphincter like array of dynamin II supported its pinchase-like activity. The association with endosomes was observed from 0 min at cell periphery to 30 min in the perinuclear (PN) region, suggesting that internalization continued for 30 min. Association of E protein with alpha-tubulin was observed from 8 h indicating that it was the newly translated protein that trafficked on the MT. Dynein was found to associate with the E protein from 4 h in the cytoplasm to 48 h in the PN region and dissociate at 72 h. Association of E protein with dynein was confirmed by immunoprecipitation. Overexpression of dynamitin, which disrupts the dynein complex, resulted in loss of trafficking of viral E and core proteins. The findings corroborated with the growth kinetics assessed by quantitation of viral RNA in infected BHK-21 cells. The detection of E protein at 4 h–8 h correlated with detectable increase in viral RNA from 8 h. The detection of high concentrations of E protein in the PN region at 24–48 h coincided with release of virus into the supernatant starting from 36 h p.i. The dissociation of dynein from E protein by 72 h was coincident with maximum release of virus, hinting at a possible negative feedback for viral protein translation. Conclusion The study shows for the first time the association of dynamin II with DENV-2 during entry and dynein dependent retrograde trafficking of DENV proteins on microtubules."

IntroductionCirculating concentrations of IgE, the antibody class responsible for allergic hypersensitivity, are linked to the development of several immunity-mediated diseases (1Ishizaka K. Ishizaka T. Hornbrook M.M. J. Immunol. 1966; 97: 840-853PubMed Google Scholar). IgE antibodies bound to their high affinity receptor (FcϵRI) on mast cells and basophils mediate receptor cross-linking by allergens and trigger degranulation and release of proinflammatory mediators responsible for immediate-type hypersensitivity reactions. However, the exact interplay of different isotypes with their cognate allergens remains enigmatic.Apart from the protein backbone, IgG and IgE may also be directed against xenobiotic and therefore immunogenic and cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) 3The abbreviations used are: CCDcross-reactive carbohydrate determinantα-Galα1,3-GalSTDsaturation transfer differencescFvsingle chain FvSPRsurface plasmon resonanceHSAhuman serum albuminMPBSmilk powder PBS. present on a plethora of proteins found in food, pollen, and hymenoptera venom (2Aalberse R.C. Akkerdaas J. van Ree R. Allergy. 2001; 56: 478-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The hallmark of classical CCDs are α1,3-linked core fucose residues found on insect venom allergens, and, additionally, β1,2-linked xylose on plant-derived CCDs. Antibody specificity for these spatially separated glycotopes represents the universal principle for reactivity of different proteins having CCDs (3Aalberse R.C. Koshte V. Clemens J.G. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1981; 68: 356-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The role of CCDs as a cause of allergic symptoms still is controversial (4Malandain H. Eur. Ann. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2005; 37: 122-128PubMed Google Scholar). IgE against classical CCDs has been shown to be clinically relevant (5Fotisch K. Altmann F. Haustein D. Vieths S. Int. Arch.

Clearly IgE-mediated anaphylaxis via the well established Gal-α1,3-Gal structure (α-Gal) as present on the chimeric therapeutic antibody cetuximab could be shown (11Chung C.H. Mirakhur B. Chan E.

Strong induction of α-Gal-specific IgE very recently was correlated with bites of tick species present within a restricted area of the United States (14Commins S.P. James H.R. Kelly L.A. Pochan S.L. Workman L.J. Perzanowski M.S. Kocan K.M. Fahy J.V. Nganga L.W. Ronmark E. Cooper P.J. Platts-Mills T.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2011; 127: 1286-1293.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar).Anti-Gal IgG antibodies, especially of the IgG2 subclass, constitute up to 3% of serum immunoglobulins in humans, are induced by commensal bacteria, and putatively exert a natural barrier function (15Yu P.B. Holzknecht Z.E. Bruno D. Parker W. Platt J.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5163-5168PubMed Google Scholar). Their clinical relevance is well documented for xenotransplantation and blood group antigens, providing α1,3-linked galactose residues, resulting in hyperacute xenograft rejection (16Macher B.A. Galili U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Scarce information however is available for α-Gal-specific IgE.The interaction of polyclonal IgE with allergens has broadly been studied, but detailed analyses of the particularities of IgE and its epitopes are hampered by two critical limitations, the low IgE levels in serum and the lack of specific human monoclonal antibodies. Murine monoclonals often used as substitute are neither compatible with human cellular assays nor recognize authentic IgE epitopes and thus can provide indirect evidence only.This limitation would be obsolete if murine antibodies recognized B-cell epitopes identical to those of human antibodies, a scenario only true for small sized epitopes that obey identical immunological mechanisms in animals and humans. Such a situation is presented for IgE with specificity for CCDs, which are defined by their high immunogenicity in different species and their spatially extraordinarily well defined architecture.Structural and molecular data on the interaction of antibodies with carbohydrates (17Cygler M.

Molecular analyses of biomolecules with ligands of limited size, such as carbohydrates, can be obtained using saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR (22Meyer B. Peters T. Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2003; 42: 864-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar). Thereby, saturation is transferred from a receptor protein to ligands and leads to specific attenuation of resonance signals of ligands that bind to the receptor. This attenuation is made visible by difference spectroscopy and allows identification and characterization of the ligands and their interaction.Thus, the aim of our work was to gain access to α-Gal-specific human antibody isotypes, allowing insights into the molecular and functional basis of their interaction. IgE and IgG were generated and employed for cellular activation tests and characterization of the IgE epitope by STD NMR. This work contributes to elucidation of the complex antibody carbohydrate interaction and molecular aspects in CCD-based anaphylaxis.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report the construction of chimeric immunoglobulins on the basis of an α-Gal-specific antibody fragment, their application in different assay systems, and their use to define the corresponding epitope on a molecular level. Against the background of α-Gal-mediated anaphylaxis and the relevance of α-Gal as a carbohydrate epitope, our study reveals for the first time direct molecular insights into the interaction.Generally, α1,3-Gal is considered of outstanding relevance in the context of xenotransplantation, development of biologicals, vaccine design, and reverse immunology. Consequently, specificity for α-Gal units has been assessed in different settings using a variety of reagents, including lectins, polyclonal sera, and monoclonal antibodies (32Diswall M. Gustafsson A. Holgersson J. Sandrin M.S. Breimer M.E. Xenotransplantation. 2011; 18: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite these data and recent theoretical approaches (33Agostino M. Sandrin M.S. Thompson P.E. Yuriev E. Ramsland P.A. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Agostino M. Sandrin M.S. Thompson P.E. Yuriev E. Ramsland P.A. Mol.

Cell Biol. 2007; 85: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), to the best of our knowledge, no direct structural data on the important α-Gal interaction with anti-Gal antibodies are available.In contrast to the beneficial role of α-Gal as natural barrier, its role in anaphylaxis mediated by α-Gal-specific IgE has been evolved very recently, and no IgE-based reagents have been established so far. In our study, the murine hybridoma clone M86 was chosen for conversion into human isotypes and further analyses. This antibody was established in mice after disruption of the corresponding galactosyltransferase, resembling the human system better than any other animal model (30Chiang T.R. Fanget L. Gregory R. Tang Y. Ardiet D.L. Gao L. Meschter C. Kozikowski A.P. Buelow R. Vuist W.M. Transplantation. 2000; 69: 2593-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Human/mouse chimeric IgG and IgE produced on the basis of this antibody therefore most likely mimic the specificities observed in humans and may act as a fundament for dissection of IgE-mediated α-Gal-based anaphylaxis. The immunoreactivity of the recombinant antibodies and the functional binding to the high affinity receptors FcϵRI and FcγRI generally verify their applicability in various types of immunological and allergy diagnostic backgrounds.Although IgE generally is hypothesized as a highly affinity-matured isotype, controversy exists regarding the particular affinities of allergen-specific IgE and IgG antibodies and their physiological relevance (36Fromberg J. Allergy. 2006; 611234Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast to protein-specific antibodies, however, carbohydrate-specific antibodies mostly exhibit low to medium affinities, a finding that holds true for most lectins often exhibiting affinities in the micromolar range. Although some hints exist (37Jin C. Hantusch B. Hemmer W. Stadlmann J. Altmann F. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2008; 121: 185-190.e2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), it remains unknown if IgE antibodies exhibit higher affinities in contrast to all other known carbohydrate binding structures.The recombinant IgE generated in our study exhibited reasonable affinities as shown by SPR analyses. The real affinity, however, is difficult to assess due to the valence effects of both the bivalent antibodies and the multivalent α-Gal proteins. Anti-Gal antibodies in humans are reported to have affinities in the range of 10−5 to 10−6 m (38McKenzie I.F. Patton K. Smit J.A. Mouhtouris E. Xing P. Myburgh J.A. Sandrin M.S. Transplantation. 1999; 67: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is inferior to or parallels the M86 antibody in our setting.Here we could show that the recombinant IgE was unable to mediate basophil degranulation in the presence of multivalent α-Gal. Although the architecture of the α-Gal epitope and its availability on the surface of different carriers might affect the capability of effector cell activation, limited affinities of allergen-specific IgE can significantly decrease basophil sensitivity (39Christensen L.H. Holm J. Lund G. Riise E. Lund K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2008; 122: 298-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that class switching of preexisting IgG or IgM to IgE does not explain the anaphylactic reaction associated with α-Gal. It will be crucial and representative for all CCDs to demonstrate if anaphylaxis-mediating IgE have undergone affinity maturation processes.On the other hand, the lack of α-Gal-dependent mediator release might also reflect the delay in anaphylactic symptoms observed for α-Gal-based allergy (12Commins S.P. Satinover S.M. Hosen J. Mozena J. Borish L. Lewis B.D. Woodfolk J.A. Platts-Mills T.A. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2009; 123: 426-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). This interpretation is favored by the fact that the murine C38-2 IgE, also of medium affinity, exhibits clear-cut cellular activation upon stimulation with a multivalent conjugate. The mechanisms underlying this retardation are the subject of speculation but now will become discernible with the antibodies generated in this study.The structural basis of IgE B cell epitopes on allergens has been assessed by a variety of approaches (40Gehlhar K.

The most direct evidence for epitope analyses so far is the determination of crystal structures of antibody-allergen complexes. Although at first realized using murine antibodies (42Li M.

As a result, only two structures of allergen-IgE complexes are available so far (45Niemi M. Jylhä S. Laukkanen M.L. Söderlund H. Mäkinen-Kiljunen S. Kallio J.M. Hakulinen N. Haahtela T. Takkinen K.

A peculiarity of anti-CCD antibodies is that effectual epitope is constituted by the carbohydrate itself and that it is closely related in humans and other animals. α-Gal thus represents an authentic IgE epitope, rendering this particular antibody-allergen interaction a bonanza for molecular analyses. Hence, we used a chimeric monoclonal IgE to dissect the human IgE and IgG epitopes of α-Gal by STD NMR. This technique is essentially based on the dynamics of the interaction in which the nuclear Overhauser effect is transferred to ligand residues essentially involved in binding. Differences in the free and bound state thus enable fine mapping of the interaction in a richness of detail comparable with x-ray structures only.To our knowledge, this is the first STD NMR-based epitope mapping of an IgE epitope and one of the first examples of a human carbohydrate B cell epitope. Only two studies on carbohydrates are available that focus on the human IgG antibody 2G12 against HIV glycostructures (47Enríquez-Navas P.M. Marradi M. Padro D. Angulo J. Penadés S.

By deciphering the paratope-inherent information of the M86-based IgE using STD NMR, we assigned the IgE epitope primarily to the two galactose units and, to a weaker extent, to the residues downstream of the Gal-Gal unit for both the monoclonal IgE and the polyclonal immunoglobulins affinity-purified using an α-Gal carrier protein.Although we have depicted the protons with relative STD effects of more than 50% only, most protons show limited STD effects. This phenomenon arises due to spin diffusion throughout the ligand and should be considered irrelevant without further evidence. Hence, only the protons with medium to strong effects represent carbohydrate positions important for interaction. The epitope, as suggested from the STD NMR data, is primarily comprised by the H2, H3, and H4 protons of the terminal galactose and the H3, H4, H5, and H6 protons for the adjacent galactose (H1, H2, and H4 for the human serum).Generally, the somewhat more pronounced signals evident for the terminal galactose suggest a stronger implication in the carbohydrate-antibody interaction, a fact that is in good accordance with an end-on binding mode reported for glycan-specific binding molecules and relevance of the 1,3-linkage, which is crucial for recognition. Nevertheless, the adjacent galactose is also essentially involved in the interaction. The STD effect on the terminal OMe group is insignificant, reflecting the minor contributions of the third sugar moiety. This moiety is postulated to only modulate binding, although it is crucial for some carbohydrate binding proteins and antibodies. Human serum, however, also shows pronounced reactivity for the Gal-Gal disaccharide, indicating that the underlying principle is the recognition of the galactose dimer. It will be interesting, however, to assess the interaction of anti-Gal antibodies using a broad panel of other carbohydrates.Of particular interest is the finding that the interaction foot print of human serum, in contrast to the monoclonal IgE, does not show significant signals for the H6 protons. With STD effects of ∼45%, these protons most likely do not contribute in a significant manner. Lowering the cut-off, however, might suggest additional contributions but would weaken the overall reliability of the interaction footprint.According to recent combined mapping and docking studies of α-Gal carbohydrates together with binding sites of monoclonal antibodies (34Agostino M. Sandrin M.S. Thompson P.E. Yuriev E. Ramsland P.A. Mol. Immunol. 2009; 47: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the C6 positions of the carbohydrate play a prominent role by contributing to hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions, and the O6 positions contribute to hydrogen bonding (33Agostino M. Sandrin M.S. Thompson P.E. Yuriev E. Ramsland P.A. Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 724-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Whether the weaker contributions of the H6 protons and the slight variances between monoclonal and serum-derived immunoglobulins as suggested by our STD data reflect methodological differences in in silico approaches or true differences in recognition remains to be elucidated.Notably, the STD epitope of our antibodies with the terminal galactose resembles that of the 120-kDa lectin Ricinus communis agglutinin I with methyl-β-galactoside showing nearly identical distribution of STD effects with H3, H2, and H4 as most prominent protons (55Mayer M. Meyer B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 6108-6117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Additionally, this epitope has also been reported in STD NMR and crystallographic studies for the galactose binding Viscum album lectin VAA (56Mikeska R. Wacker R. Arni R. Singh T.P. Mikhailov A. Gabdoulkhakov A. Voelter W. Betzel C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2005; 61: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 57Martín-Santamaría S. André S. Buzamet E.

Chem. 2011; 9: 5445-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similarly, galectin-1 as well as VAA could be shown to interact predominantly with the non-reducing terminus of digalactosides (58Miller M.C. Ribeiro J.P. Roldos V. Martin-Santamaria S. Canada F.J. Nesmelova I. Andre S. Pang M. Klyosov A. Baum L.G. Jimenez-Barbero J. Gabius H.J. Mayo K.H. Glycobiology. 2011; (in press)Google Scholar).The binding mode appears roughly in accordance with that of other α-Gal-specific proteins, such as the Marasmius oreades (MOA) mushroom lectin, the only lectin with pronounced specificity for the α-Gal epitope. The crystal structure reveals that the carbohydrate binding site forms an shallow groove on the surface (31Grahn E. Askarieh G. Holmner A. Tateno H. Winter H.C. Goldstein I.J. Krengel U. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 59Grahn E.M. Winter H.C. Tateno H. Goldstein I.J. Krengel U. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 390: 457-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in which the protein exhibits contacts with the terminal and the adjacent galactose residue. Consequently, both galactose units are relatively tightly bound compared with the GlcNAc unit at the reducing end of the sugar. In contrast, the Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin GS I-B4 forms a deep pocket favoring the recognition of terminal galactose and thus broader specificity (60Tempel W. Tschampel S. Woods R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6615-6621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The fact that the MOA accepts the fucosylated blood group antigen B, whereas the M86 antibody does not, is the best evidence for their different binding pocket structures.Moreover, in a recent STD NMR-based analysis of bovine norovirus with the α-Gal epitope, the interaction map shows clear similarities to our antibody-derived map (61Zakhour M. Ruvoën-Clouet N. Charpilienne A. Langpap B. Poncet D. Peters T. Bovin N. Le Pendu J. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5e1000504Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This interaction, however, is completely abolished by an additional GlcNAc at the reducing end. Obviously, the recognition of the two galactose units is key for specific interaction, but the involvement of other parts of potential carbohydrate ligands and thus additional mechanisms of binding might differ significantly between different proteins.The surprisingly similar interaction footprint of human serum containing anti-Gal IgE verified that the immune system in α1,3-galactosyltransferase knockout mice responds to xenobiotic structures in a manner comparable with humans and that the recognition mechanisms in humans are relatively uniform. This is of particular relevance because the anti-Gal IgE leading to cetuximab-based anaphylaxis might either represent independent clones with unique properties or derive from medium affinity IgM or IgG subjected to affinity maturation. In light of our finding, the first explanation might appear more convincing. On the other hand, the anti-Gal antibodies purified from serum using thyroglobulin affinity chromatography clearly show pronounced reactivity for cetuximab. Further studies of IgE derived from patients with cetuximab-based anaphylaxis, however, are needed to address this point in detail.Moreover, the recognition of the α-Gal epitope by nature clearly contradicts the hypothesis deduced from crystal structures with proteins that IgE epitopes are preferably defined by large surface areas comprising several structural elements (45Niemi M.

During brain development, CRMPs are essentially involved in signaling of axon guidance and neurite outgrowth, but their functions in the adult brain remain largely unknown. CRMP5 has been initially identified as the target of auto-antibodies involved in paraneoplasic neurological diseases and further implicated in a neurite outgrowth inhibition mediated by tubulin binding. Interestingly, CRMP5 is also highly expressed in adult brain neurogenic areas where its functions have not yet been elucidated. Here we observed in both neurogenic areas of the adult mouse brain that CRMP5 was present in proliferating and post-mitotic neuroblasts, while they migrate and differentiate into mature neurons. In CRMP5−/− mice, the lack of CRMP5 resulted in a significant increase of proliferation and neurogenesis, but also in an excess of apoptotic death of granule cells in the OB and DG. These findings provide the first evidence that CRMP5 is involved in the generation and survival of newly generated neurons in areas of the adult brain with a high level of activity-dependent neuronal plasticity."

As one of the most important histone acetyltransferases, general control non-derepressible (Gcn) 5 has been linked to diverse cellular processes and tumorigenesis as well. We have recently identified a functional link between Gcn5 and acidic nucleoplasmic DNA-binding protein 1 (And-1) that is elevated in multiple cancer cells and is essential for Gcn5 protein stability. However, the mechanism by which And-1 regulates Gcn5 protein stability remains unknown. Here we show that the ablation of Cullin4-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase (CRL4) leads to the stabilization of Gcn5 in cells with depleted And-1, and Cdc10-dependent transcript 2 (Cdt2) serves as a substrate receptor protein of CRL4. Overexpression of Cdt2 reduces the Gcn5 protein levels, and CRLCdt2 is sufficient to ubiquitinate Gcn5 both in vivo and in vitro. And-1 stabilizes Gcn5 by impairing the interaction between Gcn5 and CRLCdt2 and thereby preventing Gcn5 ubiquitination and degradation. The degradation of Gcn5 is not dependent on proliferating cell nuclear antigen, an important player involved in CRLCdt2-mediated protein degradation.

Due to its important roles in oncogenic expression and histone acetylation (13Nagy Z. Tora L.

Cell Cycle. 2010; 9: 2979-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the pathway that regulates Gcn5 protein levels remains unknown. We have recently identified a novel high-mobility group (HMG) protein acidic nucleoplasmic DNA-binding protein 1 (And-1) that is critical for the stability of Gcn5 and histone H3 acetylation (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar). Intriguingly, And-1 expression is significantly increased in multiple cancer cells in a manner correlating with increased Gcn5 and acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) and lysine 56 (H3K56) (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar). Thus, the functional link between Gcn5 and And-1 may provide us with a new target for cancer therapy by altering Gcn5 protein stability. For instance, we can alter histone acetylation in cancer cells by manipulating Gcn5 protein stability. To accomplish this goal, it is necessary and important to elucidate the mechanism by which And-1 stabilizes Gcn5.

For instance, during S phase of DNA replication or in cells with genotoxic stresses, CRLCdt2 is critical to promote the degradation of Cdc10-dependent transcript 1 (Cdt1), a DNA replication “licensing” factor required for the assembly of minichromosome maintenance protein 2–7 (MCM2–7) complex to replication origins in G1 phase (22Jin J.

The degradation of Cdt1 by CRLCdt2 during S phase is one of the important mechanisms to prevent DNA re-replication. CRL4Cdt2 also targets the degradation of CDK inhibitor p21 during S phase or in response to UV irradiation (28Abbas T. Sivaprasad U. Terai K. Amador V. Pagano M. Dutta A.

Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2507-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Recent studies showed that CRLCdt2 regulates chromatin compaction by targeting histone methyltransferase Set8 (also known as Pr-Set7) for degradation during S phase or in cells with DNA damage (30Abbas T.

Furthermore, CRLCdt2 regulates the termination of the translesion synthesis repair pathway by promoting the degradation of translesion synthesis polymerase η and the normal cell cycle progression by promoting degradation of E2F1 (33Kim S.H. Michael W.M. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 757-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 34Shibutani S.T. de la Cruz A.F. Tran V. Turbyfill 3rd, W.J. Reis T.

Although these CRLCdt2 targets are involved in distinct cellular processes, all of them contain a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-interacting protein motif (PIP box), and PCNA appears to be required for the degradation of these CRLCdt2 targets (24Abbas T. Dutta A. Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify a novel functional link between CRLCdt2 and And-1 that has the remarkable capability to regulate Gcn5 protein turnover. We find that the down-regulation of CRLCdt2 leads to the stabilization of Gcn5 in cells with depleted And-1. Overexpression of CRLCdt2 reduces the Gcn5 protein levels, and CRLCdt2 is sufficient to ubiquitinate Gcn5 both in vivo and in vitro. And-1 and CRLCdt2 associate with Gcn5 at the same sites, and And-1 prevents the ubiquitination of Gcn5 by impairing the interaction between Gcn5 and CRLCdt2. Surprisingly, PCNA is not required for the degradation of Gcn5 in the absence of And-1, consistent with the fact that Gcn5 does not interact with PCNA. Thus, the functional link between And-1 and CRLCdt2 is critical for Gcn5 protein stability, and this study provides us with the mechanistic basis to target Gcn5 protein stability and thereby histone acetylation for cancer therapy.

The plasmids expressing truncated Gcn5 were constructed as below; fragments of Gcn5 encoding amino acids 492–666, 667–749, 750–837, 492–706, and 707–749 were PCR-amplified using primers containing SpeI and KpnI sites, digested with SpeI and KpnI, and ligated into pEFF-vector digested with SpeI and KpnI. The in vivo immunoprecipitations were performed as follows. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH at pH 7.6, 150 mm KAc, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na2 EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor, supplemented with 300 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and 15 killiunits/ml DNase I) for 20 min on ice followed by sonication. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatants were mixed with antibody or pre-bleed for immunoprecipitation overnight (2 h for FLAG-tagged protein immunoprecipitations) followed by incubation with protein G/A beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h. Beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer. Associated proteins were eluted by incubating beads with SDS loading buffer for immunoblotting. Details of the in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination reactions were as described (28Abbas T. Sivaprasad U. Terai K. Amador V. Pagano M. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2496-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). For the in vivo reaction, U2OS cells were transiently transfected with either FLAG-Gcn5 ± HA-ubiquitin ± FLAG-And-1-expressing or FLAG-Cdt2-expressing plasmids. Forty hours after transfection, the cells were treated with MG132 (20 μg/ml) for 2 h prior to lysis. Immunoprecipitated ubiquitinated proteins or FLAG-Gcn5 were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for the indicated proteins. For the in vitro reaction, FLAG-Gcn5 and FLAG-And-1 proteins as well as FLAG-Cdt2 protein complexes were immunopurified from 293T cells expressing the above proteins from mammalian expression plasmids. siRNA oligonucleotides And-1-1 and And-1-2 were as described previously (36Zhu W.

The sequences for siAnd-1-1 and siAnd-1-2 oligonucleotides were as described previously (36Zhu W. Ukomadu C. Jha S. Senga T. Dhar S.K. Wohlschlegel J.A. Nutt L.K. Kornbluth S. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 2288-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The sequences for siPCNA were as described before (27Senga T. Sivaprasad U. Zhu W. Park J.H. Arias E.E. Walter J.C. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6246-6252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The sequences for siCdt2 and siDDB1 were as described before (28Abbas T. Sivaprasad U. Terai K. Amador V. Pagano M. Dutta A. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2496-2506Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). siRNA transfections were performed with 100 nm siRNA oligonucleotide duplexes using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To make total protein, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1.0% IGEPAL® CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) followed by sonication. Histone extraction was performed as described previously (37Shechter D. Dormann H.L. Allis C.D. Hake S.B. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). We previously observed that And-1 depletion resulted in the degradation of Gcn5 in HCT116 cells (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar). To test whether this is the case in other cells, we examined Gcn5 protein levels in HeLa and U2OS cells in which And-1 was depleted by siRNA. The endogenous levels of And-1 protein were efficiently depleted after treatment by two independent siRNAs (siAnd-1-1 and siAnd-1-2) as compared with cells treated with control siRNA (siGl2) that targets firefly luciferase (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous observations in HCT116 cells (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar), Gcn5 protein levels and the acetylation of histone H3K9 and H3K56 were decreased in two cell lines treated by two independent siRNAs (Fig. 1A). Thus, the maintenance of Gcn5 protein stability by And-1 is not restricted to HCT116 cells. Given that And-1 depletion reduces Gcn5 protein levels but does not affect its mRNA levels (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar), we hypothesized that Gcn5 might be degraded via ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway. To test this idea, we treated siRNA transfected cells with protease inhibitor MG132. Consistently, And-1 depletion caused the degradation of Gcn5 (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, the addition of MG132 to And-1-depleted cells resulted in the stabilization of Gcn5 proteins (Fig. 1B), indicating that degradation of Gcn5 is mediated by the proteasome pathway. Degradation of proteins by the proteasome depends on conjugation of ubiquitin to the target protein. To determine whether Gcn5 is ubiquitinated in vivo, U2OS cells were co-transfected with a HA-tagged ubiquitin construct (HA-ubiquitin) and FLAG-Gcn5. Ubiquitinated proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 1C, slower migrating ubiquitin conjugates of Gcn5 were detected specifically in the HA-ubiquitin and FLAG-Gcn5 co-transfected cells. Notably, the presence of multiple slower migrating forms of Gcn5 indicates that Gcn5 is polyubiquitinated in vivo (Fig. 1C). Taken together, our data show that Gcn5 is ubiquitinated in vivo and that the degradation of Gcn5 in the absence of And-1 is mediated by the proteasome pathway. The fact that Gcn5 is ubiquitinated in vivo and is degraded via the proteasome pathway in the absence of And-1 prompted us to identify the E3 ligases that target Gcn5 for proteolysis. To this end, we searched for the E3 ligases that interact with Gcn5. Strikingly, DDB1 was previously found to interact with SPT3-TAFII31-GCN5L acetylase (STAGA) complex containing Gcn5 (38Martinez E. Palhan V.B. Tjernberg A. Lymar E.S. Gamper A.M. Kundu T.K. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6782-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar); however, the biological function of this interaction is unclear. As an adaptor protein, DDB1 forms a complex with Cul4, which serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase targeting numerous proteins for proteolysis (39Jackson S. Xiong Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 562-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Given that Gcn5 is degraded by the proteasome pathway (Fig. 1B), we hypothesized that Cul4-DDB1 E3 ligase might be involved in the degradation of Gcn5 in the absence of And-1. To test this idea, we examined whether Gcn5 interacts physically with DDB1. We expressed FLAG-tagged full-length Gcn5 and FLAG-Gcn5 mutants (1–491) or (492–837) in human 293T cells and monitored the presence of DDB1 in the anti-FLAG precipitates. Consistently with previous observation (38Martinez E. Palhan V.B. Tjernberg A. Lymar E.S. Gamper A.M. Kundu T.K. Chait B.T. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6782-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), endogenous DDB1 was detected in full-length Gcn5 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2A), indicating that DDB1 forms a complex with Gcn5. Furthermore, we detected DDB1 in the precipitates of Gcn5 mutant (492–837) but not Gcn5 mutant (1–491), suggesting that the C terminus of Gcn5 is required for the association of Gcn5 with DDB1. This interaction is unlikely to be indirect due to DNA associations because both DNase and ethidium bromide were included in the lysis buffer for co-immunoprecipitation assays. Thus, our data indicate that Gcn5 associates with DDB1. Given that DDB1 forms a complex with Cul4 in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (39Jackson S. Xiong Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 562-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), we next asked whether Cul4-DDB1 E3 ligase is associated with Gcn5. To test this idea, we examined the interaction between Cul4A and Gcn5. Strikingly, like DDB1, Cul4A was detected in the immunoprecipitates of full-length FLAG-Gcn5 and Gcn5 mutant (492–837) but not Gcn5 mutant (1–491) (Fig. 2A). Cdt2 is a substrate receptor protein that usually forms a complex with Cul4 and DDB1 to target proteins for degradation (24Abbas T. Dutta A. Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We therefore predicted that Gcn5 might interact with Cdt2. Indeed, Cdt2 could be detected in immunoprecipitates of full-length Gcn5 (Fig. 2A). Like DDB1 and Cul4A, Cdt2 was detected in the precipitates of Gcn5 mutant (492–837) but not Gcn5 mutant (1–491) (Fig. 2A). Taken together, our data show that Gcn5 associates with CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase complex and that the C terminus of Gcn5 is required for this association. Our recent study showed that And-1 interacts with Gcn5 (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar). We next assessed which part of Gcn5 interacts with And-1. Like CRL4Cdt2, And-1 was detected in the immunoprecipitates of full-length FLAG-Gcn5 and Gcn5 mutant (492–837) but not Gcn5 mutant (1–491) (Fig. 2A), suggesting that And-1 associates with the C terminus of Gcn5. Because Gcn5 interacts with both And-1 and CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase, we next asked whether And-1 also interacts with Cdt2. To this end, we examined the interaction between And-1 and Cdt2 in 293T cells overexpressing vector or FLAG-And-1. Although Gcn5 was detected in FLAG-And-1 precipitates, Cdt2 was not detected in FLAG-And-1 immunoprecipitates, suggesting that And-1 does not interact with CRL4Cdt2. The fact that Gcn5 interacts with both And-1 and CRL4Cdt2, whereas And-1 does not associate with Cdt2, suggests that Gcn5 may interact with either And-1 or Cdt2 exclusively. Having found the interactions between Gcn5 and CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase complex, we hypothesized that CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase is involved in the degradation of Gcn5 in the absence of And-1. To test this idea, we used siRNA to knock down the component of this E3 ubiquitin ligase in And-1-depleted cells. As compared with cells transfected with siGl2, cells co-transfected with siAnd-1 and siGl2 exhibited reduced Gcn5 protein levels (Fig. 3A). However, Gcn5 proteins were recovered in cells co-transfected with siAnd-1 and siCdt2 (Fig. 3A). In agreement, in cells co-transfected with siDDB1 and siAnd-1, the reduced Gcn5 protein levels were also partially recovered as compared with levels in cells co-transfected with siAnd-1 and siGl2 (Fig. 3B). Thus, CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase is required for the degradation of Gcn5 induced by depletion of And-1. To further explore the role of CRL4Cdt2 in the degradation of Gcn5, we next explored whether CRL4Cdt2 is sufficient to down-regulate Gcn5 in vivo. To this end, we overexpressed Cdt2 in U2OS cells and examined Gcn5 proteins. Notably, overexpression of Cdt2 specifically decreased the Gcn5 protein levels by immunoblot analyses (Fig. 3C). To confirm this observation, we performed indirect immunofluorescence in U2OS cells with expressed FLAG-Cdt2. As shown in Fig. 3D, cells expressing FLAG-Cdt2 exhibited lower levels of Gcn5 as indicated by reduced Gcn5 fluorescent signal as compared with that in cells without overexpression of FLAG-Cdt2. Taken together, our data suggest that CRL4Cdt2 is sufficient to induce the degradation of Gcn5 in vivo. PCNA has been shown to be required for CRL4Cdt2-mediated degradation of several target proteins such as Cdt1, p21, Set8, and polymerase η (24Abbas T. Dutta A. Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). All these proteins bind to PCNA through a PIP box and are degraded on chromatin in a PCNA- and CRL4Cdt2-dependent manner (24Abbas T. Dutta A. Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gcn5 does not contain a PIP box. We therefore assumed that Gcn5 is unable to bind to PCNA. To test this possibility, we expressed FLAG-Gcn5 in 293T cells and monitored for the presence of PCNA in FLAG-Gcn5 precipitates. Consistent with our previous observation (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar), we could detect And-1 from FLAG-Gcn5 precipitates (Fig. 4A). However, PCNA was not detected from FLAG-Gcn5 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A). We also failed to detect PCNA from endogenous Gcn5 precipitates (Fig. 4A). Taken together, Gcn5 does not exist in a complex with PCNA. Given that Gcn5 is not associated with PCNA, we hypothesized that PCNA might not be involved in the degradation of Gcn5 in the absence of And-1. To test this idea, we co-transfected siAnd-1 and siPCNA and compared the Gcn5 protein levels in co-transfected cells with levels in And-1-depleted cells. Although PCNA protein is depleted in cells co-transfected with siAnd-1 and siPCNA, PCNA depletion had little effect on Gcn5 protein levels in co-transfected cells as compared with And-1-depleted cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, our data indicate that Gcn5 does not associate with PCNA and that PCNA is dispensable for the CRL4Cdt2-dependent degradation of Gcn5 in the absence of And-1. To assess whether Gcn5 is a bona fide substrate of CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase, we overexpressed Cdt2 along with the FLAG-Gcn5 and HA-ubiquitin in U2OS cells. To prevent the degradation of Gcn5 by Cdt2 overexpression, MG132 was added to cells before harvest. Gcn5 ubiquitination was detected in cells co-expressed with HA-ubiquitin and FLAG-Gcn5 (Fig. 5A, lane 1). Notably, Cdt2 overexpression enhanced Gcn5 polyubiquitination (Fig. 5A, lane 2), indicating that CRL4Cdt2 is able to ubiquitinate Gcn5 in vivo. We next asked whether the CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase is capable of ubiquitinating Gcn5 in vitro. To this end, we purified FLAG-Cdt2 complexes and FLAG-And-1 from 293T cells, respectively. The incubation of FLAG-Cdt2 complexes with E2 and Gcn5 produced high-molecular weight ubiquitinated Gcn5 species (Fig. 5C, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, Gcn5 is a bona fide direct substrate of CRL4Cdt2 ubiquitin ligase. We have previously shown that the interaction between And-1 and Gcn5 is critical for And-1 to maintain the stability of Gcn5 (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar). Given that Gcn5 is degraded via the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation pathway, we hypothesized that And-1 might stabilize Gcn5 proteins by preventing Gcn5 ubiquitination. To test this idea, we co-expressed HA-ubiquitin together with Gcn5 or with Gcn5 and And-1, respectively, in U2OS cells. Consistent with our previous observation (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar), And-1 overexpression elevated the FLAG-Gcn5 protein levels in the whole cell extracts (Fig. 5B). Gcn5 was polyubiquitinated in cells co-expressing FLAG-Gcn5 and HA-ubiquitin (Fig. 5B, lane 2). Strikingly, co-expression of And-1 with Gcn5 significantly reduced ubiquitination of Gcn5 (Fig. 5B, lane 3), suggesting that And-1 interferes with the Gcn5 ubiquitination. To further confirm this observation, we next performed in vitro ubiquitination assays. As shown in Fig. 5C, FLAG-Cdt2 complexes were able to ubiquitinate Gcn5 (Fig. 5C, lane 2); however, the addition of purified FLAG-And-1 substantially reduced the ubiquitination of Gcn5 (Fig. 5C, lane 3). Taken together, our data show that And-1 prevents Gcn5 ubiquitination by CRL4Cdt2 both in vivo and in vitro. Gcn5 interacts with CRL4Cdt2 via its C terminus (492–837) (Fig. 2A). We predicted that CRL4Cdt2 may ubiquitinate Gcn5 at its C terminus (492–837). To test this idea, we co-expressed FLAG-Gcn5(1–491) or FLAG-Gcn5(492–837) with HA-ubiquitin or vector. As expected, FLAG-Gcn5(492–837) but not FLAG-Gcn5(1–491) was detected with ubiquitination (Fig. 5D), suggesting that the C terminus of Gcn5 contains ubiquitin sites. Because And-1 also interacts with FLAG-Gcn5(492–837), it is possible that overexpression of And-1 may impair the ubiquitination of FLAG-Gcn5(492–837). Indeed, overexpression of And-1 substantially reduced the ubiquitination of FLAG-Gcn5(492–837) (Fig. 5D). Thus, Gcn5 ubiquitin sites are located within the C terminus of Gcn5 that is the binding site for both And-1 and CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase. We have previously reported that the interaction between Gcn5 and And-1 is critical for And-1 to maintain the stability of Gcn5 (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar). Given that C terminus of Gcn5 interacts with both And-1 and CRL4Cdt2, whereas And-1 does not interact with Cdt2 (Fig. 2), we hypothesized that And-1 might compete with Cdt2 for the interaction with Gcn5 at the same site or adjacent sites at the C terminus of Gcn5. To explore this possibility, we constructed a series of truncated Gcn5 mutants to delineate the And-1 and CRL4Cdt2 binding regions within Gcn5 (Fig. 6A). Because both And-1 and CRL4Cdt2 interact with the C terminus of Gcn5 (Fig. 2A), all of the Gcn5 truncation mutants excluded the N-terminal regions of Gcn5 (Fig. 6A). We expressed these Gcn5 mutants in 293T cells and examined their interactions with And-1 or Cdt2 by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Consistent with previous observations (Fig. 2A), Cdt2 was not detected in FLAG-Gcn5(1–491) precipitates. We failed to detect Cdt2 from precipitates of Gcn5 mutant (492–666), suggesting that Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase domain is not required for the association of Gcn5 with Cdt2. Notably, Cdt2 was readily detected in precipitates of Gcn5 mutants (Gcn5(492–706), Gcn5(707–749), Gcn5(750–837), and Gcn5(667–749)) (Fig. 6B), suggesting that the region between 667 and 837 of Gcn5 was the binding site for Cdt2. The stronger association between Cdt2 and Gcn5(667–749) or Gcn5(707–749) indicates that the major site on Gcn5 for the association with Cdt2 is located within the region between amino acids 667–749. In agreement, similar interaction patterns were observed between DDB1 and Gcn5 truncation mutants (Fig. 6B). Strikingly, And-1 was also detected in the precipitates of Gcn5 mutants (Gcn5(492–706), Gcn5(707–749), Gcn5(750–837), or Gcn5(667–749)). Like Cdt2 and DDB1, And-1 also exhibited a stronger interaction with Gcn5(667–749) or Gcn5(707–749). Taken together, our data show that both And-1 and CRL4Cdt2 complexes associate with Gcn5 at the same site within the region of 667–749. Given that And-1 and CRL4Cdt2 complexes interact with Gcn5 at the same site and that And-1 does not interact with Cdt2, it is possible that And-1 and Cdt2 may compete with each other for the interaction with Gcn5. To explore this possibility, we examined the interaction between Gcn5 and Cdt2 in And-1-depleted cells. If our hypothesis is correct, And-1 depletion should result in an increased interaction between Gcn5 and Cdt2. Indeed, the interaction between Gcn5 and Cdt2 was substantially increased in the absence of And-1 (Fig. 6C). Consistently, And-1 blocked the interaction between Cdt2 and Gcn5 in an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay (Fig. 6D). Taken together, our data suggest that And-1 prevents the interaction between CRL4Cdt2 and Gcn5. We have previously shown that And-1 has remarkable capability to regulate the stability of Gcn5 proteins and thereby histone H3 acetylation (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism by which And-1 maintains the stability of Gcn5, we identified a novel functional link between CRL4Cdt2 and And-1 that is critical to regulate Gcn5 protein turnover. We find that CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase complexes target Gcn5 for degradation in the absence of And-1. Both And-1 and Cdt2 bind to the C terminus of Gcn5 (Fig. 7). Although Gcn5 interacts with And-1 and CRL4Cdt2, And-1 and CRL4Cdt2 do not exist in the same complex, and And-1 prevents the interaction between CRL4Cdt2 and Gcn5. CRL4Cdt2 is sufficient to ubiquitinate Gcn5 both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, we conclude that And-1 stabilizes the Gcn5 protein by preventing the association of Gcn5 with CRL4Cdt2 and subsequently the ubiquitination and degradation of Gcn5 (Fig. 7). This discovery explains our previous observation that the interaction between And-1 and Gcn5 is required for And-1 to maintain Gcn5 protein stability (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar). CRL4Cdt2 regulates the degradation of multiple cell cycle-regulating proteins (24Abbas T. Dutta A. Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our study indicates that Gcn5 is a new bona fide target of CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase. This conclusion is based on three solid lines of evidence. First, CRL4Cdt2 interacts with Gcn5 (Fig. 2). Second, CRL4Cdt2 promotes the ubiquitination of Gcn5 both in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 2). Finally, silencing Cdt2 or DDB1 rescues the degradation of Gcn5 in And-1-depleted cells (Fig. 3). Intriguingly, CRL4Cdt2 recently was shown to be involved in chromatin modification by promoting the destruction of histone methyltransferase Set8 in S phase, a process that prevents aberrant chromatin compaction during DNA synthesis (30Abbas T. Shibata E. Park J. Jha S. Karnani N. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 9-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 31Centore R.C. Havens C.G. Manning A.L. Li J.M. Flynn R.L. Tse A. Jin J. Dyson N.J. Walter J.C. Zou L. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 22-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 32Oda H. Hübner M.R. Beck D.B. Vermeulen M. Hurwitz J. Spector D.L. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 364-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Thus, CRL4Cdt2 appears to be an important player that regulates chromatin structure and function via the regulation of proteins involved in histone modification. It remains unclear how CRL4Cdt2 regulates cell cycle progression by maintaining the balance between the histone acetyltransferase and histone methyltransferase. PCNA plays a critical role in the CRL4Cdt2-mediated degradation pathway. CRL4Cdt2 targets such as Cdt1, p21, Set8, and polymerase η contain a conserved PIP box, which is required for CRL4Cdt2-mediated degradation (24Abbas T. Dutta A. Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Gcn5 does not contain a PIP box and does not interact with PCNA. In support of this, silencing of PCNA fails to rescue degradation of Gcn5 in And-1-depleted cells (Fig. 4). Thus, PCNA is dispensable for Gcn5 degradation in the absence of And-1. Why is PCNA dispensable in CRL4Cdt2-mediated degradation of Gcn5 in the absence of And-1? One possible explanation is that Gcn5 physically associates with CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase complexes and that the ubiquitination of Gcn5 by CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase does not need PCNA as a platform. Indeed, we could detect an interaction between Gcn5 and CRL4Cdt2 complexes, and this interaction is substantially increased in the absence of And-1 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6). Thus, Gcn5 is ubiquitinated by CRL4Cdt2 E3 ligase immediately upon loss of its interacting protector And-1. Further experiments with careful examination of chromatin structure in the absence of And-1 will be needed to determine how Gcn5 is targeted by CRL4Cdt2 without PCNA as a docking site. We have reported that And-1 protein is overexpressed in multiple cancer cells in a manner correlating with increased Gcn5 and acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 and 56 (19Li Y. Jaramillo-Lambert A. Yang Y. Williams R. Lee N. Zhu W. Oncogene. July 4, 2011; 10.1038/onc.2011.261Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cdt2 expression is also elevated in aggressive hepatocellular carcinomas and breast and gastric cancers (40Pan H.W. Chou H.Y. Liu S.H. Peng S.Y. Liu C.L. Hsu H.C. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2676-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 41Ueki T. Nishidate T. Park J.H. Lin M.L. Shimo A. Hirata K. Nakamura Y. Katagiri T. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5672-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 42Li J. Ng E.K. Ng Y.P. Wong C.Y. Yu J. Jin H. Cheng V.Y. Go M.Y. Cheung P.K. Ebert M.P. Tong J. To K.F. Chan F.K. Sung J.J. Ip N.Y. Leung W.K. Br. J. Cancer. 2009; 101: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). How the elevated functional link between And-1 and Cdt2 contributes to the tumorigenesis is unclear. In fact, our study indicates that the disruption of the balance between And-1 and Cdt2 significantly alters Gcn5 protein levels. One possibility is that And-1 and Cdt2 maintain a physiological level of Gcn5 that is critical for cancer cell proliferation or survival. Given that Gcn5 plays an important role in the regulation of oncogenic pathways (13Nagy Z. Tora L.

Although our observation underscores the significance of CRL4Cdt2 in the regulation of Gcn5-mediated oncogenic pathways, we could not rule out the possibility that other targets of CRL4Cdt2 may play an important role in CRL4Cdt2-mediated tumorigenesis. Gcn5 has been exploited as a new target for cancer therapy largely because of its role in the regulation of oncogenic pathways and histone acetylation (16Dekker F.J. Haisma H.J. Drug Discov. Today. 2009; 14: 942-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 17Rekowski M.W. Giannis A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1799: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The current approach is to identify compounds that inhibit Gcn5 histone acetyltransferase activity. Our study identified a novel pathway governing Gcn5 protein stability. Thus, targeting the And-1-CRL4Cdt2 link may be an alternative approach to alter histone acetylation by manipulating Gcn5 protein stability for cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2067838033,"Protein phosphatase magnesium-dependent 1A (PPM1A), a protein serine/threonine phosphatase, controls several signal pathways through cleavage of phosphate from its substrates. However, the in vivo function of Ppm1a in mammals remains unknown. Here we reported that mice lacking Ppm1a developed normally but were impaired in re-epithelialization process during cutaneous wound healing. Specifically, complete or keratinocyte-specific deletion of Ppm1a led to delayed re-epithelialization with reduced keratinocyte migration upon wounding. We showed that this effect was the result of an increase in Smad2/3 phosphorylation in keratinocytes. Keratinocyte-specific Smad2 deficient mice displayed accelerated re-epithelialization with enhanced keratinocyte migration. Importantly, Smad2 and Ppm1a double mutant mice also exhibited accelerated re-epithelialization, demonstrating that the effect of Ppm1a on promoting re-epithelialization is mediated by Smad2 signaling. Furthermore, the decreased expression of specific integrins and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may contribute to the retarded re-epithelialization in Ppm1a mutant mice. These data indicate that Ppm1a, through suppressing Smad2 signaling, plays a critical role in re-epithelialization during wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2012610271,"Streptococcus agalactiae, also referred to as Group B Streptococcus (GBS), is one of the most common causes of life-threatening bacterial infections in infants. In recent years cell surface pili have been identified in several Gram-positive bacteria, including GBS, as important virulence factors and promising vaccine candidates. In GBS, three structurally distinct types of pili have been discovered (pilus 1, 2a and 2b), whose structural subunits are assembled in high-molecular weight polymers by specific class C sortases. In addition, the highly conserved housekeeping sortase A (SrtA), whose main role is to link surface proteins to bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan by a transpeptidation reaction, is also involved in pili cell wall anchoring in many bacteria. Through in vivo mutagenesis, we demonstrate that the LPXTG sorting signal of the minor ancillary protein (AP2) is essential for pilus 2a anchoring. We successfully produced a highly purified recombinant SrtA (SrtAΔN40) able to specifically hydrolyze the sorting signal of pilus 2a minor ancillary protein (AP2-2a) and catalyze in vitro the transpeptidation reaction between peptidoglycan analogues and the LPXTG motif, using both synthetic fluorescent peptides and recombinant proteins. By contrast, SrtAΔN40 does not catalyze the transpeptidation reaction with substrate-peptides mimicking sorting signals of the other pilus 2a subunits (the backbone protein and the major ancillary protein). Thus, our results add further insight into the proposed model of GBS pilus 2a assembly, in which SrtA is required for pili cell wall covalent attachment, acting exclusively on the minor accessory pilin, representing the terminal subunit located at the base of the pilus."

It is inhibited by malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate of fatty acid synthesis, and it responds to OMM curvature and lipid characteristics, which reflect long term nutrient/hormone availability. Here, we show that the N-terminal regulatory domain (N) of CPT1A can adopt two complex amphiphilic structural states, termed Nα and Nβ, that interchange in a switch-like manner in response to offered binding surface curvature. Structure-based site-directed mutageneses of native CPT1A suggest Nα to be inhibitory and Nβ to be noninhibitory, with the relative Nα/Nβ ratio setting the prevalent malonyl-CoA sensitivity of the enzyme. Based on the amphiphilic nature of N and molecular modeling, we propose malonyl-CoA sensitivity to be coupled to the properties of the OMM by Nα-OMM associations that alter the Nα/Nβ ratio.

Clinical history, ventilation parameters, Murray's lung injury severity score (Murray's LISS) and interleukins in BALF were gathered. In addition, samples of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were analyzed by means of hydrophobic chromatography and MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis for each clinical and cytokine parameter revealed interleukin-6>interleukin-8>diabetes mellitus>Murray's LISS as the best outcome predictors. Outcome predicted on the basis of BALF levels of interleukin-6 resulted in 79.4% accuracy, 82.7% sensitivity and 76.1% specificity (area under the ROC curve, AUC, 0.853). Both clinical parameters and cytokines as well as peptide patterns determined by MALDI-ToF MS were analyzed by classification and regression tree (CART) analysis and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. CART analysis including Murray's LISS, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in combination was correct in 78.0%. MALDI-ToF MS of BALF peptides did not reveal a single identifiable biomarker for ARDS. However, classification of patients was successfully achieved based on the entire peptide pattern analyzed using SVM. This method resulted in 90% accuracy, 93.3% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity following a 10-fold cross validation (AUC = 0.953). Subsequent validation of the optimized SVM algorithm with a test group of patients with unknown prognosis yielded 87.5% accuracy, 83.3% sensitivity and 90.0% specificity.MALDI-ToF MS peptide patterns of BALF, evaluated by appropriate mathematical methods can be of value in predicting outcome in pneumonia induced ALI/ARDS."

Several studies since the 1990s suggest that at 3–4 weeks serum penicillin G levels are less than adequate (below MIC90 of 0.016 µg/ml). We studied these levels for 4 weeks after the recommended dose of BPG in military recruits, for whom it is used as prophylaxis against GAS. The 329 subjects (mean age 20 years) each received 1.2 million units BPG IM and gave sera 1 day post injection and twice more at staggered time points over 4 weeks. Serum penicillin G levels were measured by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectometry. The half-life of serum penicillin G was 4.1 days. By day 11, mean levels were <0.02 µg/ml, and by day 15<0.01 µg/ml. Levels in more than 50% of the subjects were below 0.02 µg/ml on day 9, and <.01 µg/ml on day 16. There was no demonstrable effect of subject body-surface area nor of the four different lots of BPG used. These data indicate that in healthy young adults serum penicillin G levels become less than protective <2½ weeks after injection of 1.2 million units of BPG. The findings require serious consideration in future medical and public health recommendations for treatment and prophylaxis of GAS upper respiratory tract infections."
https://openalex.org/W2067534797,"Previous reports by us and others demonstrated that G protein-coupled receptors interact functionally with Rab GTPases. Here, we show that the β(2)-adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR) interacts with the Rab geranylgeranyltransferase α-subunit (RGGTA). Confocal microscopy showed that β(2)AR co-localizes with RGGTA in intracellular compartments and at the plasma membrane. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that RGGTA binds to the L(339)L(340) motif in the β(2)AR C terminus known to be involved in the transport of the receptor from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface. Modulation of the cellular levels of RGGTA protein by overexpression or siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous protein demonstrated that RGGTA has a positive role in the maturation and anterograde trafficking of the β(2)AR, which requires the interaction of RGGTA with the β(2)AR L(339)L(340) motif. Furthermore, the β(2)AR modulates the geranylgeranylation of Rab6a, Rab8a, and Rab11a, but not of other Rab proteins tested in this study. Regulation of Rab geranylgeranylation by the β(2)AR was dependent on the RGGTA-interacting L(339)L(340) motif. Interestingly, a RGGTA-Y107F mutant was unable to regulate Rab geranylgeranylation but still promoted β(2)AR maturation, suggesting that RGGTA may have functions independent of Rab geranylgeranylation. We demonstrate for the first time an interaction between a transmembrane receptor and RGGTA which regulates the maturation and anterograde transport of the receptor, as well as geranylgeranylation of Rab GTPases."

Recently, calcium-regulated heat-stable protein 1 (CARHSP1) was identified as a biomarker for diabetic complications. In this study, we investigated the role of CARHSP1 in hepatic gluconeogenesis. We assessed the regulation of hepatic CARHSP1 expression under conditions of fasting and refeeding. Adenovirus-mediated CARHSP1 overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments were performed to characterize the role of CARHSP1 in the regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression. Here, we document for the first time that CARHSP1 is regulated by nutrient status in the liver and functions at the transcriptional level to negatively regulate gluconeogenic genes, including the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pc) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PEPCK1).

Adenovirus infections were performed by tail vein injection of 2 × 109 adenoviral particles per mouse. Blood glucose was measured by tail bleeds using an Ascencia Elite (Bayer) meter. Wild-type and db/db mice were fasted for 18 h. At time 0, blood glucose was measured, and immediately thereafter, 2 g pyruvate (dissolved in PBS)/kg body weight were injected intraperitoneally. Blood glucose was measured at indicated time points. Mice were fed a standard diet (22.5% protein, 11.8% fat, and 52% carbohydrate by mass) and sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation 4–5 days after adenovirus injection. All animal work was performed in accordance with the University of Michigan Animal Care and Use Committee. Reagents were from the following sources. Forskolin, dexamethasone, insulin, GW6471, and an antibody against FLAG were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies against CARHSP1, PPARα, β-actin, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α), GFP, HNF4α, and GAPDH were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibodies against Myc-tag and phospho-Ser/Thr were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. and Spring Bioscience, respectively. Primary mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 cell lines were grown in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and 50 mg/ml of a Pen/Strep mix in a 37 °C/5% CO2 humidified incubator. Desired DNA fragments encoding different lengths of the G6Pc promoter region were PCR-amplified from human genomic DNA and inserted into the pGL4.11 luciferase reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The inserts were positioned between KpnI and XhoI sites relative to the luciferase coding sequence. Proper insertion was verified by direct DNA sequencing. To construct a pGL4–159-Luc vector containing a mutation in the PPAR-responsive element (pGL4–159mut-Luc), site-directed mutagenesis of the pGL4–159-Luc vector was carried out using PCR methods according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Agilent Technologies). The synthetic oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were 5′-CAAACGTGGTTTTTGGTTCCAACGAGCAGGGCTGGGTTGACCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGTCAACCCAGCCCTGCTCGTTGGAACCAAAACCACGTTTG-3′ (antisense). The coding region sequences corresponding to human CARHSP1-GFP and FLAG-PPARα (full-length and different-length fragments), as well as human HFN4α, were amplified from human cDNA by high-fidelity pfu polymerase (Agilent Technologies). PCR products were sequenced and cloned into pcDNA3.1. HepG2 cells were seeded 24 h before transfection at 50–60% confluence and then cotransfected with plasmids with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Luciferase activity was detected with a luciferase substrate kit (Promega). Primary mouse hepatocytes were reverse-transfected with siRNA-CARHSP1 (s78866, Ambion, Inc.) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Regarding adenovirus infection, hepatocytes were infected with adenoviruses in 10% FBS DMEM for 4 h and then changed to fresh 10% FBS DMEM. To generate adenoviral vectors for overexpressing CARHSP1 or PPARα, the coding region sequences corresponding to human CARHSP1 and PPARα were amplified from human cDNA by high-fidelity pfu polymerase (Agilent Technologies). PCR products were sequenced and cloned into AdTrack-CMV from Agilent Technologies. Next, the gene coding sequences were cloned from Ad-track to the Ad-Easy vector by homologous recombination in Escherichia coli. To package the adenoviruses, adenoviral vectors were linearized with the restriction enzyme, PacI, and transfected into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. After propagation, the recombinant adenoviruses were purified by CsCl2 density gradient ultracentrifugation. Adenovirus genomic DNA was purified with the NucleoSpin virus kit (Macherey Nagel), and adenovirus titration was performed using the Adeno-Xtm quantitative PCR titration kit (Clontech). HepG2 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 0.1% Triton-X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were collected for an immunoprecipitation (IP) assay. Cellular extracts were precleared with protein G plus agarose for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with an anti-CARHSP1 or anti-PPARα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody overnight at 4 °C. Normal IgG was used for a negative control. The immunocomplexes were pulled down by incubation with protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C and washed four times with wash buffer (20 mm, 0.2 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol). The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-PPARα or -CARHSP1 antibody. Total RNA from liver samples of individual animals was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA from cells in culture was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA with SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and oligo-dT20 primers (Invitrogen). The abundance of transcripts was assessed by a real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad) using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The relative quantification for each gene of interest was normalized against the internal control, 18S. The primer sequences are shown in supplemental Table 1. Primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated from 8- to 10-week-old mice as described previously (13Xu J. Xiao G. Trujillo C. Chang V. Blanco L. Joseph S.B. Bassilian S. Saad M.F. Tontonoz P. Lee W.N.

A syringe pump was set up with attached silastic tubing and then inserted into the portal vein. The liver was perfused with liver perfusion medium and liver digestion medium (Invitrogen). Hepatocytes were isolated by shaking the liver in Leibovitz L-15 medium (Invitrogen) on ice. Hepatocytes were washed twice and separated from other types of cells with Percoll (Sigma). Hepatocytes were seeded on rat tail type I collagen-coated plates or dishes (BD Biosciences) in Williams' E medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS for 4 h, followed by a change to fresh 10% FBS DMEM. All mammalian cell extracts were prepared with lysis buffer (Thermo Scientific) that included the following: 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 30 mm 4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm benzamidine, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared with NE-PER® nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Thermo Scientific). Protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE using 12% gels and electroblotted onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS Tween 20 containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk powder, washed twice, and incubated overnight with primary antibodies diluted 1:200–1000 in 5% nonfat milk solution. After further washing, membranes were incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit or mouse IRDye-conjugated IgG (Li-Cor Odyssey) secondary antibody diluted 1:5000 for 1 h. Blots were scanned, and the image was displayed in grayscale. The intensity of the protein bands was quantified using an image processing program (Li-Cor Odyssey). Mouse primary hepatocytes were infected with adenoviruses (50 m.o.i./each adenovirus) for 24 h in 10% FBS DMEM, and then maintained in 0.2% FBS DMEM for another 24 h. Next, media were replaced with Krebs-Ringer buffer (115 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4)) plus 10 mm lactate and 1 mm pyruvate. Eight hours later, the glucose released in the media was measured using a QuantiChromtm glucose assay kit (Bioassay Systems, CA). ChIP assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications using the EZ ChIP kit (Millipore). In brief, liver tissue or hepatocytes were treated for 15 min with 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for cross-linking, and these reactions were terminated by the addition of glycine at a final concentration of 125 mm. Liver tissue or cells were lysed and chromatin extracts were sonicated for obtaining DNA fragments between 500–1000 bp. The sonicated chromatin was first precleared for 1 h with protein G-agarose. After centrifugation, supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg anti-PPARα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or normal rabbit IgG. The immunoprecipitated DNA-protein complex was incubated with protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the complex was washed in low-salt buffer, high-salt buffer, LiCl buffer, and Tris-EDTA buffer. The protein-chromatin cross-linking in the immunoprecipitated complex was reversed at 65 °C overnight. Proteins were eliminated using Proteinase K for 30 min at 45 °C. DNA was purified and used as a template for real-time PCR. The PCR primers used for the analysis of G6Pc and PEPCK1 promoters are listed in supplemental Table 1. PCR amplification products were confirmed on ethidium bromide-stained 2% agarose gels. Statistical comparisons and analyses between two groups were performed by two-tailed unpaired Student's t test, and among three groups or more they were performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by a Newman-Keuls test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. To determine whether CARHSP1 is a potential regulator of metabolism, we first detected its expression in the liver. CARHSP1 protein levels were significantly reduced after mice were fasted for 24 h. Furthermore, CARHSP1 protein expression was increased after mice were refed for 1 h and returned to base line after 6 h of refeeding (Fig. 1, A and B), although CARHSP1 mRNA expression levels remained low (C). To mimic fasting signals in vivo, primary mouse hepatocytes were isolated and incubated in vitro with forskolin (FSK) and dexamethasone (DEX) (14Rodgers J.T. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Puigserver P. Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 23-34Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in a low-nutrient status (0.2% FBS medium) for 16 h. CARHSP1 protein levels were significantly reduced in these altered culture conditions (Fig. 1D). CARHSP1 mRNA expression was down-regulated, whereas G6Pc and PEPCK1 (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, soluble) mRNA levels were up-regulated by stimulation with forskolin and dexamethasone (Fig. 1E). G6Pc and PEPCK1 are regulated at the transcriptional level by a variety of hormonal and nutrient signals including insulin, glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, and cyclic AMP (15Hall R.K. Granner D.K. J. Basic Clin. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 10: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16Hanson R.W. Reshef L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that fasting conditions contribute to the changes of CARHSP1 expression in the liver. Insulin signaling is activated during refeeding. We found that insulin increases CARHSP1 expression but decreases G6Pc expression in primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 2, A–C). Insulin treatment also induced CARHSP1 phosphorylation, whereas wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, blocked phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Regarding the subcellular protein location of CARHSP1, we demonstrated that CARHSP1 is located in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of hepatocytes (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, we found that insulin induced CARHSP1 nuclear translocation in hepatocytes (Fig. 2F). All in all, our data suggest that regulation of CARHSP1 expression and subcellular localization occur during fasting and refeeding conditions.FIGURE 2Subcellular distribution of CARHSP1 in hepatocytes. A, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with insulin (50 nm) in 2% FBS DMEM and the expression levels of CARHSP1 (A) and of G6Pc (B) were determined by real-time PCR at different time points. C, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with insulin at different dosages for 24 h, and the expression of CARHSP1was determined by real-time PCR. D, HepG2 cells were incubated with insulin (50 nm) for the indicated times. Cells treated with insulin for 30 min were pretreated with wortmannin (200 nm). Cell extracts were subjected to coimmunoprecipitation with an antibody against CARHSP1 and then immunoblotting with an antibody against phosphorylated Ser/Thr (pan). E, cytoplasmic and nuclear aliquots (20 μg loaded protein) were purified from HepG2 cells and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. F, primary mouse hepatocytes were treated with insulin (50 nm) for different times. Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein were extracted and subjected to immunoblotting analysis. Nuclear CARHSP1 is quantitatively analyzed and normalized against Lamin A/C.

The expression of Ad-CARHSP1 in the liver was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, CARHSP1 gain of function in the liver significantly inhibited gluconeogenic gene expression at 4 days after adenovirus tail vein injection (Fig. 3B). Moreover, in cultured primary mouse hepatocytes, CARHSP1 dramatically inhibited G6Pc and PEPCK1 expression both in low serum (0.2% serum) and upon further induction in the presence of forskolin (10 μm) and dexamethasone (1 μm) (Fig. 3C). A similar result was observed in the CARHSP1-overexpressing HepG2 human hepatocyte cell line (Fig. 3D). CARHSP1 also decreased the protein expression of G6Pc and PEPCK1 in primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 3E). Functionally, CARHSP1 overexpression potently inhibited glucose output from primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 3F). Hepatic glucose output generally reflects the total flux resulting from gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways (17Vega R.B. Huss J.M. Kelly D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1868-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). Overall, our data suggest that CARHSP1 inhibits glucose output at least partly through modulation of gluconeogenesis. To determine whether CARHSP1 functions in a physiological context, we investigated the effect of endogenous CARHSP1 on the expression of gluconeogenic genes. Using siRNA against CARHSP1, the expression of CARHSP1 was efficiently knocked down in hepatocytes at both the protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 4, A and B). Consistent with our observation that CARHSP1 gain of function in hepatocytes resulted in marked down-regulation of gluconeogenic genes, CARHSP1 loss of function, conversely, increased the expression of G6Pc and PEPCK1 (Fig. 4, C and D) both in basal and forskolin+DEX-stimulated conditions. This indicates that loss of CARHSP1 is probably releasing basal inhibition of these genes. CARHSP1 knockdown also significantly increases glucose output from primary mouse hepatocytes (Fig. 4E). Thus, CARHSP1 is required to maintain steady basal levels of expression and ensure homeostatic regulation of gluconeogenic genes. Previous studies identified that PPARα could regulate gluconeogenic genes in both wild-type (18Im S.S. Kim M.Y. Kwon S.K. Kim T.H. Bae J.S. Kim H. Kim K.S. Oh G.T. Ahn Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 1157-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and DEX-treated LDL receptor (LDL-R) null mice (19Bernal-Mizrachi C. Weng S. Feng C. Finck B.N. Knutsen R.H. Leone T.C. Coleman T. Mecham R.P. Kelly D.P. Semenkovich C.F. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 1069-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). We found that CARHSP1 inhibits PPARα-induced expression of G6Pc and PEPCK1 by as much as 80% in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5A) and potently inhibits PPARα-induced glucose output in primary hepatocytes (B). Therefore, our data suggest that there is an inhibitory epistatic effect of CARHSP1 on PPARα activity in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis. Next, we sought to investigate the mechanisms linking CARHSP1 and PPARα in hepatic gluconeogenesis. CARHSP1 could impair PPARα activity in different ways (i.e. affecting protein levels, subcellular protein localization, or DNA binding). However, we found that CARHSP1 did not alter PPARα protein expression in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5C). As determined by a coimmunoprecipitation assay, endogenous CARHSP1 physically interacts with PPARα in vivo (Fig. 5D) and in vitro (E). To determine the respective binding domains of both CARHSP1 and PPARα, we generated CARHSP1 fragment-GFP fusion proteins and FLAG-PPARα fragments to perform immunoprecipitation assays. We found the 1–60-amino acid (aa) sequence of CARHSP1 binds to PPARα (Fig. 6A), whereas the 167–244-aa sequence of PPARα binds to CARHSP1, respectively (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, the PPARα agonist WY-14643 can induce the dissociation of CARHSP1 from PPARα (Fig. 6C). To determine whether CARHSP1 competes with coactivators of PPARα, we performed coimmunoprecipitation and ChIP assays. PGC-1α is a well known PPARα coactivator that plays a critical role in gluconeogenesis. We demonstrated that CARHSP1 reduced the binding of PGC-1α to PPARα in hepatocytes (Fig. 6D). Moreover, CARHSP1 could suppress the binding of PGC-1α to the G6Pc promoter, where there exists a PPRE site for PPARα binding (Fig. 6E). To further establish whether CARHSP1 regulates gluconeogenic gene expression at the transcriptional level, we constructed pGL4 vectors with inserted DNA fragments in varying lengths encoding the G6Pc promoter. Overexpression of PPARα resulted in increased activation of the G6Pc promoter (-1035/+80, −520/+80, and −159/+80) in HepG2 cells, which can be readily inhibited by CARHSP1 (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, it should be noted that CARHSP1 can inhibit G6Pc promoter activity in the absence of overexpressed PPARα, consistent with its ability to regulate basal levels of G6Pc in these cells, as described above (Fig. 3). However, PPARα cannot activate the −52/+80 fragment of the G6Pc promoter, which implies that a functional binding site may exist between −159 bp and −52 bp in the G6Pc promoter. Analysis of transcriptional binding sites with Genomatix software showed that highly conserved PPAR-response elements (PPREs) exist in both human and mouse G6Pc promoters. The putative PPRE (-75/-63) was mutated to determine whether this PPRE is a functional PPARα binding element. The G6Pc-PPREmut promoter could not be activated by PPARα. Furthermore, CARHSP1 had no inhibitory effect on the activity of the mutated promoter (Fig. 7B), suggesting CARHSP1-mediated down-regulation of the G6Pc gene via PPARα. Next, CHIP assays were performed to further determine the effect of CARHSP1 on PPARα binding to the promoter regions of gluconeogenic genes. Consistent with the data shown above, we demonstrate that PPARα can directly bind to the putative PPRE (-75/-63 bp) in the G6Pc promoter and that CARHSP1 potently inhibits the binding of PPARα to this PPRE in human hepatocytes infected with Ad-CARHSP1 (Fig. 7C). Similar results were observed regarding CARHSP1 inhibition of PPARα binding to the PPRE (-387/-399) existing in the human PEPCK1 promoter in HepG2 cells (Fig. 7C). Our data also demonstrate that CARHSP1 has a potent inhibitory effect on the binding of PPARα to G6Pc and PEPCK1 promoters in the mouse liver 4 days after delivering Ad-CARHSP1 by the tail vein (Fig. 7D). Thus, our data identified that CARHSP1 inhibits G6Pc and PEPCK1 expression at the transcriptional level through inhibition of PPARα activity. To determine the repressive domain of CARHSP1, we generated different lengths of the CARHSP1 coding region. The N-terminal 31–65-amino acid sequence of CARHSP1 is necessary for CARHSP1 to fulfill its inhibitory effect on PPARα-induced activation of G6Pc promoter (Fig. 7, E and F). Next, we determined whether CARHSP1 interacts with other nuclear transcriptional factors. HNF4α is a well demonstrated transcriptional factor in regulating gluconeogenesis. However, we did not observe an interaction between CARHSP1 and HNF4α (Fig. 8A), and CARHSP1 did not significantly inhibit HNF4α-induced expression of G6Pc and PEPCK1 (B). To determine whether PPARα is an essential mediator of CARHSP1-induced inhibition of gluconeogenesis, we pharmacologically inactivated PPARα through administration of the PPARα antagonist GW6471, which induces a PPARα conformational change followed by the recruitment of corepressors (20Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M. Plunket K.D. Nolte R.T. Parks D.J. Moore J.T. Kliewer S.A. Willson T.M. Stimmel J.B. Nature. 2002; 415: 813-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Interestingly, after GW6471 treatment (20 μm), G6Pc and PEPCK1 expression levels did not change when HepG2 cells were treated with Ad-CARHSP1, which indicated that the regulation of gluconeogenic genes by CARHSP1 was blocked dramatically when PPARα was antagonized (Fig. 8, C and D). We further examined the necessary role of PPARα in mediating the effect of CARHSP1 on gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes isolated from PPARα knockout mice. Consistent with what we observed in pharmacologically PPARα-inactivated hepatocytes, we demonstrated that CARHSP1 also lost its inhibitory effect on G6Pc and PEPCK1 expression in PPARα knockout hepatocytes (Fig. 8, E and F). These data support our hypothesis that CARHSP1, by inhibiting PPARα activity, is a negative regulator of hepatic gluconeogenic genes. Because CARHSP1 overexpression results in down-regulation of gluconeogenic genes, we sought to test the hypothesis that increases in CARHSP1 will suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis in vivo. As shown in Fig. 9A, overexpression of CARHSP1 reduced fasting blood glucose levels in C57BL/6J mice. More interestingly, the pyruvate sodium tolerance tests performed in our study demonstrate that changes in blood glucose levels were significantly reduced in CARHSP1-treated a"
https://openalex.org/W1981728570,"Cys-loop receptors are pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) that bind neurotransmitters to open an intrinsic transmembrane ion channel pore. The recent crystal structure of a prokaryotic pLGIC from the cyanobacterium Gloeobacter violaceus (GLIC) revealed that it naturally lacks an N-terminal extracellular α helix and an intracellular domain that are typical of eukaryotic pLGICs. GLIC does not respond to neurotransmitters acting at eukaryotic pLGICs but is activated by protons. To determine whether the structural differences account for functional differences, we used a eukaryotic chimeric acetylcholine-glutamate pLGIC that was modified to carry deletions corresponding to the sequences missing in the prokaryotic homolog GLIC. Deletions made in the N-terminal extracellular α helix did not prevent the expression of receptor subunits and the appearance of receptor assemblies on the cell surface but abolished the capability of the receptor to bind α-bungarotoxin (a competitive antagonist) and to respond to the neurotransmitter. Other truncated chimeric receptors that lacked the intracellular domain did bind ligands; displayed robust acetylcholine-elicited responses; and shared with the full-length chimeric receptor similar anionic selectivity, effective open pore diameter, and unitary conductance. We suggest that the integrity of the N-terminal α helix is crucial for ligand accommodation because it stabilizes the intersubunit interfaces adjacent to the neurotransmitter-binding pocket(s). We also conclude that the intracellular domain of the chimeric acetylcholine-glutamate receptor does not modulate the ion channel conductance and is not involved in positioning of the pore-lining helices in the conformation necessary for coordinating a Cl- ion within the intracellular vestibule of the ion channel pore."
https://openalex.org/W2091414864,"Saposin-like proteins (SAPLIPs) from soil-transmitted helminths play pivotal roles in host-pathogen interactions and have a high potential as targets for vaccination against parasitic diseases. We have identified two non-orthologous SAPLIPs from human and dog hookworm, Na-SLP-1 and Ac-SLP-1, and solved their three-dimensional crystal structures. Both proteins share the property of membrane binding as monitored by liposome co-pelleting assays and monolayer adsorption. Neither SAPLIP displayed any significant haemolytic or bactericidal activity. Based on the structural information, as well as the results from monolayer adsorption, we propose models of membrane interactions for both SAPLIPs. Initial membrane contact of the monomeric Na-SLP-1 is most likely by electrostatic interactions between the membrane surface and a prominent basic surface patch. In case of the dimeric Ac-SLP-1, membrane interactions are most likely initiated by a unique tryptophan residue that has previously been implicated in membrane interactions in other SAPLIPs."

https://openalex.org/W2004864881,"(S(C5'), R(P)) α,β-D- Constrained Nucleic Acids (CNA) are dinucleotide building blocks that can feature either B-type torsional angle values or non-canonical values, depending on their 5'C and P absolute stereochemistry. These CNA are modified neither on the nucleobase nor on the sugar structure and therefore represent a new class of nucleotide with specific chemical and structural characteristics. They promote marked bending in a single stranded DNA so as to preorganize it into a loop-like structure, and they have been shown to induce rigidity within oligonucleotides. Following their synthesis, studies performed on CNA have only focused on the constraints that this family of nucleotides introduced into DNA. On the assumption that bending in a DNA template may produce a terminator structure, we investigated whether CNA could be used as a new strong terminator of polymerization in PCR. We therefore assessed the efficiency of CNA as a terminator in PCR, using triethylene glycol phosphate units as a control. Analyses were performed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and several PCR products were further analysed by sequencing. The results showed that the incorporation of only one CNA was always skipped by the polymerases tested. On the other hand, two CNA units always stopped proofreading polymerases, such as Pfu DNA polymerase, as expected for a strong replication terminator. Non-proofreading enzymes, e.g. Taq DNA polymerase, did not recognize this modification as a strong terminator although it was predominantly stopped by this structure. In conclusion, this first functional use of CNA units shows that these modified nucleotides can be used as novel polymerization terminators of proofreading polymerases. Furthermore, our results lead us to propose that CNA and their derivatives could be useful tools for investigating the behaviour of different classes of polymerases."
