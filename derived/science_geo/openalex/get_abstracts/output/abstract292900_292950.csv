https://openalex.org/W2025020270,Microcolonial structures have been harvested from desert rock samples for cultivation and ultrastructural examination. The results indicate that these microcolonial structures are fungi previously unrecognized as inhabitants of desert rocks.
https://openalex.org/W2056416699,"Facultative control of the sex ratio has been reported in the wasp Nasonia vitripennis. In a newly wild-eaught strain, females produced few or no male offspring and did not show the usual alterations of sex ratio in response to external conditions. The aberrant trait is inherited through females."

The average pseudo-first-order rate constant for removal was 0.18 per hour, with a range of 0.14 to 0.24 per hour under daylight conditions for four study days. The removal process is dominated by chemical conversion to nitric acid and organic nitrates. The removal rate suggests an atmospheric lifetime for nitrogen oxides of about 5 to 6 hours in urban air."
https://openalex.org/W2016670769,"A brilliant new comet (1979 XI: Howard-Koomen-Michels) was discovered in data from the Naval Research Laboratory's orbiting SOLWIND coronagraph. An extensive sequence of pictures, telemetered from the P78-1 satellite, shows the coma, accompanied by a bright and well-developed tail, passing through the coronagraph's field of view at afew million kilometers from the sun. Preliminary orbital calculations based on the observed motion of the comet's head and morphology of the tail indicate that this previously unreported object is a sungrazing comet and may be one of the group of Kreutz sungrazers. It appears from the data that the perihelion distance was less than 1 solar radius, so that the cometary nucleus encountered dense regions of the sun's atmosphere, was completely vaporized, and did not reappear after the time of closest approach to the sun. After this time, however, cometary debris, scattered into the ambient solar wind, caused a brightening of the corona over one solar hemisphere and to heliocentric distances of 5 to 10 solar radii."
https://openalex.org/W1998651052,Image-intensified photographs of delayed light emission (DLE) from soybean leaves exposed to sulfur dioxide showed evidence of the stress that developed during the exposure period. A comparison of DLE images taken during the fumigation with a conventional photograph taken 5 days later showed a clear correspondence between leaf areas that had the most diminished DLE intensity and those that showed the greatest visible injury. These results suggest that DLE imagery will be a useful tool in the investigation of the spatial distribution and temporal development of plant stress.
https://openalex.org/W2008343138,"Delta (0.5 to 3 hertz) waves are the electroencephalographic hallmark of human sleep. We measured their rate of production during and following an extended night of sleep. On the extended night, we confirmed previous observations of a linear decline in delta wave production across the first four periods of non-rapid-eye-movement (non-REM) sleep. An asymptote was reached in the fifth non-REM period, perhaps signifying that sleep processes reached completion. On the day after the extended night, subjects were allowed to remain awake 3.6 hours less than normal. During the next sleep session, amplitude and number of delta waves in non-REM periods 1 and 3 were significantly reduced. These findings illustrate the value of computer analysis of electroencephalographic waveforms in sleep. Systematic measurement of the amount and distribution of these waveforms as a function of preceding waking duration should provide clues to the kinetics of the metabolic processes underlying sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2087361670,"Red tide-forming dinoflagellates maximize cell numbers during periods of low light intensities in two ways. For short-term exposures to suboptimal light intensities such as might occur during recirculation in frontal convergences, cell division rates can be maintained at the expense of stored carbon for up to two generation times. During longer periods, corresponding to subsurface transport below a pycnocline, cell division rates eventually decrease as a portion of the fixed carbon is diverted to replenishing stored carbon. As a result, maximum rates of cell division can be resumed rapidly upon advection into surface waters where light intensities are optimal for growth."
