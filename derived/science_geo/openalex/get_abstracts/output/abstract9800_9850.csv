https://openalex.org/W2005951087,"Erythrocyte ghosts containing a known number of molecules of purified fragment A of diphtheria toxin with a constant amount of FITC-BSA as a fluorescence marker were prepared by dialyzing a mixture of erythrocytes and these substances against hypotonic solution. These substances were then introduced into diphtheria toxin-resistant mouse L cells by virus-mediated cell fusion of the cells with the ghosts, and mononuclear recipients that has fused with only one erythrocyte ghost were separated in a flourescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) on the basis of their cell size and fluorescence intensity. After separation, the viability of cells containing known numbers of fragment A was examined by measuring colony-forming ability. The results demonstrated that a single molecule of fragment A was sufficient to kill a cell. This fact was confirmed by introduction into cells of fragment A from an immunologically related mutant toxin, CRM 176 (fragment A176); this has a completely functional fragment B region, but in cell extracts, the enzymic activity of its fragment A is about 10 fold less than that of wild toxin. The cytotoxicity of CRM 176 is about two hundredths of that of the wild-type (Uchida, Pappenheimer and Greany, 1973). As expected, about 100-200 fold excess of fragment A-176 was needed to kill the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068609723,"Total human DNA was cleaved with a variety of restriction enzymes, and the fragments were fractionated by gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filter strips. The restricted DNA was then hybridized to nick-translated radioactive recombinant plasmid DNA containing sequences derived from human β-globin messenger RNA. Under suitable conditions, this probe hybridizes with both the β- and δ-globin genes. Using this probe, a restriction map of the human β- and δ-globin genes and the surrounding genomic DNA regions has been constructed. The β-globin gene contains a nonglobin DNA insert approximately 800–1000 base pairs in length, present within the sequence coding for amino acids 101–120 of the 146 amino acid long globin polypeptide. A similar sequence may be present within the same sequence of the δ-globin gene. The distance between the β- and δ-globin genes is approximately 7000 nucleotide pairs, and the δ-globin gene is to the 5′ side of the β-globin gene, as predicted by genetic evidence. Both genes are transcribed from the same DNA strand. The structure of the Hb Lepore gene is shown to be a fused δ- and β-globin gene, and to be completely consistent with the derived map of normal β- and δ-globin genes. [Restriction enzyme nomenclature follows that of Smith and Nathans, 1973 Smith H.O. Nathans D. A suggested nomenclature for bacterial host modification and restriction systems and their enzymes. J.

A genomic DNA restriction fragment containing part or all of one globin gene will be designated by that globin chain-for instance, the Pst I fragment containing the β-globin gene sequence will be designated Pst 1 β. A similar convention will be used for double digests. Throughout this paper, when reference is made to the 5′ or 3′ side or fragment of a gene, this refers to the 5′ or 3′ side of the mRNA coded by that sequence. Thus the 5′ side (N terminal) of the β-globin gene is the sequence to the 5′ side of the anti-sense strand.]"
https://openalex.org/W1553874478,"An unadecapeptide, obtained by papain digestion of denatured human alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha-1-PI), has been isolated and sequenced. The structure of this fragment overlaps with the NH2-terminal sequence of modified inhibitor (alpha-1-PI) prepared from dissociated complexes of alpha-1-PI with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase. Furthermore, structural homology with the reactive centers of proteinase inhibitors from other sources is readily detectable. Methionine has been found to occupy the apparent P1 position in alpha-1-PI and the potential inactivation of the inhibitor by oxidation of this critical residue may be important in obtaining a biochemical link with the development of lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W1991348330,"Previously reported studies demonstrated that infused human placental β-glucuronidase is rapidly cleared from rat plasma and localizes predominantly in rat liver. Prior treatment of the enzyme with sodium metaperiodate converted the enzyme to a very slow clearance form. This suggested that the clearance system recognized the carbohydrate structure of the glycoprotein hydrolase. This report defines the glycosyl specificity and the cell type(s) involved in the clearance process. Clearance of infused human β-glucuronidase was blocked by simultaneous infusion of glycoproteins which have mannose or N-acetylglucosamine in their exposed nonreducing position, or by some simple sugars (α-methylmannoside, mannose or L-fucose) which block clearance of these glycoproteins. Two immunohistochemical techniques demonstrated preferential localization of human β-glucuronidase in sinusoidal lining cells (nonparenchymal cells) in rat liver. Human placental β-glucuronidase was also taken up by isolated rat alveolar macrophages by the carbohydrate-mediated glycoprotein uptake system recently demonstrated in these cells. This isolated cell uptake system appears to have the same specificity as the system for plasma clearance of infused human placental β-glucuronidase in the intact rat. The combined data from in vivo clearance studies and from studies of enzyme uptake by isolated rat macrophages suggest that a mannose/N-acetylglucosamine-glycoprotein uptake system is expressed on fixed tissue macrophages in the rat, and that this system mediates plasma clearance of infused human placental β-glucuronidase."
https://openalex.org/W2064878516,"The cell line Rama 25 is derived from a mammary tumor induced in a rat by dimethylbenzanthracene. During rapid proliferation, Rama 25 cells appear as a single undifferentiated epithelial type; at high cell densities, however, small numbers of two other cell types are formed, which respectively resemble secretory and myoepithelial cells of the mammary gland, as judged by light and electron microscopy and immunofluorescent staining for casein (milk proteins). These additional cell types cannot be explained as contaminating cell populations since the cell line has been cloned several times; furthermore, the proportion of either can be increased by dimethylsulphoxide under different conditions. Specific epithelial features are seen by histological and ultrastructural examination of tumors formed by Rama 25 cells in immunodeficient mice. A line of the myoepithelial-like cells, Rama 29, isolated from a Rama 25 culture by cloning, is also described. We propose that the undifferentiated cell type is a form of mammary stem cell which can differentiate in culture."
https://openalex.org/W2124642053,"Saturation analysis over a wide range of [3H]estradiol concentrations (0.05 to 80 IBM) yields data indicative of two distinct types of binding sites in cytosol prepared from uteri of mature or immature rats. Type I sites have a dissociation constant (&) of 0.8 nM and constitute approximately 1.0 pmol of the sites present in an immature rat uterus (wet weight, 35 mg; DNA, 300 pg). The affinity of type II sites for estradiol is considerably lower than type I sites (Kd, 30 IBM); however, the numbers of sites are 4-fold greater than type I. Type I sites represent the classical estrogen receptor which has a sedimentation coefficient of 8 S on low salt sucrose density gradients and will undergo translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In contrast, type II sites do not translocate to the nucleus and [3H]estradiol dissociates from these sites when cytosol is labeled prior to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. However, type II sites are readily measured as a 4 S macromolecule by the hydroxylapatite adsorption assay of postlabeled gradient fractions. This technique permits the measurement of both 8 and 4 S sites under equilibrium conditions and thus avoids underestimates due to dissociation of C3H]estradiol from both sites during the centrifugation period. This postlabeled hydroxylapatite-gradient method should be of value in the accurate determination of the quantities of both 8 and 4 S binding sites in all receptor systems and should be particularly valuable for measuring these sites in biopsy samples of mammary cancer tissue. Type II sites are found predominantly in estrogen-sensitive tissues and only low levels occur in nontarget tissues. Estradiol, estrone, estriol, and diethylstilbestrol compete equally well for binding to type II sites while progesterone and testosterone have no effect on [3H]estradiol binding. These characteristics, plus the presence of these sites in adult tissues, exclude the possibility that they represent a-fetoprotein. The presence of type II sites complicates the accurate measurement and differentiation of type I sites. Valid estimates of binding parameters of both sites can be obtained by saturation analysis over a wide range of [3H]estradiol concentrations and resolution of the two binding components by the methods of Scatchard and Rosenthal (Scatchard, G.

https://openalex.org/W2013946016,"The rabbit alpha-globin DNA insertion in the chimeric plasmid pHb 72 (Liu et al., 1977) has been sequenced by the method of Maxam and Gilbert (1977). This has enabled us to determine the messenger RNA(mRNA) sequence beginning in the 5' untranslated region 9 nucleotides before the initiation codon and extending through the first 361 nucleotides of the translated region. The data reported here overlap and are in complete agreement with sequences determined by Baralle (1977) for the 5' end of the mRNA and by Proudfoot et al. (1977) for the 3' end. Our sequence is also in agreement with the partial complementary RNA (cRNA) sequencing data which we reported previously (Paddock et al., 1977), this work marks the completion of the primary sequence of the rabbit alpha-globin mRNA. These observations reaffirm the high fidelity with which gene copies can be synthesized in vitro, cloned in a bacterial plasmid and maintained in the host. The general features of the mRNA nucleotide sequence are duscussed with particular attention given to the base composition and codon preferences observed and to comparison of this sequence with other completed mRNA gene sequences. A new computer program has been used to search for the most stable base-pairing arrangement of the completed mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1552261626,"The NH2-terminal sequence and carbohydrate attachment site of the 95,000-dalton transmembrane polypeptide (Band 3) from human erythrocyte membranes have been studied. The blocked NH2-terminal sequence is Ac-Met-Glu-Glu; the presence of this sequence in specific fragments of the polypeptide confirms that the end of the polypeptide which is inside the cell is the NH2-terminal. The carbohydrate associated with the Band 3 polypeptide appears to be attached at a single site in the COOH-terminal third of the molecule, to a region with composition Asx1Ser2; this confirms that part of the polypeptide toward the COOH-terminal is outside the cell. The carbohydrate structure appears to be extremely heterogeneous both in size and composition, which probably causes the Band 3 polypeptide to migrate as a diffuse band on dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis."
https://openalex.org/W37050816,"Exposure of insulin-responsive, differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (adipocytes) to 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/ml of insulin for 3 to 48 h resulted in a persistent state of enhanced 2-deoxy-D-glucose and 3-O-methyl-D-glucose uptake. Elevated basal transport activity was retained under conditions where 125I-insulin binding activity remained unchanged and exchangeable insulin was dissociated from cell surface receptors. The appearance of enhanced hexose transport activity was prevented by cycloheximide and could be distinguished from the activation of the glucose transport system observed in these and other cells during glucose deprivation. Rigorously washed adipocytes, exhibiting insulin-induced elevations in basal transport activity, were refractory to further stimulation by insulin during hexose uptake assays. Insulin-unresponsive 3T3-L1 preadipocytes failed to increase hexose uptake activity when treated under conditions that elicited an optimal response in adipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2135533559,"The regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase mul- tienzyme complex was studied in the isolated perfused rat heart. Because 95% of the “CO2 produced as a result of the decarboxylation of [l-‘4C]pyruvate occurs via pyruvate dehydrogenase in the heart, the rate of 14COz production from infused [l-‘4C]pyruvate was utilized as the monitor of the metabolic flux through this enzyme complex. In contrast to results obtained in the perfused liver, infusion of fatty acids of varying chain length into the heart resulted in the inhibition of flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase under all metabolic condi- tions tested. Both acetoacetate and @-hydroxybutyrate infusion caused nearly identical degrees of inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase flux (i.e. 85%). However, acetoacetate and &hydroxybutyrate caused changes in the percentage of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active form from 56 to 43 and 33%. respectively. On the basis of measurements of various nucleotide species in the heart tissue extracts under the different conditions of perfusion, it is suggested that the primary effector of the inhibition/inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase by fatty acids or ketone bodies, or both, was the acetyl- CoA/CoASH ratio. Further, it was shown that the ki- netics of fatty acid-mediated inactivation of pyruvate dehydrogenase are certainly no slower than the overall negative change in the metabolic flux through the en- zyme complex upon initiation of the fatty acid infusion. It is concluded that a combination of measurements of (a) metabolic flux rates, (b) the active/total pyruvate dehydrogenase activities, and (c) the tissue levels of various effector molecules of this regulatory system represents an effective approach to a precise determi- nation of the responses of a very complex regulatory system for this multienzyme complex during physiolog- ically meaningful metabolic state changes in cardiac tissue. Most of our present notions concerning the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase multienzyme complex have been based primarily upon experiments performed using the puri- lied enzyme complex or mitochondrial preparations from var- ious tissues and species. What has emerged from an intense experimental consideration in numerous laboratories is a rather complex system of control based upon two different types of regulatory mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W1534475664,"Human immune interferon, induced in leukocytes by phytohemagglutinin, was prepared in the absence and presence of tunicamycin, an antibiotic which selectively inhibits the glycosylation of newly synthesized glycoproteins. Interferon preparations, produced in the absence of the antibiotic, displayed a considerable chromatographic heterogeneity on: (a) concanavalin A-agarose, (b) phenyl-agarose, (c) Cibacron Blue F3GA-agarose, and (d) polyuridylic acid-agarose. This heterogeneity was completely eliminated when tunicamycin (2 microgram/ml) was present during induction of interferon; all activity was then recovered in the breakthrough fractions from all sorbents. The level of interferon activity in leukocyte culture fluid was not affected by tunicamycin within the range of concentration 0.05 to 2.0 microgram/ml. These data indicate that (a) human immune interferon undergoes glycosylation, and tunicamycin is an effective inhibitor of this process. Thus, it appears that (b) at least some of the carbohydrates of human immune interferon are N-glycosidically linked. Moreover, it seems that (c) glycosylation is not necessary for an interferon molecule to either be secreted by the cell or (d) to express its antiviral function. Such properties of human immune interferon as (e) the apparent hydrophobicity and (f) an affinity for a polyribonucleotide are conferred only when its glycosylation is unimpaired."

Employing brome mosaic virus RNA ending in m7G(5')pppG- as substrate, a simple DEAE-cellulose filter assay measuring the incorporation of methyl groups from S-adenosyl[methyl-3H]methionine to position 2' of the penultimate nucleoside was devised. Starting from disrupted vaccinia virus cores, a 350-fold enzyme purification was achieved by successive chromatography on columns of DEAE-cellulose, CM-Sephadex, and APP-agarose. Analysis of the isolated enzyme by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide discontinuous gel electrophoresis revealed a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 38,000. Similar molecular weights were obtained by sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration of the native methyltransferase. The isoelectric point of the purified enzyme occurs at pH 8.4."
https://openalex.org/W1509176726,"An mRNA(nucleoside-2'-)-methyltransferase purified from vaccinia virus was shown to methylate the penultimate nucleoside of RNA ending in m7G(5')pppN-. By contrast, RNAs ending in pN-, ppN-, or even G(5')pppN- are not methyl acceptors. This specificity indicates that 2'-O-methylation is the final step in the formation of the m7G(5')pppNm- cap structure. Both adenosine and guanosine are methylated, in accordance with the presence of these nucleosides in the penultimate position of vaccinia virus mRNAs. Studies with homopolyribonucleotides containing m7G(5')pppN ends indicated that poly(A) and poly(I) were the best methyl acceptors while significant but much less activity was obtained with poly(G), poly(U), and poly(C). Simple dinucleotides of the type m7G(5')pppN, however, are poor substrates and do not compete with capped RNA. Additional studies indicate that the methyltransferase has a pH optimum of 7.5, does not require divalent cations, is inhibited by S-adenosylhomocysteine, has a Km of 2.0 micrometer for S-adenosylmethionine, a Km of approximately 5 nM for brome mosaic virus RNA, and kinetics consistent with a random bireactant mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1481147497,"Abstract The mechanism of the 1'-4 coupling reaction between isopentenyl pyrophosphate and geranyl pyrophosphate catalyzed by farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase from porcine liver was studied with the allylic substrate analogue 2-fluorogeranyl pyrophosphate. 2-Fluorogeranyl pyrophosphate is an alternate substrate for the enzyme, yielding 6-fluorofarnesyl pyrophosphate upon condensation with isopentenyl pyrophosphate. The Michaelis constant for the fluoroanalogue, Km = 1.1 micron, is similar to that measured for geranyl pyrophosphate, Km = 0.7 micron. However, the rate of condensation with the fluoroanalogue was only 8.4 X 10(-4) that of the normal reaction. A similar rate of depression (4.4 X 10(-3)) was found for solvolysis of geranyl methanesulfonate and the corresponding 2-fluoro derivative, reactions known to proceed via cationic intermediates. In contrast, displacement of chlorine from geranyl chloride and 2-fluorogeranyl chloride by cyanide showed a small (2-fold) rate enhancement for the fluoro compound. Finally, 2-fluorogeranyl pyrophosphate is a competitive inhibitor against geranyl pyrophosphate. These data are interpreted in terms of an ionization-condensation-elimination mechanism for the 1'-4 coupling reaction."

Thus with respect to its testis-determining properties, P or a closely linked gene acts as an autosomal recessive. Polled intersex goats are H-Y+.

https://openalex.org/W1531132104,"When D-glucose was added to a suspension of renal brush border membrane vesicles equilibrated in a Na+-containing medium, there was a rapid transient increase in the fluorescence of the probe, 3,3'-dipropyl thiodicarbocyanine iodide (DiS-C3-(5)). This sugar-induced response was stereospecific for the D isomer, dependent on Na+, inhibited by phlorizin, and blocked by ionophores, valinomycin plus nigericin, which dissipate ionic gradients. The enhancement in fluorescence suggests the entrance into the vesicle of Na+, cotransported with the sugar. This would lead to the interior of the membrane vesicle becoming more positive, resulting in depolarization of the membrane potential. That the sugar induced the transport of Na+ was confirmed by direct measurement of 22Na+ uptake. Thus, the Na+-sugar co-transport system provides a mechanism for D-glucose to stimulate the flux of Na+ as well as for the Na+ electrochemical gradient to enhance the transport of D-glucose."
https://openalex.org/W1613952938,High mobility group proteins were isolated from calf thymus and duck erythrocyte nuclei and the possibility was investigated that these proteins undergo acetylation similar to that occurring in some histones. Dinitrophenylation of the proteins followed by acid hydrolysis and amino acid analysis indicated that 2 to 3% of the lysine residues present were unavailable for reaction with fluorodinitrobenzene. Extensive enzymatic degradation with trypsin and pronase and subsequent amino acid analysis showed a significant amount of material eluting at the position of epsilon-N-acetyllysine. Recovery and acid hydrolysis of this material generated a peak eluting in the lysine position. In vitro radioactive labeling of calf thymus nuclei with [3H]acetate yielded labeled high mobility group proteins. All of these findings are in accord with the conclusion that high mobility group proteins are acetylated and that acetylation occurs as a postsynthetic modification of these proteins.

Amylase mRNA lev- els were measured by two specific assays: hybridiza- tion with amylase cDNA and specific immunoprecipi- tation of amylase synthesized in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system. The levels of other frequent pancreatic mRNAs were examined qualitatively by hy- bridization with cDNA synthesized from total adult pancreas polyadenylated RNA and by comparison of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel patterns of in vitro translation products. Both hybridization and translation analyses indicate that total RNA isolated from dexamethasone-treated embryonic pancreases contains about twice as much amylse mRNA as does total RNA isolated from controls. Amylase specific activity is about 4-fold greater in dexamethasone-treated pancreases than in controls. Thus, dexamethasone increases amylase specific activ- ity in part by increasing the steady state level of amy- lase mRNA. Amylase mRNA synthesized in the pres- ence of dexamethasone is identified as pancreatic am- ylase mRNA (rather than an amylase mRNA of differ- ent nucleotide sequence normally synthesized in an- other tissue such as the parotid gland or liver) by the thermal stability of the cDNA-RNA hybrids. Dexameth- asone does not change significantly the amount of total mRNA relative to non-mRNA sequences or steady state levels of most other frequent mRNAs. RNA isolated from BrdUrd-treated embryonic pan- creases contains about 3% of the control value of amy- lase mRNA and greatly reduced levels (<8%) of mRNAs which code primarily for other exocrine proteins. At the levels of BrdUrd employed the specific activities of amylase and other exocrine proteins are reduced to about 3% of control values. The total amount of mRNA relative to non-mRNA sequences is relatively unaf- fected.

Studies by isoelectric focusing on Ampholine plate gel revealed that the solutions of the halfway reduced methemoglobin are composed of about 6% oxyhemoglobin, 59% intermediate hemoglobin, and 35% methemoglobin. The intermediate hemoglobin was isolated by CM Sephadex C-50 column chromatography and identified as alpha3+beta2+ valency hybrid by studies using the pattern of isoelectric focusing of p-chloromercuribenzoate-treated intermediate hemoglobin on Ampholine plate gel, absorption spectra, and difference spectra induced by the addition of inositol hexaphosphate in comparison with the reconstituted valency hybrids, alpha3+beta2+ and alpha2+beta3+. Essentially no alpha2+beta3+ valency hybrid was included in the intermediate hemoglobin solutions. These results suggest that methemoglobin reduction by ascorbic acid is mainly initiated by the attack of beta-methemoglobin chains accompanied by the following scheme. Methemoglobin leads to alpha3+beta2+ valency hybrid leads to oxyhemoglobin. The course of methemoglobin reduction by ascorbic acid through alpha2+beta3+ is likely to be small."

The phase containing alpha3+beta2+ valency hybrid reduction to deoxyhemoglobin was not affected by the presence of this organic phosphate. The reaction rate constant of each phase was estimated by the analysis of the changes in three components such as methemoglobin, alpha3+beta2+ valency hybrid, and deoxyhemoglobin.

Active cells were heterogeneous in their susceptibility to inhibition by 0.1 micron cytochalasin B, half of them being inhibited about 95%, while half were inhibited modestly. The methylglucose entry Km of quiescent cells was 3 times that of active and stimulated cells. The methylglucose entry Vmax of quiescent cells was one-eighth that of stimulated cells. A fixed internal methylglucose concentration increased the influx Km of quiescent cells but not that of active or stimulated cells. These findings and others are compatible with a model in which the carrier of quiescent cells is masked by an alteration (such as ligand binding) which is relatively specific for empty as opposed to sugar-loaded carrier and rather indifferent as to in versus out carrier orientation. The masking alteration stabilizes inward-facing and outward-facing unloaded carrier against both translocation and loading. The data fail to show evidence of a masking alteration of loaded carrier."

However, 2-pyrrolidone was the major product of the metabolism of putrescine secreted into the medium. 2-Pyrrolidone was also synthesized from putrescine by spleen and lung, but not by kidney, brain, heart, or muscle. This is the first demonstration of the synthesis of 2-pyrrolidone in a biological system."
https://openalex.org/W1480618453,"The reduction of cytochrome o which contains two hemes/molecule required two electrons/molecule when titrated with dithionite under anaerobic conditions. Two types of spectral transitions occurred during this reduction, first a decrease in absorption bands for the oxidized protein at 540 and 405 nm and then a shift in the absorption maxima to 555 and 425 nm, respectively. Each of these two transitions required approximately one electron, evidence that the two hemes reduced separately. Preliminary estimates of the midpoint potentials of the two hemes enabled the selection of two suitable oxidation-reduction dyes, toluylene blue (E'o = +0.115 V) and indigo carmine (E'o = -0.125 V) which were used to estimate more accurately the midpoint potentials of the high and low potential hemes, respectively, using equilibrium photochemical titrations with EDTA and flavin mononucleotide. The midpoint potentials of the two hemes of cytochrome o determined by this technique were +0.118 and -0.122 V."
https://openalex.org/W1561489656,"When clone 745 Friend erythroleukemia cells are induced to differentiate by treatment with 1 X 10(-4) M hemin, the beta minor globin gene is preferentially expressed over the beta major gene. An analysis of the beta-mRNA molecules in in vitro translation systems indicates that essentially only the beta minor message is available for translation. This indicates that in Friend erythroleukemia cells hemin selectively controls the expression of the beta minor globin gene at the pretranslational level."
https://openalex.org/W1631646224,"The sequence of the NH2-terminal 35 residues of chicken ovalbumin was found to be identical with that of the product translated in vitro from the corresponding mRNA. Together with our previous results (Palmiter, R.D., Gagnon, J., and Walsh, K.A. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75, 94-98), these data show that the only co-translational processing event at the NH2 terminus of the primary translation product is the replacement of the initiator methionine by an acetyl group. Thus, secretion of this major protein by chick oviduct does not involve the cleavage of a signal peptide as is characteristic of three other egg white proteins secreted by the same cells."

https://openalex.org/W1489112197,"The paramagnetically shiftedd proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of iron-cobalt hybrid hemoglobins [alpha(Co)2beta(Fe)2 and alpha(Fe)2beta(Co)2], as well as those of deoxy forms of cobalt hemoglobin, iron hemoglobin, and their isolated chains, have been measured at 360 MHz. The proton NMR signals of the deoxy forms of iron and cobalt hemoglobins were individually assigned to each subunit. The NMR spectral characteristics of the alpha subunits in deoxycobalt hemoglobin, as well as those in deoxy-alpha(Co)2beta(Fe)2, were found to be quite different from those of beta(Co)2 subunits or isolated alpha-SH chain. Upon ligation of carbon monoxide to the beta(Fe)2 subunits in alpha(Co)2beta(Fe)2, the spectral properties of deoxy-alpha(Co)2 subunits became similar to those of the deoxy-beta(Co)2 subunits. No significant change in the NMR spectrum of the beta(Co)2 subunits was observed in alpha(Fe)2beta(Co)2 upon ligation of carbon monoxide to the alpha(Fe)2 subunits. These observations show the linkage of the electronic structure of the prosthetic groups with the subunits cooperativity in hemoglobin, as well as the inequivalence of the subunits. This is the first report on the paramagnetically shifte proton NMR spectra of the cobalt-substituted hemoproteins."

The band could be resolved into two components by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels. All highly purified preparations of discoidin I contained equal amounts of the two components, suggesting they are nonidentical subunits of the protein. The subunit molecular weights of discoidin I and discoidin II were found to be 29,500 and 26,500, values somewhat larger than those previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W1599573996,"Sedimentation equilibrium studies show that there are two forms of bovine liver rhodanese in crystalline enzyme preparations of full specific activity. One form dissociates to a species with a limiting molecular weight close to 19,000. The second form is nondissociable under the same experimental conditions. It exhibits a molecular weight of approximately 33,000. These conclusions are augmented by data from polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular exclusion chromatography. They serve to explain apparent inconsistencies in previous reports on this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1517083063,"Recombinant plasmid DNA has been used to purify complementary cDNA by hybridization using a modification of sulfhydryl-Sepharose chromatography described by Dale and Ward ((1975) Biochemistry 14, 2458). Plasmid DNA containing cloned mouse globin or immunoglobulin sequences was mercurated and hybridized in solution to unpurified cDNA. The resulting hybrids were passed over a sulfhydryl-Sepharose column where mercurated polynucleotides are retained. After washing, cDNA hybridized to the mercurated plasmid DNA was melted in situ and eluted while the mercurated plasmid DNA remained bound to the column. The conditions for purification of DNA and RNA sequences are described. The purity of the cDNAs obtained by this method is analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by hybridization. In addition, this nucleic acid purification procedure has been applied to two problems of general interest: (i) the sensitive titration of specific genes by saturation hybridization; (ii) the purification of DNA fragments bearing specific sequences from restriction endonuclease digests of total cellular DNA. The procedure is generally applicable to the purification by hybridization of any DNA or RNA sequence complementary to an available probe."

https://openalex.org/W108694661,"The kinetic properties of rabbit liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferase were examined. Our results indicate that incorporation of AMP into tRNA-C-C at pH 9.4 proceeds by a rapid equilibrium Random Bi Bi mechanism. This conclusion was supported by bisubstrate initial velocity studies, dead end and product inhibition, and isotope exchange at equilibrium and during the net reaction. This analysis has made possible calculation of the dissociation constants of various substrates and substrate analogs. The data indicate that binding of either a substrate or substrate analog greatly decreases the affinity of the enzyme for the second substrate. Comparison of binding constants for tRNAs revealed that affinities for the enzyme are tRNA-C-C greater than tRNA-C-Cp greater than tRNA-C-C-A. Also, ATP binds considerably more tightly than ADP. The apparent equilibrium constant of the forward reaction was determined and found to be about 1500 at pH 9.4, and about 50 at pH 7.0. Analysis of the reaction at pH 7.0 suggested that it proceeds by a similar mechanism, but that the dissociation of tRNA-C-C-A becomes more important. The relation of these in vitro properties of the enzyme to its cellular function are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W184113128,"Determinations of carbon monoxide binding curves for hemoglobin from Brevoortia tyrannus under equilibrium and photostationary conditions show that in the light, the curve is shifted to the right and altered in shape. The Bohr effect is much less in the light. The kinetics of the transition between equilibrium and photostationary states has been examined. All of the results are satisfactorily described using the two-state model of Monod, J. Wyman, J., and Changeux, J.P. (1965) J. Mol. Biol. 12, 88-118 with the assumption that light produces an additive increase in the rate of dissociation of ligand from the R and T states."
