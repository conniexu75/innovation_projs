https://openalex.org/W2157144502,"Atmospheric general circulation models used for climate simulation and weather forecasting require the fluxes of radiation, heat, water vapor, and momentum across the land-atmosphere interface to be specified. These fluxes are calculated by submodels called land surface parameterizations. Over the last 20 years, these parameterizations have evolved from simple, unrealistic schemes into credible representations of the global soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer system as advances in plant physiological and hydrological research, advances in satellite data interpretation, and the results of large-scale field experiments have been exploited. Some modern schemes incorporate biogeochemical and ecological knowledge and, when coupled with advanced climate and ocean models, will be capable of modeling the biological and physical responses of the Earth system to global change, for example, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide."
https://openalex.org/W2127314810,"The interleukin-1β (IL-1β) converting enzyme (ICE) processes the inactive IL-1β precursor to the proinflammatory cytokine. ICE was also shown to cleave the precursor of interferon-γ inducing factor (IGIF) at the authentic processing site with high efficiency, thereby activating IGIF and facilitating its export. Lipopolysaccharide-activated ICE-deficient (ICE −/− ) Kupffer cells synthesized the IGIF precursor but failed to process it into the active form. Interferon-γ and IGIF were diminished in the sera of ICE −/− mice exposed to Propionibacterium acnes and lipopolysaccharide. The lack of multiple proinflammatory cytokines in ICE −/− mice may account for their protection from septic shock."
https://openalex.org/W2086008721,"The nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factor is responsive to specific cytokines and stress and is often activated in association with cell damage and growth arrest in eukaryotes. NF-kappaB is a heterodimeric protein, typically composed of 50- and 65-kilodalton subunits of the Rel family, of which RelA(p65) stimulates transcription of diverse genes. Specific cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) were found to regulate transcriptional activation by NF-kappaB through interactions with the coactivator p300. The transcriptional activation domain of RelA(p65) interacted with an amino-terminal region of p300 distinct from a carboxyl-terminal region of p300 required for binding to the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex. The CDK inhibitor p21 or a dominant negative Cdk2, which inhibited p300-associated cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, stimulated kappaB-dependent gene expression, which was also enhanced by expression of p300 in the presence of p21. The interaction of NF-kappaB and CDKs through the p300 and CBP coactivators provides a mechanism for the coordination of transcriptional activation with cell cycle progression."

The hot spots for different species groups rarely overlap, except where anthropogenic activities reduce natural habitat in centers of endemism. Conserving endangered plant species maximizes the incidental protection of all other species groups. The presence of endangered birds and herptiles, however, provides a more sensitive indication of overall endangered biodiversity within any region. The amount of land that needs to be managed to protect currently endangered and threatened species in the United States is a relatively small proportion of the land mass."

A mutant in the annual legume Medicago truncatula exhibits an increase of more than an order of magnitude in the number of persistent rhizobial infections. Physiological and genetic analyses indicate that this same mutation confers insensitivity to the plant hormone ethylene for multiple aspects of plant development, including nodulation. These data support the hypothesis that ethylene is a component of the signaling pathway controlling rhizobial infection of legumes."
https://openalex.org/W2022687427,"Lymphocyte-specific interferon regulatory factor (LSIRF) (now called IRF4) is a transcription factor expressed only in lymphocytes. Mice deficient in IRF4 showed normal distribution of B and T lymphocyes at 4 to 5 weeks of age but developed progressive generalized lymphadenopathy. IRF4-deficient mice exhibited a profound reduction in serum immunoglobulin concentrations and did not mount detectable antibody responses. T lymphocyte function was also impaired in vivo; these mice could not generate cytotoxic or antitumor responses. Thus, IRF4 is essential for the function and homeostasis of both mature B and mature T lymphocytes."

The present study was designed to elucidate the effect of NO pre-exposure on TNFα-induced hepatotoxicity. Pretreatment of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) induced the expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) mRNA and protein, which was associated with thermotolerance and cytoprotection from TNFα+actinomycin D-induced hepatotoxicity and apoptosis. SNAP transiently changed the intracellular redox state by inducing glutathione (GSH) oxidation associated with the formation of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). HSP70 mRNA was also induced by the GSH-oxidizing agent diamide and the GSH-conjugating agent N-ethylmaleimide, suggesting that NO induces HSP70 expression through GSH oxidation.The protective effect of SNAP pretreatment on TNFα-induced apoptosis correlated with the level of HSP70 expression. SNAP pretreatment inhibited reactive oxygen intermediate generation and lipid peroxidation effects that were reversed by blocking HSP70 expression using an antisense oligonucleotide to HSP70. Finally, endogenous NO formation, induced in hepatocytes stimulated with interferon-γ and interleukin-1β, led to the formation of GSNO and GSSG, induced HSP70, and attenuated TNFα-mediated cytotoxicity. These findings demonstrated that NO can induce resistance to TNFα-induced hepatotoxicity, possibly through the stimulation of HSP70 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2028462347,"A new paradigm for oxygen activation is required for enzymes such as methane monooxygenase (MMO), for which catalysis depends on a nonheme diiron center instead of the more familiar Fe-porphyrin cofactor. On the basis of precedents from synthetic diiron complexes, a high-valent Fe 2 (μ-O) 2 diamond core has been proposed as the key oxidizing species for MMO and other nonheme diiron enzymes such as ribonucleotide reductase and fatty acid desaturase. The presence of a single short Fe-O bond (1.77 angstroms) per Fe atom and an Fe-Fe distance of 2.46 angstroms in MMO reaction intermediate Q, obtained from extended x-ray absorption fine structure and Mössbauer analysis, provides spectroscopic evidence that the diiron center in Q has an Fe 2 IV O 2 diamond core."

The formation of blood clots (thrombosis) within the tumor vessels was initiated by targeting the cell surface domain of human tissue factor, by means of a bispecific antibody, to an experimentally induced marker on tumor vascular endothelial cells. This truncated form of tissue factor (tTF) had limited ability to initiate thrombosis when free in the circulation, but became an effective and selective thrombogen when targeted to tumor endothelial cells. Intravenous administration of the antibody-tTF complex to mice with large neuroblastomas resulted in complete tumor regressions in 38 percent of the mice."
https://openalex.org/W1991833325,"Oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) may be of central importance in triggering atherosclerosis. One potential pathway involves the production of nitric oxide (NO) by vascular wall endothelial cells and macrophages. NO reacts with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−), a potent agent of LDL oxidation in vitro. ONOO− nitrates the aromatic ring of free tyrosine to produce 3-nitrotyrosine, a stable product. To explore the role of reactive nitrogen species such as ONOO− in the pathogenesis of vascular disease, we developed a highly sensitive and specific method involving gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to quantify 3-nitrotyrosine levels in proteins. In vitro studies demonstrated that 3-nitrotyrosine was a highly specific marker for LDL oxidized by ONOO−. LDL isolated from the plasma of healthy subjects had very low levels of 3-nitrotyrosine (9 ± 7 μmol/mol of tyrosine). In striking contrast, LDL isolated from aortic atherosclerotic intima had 90-fold higher levels (840 ± 140 μmol/mol of tyrosine). These observations strongly support the hypothesis that reactive nitrogen species such as ONOO− form in the human artery wall and provide direct evidence for a specific reaction pathway that promotes LDL oxidation in vivo. The detection of 3-nitrotyrosine in LDL isolated from vascular lesions raises the possibility that NO, by virtue of its ability to form reactive nitrogen intermediates, may promote atherogenesis, counteracting the well-established anti-atherogenic effects of NO.

However, a wealth of evidence suggests that LDL must be oxidatively modified to damage the artery wall (1Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar, 2Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Pathways that oxidize lipid and protein may thus be pivotal to the development of atherosclerosis. LDL oxidation has been widely studied in vitro, but the mechanisms that promote oxidation within the artery wall remain poorly understood (2Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar).We have described one potential pathway for LDL oxidation that involves oxidants generated by myeloperoxidase, an enzyme secreted by phagocytes (3Daugherty A. Dunn J.L. Rateri D.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Another pathway involves nitrogen monoxide (nitric oxide; NO) generated by vascular wall cells (4Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5687) Google Scholar). NO is a relatively stable free radical that fails to oxidize LDL at physiological pH (5Jessup W. Mohr D. Giesig S.P. Dean R.T. Stocker R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, NO reacts rapidly with superoxide to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−; 6Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6666) Google Scholar), a reactive nitrogen species that promotes peroxidation of the lipid moiety of LDL in vitro (7Graham A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. O'Leary V. Darley-Usmar Moncada S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Cultured endothelial cells, macrophages and smooth muscle cells, all components of the atherosclerotic lesion, generate superoxide anion (2Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), suggesting that ONOO− or other reactive nitrogen intermediates derived from NO could form in the artery wall.In vitro studies demonstrate that ONOO− spontaneously reacts with tyrosine residues to yield the stable product 3-nitrotyrosine (Scheme 1; 8Beckman J.S. Chen J. Ischiropoulos H. Crow J.P. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (963) Google Scholar). Macrophages and endothelial cells may play a role because antibodies for 3-nitrotyrosine detect epitopes in human atherosclerotic lesions that are associated predominantly with these two cell types (9Beckman S.J. Ye Y.Z. Anderson P.G. Chen J. Accavitti M-A. Tarpey M.M. White R. Biol Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not quantify levels of 3-nitrotyrosine or evaluate the extent of LDL nitration.To explore the role of reactive nitrogen species in oxidative damage in vivo, we developed a quantitative assay for measuring levels of 3-nitrotyrosine. The method combines gas chromatography with stable isotope dilution mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Using this assay, we first investigated the relative yields of protein-bound oxidation products in bovine serum albumin (BSA) and LDL that were oxidized with ONOO− in vitro. In both cases, the major product was 3-nitrotyrosine. Other widely studied oxidation systems failed to generate significant levels of 3-nitrotyrosine in LDL. These observations indicate that 3-nitrotyrosine is a specific marker for oxidative damage by reactive nitrogen intermediates. We then demonstrated that 3-nitrotyrosine levels are highly elevated in LDL isolated from human atherosclerotic tissue. These observations implicate reactive nitrogen species as one pathway for LDL oxidation in the artery wall.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we examined the potential role of reactive nitrogen species in LDL oxidation. In vitro studies demonstrated that 3-nitrotyrosine was a highly specific marker for LDL oxidized by ONOO−, a reactive nitrogen species. Analysis of LDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions revealed a remarkable 90-fold elevation of the level of 3-nitrotyrosine compared with that in circulating LDL. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that reactive nitrogen intermediates derived from NO contribute to LDL oxidation in the artery wall.A key question is whether NO generation by cells of the artery wall promotes or inhibits the development of atherosclerotic plaque. Cultured endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells generate superoxide (2Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), which may rapidly react with NO to form ONOO− (6Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6666) Google Scholar). Moreover, ONOO− peroxidizes the lipid moieties of LDL in vitro, converting the lipoprotein to a form that is recognized by the macrophage scavenger receptor (7Graham A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. O'Leary V. Darley-Usmar Moncada S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Unregulated uptake of such modified lipoprotein may play a role in cholesterol accumulation by macrophages, a critical early step in atherogenesis (1Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (2462) Google Scholar, 2Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). In keeping with this hypothesis, our detection of elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine in LDL isolated from atherosclerotic lesions suggests that reactive nitrogen intermediates derived from NO may indeed promote atherosclerotic vascular disease.In contrast, other studies have shown that NO inhibits LDL oxidation by cultured macrophages (2Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar, 5Jessup W. Mohr D. Giesig S.P. Dean R.T. Stocker R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and that NO may act as a chain-breaking antioxidant during lipid peroxidation (19Rubbo H. Parthasarathy S. Barnes S. Kirk M. Kalyanaraman B. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). NO also may exert other anti-atherogenic effects in vivo, including inhibition of platelet aggregation and suppression of smooth muscle cell proliferation (4Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5687) Google Scholar). Studies in hypercholesterolemic rabbits suggest that NO inhibits fatty streak formation, the cellular hallmark of the early atherosclerotic lesion (22Cooke J.P. Tsao P.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 653-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that NO is anti-atherogenic in this animal model.These apparently conflicting findings could be explained if the relatively stable free radical NO exerts potent anti-atherogenic effects while reactive intermediates derived from NO damage artery wall targets. The availability of superoxide may be critical in controlling this balance. Superoxide would both remove anti-atherogenic NO and produce pro-atherogenic ONOO−. Thus, an imbalance in the pro- and anti-atherogenic effects of NO may be one important factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular disease.

In keeping with this hypothesis, our detection of elevated levels of 3-nitrotyrosine in LDL isolated from atherosclerotic lesions suggests that reactive nitrogen intermediates derived from NO may indeed promote atherosclerotic vascular disease.In contrast, other studies have shown that NO inhibits LDL oxidation by cultured macrophages (2Berliner J.A.

Kalyanaraman B. Freeman B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). NO also may exert other anti-atherogenic effects in vivo, including inhibition of platelet aggregation and suppression of smooth muscle cell proliferation (4Moncada S. Higgs A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 2002-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (5687) Google Scholar). Studies in hypercholesterolemic rabbits suggest that NO inhibits fatty streak formation, the cellular hallmark of the early atherosclerotic lesion (22Cooke J.P. Tsao P.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 653-655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that NO is anti-atherogenic in this animal model.These apparently conflicting findings could be explained if the relatively stable free radical NO exerts potent anti-atherogenic effects while reactive intermediates derived from NO damage artery wall targets. The availability of superoxide may be critical in controlling this balance. Superoxide would both remove anti-atherogenic NO and produce pro-atherogenic ONOO−. Thus, an imbalance in the pro- and anti-atherogenic effects of NO may be one important factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular disease. In this study, we examined the potential role of reactive nitrogen species in LDL oxidation. In vitro studies demonstrated that 3-nitrotyrosine was a highly specific marker for LDL oxidized by ONOO−, a reactive nitrogen species. Analysis of LDL isolated from human atherosclerotic lesions revealed a remarkable 90-fold elevation of the level of 3-nitrotyrosine compared with that in circulating LDL. These observations strongly support the hypothesis that reactive nitrogen intermediates derived from NO contribute to LDL oxidation in the artery wall. A key question is whether NO generation by cells of the artery wall promotes or inhibits the development of atherosclerotic plaque. Cultured endothelial cells, macrophages, and smooth muscle cells generate superoxide (2Berliner J.A. Heinecke J.W. Free Radical Biol. & Med. 1996; 20: 707-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), which may rapidly react with NO to form ONOO− (6Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P.A. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1620-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (6666) Google Scholar). Moreover, ONOO− peroxidizes the lipid moieties of LDL in vitro, converting the lipoprotein to a form that is recognized by the macrophage scavenger receptor (7Graham A. Hogg N. Kalyanaraman B. O'Leary V. Darley-Usmar Moncada S. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar).

A biologically active OSM receptor has been previously described that consists of a heterodimer of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) and gp130.

The signaling capability of specific receptor subunit combinations was analyzed by independent assays measuring cell proliferation or induction of acute phase protein synthesis. Our results demonstrate that both LIF and OSM cause tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the gp130·LIFR combination, but the gp130·OSMRβ complex is activated by OSM only.

LIF and OSM also share pleiotrophic biological activities. Among these are the ability to induce differentiation of the murine myeloid leukemic cell line, M1 (6Bruce A.G. Hoggatt I.H. Rose T.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1271-1275PubMed Google Scholar), a property also shared with IL-6 and G-CSF. LIF and OSM inhibit differentiation of embryonic stem cells in vitro at comparable dose ranges (7Rose T.M. Weiford D.M. Gunderson N.L. Bruce A.G.

Taga T. Kishimoto T. Nakamura S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Biological effects of many of the IL-6 family of cytokines are mediated through cell-surface multimeric receptors involving cytokine-specific subunits and a common signaling subunit, gp130 (reviewed by 20Kishimoto T. Akira S. Narazaki M. Taga T. Blood. 1995; 86: 1243-1254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, assembly of a functional LIF receptor (21Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) involves ligand binding to the LIF receptor (LIFR) with low affinity followed by association with gp130 to form a high affinity signal transducing heterodimeric complex (Fig. 1). Although gp130 functions as the high affinity converting and signaling subunit in the receptor complexes for a number of cytokines (LIF, IL-6, IL-11, CNTF, and CT-1), OSM is the only one of this group of cytokines that can bind specifically and directly to gp130 with low affinity (21Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D.

Modrell B. Aruffo A. Marken J.S. Taga T. Yasukawa K. Murakami M. Kishimoto T. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16763-16766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), association of LIFR with the low affinity OSM·gp130 complex forms a high affinity OSM signal transducing receptor (21Gearing D.P. Comeau M.R. Friend D.J. Gimpel S.D. Thut C.J. McGourty J. Brasher K.K. King J.A. Gillis S. Mosley B. Ziegler S.F. Cosman D. Science. 1992; 255: 1434-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) described as the LIF/OSM receptor or type I OSM receptor (24Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, both OSM and LIF utilize a heterodimeric gp130·LIFR complex capable of transducing signaling events after either LIF or OSM binding. This signal transducing gp130·LIFR combination is also utilized by two other known cytokines, CT-1 (25Pennica D. Shaw K.J. Swanson T.A. Moore M.W. Shelton D.L. Zioncheck K.A. Rosenthal A. Taga T. Paoni N.F. Wood W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10915-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and CNTF. However, CNTF first binds to a specific low affinity receptor (CNTFR) before forming the high affinity CNTFR·LIFR·gp130 complex (26Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 27Stahl N. Davis S. Wong V. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol.

On a number of cell types, however, high affinity functional OSM receptors have been observed that are incapable of binding LIF and represent a second OSM-specific receptor system (24Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Gearing D.P. Bruce A.G. New Biol. 1992; 4: 61-65PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of OSM/gp130 interaction with antibodies to gp130 blocks signal transduction through the OSM-specific receptor as well as through the shared receptor (23Liu J. Modrell B. Aruffo A. Marken J.S. Taga T. Yasukawa K. Murakami M. Kishimoto T. Shoyab M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16763-16766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that additional subunits are required for the OSM·gp130 complex to form high affinity signaling receptor complexes. The OSM-specific receptor, or type II OSM receptor (24Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while utilizing the OSM·gp130 complex, must include a second as yet uncharacterized subunit distinct from LIFR. Interactions between OSM and various receptor subunit combinations are shown schematically in Fig. 1. This dual OSM receptor system provides an explanation for numerous OSM biological activities, some of which are shared by LIF and some of which are OSM-specific. Utilizing the high degree of homology among the signaling components in the gp130 receptor family, we have successfully cloned, through degenerate PCR, a novel hematopoietin receptor which we call the oncostatin M-specific receptor β subunit or OSMRβ. This subunit, which does not directly bind any cytokine we tested, associates with the low affinity OSM·gp130 complex to form a high affinity heterodimeric receptor that is capable of transducing OSM-specific signaling events. The pool of sense orientation degenerate oligonucleotides TT(T/G)(C/A)(G/A)(G/T)(A/G)T(T/A)CG(C/G/T)(T/A)G(T/C) and antisense oligonucleotides (A/G)CTCCA(G/T)T(C/T)(G/A)CTCCA were used to perform PCR amplification utilizing human genomic DNA (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) as template. Amplification was performed in 100-μl reactions with 200 ng of DNA template under standard salt conditions (Perkin-Elmer Corp.). Optimal PCR conditions were denaturation for 1 min at 94°C, annealing for 3 min at 50°C, and polymerization for 1 min at 72°C for 35 cycles. PCR products were blunted with T4 polymerase, kinased, and phenol/chloroform-extracted before separation on a 6% low melting point agarose gel. Fragments approximately 50 base pairs in length were subcloned into Bluescript SK previously linearized with EcoRV and dephosphorylated. Individual transformants were transferred to single wells in 96-well microtiter trays, amplified, and frozen in 20% glycerol at −70°C. Individual clones were amplified, and insert DNA was sequenced on an Applied Biosystems Automated DNA sequencer. A specific sequence oligonucleotide (5′-GCTGATGCCAGCCACTTCTGGAAA-3′) was used as a kinased oligonucleotide probe to screen previously described cDNA libraries according to standard procedures (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.85Google Scholar). Hybridization conditions were essentially as described (30Goodwin R.G. Lupton S. Schmierer A. Hjerrild K.J. Jerzy R. Clevenger W. Gillis S. Cosman D. Namen A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Positive isolates were identified following high stringency washing conditions (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 63°C). DNA sequences were obtained using vector- and cDNA-derived oligonucleotide primers on denatured double-stranded templates following subcloning according to standard procedures (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Ford N. Nolan C. Ferguson M. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.85Google Scholar). Generation of BAF-B03 cell lines expressing gp130 and gp130/LIFR has been described (31Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To create a cell line expressing gp130 and OSMRβ, full-length OSMRβ cDNA was subcloned into the expression vector pDC411 derived from the previously described pDC409 vector (32Giri J.G. Ahdieh M. Eisenman J. Shanebeck K. Grabstein K. Kumaki S. Namen A. Park L.S. Cosman D. Anderson D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2822-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar), modified to contain the hygromycin resistance gene, and electroporated into BAF-gp130 cells. A drug-resistant BAF cell line expressing gp130 and OSMRβ was selected by limiting dilution. To measure proliferation, transfected BAF cells were cultured in 96-well microtiter plates (1 × 104 cells per well, 0.2 ml per well) with test samples for 72 h and pulse-labeled with [3H]thymidine (0.5 mCi per well) for 5 h. Cells were harvested on glass filters, and cell-associated radioactivity was measured by a scintillation counter. A rabbit antiserum directed against OSMRβ was obtained by nine subsequent immunizations of New Zealand White rabbits with a protein consisting of the hematopoietin domains of OSMRβ fused to the Fc domain of human IgG (described below). For generating mAbs, Balb/c mice were immunized three times with 15 μg of OSMRβ-Fc in RIBI adjuvant (Ribi Corp., Hamilton, MT). Two weeks after the last immunization, mice were boosted intravenously with 5 μg of OSMR-Fc. Three days later the mice were sacrificed, and spleen cells were fused to Ag8.653 myeloma cells (ATCC) with 50% polyethylene glycol, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide solution (Sigma). Hybridoma supernatants were screened by antibody capture assay (ABC). Briefly, 96-well plates (Flow) were coated overnight with goat anti-mouse Ig (Zymed) and then washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20. Supernatants were incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then washed four times with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. OSMRβ-Fc:biotin was then added to each well for 1 h, followed by four washes. Streptavidin was added for 15 min. The plates were washed again and developed with 3,3‘,5,5‘-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). After developing, the plates were read on a plate reader at 650 nm. Positive wells were subsequently screened to remove antibodies reactive with human Ig. Positive cells were cloned and grown in bulk in culture. Supernatants were purified over a protein A column (Bio-Rad) and stored at −20°C. Gene splicing by overlap extension (33Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) was utilized to fuse the haptoglobin promoter region from nucleotides −165 to +25 (34Bensi G. Raugei G. Klefenz H. Cortese R.

Five million Hep3B or HepG2 cells per well were plated in six-well culture plates (Costar) and allowed to adhere overnight. Two micrograms of DNA (equivalent amounts of each component in heterogeneous mixtures) were transfected with lipofectamine essentially as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, expression of IL-2Rα on the cell surface was determined essentially as described (36Mitcham J.L. Parnet P. Bonnert T.P. Garka K.E. Gerhart M.J. Slack J.L. Gayle M.A. Dower S.K. Sims J.E.

DNA encoding the hematopoietin receptor domains of gp130, LIFR, and OSMRβ was each fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (gp130-Fc, LIFR-Fc, and OSMRβ-Fc, respectively) and expressed in CV-1/EBNA cells as described (38Fanslow W.C.

Radiolabeled ligand (1 × 10−9 M) was incubated for 18 h at 4°C with 500 μl of CV-1/EBNA conditioned supernatant and 25 μl of protein-A Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) as prepared by the manufacturer's directions. Sepharose beads were washed once with PBS and purified over a 1-ml pad of 5% glucose in PBS. Radioactivity associated with the purified beads was quantitated on a gamma counter. Binding studies with BAF-BO3 cell lines expressing gp130 and gp130/OSMRβ were performed as described previously (31Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Messenger RNA was isolated, blotted onto nylon membranes, and probed essentially as described (30Goodwin R.G. Lupton S. Schmierer A. Hjerrild K.J. Jerzy R. Clevenger W. Gillis S. Cosman D. Namen A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized overnight with 32P-labeled riboprobes from the entire coding region and washed using high stringency conditions (see above). Functional receptors for IL-6 family cytokines are multisubunit complexes involving related molecules that are all members of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily. These receptors are distinguished by a 200-amino acid extracellular hematopoietin domain that is divided into two fibronectin type III modules. The amino-terminal module contains two cysteine pairs with the cysteine residues within each pair separated by 8-10 amino acids. Following a proline-rich hinge region, the second module contains a highly conserved Trp-Ser-X-Trp-Ser motif (39Cosman D. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Other than these features, sequence similarity is relatively low. A subset of hematopoietin receptors (including gp130, LIFR, and G-CSFR) which share higher overall homology are also distinct from other hematopoietin receptors in having three fibronectin type III repeats separating the hematopoietin domain from the transmembrane domain (LIFR also contains a second hematopoietin domain at the amino terminus). A number of homologous regions among these receptors have been identified (37Gearing D.P. Thut C.J. VandenBos T. Gimpel S.D. Delaney P.B. King J. Price V. Cosman D. Beckmann M.P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 40Larsen A. Davis T. Curtis B.M. Gimpel S. Sims J.E. Cosman D. Park L. Sorensen E. March C.J. Smith C.A. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Degenerate oligonucleotides were designed from a number of homologous regions between gp130, LIFR, and G-CSFR and tested for their ability to amplify each receptor by PCR. Nucleotide sequence options in the degenerate oligonucleotides were designed to allow all possible sequence variations among the members. Successful degenerate oligonucleotides were selected for sense and antisense orientation and redesigned to allow more sequence heterogeneity by incorporating sequences from the γ chain of the IL-2 receptor. The regions chosen for degenerate primers are structured around amino acids 296-300 (FRIRC) and 310-314 (WSDWS), respectively, of human gp130 (41Hibi M. Murakami M. Saito M. Hirano T. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). These oligos were then used to amplify PCR products from human genomic DNA. After subcloning, a library of individual PCR fragments was established. To analyze the quality of the library, DNA from 12 randomly chosen isolates was sequenced. Comparison of these sequences to known hematopoietin receptors showed sequences from gp130, LIFR, and two clones encoding a novel sequence showing strong homology to LIFR. An oligonucleotide specific for the novel sequence was used to screen three independent libraries generated from human placenta, a bone marrow stromal cell line (IMTLH), and a fibroblast cell line (WI-26 VA4). Comparison of overlapping clones Placenta 2B (Pl-2B), IMTLH-73 (IM-73), and WI-26 20B (WI-20B) (Fig. 2A) resulted in a 3096-base pair sequence containing a complete open reading frame encoding a protein of 979 amino acids (Fig. 2B). The predicted primary sequence includes a potential hydrophobic leader sequence (residues 1-27), the second half of a hematopoietin domain including a WSNWS motif (residues 28-150), an Ig-like domain (residues 151-240), a second complete hematopoietin domain containing four conserved cysteine residues, and a WSEWS sequence (residues 240-430) followed by three fibronectin type III repeats (residues 431-739) that are characteristic of this subset of hematopoietin receptors. This large extracellular domain is followed by a 22-amino acid transmembrane domain (residues 740-761) and a 218-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Comparison of this novel protein to gp130 and LIFR shows considerable homology in both domain structure and primary amino acid sequence. The general structure is identical to that of LIFR except that this molecule lacks the cysteine-containing module of the amino-terminal hematopoietin domain which is present in LIFR. Considering the homology in structure and expected homology in function of an OSM specific signaling subunit, we analyzed this molecule for its ability to initiate OSM-specific signaling events. The IL-3-dependent murine pre-B cell line, BAF-BO3, is commonly used to analyze the ability of cytokine receptors to mediate proliferative responses. These cells have been reported to have no gp130 and do not bind or proliferate in response to LIF or OSM (31Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc.

Cell. 1990; 63: 1149-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). Constructs encoding the various receptor subunits were transfected into BAF cells, and lines were selected that demonstrated stable expression of gp130, gp130 with LIFR (31Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), or gp130 with OSMRβ (BAF-gp130, BAF-gp130/LIFR, and BAF-gp130/OSMRβ, respectively). Fig. 3A shows the proliferative responses of these various cell lines after stimulation with 50 ng/ml LIF or OSM. As previously reported, untransfected or gp130 expressing BAF cells showed no proliferative response to either LIF or OSM. The BAF-gp130/LIFR cell line (expressing LIF/OSM or type I OSM receptors) is capable of proliferation after stimulation with either LIF or OSM. BAF-gp130/OSMRβ cells demonstrate a proliferative response after OSM stimulation but show no response to LIF. Antibodies (polyclonal and monoclonal) specific for the hematopoietin domain of OSMRβ were tested for their ability to inhibit the OSM-specific induction of BAF-gp130/OSMRβ proliferation. These antibodies effectively blocked the OSM-induced proliferation of these cells showing a requirement for a functional OSMRβ subunit in the signal transducing complex. Representative data from inhibition curves with anti-OSMRβ mAb M70 are shown in Fig. 3B. Complete inhibition of OSM-induced proliferation (up to 100 ng/ml) is achieved with antibody concentrations less than 500 ng/ml. Equilibrium binding studies were utilized to measure the binding parameters of OSM to parental BAF-B03 cells, BAF-gp130, and BAF-gp130/OSMRβ cells. In this and in a previous report (31Gearing D.P. Ziegler S.F. Comeau M.R. Friend D. Thoma B. Cosman D. Park L. Mosley B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1119-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), binding of OSM to parental BAF and BAF-gp130 was below detectable levels. Utilizing Biosensor technology, the binding affinity of OSM to gp130 has been measured at approximately 2 × 107 M−1 (data not shown) which may be undetectable on BAF-gp130 cells by standard Scatchard analysis. When OSMRβ was coexpressed with gp130 in the BAF cells, 125I-OSM binding was converted to high affinity. From an average of seven binding experiments on the BAF-gp130/OSMRβ cells, OSM displayed a binding affinity (Ka) of 2.8 ± 2.5 × 109 M−1 with 109 ± 73 total sites per cell (data not shown). This affinity is consistent with values derived from a variety of other cell types that express predominantly type II OSM receptors (19Murakami-Mori K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Nakamura S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1319-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Thoma B. Bird T.A. Friend D.J. Gearing D.P. Dower S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6215-6222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, binding of 125I-LIF to the BAF-gp130/OSMRβ cells was undetectable. Individual receptor components were tested for their capacity to bind to LIF or OSM through ligand binding to soluble versions of each molecule. Chimeric versions of gp130, LIFR, and OSMRβ were constructed in mammalian expression vectors with the extracellular ligand binding portions of each receptor fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 (gp130-Fc, LIFR-Fc, and OSMRβ-Fc, respectively) (38Fanslow W.C.

https://openalex.org/W2042921323,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) and MKP-2 are two members of a recently described family of dual specificity phosphatases that are capable of dephosphorylating p42/p44MAPK. Overexpression of MKP-1 or MKP-2 inhibits MAP kinase-dependent intracellular signaling events and fibroblast proliferation. By using specific antibodies that recognize endogenous MKP-1 and MKP-2 in CCL39 cells, we show that MKP-1 and MKP-2 are not expressed in quiescent cells, but are rapidly induced following serum addition, with protein detectable as early as 30 min (MKP-1) or 60 min (MKP-2). Serum induction of MKP-1 and MKP-2 is sustained, with protein detectable up to 14 h after serum addition. Induction of MKP-1 and, to a lesser extent, MKP-2 temporally correlates with p42/p44MAPK inactivation.To analyze the contribution of the MAP kinase cascade to MKP-1 and MKP-2 induction, we examined CCL39 cells transformed with either v-ras or a constitutively active direct upstream activator of MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MKK-1; MKK-1(SD/SD) mutant). In both cell models, MKP-1 and MKP-2 are constitutively expressed, with MKP-2 being prevalent. In addition, in CCL39 cells expressing an estradiol-inducible δRaf-1::ER chimera, activation of Raf alone is sufficient to induce MKP-1 and MKP-2. The role of the MAP kinase cascade in MKP induction was highlighted by the MKK-1 inhibitor PD 098059, which blunted both the activation of p42/p44MAPK and the induction of MKP-1 and MKP-2. However, the MAP kinase cascade is not absolutely required for the induction of MKP-1, as this phosphatase, but not MKP-2, was induced to detectable levels by agents that stimulate protein kinases A and C. Thus, activation of the p42/p44MAPK cascade promotes the induction of MKP-1 and MKP-2, which may then attenuate p42/p44MAPK-dependent events in an inhibitory feedback loop.

A major characteristic of protein phosphorylation is its reversibility. In the cell, a dynamic balance exists between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, resulting from interplay between protein phosphatases and protein kinases. As a consequence, a modification of either component is likely to have an equally important impact on signal transduction (1Dixon J.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 766: 18-22Google Scholar, 2Cohen P.

Protein phosphatases are generally classified into either serine/threonine or tyrosine phosphatases, depending on phosphoamino acid specificity. Dual specificity phosphatases capable of removing both phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine from protein targets are a relatively recent discovery. However, an ever increasing number of such phosphatases exist, including Cdc25, which dephosphorylates Thr14 and Tyr15 of Cdc2 (4Gautier J. Solomon M.J. Booher R.N. Bazan J.F. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1991; 67: 197-211Google Scholar), and Cdi1 (or KAP) (5Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Google Scholar, 6Poon R.Y. Hunter T.

Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1994; 5: 291-334Google Scholar). Sustained activation of the MAP kinase cascade is an absolute requirement for fibroblasts to exit from the quiescent G0 state and to pass the restriction point in G1. Thus, blockade of MAP kinase signaling with antisense MAP kinase constructs or dominant-negative MAP kinase molecules (25Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Google Scholar) or overexpression of MKP-1 (26Brondello J.-M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904Google Scholar) all prevent cell cycle reentry. The MAP kinase family is exemplified by three distinct subtypes: p42/p44MAPK (27Sturgill T.W. Wu J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1092: 350-357Google Scholar), p38MAPK (28Galcheva-Gargova Z. Dérijard B. Wu I.-H. Davis R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 806-808Google Scholar), and p46/p54JNK (29Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Google Scholar), which are predominately cytoplasmic proteins in quiescent cells. Upon stimulation, p42/p44MAPK and p46/p54JNK translocate to the nucleus, where they may phosphorylate nuclear transcription factors and thus regulate gene transcription (30Chen T.H. Sarnecki C. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 915-927Google Scholar, 31Lenormand P. Sardet C. Pagès G. L'Allemain G. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1079-1088Google Scholar, 32Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M. EMBO J. 1996; 14: 5957-5964Google Scholar). Full enzymatic activity of MAP kinase requires a dual phosphorylation on a Thr-X-Tyr motif, which is performed in vivo by specific upstream activators termed MAP kinase kinase (MKK-1/2, MKK-3/6, and MKK-4 for the p42/p44MAPK, p38MAPK, and p46/p54JNK enzymes, respectively) (33Ashworth A. Nakielny S. Cohen P. Marshall C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2555-2556Google Scholar, 34Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A. Barrett T. Dérijard D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Consequently, each MAP kinase family member is a candidate for dual dephosphorylation by MKPs. This raises the question of specificity between cognate kinase-phosphatase partners. However, previous studies have shown that MKP-1, MKP-2, MKP-3, and PAC1 (restricted to hematopoietic cell lines) are all able to inactivate p42/p44MAPK and that specificity is correspondingly low (8Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Google Scholar, 15Guan K.-L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Google Scholar, 19Muda M. Boschert U. Dickinson R. Martinou J.-C.

Nature. 1994; 367: 651-654Google Scholar). Several MKP family members were identified by virtue of their being encoded by immediate-early genes (10Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Google Scholar, 37Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190Google Scholar). With the exception of Pyst1 (23Groom L.A. Sneddon A.A. Alessi D.R. Dowd S. Keyse S.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 101-112Google Scholar), MKPs are not expressed in quiescent cells and may be induced upon stimulation with agonists that include mitogens, oxidative stress, heat shock, and UV irradiation (9Keyse S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1265: 152-160Google Scholar). Specificity of MKPs for the various MAP kinase members may therefore depend on their presence during a particular cellular event. An understanding of the mechanisms controlling MKP induction may explain how MAP kinase signaling pathways are regulated. We report that two dual specificity phosphatases (MKP-1 and MKP-2) may be induced in resting CCL39 fibroblasts following serum exposure. We have attempted to correlate their induction with the activity status of signal transduction pathways involving different MAP kinase family members. To this end, we investigated the level of MKP-1 and MKP-2 in cells expressing either constitutively active or inducible forms of each element of the Ras/Raf-1/MKK module. Our results suggest that activation of the p42/p44MAPK cascade is sufficient to promote the expression of MKP-1 and MKP-2. We propose that p42/p44MAPK down-regulation when cells progress through G1 is dependent on a feedback loop that involves MKP family members.

The established Chinese hamster lung fibroblast line CCL39 (American Type Culture Collection) and its derivatives (clones Ras5C and MKK-1(SD/SD)) were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 7.5% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. CCL39-derived δRaf-1::ER-expressing cells were cultivated in DMEM without phenol red in the presence of 7.5% fetal calf serum and G418 (400 μg/ml) (42Lenormand P. McMahon M. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15762-15768Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were cultivated in DMEM containing 7.5% decomplemented fetal calf serum. Cells were growth-arrested by serum starvation for 16-24 h. The EcoRI fragment of the full-length cDNA of CL100 (human MKP-1) previously introduced into the pECE vector (Stratagene) was digested by SmaI/XbaI and cloned into the pcDNAneoI mammalian expression vector (EcoRV and XbaI sites). The EcoRI/EcoRI fragment of the full-length cDNA of hVH-2 (human MKP-2) in the pBS vector was digested by BamHI/XhoI and cloned into the pcDNAneoI expression vector (BamHI and XhoI sites) (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells were seeded at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/well (six-well plate) and transfected the following day by the classical calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique with 10 μg of the corresponding construct (43Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed for Western blot analysis with Laemmli sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 12 C-terminal amino acids of 3CH134 protein (mouse MKP-1) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin was used for rabbit immunization. This antibody is referred to here as Alb-1. The specificity of Alb-1 was tested by Western blotting using cell lysates from HEK 293 cells transfected with the pcDNAneo/MKP-1 construct, the pcDNAneo/MKP-2 construct, or an empty vector. CCL39 cells were seeded at a density of 0.8 × 106 cells/dish (60-cm plate) (day 0) and transfected the following day (day 1) by the classical calcium phosphate coprecipitation technique with 2 μg of the relevant HA or Flag epitope-tagged kinase construct associated either with 25 μg of empty vector or with 25 μg of phosphatase-expressing vector. The cells were then serum-starved overnight (day 2), and on day 3, cells were stimulated by serum or anisomycin for 30 min. Kinase assays were performed as described below. For HA-p44MAPK and HA-p38MAPK, immunoprecipitation was performed with monoclonal anti-HA antibodies. For Flag-p46JNK, immunoprecipitation was performed with monoclonal anti-Flag antibodies. In experiments to determine the effect of MKP-1 and MKP-2 on CCL39 cell growth, CCL39 cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well (six-well plate) and transfected with plasmid encoding the Na+/H+ antiporter NHE-3 (2 μg) either with pcDNAneo alone or with pcDNAneo encoding MKP-1 or MKP-2 (20 μg). Cells were selected by the established proton-killing technique (25Pagès G. Lenormand P. L'Allemain G. Chambard J.C. Meloche S. Pouysségur J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8319-8323Google Scholar) performed over a 2-week period, after which colonies were stained with Giemsa blue (10% in PBS) and counted. CCL39 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates and, when confluent, serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were then stimulated with the appropriate agonist and, following a suitable time period, washed twice with cold PBS and lysed with Bioprobe RNA preparation (acid phenol and guadininium chloride). RNA was prepared by phenol/chloroform extraction and sodium acetate precipitation. Following RNA separation (30 μg of total RNA) on formaldehyde-agarose gels, RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose and probed by the technique of Church and Gilbert (44Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Google Scholar). The MKP-1 probe was obtained following purification from a StuI digestion (780 base pairs) of pcDNAneo/CL100. The MKP-2 probe was purified as a StuI/SacII digest (1055 base pairs) of pcDNAneo/hVH-2. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM EDTA, 40 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 200 μM sodium orthovanadate, 10-4M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μM pepstatin A, and 1% Triton X-100) for 15 min at 40C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min at 40C. Proteins from cell lysates (100 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C Extra membranes (Amersham Corp.) in 25 mM Tris-HCl and 0.19 M glycine. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 137 mM NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. The blots were then incubated with antiserum Alb-1 (1:300) in blocking solution for 2 h at room temperature. After washing in Tris-buffered saline and 0.1% Triton X-100, blots were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000) in blocking solution for 1 h and revealed with ECL. Where indicated, the activity status of p42/p44MAPK was determined by a mobility shift assay in which, following cell lysis, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide, 0.0625% bisacrylamide) and Western blotting was performed with antiserum E1B, which preferentially recognizes p42MAPK. CCL39 cells or their derivatives were seeded in 12-well plates and rendered quiescent at confluence by serum starvation for 24 h. Cells were stimulated in DMEM with 10% serum (CCL39) or in phenol red-free DMEM with either estradiol (1 μM) or serum (5%) (δRaf-1::ER) at 370C for the times indicated, prior to being washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with Triton X-100 lysis buffer as described for Western blot analysis. Proteins from lysates (200 μg) were incubated with specific anti-p44MAPK antibodies preadsorbed to protein A-Sepharose-coated beads for 2 h at 40C. Immune complexes were washed three times with Triton X-100 lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 10 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate). p42/p44MAPK activity was assayed by resuspending the final pellet in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 50 μM [γ-32P]ATP (5000 cpm/pmol) and 0.25 mg/ml myelin basic protein. The reaction was incubated for 10 min at 300C and stopped by addition of Laemmli sample buffer (45Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Cells were deprived of serum for 18 h in DMEM and stimulated with FCS (10%), IL-1β (10 ng/ml), sorbitol (300 mM), or sodium arsenite (200 μM). Cells were washed and lysed with the same protocol as that described for p42/p44MAPK. Cleared lysates (500 μg of protein) were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose coupled with 6 μg of GST-Jun-(1-79) for 3 h. Complexes were washed three times with 150 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 1% Nonidet P-40; once with PBS and 0.5 M LiCl; and twice with kinase buffer prior to the kinase reaction. Following immunoprecipitation of p38MAPK from cell lysates (400 μg of protein), immune complexes were treated exactly as described for p42/p44MAPK, with myelin basic protein being substituted in the kinase assay for GST-ATF-2 (5 μg). In each case, samples were heated at 950C for 2 min and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were exposed, and the relevant bands were quantified using a Fuji phosphorimager. Protein determinations were evaluated using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. All experiments were performed at least three times. Where indicated, data shown are representative of at least two additional experiments that gave qualitatively identical results. Previous studies that have examined the expression of MKP family members have principally employed Northern blot analysis. In serum-stimulated (2 h), but not quiescent, CCL39 cells, two RNA species that migrate with the size expected of MKP-1 and MKP-2 (∼2.4 kilobase pairs) were detected using probes that were designed to specifically identify either MKP-1 or MKP-2 mRNA species, respectively (Fig. 1A). A more detailed analysis revealed that the two mRNA species that were identified with MKP-1 and MKP-2 probes were induced by serum with a time course similar to that previously noted for MKP-1 and MKP-2 (data not shown). To specifically identify MKP-1 and MKP-2 proteins, we raised rabbit polyclonal antiserum directed against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 12 C-terminal amino acids of mouse MKP-1 (3CH134 protein) (37Charles C.H. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 187-190Google Scholar). This sequence has only one amino acid change from human MKP-1 (Lys to Gln) (10Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Google Scholar) and one amino acid change in the same position in MKP-2 (Lys to His in both rat and human sequences) (15Guan K.-L. Butch E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7197-7203Google Scholar, 46Misra-Press A. Rim C.S. Yao H. Roberson M.S. Stork P.J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14587-14596Google Scholar). In contrast, the C-terminal regions of the other MKPs bear little or no primary structure similarity. Thus, we expected that our anti-MKP antisera would be capable of recognizing both MKP-1 and MKP-2, but not other MKP family members. In Western blots of HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with expression vectors encoding MKP-1 or MKP-2, but not with empty vector, two single major bands were identified by anti-MKP-1/2 antiserum Alb-1 with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 42 kDa, in close agreement with the calculated molecular mass from the primary sequence of MKP-1 and MKP-2, respectively (Fig. 1B). We next performed Western blotting on cell lysates derived from serum-deprived or serum-stimulated CCL39 cells. Following serum stimulation (3.5 h) of quiescent CCL39 cells, Alb-1 antisera recognized two major bands with the expected molecular mass of MKP-1 and MKP-2 (Fig. 1B). In addition, these two bands comigrated with MKP-1 and MKP-2 transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells. When immunoblotting was performed in the presence of the specific peptide used for rabbit immunization, but not with an unrelated peptide sequence, the two bands with apparent molecular masses of 40 and 42 kDa were no longer detectable. Additionally, serum-mediated induction of MKP-1 and MKP-2 was dose-dependent in nature (Fig. 1C). These data strongly suggest that our anti-MKP-1/2 antiserum is capable of specifically detecting the hamster homologues of MKP-1 and MKP-2 in CCL39 cells. To analyze the induction of MKP-1 and MKP-2 in CCL39 cells, we performed Western blotting on cell lysates from serum-stimulated cells (Fig. 2A). In quiescent CCL39 cells, both MKP-1 and MKP-2 are undetectable. Upon addition of serum, MKP-1 and MKP-2 are induced, with MKP-1 present as early as 1 h after addition of serum. Comparison of a range of experiments shows that MKP-1 is often detectable as early as 30 min after addition of serum (data not shown). In contrast, MKP-2 is induced later, with detectable protein present at 2-3 h after serum addition. Each phosphatase is present for at least 14 h after serum addition. After 10-12 h of serum addition, the CCL39 cell populations had started to enter S phase, correlating with the expression of cyclin D1. Thus, MKP-1 and MKP-2 are induced and present during G0-G1 transition and S phase entry in CCL39 cells. As we have previously reported (38McKenzie F.R. Pouysségur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13476-13483Google Scholar), serum stimulation of p44MAPK is rapid, being maximal after 5 min. p44MAPK then declines slowly, until 1-2 h following serum addition, where there is a significant loss of activity (Fig. 2B, lower panel) (47Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Google Scholar). This loss of activity correlates temporally with the induction and presence of MKP-1 protein and, to a lesser extent, with the production of MKP-2 (Fig. 2, upper panel). As most members of the MKP family are encoded by immediate-early genes, addition of protein synthesis inhibitors to quiescent CCL39 cells should block their induction. To examine the contribution of MKP-1 and MKP-2 to the inactivation of p42/p44MAPK, we examined the time course of MAP kinase activity in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (Fig. 2C). As detailed in Fig. 2B, serum-stimulated p42/p44MAPK activity is maximal at 5 min and then declines such that ∼30% of the maximal activity elicited by serum (5-min time point) is present 4 h after addition of serum. However, in the presence of cycloheximide, the long-term inactivation of p42/p44MAPK is reduced such that 54% of the maximal activity elicited by serum (5-min time point) is present 4 h after addition of serum. Additional experiments revealed that cycloheximide inhibited the serum-mediated induction of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 in a dose-dependent manner that correlated with the extent of protein synthesis inhibition (data not shown). Thus, although a considerable fraction of the p42/p44MAPK inhibitory activity is independent of cycloheximide treatment, immediate-early genes and probably MKP-1 and MKP-2 play a role in setting the level of p42/p44MAPK activity in CCL39 cells. To explore the substrate specificity of two MKP family members, MKP-1 and MKP-2 expressed by CCL39 cells, we performed cotransfection assays with each phosphatase together with epitope-tagged p44MAPK, p38MAPK, or p46JNK (Fig. 3A). In response to serum, HA-p44MAPK may be activated and can phosphorylate its substrate, myelin basic protein. However, following cotransfection with either MKP-1 or MKP-2, p44MAPK is no longer activable. In a similar manner, in response to specific stress stimulus, such as anisomycin, both HA-p38MAPK and Flag-p46JNK are able to phosphorylate their respective substrates in the absence, but not in the presence, of either MKP-1 or MKP-2. Thus, the transient expression of both MKP-1 and MKP-2 attenuates the activation in vivo of each of the three kinases examined: p44MAPK, p38MAPK, and p46JNK. We have previously shown that deregulated expression of MKP-1 in CCL39 fibroblasts prevents cell cycle reentry (26Brondello J.-M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Pouysségur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904Google Scholar). As MKP-2 is also able to inhibit p42/p44MAPK in vivo (Fig. 3A), we expected that MKP-2 would also exert a strong antiproliferative effect. To examine this hypothesis, we transfected CCL39 cells with either MKP-1 or MKP-2 and determined the colony-forming ability of transfected cells (Fig. 3B). In the presence of both MKP-1 and MKP-2, colony formation and hence cell division are blocked by up to 80%, demonstrating that both MKP-1 and MKP-2 inhibit the proliferation of CCL39 cells. The transient expression studies described above (Fig. 3) show that overexpression of MKP-1 or MKP-2 can inhibit p38MAPK and p46JNK activity. However, this does not unequivocally demonstrate that endogenous MKP-1 and MKP-2 are required for inactivation of either kinase. Hence, we examined the time course of activation of p46/p54JNK in response to a range of agonists, together with the possible induction of MKP-1 or MKP-2 (Fig. 4). Activation of p46/p54JNK by osmotic shock (sorbitol), sodium arsenite (equivalent to heat shock (48Huot J. Lambert H. Lavoie J.N. Guimond A. Houle F. Landry J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 416-427Google Scholar)), or IL-1β was slow in comparison with agonist-mediated activation of p42/p44MAPK (Fig. 2), peaking at ∼30 min after addition of either sorbitol or IL-1β. In the case of sodium arsenit"

https://openalex.org/W2007417655,"Shear stress differentially regulates production of many vasoactive factors at the level of gene expression in endothelial cells that may be mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and N-terminal Jun kinase (JNK). Here we show, using bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), that shear stress differentially regulates ERK and JNK by mechanisms involving Gi2 and pertussis toxin (PTx)-insensitive G-protein-dependent pathways, respectively. Shear activated ERK with a rapid, biphasic time course (maximum by 5 min and basal by 30-min shear exposure) and force dependence (minimum and maximum at 1 and 10 dyn/cm2 shear stress, respectively). PTx treatment prevented shear-dependent activation of ERK1/2, consistent with a Gi-dependent mechanism. In contrast, JNK activity was maximally turned on by a threshold level of shear force (0.5 dyn/cm2 or higher) with a much slower and prolonged time course (requiring at least 30 min to 4 h) than that of ERK. Also, PTx had no effect on shear-dependent activation of JNK. To further define the shear-sensitive ERK and JNK pathways, vectors expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged ERK (HA-ERK) or HA-JNK were co-transfected with other vectors by using adenovirus-polylysine in BAEC. Expression of the mutant αi2(G203), antisense Gαi2 and a dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) prevented shear-dependent activation of HA-ERK, while that of αi2(G204) and antisense αi3 did not. Expression of a Gβ/γ scavenger, the carboxyl terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK-ct), and N17Ras inhibited shear-dependent activation of HA-JNK. Treatment of BAEC with genistein prevented shear-dependent activation of ERK and JNK, indicating the essential role of tyrosine kinase(s) in both ERK and JNK pathways. These results provide evidence that 1) Gi2-protein, Ras, and tyrosine kinase(s) are upstream regulators of shear-dependent activation of ERK and 2) that shear-dependent activation of JNK is regulated by mechanisms involving Gβ/γ, Ras, and tyrosine kinase(s).

Endothelial cells lining the inner vessel wall are in direct contact with flowing blood, which generates a frictional force, hemodynamic shear stress, acting on the surface of the endothelium. Hemodynamic shear stress controls vascular tone, vessel wall remodeling, interaction of blood cells with endothelium, coagulation, and fibrinolysis (1Davies P.F. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 519-560Google Scholar). The focal pattern of atherosclerotic lesions in areas of low and/or unstable shear stress further highlights the importance of shear stress in the atherogenic process (2Zarins C.K. Giddens D.P.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase family members including ERK and JNK (also known as stress-activated protein kinase), have been proposed to be important signaling components linking extracellular stimuli to cellular responses including cellular growth, differentiation, and metabolic regulation (reviewed in 17Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar and 18Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar). Mitogen-activated protein kinases can be activated by various external stimuli such as growth factors (nerve and epidermal growth factors), ligands acting on G-protein-coupled receptors (α2-adrenergic agonists and lysophosphatidic acid) and physical stresses (ultraviolet radiation and hyperosmolarity) (17Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Google Scholar). Recently, shear stress also has been shown to stimulate ERK in endothelial cells (19Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Google Scholar, 20Pearce M.J. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Whatley R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 500-504Google Scholar). Tseng et al. (19Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Google Scholar) showed that GDPβS treatment and inhibition of protein kinase C blocked shear-dependent ERK activation in fetal BAEC. In this study we examined the effect of shear stress on JNK and ERK in adult BAEC. Shear stress activated ERK and JNK with markedly different time courses and force dependence. Contrary to the previous report (19Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Google Scholar), shear-stimulated activation of ERK is regulated by mechanisms involving a PTx-sensitive αi2, Ras, and a tyrosine kinase(s). On the other hand, shear-dependent activation of JNK is not PTx-sensitive but is regulated by Gβ/γ, Ras, and pathways dependent on tyrosine kinase(s). BAEC harvested from descending thoracic aortas were maintained (370C, 5% CO2) in a growth medium (DMEM (1 g/liter glucose; Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 20% fetal calf serum (FCS; Atlanta Biologicals) without antibiotics) (21Jo H. Dull R.O. Tarbell J.M. Hollis T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1992-H1996Google Scholar). Cells used in this study were between passages 5 and 10. For shear experiments, 1 million cells/glass slide (75 × 38 mm; Fisher) were seeded in growth medium. The next day, the medium was changed to a starvation medium (phenol red-free DMEM containing 0.5% FCS and 25 mM HEPES) and incubated for 1-2 days. Where indicated, PTx (0.1 μg/ml; List Biologicals) was added 18 h prior to shear exposure. Antisense αi2 and αi3 vectors were prepared by using the EcoRI fragments of αi2 and αi3 (kind gift of Dr. R. Reed (Johns Hopkins University)) and EcoRI-cut pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described (22Liu Y.F. Jakobs K.H. Rasenick M.M. Albert P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13880-13886Google Scholar). Two Gi2α mutants containing point mutations at Gly203→ Thr (αi2(G203)) and Gly204→ Ala (αi2(G204)) inserted into pCW1 were kind gift of Dr. G. L. Johnson (University of Colorado) (23Winitz S.

Karin M. Science. 1994; 266: 1719-1723Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. S. Gutkind (National Institute of Dental Research) and Dr. A. Lin (University of Alabama at Birmingham), respectively. Endotoxin-free DNAs used in all transfection experiments were prepared by using a maxiprep kit following the manufacturer's instruction (Quiagen). For transfection studies, BAEC (2.5 × 105 cells/glass plate) were grown overnight in the growth medium and washed in Hanks' buffered salt solution just prior to transfection using the method of adenovirus conjugated to polylysine (AdpL) as described (26Deshane J. Cabrera G. Grim J. Siegal G.P. Pike J. Alvarez R.D. Curiel D.T. Gyn. Oncol. 1995; 59: 8-14Google Scholar). Briefly, a replication-defective adenovirus d11014 (kind gift of Dr. D. T. Curiel (University of Alabama at Birmingham)) was cross-linked to polylysine (Sigma) using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide-HCL), and small aliquots (1 × 1011 particles/ml) were stored at -800C (26Deshane J. Cabrera G. Grim J. Siegal G.P. Pike J. Alvarez R.D. Curiel D.T. Gyn. Oncol. 1995; 59: 8-14Google Scholar). AdpL was conjugated to DNA on the day of transfection by incubating 100 μl of HEPES-buffered saline (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.3), 50 μl of AdpL, and 2 μg of plasmid DNA per glass plate for 30 min at room temperature followed by an additional 30-min incubation at room temperature with 2 μg of polylysine in 100 μl of HEPES-buffered saline. AdpL-DNA conjugate mixed with 2 ml of DMEM containing 0.5% FCS was added to the cells. One hour later, 10 ml of DMEM containing 10% FCS was added to the cells and incubated overnight. The next day, medium was changed to fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS, incubated for 24 h, and serum-starved overnight in the starvation medium. Under identical conditions, the transfection efficiency of β-galactosidase DNA in pCMV (ATCC) ranged from 25 to 40% (data not shown) as determined by a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside staining method in 4% paraformaldehyde fixed monolayers (27Lozier J.N. Thompson A.R. Hu P. Read M. Brinkhous K.M. High K.A. Curiel D.T. Hum. Gene Ther. 1994; 5: 313-322Google Scholar). The glass slide containing a BAEC monolayer was assembled into a parallel plate shear chamber forming a flow channel (220-μm height × 2.5-cm width × 6.2-cm length) between the monolayer and fabricated polycarbonate plate as described (28Kuchan M. Jo H. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C753-C758Google Scholar). Non-pulsatile, laminar shear stress was controlled by changing the flow rate of the starvation medium delivered to the cells using the constant head flow loop or a syringe pump (KD Scientific) as described (21Jo H. Dull R.O. Tarbell J.M. Hollis T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H1992-H1996Google Scholar, 28Kuchan M. Jo H. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C753-C758Google Scholar). Following shear exposure, cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in a 0.5-ml extraction buffer (50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.33, 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM vanadate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mM benzamidine, and 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and immediately frozen at -800C until cell fractionation. Cell extracts were sonicated and centrifuged for 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were further centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min to separate crude cytosolic fractions (cytosol). For preparation of detergent-soluble lysates, shear-exposed cells were scraped in the extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, solubilized for 1 h, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The entire fractionation and solubilization procedures were performed at 40C. Protein content of each sample was measured by using a Bio-Rad DC assay kit. Soluble lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) and probed with antibodies specific to phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY), ERK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology), or phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (29Kuo W.-L. Abe M. Rhee J. Eves E.M. McCarthy S.A. Yan M. Templeton D.J. McMahon M. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1458-1470Google Scholar; New England Biolabs). Goat anti-mouse (or rabbit) IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used as secondary antibody and developed either colorimetrically using a Bio-Rad kit or by a chemiluminescent detection method as suggested by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Cytosol or soluble lysates (5 μg each) were used to phosphorylate myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma) and c-Jun (amino acids 5-89) fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-c-Jun) (30Adler V. Polotskaya A. Wagner F. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17001-17005Google Scholar). Briefly, each substrate was phosphorylated in buffer A (50 mMβ-glycerophosphate, pH 7.33, 2.5 mM EGTA, 0.1 mM vanadate, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 70 μM ATP, and 2,000 cpm/pmol [γ-32P]ATP) for 5 min at 300C. MBP phosphorylation was stopped either by spotting aliquots to P-81 filter papers followed by washing and counting (filter assay) as described (31Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar) or by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer followed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, Coomassie staining, and autoradiography. MBP phosphorylation activity was linear for at least 10 min at 300C when less than 10 μg of cytosolic protein was used (data not shown). Phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun was terminated by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Boiled samples were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining and autoradiography. Phosphorylated bands were cut and counted in a scintillation counter. For “in-gel kinase” assays, cytosols (20 μg) were resolved in a 12.5% SDS-PAGE minigel containing immobilized MBP (0.4 mg/ml) followed by phosphorylation of renatured kinases and autoradiography as described (31Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes & Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Google Scholar). For immunocomplex assays, antibodies specific for ERK1/2 (Upstate Biotechnology, catalog number 06-182), JNK1 (Pharmingen, clone G151-333), and HA (Boehringer Mannheim) were incubated with the soluble lysates (50-100 μg) for 1 h at 40C, followed by an additional 1-h incubation with Protein A-agarose (for ERK and HA antibodies) or Protein G-agarose (for JNK1 antibody) beads. The immunocomplex was washed four times in the extraction buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and twice in buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mM MgCl2, 20 mMβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 0.1 mM vanadate, and 2 mM dithiothreitol). The washed immunocomplexes were incubated in 20 μl of buffer C containing either MBP or GST-c-Jun (5 μg each) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 300C followed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and quantitation of radioactivity incorporated into each band in a scintillation counter. Immunoblot studies of BAEC lysates with a phosphotyrosine antibody showed that exposure of cells to shear stress (0, 5, 10, and 20 dyn/cm2 for 5 min each) increased tyrosine phosphorylation of 42-44-kDa bands (p44/42) in a shear intensity-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). Additional immunoblot studies showed that an ERK antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) recognized ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42) in both control and shear-stimulated BAEC (data not shown). To test directly whether shear stress stimulated ERK activity, cytosols obtained from BAEC exposed to shear stress were used in an in vitro phosphorylation assay using MBP as a substrate (filter assay; Fig. 1B). Exposure of BAEC to shear stress (5-20 dyn/cm2) for 5 min stimulated ERK activity by 2-3-fold (Fig. 1B). The minimum shear intensity required to stimulate ERK was 1 dyn/cm2. At 10 dyn/cm2 of shear intensity, MBP phosphorylation activity reached a maximal level and did not change further when shear was increased to 20 dyn/cm2. To determine the molecular weight and specificity of the shear-stimulated MBP kinase activity (Fig. 1B), an in-gel kinase assay using immobilized MBP was performed. As shown in Fig. 1C, the electrophoretic mobilities of the shear stress-dependent MBP kinase activities were 44/42 kDa, which are consistent with the molecular masses of ERK1 and ERK2, respectively. The stimulation of p44/42 phosphorylation activity by shear exposure (5 dyn/cm2 for 5 min) was higher (4-7-fold increase compared with no flow controls when determined by the densitometric measurements of autoradiograms obtained from four independent shear stress studies) than those determined by filter assays (2-3-fold; Fig. 1B). This difference is most likely due to the presence of non-ERK activity contributing to the higher basal MBP phosphorylation activity, thus lowering the relative -fold stimulation, in the filter assay. Indeed, there was another kinase activity with a molecular mass of 66 kDa (p66) phosphorylating MBP as shown in the autoradiogram obtained from the in-gel kinase assay (Fig. 1C). However, the phosphorylation activity of p66 was not changed by shear stress. The identity of ERK was further confirmed by an immunocomplex assay (Fig. 1D). ERK was immunoprecipitated by an ERK antibody (cross-reacting with both ERK1 and 2) from the lysates of control and shear-exposed BAEC. Subsequent in vitro phosphorylation of the immunocomplex using MBP as a substrate showed that shear stress stimulated ERK activity compared with control (Fig. 1D). Together, these results demonstrate that ERK was the shear-dependent kinase activity that catalyzed the phosphorylation of MBP. Shear stimulation of ERK activity was monitored as a function of shear exposure time (Fig. 2). Shear-induced (5 dyn/cm2) ERK activation was transient, reaching a maximum by 5 min and declining to control levels by 30 min of shear exposure (Fig. 2, closed circles). In parallel studies, the effect of shear stress on JNK activity was also determined using GST-c-Jun as a substrate. Although shear stimulated JNK activity in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2, open circles), the time course was markedly different from the time course for ERK activation. Shear-stimulated JNK activation required 30 min of shear exposure and increased further at 60 min. These results showed that shear activation of ERK clearly precedes that of JNK. Shear force- and time-dependent activation of JNK was further characterized (Fig. 3). When exposed for 30 min to increasing intensities of shear stress (0-20 dyn/cm2), maximum stimulation of JNK activity occurred at the lowest shear force tested (0.5 dyn/cm2) in BAEC (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast to the force-dependent activation of ERK (Fig. 1B), this result suggests that JNK is regulated by an “on or off” mechanism in response to the sustained increase in shear force. Shear-dependent activation of JNK was detectable after 30 min, reached a maximum by 4 h, and returned to basal level after 17 h of shear onset using 5 dyn/cm2 (Fig. 3, C and D). Previous studies have shown that heterotrimeric G proteins regulate both ERK and JNK pathways in other cell types. Furthermore, G-proteins have been shown to mediate many shear-dependent signaling pathways in endothelial cells by PTx-sensitive and -insensitive pathways (8Hsieh H.J. Li N.Q. Frangos J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 150: 552-558Google Scholar, 28Kuchan M. Jo H. Frangos J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C753-C758Google Scholar, 32Ohno M. Gibbons G.H. Dzau V.J. Cooke J.P. Circulation. 1993; 88: 193-197Google Scholar, 33Berthiaume F. Frangos J.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 277-279Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether Gi-proteins regulate shear-stimulated ERK and/or JNK activation using PTx. Treatment with PTx completely prevented shear-dependent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 stimulated by 2-, 5-, and 10-min shear exposure (Fig. 4, B and D, PTx groups). Essentially the same inhibitory effect of PTx on shear-dependent activation of ERK was also shown by in vitro MBP phosphorylation assay of cytosols (25 ± 7% of control, n = 6, p < 0.0001, 5 or 10 dyn/cm2 of shear stress for 5 min, data not shown). On the other hand, cholera toxin (CTx), an activator of αs, had no effect on shear-dependent activation of ERK (Fig. 4, B and D, CTx groups). PTx treatment of BAEC using the conditions employed here resulted in maximal ADP-ribosylation of Gi-proteins as evidenced by complete inhibition of in vitro PTx-catalyzed [32P]ADP-ribosylation (Fig. 4C). The rapid and transient changes in the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 were not due to changes in the amount of these enzymes as shown in Fig. 4A. Unlike ERK, PTx had no significant effect (p ≥ 0.18, n = 3 or 4) on shear-stimulated JNK1 activation at any time points examined in this study (Fig. 5). CTx treatment also had no significant effect on JNK1 activation by 30 and 60 min of shear (Fig. 5). However, at 5 min of shear, CTx stimulated JNK activation of from 89.8 ± 17% of control (n = 4, no toxin group) to 197.7 ± 50% of control (n = 3, cholera toxin group, p = 0.02) (Fig. 5, A and B). To determine the identity of the PTx substrate and the role of Ras regulating shear-sensitive ERK, BAEC were co-transfected with HA-ERK and αi constructs or N17Ras with the AdpL method. Transfection of BAEC by this method did not have any significant effect on shear-dependent activation of endogenous ERK and JNK (data not shown). Shear stress was able to stimulate the activity of HA-ERK by 3-4-fold in the co-transfected BAEC (see pcDNA3 groups, Fig. 6, A and B). Expression of αi2(G203) and antisense αi2, but not αi2(G204) and antisense αi3, prevented shear activation of HA-ERK. These results showed that the αi2(G203) produces an inhibitory phenotype and αi2(G204) is a null mutant similar to that found in previous studies (23Winitz S. Gupta S.K. Qian N.-X. Heasley L.E. Nemenoff R.A. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1889-1895Google Scholar). The antisense studies showed the specific nature of αi2 compared with the αi3 construct (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, expression of N17Ras prevented shear-sensitive ERK activation (Fig. 6B) suggesting the involvement of Ras as an upstream regulator. Previous studies have shown that JNK can be regulated by heterotrimeric G-proteins, α12, α13, αq, or Gβ/γ, in a Ras- and Rac-dependent pathway in other cell types (24Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Google Scholar, 34Prasad M.V.V.S.V. Dermott J.M. Heasley L.E. Jonhnson G.L. Dhanasekaran N. J. Biol.

Since dominant negative mutants of α12, α13, and αq have not been available, we decided to block Gβ/γ to test the role of heterotrimeric G-proteins and to use N17Ras in co-transfection studies with HA-JNK. Expression of βARK-ct inhibits shear-dependent activation of JNK by 60% compared with the HA-JNK/pcDNA3 control (Fig. 7) suggesting the involvement of heterotrimeric G-proteins as one of its upstream regulators. Furthermore, expression of N17Ras completely prevented shear-dependent activation of JNK, showing its Ras-dependence (Fig. 7). Tyrosine kinases have been shown to regulate G-protein-dependent activation of both ERK and JNK (36Wan Y. Kurosaki T. Huang X. Nature. 1996; 380: 541-544Google Scholar, 37Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Google Scholar). Therefore, we pretreated BAEC with genistein to inhibit tyrosine kinases. Genistein treatment completely blocked shear-dependent activation of both ERK and JNK, indicating tyrosine kinase involvement in both pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2065933401,"The protein kinase C (PKC) family consists of 11 isoenzymes. Following activation, each isoenzyme translocates and binds to a specific receptor for activated Ckinase(RACK) (Mochly-Rosen, D. (1995) Science 268, 247-251) that provides an anchoring site in close proximity to the isoenzyme's specific substrate. Pancreatic islet cells contain at least six PKC isoenzymes (Knutson, K. L., and Hoenig, M. (1994) Endocrinology 135, 881-886). Although PKC activation enhances insulin release, the specific function of each isoenzyme is unknown. Here we show that following stimulation with glucose, αPKC and ϵPKC translocate to the cell's periphery, while ΔPKC and ζPKC translocate to perinuclear sites. βC2-4, a peptide derived from the RACK1-binding site in the C2 domain of βPKC, inhibits translocation of αPKC and reduces insulin response to glucose. Likewise, ϵV1-2, an ϵPKC-derived peptide containing the site for its specific RACK, inhibits translocation of ϵPKC and reduces insulin response to glucose. Inhibition of islet-glucose metabolism with mannoheptulose blocks translocation of both αPKC and ϵPKC and diminishes insulin response to glucose while calcium-free buffer inhibits translocation of αPKC but not ϵPKC and lowers insulin response by 50%. These findings illustrate the unique ability of specific translocation inhibitors to elucidate the isoenzyme-specific functions of PKC in complex signal transduction pathways.

Inhibition of islet-glucose metabolism with mannoheptulose blocks translocation of both αPKC and ϵPKC and diminishes insulin response to glucose while calcium-free buffer inhibits translocation of αPKC but not ϵPKC and lowers insulin response by 50%. These findings illustrate the unique ability of specific translocation inhibitors to elucidate the isoenzyme-specific functions of PKC in complex signal transduction pathways."

The PhoQ protein is a Mg2+ and Ca2+ sensor that modulates transcription of PhoP-regulated genes in response to the extracellular concentrations of these divalent cations. We have purified a 146-amino acid polypeptide corresponding to the periplasmic (i.e. sensing) domain of the PhoQ protein. Mg2+ altered the tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence of this polypeptide whereas Ba2+, which is unable to modulate transcription of PhoP-regulated genes, did not. Mg2+ was more effective than Ca2+ at repressing transcription of PhoP-activated genes in vivo. However, maximal repression was achieved when both cations were present. An avirulent mutant harboring a single amino acid substitution in the sensing domain of PhoQ exhibited lower affinity for Ca2+ but similar affinity for Mg2+. Cumulatively, these experiments demonstrate that Mg2+ can bind to the sensing domain of PhoQ and establish the presence of distinct binding sites for Mg2+ and Ca2+ in the PhoQ protein.

https://openalex.org/W2014306050,"Apolipoprotein (apo)B mRNA editing is mediated by a multiprotein editosome complex. Apobec-1 is the catalytic component of this complex, but other proteins involved in editing have not been identified. We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify an apobec-1-interacting protein, ABBP-1. ABBP-1 contains 331 amino acid residues and is identical to a previously reported human type A/B hnRNP except for a 47-residue insertion at its C-terminal region. It contains typical RNP motifs at its N-terminal half and glycine-rich motifs in the C-terminal region. Northern blot analysis indicates that ABBP-1 mRNA is distributed in multiple human tissues. By deletion analysis, we mapped the apobec-1-binding region to the glycine-rich domain. ABBP-1 also binds to apoB mRNA transcripts around the editing site and can be UV-cross-linked to them <i>in vitro</i>. Immnodepletion of ABBP-1 from an active apoB mRNA editing tissue extract inhibits its editing activity. Down-regulation of ABBP-1 in an apobec-1-expressing HepG2 cell line by transfection with an antisense ABBP-1 cDNA construct leads to inhibition of endogenous apoB mRNA editing. We conclude that ABBP-1 is an apobec-1-interacting protein that may play an important role in apoB mRNA editing."

In vertebrate cells treated with DNA synthesis inhibitors, there is a hypermethylation of genomic DNA and a silencing of specific genes (1Nyce J. Liu L. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4353-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As an example, Nyce et al. (2Nyce J. Leonard S. Canupp D. Schulz S. Wong S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At the same time, they observed low frequency silencing of the thymidine kinase gene, which was linked to a progressive resistance to AZT. Thymidine kinase is essential for the conversion of AZT into AZT-5′-monophosphate, the active form of the inhibitor. The production of thymidine kinase-negative (TK−) epimutants was 40-fold more frequent in AZT-treated cells than in controls. The drug resistance was shown to be directly related to the methylation of the thymidine kinase gene. The TK− epimutants could be rapidly reverted to the wild type by exposing the cells to the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine. Concomitant with this reversion, the cells also regained the ability to convert AZT into its 5′-monophosphate. Other drugs such as 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, and methotrexate (all inhibitors of DNA synthesis), or inhibitors of topoisomerase II and microtubule formation, had a hypermethylating effect on the DNA from various cells grown in tissue culture (3Nyce J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5829-5836PubMed Google Scholar). However, serum deprivation or protein synthesis inhibitors like cycloheximide or RNA synthesis inhibitors such as actinomycin D had no effect on the hypermethylation of the DNA. The hypermethylation occurred predominantly in the newly synthesized DNA fraction and remained even after the removal of the drug. In the present paper we show that antibiotics such as hygromycin, kanamycin, and cefotaxime, which are commonly used as selective agents in the production of transgenic plants, also cause DNA hypermethylation in Nicotiana tabacum plantlets grown in vitro. The practical implications and the possible mechanisms of this DNA hypermethylation will be discussed. 3-azido-3-deoxythimidine S-adenosylmethionine auxin-binding protein. Seeds from N. tabacum var. SR1 were surface-sterilized with 1.4% (w/v) NaOCl for 5 min, extensively washed in sterile water, and placed on a filter paper imbibed with Linsmaier and Skoog (LS) liquid medium, without hormones (4Linsmaier E.M.

After 2 weeks of germination at 23°C in the presence of light, 10-12 plantlets were placed onto a plastic grid in a 400-cm3 plastic container (diameter 8 cm × height 9 cm; Phytotech Labor, Schwarzenburg, Switzerland) with a silicon sponge plug in the lid for air exchange. The plantlets were grown in 30 ml of liquid LS medium, without hormones, in a climatic cabinet (Termaks, Solheimsvik, Norway) at 23°C, 50% relative humidity and a 16-h photo-period. The control plants were grown in parallel with the treated plants but without antibiotics in the culture medium. The media for the treated plants were supplemented with one of kanamycin monosulfate (Sigma), hygromycin B (Calbiochem), or the sodium salt of cefotaxime (also called Claforan, Roussel) at the concentrations listed under “Results.” Cefotaxime solutions were prepared fresh before use. Kanamycin and hygromycin are usually used as selection agents for the production of transgenic plants, whereas cefotaxime is used as a bacteriostatic compound in Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. The medium was replaced every week. Wild type tobacco was used for the treatment with cefotaxime.

One volume of powder was dissolved in 2 volumes of extraction buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M EDTA, 10 mM EGTA, 1% (w/v) Sarkosyl, 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone K40, 500 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubated at 37°C overnight. The sample was extracted six times with phenol and once with chloroform and then dialyzed against several changes of water (10 liters) at 4°C for 2 days. The DNA was precipitated with isopropanol in the presence of 0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0. The DNA was digested with 20 μg/ml pancreatic ribonuclease A in 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM EGTA at room temperature for 1 h. After a phenol and a chloroform extraction, the DNA was ethanol-precipitated and subsequently redissolved in water overnight. Concentrations were measured by optical density, and the quality of the DNA was determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. The method of Bestor et al. (8Bestor T.H. Hellewell S.B. Ingram V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), combined with the two-dimensional thin layer chromatography system of Kuchino et al. (9Kuchino Y. Hanyu N. Nishimura S. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 379-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), was used to determine the methylation state of MspI (CCGG) sites in total genomic DNA. Labeled cytosine (C) and 5-methylcytosine (mC) spots were identified from the position of non-radioactive markers localized under UV light. The image and relative intensity of the radioactive spots were obtained using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The percentage of mC was calculated using the formula: % mC = (mC/(C + mC)) × 100. A modification of the methyl-accepting assay of Wu et al. (10Wu J. Issa J.-P. Herman J. Bassett Jr., D.E. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8891-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) was used to determine the methylation status of DNA isolated from control and antibiotic-treated plants. 5-10 μg of genomic DNA were digested to completion overnight with EcoRI (10 units/μg of DNA) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Biofinex). The DNA was then phenol- and chloroform-extracted, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in water. Its concentration was determined from its A260 nm value. The extent of the digestion was tested by size fractionation through a 1% agarose gel. Digested DNA (300 ng, unless specified) was incubated, in triplicate, in 25 μl containing 2 units of SssI methylase (CpG methylase, New England Biolabs), 2 μM S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine ([3H]SAM, 75-85 Ci/mmol, Amersham, TRK581) and 2 μM non-radioactive S-adenosylmethionine (SAM, New England Biolabs) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer. The reaction mixtures (25 μl) were incubated at 37°C for 2 h (unless specified). The reaction was stopped by heating at 65°C for 10 min. Each reaction product was spotted onto a separate DEAE-cellulose filter (2 × 2 cm, Schleicher & Schuell, NA 85) that had been preincubated in washing buffer (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (v/v)) for 1 h. After blotting away the excess moisture with Whatman 17 Chr paper, the pooled DEAE-cellulose filters were washed once in 200 ml for 5 min and twice in 400 ml of washing buffer for 15 min, under agitation, and then placed in a scintillation vial containing 9 ml of Ready Safe scintillation mixture (Beckman). The scintillant was quenched, in the dark, at 4°C for 1 h and then counted for 5 min. λ DNA digested with HindIII and wild type tobacco leaf DNA digested with EcoRI were used as positive controls for the test. The background was determined using a reaction without DNA, and the test was considered acceptable when the background was less than 4% of the value obtained from the control tobacco DNA. The data obtained from the scintillation counter were used to calculate the number of picomoles of methyl groups incorporated/μg of DNA. Δpmol of CH3 incorporated/μg of DNA was calculated using the formula: Δpmol of CH3/μg of DNA = (pmol of CH3/μg of control plant DNA) − (pmol of CH3/μg of treated plant DNA). Variation between experiments was corrected by normalizing the relative data to the values obtained for the SR1 tobacco DNA used as an internal control. The genome size of tobacco is 3.5 × 109 base pairs, and there is 3.9 pg of DNA/haploid genome (11Bennet M.D. Smith J.B. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. 1976; 274: 227-274PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was fractionated into high, moderate, or low repeated DNA according to the method of Britten and Kohne (12Britten R.J. Kohne D.E. Science. 1968; 161: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1802) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was cleaved with EcoRI and sheared by injection through a 26-gauge needle. Upon phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was redissolved in 0.4 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 1 mM EDTA overnight. The DNA was denatured at 100°C in a glass capillary for 5 min and hybridized at 67°C for a given Cot value (Cot = mol of nucleotides/liter × s). After incubation, the DNA solution was diluted with water to give 0.158 M sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, and then immediately absorbed onto hydroxyapatite. Double-stranded DNA was eluted with 0.158 M sodium phosphate and single-stranded DNA was eluted with 0.5 M sodium phosphate at 60°C. The eluted DNA was dialyzed in microcollodion tubes against 0.2 M NaCl at 4°C and precipitated with ethanol. 10 μg of λ DNA, digested with HindIII, was methylated to completion with 10 units of SssI methylase in the presence of unlabeled SAM under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The extent of methylation was tested by HpaII digestion (the enzyme does not cut the sequence CCGG when the internal C is methylated). Leaf genomic DNA was extracted as described in Doyle and Doyle (13Doyle J.J. Doyle J.L. Focus. 1990; 12: 13-15Google Scholar) and purified on a CsCl density gradient. 5 μg of each DNA sample were subjected to chemical modification by the reaction with sodium bisulfite according to the procedure of Frommer et al. (14Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L. Paul C.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1995; 226: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The chemically modified DNA was amplified using a strand-specific PCR and inserted into a modified pBluescript vector (pUBS1, C. M. Lazarus, Bristol University) using unique HindIII and PstI sites that had been engineered into the primers. The plasmids were cloned in Escherichia coli strain MC1022 and positive clones were identified by single colony PCR (method of Young and Blakesly; 16Young A. Blakesly R. Focus. 1991; 13: 137Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was extracted from the positive clones and purified using the QIAGEN miniprep kit (QIAGEN AG) and subjected to dideoxy-sequencing using either the Sequenase 2.0 kit (Amersham, plc) or an Applied Biosystems Inc. automated DNA sequencer. Genomic DNA was digested to completion with EcoRI, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to a Hybond N (Amersham) nylon membrane using standard procedure (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.44Google Scholar). The hybridization was carried out in phosphate buffer (18Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7264) Google Scholar), and the blots were washed at high stringency (0.2 × SSC, 1% SDS, 65°C). The probe used for detection of the class I chitinase gene was the 540-base pair EcoRI fragment of the genomic clone λCHN200 (19van Buuren M. Neuhaus J. Shinshi H. Ryals J.A. Meins F.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 232: 460-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The probe used for detection of the auxin-binding protein (ABP) gene was the first kilobase of nucleotide sequence upstream from the coding region of the T85 gene (EMBL accession no. X70902 (1993); S. Shimomura). SssI methylase (CpG methylase) is used to methylate position 5 of cytosines in CpG sites in DNA. When [3H]SAM is used as a substrate, the radioactivity incorporated into the DNA is proportional to the number of unmethylated CpG sites in the genome. The original method of Wu et al. (10Wu J. Issa J.-P. Herman J. Bassett Jr., D.E. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8891-8895Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) was modified in order to decrease the nonspecific background. After the SssI methylase reaction, the labeled DNA was bound to DEAE-cellulose filters and washed in low salt conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” The maximal recorded background, in the absence of DNA, was 0.15% of the counts/min obtained for the λ DNA and 4% of the value for SR1 tobacco DNA (data not shown). The DNA concentration dependence of the incorporation of tritiated methyl groups into λ and tobacco DNA is shown in Fig. 1 (top panel). The maximal incorporation of tritiated methyl groups (pmol/μg of DNA) was obtained between 0.1 and 0.5 μg of λ control DNA and at 1 μg of tobacco DNA. Beyond these values, the incorporation was no longer proportional to the DNA concentration; therefore, 0.3 μg of tobacco DNA were used per reaction. The time dependence for the incorporation of labeled methyl groups into tobacco DNA (Fig. 1, middle panel) indicated that the reaction was complete after 2 h of incubation. The lower panel demonstrates that the incorporation of the tritiated methyl groups into λ DNA was inversely proportional to the initial state of methylation at CpG sites. When the picomoles of methyl groups incorporated/μg of DNA were plotted against the initial methylation state of the DNA substrate, the curve was approximately linear (r = 0.999), which supports the hypothesis that the number of labeled methyl groups incorporated into the DNA substrate is a true reflection of its initial methylation state. To confirm the reliability of the SssI accepting assay, the relative percentage of mC in DNA was quantified using the method of Bestor et al. (8Bestor T.H. Hellewell S.B. Ingram V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1800-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). DNA from plantlets treated with cefotaxime (500 mg/liter) and control plantlets (cefotaxime, 0 mg/liter) was analyzed at the MspI (CCGG) sites, and Fig. 2A shows a PhosphorImager picture of the labeled nucleotides separated by TLC. It is clear that, in the cefotaxime-treated plantlets, the proportion of mC is larger than in the control plantlets, and quantification of this difference using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 2B) confirmed the extent of the cefotaxime-induced hypermethylation. The same results were obtained when the same DNA was analyzed by the SssI methylase accepting assay, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 3. The SssI accepting assay can therefore be used to analyze the methylation status of tobacco DNA.Fig. 2A, two-dimensional thin layer chromatography analysis of the methylation of the internal cytosine at CCGG (MspI) sites from total genomic DNA from N. tabacum treated or not treated with cefotaxime.

The relative DNA hypermethylation was calculated from the results obtained from the SssI accepting assay. The bar diagrams represent the difference between the picomoles of labeled CH3 incorporated into DNA from the control plantlets (0 mg/liter) and the antibiotic-treated plantlets. The left, middle, and right panels show the hypermethylation induced by cefotaxime, kanamycin, and hygromycin, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Plantlets exposed in culture to antibiotics such as cefotaxime, kanamycin, and hygromycin showed a dose-dependent increase in the mC content of their DNA (Fig. 3). The plantlets were treated for 1 month with cefotaxime at either 250 or 500 mg/liter, kanamycin at either 100 or 400 mg/liter, or hygromycin at 20 mg/liter. All three drugs gave varying degrees of DNA hypermethylation. The strongest hypermethylation of DNA was observed with cefotaxime at 500 mg/liter, where an increase of 3 × 107 methylated CpG/haploid genome was observed. As seen in Fig. 4, DNA hypermethylation was time-dependent. An exposure of the plantlets to 20 mg/liter hygromycin for 15 days resulted in a DNA hypermethylation of 2.7 ± 0.7 Δpmol of CH3/haploid genome, and after 30 days of treatment the hypermethylation was 10.6 ± 1.3 Δpmol of CH3/haploid genome. To test whether the DNA methylation was reversible upon the removal of the antibiotics, tobacco plantlets were first cultivated for 5 weeks on media containing cefotaxime at 500 mg/liter and subsequently cultivated for 2 weeks without antibiotics in the media (Fig. 5). The organs produced during the period of antibiotic treatment were scored and tested separately from the ones produced after the period of antibiotic treatment. The results (Fig. 5) showed that the level of hypermethylation induced by the antibiotics during 5 weeks of treatment (15.6 ± 2.4 Δpmol of CH3/μg of DNA) remained unchanged during the 2 weeks after removal of the drug. However, the organs produced after the removal of the antibiotic show a reduced DNA hypermethylation (2.9 ± 0.2 Δpmol of CH3/μg of DNA), indicating that for the newly synthesized organs there is, in absence of the drug, significantly less DNA hypermethylation. The same trend was also observed in plantlets cultivated in the presence of the antibiotics cefotaxime (500 mg/liter) and hygromycin (40 mg/liter) for 1 month, then transferred into soil and grown until seeds were produced. The seeds were germinated without exposure to drugs. The incorporation of tritiated methyl groups in the mother plant DNA after the culture period was 0.15 ± 0.03 pmol of CH3/μg of DNA whereas the progeny gave a value of 2.9 ± 0.4 pmol of CH3/μg of DNA, a value comparable with that of the wild type plantlets. DNA hypermethylation of cefotaxime-treated tobacco plantlets was also tested in DNA fractionated by their Cot values. Table I shows the results of the SssI accepting assay on highly, moderately or lowly repeated DNA fractions. The results indicate that hypermethylation affected all three DNA fractions. However, highly repeated DNA fractions showed more methylation than the average and low repeated DNA fractions showed less.Table IDNA hypermethylation on fractionated DNA (Cot) from cefotaxime-treated tobacco plantletsFractionCottotal DNARelative DNA hypermethylationRelative DNA hypermethylationDistribution of hypermethylationRelative methylation preference% (a)Δ pmol CH3/μg DNAΔ fmol CH3 × 10−3/haploid genome% of CH3/fraction (b)(b)/(a)Total DNA1003.23 ± 0.1512.60 ± 0.61001Highly repeated0.05186.71 ± 0.2526.16 ± 1.0291.6Moderately repeated10224.88 ± 0.6019.05 ± 2.3261.1Single-copy or low repeated1000603.13 ± 0.3412.21 ± 1.3450.75 Open table in a new tab Sodium bisulfite reacts readily with unmethylated, but not methylated, cytosines causing the deamination of cytosine to uracil under acidic conditions. When the chemically modified DNA is cloned and sequenced any methylated cytosine will be observed in the “C” track, whereas an unmethylated cytosine will be read as a “T.” The methylation pattern of a 120-base pair region of the tobacco auxin-binding protein gene T85 (EMBL accession no. X70902 (1993)) was determined for DNA extracted from plantlets grown on liquid LS media, without hormones, as controls or in the presence of 500 mg/liter cefotaxime. Four clones from each DNA sample were analyzed by DNA sequencing. Fig. 6 shows that the DNA from untreated plantlets (grown in the absence of cefotaxime) was unmethylated in the promoter region, whereas, for plantlets grown in the presence of cefotaxime, substantial CpG methylation was observed. Three out of four clones showed a strong bias toward de novo methylation of CpG sites with 100%, 40%, and 60% of all CpG sites being methylated. Aside from CpG sites, CpGpG and CpTpG sites were also methylated. The clone 500a appeared to be completely methylated, even at non-symmetrical sites. These results were not due to an artifact of the bisulfite reaction, since other DNA samples treated at the same time and with the same batch of sodium bisulfite showed no DNA methylation (see Fig. 6, 0a, lane T). The complete conversion of the control DNA templates also demonstrated that there was no sequence-specific protection of the DNA that might prevent its complete reaction with the bisulfite. A 191-base pair region of the promoter for the class I chitinase gene was also analyzed for sequence-specific methylation by genomic sequencing of the bisulfite reaction products. Fifteen clones from each of soil-grown tobacco plants, plants grown in culture in the absence of cefotaxime (cef-0), and plants grown in culture in the presence of 500 mg/liter cefotaxime (cef-500) were sequenced (Table II). As with the ABP gene, T85, none of the clones from soil-grown plants showed any methylation in this region. Two of the clones from cef-0 plants showed a small amount of de novo methylation, and eight of the cef-500 clones showed the same (Table II). This de novo methylation did not appear to be directed to specific sites but instead showed considerable heterogeneity from clone to clone; however, an analysis of the context of this methylation (once site availability and the number of clones had been taken into account) showed that in both the ABP and class I chitinase genes the preferred target sites were CpG > CpNpG > CpX and the approximate preferences for each site were, respectively, 1:0.5:0.25 (Table III). This indicates that while CpG is the preferred target for the methylation other sites are also affected. The fact that we were able to detect drug-induced methylation changes in two short regions of two independent sequences further serves to confirm the scale of this phenomenon.Table IICefotaxime-induced cytosine methylation of the tobacco class I chitinase promoterTable IICefotaxime-induced cytosine methylation of the tobacco class I chitinase promoterTable IIISequence context of the cefotaxime-induced de novo methylationABPChitinaseCpXs methylated/no. of clones (A)5.50.27CpGs methylated/no. of clones (B)3.750.33CNGs methylated/no. of clones (C)0.50.4No. of CpXs/no. of Cs (D)0.790.66No. of CpGs/no. of Cs (E)0.180.09No. of CNGs/no. of Cs (F)0.040.25CpX preference (A/D = G)7.00.41CpG preference (B/E = H)20.83.52CNG preference (C/F = I)14.01.6Relative CpX preference (G/H)0.340.12Relative CpG preference (H/H)1.001.00Relative CNG preference (I/H)0.670.45 Open table in a new tab To test the possibility that a drug-induced gene amplification could be the cause of DNA hypermethylation, the copy number of the class I chitinase gene and the ABP gene, T85, were compared between plants cultivated in the presence or absence of cefotaxime. Southern blot analysis using the respective probes showed no increase in the copy number of either the class I chitinase or the ABP genes between the controls and the treated plants. We conclude that the DNA hypermethylation observed here was not due to gene amplification. Somaclonal variations in plant DNA methylation patterns have been reported to arise frequently during tissue culture. Methylation changes are associated with differentiation processes such as embryogenesis (21Lo Schiavo F. Pitto L. Guiliano G. Torti G. Nutti-Ronchi V. Marazziti D. Vergera R. Orselli S. Terzi M. Theor. Appl. Genet. 1989; 77: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and plant regeneration, leading to epigenetic variation of certain traits as well as gene silencing (for reviews, see 22Phillips R.L. Kaeppler S.M. Olhoft P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5222-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar and 23Finnegan E.J. McElroy D. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 883-888Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). For example, Ingelbrecht et al. (24Ingelbrecht I. Van Houdt H. Van Montagu M. Depicker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10502-10506Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) have described a case of posttranscriptional silencing of reporter transgenes in primary transformants of tobacco. This silencing was correlated with DNA methylation, and this de novo methylation was not restricted to cytosines located in the CG or CNG context. The level of methylation is also known to be affected by exogenous chemicals such as AZT (which induces hypermethylation) and 5-azacytidine (which induces hypomethylation). The results presented in this paper show that the antibiotics hygromycin, kanamycin, and cefotaxime all induce a genome-wide hypermethylation in cultured tobacco plants. As all of these antibiotics are routinely used in the production of transgenic plants, this observation may be of critical importance in the study of certain types of gene silencing that plague this area of research (24Ingelbrecht I. Van Houdt H. Van Montagu M. Depicker A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10502-10506Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 25Matzke M.A. Matzke A.J.M. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In addition to any regulatory consequences that methylation may have on gene expression, it will also increase the risk of point mutations created by the spontaneous deamination of methyl cytosine into thymine, although this need not necessarily give rise to a specific phenotype. The mechanism of antibiotic-induced methylation of DNA remains unclear; however, at least in the case of hygromycin and kanamycin (which both affect protein synthesis), it is possible that the drugs could act by slowing down the cell cycle to prolong the S phase. This would provide a wider window for the DNA methyltransferase to act on the DNA, but this cannot be the entire explanation, as cefotaxime (a penicillin derivative) does not have any known cellular target. Another possibility is that there could be an overall increase in methyltransferase activity. Mammalian DNA methyltransferase can be induced into efficient de novo methylation directly by proteolytic cleavage. Induction could also occur as a consequence of an increase in specific activators stimulating the enzyme or a decrease in the number of negative regulatory factors bound to non-methylated CpG sequences. The simplest model, however, would be that the DNA substrate becomes more susceptible to methylation by changes in its structure such as the appearance of heteroduplexes, single-stranded loops, or mismatches, all of which are known to stimulate methyltransferase activity (for reviews, see 26Smith S.S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 65-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and 27Bestor T.H. Tycko B. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The occurrence of single-stranded loops could account for the non-symmetrical methylation by creating hairpin structures bringing together C and G residues to form symmetrical CpG or CpNpG sites. The observation that drug-induced hypermethylation only occurs during the application of the antibiotics is significant as it leads to the construction of a hypothesis which is currently being tested. Changes in methylation are usually accompanied by cell division, so the most likely targets for the antibiotics are the meristematic cells, which are constantly dividing and differentiating to produce new plant material. If the antibiotics interfere in the pathway toward differentiation in the daughter cells of the meristems, then they may become hypermethylated, whereas the meristem itself would remain unaffected and would not change its methylation status. Thus, once the antibiotics have been removed, any pre-existing cells will continue to be hypermethylated, but new growth will rapidly revert to the wild type pattern of methylation. This hypothesis is supported by the experiment illustrated in Fig. 5. The property of meristem integrity has long been known and is in fact often used as a means of rescuing plants from systemic viral (or other pathogen) infections. Several authors have suggested that DNA methylation could be involved in defense reactions, both in plants and animals, and, moreover, de novo methylation has been shown to be associated with retrovirus (28Stewart C.L. Stuhlmann H. Jaehner D. Jeanish R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4098-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and viroid (29Wassenegger M. Heimes S. Riedel L. Sänger H.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 567-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar) inactivation. As antibiotics are produced by fungi, which are pathogens of plants, a high dose of antibiotics could mimic a pathogen attack and induce the plant into a defensive posture. If this were the mechanism, then the proposed lack of meristem methylation would provide a way for the plant to “stand down” after surviving a fungal attack. However, if a methylation change did occur in the meristems, then it would be expected to be maintained irrespective of the presence or absence of antibiotics. Meyer et al. (20Meyer P. Heidmann I. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) have observed, in transgenic petunia, the selective methylation of foreign DNA integrated into an otherwise hypomethylated region of the genome. This methylation was probably a defense response of the plant to invading DNA, possibly by de novo methylation of the single-stranded T-DNA loop during integration, but the application of high concentrations of antibiotics at this stage may serve to exacerbate the situation, resulting in even more methylation and thus gene silencing. Antibiotic-induced DNA hypermethylation should be considered as a drawback of classical selection procedures for plant tissue culture, and attempts should be made to reduce the use of such compounds in order to reduce their undesirable effects on plant development and gene expression. We suggest that perhaps the most critical stage for the long term phenotype of the plant may be early in its development, and the use of large concentrations of cefotaxime in particular immediately after co-cultivation of leaf pieces with Agrobacteria may be inadvisable."

Additional studies demonstrate that the SLP-76 SH2 domain also binds a protein kinase from stimulated RBL-2H3 cell lysates. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of SLP-76 requires Syk activity but is not dependent on Ca+2 mobilization. These data, together with our previous work documenting its role in T-cell activation, suggest that SLP-76 and the proteins with which it associates may play a fundamental role in coupling signaling events in multiple cell types in the immune system.

https://openalex.org/W2034973272,"We have recently found that stable R-loop formation occurs in vivo and in vitro when a portion of the Escherichia coli rrnB operon is transcribed preferentially in its physiological orientation. Our results also suggested that the formation of such structures was more frequent in topA mutants and was sensitive to the template DNA supercoiling level. In the present report we investigated in greater detail the involvement of DNA topoisomerases in this process. By using an in vitro transcription system with phage RNA polymerases, we found that hypernegative supercoiling of plasmid DNAs in the presence of DNA gyrase is totally abolished by RNase H, suggesting that extensive R-looping occurs during transcription in the presence of DNA gyrase.

DNA topoisomerases are enzymes involved in the regulation of DNA conformation (for a review see 1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). Since the topology of DNA affects most of its functions, DNA topoisomerases are considered key elements in the regulation of genomic activities. In bacteria, they are involved in the control of chromosomal DNA supercoiling (2Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). This task is apparently performed by two DNA topoisomerases with opposite enzymatic activities: DNA topoisomerase I (originally known as ω protein), encoded by the topA gene that specifically relaxes negative supercoiling (3Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 55: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), and DNA gyrase encoded by the gyrA and gyrB genes that introduces negative supercoiling into the DNA (4Gellert M.

In bacteria, changes in plasmid DNA supercoiling in topoisomerase mutants have been linked to transcription elongation in some cases (14Pruss G.J. Drlica K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8952-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Hence, the production of positively supercoiled plasmid DNA upon DNA gyrase inactivation (16Lockshon D. Morris D.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 2999-3016Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) is linked to transcription elongation (15Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In the absence of the topA gene function, the production of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA (17Pruss G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) has also been linked to transcription elongation (14Pruss G.J. Drlica K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8952-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, only transcription of genes encoding for membrane-bound proteins are shown to generate such hypernegative supercoiling (18Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). One exception is the galK gene which, upon transcription in cis, can be responsible for hypernegative supercoiling of plasmid DNAs (19Franco R.J. Drlica K. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6573-6579Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In order to explain the link between DNA topoisomerases and transcription elongation in both eucaryotes and procaryotes, a twin-domain model for transcription has been proposed (20Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). According to this model, positive and negative supercoiling domains are generated, respectively, ahead and behind the moving RNA polymerase. This model has been supported by much experimental evidence (for a review see 21Drolet M. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Predicted by this model is the fact that co-transcription and translation with simultaneous attachment of the nascent peptide to the membrane will generate the maximum number of supercoils, because in this situation the rotation of the elongation complex is completely blocked. This model also explains why positive supercoiling will be generated during transcription in the absence of DNA gyrase, since, in this situation, only the negative supercoils will be removed by DNA topoisomerase I. Hypernegative supercoiling in the absence of DNA topoisomerase I is equally explained by the selective removal of positive supercoils by DNA gyrase. However, recent in vitro experiments have shown that the production of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA during transcription in the presence of DNA gyrase was linked to R-loop formation (22Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, the relaxing activity of DNA topoisomerase I was shown to be strongly activated by transcription and to inhibit hypernegative supercoiling, and hence R-looping. It was thus suggested that the regulation of R-loop formation during transcription was an important role for DNA topoisomerases in Escherichia coli. In this model, DNA topoisomerase I and RNase H, an enzyme specifically degrading the RNA portion of an R-loop, are negative regulators of R-loop formation, while DNA gyrase, with its negative supercoiling activity, favors the formation of such structures. This model is also supported by the fact that the growth defect of topA null mutants is partially complemented by overproducing RNase HI and that a defect in DNA gyrase activity helps the growth of rnhA (encoding for RNase HI) mutants (23Drolet M. Phoenix P. Menzel R. Massé E. Liu L.F. Crouch R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3526-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the R-loop structure possesses all the elements to be an excellent substrate for DNA topoisomerase I activity, namely a single-stranded DNA region in proximity of a double-stranded one (24Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In order to better study the putative roles of DNA topoisomerases in the regulation of R-loop formation, it was necessary to isolate DNA sequences that are subject to forming such structures upon transcription. We recently showed that stable R-loop formation occurs during transcription of a portion of the rrnB operon, preferentially in its physiological orientation. 1é. Massé, P. Phoenix, and M. Drolet, submitted for publication. This study also showed that DNA supercoiling was an important factor for R-loop formation. In the present report, we investigated in greater detail the involvement of DNA topoisomerases and DNA supercoiling in R-loop formation during transcription of this rrnB DNA fragment. pJP459 and pJP461 have been described.1 Briefly, they are pBluescript II KS derivatives in which the 567-base pair HindIII fragment from the rrnB operon of E. coli was inserted in the reverse (pJP459) or the physiological (pJP461) orientation relative to the vector map numbering. For in vitro transcription experiments, these plasmids were purified by using the Qiagen plasmid kit (Qiagen). T3 and T7 RNA polymerases were from Stratagene. E. coli DNA gyrase A and B subunits and E. coli DNA topoisomerase I were generously provided by James C. Wang (Harvard University) and Leroy F. Liu (University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School). DNA gyrase was reconstituted by preincubating at 37°C for 30 min. GyrA (1.42 μg) and GyrB (1.5 μg) subunits together in a total volume of 30 μl of a solution containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 70 mM KCl, and 50% glycerol. 1 μl of this mixture (i.e. about 50 ng each of GyrA and GyrB) was used in a typical in vitro transcription reaction (see below). E. coli RNase HI was kindly provided by R. J. Crouch (National Institutes of Health). RNase A, from Boehringer Mannheim, was prepared as described (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Proteinase K was from Boehringer Mannheim. Typical in vitro transcription reactions were performed essentially as described previously (22Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, they were performed in a volume of 25 μl of a solution containing 35 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 25 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 0.4 mM each of CTP, GTP, and UTP, 1.2 mM ATP, 0.5 μg of purified pJP459 or pJP461 DNA, 10 units of T3 or T7 RNA polymerase, and when specified, RNase A and RNase H were added at the indicated concentrations. Unless otherwise indicated, the reactions were incubated at 37°C for 3 min before the addition of E. coli DNA gyrase (about 50 ng of each subunit) and then incubated for an additional 10 min at the same temperature. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 25 μl of a solution containing 50 mM EDTA, 1% SDS, and 12.5 μg of proteinase K. After an incubation of 30 min at 37°C, the samples were extracted once with phenol and once with chloroform and then precipitated with ethanol. They were resuspended in 20 μl of a reaction buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, 1 μg of RNase A, and 20 ng of RNase H. After an incubation of 45 min at 37°C, the samples were phenol-extracted and then analyzed by one-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (0.8%) with chloroquine (15 μM) in 0.5 × TBE (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After electrophoresis they were either soaked in 1 mM MgCl2 for 1 h before being stained with ethidium bromide or they were dried and prepared for in situ hybridization as described (15Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (22Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 0.5 × TBE was used instead of TPE during electrophoresis. The chloroquine concentrations used were 15 and 60 μM, respectively, in the first and second dimension. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and prepared for in situ hybridization as described (15Wu H.Y. Shyy S.H. Wang J.C. Liu L.F. Cell. 1988; 53: 433-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). R-loop formation was recently shown to occur preferentially when the 567-base pair HindIII fragment from the rrnB operon of E. coli was transcribed in its physiological orientation in a topA mutant and in an in vitro system using phage RNA polymerases.1 This conclusion is based on the fact that RNase H-sensitive gel retardation of plasmid DNAs during electrophoresis was observed when this fragment was preferentially transcribed in its original orientation, either in vitro or in vivo. R-loop formation during transcription of this DNA fragment in the topA mutant was also shown to be sensitive to the DNA supercoiling level. Previous in vitro studies have shown that hypernegative supercoiling of pBR322 DNA in the presence of DNA gyrase and during transcription by E. coli RNA polymerase was linked to R-loop formation (22Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We thus considered the possibility that the hypernegative supercoiling assay could be used to demonstrate the orientation preference in the process of R-loop formation during transcription of the rrnB HindIII fragment (see below). In addition, in order to study the role of DNA gyrase in R-loop formation during transcription of the HindIII fragment from the rrnB operon, it was important to find experimental conditions allowing both active transcription by phage RNA polymerases and DNA supercoiling by DNA gyrase. In the beginning we used the pJP459 plasmid, a pBluescript II KS derivative in which the rrnB HindIII fragment is oriented in such a way that it is transcribed in its physiological orientation by the T3 RNA polymerase. As can be seen in Fig. 1, transcription by T3 RNA polymerase allows the production of hypernegatively supercoiled pJP459 DNA in the presence of DNA gyrase (complete). The omission of one nucleotide completely abolished hypernegative supercoiling (3 NTPs), showing that active transcription is required. Hypernegative supercoiling of pJP459 DNA seems to be totally dependent on R-loop formation, since it is completely abolished by the presence of RNase H during transcription (complete + RNase H). The RNase H effect is better seen in the bottom panel, where the hypernegatively supercoiled topoisomers revealed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (complete) are totally absent when RNase H is added during transcription (RNase H). An aliquot of the DNA sample loaded on the two-dimensional gel (complete) was shown to be completely relaxed by E. coli DNA topoisomerase I demonstrating that it is indeed hypernegatively supercoiled DNA (data not shown). In a separate experiment, by using relaxed pJP459 DNA, we have shown that the DNA supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase is not affected at all by the presence of RNase H under the transcription conditions used (data not shown). In addition, RNase H had no inhibitory effect on transcription, and indeed, as previously demonstrated,1 the production of RNA increased in the presence of RNase H, suggesting that an R-loop can act as a roadblock for a transcription complex (data not shown). Interestingly, the presence of RNase A at high concentration had no effect on the formation of hypernegatively supercoiled pJP459 DNA (complete + RNase A). We considered the possibility that the hypernegative supercoiling assay might have some advantages over the gel shift assay to demonstrate R-loop formation. Indeed, in the hypernegative supercoiling assay, an RNase H-dependent linking number change that occurs before the arrest of transcription is taken as evidence for R-loop formation, and it is thus independent of the stability of the R-loop during electrophoresis. In order to demonstrate that hypernegative supercoiling occurs preferentially when the rrnB HindIII fragment is transcribed in its physiological orientation, time course experiments were performed. In the beginning, on account of the observation that the production of hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA was not as fast when T7 RNA polymerase was used instead of T3 RNA polymerase, we decided to use the T7 RNA polymerase to facilitate the analysis of the results. pJP459 and pJP461 DNAs were thus transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of DNA gyrase, and aliquots were periodically taken and mixed with a stop solution as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In pJP459, T7 RNA polymerase transcribes the rrnB HindIII fragment in its reverse orientation, whereas in pJP461 this DNA fragment is transcribed in its physiological orientation by the T7 RNA polymerase. As can be seen in Fig. 2A, the appearance of hypernegatively supercoiled topoisomers increased with time and was relatively rapid, since within 2 min a significant amount of topoisomers were already hypernegatively supercoiled. No differences were observed between pJP459 and pJP461 DNAs, suggesting that hypernegative supercoiling, and hence R-looping, was rather nonspecific under these conditions. However, when RNase A at 20 μg/ml was added during the time course experiment (Fig. 2B), almost no hypernegatively supercoiled topoisomers were produced when pJP459 was transcribed (left part), whereas such topoisomers were clearly produced when the rrnB HindIII fragment was transcribed in its physiological orientation (pJP461; right part). These results suggest that the process of R-loop formation during transcription of the rrnB HindIII fragment in its physiological orientation is very resistant to RNase A at a high concentration and therefore that the R-loops are more stable and/or that they are generated at a higher frequency. We consider unlikely the possibility that the RNase A effect at this high concentration is linked to degradation of nascent RNAs that can theoretically participate in R-loop formation in a 3′ to 5′ direction, because if this were the case, then R-loop formation and hence hypernegative supercoiling should always be sensitive to RNase A at this concentration, irrespective of the transcribed DNA template. Therefore, we believe that R-loop formation during transcription by phage RNA polymerases occurs in a 5′ to 3′ direction and that the RNA in the hybrid is elongated by RNA polymerase without being displaced from the template strand. This is also suggested from experiments described below. In order to investigate in greater detail the role of DNA gyrase in R-loop formation, we designed a two-stage reaction in which DNA gyrase is added after transcription is arrested. A similar approach has been used to demonstrate R-loop formation due to transcription of pBR322 DNA in the presence of DNA gyrase (22Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pJP459 and pJP461 DNAs were thus transcribed with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase, and after the arrest of transcription by heating, DNA gyrase was added. The results of such experiments are presented in Fig. 3. Under the chloroquine concentration used during electrophoresis (7.5 μg/ml; Fig. 3A), an irregular distribution of topoisomers (e.g. second lane) reflects a population where more negatively supercoiled topoisomers are present as compared with a regular distribution of topoisomers (e.g. first lane), where less negatively supercoiled topoisomers are present. This was confirmed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3, B and C). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the absence of any added RNases, similar topoisomers distributions are observed, irrespective of the polymerase and the plasmid DNA used. These distributions are highly heterogeneous, with some topoisomers being highly negatively supercoiled. This is better seen in Fig. 3B (pJP459, no RNases) and Fig. 3C (pJP461, no RNases), where some DNA samples were loaded on a two-dimensional agarose gel. The fact that RNase H completely eliminated this heterogeneity and the formation of highly negatively supercoiled topoisomers shows that this is due to R-loop formation (Fig. 3, A-C, +RNase H). Interestingly, when RNase A was added, more negatively supercoiled topoisomers were produced with T3 RNA polymerase than with T7 RNA polymerase in the case of pJP459 (Fig. 3, A and B, +RNase A), whereas the reverse situation was observed for pJP461 (Fig. 3, A and C, +RNase A). This is expected if transcription of the rrnB HindIII fragment in its physiological orientation produces R-loops that are more stable. We consider it unlikely that this is an indication that R-loop formation is more frequent in the physiological orientation, since highly negatively supercoiled topoisomers should be produced in larger amounts in this orientation, which was clearly not the case (Fig. 3, B and C, no RNases). The fact that the formation of highly negatively supercoiled DNAs was completely abolished by RNase H and only partially by RNase A may suggest that nascent RNAs are involved in R-loop formation and therefore that DNA gyrase can participate in R-loop elongation when transcription is arrested, as suggested previously (22Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this is not true if, as stated above, the RNase A effect reflects the stability of the R-loop and not the presence of free RNAs. Our results also suggest that longer R-loops are being produced when DNA gyrase is present during active transcription, since hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs are then produced, whereas when DNA gyrase is added after the arrest of transcription, only highly negatively supercoiled DNAs are produced (compare the two-dimensional gel of Fig. 1 (left panel) with the two-dimensional gel of Fig. 3B (no RNases)). This suggests that extensive R-loop formation occurs only during active transcription in a 5′ to 3′ direction and in the presence of DNA gyrase, as previously suggested in the case of the pBR322 RNAII primer (26Parada C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15120-15129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, the role of DNA gyrase is to counteract extensive relaxation of plasmid DNAs due to R-loop elongation and therefore to allow more extensive R-loop elongation. This is because in the absence of DNA gyrase, extensive R-loop elongation could eventually be blocked by the accumulation of positive supercoils. Data presented above shows that the hypernegative supercoiling reaction in the presence of DNA gyrase was an efficient way of detecting R-loop formation during transcription. Therefore, this assay can be useful to evaluate the effects of DNA topoisomerase I on R-loop formation during active transcription. Previous in vitro studies have shown that the relaxation activity of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was strongly activated by transcription (22Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Tsao Y.P. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). This can best be explained by the twin domain model of transcription, where DNA topoisomerase I relaxes negative supercoiling generated behind the moving RNA polymerase. Therefore, it is possible that DNA topoisomerase I directly inhibits R-loop formation by relaxing the local negative supercoiling induced by transcription, if local negative supercoiling is important for R-loop formation. The stimulated relaxation activity of DNA topoisomerase I during transcription can also efficiently counteract the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase to keep global negative supercoiling of plasmid DNAs below the level required for R-loop formation. pJP459 DNA was thus transcribed in vitro by T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of various ratios of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I to E. coli DNA gyrase. As shown in Fig. 4, 40 ng of DNA topoisomerase I was sufficient to almost completely inhibit hypernegative supercoiling of pJP459 DNA. 11 ng of RNase H had the same inhibitory effect (Fig. 4). Therefore, at a roughly 1:1:1 molar ratio of DNA template, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase I or RNase H, hypernegative supercoiling was inhibited. This result suggests that under our experimental conditions, DNA topoisomerase I was as efficient as RNase H to inhibit hypernegative supercoiling and hence R-looping in the presence of a similar amount of DNA gyrase. The fact that RNase A at a high concentration did not abolish hypernegative supercoiling (see above), and hence R-looping, suggests that local DNA supercoiling generated during RNA polymerase movement is not a key factor for this reaction, at least when a DNA template with a superhelical density of about −0.05 is used. This is because, according to the twin domain model, nascent RNA should be required to create a frictional drag to inhibit RNA polymerase rotation and hence to allow the generation of negative and positive supercoils during RNA polymerase movement. In agreement with the model, RNase A at a very low concentration has been shown to inhibit transcription-induced positive supercoiling in the presence of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I (27Tsao Y.P. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Therefore, adding RNase A at high concentrations during transcription in the presence of both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase I should favor the hypernegative supercoiling reaction, if the transcription-generated negative supercoiling is important to stimulate the relaxation activity of DNA topoisomerase I. This is demonstrated in Fig. 5, where DNA topoisomerase I and DNA gyrase where mixed together during transcription of pJP459 DNA by T3 RNA polymerase in the presence or absence of RNase A at 20 μg/ml. It is evident that the addition of RNase A favored the hypernegative supercoiling reaction (compare the left panel (without RNase A) with the right panel (with RNase A)). According to these results, the transcription-induced relaxing activity of DNA topoisomerase I efficiently inhibits hypernegative supercoiling by DNA gyrase by possibly decreasing plasmid DNA supercoiling below the level required for R-loop formation. Previous studies have demonstrated that E. coli DNA topoisomerase I preferentially binds to the junctions of duplex and single-stranded regions (24Kirkegaard K. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 625-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar; for a review see 1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). This explains why this enzyme will specifically relax negatively supercoiled DNA, since negative supercoiling favors the unpairing of DNA strands. In this context, an R-loop could potentially create a hot spot for binding and relaxation by E. coli DNA topoisomerase I, since such a structure will create junctions of duplex and single-stranded DNAs. Therefore, an R-looped plasmid DNA should be a better substrate for DNA relaxation by this enzyme than a non-R-looped substrate. R-looped pJP459 DNA was thus prepared by transcription with T3 RNA polymerase. After the arrest of transcription, only one half of the DNA was treated with RNase H. It can be seen in Fig. 6 that relaxation of pJP459 DNA was clearly more efficient when the R-loop was not eliminated by prior RNase H treatment. Moreover, the topoisomers distribution was always more heterogeneous, with some topoisomers being completely relaxed, in the case of the population containing R-looped plasmid DNAs. The heterogeneity can be explained by the fact that this population contains both R-looped and non-R-looped plasmid DNAs and that the R-looped ones are almost completely relaxed before the non-R-looped substrates are touched by DNA topoisomerase I. According to linking number measurements and gel shift assays, more than 70% of the plasmid molecules were found to carry R-loops in this population (data not shown). In the present report we have investigated the role of DNA topoisomerases in R-loop formation during transcription. Our previous results have indicated that the level of negative supercoiling was an important determinant of R-loop formation in vivo and in vitro.1 This is in agreement with earlier results (28Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 87: 797-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 29Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 30Champoux J.J. McConaughy B.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It means that one key role of DNA gyrase is to maintain the negative superhelicity at a level appropriate to allow R-loop formation. In agreement with this result, R-loop formation was not detected in our two-stage reaction when a relaxed DNA template was used during transcription (data not shown). Once R-loop formation is initiated it can elongate if sufficient negative superhelicity is maintained throughout this process. In this context, on a small supercoiling domain such as the pJP459 and pJP461 DNAs used in this study, the role of DNA gyrase is predictable and was indeed observed. Therefore, DNA gyrase will maintain high negative superhelicity throughout the process of R-looping and will produce hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNAs upon R-loop removal by RNase H. However, this role of DNA gyrase in R-loop elongation might not be as important in a chromosomal DNA context if only very large supercoiling domains exist (31Sinden R.R. Pettijohn D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 224-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and if the diffusion of the supercoils is fast enough. This is because in this context, extensive R-loop elongation will not significantly affect the negative supercoiling level of the domain. However, small supercoiling domains may at least transiently exist, due, for example, to the presence of moving transcription complexes and large DNA-bound protein complexes (20Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). We have also investigated the role of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I in R-loop formation. We found that the strong transcription-induced relaxing activity of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I can inhibit R-looping, probably by modulating the global DNA supercoiling level of the DNA template. However, it is still possible that the transcription-induced negative supercoiling might be important for R-loop formation, since half of the global supercoiling is believed to be constrained in vivo by proteins binding to negatively supercoiled DNA (2Drlica K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In this context, DNA topoisomerase I will control R-loop formation by modulating the transcription-induced negative supercoiling. In addition, we found that the R-loop structure is a hot spot for relaxation by E. coli DNA topoisomerase I. Therefore, relaxation by this enzyme as soon as R-loop formation is initiated may result in the destabilization of the short R-loop. E. coli DNA topoisomerase I can thus indirectly prevent R-loop initiation and directly prevent R-loop elongation, at least in our in vitro system. In this context, it is easy to understand why this enzyme is a key element in the regulation of R-loop formation. Also, since R-loop formation can modulate both DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase I activity, it can possibly be an important element in the regulation of the global DNA supercoiling level in vivo. One can also predict that RNase H participates in this function. We also used the hypernegative supercoiling reaction to investigate the mechanism of R-loop formation. Together, the fact that hypernegative supercoiling was only produced during active transcription and was, at least in some situations, resistant to the presence of RNase A at a high concentration, suggest that the RNA in the hybrid was never free and, therefore, that R-loop formation occurred in a 5′ to 3′ direction. A similar conclusion was previously reached when RNA primer formation during pBR322 transcription in the presence of DNA gyrase was studied (26Parada C.A. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15120-15129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results do not exclude the possibility that R-loop formation also occurs from nascent RNA in a 3′ to 5′ direction during active transcription in the absence of RNase A. Indeed, previous studies have suggested that R-loop formation during pBR322 transcription with E. coli RNA polymerase occurred by this mechanism (22Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that hypernegative supercoiling during transcription in the absence of RNase A was nonspecific but was specific in the presence of RNase A suggests that some R-loops are more stable, or persistent, than others. To be biologically meaningful, the stability factor is probably the most important for an R-loop. Therefore, R-loop formation during transcription of the rrnB HindIII fragment in the physiological orientation is possibly biologically significant. Indeed, we observed that transcription of this fragment, preferentially in its physiological orientation, on a plasmid DNA partially inhibited the growth of a topA mutant if RNase H was not overproduced.1 Also, our results suggest that unstable R-loops are frequently produced during transcription and that DNA gyrase, acting very rapidly, allows their detection. Considering that the RNase A effect reflects R-loop stability, it may suggest that our gel retardation experiments, in which the DNA samples were treated with RNase A at a high concentration prior to electrophoresis, can also be explained in this context. The fact that when a hypernegatively supercoiled plasmid DNA was used as a template during transcription in vitro (data not shown) and in vivo,1 R-loop formation was still specific to the physiological orientation of the rrnB fragment, as shown by the gel retardation assay, can also be explained in the context of R-loop stability. It may suggest that increasing negative supercoiling above a certain level does not significantly enhance R-loop stability. Although the hypernegative supercoiling reaction can be a good assay to study R-loop formation in vitro, it may not be as useful to study this process in vivo. This is because so many factors can influence DNA supercoiling in vivo and because hypernegative supercoiling can possibly be generated in different ways in vivo (18Lynch A.S. Wang J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1645-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Drolet M. Wu H.-Y. Liu L.F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 29A: 135-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). One must also consider the possibility that in some situations hypernegative supercoiling occurs before R-loop formation and that the formation of such structures simply protects the hypernegatively supercoiled DNA from relaxation. In vivo, binding of histone-like proteins to DNA, for example, may also protect hypernegatively supercoiled DNA from being relaxed."

https://openalex.org/W2017216637,"DT-diaphorase (EC 1.6.99.2), also referred to as NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase, is involved in the reductive activation process of several cytotoxic antitumor quinones and nitrobenzenes. It has been observed in our and other laboratories that the rat enzyme is significantly more effective in activating these drugs than the human and mouse enzymes. These results indicate that the available cytotoxic drugs are better substrates for the rat enzyme and are not the most ideal prodrugs for activation by DT-diaphorase in human tumors. In this study, using site-directed mutagenesis to replace residues in the rat enzyme with the human sequences and residues in the human enzyme with the rat sequences, we have found that residue 104 (Tyr in the rat enzyme and Gln in the human and mouse enzymes) is an important residue responsible for the catalytic differences between the rat and the human (and mouse) enzymes. With an exchange of a single amino acid, the rat mutant Y104Q behaved like the wild-type human enzyme, and the human mutant Q104Y behaved like the wild-type rat enzyme in their ability to reductively activate the cytotoxic drug CB 1954 (5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide). The study also confirms the conclusion of the x-ray structural analysis of rat enzyme that residue 130 (Thr in the rat enzyme and Ala in the human and mouse enzymes) is positioned near the binding region of the nicotinamide portion of NAD(P)H.

INTRODUCTIONDT-diaphorase (EC 1.6.99.2), also referred to as NAD(P)H:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase, is a flavoprotein that catalyzes the obligatory two-electron reduction of quinones (such as menadione, for structure, see Fig. 1) and quinonoid compounds to hydroquinones, using either NADH or NADPH as the electron donor (1Iyanagi T. Yamazaki I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 216: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 2Iyanagi T. Chem. Scr. 1987; 27A: 31-36Google Scholar).During the last few years, evidence has accumulated that DT-diaphorase is involved in the reductive activation process of several cytotoxic antitumor quinones, such as mitomycins, anthracyclines, and aziridinylbenzoquinones, in cells (3Siegel D. Gibson N.W. Preusch P.C. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7293-7300PubMed Google Scholar, 4Siegel D. Gibson N.W. Preusch P.C. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7483-7489PubMed Google Scholar, 5Walton M.I. Smith P.J. Workman P. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The enzyme can also act as a nitroreductase in that it reduces nitrobenzenes, such as CB 1954 (5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide) (6Boland M.P. Knox R.J. Roberts J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (for structure, see Fig. 1). The enzymatic reduction of these compounds gives rise to reactive intermediates that can then undergo nucleophilic additions with DNA and other macromolecules, suggesting a possible mechanism for their cytotoxicity (7Lin A.J. Cosby L.A. Shansky C.W. Sartorelli A.C. J. Med. Chem. 1972; 15: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cells expressing a higher level of DT-diaphorase have been shown to be more sensitive to the drug treatment (e.g. Refs.8Xu B.H. Gupta V. Singh S.V. Br. J. Cancer. 1994; 69: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Kasahara K. Shibata K. Bando T. Numata Y. Fujimura M. Matsuda T. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 59: 204-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 10Singh S.V. Xu B.H. Gupta V. Emerson E.O. Zaren H.A. Jani J.P. Cancer Lett. 1995; 95: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), strong support for the role of DT-diaphorase in drug activation.While there is experimental evidence that DT-diaphorase is responsible for the reductive activation of antitumor quinones and related compounds, the molecular basis for the activation of these compounds by this enzyme is not yet clearly understood. Particularly, it has been recognized that a major difference exists in the capability of the human and rat DT-diaphorase to activate cytotoxic antitumor compounds. Human DT-diaphorase is not as active as rat DT-diaphorase in activating most, if not all, of the available antitumor quinones and nitrobenzenes. For example, the rate of the reductive activation of the indoloquinone antitumor agent EO9 (3-hydroxymethyl-5-aziridinyl-1-methyl-2-(H-indole-4,7-indione)-propenol) by the rat enzyme was found to be significantly higher than that of the human enzyme (5Walton M.I. Smith P.J. Workman P. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Similarly, the rat enzyme reduces CB 1954 at a faster rate than the human enzyme (ratio of Kcat = 6.4) (6Boland M.P. Knox R.J. Roberts J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), resulting in a large difference in the effectiveness of this prodrug. Therefore, CB 1954 is a very potent antitumor agent in the rat, but is not effective against human tumors in vivo. It has also been shown that the rat enzyme is more effective than the human enzyme in reducing diaziquone and mitomycin C, two clinically used anticancer agents (3Siegel D. Gibson N.W. Preusch P.C. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7293-7300PubMed Google Scholar, 4Siegel D. Gibson N.W. Preusch P.C. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7483-7489PubMed Google Scholar) and also 2,5-dimethyl-3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone, streptonigrin, and mitomycin A (11Beall H.D. Mulcahy T. Siegel D. Traver R.D. Gibson N.W. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3196-3201PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the available cytotoxic drugs are better substrates for the rat enzyme and are not the most ideal prodrugs for activation by DT-diaphorase in human tumors.The mouse DT-diaphorase cDNA was cloned 3 years ago, and the mouse enzyme was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli (12Chen S. Clarke P.E. Martino P.A. Deng P.S.-K. Yeh C.-H. Lee T.D. Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As expected, the amino acid sequence of mouse DT-diaphorase was found to be more homologous to the rat enzyme than the human enzyme. There are 17 and 37 differences, respectively, between the mouse sequence and the rat and human sequences (see Fig. 2). Thus, it was thought that the mouse enzyme would be similar to the rat enzyme in reducing the above prodrugs in a more efficient manner than the human enzyme. Unexpectedly, the mouse enzyme was found to reduce two prodrugs, CB 1954 and EO9, at a rate similar to the human, but not the rat, enzyme (13Chen S. Knox R. Lewis A.D. Friedlos F. Workman P. Deng P.S.-K. Fung M. Ebenstein D. Wu K. Tsai T.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar).Fig. 2Amino acid sequence of DT-diaphorase from rat liver, human liver, and mouse liver. For the amino acid sequence of the human and mouse enzyme, only the residues that are different from those of the rat enzyme are shown. The residues (after the conserved PstI restriction site) that are identical between the human and mouse enzymes, but different from the rat enzyme, are boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In order to determine the region of DT-diaphorase that is responsible for the catalytic differences, two mouse-rat chimeric enzymes were generated utilizing a conserved PstI site in both rat and mouse DT-diaphorase cDNA (13Chen S. Knox R. Lewis A.D. Friedlos F. Workman P. Deng P.S.-K. Fung M. Ebenstein D. Wu K. Tsai T.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). MR-P, a chimeric enzyme that has mouse amino-terminal and rat carboxyl-terminal segments of DT-diaphorase, has been shown to have catalytic properties resembling the rat enzyme, and RM-P, a chimeric enzyme that has rat amino-terminal and mouse carboxyl-terminal segments of DT-diaphorase, has been shown to have catalytic properties resembling the mouse enzyme (13Chen S. Knox R. Lewis A.D. Friedlos F. Workman P. Deng P.S.-K. Fung M. Ebenstein D. Wu K. Tsai T.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these results, we propose that the carboxyl-terminal portion of the enzyme plays an important role in the reduction of cytotoxic drugs.Therefore, it was thought that the catalytic differences among the DT-diaphorase of the three species is due to the amino acid residues that are within the carboxyl-terminal region (after the conserved PstI site) and identical between the human and mouse enzyme, but different from that of the rat enzyme (see Fig. 2). In this study, a series of rat and human DT-diaphorase mutants with changes in the carboxyl-terminal region were generated and analyzed. The study has revealed that residue 104 (Tyr in rat DT-diaphorase and Gln in human and mouse DT-diaphorase) is an important residue responsible for the catalytic differences between the rat, the human (and mouse) enzymes.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn this study, five rat mutants, in which the mutated residues are after the conserved PstI site, were generated. These mutants were converted to the human (mouse) sequence, i.e. Y104Q(r), T130A(r), V204I(r), S218T(r), and L238M(r). In order to prevent confusion, (r) and (h) are included in the name of each mutant to indicate whether it is a rat or human DT-diaphorase mutant, respectively. The mutants were purified to homogeneity, and the purity of the preparations was examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (results not shown). Among the five mutants, Y104Q(r) was found to reduce menadione and CB 1954 at a rate similar to that of the human (and mouse) DT-diaphorase, i.e. similar Vmax values (Table I). In addition, the Km value of T130A for NADH resembles that of the human (and mouse) enzyme. In order to further evaluate the role of residue 104, we prepared the human mutant Q104Y(h). While the mutant Q104Y(h) had a lower menadione reductase activity than the wild-type human DT-diaphorase, its CB 1954 reductase activity was 7-fold that of the wild-type human enzyme, identical to that of the wild-type rat enzyme (Table I). Furthermore, a human double mutant Q104Y/A130T(h) was prepared and found to have a Km value for NADH similar to the wild-type rat enzyme. Therefore, our mutagenesis experiments have provided definitive results indicating that residue 104 of DT-diaphorase plays a critical role in reductive activation of drug CB 1954, and residue 130 is involved in NADH binding.Table IKinetic properties of rat, human, mouse, and mutant forms of DT-diaphoraseNADH-menadione reductase activityNADH-CB1954 reductase activityKm (NADH)Km(K3)VmaxKm (CB1954)VmaxμMμMμmol/min/mgμMnmol/min/mgRat110 ± 102.5 ± 0.12400 ± 300840 ± 40140 ± 8Human220 ± 102.7 ± 0.31100 ± 201370 ± 7020 ± 2Mouse210 ± 204.3 ± 0.41800 ± 2001280 ± 8020 ± 2Y104Q(r)120 ± 102.3 ± 0.21300 ± 50950 ± 6028 ± 2Q104Y(h)110 ± 102.8 ± 0.4520 ± 20830 ± 40147 ± 7T130A(r)200 ± 202.9 ± 0.41300 ± 100890 ± 80138 ± 6Q104Y/A130T(h)120 ± 101.8 ± 0.3440 ± 201540 ± 110129 ± 8V204I(r)110 ± 204.2 ± 0.12400 ± 400890 ± 100149 ± 7Q104Y/I204V(h)210 ± 202.6 ± 0.4870 ± 50860 ± 90142 ± 11S218T(r)140 ± 102.5 ± 0.52600 ± 200820 ± 70138 ± 6Q104Y/T218S(h)140 ± 303.0 ± 0.3670 ± 90980 ± 90134 ± 14L238M(r)320 ± 202.9 ± 0.82200 ± 50840 ± 7089 ± 7Q104Y/M238L(h)250 ± 101.5 ± 0.3710 ± 301110 ± 80131 ± 7 Open table in a new tab The x-ray structure of rat DT-diaphorase reveals that the phenolic ring of Tyr-104, together with the main chain carbonyl of Trp-103, provides the main interactions with the “bottom face” of the isoalloxazine ring (the face opposite to the one that interacts with substrate and nicotinamide) of FAD (18Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In addition, a water molecule hydrogen-bonded to the OH of Tyr-104 is hydrogen-bonded with the O3′ and with a phosphate oxygen of FAD. Replacing Tyr-104 by a Gln manifests itself predominantly through effects in the positioning of the isoalloxazine ring. 2M. A. Bianchet, M. Faig, S. Chen, P. Talalay, and L. M. Amzel, unpublished results. The change in size of the side chain allows the flavin to move deeper into the protein (by approximately 0.7 Å). Such a change may modify the rate of electron transfer between FAD and the substrate menadione. It is not yet known how the drug CB 1954 binds to the active site of the enzyme. However, the results from this study indicate that the positioning of the isoalloxazine ring will have a major effect on the reduction of the prodrug CB 1954. Thr-130 of rat DT-diaphorase is on the outside of the protein in a tight turn of a long loop. Two residues immediately following this turn, Tyr-126 and Tyr-128, are involved in interactions with the nicotinamide or with the substrate. All of the kinetic effects of substituting Thr-130 with Ala are probably a result of small local modifications of the main chain conformation that result in slightly altered positions of the side chains of Tyr-126 and Tyr-128. The observed effects of the mutations agree, in general, with the structural observations: change of Tyr-104 affects the Vmax (by affecting the relation between the flavin and the nicotinamide and the substrate), and change of Thr-130 affects NADH binding.In addition to the mutations at positions 104 and 130 which led to major changes in the catalytic properties, V204I(r) was found to have a Km value for menadione similar to that of the wild-type mouse enzyme (Table I). The x-ray structural analysis of the rat enzyme has revealed that the adenine ring of FAD interacts strongly with Arg-201 (18Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It is thought that the mutation may modify the interaction of menadione with the enzyme by a slight change in the FAD binding environment. The human double mutant Q104Y/I204V(h) was found to have a Km value for menadione similar to the wild-type rat enzyme and a Km value for NADH similar to the wild-type human enzyme. Residue 238 is situated in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the enzyme (18Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 19Chen S. Deng P.S.K. Bailey J.M. Swiederek K.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Both the rat mutant L238M(r) and the human mutant Q104Y/M238L(h) were found to have large Km values for NADH (Table I). In addition, the Vmax value of L238M(r) for CB 1954 was slightly lower than that of the wild-type rat enzyme. It is thought that mutations at this position may affect the catalytic function in an indirect fashion.Flavones were found to be potent inhibitors of DT-diaphorase (20Liu X.F. Liu M.L. Iyanagi T. Legesse K. Lee T.D. Chen S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 911-915PubMed Google Scholar), and the human and rat forms of the enzyme were found to be more sensitive to flavones than the mouse enzyme (12Chen S. Clarke P.E. Martino P.A. Deng P.S.-K. Yeh C.-H. Lee T.D. Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Studies involving rat-mouse chimeric enzymes have generated results indicating that the carboxyl-terminal region of DT-diaphorase plays a critical role in the binding differences for flavones between the rat and mouse enzyme (13Chen S. Knox R. Lewis A.D. Friedlos F. Workman P. Deng P.S.-K. Fung M. Ebenstein D. Wu K. Tsai T.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar). Since none of the mutations in this study modified the binding affinities for flavones, it is thought that the mutated amino acid residues are not involved in the binding of flavones (results not shown).Perhaps the most important implication of the results from our evaluation of various rat and human DT-diaphorase mutants is its potential therapeutic utility. It is now known that by affecting the position of FAD, residue 104 plays a critical role in the reductive activation of cytotoxic drugs such as CB 1954. Suitable drugs that are effectively activated by human DT-diaphorase can be developed by proper modification of the structure of existing drugs, allowing them to interact better with FAD in the human enzyme. Structure-activity studies of a series of the derivatives of CB 1954 have revealed that a more hydrophobic side chain at the C1 position improves the interaction with human DT-diaphorase. 3R. Knox, F. Friedlos, P. S.-K. Deng, and S. Chen, unpublished results. In addition, the human mutant Q104Y(h) will be a good candidate for gene therapy involving DT-diaphorase. 9 and 40% of the population have been found to be homozygous and heterozygous for a P187S mutation of DT-diaphorase, respectively (21Kuehl B.L. Paterson J.W.E. Peacock J.W. Paterson M.C. Rauth A.M. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The P187S mutation results in an enzyme with one-twentieth of the FAD binding affinity and one-eighth the activity of the wild-type human enzyme. 4K. Wu, P. S.-K. Deng, and S. Chen, unpublished results. It is thought that the population with the P187S mutation might have a reduced ability to activate cytotoxic quinone drugs, and, therefore, the mutation should have a significant impact for treatment of cancer patients with the P187S mutation. It might be possible to introduce the human Q104Y(h) mutant into the cancerous tissues of these patients to increase the response to cytotoxic drug treatment. Such a possibility is currently being evaluated in our laboratory.

The enzyme can also act as a nitroreductase in that it reduces nitrobenzenes, such as CB 1954 (5-(aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide) (6Boland M.P. Knox R.J. Roberts J.J. Biochem.

Cancer Lett. 1995; 95: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), strong support for the role of DT-diaphorase in drug activation.While there is experimental evidence that DT-diaphorase is responsible for the reductive activation of antitumor quinones and related compounds, the molecular basis for the activation of these compounds by this enzyme is not yet clearly understood. Particularly, it has been recognized that a major difference exists in the capability of the human and rat DT-diaphorase to activate cytotoxic antitumor compounds. Human DT-diaphorase is not as active as rat DT-diaphorase in activating most, if not all, of the available antitumor quinones and nitrobenzenes. For example, the rate of the reductive activation of the indoloquinone antitumor agent EO9 (3-hydroxymethyl-5-aziridinyl-1-methyl-2-(H-indole-4,7-indione)-propenol) by the rat enzyme was found to be significantly higher than that of the human enzyme (5Walton M.I. Smith P.J. Workman P. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Similarly, the rat enzyme reduces CB 1954 at a faster rate than the human enzyme (ratio of Kcat = 6.4) (6Boland M.P. Knox R.J. Roberts J.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), resulting in a large difference in the effectiveness of this prodrug. Therefore, CB 1954 is a very potent antitumor agent in the rat, but is not effective against human tumors in vivo. It has also been shown that the rat enzyme is more effective than the human enzyme in reducing diaziquone and mitomycin C, two clinically used anticancer agents (3Siegel D. Gibson N.W. Preusch P.C. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7293-7300PubMed Google Scholar, 4Siegel D. Gibson N.W. Preusch P.C. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7483-7489PubMed Google Scholar) and also 2,5-dimethyl-3,6-diaziridinyl-1,4-benzoquinone, streptonigrin, and mitomycin A (11Beall H.D. Mulcahy T. Siegel D. Traver R.D. Gibson N.W. Ross D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3196-3201PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that the available cytotoxic drugs are better substrates for the rat enzyme and are not the most ideal prodrugs for activation by DT-diaphorase in human tumors.The mouse DT-diaphorase cDNA was cloned 3 years ago, and the mouse enzyme was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli (12Chen S. Clarke P.E. Martino P.A. Deng P.S.-K. Yeh C.-H. Lee T.D. Prochaska H.J. Talalay P. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1296-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). As expected, the amino acid sequence of mouse DT-diaphorase was found to be more homologous to the rat enzyme than the human enzyme. There are 17 and 37 differences, respectively, between the mouse sequence and the rat and human sequences (see Fig. 2). Thus, it was thought that the mouse enzyme would be similar to the rat enzyme in reducing the above prodrugs in a more efficient manner than the human enzyme. Unexpectedly, the mouse enzyme was found to reduce two prodrugs, CB 1954 and EO9, at a rate similar to the human, but not the rat, enzyme (13Chen S. Knox R. Lewis A.D. Friedlos F. Workman P. Deng P.S.-K. Fung M. Ebenstein D. Wu K. Tsai T.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar).In order to determine the region of DT-diaphorase that is responsible for the catalytic differences, two mouse-rat chimeric enzymes were generated utilizing a conserved PstI site in both rat and mouse DT-diaphorase cDNA (13Chen S. Knox R. Lewis A.D. Friedlos F. Workman P. Deng P.S.-K. Fung M. Ebenstein D. Wu K. Tsai T.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2). MR-P, a chimeric enzyme that has mouse amino-terminal and rat carboxyl-terminal segments of DT-diaphorase, has been shown to have catalytic properties resembling the rat enzyme, and RM-P, a chimeric enzyme that has rat amino-terminal and mouse carboxyl-terminal segments of DT-diaphorase, has been shown to have catalytic properties resembling the mouse enzyme (13Chen S. Knox R. Lewis A.D. Friedlos F. Workman P. Deng P.S.-K. Fung M. Ebenstein D. Wu K. Tsai T.-M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 934-939PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these results, we propose that the carboxyl-terminal portion of the enzyme plays an important role in the reduction of cytotoxic drugs.Therefore, it was thought that the catalytic differences among the DT-diaphorase of the three species is due to the amino acid residues that are within the carboxyl-terminal region (after the conserved PstI site) and identical between the human and mouse enzyme, but different from that of the rat enzyme (see Fig. 2). In this study, a series of rat and human DT-diaphorase mutants with changes in the carboxyl-terminal region were generated and analyzed. The study has revealed that residue 104 (Tyr in rat DT-diaphorase and Gln in human and mouse DT-diaphorase) is an important residue responsible for the catalytic differences between the rat, the human (and mouse) enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1986265010,"APOBEC-1 is a catalytic subunit of an apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA editing enzyme complex. In humans it is expressed only in the intestine, whereas in mice it is expressed in both the liver and intestine. APOBEC-1 exists as a spontaneous homodimer (Lau, P. P., Zhu, H.-J., Baldini, A., Charnsangavej, C., and Chan, L. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 91, 8522-8526). We tested the editing activity and dimerization potential of three different mouse APOBEC-1 mutants using in vitro editing activity assay and immunoprecipitation in the presence of epitope-tagged APOBEC-1. One catalytically inactive mutant, mu1 (H61K/C93S/C96S), that retains its capacity to dimerize with wild-type APOBEC-1 was found to inhibit the editing activity of the latter and was thus a dominant negative mutant. Two other inactive mutants that dimerized poorly with APOBEC-1 failed to inhibit its activity. Intravenous injection of a mu1 adenovirus, Admu1, in C57BL/6J mice in vivo resulted in liver-specific expression of mu1 mRNA. On days 4 and 9 after virus injection, endogenous hepatic apoB mRNA editing was 23.3 ± 5.0 and 36.8 ± 5.7%, respectively, compared with 65.3 ± 11 and 71.3 ± 5.2%, respectively, for luciferase adenovirus-treated animals. Plasma apoB-100 accounted for 95 and 93% of total plasma apoB in Admu1 animals on days 4 and 9, respectively, compared with 78 and 72% in luciferase adenovirus animals. Plasma cholesterol on day 9 was 98 ± 17 mg/dl in the mu1-treated animals, substantially higher than phosphate-buffered saline-treated (57 ± 9 mg/dl) or luciferase-treated (71 ± 12 mg/dl) controls. Fast protein liquid chromatography analysis of mouse plasma showed that the intermediate density/low density lipoprotein fractions in the animals treated with the dominant negative mutant adenovirus were much higher than those in controls. We conclude that active APOBEC-1 functions as a dimer and its activity is inhibited by a dominant negative mutant. Furthermore, apoB mRNA editing determines the availability of apoB-100, which in turn limits the amount of intermediate density/low density lipoprotein that can be formed in mice. Liver-specific inhibition of apoB mRNA editing is an important component of any strategy to enhance the value of mice as a model for human lipoprotein metabolism.

Its value as a model for human disease, however, is limited by the fact that there is a substantial difference in lipoprotein metabolism between the two species.

In humans, editing occurs exclusively in the small intestine but not in the liver. Therefore, the human liver produces apoB-100 and the small intestine produces apoB-48. In mice, apoB mRNA editing occurs in both the small intestine and the liver. Therefore, the amount of apoB-100 produced by the liver is very small, and mice have very low levels of circulating apoB-100; consequently, they have low levels of intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL), atherogenic lipoproteins that require apoB-100 as an essential component.ApoB mRNA editing is mediated by a multiprotein enzyme complex.

We then made use of the technique of adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to deliver a dominant negative mutant APOBEC-1 to the mouse liver in vivo. We found that mice treated with the dominant negative mutant APOBEC-1 developed significant hypercholesterolemia because of a marked increase in IDL/LDL cholesterol.

Ohbo K. Nakamura M. Takashita T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 179-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis has led to the discovery of two regions in the human IL-4 molecule that are important for interaction with the receptor chains (for review see 12Duschl A. Müller T. Sebald W. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1995; 96: 87-94Google Scholar). Substitution of glutamic acid 9 (Glu9) or arginine 88 (Arg88) leads to a near complete loss of binding to IL-4Rα (13Kruse N. Shen B.J. Arnold S. Tony H.P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). A second important region of the human IL-4 molecule is defined by mutations of arginine 121, tyrosine 124, and serine 125, close to the C terminus of the protein. Mutations at these positions do not interfere with IL-4Rα binding but can severely impair cellular responses, because they result in loss of interaction with γc (14Duschl A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 305-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The most efficient single site mutant of this type is Y124D, which does not induce T-cell proliferation but is a partial agonist for up-regulation of CD23 on B-cells (15Kruse N. Tony H.P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast, a double mutant where both Arg121 and Tyr124 have been replaced by aspartic acid (RY) has no agonistic activity in any assay employed so far (16Tony H.-P. Shen B.-J. Reusch P. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). RY is therefore a perfect high affinity antagonist for human IL-4, as well as for IL-13, which also uses IL-4Rα for signal transduction (16Tony H.-P. Shen B.-J. Reusch P. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Smerz-Bertling C. Duschl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 966-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). IL-4 antagonists may provide an effective way for the therapy of TH2-dominated diseases. The major obstacle for testing in vivo biological tolerance and therapeutic effects of IL-4 antagonists is the species specificity of IL-4. There is approximately 60% DNA sequence homology (18Lee F. Yokota T. Otsuka T. Meyerson P. Villaret D. Coffman R. Mosmann T. Rennick D. Roehm N. Smith C. Zlotnik A. Arai K.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunol. 1987; 138: 1813-1816PubMed Google Scholar). Due to the lack of receptor binding, human IL-4 antagonists cannot be effective in mice. This has prompted us to develop an efficient antagonist for IL-4 in the mouse system. BALB/c mice 6-8 weeks of age were purchased from Charles River/Wiga. The Spodoptera frugiperda insect cell line Sf9 was cultured in Insect Xpress medium (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) without adjuvants at 27°C in a 2-liter spinner flask aerated with 100% oxygen. Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus DNA (BaculoGold™ DNA) was from Pharmingen (Hamburg, Germany). Murine cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 8% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, supplemented with 100 ng/ml IL-2 for CTLL-2 cells and with 5% culture supernatant of murine mIL-3-producing X63Ag8-653 BPV cells (21Karasuyama H. Melchers F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1988; 18: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) for BA/F3 cells. Recombinant IL-4 proteins were produced in Sf9 cells following Baculovirus infection. The pEP-B-splice mIL-4 plasmid containing the cDNA for mouse IL-4 was kindly provided by Dr. Werner Müller (University of Cologne, Germany) (22Müller W. Kühn R. Rajewsky K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A fragment encoding the cDNA of mouse IL-4 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with the synthetic 5′ primer 5′-CGCGGATCCCATATCCACGGA-3′ and the 3′ primer 5′-GCCGGATCCTACGAGTAATCC-3′, comprising a BamHI site and the first (for the 5′ primer) and, respectively, last (for the 3′ primer) four codons of wild type IL-4. The QY mutant gene was constructed using the 3′ primer 5′-GCCGGATCCTACGAGTCATCCATATCCATGATGC-3′, resulting in substitution of both glutamine 116 and tyrosine 119 by aspartic acid. The constructs were sequenced and cloned into the Baculovirus transfer vector pAc-GP67B (Pharmingen). The generation of recombinant viruses by cotransfection of transfer plasmid and BaculoGold™ DNA into insect cells, and the selection of recombinant viruses by plaque assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer of the BaculoGold™ system. Cells were infected at a density of 2-4 × 106 cells/ml. The IL-4-containing supernatant was collected 72 h after infection. Escherichia coli-derived recombinant IL-4 was from PeproTec (Rocky Hill, NJ). Sf9 supernatant was extensively dialyzed against 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, followed by cation exchange chromatography on a CM-Sepharose fast flow column (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) equilibrated with 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, at 4°C. Bound protein was eluted with a 0-1 M NaCl gradient. The material was applied to a reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography column and eluted by a gradient of acetonitrile from 30 to 50%. IL-4 and QY mutant were identified by immunoblotting using rat anti-mouse IL-4 antibody (BVD4-1D11; Pharmingen). The yield of purified recombinant protein was approximately 1 mg/liter Sf9 supernatant. Freeze-dried protein was stored at −20°C and dissolved in H2O before use. Protein was determined by the BCA method using bovine serum albumin as standard. The recombinant extracellular domain of mouse IL-4Rα (IL-4-BP) produced in Sf9 cells was a kind gift of Dr. F.R. Seiler (Behringwerke AG, Marburg, Germany). The protein (50 μg) was biotinylated by incubating with 6 nmol NHS-LS-Biotin (Pierce, Oud Beijerland, Netherlands) in 250 μl of 0.1 M NaHCO3, pH 8.0, for 2 h at 0°C. After purification by P6DG gelchromatography (Bio-Rad, München, Germany) in phosphate-buffered saline, the protein was frozen in aliquots at −20°C. The biotinylated IL-4-BP was immobilized to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip CM5 (Pharmacia Biosensor AB, Uppsala, Sweden) at a density of 80-100 pg/mm2 in a BIAcore™ 2000 system. The association and dissociation of IL-4 and QY in HBS buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P-20) were analyzed at a flow rate of 50 μl/min and 25°C. A set of sensograms was recorded at six different analytic concentrations. The data were evaluated using the BIA evaluation 2.1 software provided with the system as described (23Shen B.-J. Hage T. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 252-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The rate constants evaluated from 15 independent measurements were used to calculate the mean values ± standard deviation. Cytokine-induced proliferation of cells was determined by [3H]TdR incorporation as described (24Duschl A. Jahn U. Bertling C. Sebald W. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1992; 3: 97-102PubMed Google Scholar). CTLL-2 cells were used at a density of 5 × 104/ml and BA/F3 cells at 5 × 105/ml. T-cell-depleted splenic B-cells were prepared from BALB/c mice and tested following standard procedures (25Coligan J.E. Kruisbeek A.M. Margulis D.H. Shevach E.M. Strober W. Current Protocols in Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991Google Scholar). Briefly, splenic cell suspensions were incubated with rat anti-mouse Thy1.2 antibody (30H12; Pharmingen) for 30 min, followed by incubation at 37°C for 45 min with Low-Tox®-H rabbit complement (Cedar Lane, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Viable and resting B-cells were separated on the 70-65% interphase of a Percoll gradient (Pharmacia) and cultured at a density of 106/ml with 5 μg/ml Salmonella typhimurium LPS (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) plus the indicated concentrations of cytokines for 48 h. All measurements were evaluated by means of the GraFit program (Erithacus Software) using the equation y = a/(1+[X/I]expS) + back (IC50− 4 parameter logistic). The inhibitory constant Ki was determined using the equation Ki = ID50/(1 + [L]/ED50), where [L] is the concentration of ligand (IL-4), ID50 is the concentration of QY required to decrease cellular response by half, and ED50 is the IL-4 concentration required for half-maximal cellular response. Splenic B-cells (106/ml) were cultured in a 96-well plate with 5 μg/ml LPS and IL-4 or QY as indicated. Cells were centrifuged after 40 h, and supernatant was withdrawn. After blocking with 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, cells were stained in opaque microtiter plates with 1 μg/well rat anti-mouse CD23 (B3B4; Pharmingen) at 4°C for 1 h. Following incubation with goat anti-rat IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 45 min, detection was performed with an enhanced chemoluminescene based method (26Lischke A. Pagany M. Kammer W. Friedrich K. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) using a Microlumat LB 96-P luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). ED50, ID50, and Ki were calculated as described above. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was determined as described (17Smerz-Bertling C. Duschl A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 966-970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with cytokines and lysed, and proteins were precipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or with anti-Stat6 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, anti-phosphotyrosine (RC20; Affinity, Nottingham, UK), anti-Stat6 (Santa Cruz) or anti-Jak3 antibody (Santa Cruz) were used for immunodetection. Previous experiments have shown that the receptor binding affinity of IL-4 is mainly determined by the high affinity interaction with IL-4Rα. Therefore, the kinetics of interaction between mouse IL-4 proteins and the mouse IL-4Rα chain were studied by means of a BIAcore™ 2000 system employing a recombinant extracellular domain, IL-4-BP, immobilized to a biosensor matrix. The rate constants for the dissociation of the complex between IL-4-BP and IL-4 or QY were indistinguishable. The koff for both proteins was about 2 × 10−3 s−1 (Fig. 1 and Table I). The association rate constants were similar, but consistently a 50% lower on rate was found for QY in comparison with IL-4. The dissociation equilibrium constant Kd calculated as koff/kon was about 400 pM for IL-4 and 800 pM for the QY variant.Table IDissociation (koff) and association (kon) rate constants of IL-4 and the QY variant with IL-4-BPkonkoffKdM−1 s−1s−1pMIL-4Exp. 14.6 ± 0.69 × 1061.8 ± 0.36 × 10−3390Exp. 25.1 ± 0.77 × 1061.9 ± 0.48 × 10−3340QYExp. 12.2 ± 0.37 × 1061.8 ± 0.54 × 10−3820Exp. 22.3 ± 0.60 × 1061.9 ± 0.57 × 10−3830 Open table in a new tab The effects of the wild type and QY mutant protein on cell proliferation were determined with highly purified splenic B-cells co-cultured with LPS, the T-cell line CTLL-2, and the pre-B-cell line BA/F3. The biological activity of IL-4 produced by Sf9 cells was identical to commercially available IL-4 produced by E. coli (Fig. 2A). IL-4 induced proliferation of splenic B-cells, CTLL-2 cells, and BA/F3 cells (Fig. 2, A-C). The ED50 values are summarized in Table II. The QY mutant by itself had no detectable activity in proliferation assays (Fig. 2, A and B) but inhibited IL-4-stimulated proliferation of all three cell types in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 2, D-F). The concentrations required for half-maximal inhibition of IL-4-induced proliferation are given in Table II. As expected, in more sensitive cells a higher dose of inhibitor was needed to block IL-4-induced responses.Table IIEffective and inhibitory doses of IL-4 and QY mutant for proliferation in different cell typesCell typeMean ED50Mean ID50Mean KipMnMpMBA/F367 ± 60 (n = 7)3 ± 0.7 (n = 6)190 ± 150 (n = 6)Splenic B-cell16 ± 10 (n = 3)37 ± 0.9 (n = 3)600 ± 380 (n = 3)CTLL-29 ± 7.4 (n = 7)61 ± 53 (n = 2)520 ± 300 (n = 2) Open table in a new tab The low affinity IgE receptor, CD23, is an IL-4-inducible B-cell differentiation marker. Half-maximal CD23 expression was induced by 19 pM IL-4 (Fig. 3A). Similiar to the proliferation assays, there was no detectable activity of the QY variant. QY prevented the IL-4-induced CD23 expression with half-maximal inhibition reached at about 95-fold excess of the mutant (Fig. 3B). The signal transduction of cytokines involves the activation of various tyrosine kinases and rapid phosphorylation of their substrates. IL-4 stimulates phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor Stat6 and the tyrosine kinase Jak3 (27Ivashkiv L.B. Immunity. 1995; 3: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine whether the QY mutant could inhibit IL-4 induced signaling, we have measured Stat6 and Jak3 phosphorylation in BA/F3 cells. IL-4 at 1 nM concentration induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both proteins, whereas the same amount of the QY mutant did not stimulate phosphorylation (Fig. 4). A 500-fold excess of the QY variant completely inhibited the IL-4-induced response (Fig. 4). Antagonistic properties of human IL-4 variants are caused by the deletion of a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the IL-4 molecule and by the introduction of an electrostatic mismatch (28Müller T. Sebald W. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). No local instability is introduced in the protein structure, because main chains structures of antagonistic mutants are identical compared with wild type (29Müller T. Dieckmann T. Sebald W. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 424-436Google Scholar). No structural data on mouse IL-4 are available, but some mutation studies have been reported. A deletion mutant of murine IL-4 lacking residues 118-120 has impaired activity in a proliferation assay with the T-cell line CT4R but retains high affinity binding to IL-4Rα (30Morrison B.W. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11957-11963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such a deletion, however, may alter the protein structure, and inhibition of wild type protein was not tested. In the same study, replacement of Gln116 with alanine had only minor effects on receptor binding and biological activity (30Morrison B.W. Leder P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11957-11963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A murine IL-4 variant with a single site mutation of tyrosine 119 (Y119D) has been mentioned in the literature, but in one report no data were shown (31Aversa G. Punnonen J. Cocks B.G. de Waal Malefyt R. Vega Jr., F. Zurawski S.M. Zurawski G. de Vries J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2213-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and in another one the same mutant induced agonistic effects similar to those of wild type IL-4 in differentiation assays, like MHC II up-regulation on B-cells (32Gessner A. Blum H. Röllinghoff M. Immunobiology. 1995; 194: 168-169Google Scholar). This is to be expected for the Y119D mutant, because murine and human γc interact in a structurally different way with IL-4. Human IL-4 can productively interact both with human and murine γc, but human γc is most severely affected by mutations in Tyr124 (13Kruse N. Shen B.J. Arnold S. Tony H.P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and murine γc is most severely affected by mutations in Arg121 (33Bönsch D. Kammer W. Lischke A. Friedrich K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8452-8457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For this reason, and in consideration of the partial agonist activities of human Y124D (13Kruse N. Shen B.J. Arnold S. Tony H.P. Müller T. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5121-5129Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 15Kruse N. Tony H.P. Sebald W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3237-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), we decided to create the QY double mutant, as a murine analog to the complete human IL-4 antagonist RY (16Tony H.-P. Shen B.-J. Reusch P. Sebald W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 659-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As shown here, the QY mutant was by itself inactive and completely antagonistic for wild type IL-4, in all assays performed. Like IL-4, IL-13 can also direct IgE class switching in human B-cells (34Punnonen J. Aversa G. Cocks B.G. McKenzie A.N.J. Menon S. Zurawski G. De Waal Malefyt R. De Vries J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Med. 1994; 179: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) but apparently not in the mouse, because IL-4 knockout mice are unable to produce IgE (36Kühn R. Rajewsky K. Müller W. Science. 1991; 254: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1101) Google Scholar, 37Kopf M. Le Gros G. Bachmann M. Lamers M.C. Bluethmann H. Köhler G. Nature. 1993; 362: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). Anti-IL-4 antibodies or soluble IL-4 receptors may not be sufficient to treat for example type I hypersensitivity in humans, because neither would interfere with IL-13. Furthermore, both reagents can not only inhibit but also enhance effects of IL-4 by acting as carrier molecules that increase the lifetime of IL-4 in the serum (38Maliszewski C.R. Sato T.A. Davison B. Jacobs C.A. Finkelman F.D. Fanslow W.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1994; 206: 233-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Antagonistic IL-4 mutants will inhibit both IL-4- and IL-13-mediated responses and cannot increase agonistic IL-4 effects. Because cytokine mutants are structurally nearly identical to the wild type protein, they should provide good immunological tolerance as well. The QY variant should allow to study such questions in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1988869636,"Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) transduce a very large number of cellular regulatory signals. Several recent papers have shown that the larger heterotrimeric G proteins are regulated by a class of molecules known as the RGS proteins (regulators of G protein-signaling family) that are analogous to the GAPs (GTPase activating proteins), which regulate small monomeric G proteins. Iyengar summarizes this evidence and discusses the mechanism of action of the RGS proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2039504078,"BCR-ABL is a chimeric oncoprotein that exhibits deregulated tyrosine kinase activity and is implicated in the pathogenesis of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive leukemia. We have previously shown SH2-containing phosphotyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 forms stable complexes with BCR-ABL and Grb2 in BCR-ABL-transformed cells (Tauchi, T., Feng, G. S., Shen, R., Song, H. Y., Donner, D., Pawson, T., and Broxmeyer, H. E. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 15381-15387). To elucidate the structural requirement of BCR-ABL for the interactions with SH2-containing signaling molecules, we examined a series of BCR-ABL mutants which include the Grb2 binding site-deleted BCR-ABL (1-63 BCR/ABL), the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL (64-509 BCR/ABL), and the SH2 domain-deleted BCR-ABL (BCR/ABL δSH2). These BCR-ABL mutants were previously shown to reduce the transforming activity in fibroblasts. We found that the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and the interactions of BCR-ABL, SHP-2, and Grb2. In vitro kinase assays have also shown that the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL mutant did not phosphorylate GST-SHP-2 in vitro. SHP-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in BCR/ABL p210-transformed cells; however, this interaction was not observed in the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL mutant. Therefore the tetramerization domain of BCR-ABL is essential for interactions of these downstream molecules.

Therefore the tetramerization domain of BCR-ABL is essential for interactions of these downstream molecules. The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) is one of the best known cytogenetic abnormalities in human hematologic malignancy (1Rowley J.D. Nature. 1973; 243: 290-293Google Scholar, 2Tauchi T. Broxmeyer H.E. Int. J. Hematol. 1995; 61: 105-112Google Scholar). It is fundamentally characteristic of chronic myelogenous leukemia, but it also is seen in many cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and occasionally in acute myelogenous leukemia. The molecular basis of the Ph1 chromosome involves the reciprocal translocation between the BCR gene on chromosome 22 and c-ABL on chromosome 9 (3Heiterkamp N. Stam K. Groffen J. Nature. 1985; 315: 758-761Google Scholar). The normal cellular function of the BCR gene is unknown, but c-ABL is the cellular homologue of the transforming gene of Abelson leukemia virus and belongs to the broad family of nonreceptor protein kinases (4Goff S.P. Gilboa E. Witte O.N. Baltimore D. Cell. 1980; 22: 777-785Google Scholar). The chimeric fusion gene (BCR-ABL) results in truncation of c-ABL at its amino-terminal exon by BCR sequences, leading to a fusion protein (BCR-ABL) with deregulated tyrosine kinase activities (5Konopka J.B. Watanabe S.M. Witte O.N. Cell. 1984; 37: 1035-1042Google Scholar, 6Kloetzer W. Kurzrock R. Smith L. Talpatz M. Speller M. Gutterman J. Arlinghaus R. Virology. 1985; 140: 230-238Google Scholar). BCR-ABL has been shown to transform fibroblast and hematopoietic cells in vitro (7Young J.C. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4079-4087Google Scholar, 8Lugo T.G. Pendergast A.M. Witte O.N.

Thus, BCR-ABL has been linked as a decisive inciting factor in the pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The connection between the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase and downstream signal transduction pathways is provided by multiple functional domains (10McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell.

The first 63 amino acids of BCR contain a coiled-coil tetramerization domain which activates the tyrosine kinase as well as the F-actin binding function of BCR-ABL (10McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Google Scholar, 11McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Google Scholar). The second BCR region, between amino acids 176 and 242, contains a tyrosine residue at position 177, which becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine and binds to the SH2 domain of the adapter protein Grb2 (12Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 175-185Google Scholar, 13Puil L. Liu J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Bowtell D.

Mutation of tyrosine 177 to phenylalanine abolishes Grb2 binding and blocks hematopoietic transformation (12Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 175-185Google Scholar). Three regions in ABL, the SH2 domain, the tyrosine kinase domain, and the F-actin binding domain, are required for transformation of fibroblasts (14McWirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that SHP-2, a phosphotyrosine phosphatase widely expressed in all the tissues in mammals, complexes with BCR-ABL and Grb2 in BCR-ABL-transformed cells (19Tauchi T.

In the present study we examined the structural requirement of BCR-ABL for interaction with SH2-containing signal transduction molecules. It was found that the tetramerization-deleted BCR-ABL lacked both tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and the association with SHP-2 and Grb2. SHP-2 co-immunoprecipitates with the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase 1The abbreviations used are: PI 3-kinasephosphatidylinositol 3-kinaseGSTglutathione S-transferasemAbmonoclonal antibody. in BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells; however, this interaction was not observed in the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL-transfected cells. These results suggest that the tetramerization domain of BCR-ABL is essential for interactions of these downstream signaling molecules and that these molecular interactions are involved in the transformation of BCR-ABL. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase glutathione S-transferase monoclonal antibody. Polyclonal anti-SHP-2 antibody (raised against a GST fusion protein containing the SHP-2 residues 2-216) was as described previously (19Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Shen R. Song H.Y. Donner D. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15381-15387Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (PY20), anti-Grb2 mAb (GR81), anti-SHP-2 mAb, and affinity-purified anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Affinity-purified anti-Grb2 (raised against a peptide corresponding to residues 195-217 mapping at the carboxyl terminus of human Grb2) and GST-Grb2 fusion protein (corresponding to amino acids 1-217 of Grb2 of murine origin) and anti-GST mAb were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-ABL mAb (24Li W. Nishimura R. Kshishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Google Scholar) was purchased from Oncogene Science Inc. (Cambridge, MA). The NSF/N1.H7 cell line was obtained from Dr. H. Scott Boswell (Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN) and has been described elsewhere (20Mandanas R.A. Leibowitz D.S. Gharenbaghi K. Tauchi T. Burgess G.S. Miyazawa K. Jayaram H.N. Boswell H.S. Blood. 1993; 82: 1838-1847Google Scholar). This cell line was cultured in McCoy's 5A modified medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and 15% WEHI-3 cell line conditioned media. Expression plasmids used in this study were as previously described (11McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Google Scholar, 14McWirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J.

The p210 coding fragment was cleaved from pSP65BCR-ABLp210 (21Feinstein E. Cimino G. Gale R.P. Alimena G. Berthier R. Kishi K. Goldman J. Zaccaria A. Berrebi A. Canaani E. Oncogene. 1991; 4: 1477-1481Google Scholar) and cloned into the retroviral vector pSLXCMV (11McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Google Scholar). NSF/N1.H7 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously (22Tauchi T. Boswell H.S. Leibowitz D. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 167-175Google Scholar). Beginning 48 h after electroporation, cells were selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Within 10 days of plating in the selection medium, G418-resistant sublines were obtained. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (22Tauchi T. Boswell H.S. Leibowitz D. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 167-175Google Scholar). GST-SHP-2 SH2 (amino acids 2-216) fusion protein was freshly prepared for the in vitro binding experiments (19Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Shen R. Song H.Y. Donner D. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15381-15387Google Scholar). To dissociate and denature the preexisting protein complexes, cells were lysed in a small volume (107 cells in 100 μl) of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad), 1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 mg/ml leupeptin, 100 mM sodium fluoride, and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate). After centrifugation, the supernatants were heated to 950C for 5 min, cooled on ice, and then diluted with Triton X-100 lysis buffer to 1 ml so that the final concentration of SDS was 0.1%. For in vitro binding assays, glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with bound fusion proteins (approximately 5 μg of fusion protein per binding reaction) were incubated in denatured proteins at 40C for 90 min. The beads were washed four times with TNGN washing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Bio-Rad), 100 mM sodium fluoride, and 2 mM sodium orthovanadate) before analysis. For immune complex kinase assays, immunoprecipitated proteins were washed three times with TNGN washing buffer and one time with kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol). The resulting complexes were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 2 μg of GST-SHP-2 fusion protein and 10 μCi of 32P (Amersham Corp.) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were boiled for 5 min after addition of 30 μl of SDS-sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to membranes for autoradiography. The structures of the different BCR-ABL fusion constructs are shown in Fig. 1. Deletions of the coiled-coil tetramerization domain (64-509 BCR/ABL), the second BCR region including the Grb2 binding site (1-63 BCR/ABL), and the SH2 domain (BCR/δSH2 ABL) have all been shown to reduce BCR-ABL transformation of rodent fibroblast cells (14McWirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Google Scholar). Furthermore, these BCR-ABL mutant transfected cell lines, except 64-509 BCR/ABL-transfected cells, were growth factor-independent for proliferation (data not shown). These mutants were chosen to study the structural requirements for the interaction between the SH2-containing signaling molecules and BCR-ABL. These BCR-ABL transfected cell lines were shown to express similar amounts of BCR-ABL protein by immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A). To assay for activation of the tyrosine kinase, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ABL, and these immune complexes were analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10 + PY20) immunoblotting (Fig. 2B). The 1-63 BCR/ABL, 1-509 BCR/ABL, BCR/ABL P210, and BCR/δSH2 ABL proteins contained high levels of phosphotyrosine, whereas phosphotyrosine was at a very low level in the 64-509 BCR/ABL mutant (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Autophosphorylation of BCR-ABL proteins in vivo. A, cell lysates from the indicated cell lines were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-ABL or mouse immunoglobulins as a control (C, as noted for immunoprecipitation). Immunoprecipitates were separated by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted with anti-ABL. The background band around 50 kDa is the immunoglobulin heavy chain from the immunoprecipitation. B, equal amounts of total proteins from the indicated cell lines were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-ABL, and these immune complexes were subjected to immunoblot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10 + PY20). Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the tyrosine phosphorylation status of SHP-2 in these cell lines, it was first shown via immunoprecipitation that all cell lines expressed equivalent amounts of SHP-2 protein (Fig. 3A). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-SHP-2 antibodies and precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAbs (Fig. 3B). SHP-2 was phosphorylated on tyrosine in all of the BCR-ABL transfected cells except for the 64-509 BCR/ABL mutant (Fig. 3B). To determine the functional domains of BCR-ABL that are responsible for the interaction with SHP-2, cells were lysed and heat- denatured at 950C in the presence of SDS. These lysates were incubated with GST-SHP-2 SH2 fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione beads. The unbound proteins were removed and immunoblotted with anti-ABL mAb (Fig. 3C). SHP-2 was able to bind to all of the BCR-ABL proteins except for the 64-509 BCR/ABL mutant. These results demonstrate that the coiled-coil tetramerization domain of BCR-ABL is required for the interaction between SHP-2 and BCR-ABL. Potential mediators of BCR-ABL-induced Ras activation in hematopoietic cells include the Shc adapter proteins and SHP-2 phosphatase (13Puil L. Liu J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Bowtell D. Pelicci P.G.

Both Shc-Grb2 and SHP-2-Grb2 complexes have been implicated in epidermal growth factor- or platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated Ras activation (23Rozakis-Adock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Google Scholar, 24Li W. Nishimura R. Kshishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Google Scholar, 25Pronk G.J.

We have previously shown that BCR-ABL co-immunoprecipitated with Shc, Grb2, and SHP-2 in BCR-ABL-transformed cells (19Tauchi T. Feng G.-S. Shen R. Song H.Y. Donner D. Pawson T. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15381-15387Google Scholar, 22Tauchi T. Boswell H.S. Leibowitz D. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 167-175Google Scholar). To examine the interactions of BCR-ABL, Grb2, and SHP-2, we utilized co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2 and then immunoblotted with anti-ABL (Fig. 4A). Not only 1-509 BCR/ABL and BCR/ABL p210, but also 1-63 BCR/ABL, which does not contain the Grb2 binding site, were co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2. However, 64-509 BCR/ABL mutant was not co-immunoprecipitated with Grb2 (Fig. 4A). Next, the cells were lysed and heat-denatured at 950C in the presence of SDS. The denatured lysates were incubated with GST-Grb2 fusion proteins and then immunoblotted with anti-ABL (Fig. 4B). Grb2 was not able to bind to 1-63 BCR/ABL and 64-509 BCR/ABL mutants, although Grb2 was still able to bind to BCR/ABL p210 in this condition (Fig. 4B). These results demonstrate that Grb2 interacts directly and indirectly with BCR-ABL. To investigate the conditions under SHP-2 physically interact with Grb2, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2, and these immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP-2 (Fig. 4C, left). SHP-2 could be detected in anti-Grb2 immunoprecipitates from 1-63 BCR/ABL, 1-509 BCR/ABL, and BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells but not from 64-509 BCR/ABL-expressing cells (Fig. 4C, left). In a similar experiment, Grb2 was detected in anti-SHP-2 immunoprecipitates from 1-63 BCR/ABL, 1-509 BCR/ABL, and BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells but not from 64-509 BCR/ABL-expressing cells (Fig. 4C, right). To obtain an overview of complexes formed in 1-63 BCR/ABL-expressing cells or in BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb2, and these immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 4D, left). Grb2 formed a specific complex with BCR/ABL and 70-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in 1-63 BCR/ABL and BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells (Fig. 4D, left). To test whether Grb2 can directly bind to SHP-2 and whether the 70-kDa Grb2-bound tyrosine-phosphorylated protein corresponds to SHP-2, protein complexes in the cell lysates were dissociated and denatured by 950C heat and SDS treatment prior to GST-Grb2 binding assays. The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP-2 (Fig. 4D, right). Grb2 was still able to bind to SHP-2, which corresponds to the 70-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, in 1-63 BCR/ABL and BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells (Fig. 4D, right). In addition to direct interaction of Grb2 and BCR-ABL shown in Fig. 4, A and B, these results suggest that Grb2 indirectly associates with BCR-ABL through SHP-2. Recent studies have shown that the SH3 domains of Grb2 directly bind to the proline-rich motifs of PI 3-kinase p85 subunit (26Wang J. Auger K.R. Jarvis L. Shi Y. Roberts T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12774-12780Google Scholar). Since Grb2 also associates with SHP-2 in BCR-ABL-transformed cells (Fig. 4C), we wished to evaluate possible interactions of SHP-2, Grb2, and PI 3-kinase. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) antibody, and these immune complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SHP-2 (Fig. 5A). SHP-2 could be detected in anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) immunoprecipitates from 1-63 BCR/ABL, 1-509 BCR/ABL, and BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells but not from 64-509 BCR/ABL-expressing cells (Fig. 5A). In a similar experiment, PI 3-kinase (p85) could be detected in anti-SHP-2 immunoprecipitates from 1-63 BCR/ABL, 1-509 BCR/ABL, and BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells but not from 64-509 BCR/ABL-expressing cells (Fig. 5B). These results demonstrate that SHP-2 and PI 3-kinase (p85) form physiological complexes in 1-63 BCR/ABL, 1-509 BCR/ABL, and BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells; however, this interaction was not observed in 64-509 BCR/ABL-expressing cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) and then immunoblotted with anti-Grb2 (Fig. 5C). Grb2 was detected in anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) immunoprecipitates from all cell lines (Fig. 5C). To test whether Grb2 directly binds to PI 3-kinase (p85) in BCR-ABL-expressing cells, cell lysates were dissociated and denatured by 950C heat and SDS treatment prior to GST-Grb2 binding assays, and these complexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-PI 3-kinase (p85) (Fig. 5D). Grb2 was still able to bind to PI 3-kinase (p85) in these conditions (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that Grb2 mediates the complex formations of SHP-2 and PI 3-kinase. SHP-2 is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in BCR-ABL-expressing cells except in the 64-509 BCR/ABL mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). It is possible that the association of SHP-2 with BCR-ABL would result in an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2. To test this hypothesis, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-ABL, and these immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated with GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins and [γ-32P]ATP. GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins were collected by glutathione-Sepharose beads and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 32P-labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography (Fig. 6A). As a control for equal recovery of GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins in this reaction, the same blot was immunoblotted with anti-GST mAb (Fig. 6B). GST-SHP-2 fusion proteins were phosphorylated in vitro in the cell lysates from 1-63 BCR/ABL, 1-509 BCR/ABL, and BCR/ABL p210-expressing cells but not from 64-509 BCR/ABL-expressing cells (Fig. 6A). These results demonstrate that BCR-ABL is the tyrosine kinase that phosphorylates SHP-2 in vitro. Activation of the tyrosine kinase and transforming functions of BCR-ABL is dependent upon the fused BCR sequences (27McWirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Google Scholar, 28Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau R.N. Littman D.R. Witte O.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1785-1792Google Scholar). The BCR sequences alter the subcellar localization of ABL. In BCR-ABL fusion proteins, the fused BCR sequences block nuclear translocation and activate the F-actin-binding function (14McWirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Google Scholar, 27McWirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Google Scholar). The F-actin-binding function is required for BCR-ABL to efficiently transform cells (14McWirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Google Scholar). A tetramerization domain has been identified in the BCR protein (11McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Google Scholar). This domain coincides within BCR domain 1 (amino acids 1-63) that is essential for transforming activity of BCR-ABL (11McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Google Scholar). Tetramerization of BCR-ABL correlates with activation of the tyrosine kinase and F-actin binding function of ABL (11McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Google Scholar). Deletion of the tetramerization domain inactivates the oligomerization function as well as the ability of BCR-ABL to transform rodent fibroblast or to abrogate interleukin-3 dependence in hematopoietic cells (11McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that in the BCR-ABL mutants deletion of the tetramerization domain of BCR did not allow induction of the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and the interactions of BCR-ABL, SHP-2, and Grb2. In vitro kinase assays have also shown that the tetramerization domain-deleted BCR-ABL mutant did not phosphorylate GST-SHP-2 in vitro. The tetramerization domain of BCR-ABL activates ABL by inducing intermolecular cross-phosphorylation of ABL tyrosine kinase (11McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Google Scholar). The resulting phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on BCR-ABL trigger the interactions of these SH2-containing signal transduction molecules (Figs. 3, 4, 5). Therefore, the tetramerization domain of BCR is essential for interactions of these downstream signaling molecules. Our identification of the specific amino acid residues involved in the biologically relevant association of BCR-ABL with SH2-containing signaling molecules suggests that this interaction may be a prime candidate for testing the therapeutic utility of peptides to disrupt the transformation capacity of BCR-ABL. Grb2 has been shown to bind tyrosine 177 within the first exon of BCR-ABL, and mutation of this residue abrogates the ability of BCR-ABL to transform fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells (12Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 175-185Google Scholar, 13Puil L. Liu J. Gish G. Mbamalu G. Bowtell D. Pelicci P.G. Arlinghaus R. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 764-773Google Scholar). In contrast to a report by others (12Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M.L. Cell. 1993; 75: 175-185Google Scholar), we established a growth factor-independent cell line which expressed a Grb2 binding site-deleted BCR-ABL mutant (1-64 BCR/ABL). Grb2 binding to BCR-ABL via tyrosine 177 is not required for the transformation of the interleukin-3-dependent cell line to growth factor-independent proliferation. We have also shown that Grb2 forms physiological complexes with the Grb2 binding site-deleted BCR-ABL (1-63 BCR/ABL) in vivo. These results allowed us to examine alternative pathways to Ras. SHP-2-Grb2 complexes are present in hematopoietic cells which express the Grb2 binding site-deleted BCR-ABL mutant (1-63 BCR/ABL). SHP-2 is able to bind directly to the 1-63 BCR/ABL mutant. These results suggest that Grb2 indirectly binds to BCR-ABL through SHP-2 and that there are multiple signaling pathways from BCR-ABL to Ras. SHP-2 may act as an alternative pathway from BCR-ABL to Ras. We thank Dr. J. Y. J. Wang (University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA) for the generous gifts of reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1989839515,"The tax gene product of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) transactivates interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene through activation of an enhancer termed CD28 responsive element (CD28RE). Tax activation of the CD28RE is partially mediated by a member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells, NF-AT1. We have previously shown that NF-AT1 is constitutively active in Jurkat T cells stably transfected with the Tax cDNA, although the underlying molecular mechanism and physiological relevance of this finding remain unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that the active form of NF-AT1 is also present in the nuclei of HTLV-I-transformed T cells that express the Tax protein. Interestingly, the constitutive activation of NF-AT1 in these T cells is associated with its dephosphorylation. Furthermore, the dephosphorylated NF-AT1 can be rapidly rephosphorylated when the cells are incubated with cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressant inhibiting the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. These results suggest that activation of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-transformed T cells results from its dephosphorylation, which in turn may be due to deregulation of calcineurin. The tax gene product of the type I human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) transactivates interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene through activation of an enhancer termed CD28 responsive element (CD28RE). Tax activation of the CD28RE is partially mediated by a member of the nuclear factor of activated T cells, NF-AT1. We have previously shown that NF-AT1 is constitutively active in Jurkat T cells stably transfected with the Tax cDNA, although the underlying molecular mechanism and physiological relevance of this finding remain unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that the active form of NF-AT1 is also present in the nuclei of HTLV-I-transformed T cells that express the Tax protein. Interestingly, the constitutive activation of NF-AT1 in these T cells is associated with its dephosphorylation. Furthermore, the dephosphorylated NF-AT1 can be rapidly rephosphorylated when the cells are incubated with cyclosporin A, an immunosuppressant inhibiting the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin. These results suggest that activation of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-transformed T cells results from its dephosphorylation, which in turn may be due to deregulation of calcineurin.

The HTLV-I genome encodes a 40-kDa protein, termed Tax, that has been shown to transcriptionally induce the expression of various cellular genes, such as the T-cell growth factor interleukin-2 (IL-2) and the α subunit of its high affinity receptor complex (IL-2Rα) (reviewed in 6Smith M.R.

The central role of these genes in normal T-cell activation and growth suggests that this specific action of Tax may be an important mechanism underlying HTLV-I-induced T-cell transformation (6Smith M.R.

Various immunological stimuli, as well as the HTLV-I Tax protein, induce the phosphorylation and subsequent proteolysis of IκBs, leading to the nuclear translocation of the active forms of NF-κB/Rel (for recent reviews, see Refs.21Thanos D.

In normal T cells, the NF-AT proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm as hyperphosphorylated inactive precursors (27McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E.

Treatment of T cells with stimuli of the T-cell receptor (TCR) complex or the calcium ionophore ionomycin results in the rapid dephosphorylation of NF-AT, which can be detected by its mobility change on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (32Ruff V.A.

The serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin appears to play an essential role in the activation of NF-AT, as the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A (CSA) and FK506 block the signal-induced dephosphorylation and the subsequent nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-AT (34Loh C. Carew J.A. Kim J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3945-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 36Shaw K.T.-Y. Ho A.M. Raghavan A. Kim J. Jain J. Park J. Sharma S. Rao A.

In further support of this notion, NF-AT has been shown to physically associate with calcineurin (35Shibasaki F. Price E.R. Milan D. Mckeon F.

For example, in human Jurkat leukemic T cells, a portion of NF-AT1 is constitutively localized in the nucleus even when the cells are incubated with CSA, although this nuclear form of NF-AT1 is inactive in DNA binding (33Park J. Yaseen N.R. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20653-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have recently shown that the DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 is constitutively activated in Jurkat T cells stably transfected with the HTLV-I Tax cDNA expression vector. This NF-AT member is one of the major factors binding to the IL-2 CD28RE and appears to play an important role in the activation of IL-2 promoter in these Tax-expressing cells (11Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that NF-AT1 is also constitutively activated in HTLV-I-infected human T cells. Furthermore, activation of NF-AT1 in these cells results from its dephosphorylation through a CSA-sensitive pathway. Human Jurkat leukemic T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mML-glutamine, and antibiotics. A Jurkat cell line stably transfected with a Tax cDNA expression vector (Jurkat-Tax, see 42Wano Y. Feinberg M. Hosking J. Bogerd H. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines C8166, HUT102, K3T, MT-2, and MT-4 cells, which had been characterized previously (43Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G.l. Kalyanaraman V.S.

Except for MT-4, all these cells express the Tax protein of HTLV-I. CSA was provided by Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Co. (East Hanover, NJ). The antibody against NF-AT1 was a gift from Dr. Anjana Rao (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; see 27McCaffrey P.G. Luo C. Kerppola T.K. Jain J. Badalian T.M. Ho A.M. Burgeon E. Lane W.S. Lambert J.N. Curran T. Verdine G.L. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Science. 1993; 262: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The antisera specific for various NF-κB/Rel components were kindly provided by Dr. Warner C. Greene (The Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, San Francisco, CA). The HTLV-I-infected T cells and noninfected parental Jurkat or Jurkat-Tax cells were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min. Subcellular and whole-cell extracts were prepared as described previously (47Good L. Sun S.-C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2730-2735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblotting analyses, protein samples (∼15 μg) were fractionated by 7.5% reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and then analyzed for immunoreactivity with anti-NF-AT1 using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; DuPont NEN). EMSA was performed by incubating the nuclear extracts (∼5 μg) with a 32P-radiolabeled CD28RE probe derived from the human IL-2 gene (AAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGT) followed by resolving the DNA-protein complexes on native 4% polyacrylamide gels (48Ballard D.W. Bohnlein E. Hoffman J. Bogerd H. Dixon E.P. Franza B.R. Greene W.C. New Biol. 1989; 1: 83-92PubMed Google Scholar). For antibody “supershift” assays, 1 μl of diluted antisera (5-fold for anti-NF-AT1, 3-fold for the various anti-NF-κB antisera) was added to the EMSA reaction 5 min before electrophoresis. To examine whether NF-AT1 is active in HTLV-I-infected T cells, EMSA was performed using a 32P-labeled human IL-2 CD28RE, and nuclear extracts were isolated from various HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines as well as Jurkat cells or Jurkat cells stably transfected with the tax cDNA (Jurkat-Tax) (Fig. 1). As shown previously (11Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), two major protein complexes, C1 and C2, were detected from the Jurkat-Tax cells (Fig. 1A, lane 2), while only low amounts of the C1 complex were found from the parental Jurkat cells (lane 1). Previous studies have shown that the intensity of the C1 complex varies in both the parental Jurkat cells and Jurkat-Tax cells; however, the C2 complex is detectable only in the Jurkat-Tax cells (11Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C2 complex, but not the C1 complex, has been shown to specifically immunoreact with an NF-AT1-specific antibody in antibody supershift assays, thus suggesting that NF-AT1 is involved in the formation of the inducible C2 complex (11Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the HTLV-I-infected cell lines (including C8166, HUT102, and K3T), two CD28RE-binding complexes were detected (lanes 3-5, C2 and C3), one of which (C2) comigrated with the NF-AT1 complex from the Jurkat-Tax cells (lane 2, C2), although all three cell lines lacked the C1 complex. In a separate experiment, the HTLV-I-infected MT-2 cells were also shown to express the C2 and C3 complexes (Fig. 1B, lane 2). However, another HTLV-I-infected cell line, MT-4, that was deficient in Tax expression (46Miyoshi I. Kubonishi I. Yoshimoto S. Akagi T. Ohtsuki Y. Shiraishi Y. Nagata K. Hinuma Y. Nature. 1981; 294: 770-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 49McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. Al-Murrani S.W. Green P.L. Ballard W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not express either C2 or C3 although it expressed high levels of the C1 complex (lane 3). To examine the proteins involved in the formation of these CD28RE-binding complexes, EMSA was performed using the C8166 cell extract in the presence of specific antibodies for various known IL-2 regulating transcription factors, including members of the NF-κB/Rel family and NF-AT1 (Fig. 1C). The antisera against the p50 (lane 3) and c-Rel (lane 4) subunits of NF-κB/Rel selectively supershifted the C3 complex, thus suggesting that this protein complex was composed of both p50 and c-Rel. The antisera for the RelA (lane 5), p52 (lane 6), and RelB (lane 7) subunits of NF-κB/Rel as well as a preimmune serum (lane 2) did not react with either C2 or C3. As expected, the C2 complex, which comigrated with the NF-AT1 complex in Jurkat-Tax cells (see Fig. 1A, C2), was supershifted by the anti-NF-AT1 antiserum (lane 8). The same result was obtained using the nuclear extracts isolated from HUT102, K3T, and MT2 cells (data not shown). Similar antibody supershift assays revealed that, as previously observed (11Good L. Maggirwar S.B. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3744-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), no immunoreactivity was found between the C1 complex in Jurkat or MT-4 and the anti-NF-AT1 antibody. Together, these results suggest that activation of NF-AT1 DNA binding activity in both Jurkat and HTLV-I-infected T cells is associated with the expression of the Tax protein. Additionally, the CD28RE is also bound by the p50/c-Rel heterodimer in HTLV-I-infected T cells. In Jurkat-Tax cells, which express significantly lower levels of NF-κB/Rel activity than in the HTLV-I-infected cells (50Sun S.-C. Elwood J. Béraud C. Greene W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7377-7384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the binding of NF-κB/Rel to CD28RE was very weak. However, the p50/c-Rel complex could be detected in these cells, especially when the EMSA conditions were modified to favor the binding of this NF-κB/Rel heterodimer (in the presence of about 60 mM NaCl, data not shown, also see Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Effect of CSA on the dephosphorylation and DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing cells.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3945-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To examine whether Tax-mediated activation of NF-AT1 also resulted from dephosphorylation of NF-AT1, immunoblotting studies were performed to analyze the phosphorylation state of NF-AT1 in Jurkat-Tax and the various HTLV-I-infected cells (Fig. 2). In the parental Jurkat cells, a single NF-AT1 protein band was detected, and, as previously reported (33Park J. Yaseen N.R. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Sharma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20653-20659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), this phosphorylated form of NF-AT1 was located in both cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 2), although the phosphorylated form of nuclear NF-AT1 was inactive in CD28RE binding (see Fig. 1A, lane 1). Interestingly, in Jurkat-Tax cells, a large amount of NF-AT1 was present in its more rapidly migrating dephosphorylated form and localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4, NF-AT1*). The dephosphorylated form of NF-AT1 was also detected from the Tax-expressing HTLV-I-infected HUT102 (Fig. 2B, lane 1), K3T (lane 2), MT2 (lane 3), and C8166 (data not shown) cells. However, in the MT-4 cells, which are deficient in Tax expression, the entire NF-AT1 protein pool was in the phosphorylated form (Fig. 2B, lane 4, NF-AT1). Thus, the DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 was well correlated with its dephosphorylation (compare Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The level of NF-AT1 dephosphorylation in the Tax-expressing T cells appeared to vary during different stages of cell culture, with fresh culture exhibiting higher levels (data not shown). However, no significant amount of the fast migrating dephosphorylated NF-AT1 was ever detected in the Tax-deficient Jurkat and MT4 cells (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Taken together with the results shown in Fig. 1, it suggests that activation of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-infected T cells likely results from its dephosphorylation. To explore the mechanism of NF-AT1 dephosphorylation and to further correlate the dephosphorylation and DNA binding activity of this transcription factor, the effect of CSA on the electrophoretic mobility and DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 was analyzed. For these studies, the HTLV-I-infected K3T cells (Fig. 3A) or Jurkat-Tax cells (Fig. 3B) were incubated with CSA and then subjected to immunoblot to analyze the expression of the different forms of NF-AT1 in both cytoplasm and nucleus. As shown in Fig. 3A, CSA treatment for as short as 5 min led to the disappearance of the dephosphorylated form of NF-AT1, which was associated with the increase of the phosphorylated form of NF-AT1 in both cytoplasm and nucleus (lanes 3 and 4). However, in contrast to that seen with immunologically stimulated murine T cells (34Loh C. Carew J.A. Kim J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3945-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the rephosphorylated NF-AT1 in these HTLV-I-transformed T cells did not relocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm even after 30 min of CSA treatment (Fig. 3A, lanes 3-8). Similar results were obtained from Jurkat-Tax cells (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, parallel EMSA revealed that the rephosphorylation of NF-AT1 was associated with the loss of its DNA binding activity in both the Jurkat-Tax (Fig. 3C) and K3T (data not shown) cells. Together, these results suggest that the constitutive DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 in Tax-expressing and HTLV-I-infected T cells apparently results from its dephosphorylation, which in turn is likely mediated by the CSA-sensitive phosphatase calcineurin. These studies also indicate that the nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of NF-AT1 may be differentially regulated in these Tax-expressing cells. Transcriptional activation of the IL-2 gene in normal T cells requires both the TCR-mediated primary and the CD28-mediated costimulatory signals. However, in T cells infected with HTLV-I or expressing the viral Tax protein, various pharmacological stimuli that mimic the TCR signaling are sufficient to induce the transcription of the IL-2 gene (12Himes S.R.

A. 1988; 85: 9733-9737Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), thus suggesting that Tax may provide a costimulatory signal for T-cell activation. Interestingly, the Tax-responsive element within the IL-2 promoter has been identified to be the CD28RE (9Li M. Siekevitz M. Mol. Cell.

The transcription factors involved in Tax-mediated activation of CD28RE remain unclear. Although NF-κB/Rel has been shown to bind to the CD28RE which may contribute to the activation of this enhancer (12Himes S.R. Katsikeros R. Shannon M.F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4001-4008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), additional factors are clearly required since a Tax mutant (M47) that is capable of NF-κB activation (53Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) fails to transactivate the CD28RE (10Curtiss V.E. Smilde R. McGuire K.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 16: 3567-3575Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2003) Google Scholar). In support of this notion, we have recently shown that NF-AT1 binds to the CD28RE in a Tax-expressing Jurkat cell line (Jurkat-Tax) and participates in the activation of CD28RE in a reporter gene assay. In the present study, we have demonstrated that NF-AT1 is constitutively activated in both Jurkat-Tax and various HTLV-I-infected T-cell lines expressing the viral Tax protein (Fig. 1). This finding strongly suggests that activation of NF-AT may be part of the mechanism by which HTLV-I activates human T cells. As seen with immunological stimuli (32Ruff V.A. Leach K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22602-22607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 34Loh C. Carew J.A. Kim J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell.

A. 1995; 92: 11205-11209Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), activation of NF-AT1 in the HTLV-I-infected T cells is associated with the dephosphorylation of this normally heavily phosphorylated protein (Fig. 2). However, the dephosphorylated form of NF-AT1 is constitutively expressed in the nucleus of these virally infected T cells, which is in contrast to the transient activation of NF-AT1 in antigen-stimulated noninfected T cells (34Loh C. Carew J.A. Kim J. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3945-3954Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This apparent deregulation of NF-AT1 can be due to either the up-regulation of calcineurin activity or down-regulation of the opposing NF-AT kinase activity. We think the former possibility is more likely true since the dephosphorylated NF-AT1 can be rapidly rephosphorylated when the cells are incubated with the calcineurin inhibitor CSA (Fig. 3), which suggests that the NF-AT kinase is still active in these cells. It is important to note, however, that the rephosphorylated NF-AT1 in CSA-treated cells is largely retained in the nucleus even though it becomes inactive in DNA binding (Fig. 3). Although the precise underlying mechanism remains to be further investigated, it is possible that the nuclear form of NF-AT1 seen in the CSA-treated HTLV-I-transformed cells is not fully rephosphorylated. In support of this notion, the nuclear form of NF-AT1 appears to migrate slightly faster than the cytoplasmic form (see Fig. 3). Studies are in progress to directly analyze the phosphorylation state of the two different forms of NF-AT1."

Here we show that overexpression of Brn-3b can reduce process outgrowth and synaptic vesicle gene expression following exposure to a stimulus which would normally induce differentiation. These inhibitory effects are abolished by altering a single amino acid in the POU homeodomain of Brn-3b to its equivalent in Brn-3a. The converse mutation in Brn-3a allows it to inhibit process outgrowth in response to a differentiation-inducing stimulus.

Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 881-889Google Scholar), the levels of Brn-3a rise dramatically, and those of Brn-3b fall (3Lillycrop K.A. Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Lakin N.D. Terrenghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Google Scholar, 15Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Google Scholar), while Brn-3c levels remain unchanged. 2D. S. Latchman, unpublished data. This differentiation process is likely to require the induction of specific genes involved in the outgrowth of neurite processes and the acquisition of a more neuronal-like phenotype. If such genes were targets for activation by Brn-3a and repression by Brn-3b, the changes in Brn-3 expression could potentially play a key role in the differentiation process by activating the expression of such genes. Hence the ND7 cell system offers a convenient model system for studying the role of the Brn-3 factors in neuronal differentiation. Indeed we have previously used this system to show that the inhibition of Brn-3a expression using an antisense approach prevents the neurite outgrowth and elevated expression of SNAP-25, which normally occur following exposure of ND7 cells to a differentiation inducing stimulus (14Lakin N.D. Morris P.J. Theil T. Sato T.N. Moroy T. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15858-15863Google Scholar). Moreover, the stable overexpression of Brn-3a in ND7 cell clones resulted in neurite outgrowth and the induction of several synaptic proteins including SNAP-25 even in the absence of a differentiation inducing stimulus (19Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Given the ability of Brn-3a to induce the SNAP-25 promoter in co-transfection experiments (14Lakin N.D. Morris P.J. Theil T. Sato T.N. Moroy T. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15858-15863Google Scholar), it is therefore likely that the rise in Brn-3a, which occurs during ND7 cell differentiation, directly activates the SNAP-25 promoter and is thus responsible for the rise in SNAP-25 expression, which occurs during the differentiation event. Moreover, the finding that SNAP-25 expression is essential for neurite outgrowth in several different types of neuronal cells in vitro and in vivo (20Osen-Sand A. Catsicas M. Staple J.K. Jones K.A. Ayala G. Knowles J. Grenningloh G. Catsicas S. Nature. 1993; 364: 445-448Google Scholar) indicates that the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles, which is required for synaptic transmission, and the constitutive exocytosis, which is required for axon outgrowth, may have several components such as SNAP-25 in common. Hence, the induction by Brn-3a of SNAP-25 gene expression and that of other synaptic proteins is likely to be responsible, at least in part, for its ability to induce neurite outgrowth. Although these findings indicate a critical role for the rise in Brn-3a expression in inducing neuronal differentiation in ND7 cells, they also focus attention on the role of Brn-3b. Thus the levels of Brn-3b fall dramatically during ND7 cell differentiation (3Lillycrop K.A. Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Lakin N.D. Terrenghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Google Scholar), while in co-transfection experiments it both represses the basal activity of a number of different promoters, which are activated by Brn-3a, and prevents their activation by Brn-3a (13Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Theil T. Ching G.Y. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Liem R.K.H. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2853-2858Google Scholar, 15Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Theil T. Morris P.J.

We have therefore investigated the response of ND7 cell clones overexpressing Brn-3b to a stimulus which would normally induce differentiation and have compared this to the response of clones overexpressing either Brn-3a or Brn-3c. cDNA clones of wild type and mutant forms of Brn-3a, Brn-3b, and Brn-3c, as well as the POU domains of Brn-3a and Brn-3b, were inserted in the sense orientation under the control of the dexamethasone-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter of the mammalian expression vector PJ5 (21Morgenstern J.P. Land H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1068Google Scholar). Following co-transfection into ND7 cells (17Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1990; 241: 187-194Google Scholar) together with a plasmid conferring neomycin resistance (pM5G-NEO), stable transfectants were selected by the supplementation of culture medium with G418 to a final concentration of 800 μg/ml, and individual clones were isolated after 7-14 days of selection. Putative clones were treated with dexamethasone at a final concentration of 1 μM for 24 h to induce expression of the MMTV promoter to allow screening for clones capable of expressing the exogenous construct. RNA was isolated from cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate method (22Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar), treated with DNase to remove any contaminating DNA, and subsequently used as the template for cDNA synthesis. Resultant cDNA was amplified by PCR essentially as described by Kawasaki (23Kawasaki E.S. Innis M.A. Gelfard D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1990: 21-27Google Scholar). In initial screening experiments to confirm that exogenous constructs were producing sense mRNAs in the cell lines, PCR was performed using a forward primer internal to the POU domain (Brn-3a, 5ʹ-GACTCGGACACGGACCCCGCG-3ʹ; Brn-3b, 5ʹ-GACGTGGATGCAGACCCGCGG-3ʹ; Brn-3c, 5ʹ-GATGTGGAGTCAGACCCTCGA-3ʹ) and a reverse primer internal to the vector sequence (5ʹ-AGATCTGGTACCATCGAT-3ʹ) so as not to amplify endogenous Brn-3mRNA, with product detected by Southern hybridization with homologous probes. cDNA from clones capable of expressing the exogenous construct were subsequently subjected to PCR to determine the total level of expression of that member of the Brn-3 family by using forward and reverse primers internal to the POU domain thus amplifying both exogenous and endogenous mRNAs (Forward primers as above. Reverse primers: Brn-3a, 5ʹ-CCCTCCTCAGTAAGTGGC-3ʹ; Brn-3b, 5ʹ-CTAAATGCCGGCAGAGTATTTCAC-3ʹ; Brn-3c, 5ʹ-CAATCGTCCACAGCAGAGTATTT-3ʹ). Sample pairs were equalized using primers designed to amplify the mRNA species encoding the invariant L6 ribosomal protein (5ʹ-ATCGCTCCTCAAACTTGACC-3ʹ and 5ʹ-AACTACAACCACCTCATGAA-3ʹ). In all cases expression was studied in the presence or absence of dexamethasone in cells either proliferating in full serum-containing medium or induced to differentiate by growth in serum-free medium. In all cases cultures differentiated in the absence of dexamethasone were analyzed in parallel with dexamethasone-induced experimental differentiated cultures, and both subsequently compared to lines expressing the PJ5 vector with an empty expression cassette induced to differentiate in the presence or absence of dexamethasone. To determine neurite process length cells were subject to immunocytochemistry using a primary monoclonal antibody to α-tubulin detected by the peroxidase/diaminobenzidene color reaction. The length of the longest process in each of 400 cells was determined for each sample using video capture NIH Image software (version 1.59) with the operator unaware of the nature of the sample. Statistical analysis was performed using Microstat software to compare the means of triplicate determinations. In all cases the paired t test was used to compare different cell lines either before or after steroid treatment while the Mann Whitney test was used to compare data in a single set of cell lines before and after steroid treatment. cDNAs were first subject to PCR designed to amplify the mRNA species encoding the L6 ribosomal proteins (see above). Following subsequent Southern hybridization to allow the equalization of cDNA input between both uninduced and induced control and experimental samples, PCR amplification using primers to specifically amplify the mRNA species encoding SNAP25 (5ʹ-TGACCAGCTGGCTGATGAGTC-3ʹ and 5ʹ-CCCATGTCTAGGGGGCCATATGA-3ʹ) and GAP43 (5ʹ-GTGCTCTGGTTTCCTTAGCA-3ʹ and 5ʹ-GATATAGCCCTCATCCATCA-3ʹ) was performed. Similar amplifications were also performed, using primers designed to specifically amplify synapsin Ia (5ʹ-ATGGAGACTACCGCAGTTTG-3ʹ and 5ʹ-CACAACTACAGGGTATGTTG-3), synaptotagmin I (5ʹ-TCGCCCATGGCTGTGGTTGCT-3ʹ and 5ʹ-CTGGAAATCATAGTCCAGAG-3ʹ) and synaptophysin I (5ʹ-CAGAAACAAGTACCGAGAA-3ʹ and 5ʹ-CCAAACACCACTGAGGTGTT-3ʹ). All amplifications were carried out using levels of mRNA and numbers of cycles, which had been shown in previous control experiments to give levels of product that were linearly related to the amount of input RNA (data not shown). Following amplification, products were run on agarose gels and hybridized with appropriate probes for each amplification product. The cell doubling rate of experiment and control cultures in serum-free medium was determined, allowing the construction of growth curves, while the S-phase proliferative fraction of each culture was determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation and subsequent immunocytochmical detection using a BrdUrd labeling and detection kit (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The number of positive nuclei in a population of 500 cells per sample was determined for the purpose of statistical analysis. When ND7 cells are induced to differentiate by removal of serum, the level of Brn-3a rises and that of Brn-3b falls (Fig. 1a). To test the effect of Brn-3b on the differentiation of ND7 cells we used cell lines prepared by stably transfecting ND7 cell lines with cDNA clones for Brn-3a, Brn-3b or Brn-3c under the control of the dexamethasone inducible MMTV promoter, allowing us to regulate the level of Brn-3 in each cell line by steroid treatment. Three cell lines of each type selected on the basis of their neomycin resistance (encoded on a co-transfected plasmid) were used to control for clonal variation. Each showed basal and steroid inducible expression of the appropriate transfected form of Brn-3 in cells proliferating in full-serum containing medium as assayed by PCR using one primer specific for the RNA transcript derived from a transfected plasmid and one primer specific for the appropriate form of Brn-3 (Fig. 1b). Similarly increased basal levels and steroid inducibility of each form of Brn-3 in the proliferating cells could be demonstrated by PCR using primers which would specifically amplify both the endogenous and exogenous mRNAs encoding each form of Brn-3 (Fig. 1b). Most importantly the levels of the exogenous Brn-3 in each cell line were unaffected by the induction of cell differentiation by removal of serum. Thus the fall in endogenous Brn-3b that occurs in these circumstances (see Fig. 1a) in all the cells resulted in the Brn-3b-transfected cells having a much higher level of Brn-3b than control cells following exposure to a differentiation-inducing stimulus (Fig. 1b). Moreover, the differentiated Brn-3a-transfected cells still maintained a higher total level of Brn-3a than control cells (Fig. 1b) despite the rise in endogenous Brn-3a levels that occurs upon differentiation (see Fig. 1a) (3Lillycrop K.A.

Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Google Scholar). Similarly, enhanced levels of Brn-3c were also observed in the Brn-3c transfected cells (Fig. 1b). We therefore investigated the effect of Brn-3a, Brn-3b, or Brn-3c over expression on the outgrowth of neurites which normally occurs following removal of serum from the ND7 cells (18Suburo A.M. Wheatley S.C. Horn D.A. Gibson S.J. Jahn R. Fischer-Colbrie R. Wood J.W. Latchman D.S. Polak J.M. Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 881-889Google Scholar). Cells were induced to differentiate by removal of serum and the effect of each form of Brn-3 assessed. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table I the Brn-3a- and Brn-3c-expressing cell lines exhibited enhanced neurite length compared to control cells following the induction of differentiation and exposure to steroid treatment to fully induce expression of Brn-3a or Brn-3c (p < 0.05 for Brn-3a or Brn-3c cell lines compared to vector, in a paired t test). This extends our previous conclusion (19Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar) that Brn-3a and to a lesser extent Brn-3c can induce neurite outgrowth even in full serum-containing medium and indicates that exogenous Brn-3a can enhance outgrowth even in the presence of the enhanced levels of endogenous Brn-3a produced by the differentiation-inducing stimulus.Table INeurite length in cell lines expressing different forms of Brn-3Brn-3 isoformAverage neurite length when differentiated in the absence of dexamethasoneAverage neurite length when differentiated in the presence of dexamethasoneμmControl vector55 ± 958.6 ± 13Brn-3a62 ± 1072.7 ± 15Brn-3b46 ± 236 ± 11Brn-3c49 ± 1371 ± 9 Open table in a new tab In contrast however, all three Brn-3b-expressing cell lines showed decreased levels of neurite outgrowth compared to control cells following induction of differentiation even without steroid treatment (Fig. 2 and Table I, p < 0.001 in a paired t test). Following steroid treatment, these cells showed a further reduction in neurite length which was significant both in comparison to the neurite length observed in these cells in the absence of steroid treatment (p < 0.01 in a Mann Whitney test) and by comparison to the neurite length in similarly treated control cells (p < 0.01 in a paired t test) (Fig. 2b and Table I). This resulted in these processes being considerably shorter than those formed by control cells transfected with the pJ5 vector without any insert or those transfected with Brn-3a or Brn-3c. Hence the overexpression of Brn-3b can indeed interfere with neurite outgrowth following exposure of ND7 cells to a differentiation inducing stimulus. Interestingly overexpression of Brn-3a, Brn-3b, or Brn-3c had no effect on the numbers of cells bearing processes (Fig. 2c) indicating that Brn-3b acts by inhibiting the extension of the processes rather than their initial formation. In the case of Brn-3a, this effect is in contrast to its ability to enhance the number of processes formed in the absence of a differentiation inducing stimulus. This indicates that the rise in endogenous Brn-3a levels which occurs upon differentiation is sufficient for maximal numbers of processes to form so that further overexpression of Brn-3a enhances only the length of the processes which form (14Lakin N.D. Morris P.J. Theil T. Sato T.N. Moroy T. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15858-15863Google Scholar, 19Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). When ND7 cells are differentiated by transfer to serum-free medium, process outgrowth is accompanied by a cessation of cell division (17Wood J.N. Bevan S.J. Coote P. Darn P.M. Hogan P. Latchman D.S. Morrison C. Rougon G. Theveniau M. Wheatley S.C. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B. 1990; 241: 187-194Google Scholar, 18Suburo A.M. Wheatley S.C. Horn D.A. Gibson S.J. Jahn R. Fischer-Colbrie R. Wood J.W. Latchman D.S. Polak J.M. Neuroscience. 1992; 46: 881-889Google Scholar), although this latter effect is not observed in Brn-3a-overexpressing cells growing in serum-containing medium (19Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of overexpressing each of the forms of Brn-3 upon the growth arrest normally caused by serum removal. No significant alteration in either the growth rate (Fig. 3a) or in the proportion of cells in S phase as assayed by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (Fig. 3b) was observed in differentiated cells overexpressing Brn-3b. Thus, like overexpression of Brn-3a in undifferentiated cells, the overexpression of Brn-3b in differentiated cells has a much larger effect on neurite outgrowth than upon growth rate. We have shown that the induction of differentiation by Brn-3a is accompanied by the enhanced expression of four components of the synaptic vesicle cycle SNAP-25, synapsin I, synaptophysin, and synaptotagmin each of which plays a distinct role in different stages of the cycle (for review, see 24Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-6535Google Scholar and 25Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Neuron. 1991; 6: 665-677Google Scholar). Similarly, differentiation of ND7 cells by serum removal results in enhanced expression of these proteins (Fig. 4a). We therefore measured the expression of the mRNAs encoding each of these proteins when the ND7 cell lines expressing each of the forms of Brn-3 were induced to differentiate. As shown in Fig. 4b, the Brn-3b-expressing cells showed reduced levels of SNAP-25, synaptotagmin and synaptophysin mRNAs following differentiation and steroid induction of Brn-3b expression, compared to the levels in similarly treated cells transfected with vector or Brn-3a (Fig. 4b). This was confirmed by statistical analysis of quantitative data on mRNA levels obtained by densitometric scanning of the autoradiographs (p < 0.05 comparing mRNA levels in the Brn-3b cells following differentiation and steroid induction with that in similarly treated control cells). Thus Brn-3b overexpression can indeed inhibit some of the genes normally induced during Brn-3a-induced differentiation. However, the levels of synapsin I mRNA were elevated in the differentiated Brn-3b-expressing cells compared to the control cells (Fig. 4b). This elevation in synapsin I expression is consistent with our recent co-transfection experiments which identified the synapsin I promoter as the first promoter that is inducible by all three forms of Brn-3 (26Morris P.J. Lakin D.D. Dawson S.J. Ryabanin A.E. Kilimann M.W. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). As expected no change in GAP43 expression was noted in the Brn-3b-expressing cells (Fig. 4b), paralleling our previous findings that neither Brn-3a or Brn-3b alter the level of this protein in undifferentiated ND7 cells or regulate its promoter in co-transfections (19Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Hence as well as reducing the length of neurite processes, which form upon differentiation, Brn-3b can also inhibit some but not all of the changes in gene expression that occur during this process. In previous experiments, using chimeric proteins containing different regions of Brn-3a or Brn-3b, we have shown that the POU domain plays a key role in the different effects of these factors on target promoters in co-transfection assays (15Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Google Scholar, 16Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Google Scholar). Thus, although the POU domain of both factors can bind to DNA (5Theil T. McLean-Hunter S. Zornig M. Möröy T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5921-5929Google Scholar, 27Dawson S.J. Liu Y-Z. Rodel B. Moroy T. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 439-443Google Scholar), only the isolated POU domain of Brn-3a can activate the tk-Oct promoter (13Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Theil T. Ching G.Y. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Liem R.K.H. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2853-2858Google Scholar), whereas the POU domain of Brn-3b cannot do so. Hence as well as acting as the DNA binding domain, the POU domain of Brn-3a can also act as a distinct activation domain. We therefore prepared ND7 cell lines overexpressing the isolated POU domain of Brn-3a or Brn-3b and tested their effect on neurite outgrowth. As shown in Fig. 5 the differentiated cells expressing the Brn-3a POU domain showed a similar enhancement of neurite length compared to control cells as did those expressing full-length Brn-3a (p < 0.05 in a paired t test comparing Brn-3a POU domain cells with controls). Moreover, the differentiated cells expressing the POU domain of Brn-3b showed a similar steroid inducible reduction in neurite length as occurred in cells expressing full-length Brn-3b (p < 0.01 in a paired t test comparing Brn-3b POU domain cells with controls). As expected no effects on the number of processes formed were observed in the cells overexpressing the POU domain paralleling the lack of effect of the full-length factors in differentiated cells (Fig. 6).Fig. 6Effect of overexpressing the indicated form of Brn-3 on the proportion of cells with processes when grown in serum-free medium. Shaded bars, uninduced; solid bars, induced. Values are the average of two independent experiments each analyzed in duplicate and compared to the level in cells transfected with pJ5 vector alone. Data of three independent clones expressing each construct have been combined. The error bars show the standard deviation of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Interestingly, as well as affecting neurite length in a similar fashion to the full-length protein, the POU domains also either enhanced (Brn-3a) or reduced (Brn-3b) the expression of SNAP-25 in a manner similar to that observed in differentiated cells overexpressing the full-length protein (Fig. 7). Hence the Brn-3b POU domain appears to be able to inhibit process outgrowth and SNAP-25 expression, whereas the Brn-3a POU domain has the opposite effect. This indicates that one or more of the seven amino acid differences between the POU domains of Brn-3a and Brn-3b (3Lillycrop K.A. Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Lakin N.D. Terrenghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Google Scholar, 16Morris P.J. Theil T. Ring C.J.A. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Google Scholar) plays a critical role in this effect. Six of these differences are in the relatively nonconserved linker region joining the POU-specific and POU homeodomains, which together make up the POU domain (7Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.-L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Google Scholar, 8Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Current Opin. Dev. Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Google Scholar). We have therefore focused our attention on the single difference in the POU homeodomain at position 22 and have shown that this plays a critical role in the different effects of Brn-3a and Brn-3b on a target promoter in co-transfection assays. Thus alteration of the isoleucine at this position in Brn-3b to the valine found in Brn-3a allows the mutant Brn-3b to activate the tk-Oct promoter (28Dawson S.J. Morris P.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11631-11633Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of overexpressing mutant forms of full-length Brn-3a or Brn-3b in which the amino acid at this position has been mutated to its equivalent in the other factor. In these experiments, mutant Brn-3b with valine instead of isoleucine at this position failed to inhibit neurite outgrowth (Fig. 5) in the differentiated cells compared to the levels observed in control differentiated cells. Hence the mutation of a single amino acid in Brn-3b results in its losing the ability to inhibit neurite outgrowth (p < 0.05 for Brn-3b valine compared to wild type Brn-3b in a paired t test). Similarly, the mutant Brn-3b also failed to inhibit SNAP-25 expression in the differentiated cells (Fig. 7). Moreover, cells expressing Brn-3a with isoleucine instead of valine at position 22 showed a much smaller enhancement of SNAP-25 expression than did cells expressing intact Brn-3a (Fig. 7). More dramatically, these cells not only failed to show the enhancement of process formation characteristic of Brn-3a but actually showed a steroid-inducible reduction in process formation compared to control differentiated cells which was almost as large as that observed in cells expressing Brn-3b (Fig. 5). Thus the mutant Brn-3a isoleucine shows a dramatically different effect on neurite outgrowth compared to wild type Brn-3a (p < 0.01 for Brn-3a isoleucine compared to Brn-3a in a paired t test). Hence alterations at a single amino acid can dramatically affect the ability of Brn-3a or Brn-3b to regulate ND7 cell differentiation. Our previous studies (14Lakin N.D. Morris P.J. Theil T. Sato T.N. Moroy T. Wilson M.C. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15858-15863Google Scholar, 19Smith M.D. Dawson S.J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar) have shown that the overexpression of Brn-3a can enhance both the number and length of neurite processes, which form in ND7 cells under conditions that do not normally promote differentiation, and can also activate the expression of several genes encoding proteins involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle. The differentiation process in ND7 cells, however, normally involves both a rise in the level of Brn-3a and a fall in the level of Brn-3b (3Lillycrop K.A. Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Lakin N.D. Terrenghi G. Wood J.N. Polak J.M. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5093-5096Google Scholar, 15Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Theil T. Morris P.J. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Latchman D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3092-3098Google Scholar). In the experiments reported here we have investigated the role of Brn-3b in this process and have shown that, under conditions which normally promote differentiation, overexpression of Brn-3b can reduce the length of the neurites that form and reduce the expression of some but not all of the genes that are activated during Brn-3a-induced differentiation. These findings indicate therefore that regulation of ND7 cell differentiation involves a balance between the differentiation-inducing factor Brn-3a and the inhibitory factor Brn-3b. As Brn-3a and Brn-3b are expressed in distinct but overlapping patterns in the developing and adult nervous system (1Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Tuner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V.

Mech. Dev. 1996; 53: 291-304Google Scholar), it is possible that they play a similar role in regulating neurite outgrowth during development and in response to nerve injury in the adult. Although further studies will be required to confirm this possibility, our findings clearly establish Brn-3b as the first transcription factor to have an inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth. Our recent identification of the gene encoding the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α2 subunit as the first example of a gene whose promoter is activated by Brn-3b and not Brn-3a (29Milton N.G.N. Bessis A. Changeux J.P. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15143-15147Google Scholar, 30Milton N.G.N. Bessis A. Changeux J-P. Latchman D.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 419-423Google Scholar) raises the possibility that Brn-3b might inhibit neurite outgrowth by activating the expression of other genes whose products play a directly inhibitory role in outgrowth. However, it is more likely that the inhibitory effect of Brn-3b is brought about by its ability to repress the activity of specific genes. Thus in co-transfection experiments we have previously shown that Brn-3b can repress the basal activity of several different promoters, which are inducible by Brn-3a, and can also interfere with their activation by Brn-3a (13Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Morris P.J. Lakin N.D. Theil T. Ching G.Y. Lillycrop K.A. Möröy T. Liem R.K.H. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2853-2858Google Scholar, 15Budhram-Mahadeo V.S. Theil T. Morris P.J.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6907-6914Google Scholar). Moreover, in the experiments reported here the inhibition of neurite outgrowth was accompanied by a reduction in SNAP-25, synaptophysin, and synaptotagmin expression in the Brn-3b-overexpressing cells. The ability of Brn-3b to prevent the rise in SNAP-25 expression which normally occurs during ND7 cell differentiation is of particular interest since this presynaptic vesicle protein (31Oyler G.A. Higgins G.A. Hart R.A. Battenberg E. Billinsley M. Bloom F.E. Wilson M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3039-3052Google Scholar) has itself been shown to be necessary for process formation by different neuronal cell types both in vitro and in vivo (20Osen-Sand A. Catsicas M. Staple J.K. Jones K.A. Ayala G. Knowles J. Grenningloh G. Catsicas S. Nature. 1993; 364: 445-448Google Scholar). It is likely therefore that the ability to inhibit the expression of SNAP-25 and potentially of other genes whose protein products are involved in the process of neurite outgrowth underlies the inhibitory effect of Brn-3b on process formation. This association of the inhibitory effect of Brn-3b on specific gene expression and on neurite outgrowth is further supported by the critical role of the amino acid at position 22 in the homeodomain in this process. Thus alteration of the isoleucine at this position to the valine in Brn-3b prevents the inhibitory effect of Brn-3b not only on a co-transfected promoter (28Dawson S.J. Morris P.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11631-11633Google Scholar) but also, as shown here, on endogenous SNAP-25 expression and on neurite outgrowth. Moreover, the reciprocal substitution in Brn-3a not only abolishes its ability to enhance neurite outgrowth but actually allows it to inhibit neurite outgrowth during differentiation. We previously suggested (28Dawson S.J. Morris P.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11631-11633Google Scholar) that Brn-3b may inhibit Brn-3a-induced genes simply by binding to the DNA and being unable to activate transcription. It would therefore passively inhibit gene expression by preventing Brn-3a from binding to the DNA. In this model position 22 in the homeodomain which is known to have no effect on DNA binding (28Dawson S.J. Morris P.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11631-11633Google Scholar) would be involved in allowing Brn-3a to act as an activator perhaps by allowing Brn-3a to recruit a second activating factor (for further discussion, see Dawson et al. (28Dawson S.J. Morris P.J. Latchman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11631-11633Google Scholar)), while Brn-3b could not do so. However, the finding that mutation of this position in Brn-3a allows it to actually inhibit neurite outgrowth suggests that Brn-3b (and the mutant Brn-3a) may actually act as an active repressor by interacting with wild type Brn-3a or the basal transcriptional complex (for discussion of the mechanisms of transcriptional repression see 32Latchman D.S. Eukaryotic Transcription Factors. Ed. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995Google Scholar and 33Latchman D.S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 965-974Google Scholar). In this case isoleucine at this position would allow this inhibitory interaction to occur, whereas valine would not do so. Whatever the precise mechanism of this effect, however, it is already clear that Brn-3b is the first example of a transcription factor which can inhibit neurite outgrowth. The further analysis of this factor and its interaction with Brn-3a should greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanisms that regulate neurite outgrowth in development and may potentially have therapeutic implications for the treatment of human spinal injury when nerve regeneration is very poor.

https://openalex.org/W2025343168,"It has been suggested that electrostatic interactions are critical for binding of retinoic acid by cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABP-I and CRABP-II). However, the roles of two conserved arginine residues (Arg-111 and Arg-131 in CRABP-I; Arg-111 and Arg-132 in CRABP-II) that interact with the carboxyl group of retinoic acid have not been evaluated. A novel competitive binding assay has been developed for measuring the relative dissociation constants of the site-directed mutants of CRABPs. Arg-111 and Arg-132 of CRABP-II were replaced with methionine by site-directed mutagenesis. The relative dissociation constants of R111M and R132M (Kd(R111M)/Kd(CRABP-II) and Kd(R132M)/Kd(CRABP-II)) were determined to be 40-45 and 6-8, respectively. The ring protons of the aromatic residues of the wild-type CRABP-II and the two mutants were sequentially assigned by two-dimensional homonuclear NMR in conjunction with three-dimensional heteronuclear NMR. Detailed analysis of the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra of the proteins indicated that the conformations of the two mutants are highly similar to that of the wild-type CRABP-II. These results taken together showed that Arg-111 and Arg-132 are important for binding retinoic acid but contribute to the binding energy only by ∼2.2 and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. In addition, the relative dissociation constant of CRABP-II and CRABP-I (Kd(CRABP-II)/Kd(CRABP-I)) was determined to be 2-3, in close agreement with that calculated using the apparent Kd values determined under the same conditions by fluorometric titrations."
https://openalex.org/W2047655476,"We have recently shown that the immunomodulatory substance phosphorylcholine (PC) is covalently attached to ES-62, a major secreted protein of the filarial nematode parasite Acanthocheilonema viteae, via an N-linked glycan. Linkage of PC to N-glycans is previously unreported, and hence we have investigated the biochemical events underlying it. PC addition was found by pulse-chase experiments to be a fairly early event during intracellular transport, occurring within 40-60 min of protein synthesis. Biosynthetic labeling/immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that addition of PC to ES-62 was blocked by (i) brefeldin A, an inhibitor of trafficking of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, (ii) 1-deoxynorijirimycin, an inhibitor of glucosidase activity in the ER, and (iii) 1-deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of mannosidase I in the cis Golgi. Swainsonine, an inhibitor of mannosidase II in the medial Golgi, did not affect PC addition. Taken together these data indicate that PC attachment is a post-ER event which is dependent on generation of an appropriate substrate during oligosaccharide processing. Furthermore, they strongly suggest that PC addition takes place in the medial Golgi and that the substrate for addition is the 3-linked branch of Man5GlcNAc3 or Man3GLcNAc3.

Biosynthetic labeling/immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that addition of PC to ES-62 was blocked by (i) brefeldin A, an inhibitor of trafficking of newly synthesized proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi, (ii) 1-deoxynorijirimycin, an inhibitor of glucosidase activity in the ER, and (iii) 1-deoxymannojirimycin, an inhibitor of mannosidase I in the cis Golgi. Swainsonine, an inhibitor of mannosidase II in the medial Golgi, did not affect PC addition. Taken together these data indicate that PC attachment is a post-ER event which is dependent on generation of an appropriate substrate during oligosaccharide processing. Furthermore, they strongly suggest that PC addition takes place in the medial Golgi and that the substrate for addition is the 3-linked branch of Man5GlcNAc3 or Man3GLcNAc3. Filarial nematodes are arthropod-transmitted parasites of vertebrates. Of the eight species that infect humans, three, Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Onchocerca volvulus, are of major medical importance. The former two parasites inhabit the lymphatics, where they are associated with a number of pathological conditions, the most important of which is elephantiasis. O. volvulus resides in subcutaneous tissues, where it is relatively benign. However, larval forms (microfilariae) released by adult female worms migrate continuously through the skin and may cause chronic debilitating lesions. Furthermore, the microfilariae may invade the eye, invoking a number of pathological changes, and ultimately causing blindness. It is currently estimated that there are almost 150 million people infected with these parasites in the tropics, and a further 1,000 million at risk (1Walgate R. Simpson K. World Health Organization.in: Tropical Disease Research, Progress 1991-92. World Health Organization, Geneva1993: 37-46Google Scholar). Filarial nematodes release a number of proteins into their environment. A rather unusual characteristic of many of these proteins is that they contain phosphorylcholine (PC) 1The abbreviations used are: PCphosphorylcholinedNM1-deoxynorijirimycinERendoplasmic reticulumdMM1-deoxymannojirimycinPBSphosphate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. in apparent covalent association (reviewed in 2Harnett W. Parkhouse R.M.E. Sood M.L. Perspectives in Nematode Physiology and Biochemistry. M/S Narendra Publication House, New Delhi1995: 207-242Google Scholar). The function of this PC on secreted proteins has yet to be unequivocally established, but it is likely that it plays a role in interfering with the ability of the host immune system to respond to the worm. It has recently been shown, for example, that PC-containing antigens of B. malayi can inhibit phytohemagglutinin-induced proliferation of human T-cells (3Lal R.B. Kumaraswami V. Steel C. Nutman T.B. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1990; 42: 56-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and ES-62, a major PC-containing secreted protein of the rodent filarial parasite Acanthocheilonema viteae (4Harnett W. Worms M.J. Kapil A. Grainger M. Parkhouse R.M.E. Parasitology. 1989; 99: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), is able to inhibit polyclonal murine B-cell proliferation induced by ligation of the antigen receptors (5Harnett W. Harnett M.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4829-4837PubMed Google Scholar). In both cases, the observed effect is confirmed as being due to PC, as it can be mimicked by PC bound to bovine serum albumin. phosphorylcholine 1-deoxynorijirimycin endoplasmic reticulum 1-deoxymannojirimycin phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PC is also found on a number of nonsecreted proteins of filarial nematodes, where its function is unknown. It appears to be particularly abundant within the uterus and digestive tract (6Forsyth K.P. Copeman D.B. Mitchell G.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1984; 58: 41-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), but the significance of this is uncertain. PC is a component of teichoic acids in the cell wall (7Brundish D.E. Baddiley J. Biochem. J. 1968; 110: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and lipoteichoic acids in the cell membrane (8Briles E.B. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 335-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of certain species of Gram-positive bacteria, where it appears to play a crucial role in the maintenance of normal cell shape and physiology (9Horne D.S. Tomasz A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether related roles exist with respect to filarial nematodes remains to be established. Certainly, the mechanism of attachment of PC is similar in both groups of organisms, in that it involves linkage to carbohydrate (10Bennet L.G. Bishop C.T. Can. J. Chem. 1977; 55: 8-16Crossref Google Scholar, 11Harnett W. Houston K.M. Amess R. Worms M.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The same appears to be true of PC found in fungi (12Unkefer C.J. Gander J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 685-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have observed that attachment of PC to ES-62 is via a glycan of the N-type. This conclusion is based on the findings that PC and glycan groups are both lost following exposure of ES-62 to N-glycosidase F (11Harnett W. Houston K.M. Amess R. Worms M.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and absent following culture of A. viteae in the presence of tunicamycin (13Houston K.M. Harnett W. J. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The attachment of PC to an N-type glycan is a previously unreported finding, and hence we are interested in elucidating the biosynthetic mechanisms involved. Such information could be of therapeutic value as synthesis of PC-glycans may represent an urgently required (particularly with respect to O. volvulus) novel target for chemotherapy in filarial infections. This article describes three approaches to gaining information on how attachment of PC to an N-type glycan is achieved. They each rely on the fact that newly synthesized glycoproteins, which are destined for secretion, follow a fixed route through the cell prior to exit (reviewed in 14Pfeffer P. Rothman J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 829-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The three approaches are as follows. (i) Pulse-chase time course experiments in combination with immunoprecipitation analysis are used to investigate how soon after synthesis of ES-62 PC is attached. This should indicate whether addition is an early or late event during intracellular trafficking. (ii) Brefeldin A, an inhibitor of intracellular trafficking from the ER to the Golgi, is employed (reviewed in 15Carrol M. Bird M.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Use of this reagent may pinpoint addition of PC to one of these two subcellular locations. (iii) Inhibitors of oligosaccharide processing are used (reviewed in 16Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-Type glycans of newly synthesized glycoproteins undergo a series of trimming/addition steps during trafficking. Inhibitors of oligosaccharide processing are available that block the action of individual processing enzymes, each of which has a characteristic glycan substrate specificity and subcellular location. In combination, these three approaches should help establish when, where, and to what PC is added during trafficking of ES-62. Jirds (Meriones libycus) were infected by subcutaneous injection of A. viteae 3rd stage larvae recovered from infected ticks (Ornithodorus moubata) (17Worms M.J. Terry R.J. Terry A. J. Parasitol. 1961; 47: 963-970Crossref Google Scholar). Adult parasites were recovered following direct visual examination of the skin and underlying body surfaces of jirds. The worms were transferred to Petri dishes containing RPMI “complete” medium (RPMI 1640 with added glucose (1% w/v), glutamic acid (2 mM), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and buffered at pH 7.0 with 20 mM Hepes). Groups of three adult female A. viteae were cultured overnight at 37°C in 10 ml of methionine-free RPMI complete medium, in an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. The medium was removed and replaced with 2 ml of the same containing 0.74 MBq L-[35S]methionine (37 TBq/mmol; Amersham Int., Amersham Place, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire HP7 9NA, UK). After 15 min, the labeling medium was removed and replaced with 10 ml of RPMI complete medium. A chase was then allowed to proceed for defined time periods, before worms were employed for preparation of parasite whole worm extracts (“cell extract”). One group of female worms was also cultured as above for preparation of secreted proteins (“secreted extract”). 15 min after pulsing, the medium was removed and replaced with 5 ml of RPMI complete medium. This was repeated at various time points and then all recovered media was employed for secreted extract preparation. This was essentially undertaken as described previously (18Harnett W. Patterson M. Copeman D.B. Parkhouse R.M.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 1994; 24: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, worms were extensively homogenized in 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.2, in the presence of the proteinase inhibitors Nα-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (50 μg/ml), N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (50 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM). Inhibitors were obtained from Sigma, Poole, Dorset, UK. The samples were then centrifuged (20,000 × g for 25 min), and the supernatant was retained. Worm extracts (cell extract) were stored at −20°C. Spent culture medium was filtered using a 0.22-μm membrane (Sigma) to remove microfilariae released by adult female worms. It was then concentrated using Centriprep tubes with a 30-kDa cut-off membrane (Amicon Ltd., Upper Mill, Stonehouse, Gloucestershire GL10 2BJ, UK). A further concentration step (to 100-150 μl) was then undertaken using Centricon microconcentrators, again with a 30-kDa membrane. These were also employed to “wash” the samples with PBS, pH 7.2. The final volume of all of the samples was adjusted to 200 μl, and they were stored at −20°C. This was undertaken essentially as described previously (18Harnett W. Patterson M. Copeman D.B. Parkhouse R.M.E. Int. J. Parasitol. 1994; 24: 543-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, two 10-μl aliquots of radiolabeled secreted extract were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation using 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mM methionine, and the mean value was determined. Determination of radioactivity was undertaken using an LKB Wallac 1217 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, using a Bio-Rad electrophoresis cell according to the manufacturer's instructions. 10% (w/v) acrylamide gels were employed, and 2-mercaptoethanol was used for reduction of samples. 14C-Labeled molecular weight markers (Amersham Corp.) were also run to allow molecular weight estimations. Gels were treated with the fluorographic reagent AMPLIFY (Amersham Corp.) before exposure to pre-flashed x-ray film (Hyperfilm-MP, Amersham Corp.) and storage at −70°C. Radiolabeled sample (10 μl; ∼1-5,000 dpm) was added to 5 μl of either rabbit antiserum raised against purified ES-62 (anti-ES-62 (4Harnett W. Worms M.J. Kapil A. Grainger M. Parkhouse R.M.E. Parasitology. 1989; 99: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)), 5 μl of normal rabbit serum, or 5 μl of TEPC 15 (1 mg/ml, Sigma), a mouse IgA myeloma protein designated as having specificity for PC based on the finding that PC inhibits its binding to PC-containing molecules such as pneumococcus C polysaccharide (related compounds, glycerophosphorylcholine, phosphonocholine, choline, are all inferior to PC in this respect, suggesting that PC represents the true specificity) (19Leon M.A. Young N.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1424-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), plus 5 μl of normal mouse serum. PBS, pH 7.2, was added to a final volume of 100 μl, and samples were incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at 37°C. An appropriate concentration of either goat anti-rabbit Ig serum or goat anti-mouse IgA and goat anti-mouse Ig (equal volumes) was added, and samples were incubated with gentle agitation for 1 h at 37°C and then left overnight at 4°C to allow precipitates to form. Precipitates were washed (3 ×) with ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, pH 8.3, and then subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. Three adult female A. viteae were placed in a test tube containing 5 ml of methionine-free RPMI complete medium and brefeldin A at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. A control (no brefeldin A) was also set up. Worms were incubated for 2.0 h at 37°C. The medium in each case was removed and replaced with the same but containing 2.0 MBq of L-[35S]methionine. Following 1 h, 20 ml of RPMI complete medium containing brefeldin A (1 μg/ml) was added. Following overnight incubation the medium was removed and secreted, and cell extracts were prepared as described above. These were then subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and in some cases immunoprecipitation/SDS-PAGE. In some experiments, L-[35S]methionine was replaced with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (3.7 MBq; 2. 78 TBq/mmol, Amersham) and methionine-free medium, replaced with choline-free. In these experiments, the preincubation period was increased to 16 h, to optimize the incorporation of [3H]choline into ES-62, and the experiments were terminated after a 60-min chase period for preparation of parasite cell extracts for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Adult female A. viteae were divided into groups of three, placed in test tubes containing 5 ml of methionine-free RPMI complete medium, and one of the following then added: 1-deoxymannojirimycin hydrochloride (dMM), 1-deoxynorijirimycin (dNM), swainsonine (Boehringer Mannheim, UK). dMM and dNM were employed at a concentration of 1 mM and swainsonine at 50 μg/ml. A control (no reagent) was also set up and also a sample in which worms were exposed to brefeldin A. Worms were incubated for 2 h at 37°C, and the media were removed and then replaced with identical media supplemented with 2 MBq of [35S]methionine. After 1 h, 20 ml of RPMI complete medium containing the appropriate inhibitor was added. Following overnight incubation, the medium was removed, and secreted extracts were prepared as described above. The extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. In some experiments, [35S]methionine was replaced with [3H]choline or D-[6-3H]glucosamine hydrochloride (1.11 TBq/mmol; Amersham Corp.), and methionine-free medium was replaced with choline-free or medium containing only 10% (w/v) normal glucose levels (to promote uptake of radiolabeled glucosamine). In these experiments, the preincubation period was increased to 16 h when employing [3H]choline as label, and the chase period was reduced to 60 min when preparing cell extracts. Adult A. viteae were exposed to swainsonine, or no inhibitor as control, as described above but under conditions designed to produce nonradioactive secreted extract. Swainsonine-treated and control-purified secreted extracts (0.5-μg aliquots) were incubated with endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica) or no enzyme as a control as described previously (20Harnett W. Frame M.J. Nor Z.M. MacDonald M. Houston K.M. Parasite. 1994; 1: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 100-ng aliquots were resolved by SDS-PAGE and then probed for reactivity for Galanthus nivalis agglutinin using a digoxigenin-based glycan differentiation kit (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lectin is digoxigenin-labeled: the indicator system is an anti-digoxigenin antibody linked to alkaline phosphatase, with nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate being employed as substrate. 10 μl of either [3H]glucosamine or [3H]choline-labeled ES-62 was subjected to digestion using N-glycosidase F as described previously (11Harnett W. Houston K.M. Amess R. Worms M.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Loss of both radiolabels from the protein was confirmed by analysis of one-tenth volume of each reaction (1 μl of original radiolabeled samples) by SDS-PAGE. The remainder of each sample was made up to 200 μl and individually passed through a column (20 × 1 cm) containing Bio-Gel P-2 gel according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). A series of 300-μl fractions were collected and examined for radioactivity using an LKB Wallac 1217 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter. It has previously been demonstrated that PC is removed from ES-62 by N-glycosidase F (11Harnett W. Houston K.M. Amess R. Worms M.J. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 77: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and absent from ES-62 produced by worms cultured in tunicamycin (13Houston K.M. Harnett W. J. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The logical conclusion from these data is that PC is covalently attached to ES-62 via an N-type glycan. This is further supported by (i) the observation that the [3H]choline-labeled products of ES-62 exposed to N-glycosidase F migrated within the area occupied by released [3H]glucosamine-labeled N-type glycans during gel filtration (Fig. 1); and (ii) radiolabeled choline cannot be displaced from ES-62 by incubation in high concentrations of nonradioactive choline or phosphorylcholine, and likewise radiolabeled choline does not interact with nonradiolabeled ES-62 (results not shown). The aim of this approach was to elucidate when PC is attached to ES-62 during its synthesis, processing, and transport prior to secretion. Groups of adult worms were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 15 min and then secreted, and cell extracts were prepared from parasites subjected to chase for a series of periods. Examination of the trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the secreted extracts indicated that radiolabeled protein first appears in the culture medium within 2-3 h of the initiation of the chase period and that secretion of labeled protein has virtually ceased by 5 h (Fig. 2). Examination of the radiolabeled material by SDS-PAGE/fluorography indicated that, as previously established for A. viteae ES (4Harnett W. Worms M.J. Kapil A. Grainger M. Parkhouse R.M.E. Parasitology. 1989; 99: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), it is almost entirely ES-62 (not shown). We therefore subjected cell extracts obtained from worms subjected to chase for various periods to immunoprecipitation using anti-ES-62 or anti-PC (TEPC 15). Analysis of the immunoprecipitates by SDS-PAGE/fluorography indicated that the labeled protein could be detected faintly as a sharp band at the beginning of the chase period (Fig. 3A, zero time point). Synthesis therefore occurs rapidly under these in vitro conditions, a result consistent with the rate of synthesis observed for the surface/ES product, GP29, from the related parasite, B. malayi (21Selkirk M.E. Gregory W.F. Yazdanbakhsh M. Jenkins R.E. Maizels R.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ES-62 was more clearly detected, and as a more diffuse band, after 20 min of the chase period (Fig. 3A). The more diffuse appearance is likely to be due to glycosylation, although the presence of large amounts of immunoglobulin heavy chain (molecular mass 50-65 kDa) in the immunoprecipitates may interfere with the normal migration of ES-62 and hence cause it to appear more diffuse. Radiolabeled ES-62 can no longer be detected in cell extracts after 2-3 h (Fig. 3A), a result consistent with its appearance in the medium at this time (Fig. 2). The specificity of the immunoprecipitation reaction is shown in Fig. 3B; replacement of anti-ES-62 with normal rabbit serum results in loss of detection of the major band of molecular mass 62 kDa seen at the 60-min time point in Fig. 3A. PC attachment to ES-62 was clearly detected after 60 min of chase, as judged by immunoprecipitation employing TEPC 15 (Fig. 3C). Employment of a control antibody to demonstrate TEPC 15 specificity is not necessary as the antibody does not bind ES-62 shown by biosynthetic radiolabeling to lack PC (see Figs. 7B and Fig. 8). The increase in intensity of ES-62 demonstrated between the 40- and 60-min time points in Fig. 3A may also be consistent with the majority of pulse-labeled ES-62 undergoing PC attachment at this point, as the polyclonal anti-ES-62 reagent contains a strong element of anti-PC activity (4Harnett W. Worms M.J. Kapil A. Grainger M. Parkhouse R.M.E. Parasitology. 1989; 99: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that PC is attached to ES-62 within 40-60 min of synthesis of the protein.Fig. 3Immunoprecipitation/SDS-PAGE analysis of 35S-labeled whole worm (cell) extracts obtained following pulse-chase analysis. Adult A. viteae were pulsed for 15 min with [35S]methionine, and cell extracts were prepared at various time points thereafter. The extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-ES-62 (A), normal rabbit serum (B), or TEPC 15 (C), and samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. An arrow is employed to indicate the presence of ES-62 in A and C. The distances migrated by radiolabeled molecular weight standards are shown on the left of each panel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 7Immunoprecipitation/SDS-PAGE analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled secreted extracts following culture of adult A. viteae with inhibitors of oligosaccharide processing. Adult A.viteae were cultured with [35S]methionine in the presence of no inhibitor (lane a), brefeldin A (lane b), dNM (lane c), dMM (lane d), and swainsonine (lane e). Secreted extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-ES-62 (A) or TEPC 15 (B), followed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography.

Immunoprecipitation analysis employing anti-ES-62 revealed as expected the presence of ES-62 in secreted samples prepared from control worms (Fig. 4, track c) but not brefeldin-A treated (Fig. 4, track d) samples. The antiserum was also employed to examine a cell extract prepared from control and brefeldin A-treated worms. ES-62 was recognized in both extracts but was clearly more abundant in the brefeldin A-treated extract (Fig. 4, track b). This observation is again consistent with retention of ES-62 in brefeldin A-treated worms. The retained ES-62 was found to largely lack PC, however, as demonstrated when [3H]choline was employed to biosynthetically label ES-62 in control and brefeldin A-treated cell extracts (Fig. 5). The amount of radiolabeled protein as a whole in the extract prepared from worms exposed to brefeldin A (track b) is in fact drastically reduced relative to the control (track a). Clearly, therefore, brefeldin A causes major inhibition of attachment of PC to parasite proteins including ES-62.Fig. 5SDS-PAGE analysis of [3H]choline-labeled cell extract following culture of adult A. viteae in the presence of brefeldin A. Adult A. viteae were cultured with [3H]choline in the absence (lane a) or presence (lane b) of brefeldin A, and cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. The distances migrated by radiolabeled molecular weight standards are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The aim of this approach was to disrupt processing of N-linked oligosaccharides in an attempt to prevent PC addition. Three different inhibitors of oligosaccharide processing were employed. For interruption of glucosidase I and II activities, the inhibitor dNM was used. For interruption of mannosidase I and mannosidase II activities, respectively, dMM and swainsonine were employed (for a detailed review of the properties of all three reagents, see 16Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult A. viteae were cultured in the presence of inhibitors and [35S]methionine. Worms in all cases remained healthy (as judged by motility) throughout the culture period, although it was observed by measurement of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the culture medium (not shown) that dNM virtually abolished protein secretion. Similar effects have been noted by other workers with respect to this reagent (reviewed in 16Elbein A.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 497-534Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adult A. viteae were cultured in the presence of [3H]choline or [3H]glucosamine plus dNM, and cell extracts were prepared and examined by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. This clearly indicated that exposure to dNM prevented attachment of PC to ES-62, as the parasite product can be detected when [3H]glucosamine, but not [3H]choline, is employed as radiolabel (cf. lane B, Fig. 6, A and B). Studies on other systems suggest that this result may be explained by a failure of ES-62 in dNM-treated worms to undergo normal intracellular transport. α1-Antitrypsin, for example, accumulates in the rough ER of human hepatoma HepG2 cells following dNM treatment (22Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and our data obtained when employing brefeldin A suggest that ES-62 must leave the ER to acquire PC. Another possibility which must be considered, however, is that PC addition may be dependent upon removal of glucose residues from the target N-glycan. Experiments employing dMM provided strong support for this latter suggestion. Immunoprecipitation analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled secreted ES-62, using anti-ES-62, as expected demonstrated recognition of the parasite product regardless of the inhibitor employed (the negative result with dNM is due to blockage of secretion) (Fig. 7A). When the antibody against the whole molecule was replaced with TEPC 15, however, binding was observed with samples obtained from worms exposed to swainsonine but was virtually abolished when using ES-62 obtained from worms cultured in dMM (Fig. 7B). To rule out the possibility that dMM may simply selectively block secretion of PC-containing ES-62 (not all ES-62 released may contain PC) rather than prevent PC addition, we examined the cell fractions prepared from control and dMM-treated worms by Western blotting. However, there was no evidence of retention of PC-containing ES-62 in the latter (result not shown). Furthermore, there was no evidence of degradation of ES-62 in dMM-treated samples; both samples contained ES-62, but the molecule lacked PC in the dMM-treated sample. These results therefore indicate that the steps in oligosaccharide processing up to the point at which dMM interferes are necessary for addition of PC. This was subsequently confirmed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography analysis of secreted material obtained from worms biosynthetically labeled using [3H]choline (Fig. 8). Interestingly, radiolabeled immunoprecipitates (using anti-ES-62) from dMM-treated worms give a higher signal than control worms, even allowing for their lack of PC (Fig. 7A). This may suggest that dMM increases secretion, a result consistent with measurement of trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the culture medium (not shown). The results obtained with dMM and swainsonine suggest that addition of PC is dependent upon the action of mannosidase I but not mannosidase II. To ensure that this is the case, however, it was necessary to demonstrate that swainsonine is actually interfering with oligosaccharide processing in A. viteae (i.e. blocking mannosidase II activity) under the experimental conditions employed. This was achieved in two ways. (i) ES-62 has previously been shown to weakly bind the lectin G. nivalis agglutinin (20Harnett W. Frame M.J. Nor Z.M. MacDonald M. Houston K.M. Parasite. 1994; 1: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This lectin recognizes terminal mannose, α(1-3), α(1-6), or α(1-2) linked to mannose (23Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Van Damme E.J.M. Peumans W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 728-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As swainsonine blocks removal of two such mannose residues, it would be expected that ES-62 prepared from worms exposed to swainsonine should show greater interaction with the lectin than control protein. As shown in Fig. 9 (cf. lanes B and D), much greater binding is indeed observed. (ii) N-Type glycans lose their sensitivity to endoglycosidase H, following processing from a Man5 to a Man4 structure (24Tarentino A.L. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 811-817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PC-containing N-glycans are not cleaved from ES-62 by this enzyme (20Harnett W. Frame M.J. Nor Z.M. MacDonald M. Houston K.M. Parasite. 1994; 1: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the same is true of the glycan showing weak lectin binding (Fig. 9, lane C). If removal of Man4-5 is prevented by swainsonine, however, it might be predicted that glycan cleavage would take place. Again, as shown in Fig. 9, this is in fact the case as exposure of swainsonine-treated ES-62 to endoglycosidase H virtually abolishes lectin binding (Fig. 9, lane A). The same is also true of binding of TEPC 15 (result not shown). This article describes three approaches to examining addition of PC to ES-62, a major PC-containing secreted product of the rodent filarial nematode, A. viteae. The first approach was designed to investigate when PC is attached to ES-62, during intracellular transport. It was found that if worms were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 15 min, a further 2-3 h was required before labeled ES-62 was detected in the culture medium (Fig. 2). This represents a similar turnover rate to the major surface glycoprotein of related Brugia species, Gp29 (21Selkirk M.E. Gregory W.F. Yazdanbakhsh M. Jenkins R.E. Maizels R.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), but is more rapid than the Brugia “ladder” protein, Gp15/400 (25Selkirk M.E. Gregory W.F. Jenkins R.E. Maizels R.M. Parasitology. 1993; 107: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). With respect to detecting radiolabeled ES-62 within whole worm (cell) extracts, this was possible by immunoprecipitation using anti-ES-62. A faint sharp band was observed on completion of the pulse period and a stronger diffuse band after a further 20 min (Fig. 3A). PC was detected on ES-62 by the immunoprecipitation procedure after 60 min of the chase period. Thus, if we accept that newly synthesized ES-62 does not appear until toward the end of the 15-min pulse period, we can infer that PC is probably added to ES-62 between 40 and 60 min postsynthesis. Based on studies with other proteins (26Palade G. Science. 1975; 189: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2347) Google Scholar, 27Lodish H.F. Kong N. Snider M. Strous G.J.A.M. Nature. 1983; 304: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), this suggests that addition is most likely to take place in the ER or Golgi rather than some later subcellular compartment. However, due to variation in the rate of exit of different proteins from the ER it is impossible to be more exact. The second approach adopted was to investigate the effect of the inhibitor of intracellular trafficking, brefeldin A, on addition of PC to ES-62. ES-62 was readily detected within 35S-labeled cell extracts, by SDS-PAGE/immunoprecipitation employing anti-ES-62, in both control and brefeldin A-treated extracts (particularly the latter). When [3H]choline-labeled cell extracts were examined by SDS-PAGE, however, the intensity of the band detected in brefeldin A-treated extracts was considerably reduced relative to the control. Thus, brefeldin A inhibits addition of PC to ES-62. The primary effect of brefeldin A is considered to be blockage of transfer of protein-containing vesicles from the ER to the Golgi (28Misumi Y. Misumi Y. Miki K. Takatsuki A. Tamura G. Ikehara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11398-11403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yewdell J.W. Bennink J.R. Science. 1989; 244: 1072-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), but it can also cause Golgi disintegration (15Carrol M. Bird M.M. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Both of these previously described observations would favor the Golgi as the site of PC addition to ES-62. The final approach adopted was utilization of inhibitors of oligosaccharide processing. One of the reagents employed, dNM, was found to block both secretion (Fig. 7) and PC addition (Fig. 6), properties common to brefeldin A (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). Since dNM has been previously shown to interfere with transport of some proteins from the ER to the Golgi (22Lodish H.F. Kong N. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), it was considered that our results might reflect dNM acting in a similar manner to brefeldin A, i.e. blocking transport. However, it was observed that several molecules could be labeled with [3H]choline in the cell extract but that dNM unlike brefeldin A was only able to prevent this with respect to some of them. Thus if PC attachment is simply a consequence of being in the correct cellular compartment, then clearly only some of the proteins that can be radiolabeled must be prevented from leaving the ER by dNM treatment. However, we also had to consider that dNM will block oligosaccharide processing at a very early stage. This raised the alternative possibility that the ability of dNM to prevent PC attachment might be due to failure to create a critical substrate. Furthermore, studies with dMM were strongly supportive of this idea in that treatment of worms with this inhibitor led to the secretion of an ES product which lacked PC. The steps in oligosaccharide processing which dMM blocks (30Fuhrmann U. Bause E. Legler G. Ploegh H. Nature. 1984; 307: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig. 10. By inhibiting mannosidase I in the cis Golgi, it prevents the removal of three mannose residues. Clearly, therefore, it can be argued that the removal of one or more of these sugars is crucial for the addition of PC to ES-62. If this does not take place then PC is not attached. As the processing steps which dMM inhibit occur in the cis Golgi, this indeed confirms that PC is added to the N-glycan, post-ER. The failure of dNM to prevent addition of PC to some of the other molecules in the cell extract may suggest that their mode of attachment of PC is not based on use of an N-type glycan. This is consistent with some preliminary data we have obtained that intriguingly suggests that PC may be more frequently attached to nonsecreted molecules of filarial nematodes via O-type glycans. This is currently being explored further. Maizels and colleagues (31Maizels R.M. Burke J. Denham D.A. Parasite Immunol. (Oxf.). 1987; 9: 49-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) have previously produced some preliminary data consistent with PC being attached to molecules containing O-glycans. Addition of PC is not prevented by exposure of A. viteae to swainsonine, the inhibitor of mannosidase II in the medial Golgi. This result can be explained by the oligosaccharide processing steps, which swainsonine inhibits, not being required for PC addition to take place. Fig. 10 shows that two mannose residues are removed from the 6-linked branch of the N-glycan by mannosidase II. The fact that blockage of this step has not prevented PC addition might suggest that PC is added to the 3-linked branch of the glycan. Also, based on its resistance to endoglycosidase H (20Harnett W. Frame M.J. Nor Z.M. MacDonald M. Houston K.M. Parasite. 1994; 1: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and to the finding that N-glycans of swainsonine-treated ES-62 are susceptible (Fig. 9, track a), the substrate oligosaccharide would appear to be subject to processing by mannosidase II. Clearly, if this is the case, PC cannot be bound to the two mannose residues that this enzyme targets. If the N-glycan to which PC is attached is indeed trimmed by mannosidase II, then it must also be subject to the action of GlcNAc transferase I. This is because addition of GlcNac by this enzyme results in generation of the appropriate substrate for mannosidase II. Whether the addition of the GlcNAc is a prerequisite for PC addition is uncertain. If PC addition is an earlier event, then it would appear that it does not inhibit GlcNAc attachment. Conversely, we have no evidence of further oligosaccharide processing beyond removal of Man4-5 in that we have been unable to biosynthetically label ES-62 with [3H]galactose (result not shown) or find any evidence of complex glycans by lectin binding (20Harnett W. Frame M.J. Nor Z.M. MacDonald M. Houston K.M. Parasite. 1994; 1: 179-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This raises the question as to whether further processing is blocked by PC addition and leads us to consider whether transfer of GlcNAc, rather than removal of Man6-8, may be the crucial event for PC addition. Certainly our data are consistent with the glycan of ES-62, to which PC is attached initially, resembling the Man5GlcNAc3 structure which results after the action of GlcNac transferase I and then subsequently being converted into Man3GlcNAc3 by the action of mannosidase II (Fig. 10). However, since PC addition has been shown to be independent of the action of mannosidase II, attachment could with equal likelihood occur following removal of Man4-5. Regardless of which (if either) model is correct, the data obtained using dMM and swainsonine, allied to the lack of evidence for formation of complex glycans, strongly support the site of PC addition as being the medial Golgi. In summary, the data we have obtained provide the first information on the site and mechanism of synthesis of filarial PC-glycans, previously unstudied structures that may play an important role in parasite survival. Furthermore, in addition to being of purely scientific interest, such data in combination with structural analysis could ultimately be of therapeutic value in that it may provide ideas for designing inhibitors of PC attachment for use as drugs. One idea, for example, would be to design a reagent which resembles the glycan substrate for PC addition in order that it may act as a competitive inhibitor. The prevention of PC addition resulting from exposure of worms to reagents such as dNM and dMM confirms that such an approach is a feasible proposition."

The smallest MMP, matrilysin, consists of 19-kDa catalytic domain with an active site zinc ion coordinated within a conserved HEXXHXXGXXH motif. Proteolytic latency is maintained by an N-terminal propeptide of approximately 10 kDa in which a conserved cysteine is coordinated to the catalytic zinc (4Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The larger members of the family, including interstitial collagenases, stromelysins, and gelatinases, possess additional functional and structural domains. In particular, collagenases have a C-terminal domain of about 30 kDa that exhibits sequence homology with hemopexin and vitronectin (5Hunt L.T. Barker W.C. Chen H.R. Protein Sequences & Data Anal. 1987; 1: 21-26PubMed Google Scholar). This so-called pexin domain is essential for the expression of collagenolytic activity; without it, the enzyme retains general peptidase activity but does not hydrolyze native collagen (6Murphy G.

Crystallography of full-length porcine MMP-1 also shows three Ca2+ in the catalytic portion and two Ca2+ in the pexin domain (16Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A.

Ca2+ undoubtedly binds to similar sites in the pexin domain of human collagenase because the binding sites are conserved. Previous studies suggest that Ca2+ stabilizes an active conformation of the MMP that is more stable to denaturants (17Lowry C.L. McGeehan G. LeVine III, H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and less susceptible to proteolysis (18Housley T.J. Baumann A.P. Braun I.D. Davis G. Seperack P.K. Welhelm S.M. J. Biol.

However, the precise stereochemical basis for Ca2+ stabilization is unknown because a three-dimensional model of a Ca2+-free MMP is not available for comparison. To provide additional insight into the relationship between MMP structure and calcium binding, we correlated the effect of Ca2+ on catalytic activity and protein structure using intrinsic protein fluorescence and circular dichroism as structural indicators. Ca2+ concentration was manipulated either by the chelating agent EGTA or by dilution. EGTA was chosen because its affinity for Ca2+ is comparable with that of EDTA, 2log KEDTA = 10.6 and log KEGTA = 11.0 for Ca2+; log KEDTA = 16.4 and log KEGTA = 12.9 for Zn2+ (19Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986: 404-405Google Scholar). although its affinity for Zn2+ is much lower than that of EDTA (19Dawson R.M.C. Elliott D.C. Elliott W.H. Jones K.M. Data for Biochemical Research. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1986: 404-405Google Scholar).

Furthermore, these changes were independent of the method used to alter calcium concentration. A recombinant human fibroblast collagenase expression vector was generously supplied by Dr. G. McGeehan, Glaxo-Wellcome (Research Triangle Park, NC). The recombinant protein, which lacks the propeptide, was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (20Zhang Y.N. Gray R.D. J.

The substrate peptide Dnp-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Trp-Ala-D-Arg-NH2 (DnpS) was synthesized by Stack and Gray (22Stack M.S. Gray R.D. J. Biol.

Type I collagen from calf skin, soybean trypsin inhibitor, 4,4-dithiopyridine, MOPS, and EGTA were from Sigma. CaCl2 2H2O was from EM Science (Cherry Hill, NJ); it contained 6 ng zinc/g. Brij 35 (prepared and packaged under nitrogen) was from Pierce, and trypsin (sequencing grade) was from Promega (Madison, WI). Zinc reference standard solution was from Fisher. MMP activity was measured with DnpS, TPS, or collagen as substrate. Hydrolysis of DnpS by rMMP-1 was assessed by high pressure liquid chromatography as described (22Stack M.S. Gray R.D. J. Biol.

Hydrolysis of TPS by HUVEC MMP-1 was measured in a continuous spectrophotometric assay using 4,4′-dithiopyridine to trap the thiol peptide product, HSCH(iBu)-Leu-Gly-OEt (23Weingarten H. Feder J.

Collagen degradation products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar); the fraction of degraded α-chains was estimated by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels (26Welgus H.G.

All spectra have buffer blanks subtracted, and fluorescence intensities are presented in arbitrary units. Difference spectra were generated by subtracting the relevant absolute spectra using software supplied by SLM-Aminco. CD spectra were recorded with a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter as described previously (20Zhang Y.N. Gray R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8015-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All assays and spectra were obtained at 25°C. Zinc analyses were conducted by furnace atomic absorption analysis. To assess the effect of Ca2+ binding on rMMP-1 secondary structure, we recorded the low UV CD spectrum of proMMP-1 in the presence and the absence of the chelating agent, EGTA. As shown in Fig. 1A, EGTA had no effect on the CD spectrum of the enzyme. The addition of Ca2+ to the EGTA-treated protein also elicited no observable change in CD spectrum. Similar results were obtained with the recombinant MMP-1 (data not shown). Thus, we conclude Ca2+ binding to MMP-1 resulted in no global changes in secondary structure. We also measured the emission spectrum of rMMP-1 in the presence of 5 mM CaCl2 before and after the addition of 6 mM EGTA to assess Ca2+-dependent changes in tertiary structure. Fig. 1B shows that the addition of EGTA resulted in decreased fluorescence intensity of 10% at 340 nm and a red shift in the emission maximum from 334 to 340 nm (compare spectra 1 and 2). Similar changes in emission intensity were observed when HUVEC procollagenase was diluted into Ca2+-free buffer (Fig. 1B, spectrum 4) and then supplemented with added Ca2+ (Fig. 1B, spectrum 3). This suggests that the fluorescence changes in spectra 1 and 2 result from dissociation of Ca2+ induced by the chelating agent. Lack of an obvious shift in emission maximum in comparing spectra 3 and 4 may result from the presence of the propeptide. This portion of the protein contains one tryptophan, which could have obscured the shift in emission maximum associated with Ca2+ dissociation from the enzyme lacking the propeptide. The emission characteristics of the quenched residue (shown in Fig. 1B, spectrum 5) were assessed by subtracting the spectrum measured in the presence of EGTA (spectrum 2) from that obtained in its absence (spectrum 1). The maximum in the difference spectrum 5 at 320 nm indicates that the quenched fluorophores are predominantly tryptophyl residues that reside in a hydrophobic environment (28Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 341Crossref Google Scholar). The contribution of tyrosyl residues to rMMP-1 fluorescence was ascertained by subtracting the emission spectrum obtained with excitation at 297 nm (where Trp alone absorbs) from the spectrum obtained with excitation at 280 nm (Trp and Tyr absorb). The resulting difference spectra (Fig. 2) allow comparison of the emission properties of tyrosyl residues in the Ca2+-free and Ca2+-bound forms of the enzyme. Each spectrum exhibits a maximum near 315 nm, which is strongly red shifted from that expected for tyrosine in aqueous solution (28Lakowicz J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 341Crossref Google Scholar). A small decrease in emission intensity was observed, suggesting that the Ca2+-dependent conformational differences are sensed by tyrosyl as well as tryptophyl residues. Titration data illustrating the dependence of fluorescence and catalytic activity on [Ca2+] are shown in the Hill plots of Fig. 3. Ca2+ binding as assessed by changes in fluorescence was cooperative (Hill coefficient, 2.9; 50% saturation at 0.43 mM Ca2+). When the Ca2+ dependence of rMMP-1 activity was assayed with a peptide substrate, the resulting Hill plot also indicated cooperative Ca2+ binding (Hill coefficient, 1.7; 50% saturation at 0.23 mM [Ca2+]). When the [Ca2+] was manipulated by dilution rather than EGTA, cooperative Ca2+ binding to native HUVEC MMP-1 was also observed (Hill coefficient, 2.0; 50% saturation at 0.20 mM Ca2+). Because similar results were obtained whether [Ca2+] was altered by EGTA or dilution, we conclude that the effects of the chelating agent result from Ca2+ dissociation from the enzyme rather than removal of catalytic Zn2+. To determine if the effects of Ca2+ on activity and fluorescence were reversible, we compared the catalytic activity of the recombinant enzyme with DnpS and collagen prior to Ca2+ removal, after Ca2+ removal with EGTA, and after reconstitution with Ca2+. Previous reports (11Seltzer J.L. Jeffrey J.J. Eisen A.Z. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 485: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Swann J.C. Reynolds J.J. Galloway W.A. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) indicate that prolonged incubation of collagenase with EDTA resulted in removal of zinc and irreversible denaturation of the protein. The data in Table I show that activity against both DnpS and collagen was completely lost on treatment with EGTA. Loss of activity and fluorescence changes were reversed by adding Ca2+, even 24 h after removal of the metal ion.Table I.Effect of EGTA and Ca2+ on the activity of rMMP-1AdditionActivity (pmoles degraded/min)CollagenaActivity determined at 25°C for 50 min with 0.7 mg/ml collagen and 0.3 μM rMMP-1.DnpSbActivity determined at 25°C for 60 min with 20 μM DnpS and 0.2 μM rMMP-1.None2.79.77 mM EGTA007 mM EGTA followed after 10 min by 8 mM CaCl22.610.27 mM EGTA followed after 24 h by 8 mM CaCl22.711.2a Activity determined at 25°C for 50 min with 0.7 mg/ml collagen and 0.3 μM rMMP-1.b Activity determined at 25°C for 60 min with 20 μM DnpS and 0.2 μM rMMP-1. Open table in a new tab The present studies, conducted with full-length rMMP-1 that includes both the catalytic and pexin domains, demonstrate that acquisition of catalytic activity by collagenase is coupled to protein conformational changes induced by Ca2+ binding. Binding was cooperative as assessed by both structural and activity changes. The observation that a lower Ca2+ concentration is required for catalytic activity compared with development of the fluorescence changes suggests that fewer binding sites influence catalysis, whereas the fluorescence changes involve sites other than those necessary for catalytic efficiency. Our studies with the full-length protein extend previous studies conducted with the catalytic domain alone. Lowry et al. (17Lowry C.L. McGeehan G. LeVine III, H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1992; 12: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that both Ca2+ and Zn2+ stabilized a recombinant collagenase catalytic domain against denaturation by GdnHCl, and Housley et al. (18Housley T.J. Baumann A.P. Braun I.D. Davis G. Seperack P.K. Welhelm S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4481-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that Ca2+ stabilized the catalytic domain of recombinant stromelysin against heat denaturation. In addition, activation of prostromelysin-1 by an organomercurial in the presence of 0.1 mM Ca2+ resulted in autolysis that could be prevented with 5 mM Ca2+ (18Housley T.J. Baumann A.P. Braun I.D. Davis G. Seperack P.K. Welhelm S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4481-4487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data indicate that Ca2+ stabilizes a compact protein structure that is less susceptible to denaturation and proteolysis. Our results show that Ca2+ binding to full-length rMMP-1 results in local conformational change(s) that do not detectably alter the secondary structure of the protein but do change tertiary structure as reflected in the environment of tryptophyl and tyrosyl residues. The change in tertiary structure in the absence of secondary structural changes suggests that Ca2+ removal may produce a “molten globule-like” structure (20Zhang Y.N. Gray R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8015-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The emission maximum of denatured MMP-1 is at 356 nm (20Zhang Y.N. Gray R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8015-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), characteristic of tryptophan in water, whereas the emission maximum of the Ca2+-deficient enzyme shifts only to 340 nm. Thus the change in tryptophyl environment brought about by Ca2+ release is less drastic than complete unfolding. In our study of GdnHCl-induced denaturation of rMMP-1, we observed a folding intermediate with an emission maximum at 340 nm at 1 M denaturant (20Zhang Y.N. Gray R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8015-8021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that the Ca2+-free form of MMP-1 in the present study is the same as this intermediate because in 1 M GdnHCl, there was an increase, rather than a decrease, in emission intensity. MMP-1 contains one tryptophyl residue in the propeptide, three in the catalytic domain and four in the pexin domain. Assignment of the fluorescence changes to particular residues is of course impossible from the data at hand. Lovejoy et al. (13Lovejoy B. Hassell A.M. Luther M.A. Weigl D. Jordan S.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8207-8217Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) suggested that in 19-kDa collagenase one of the calcium ions and the structural zinc may stabilize a surface loop by fastening it to two β strands. Neither the loop nor the two strands contain tyrosyl or tryptophyl side chains that might be directly affected by Ca2+. Thus, it is likely that any conformational change induced by Ca2+ binding at this site is propagated to other regions of the structure. The two Ca2+ in the pexin domain of pig collagenase also appear to link structural domains together: β-sheet-1 to sheet 3 and β-sheet-4 to sheet 2 (16Li J. Brick P. O'Hare M.C. Skarzynski T. Lloyd L.F. Curry V.A. Clark I.M. Bigg H.F. Hazleman B.L. Cawston T.E. Blow D.M. Structure. 1995; 3: 541-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Two of the four pexin tryptophyl residues are located within these sheets; Trp349 is in sheet 2, and Trp398 is in sheet 3. Thus, it is reasonable to assign at least a portion of the Ca2+-dependent fluorescence change to them. In addition, both tryptophyls are close in the primary structure to tyrosyl residues [YW349A and YW398RY (29Goldberg G.I. Wilhelm S.M. Kronberger A. Bauer E.A. Grant G.A. Eisen A.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6600-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)]. Variation in the relationship between these groups should influence the efficiency of excitation energy transferred from tyrosyl to tryptophyl residues. However, the quenching of tyrosyl emission observed on Ca2+ dissociation was accompanied by decreased, rather than increased, tryptophyl emission, as would be expected if altered transfer efficiency were the sole basis for the altered fluorescence."

Sendai virus is a prototypic paramyxovirus that replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm. The single strand negative-sense RNA genome of the Sendai virus encodes at least six genes, np, p, m, f, hn, and l (1Kingsbury D.W. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Fundamental Virology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991: 507-524Google Scholar). The p gene is transcribed into two polycistronic mRNAs, P/C and V/C (2Vidal S. Curran J. Kolakofsky D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2017-2022Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The polycistronic P/C mRNA is translated to synthesize the P, C, C′, Y1, and Y2 proteins from independent start sites in two overlapping reading frames. Although the C protein is expressed at levels comparable with P in infected cells (3Dillon P.J. Gupta K.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 974-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is a minor component of virions (4Portner A. Gupta K.C. Seyer J.M. Beachey E.H. Kingsbury D.W. Virus Res. 1986; 6: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The other proteins, C′, Y1, and Y2 are expressed at relatively low levels in virus-infected cells (3Dillon P.J. Gupta K.C. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 974-977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the P protein is required for viral transcription and replication (1Kingsbury D.W. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Fundamental Virology. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1991: 507-524Google Scholar, 5Horikami S.M. Curran J. Kolakofsky D. Moyer S.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4901-4908Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the functional significance of the C proteins is not precisely defined. A recent study has suggested that the C protein may be involved in the regulation of viral transcription (6Curran J. Marq J.B. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1992; 189: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). To define further the functions of the P and C proteins, we have developed ribozymes to block the P/C mRNA expression in virus-infected cells. Ribozymes are RNA molecules with self-cleaving enzymatic activities (7Cech T.R. Science. 1987; 236: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 8Uhlenbeck O.C. Nature. 1987; 328: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Ribozymes can be designed to act in trans to specifically cleave virtually any RNA molecule (9Haseloff J. Gerlach W.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), making them particularly attractive as antiviral agents (10Sarver N. Cantin E.M. Chang P.S. Zaia J.A. Ladne P.A. Stephens D.A.

However, the factors that influence ribozyme and substrate interactions in vivo are not well defined. In many in vivo studies, very high ribozyme:substrate ratios were necessary to detect ribozyme activity (17Cotten M. Birnstiel M.L. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3861-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 18Cameron F.H. Jennings P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Graf L. Gerlach W.L. Antisense Res. Dev. 1993; 3: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Ribozymes to be used intracellularly are generally optimized using cell-free cleavage assays. Considerable disparity appears to exist between in vitro kinetics and intracellular activity (18Cameron F.H. Jennings P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9139-9143Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 19L'Huillier P.J. Davis S.R. Bellamy A.R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4411-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This could be due to differential intracellular structural properties of the ribozyme and/or substrate and/or to RNA-protein interactions. These discrepancies reflect that in vitro kinetics are frequently determined with synthetic model ribozymes that do not accurately represent the ribozymes that would be synthesized in vivo from expression vectors. Ribozymes expressed intracellularly from expression vectors contain modifications to their basic structure due to the incorporation of vector sequences. These changes may influence appropriate folding and thus inherently affect activity. Consequently, cell free kinetics would be more predictive of intracellular ribozyme activity if they were performed with RNA transcripts containing comparable structural elements as those synthesized intracellularly. In the present study, we compared the cell-free and intracellular activities of several hammerhead-type ribozymes to develop the most effective intracellular ribozymes targeted to the Sendai virus P/C mRNA. Ribozymes were designed such that their in vitro and in vivo structural elements would be essentially identical. We examined the influence of parameters effecting ribozyme-substrate interactions, namely hybridization arm length (HAL) 1The abbreviations used are: HALhybridization arm lengthNESnonhybridizing extraneous sequencesSTOsingle turnoverMTOmultiple turnoverUTRuntranslated regionntnucleotide(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresissTobRSVsatellite RNA of tobacco ring spot virussRzself-cleaving ribozymetTtranscription terminator. and nonhybridizing extraneous sequences (NES) on ribozyme activity. Manipulating these parameters, we generated ribozymes that inhibited p/c gene expression by nearly 95% in transiently transfected cells at a low ribozyme:substrate molar ratio. These results indicate that the ribozyme strategy is amenable for studying the function of p gene encoded proteins. Moreover, our study shows that efficient ribozymes can be expressed intracellularly by manipulating their structural features. hybridization arm length nonhybridizing extraneous sequences single turnover multiple turnover untranslated region nucleotide(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis satellite RNA of tobacco ring spot virus self-cleaving ribozyme transcription terminator. All recombinant DNA manipulations were performed following standard techniques (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Sense and antisense ribozyme plasmid constructs, pcRz1 and pcRz2 (Fig. 2A), respectively, were generated from two synthetic complementary oligodeoxynucleotides (oligonucleotides, Table I). The oligonucleotides contained the 22-nucleotide (nt) catalytic region from the satellite RNA of the tobacco ring spot virus (sTobRSV) (22Forster A.C. Symons R.H.

BamHI sites (Table I) were designed at the termini of the duplex for cloning into the BamHI site of the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNAI/amp (Invitrogen). Equivalent amounts of complementary oligonucleotides were mixed, heated to 95°C for 3 min, and annealed by slowly cooling to room temperature. Annealed oligonucleotides (duplexes) were then digested with BamHI, phenol/chloroform extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and ligated to the BamHI-digested and alkaline phosphatase-treated pcDNAI/amp.Table I.Synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides used to generate ribozyme and antisense constructsRz1aThe same pair of oligonucleotides was used to clone Rz1 (sense orientation) and Rz2 (antisense orientation); lowercase sequences, restriction sites; underlined sequences, hybridization arms complementary to P/C mRNA; sRz, self-cleaving ribozyme cassette from sTobRSV, site of sTobRSV self-cleavage indicated in bold italics; tT, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase terminator sequences.5′ CTCggatccCCGTGGCTGTCTCCTGATGAGTCCGAGAGGACGAAACTGCTGGGTGTGggatccGAG-3′3′ GAGcctaggGGCACCGACAGAGGACATCTCAGGCTCTCCTGCTTTGACGACCCACACcctaggCTC-5′Rz2aThe same pair of oligonucleotides was used to clone Rz1 (sense orientation) and Rz2 (antisense orientation); lowercase sequences, restriction sites; underlined sequences, hybridization arms complementary to P/C mRNA; sRz, self-cleaving ribozyme cassette from sTobRSV, site of sTobRSV self-cleavage indicated in bold italics; tT, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase terminator sequences.5′ CTCggatccCACACCCAGCAGTTTCGTCCTCTCGGACTCATCAGGAGACAGCCACGGggatccGAC-3′3′ GAGcctaggGTGTGGGTCGTCAAAGCAGGAGAGCCTGAGTAGTCCTCTGTCGGTGCCcctaccCTC-5′Rz135′ agctt CCGTGGCTGTCTCCTGATGAGTCCGAGAGGACGAAACTGCTGGGTGTGg-3′3′ aGGCACCGACAGAGGACTACTCAGGCTCTCCTGCTTTGACGACCCACACcctag-5′Rz95′ agcttGGCTGTCTCCTGATGAGTCCGAGAGGACGAAACTGCTGGGg-3′3′ aCCGACAGAGGACTACTCAGGCTCTCCTGCTTTGACGACCCcctag-5′antiPC5′ agcttCCGTGGCTGTCTCGACTGCTGGGTGTGg-3′3′ aGGCACCGACAGAGCTGACGACCCACACcctag-5′sRz5′ gatccGATACCCTGTCACCGGATGTGTTTTCCGGTCTGATGAGTCCGTGAGGACGAAACAGGACTGTCg-3′3′ gCTATGGGACAGTGGCCTACACAAAAGGCCAGACTACTCAGGCACTCCTGCTTTGTCCTGACAGcttaa-5′tT5′ aattcTAGCATAACCCCTTGGGGCCTCTAAACGGGTCTTGAGGGGTTTTTGCgc-3′3′ gATCGTATTGGGGAACCCCGGAGATTTGCCCAGAACTCCCCAAAAAACGcgccgg-5′a The same pair of oligonucleotides was used to clone Rz1 (sense orientation) and Rz2 (antisense orientation); lowercase sequences, restriction sites; underlined sequences, hybridization arms complementary to P/C mRNA; sRz, self-cleaving ribozyme cassette from sTobRSV, site of sTobRSV self-cleavage indicated in bold italics; tT, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase terminator sequences.

Upon annealing, these oligonucleotides formed duplexes with cohesive restriction sites at both termini for their directed ligation into the HindIII and BamHI (H/B) sites of pcDNAI/amp. Upon ligation of duplexes to pcDNAI/amp, the following plasmids were generated, pcRz13, pcRz9, and pcanti-PC (Fig. 2B). The antisense duplex (anti-PC) contained 27 nt complementary to the P/C mRNA from nt 58-84, without the catalytic core (Table I). Additional duplexes (Table I) were also synthesized which contained the sequences for a cis-acting self-cleaving hammerhead-type ribozyme (sRz = s) from sTobRSV and a T7 RNA polymerase transcription terminator (tT = t) (23Rosenberg A.H.

These duplexes were inserted downstream of the ribozyme and antisense duplexes in pcRz13, pcRz9, and pcanti-PC to generate the plasmids pcRZ13st, pcRz9st, and pcanti-PCst, respectively (Fig. 2C). Ribozymes were designated based on the structural characteristics of their HAL and NES (Table II).

Open table in a new tab The full-length Sendai virus p/c gene cDNA was excised from the H/B sites of pg1f1/PC (24Patwardhan S. Gupta K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4907-4913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and subcloned into the same sites in pcDNAI/amp to generate pcPC (Fig. 2D). All inserts were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. Ribozymes were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase with MEGAscript or MEGAshortscript kits (Ambion) according to the supplier's protocols. Various sized ribozymes (Table II) were generated by run-off transcription from plasmids linearized at EcoRI (E) or BamHI (B) site or by transcription from supercoiled plasmid templates containing the self-cleaving ribozyme (sRz). The substrate molecule (P274) corresponding to the first 274 nt of the 5′-terminal region of the P/C mRNA was similarly synthesized from pcPC linearized at StyI site (Fig. 2D). Transcripts were labeled with a trace amount of [α-32P]UTP (25 pmol; 800 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Corp.), and their yields were determined by trichloroacetic acid precipitation on filter paper squares (25Gupta K.C. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 226-228PubMed Google Scholar). The quality of RNA transcripts was assessed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). Since only the transcripts of the appropriate size were synthesized, no further purification was necessary. Rate constants for the cleavage of P/C mRNA (P274) were determined under single turnover (STO) conditions with excess ribozyme or under multiple turnover (MTO) conditions with excess substrate. The STO reactions were performed using 2-10-fold molar excess of ribozyme. Substrate concentration [S] was kept at 80 nM while ribozyme concentrations [R] ranged from 160 to 800 nM. MTO reactions were performed with 5-20-fold molar excess of the substrate. [S] ranged from 50 to 200 nM with a constant [R] of 10 nM. Substrate and ribozyme transcripts were combined in cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4 and 1 mM EDTA) and allowed to anneal for 5 min at 37°C prior to initiation of the cleavage. An additional set of reactions was performed to determine the influence of preformed secondary structures on ribozyme activity. For these reactions, ribozyme (160 and 400 nM) and the substrate P274 (80 nM) were preincubated at 95°C for 3 min and annealed by slowly (over 30 min) cooling to the reaction temperature of 37°C. All cleavage reactions were initiated by adjusting the MgCl2 concentration to 20 mM and incubated at 37°C in a total volume of 20-30 μl. Reactions were quenched at various times by mixing with an equal volume of stop solution (40 mM EDTA, 95% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol) and then immediately frozen to −70°C. Heat-denatured reaction products were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (8% polyacrylamide, 7 M urea) followed by autoradiography. The extent of substrate cleaved was quantified from autoradiographs scanned by a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Initial cleavage rates (kobs) were determined from logarithmic plots of the fraction of substrate remaining (fracS) versus time during the earliest phase of the reactions when product formation was linear with time. For the STO reactions, several ribozyme concentrations [R] were used to obtain the pseudo-first order rate constants from Eadie-Hofstee plots of the kobs versus kobs/[R] (26Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12042-12054Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) using a linear curve fit analysis (Kaleidagraph, Synergy Software). The “pseudo-Michaelis constant,” (Km[high′) and the initial cleavage rate (k2)values were obtained from the slope and Y intercept, respectively. Km[high′ values describe the ribozyme concentration [R] at which the rate (k2 = Vmax) of the reaction is half-maximal (k2/2). The MTO constants were similarly obtained from Eadie-Hofstee plots of the initial velocity (ν) versus (ν)/[S] (27Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985Google Scholar, 28Fedor M.J. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1668-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Initial velocities were obtained from the early phase of the reactions when less than 10% of the substrate [S] had been converted to product. For the MTO reactions, the Km value reflects the substrate concentration [S] at which the reaction rate is half-maximal (Vmax/2). CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum in a moist atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37°C in 35-mm dishes. Subconfluent CV-1 cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 with vTF7-3, a recombinant vaccinia virus that expresses T7 RNA polymerase in the cytoplasm of infected cells (29Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Supercoiled pcPC was transfected alone or cotransfected with a 5-fold molar excess of linearized or supercoiled ribozyme (or antisense) plasmid (3 μg of pcPC and 15 μg of pcRz or pcanti-PC) using 10 μl/ml of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). DNA-Lipofectin complexes were added to cells 30 min after vTF7-3 infection and incubated at 37°C. At 14 h postinfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing Mg2+ and Ca2+ (phosphate-buffered saline+), and labeled with 100 μCi/ml 35S-Translabel (ICN) in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After labeling for 4 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline(+) and lysed with 500 μl of RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) (30Mehdi H. Ono E. Gupta K.C. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 91: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nuclei and cellular debris were removed by pelleting at 15,000 × g for 25 min. Unless indicated otherwise, the P and C proteins were immunoprecipitated from 40 μl of lysate using polyclonal anti-P (31Byrappa S. Hendricks D.D. Pan Y.-B. Seyer J.M. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1995; 208: 408-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and anti-C antisera (32Hendricks D.D. Ono E. Seyer J.M. Gupta K.C. Virology. 1993; 197: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis the gels were dried and autoradiographed. Protein levels were quantified by densitometry scanning of the autoradiographs as described above. To control for variations due to transfection, P expression levels were compared with expression in pcPC alone and to pcRz2 and pcPC cotransfected cells. The transfection experiments were repeated three times, and statistical analysis (paired t test) was performed. As the level of C protein expression paralleled P protein expression, only the P quantifications are presented. Gel-purified 32P-labeled ribozyme transcripts were subjected to RNase T2 digestion to determine the effect of the 3′-NES on ribozyme stability. Rz13B (1 nt 3′-NES), Rz13E (31 nt 3′-NES), and Rz13st (17 nt 3′-NES) were all synthesized in vitro as described above and purified from denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Appropriate RNA bands were sliced out from gels, and RNA was eluted by soaking gel pieces in diethyl pyrocarbonate/H2O containing 10 μg of tRNA at 37°C for 12 h. The RNA was precipitated with EtOH, dried, and resuspended in 15 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate/H2O. RNA was incubated in digestion buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, and 0.003 unit of T2) for up to 60 min. Reactions were quenched by adding aliquots to an equal volume of the stop buffer as described above. Reaction products were resolved by denaturing PAGE and quantified by scanning densitometry of autoradiographs as described above. Reactions were performed two times with similar results. Secondary structures of the various ribozyme and substrate RNAs were predicted using RNAFOLD (version 2.0, Scientific & Educational Software). This software has been developed using the algorithm of Zuker et al. (33Zuker M. Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2707-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and is based on physiological salt concentration. Ribozyme structures were modeled in the presence and absence of substrate, using the minimal target region (PT) sequences. To model the R-S interactions with RNAFOLD, substrate sequences were linked to ribozyme sequences with a spacing of 10 non-interacting bases. Similar hairpins were obtained when ribozyme and substrate RNAs were analyzed by alternate RNA folding programs. Our previous studies have shown that relatively low amounts of antisense oligonucleotides (50-100-fold molar excess over the mRNA) directed to the 5′-UTR of the P/C mRNA efficiently inhibited cell-free synthesis of all the P/C mRNA-encoded proteins (34Gupta K.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7492-7496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, both the RNAFOLD predicted (Fig. 1B) and the experimental determination of the secondary structure (35Gupta K.C. Ono E. Xu X. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1223-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) suggested that this region lacked strongly folded structures. Thus, we suspected this region of the 5′-UTR would be readily accessible for ribozyme interaction. To target this region, we constructed ribozymes containing the catalytic domain of sTobRSV (22Forster A.C. Symons R.H. Cell. 1987; 49: 211-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) flanked by 18 (9-mer ribozymes) or 26 (13-mer ribozymes) nt complementary to the P/C mRNA at bases 62-80 and 58-84, respectively (Fig. 1A). The GUC cleavage site at nt 71 is located upstream of all the translation start sites (36Gupta K.C. Patwardhan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8553-8556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the cleavage at this site would abrogate the synthesis of all the p gene encoded proteins. Therefore, we targeted only one site for ribozyme interaction. Several hammerhead ribozymes were compared to assess the influence of hybridization arm length (HAL) and nonhybridizing extraneous sequences (NES) on the cleavage of the substrate P274. Ribozymes contained HAL of 13 nt (% GC = 65) or 9 nt (% GC = 67) each with varying NES length (Fig. 2, Fig. 3; Table II). NES are sequences transcribed along with the ribozyme which are not part of the hybridizing arms or the catalytic core. The NES for our ribozymes contained vector-derived sequences generated during run-off transcription of plasmids linearized at EcoRI site (E) (31 nt 3′-NES) or BamHI site (B) (1 nt 3′-NES) or contained sequences from intact plasmids containing the cis-acting self-cleaving ribozyme (sRz) and the T7 RNA polymerase terminator (tT) (designated as st; 17 nt 3′-NES). Although the efficacy of sRz self-cleavage in cells was not determined, efficient self-cleavage was observed in vitro especially when the sRz was upstream of the tT (data not shown).Fig. 3RNAFOLD predicted secondary structures for ribozyme (R-R) and ribozyme-substrate (R-S) interactions. Left panels present structures of ribozymes alone (R-R). Right panels represent the predicted interactions between the ribozyme and the substrate target region (PT). The target regions are indicated between the open triangles. Arrowhead points to the cleavage site, and the hybridization arms are marked by solid lines. A presents ribozymes synthesized from linearized plasmids at the indicated restriction sites (B = 1 and E = 31 nt of 3′-NES, 17 nt of 5′-NES for Rz13 and Rz9, and 35 nt for Rz1). B presents ribozyme and antisense transcripts containing the self-cleaving ribozyme (sRz) and T7 terminator (tT, in brackets). The site of self-cleavage is indicated by a small arrow. A large arrow denotes ribozyme putatively generated following self-cleavage by sRz (Rz13s, Rz9s, and anti-pCs). Predicted interactions between PT and Rz13s, Rz9s, and anti-PCs are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) RNAFOLD predicted secondary structures for ribozyme RNA in the absence of substrate (left panel), and the structures predicted for the ribozyme-substrate interactions (R-S = r = PT) (right panel) are shown in Fig. 3, A and B.
