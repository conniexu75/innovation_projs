https://openalex.org/W2029157767,"Leukocytes respond to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at nanogram per milliliter concentrations with secretion of cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Excess secretion of TNF-α causes endotoxic shock, an often fatal complication of infection. LPS in the bloodstream rapidly binds to the serum protein, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), and cellular responses to physiological levels of LPS are dependent on LBP. CD14, a differentiation antigen of monocytes, was found to bind complexes of LPS and LBP, and blockade of CD14 with monoclonal antibodies prevented synthesis of TNF-α by whole blood incubated with LPS. Thus, LPS may induce responses by interacting with a soluble binding protein in serum that then binds the cell surface protein CD14."

https://openalex.org/W2140922568,"We have cloned a partial cDNA encoding murine stem cell factor (SCF) and show that the gene is syntenic with the Sl locus on mouse chromosome 10. Using retroviral vectors to immortalize fetal liver stromal cell lines from mice harboring lethal mutations at the Sl locus (Sl/Sl), we have shown that SCF genomic sequences are deleted in these lines. Furthermore, two other mutations at Sl, Sld and Sl12H, are associated with deletions or alterations of SCF genomic sequences. In vivo administration of SCF can reverse the macrocytic anemia and locally repair the mast cell deficiency of Sl/Sld mice. We have also provided biological and physical evidence that SCF is a ligand for the c-kit receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2037695813,"Mutations at the steel locus (Sl) of the mouse affect the same cellular targets as mutations at the white spotting locus (W), which is allelic with the c-kit proto-oncogene. We show that KL, a hematopoietic growth factor obtained from conditioned medium of BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts that stimulates the proliferation of mast cells and early erythroid progenitors, specifically binds to the c-kit receptor. The predicted amino acid sequence of isolated KL-specific cDNA clones suggests that KL is synthesized as an integral transmembrane protein. Linkage analysis maps the KL gene to the Sl locus on mouse chromosome 10, and KL sequences are deleted in the genome of the Sl mouse. These results indicate that the Sl locus encodes the ligand of the c-kit receptor, KL."
https://openalex.org/W1595402802,"Human mammary cells present on the cell surface a polymorphic epithelial mucin (PEM) which is developmentally regulated and aberrantly expressed in tumors. PEM carries tumor-associated epitopes recognized by the monoclonal antibodies HMFG-1, HMFG-2, and SM-3. Previously isolated partial cDNA clones revealed that the core protein contained a large domain consisting of variable numbers of 20-amino acid repeat units. We now report the full sequence for PEM, as deduced from cDNA sequences. The encoded protein consists of three distinct regions: the amino terminus consisting of a putative signal peptide and degenerate repeats; the major portion of the protein which is the tandem repeat region; the carboxyl terminus consisting of degenerate tandem repeats and a unique sequence containing a transmembrane sequence and a cytoplasmic tail. Potential O-glycosylation sites (serines or threonines) make up more than one-fourth of the amino acids. Length variations in the tandem repeat result in PEM being an expressed variable number tandem repeat locus. Tandem repeats appear to be a general characteristic of mucin core proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2151900782,"We report the purification and N-terminal amino acid sequence of a novel mast cell growth factor, termed MGF, from the supernatants of a murine stromal cell line. A panel of interleukin 3-dependent cell lines were screened for responsiveness to partially purified MGF in [3H]thymidine incorporation assays; proilferative stimulation of these cells in response to MGF correlated with expression of mRNA for the c-kit proto-oncogene. MGF was shown to be a ligand for c-kit by cross-linking 125I-labeled MGF to c-kit-expressing cells with subsequent immunoprecipitation of the complex with antiserum specific for the C-terminus of c-kit. This establishes MGF as a ligand for the c-kit protein."
https://openalex.org/W2149604229,"We have previously reported the identification of a novel mast cell growth factor (MGF) that was shown to be a ligand for c-kit and is encoded by a gene that maps near the steel locus on mouse chromosome 10. We now report the cloning of cDNAs encoding the MGF protein. The MGF protein encoded by this cDNA can be expressed in a biologically active form as either a membrane bound protein or as a soluble factor. The soluble protein promotes the proliferation of MGF-responsive cell lines and, in the presence of erythropoietin, stimulates the formation of macroscopic [corrected] erythroid and multilineage hematopoietic colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2113121713,"The c-kit proto-oncogene, the gene at the mouse W developmental locus, is one of a substantial group of genes that appear to encode cell surface receptors but for which the ligands are unknown. We have characterized the kit ligand by a generally applicable approach: the receptor extracellular domain was genetically fused to placental alkaline phosphatase, producing a soluble receptor affinity reagent with an enzyme tag that could be easilly and sensitively traced. This fusion protein, APtag-KIT, was used to demonstrate a specific binding interaction (KD = 3 × 10−8 M) with a ligand on 3T3 fibroblast lines. In situ staining showed labeling over the whole surface of the 3T3 cells, but not extending to adjacent nonexpressing cells. These findings provide direct molecular evidence that the kit ligand can exist as a cell surface protein. Binding was not detected on 3T3 fibroblasts carrying the steel (SI) mutation, confirming the biological significance of the binding activity and demonstrating that mutations at the SI locus affect the expression or structure of the kit ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2039067014,"Direct genomic sequencing revealed that cytosine residues known to have undergone a germ-line mutation in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene or somatic mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene were methylated in all normal human tissues analyzed. Thus, these mutations should be scored as transitions from 5-methylcytosine to thymine rather than from cytosine to thymine. Methylated cytosines occur exclusively at CpG dinucleotides, which, although markedly underrepresented in human DNA, are sites for more than 30 percent of all known disease-related point mutations. Thus, 5-methylcytosine functions as an endogenous mutagen and carcinogen in humans, in that methylation seems to increase the potential for mutation at cytosine residues at least by a factor of 10."
https://openalex.org/W1976321898,"Many spontaneous, chemical-induced, and radiation-induced dominant white spotting (W) and steel (Sl) mutations have been identified in the mouse. W and Sl mutations have similar phenotypic effects including deficiencies in pigment cells, germ cells, and blood cells, Numerous studies have suggested that W acts within the affected cell while Sl instead exerts its effects in the extracellular environment. Recent findings demonstrating that W encodes the c-kit proto-oncogene, a tyrosine kinase membrane receptor, have suggested that Sl encodes a ligand for c-kit. In the accompanying article we report the identification and purification of mast cell growth factor (MGF), a c-kit ligand. Here we describe the cloning of sequences encoding MGF. Furthermore, we show that Mgf maps near Sl in the distal region of mouse chromosome 10 and is deleted in a number of Sl alleles. These findings strongly support the notion that Sl encodes the mast cell growth factor."
https://openalex.org/W1995240556,"We have used retrovirus-mediated gene transfer to demonstrate complementation of the cystic fibrosis (CF) defect in vitro. Amphotropic retroviruses were used to transduce a functional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) cDNA into CFPAC-1, a pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line derived from a patient with CF that stably expresses the chloride transport abnormalities characteristic of CF. CFPAC-1 cells were exposed to control virus (PLJ) and CFTR-expressing virus (PLJ-CFTR); viral-transduced clones were isolated and subjected to molecular and physiologic analysis. RNA analysis detected a viral-derived CFTR transcript in all of the PLJ-CFTR clones that contained unrearranged proviral sequences. Agents that increase intracellular cAMP stimulated 125I efflux in PLJ-CFTR clones but not PLJ clones. Whole-cell patch-clamp performed on three responding clones showed that the anion efflux responses were due to cAMP stimulation of Cl conductance. Our findings indicate that expression of the normal CFTR gene confers cAMP-dependent Cl channel regulation on CF epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1523015364,"Primary and passaged human synovial fibroblasts isolated from rheumatoid pannus were treated with recombinant interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha or beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to determine the effects of these stimuli on the relative expression of stromelysin, collagenase, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP). The steady-state mRNA levels for these genes and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were determined on Northern blots. Immunoblot analyses of the conditioned media using monoclonal antibodies generated against recombinant human stromelysin, collagenase, or TIMP showed that protein levels reflected the corresponding steady-state mRNA levels. The results revealed that 1) stromelysin and collagenase were not always coordinately expressed; 2) IL-1 was more potent than TNF or PMA in the induction of stromelysin expression; 3) neither IL-1 nor TNF significantly affected TIMP expression; 4) PMA induced both metalloproteinase and TIMP expression; and 5) the combination of IL-1 plus TNF had a synergistic effect on stromelysin expression. Dose response and time course experiments demonstrated that the synergistic effect of IL-1 plus TNF occurred at saturating concentrations of each cytokine and lasted for 7 days. In summary, the ability of IL-1 and TNF to preferentially induce stromelysin and collagenase expression, versus TIMP, may define a pivotal role for these cytokines in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis."

https://openalex.org/W2076389722,"The monocyte-derived cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), are central regulators of the immune response, but the physiologic stimuli for their release remain largely undefined. Engagement of three monocyte glycoproteins, LFA-3, CD44, and CD45, by specific monoclonal antibodies immobilized on plastic induced TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta release. In addition, TNF-alpha was released when monocyte LFA-3 bound immobilized, purified CD2, which is its physiologic receptor. Thus, a receptor-ligand interaction that mediates cell-cell adhesion can transmit the necessary signals for the release of monokines."
https://openalex.org/W2046972996,"Human B lymphocytes localize and differentiate within the microenvironment of lymphoid germinal centers. A frozen section binding assay was developed for the identification of those molecules involved in the adhesive interactions between B cells and lymphoid follicles. Activated human B cells and B cell lines were found to selectively adhere to germinal centers. The VLA-4 molecule on the lymphocyte and the adhesion molecule INCAM-110, expressed on follicular dendritic cells, supported this interaction. This cellular interaction model can be used for the study of how B cells differentiate."
https://openalex.org/W1964607223,"Projection neurons that form part of the motor pathway for song control continue to be produced and to replace older projection neurons in adult canaries and zebra finches. This is shown by combining [3H]thymidine, a cell birth marker, and fluorogold, a retrogradely transported tracer of neuronal connectivity. Species and seasonal comparisons suggest that this process is related to the acquisition of perceptual or motor memories. The ability of an adult brain to produce and replace projection neurons should influence our thinking on brain repair."
https://openalex.org/W2051953163,"We describe the electrophysiological properties of acutely isolated type-1 astrocytes using a new “tissue print” dissociation procedure. Because the enzymes used did not destroy or modify the ion channels, and the cells retained many processes, the properties may reflect those in vivo. The types of ion channels in type-1 astrocytes changed rapidly during the first 10 postnatal days, when they attained their adult phenotype. This change was dependent on the presence of neurons. In culture, most of these channel types were not expressed, but a phenotype more typical of that in vivo could be induced by co-culture with neurons. The electrophysiological properties of astrocytes make some existing hypotheses of astrocyte function less likely."
https://openalex.org/W2012359823,"Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) are localized at high concentrations in the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. A peripheral membrane protein of Mr 43,000 (43K protein) is closely associated with AChRs and has been proposed to anchor receptors at postsynaptic sites. We have used the Xenopus oocyte expression system to test the idea that the 43K protein clusters AChRs. Mouse muscle AChRs expressed in oocytes after injection of RNA encoding receptor subunits are uniformly distributed in the surface membrane. Coinjection of AChR RNA and RNA encoding the mouse muscle 43K protein causes AChRs to form clusters of 0.5-1.5 microns diameter. AChR clustering is not a consequence of increased receptor expression in the surface membrane or nonspecific clustering of all membrane proteins. The 43K protein is colocalized with AChRs in clusters when the two proteins are expressed together and forms clusters of similar size even in the absence of AChRs. These results provide direct evidence that the 43K protein causes clustering of AChRs and suggest that regulation of 43K protein clustering may be a key step in neuromuscular synaptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1501975414,"In order to examine the control of expression of the gene coding for the brown fat specific uncoupling protein thermogenin (UCP), brown fat cells isolated as undifferentiated precursors from the interscapular brown adipose tissue of young mice were grown in culture. In these cells, it was possible by norepinephrine (NE) addition to induce specifically the expression of the UCP gene. The effect of NE was due to activation of transcription. The ability to express the UCP gene was maximal in cells around confluence; cell cultures younger or older than this showed a lower response. The response to NE showed a sharp optimum around 0.1 microM and was linear with time over the 4-h period studied. The presence of insulin or thyroid hormones facilitated the NE response. Pharmacological analysis of the adrenergic response indicated that UCP gene expression could be induced both via beta-receptors (probably beta 3) and via alpha 1-receptors; these effects were synergistic. It was concluded that it is possible to promote these precursor cells to advance to such a state of differentiation that they can demonstrate the selective feature of the brown fat cell, i.e. the ability to express UCP. The expression of the UCP gene is regulated via interacting adrenergic mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1578697356,"The action of 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A) on DNA synthesis was evaluated both in whole cells and in vitro. 9-beta-D-Arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine was converted to its 5'-triphosphate 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine 5'-triphosphate (F-ara-ATP) in cells and then incorporated into DNA in a self-limiting manner. More than 94% of the analogue was incorporated into DNA at the 3' termini, indicating a chain termination action. In vitro DNA primer extension experiments further revealed that F-ara-ATP compared with dATP for incorporation into the A site of the extending DNA strand. The incorporation of F-ara-AMP into DNA resulted in termination of DNA strand elongation. Human DNA polymerase alpha incorporated more F-ara-AMP into DNA than polymerase epsilon (proliferating cell nuclear antigen-independent DNA polymerase delta) and was more sensitive to inhibition by F-ara-ATP. On the other hand, DNA polymerase epsilon was able to excise the incorporated F-ara-AMP from DNA in vitro. The incorporation of F-ara-AMP into DNA was linearly correlated both with inhibition of DNA synthesis and with loss of clonogenicity; thus it may be the mechanism of cytotoxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1608870486,"Although the induction of heat shock proteins (HSP) has been studied extensively in cultured cells, comparatively few studies have examined their expression in vivo. In this report, mRNA expression of two HSP families, HSP70 and HSP27, was investigated in brain, liver, lung, and skin of rats exposed to elevated ambient temperatures. The time course and relative magnitude of the heat-induced expression for these two HSP differed between tissues of the same animal. Even within the same tissue, HSP70 and HSP27 displayed differential kinetics of induction. In brain, lung, and skin, induction of HSP70 was dependent on the duration and temperature of the heat stress. This induction was transient with maximal HSP70 expression occurring at 1 h and returning to baseline 3 h after removal of the animals from heat stress. In liver, HSP70 expression did not show a direct relationship with temperature conditions and maximal induction did not occur until 6 h after heat stress. Heat-induced HSP27 expression was dependent on time and temperature of exposure in lung and skin but not in brain and liver. These findings demonstrate that the heat shock response in vivo lacks much of the coordinate control of expression characteristic of cultured cell populations and suggest that mechanisms controlling this cellular stress response are influenced by physiologic factors that cannot be studied in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2070649826,Regulation of bgl operon expression in E. coli occurs by a mechanism involving antitermination of transcription at two termination sites within the operon. The bglG gene product is absolutely required for this process. Here we provide evidence that BglG is an RNA binding protein that recognizes a specific sequence located just upstream of each of the terminators. The sequence was delimited using a series of specific oligonucleotide probes. Mutational analysis of this sequence indicates that the protein requires a specific RNA secondary structure for recognition. We propose that BglG prevents transcription termination by binding to nascent RNA and blocking formation of the terminator structure.
https://openalex.org/W1511750039,"Earlier studies indicate that parathyroid hormone (PTH) enhances insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) synthesis in primary osteoblast-enriched fetal rat cell cultures and the stimulatory effect of PTH on bone collagen synthesis is mediated at least in part by IGF-I. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a second messenger for signal transduction by PTH to its target cells, although calcium may also serve this function. We now demonstrate that isobutylmethylxanthine, forskolin, and dibutyryl cAMP, agents that elevate intracellular cAMP levels by discrete mechanisms, also enhanced the steady state transcript and polypeptide level of IGF-I in osteoblast-enriched cultures. The calcium ionophore ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate did not increase IGF-I synthesis. In contrast, none of the agents tested increased the steady state transcript or polypeptide levels for IGF-II. The rat IGF-I gene is greater than 90 kilobases in length, and contains at least three promoter regions. Our present data represent the first demonstration of cAMP mediated IGF-I gene regulation and indicate the potential for preferential promoter usage for modulating IGF-I gene expression in bone."
https://openalex.org/W1504758596,"We have isolated a cell surface proteoglycan from a human mammary cell line (HBL-100). This proteoglycan was found to be a human equivalent to mouse syndecan, because (i) it has identical biochemical properties with murine syndecan, including size, charge, buoyant density, and glycosaminoglycan composition, (ii) its core protein has identical size with murine syndecan as studied by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and (iii) the core protein is detected with anti-peptide antibody for the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan. HBL-100 cells also showed high expression of syndecan mRNAs, when probed with mouse syndecan cDNA. The ectodomain of the human syndecan revealed binding to type I collagen fibrils and fibronectin but not to laminin, duplicating the binding properties of murine syndecan. Very interestingly, syndecan did not bind to vitronectin, which is known to contain a heparin binding domain and is one of the major adhesive factors of serum for cultured cells. Syndecans are known to change their glycosaminoglycan composition yielding tissue-type specific polymorphic forms of syndecan (Sanderson, R., and Bernfield, M. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 85, 9562-9566). The members of this family may thus represent a collection of structurally related matrix receptors that could differ in their interactions due to variation of the ectodomain glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1546177497,"The cDNAs encoding two major subunits, named YC1 and YC7-alpha, of yeast proteasomes (multicatalytic proteinase complexes) were isolated and sequenced. As deduced from their nucleotide sequences, YC1 and YC7-alpha consist of 288 and 252 amino acid residues with calculated molecular weights of 31,534 and 27,999, respectively. They showed marked sequence homology to other eukaryotic proteasome components, suggesting that proteasomes are composed of a family of subunits with the same evolutional origin. To obtain information on the physiological role of proteasomes, we disrupted the chromosomal genes of YC1 and YC7-alpha of yeast cells independently, using isolated cDNA clones. Disruption of the coding region of one copy of the YC1 gene in diploid yeast created a recessive lethal mutation, but disruption of the 3'-noncoding region of the gene had no effect on cell proliferation. Disruption of the YC7-alpha gene also had a lethal effect on haploid yeast cells. These findings demonstrated that YC1 and YC7-alpha are both encoded by a single copy gene and that these genes are essential for proliferation of yeast cells."

https://openalex.org/W1583472754,"A culture system for 3T3-L1 preadipocytes based on a serum-free chemically defined medium containing fetuin, transferrin, and pantothenate is described. In this system, adipose conversion depends on the following conditions. 1) In the presence of high insulin concentrations (1 microM), addition of corticosterone together with 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (MIX) for not more than the first 4 days after confluence to the culture medium induces maximal adipose conversion within 12-14 days. MIX may be replaced by forskolin or permeable analogues of cAMP, indicating that its effect is due to elevated cellular cAMP levels. 2) At low insulin concentrations (1 nM), adipose conversion is reduced. Growth hormone or insulin-like growth factor I together with epidermal growth factor have to be present as a medium supplement together with corticosterone and MIX to get maximal adipose conversion. 3) The induction of adipose conversion by corticosterone and MIX in the presence of either high insulin concentrations or insulin-like growth factor I together with epidermal growth factor is accompanied by post-confluent mitoses. Inhibitors of DNA replication markedly reduce adipose conversion. Fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, although acting as potent mitogens on 3T3-L1 cells, do not support adipose conversion induced by corticosterone and MIX."
https://openalex.org/W190940606,"Sustained generation of alpha-thrombin and its breakdown forms at sites of thromboses has focused attention on the roles thrombin may play in vascular responses to thrombosis and injury. We have previously shown that alpha-thrombin stimulates many growth signals in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMC). To characterize thrombin growth mechanisms, we studied the effects on cultured VSMC of gamma-thrombin (catalytically active with obstructed anion-binding site required for clotting activity) and D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethylketone-alpha-thrombin (catalytically inactive with intact anion-binding exosite) on cultured VSMC. Either derivative alone failed to increase growth, but in combination at 130 nM each, they caused a 75 +/- 5% increase in protein synthesis, similar to that observed with alpha-thrombin. This increase in protein synthesis was related to activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and Na+/H+ exchange, because only in combination could the derivatives increase phosphorylation of a 76,000-dalton PKC substrate and alkalinize the cells. Activation of PKC was correlated with a synergistic effect of the derivatives on diacylglycerol formation at 2 min (maximum, 55 +/- 1% combined increase vs. 24 +/- 9% and 4 +/- 4% individual increases with gamma- and D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethylketone-alpha-thrombin alone, respectively, p less than 0.05). The derivatives stimulated PKC without increasing inositol trisphosphate, intracellular Ca2+, or expression of the protooncogene, c-fos. Thus, thrombin stimulation of Na+/H+ exchange, diacylglycerol formation, and growth of VSMC can be distinguished from thrombin mobilization of [Ca2+]i and induction of c-fos mRNA. These data indicate the presence of more than one mechanism for thrombin-mediated signaling events in cultured VSMC. Our results also suggest that various thrombin forms retained in clots may have significant effects on VSMC growth and function."
https://openalex.org/W2011887614,"Heart rate is determined by pacemaker currents, of which the most important is the hyperpolarization-activated current If. Heart rate and If are increased by β-adrenergic agonists and decreased by muscarinic agonists released from cardiac sympathetic and vagal nerves, respectively. The hypothesis that the receptors for each agonist are directly coupled to If channels by G proteins was tested. Under substrate-free conditions, preactivated G protein Gs stimulated and preactivated G protein Go inhibited If channels of sinoatrial node pacemaker cells. These effects were mimicked by the corresponding preactivated α subunits of the G proteins. Unexpectedly, the two G proteins acted simultaneously, with Go being the more potent. This result may explain in molecular terms the classical observation in cardiac physiology, that vagal inhibition of heart rate is much greater on a background of sympathetic stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1607867087,"In the present study we examined the effect of carboxyl-terminal modifications of des-Met14-bombesin (Bn) on Bn receptor affinity in murine 3T3 cells, rat and guinea pig pancreatic acini, and the ability to initiate biologic responses by synthesizing 18 des-Met14-Bn(6-13) analogues. With guinea pig acini and 3T3 cells, affinity was affected by the chain length of the alkyl moiety (R) added to [D-Phe6]Bn(6-13)NH2R with relative potencies: propyl greater than ethyl greater than butyl = hexyl greater than heptyl greater than free amide, whereas in rat acini affinity was not increased by the chain length. In each cell system the affinity of the alkylamide was not increased by insertion of a phenyl group in the alkyl side chain, by making the analogue more neuromedin B-like or by addition of a reduced peptide bond. The affinity in each cell system was increased by additions of other electron releasing groups to the COOH-terminal carboxyl group such as [D-Phe6]Bn(6-13)ethyl or methyl ester, or hydrazide. In guinea pig pancreas and 3T3 cells, 12 analogues were antagonists, 1 a full and 5 partial agonists. In rat pancreas, 8 were antagonists, 5 full agonists, and 5 partial agonists. Potent antagonists in each cell system were the methyl and ethyl ester, hydrazide, and ethylamide analogues. In 3T3 cells or guinea pig pancreas, agonist activity of the alkylamide was critically dependent on the chain length, whereas with rat pancreatic Bn receptors any alkylamide longer than the ethylamide had agonist activity. In all three cell systems any alteration that made the alkylamide more neuromedin B-like caused agonist activity. These results demonstrate that the nature of the substitution on the carboxyl terminus of des-Met14-Bn analogues is critically important, not only for determining Bn receptor affinity, but also for determining the ability to initiate a biologic response. In contrast to previous studies, the present results demonstrate that the presence of the COOH-terminal amino acid in position 14 of Bn is not essential for initiating a biologic response. Several des-Met14-Bn analogues were potent partial agonists, whereas others such as the hydrazide or ethyl ester are very potent antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1648195462,"The involvement of G-proteins in the insulin signal transduction system has been studied in detail using the murine BC3H-1 myocyte system. Pertussis toxin (PT) treatment, previously shown to attenuate some of the metabolic effects of insulin in this cell line (Luttrell, L.M., Hewlett, E.L., Romero, G., and Rogol, A.D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6134-6141), abolished insulin-induced generation of diacylglycerol and inositolglycan mediators with no effects on either the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor or the phosphorylation of the major endogenous substrates for insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity (pp185 and pp42-45). In vitro ADP-ribosylation and immunoblotting studies suggest that the major PT substrate is a 40-kDa protein of the G alpha family. This protein band did not exhibit detectable tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation of either intact cells or cell membranes with insulin. In the presence of low concentrations of GTP, insulin treatment of isolated myocyte plasma membranes resulted in a small (30-40%) but significant stimulation of GTP hydrolysis. This effect was best observed in the presence of small concentrations of sodium dodecyl sulfate. The rate of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) binding to BC3H-1 membranes was also significantly increased in the presence of insulin. The effects of insulin on GTP hydrolysis and GTP gamma S binding were found to be dependent on the concentration of insulin. These effects were not detected in plasma membranes prepared from PT-pretreated BC3H-1 myocytes. In contrast, pretreatment with the B (inactive) subunit of PT did not alter the response of myocyte membranes to insulin. High affinity binding of [125I]iodoinsulin to myocyte plasma membranes was reduced by 60-70% in the presence of guanine nucleotides. Similar effects on insulin binding were produced by PT pretreatment of the cells. In contrast, adenine nucleotides had no effect on insulin binding. Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed that the observed effects of guanine nucleotides and PT on insulin binding resulted either from a reduction in the number of high affinity insulin binding sites or from a significant reduction of the affinity of insulin for its receptor. Low affinity binding sites did not appear to be affected by either guanine nucleotides nor PT pretreatment. These results provide substantial evidence suggestive of a noncovalent interaction between the insulin receptor and a regulatory G-protein system during the process of insulin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1602607306,"Charybdotoxin (ChTX), a potent peptidyl inhibitor of several types of K+ channels, binds to sites in vascular smooth muscle sarcolemma (Vazquez, J., Feigenbaum, P., Katz, G. M., King, V. F., Reuben, J. P., Roy-Contancin, L., Slaughter, R. S., Kaczorowski, G. J., and Garcia, M. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 20902-20909) which are functionally associated with a high conductance Ca2(+)-activated K+ channel (PK,Ca). 125I-ChTX also binds specifically and reversibly to a single class of sites in plasma membranes prepared from rat brain synaptosomes. These sites exhibit a Kd of 25-30 pM, as measured by either equilibrium or kinetic binding protocols and display a maximum density of about 0.3-0.5 pmol/mg of protein. Competition studies with native ChTX yield a Ki of 8 pM for the noniodinated toxin. The highest density of ChTX sites exists in vesicle fractions of plasma membrane origin. Binding of 125I-ChTX is modulated by metal ions that interact with K+ channels: Ba2+, Ca2+, and Cs+ cause inhibition of ChTX binding; Na+ and K+ stimulate binding at low concentration before producing complete inhibition as their concentration is increased. Stimulation of binding is due to an allosteric interaction that decreases Kd whereas inhibition results from an ionic strength effect. Tetraethylammonium ion has no effect on binding, but tetrabutylammonium ion blocks binding with a Ki of 2.5 mM. Different toxins (i.e. alpha-dendrotoxin, noxiustoxin) that inhibit an inactivating, voltage-dependent K+ channel (PK,V) block 125I-ChTX binding in brain. In marked contrast, iberiotoxin, a selective inhibitor of PK,Ca, has no effect on ChTX binding in this preparation. Inhibition of ChTX binding by alpha-dendrotoxin and noxiustoxin results from an allosteric interaction between separate binding sites for these agents and the ChTX receptor. Taken together, these results suggest that the ChTX sites present in brain are associated with PK,V rather than with PK,Ca. Therefore, 125I-ChTX is a useful probe for elucidating the biochemical properties of a number of different types of K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1533120728,"We have recently reported a characterization of cDNA clones that encode an apparently novel human collagen that undergoes alternative splicing. These cDNAs covered one-third of the corresponding 2.5-2.8-kilobase mRNAs. We have now determined the complete primary structure of the protein encoded by several overlapping cDNAs isolated from a human endothelial cell library. Since the deduced translation product of the cDNAs is different in structure from all other collagen types, we have given the collagen chain encoded by the cDNAs the designation alpha 1 (XIII). The deduced polypeptide consists of three collagenous domains and four noncollagenous domains, two of them separating the collagenous domains and two located at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the polypeptide. Cysteine residues are found in three of the noncollagenous domains and also in the extreme N-terminal collagenous domain. Surprisingly, comparison of the nucleotide sequences encoded by the overlapping cDNA clones demonstrates that there are several alpha 1 (XIII) collagen mRNAs in HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells and human endothelial cells which differ in coding potential. Nuclease S1 mapping experiments suggest that these different mRNAs arise through alternative splicing of the precursor RNA at five locations within the coding region. This property makes type XIII collagen unique among all the collagen types studied so far. Its polypeptide length, therefore, may vary between 614 and 526 amino acids, depending on what internal splicing has taken place."
https://openalex.org/W1508038988,"Covalent binding of proteinases by human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) results primarily from the formation of stable epsilon-Lys-gamma-Glu isopeptide bonds. Cross-linking engages 12, 13, and 10 of the 14, 14, and 11 Lys residues in chymotrypsin, trypsin, and subtilisin, respectively, and reaction with the alpha-amino group of the C-chain of chymotrypsin and the B-chain of beta-trypsin is also seen. In contrast, cross-linking engages only 6 of the 11 Lys residues in thermolysin. In each of these proteinases, a few residues react to the greatest extent: Lys36, Lys79, Lys87, and Lys93 in chymotrypsin; Lys87, Lys109, Lys222, and Lys239 in trypsin; Lys12, Lys43, and Lys141 in subtilisin; and Lys210 and Lys219 in thermolysin. In elastase, 1 of the 3 Lys residues (Lys87) is tentatively identified as being cross-linked. Formation of unstable bonds judged to be mainly p-tyrosyl-gamma-glutamyl esters can also be significant for some proteinases. In each of the proteinases, several of the strongly reacting Lys residues are located relatively close to each other, presumably reflecting steric constraints within the alpha 2M-proteinase complexes as they form. Proteinases are covalently bound to alpha 2M to one or two of its COOH-terminal bait region-cleaved half-subunits. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis pattern of the high molecular weight cross-linked species indicates that binding of a proteinase through two cross-links occurs not only within the 360-kDa disulfide-bridged alpha 2M dimer but also between the two dimers in the alpha 2M tetramer."
https://openalex.org/W1511224003,"The epitope for monoclonal antibody A20 was mapped to amino acids 870-890 of the Ca2(+)-ATPase of rabbit fast-twitch skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum. The antibody did not react with the epitope in intact sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles but reacted with the epitope when the vesicles were solubilized with the detergent C12E8 or made permeable by incubation in a hypotonic medium. By contrast, antibody A52, which binds to a cytoplasmic epitope consisting of amino acids 657-672, reacted with the Ca2(+)-ATPase in vesicular, permeabilized vesicular, and C12E8-solubilized states. These results clearly demonstrate that antibody A20 binds to a luminal epitope and provide the first demonstration that a specific segment of the Ca2(+)-ATPase is located on the luminal surface of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These results are consistent with, and support, our model for folding of the Ca2(+)-ATPase (Brandl, C. J., Korczak, B., Green, N. M., and MacLennan, D. H. (1986) Cell 44, 597-607) in which residues 657-672 were proposed to form part of the cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain, while residues 870-890 were proposed to form a luminal loop between proposed transmembrane sequences M7 and M8."
https://openalex.org/W1507610549,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) stimulated the synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycan in cultured human colon carcinoma cells without affecting its rates of intracellular degradation or secretion. The overall hydrodynamic size, electrophoretic mobility, and degree of sulfation of the TGF-beta-induced proteoglycan was indistinguishable from that of untreated cells. The synthesis of the protein core was significantly stimulated by TGF-beta, although total cellular protein was unaltered. The stimulatory effects of TGF-beta were prevented by the inhibitors of protein synthesis and DNA transcription, cycloheximide, or actinomycin D, respectively. Analysis of protein core mRNA levels using a murine cDNA encoding a basement membrane protein core, revealed a marked elevation of the steady state levels of mRNA for this gene product. In contrast, the mRNA levels for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or beta-actin genes were not significantly affected by TGF-beta. Finally, nuclear run-off experiments showed increases in neither protein core-specific transcription nor in general transcriptional activity. Taken together, these results indicate that TGF-beta is a potent modulator of heparan sulfate proteoglycan expression in human colon carcinoma cells and that its effect is mediated primarily through an increase in mRNA levels encoding the protein core, perhaps a result of enhanced RNA stability. The TGF-beta-induced elevation of heparan sulfate proteoglycan may contribute to the control of stromal cell proliferation and matrix production by human colon carcinoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W1547924576,"Previous studies revealed that antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to specific regions of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) are potent inhibitors of replication of HIV-1 in vitro (Zamecnik, P. C., Goodchild, J., Taguchi, Y., and Sarin, P. S. (1986) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 83, 4143-4146). We now report that antisense RNA, synthesized in vitro using T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase, displayed an anti-HIV-1 effect in the HTLV-IIIB/H9 system in vitro. Treatment of HIV-1-infected H9 cells with viral env region antisense RNA encapsulated in liposomes targeted by antibodies specific for the T cell receptor molecule CD3 almost completely inhibited HIV-1 production. The viral env segment covered a part of exon II of HIV-1 tat gene. No anti-HIV activity could be detected with similarly targeted liposome-encapsulated sense env RNA or with pol RNA synthesized in either the sense or antisense orientations, or with env region antisense RNA free in solution, or encapsulated in liposomes in the absence of the targeting antibody. A semiquantitative evaluation revealed that 4000-7000 RNA molecules became cell-bound in targeted liposomes; the half-life of the intracellularly present hybridizable antisense env RNA was approximately 12 h. Western blots showed that antisense env RNA suppressed tat gene expression by approximately 90% and gp160 production by 100%. These data were confirmed by immunoprecipitation studies. Northern blots (using an env probe) demonstrated the existence of all major HIV RNA species (9.3-, 4.3-, and 2.0-kb mRNA) in HIV-infected cells treated with antisense env RNA although at a reduced level. We conclude that the antisense env RNA inhibited viral protein production at the translational level."
https://openalex.org/W1569582000,"The gene encoding the human basal histone variant H2A.Z has been cloned and sequenced. There is a single functional H2A.Z gene with several pseudogene copies. No other histone genes were found in the 3 kilobases of upstream sequence or in the 0.7 kilobase of downstream sequence. In the upstream region, there are regions of Alu sequences, located about 1375 and 2650 base pairs before the transcription start site. The amount of the H2A.Z transcript is unlinked to DNA replication; however, the amount of the H2A.Z transcript is greatly decreased as proliferating cell cultures become quiescent due in part to a decrease in the rate of transcription. Promoter sequences upstream from the H2A.Z gene have been delineated in IMR-90 cells by chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression. Maximal promoter activity was found in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase construct that contained 234 base pairs just upstream from the transcription start site. This region includes two GC boxes and three CCAAT boxes as well as a properly positioned TATA box. The organization of the human gene is similar to that of the recently characterized chicken gene (Dalton, S., Robins, A. J., Harvey, R. P., and Wells, J. R. E. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 17, 1745-1756). Both have four introns with identical exon-intron borders, but three of the introns in the chicken gene are much longer than those in the human. The promoter regions of the two genes have little overall homology; however, two GC boxes and one of the CCAAT boxes are conserved."
https://openalex.org/W1635327066,"Rates of nucleosome formation on DNA with various superhelical topologies were determined using an in vitro deposition system. The core histones, H3, H2B, H2A, and H4 were reconstituted with polyglutamic acid (a deposition vehicle) and added to closed-circular DNAs. Aliquots were taken during the incubation, added to excess topoisomerase I, and incubated for 20 s to determine the number of negative coils constrained into nucleosome structure by the histones. When negatively supercoiled DNA was used, nucleosomes were formed virtually instantaneously in a temperature-independent process with all the negative coils being trapped into nucleosome structure. When relaxed DNA (no negative coils) was used, nucleosome formation was severely retarded. If topoisomerase I was maintained in the total incubation of histones with the relaxed DNA, nucleosome formation occurred with a measurable rate in a temperature-dependent process (activation energy of 17 kcal/mol). Similar observations were made when the method of reconstitution of histones with DNA involved salt gradient dialysis. The data indicates that the lack of preformed negative coils is a rate-limiting step in nucleosome formation and that when positive coils are also maintained within the circular DNA, these positive coils prevent nucleosome formation. The effect of DNA topology on nucleosome formation is discussed with regard to its physiological relevance in replication and transcription processes."
https://openalex.org/W1511964476,"The effects of diphenylbutylpiperidine (DPBP) antipsychotics on Ca2+ currents and prolactin (PRL) synthesis were studied in rat pituitary growth hormone (GH) cell lines (GH3 and GH4C1). In whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, DPBPs including fluspirilene, penfluridol, and pimozide at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 5 microM each blocked current through low threshold T-type as well as high threshold L-type channels. Each of the drugs preferentially blocked T-type current, and complete inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 1 microM. Inhibition of L-type channels by DPBPS was enhanced at depolarized holding potentials and promoted by prolonged channel activation. At concentrations similar to those which blocked Ca2+ currents, each of the three DPBPs markedly reduced basal PRL production by GH cells. PRL synthesis stimulated by the dihydropyridine Ca2+ agonist R5417 or thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) was also inhibited. The inhibitory effects of the DPBPs were observed at the level of gene transcription. Penfluridol and fluspirilene inhibited basal, Ca2(+)- and TRH-stimulated expression of a fusion gene construct containing the 5'-flanking sequence of the rat PRL gene linked to the luciferase gene. The effect was concentration-dependent with the IC50 values for both drugs of less than 1 microM. Nimodipine also reduced basal, R5417, and TRH-stimulated expression of the reporter gene construct. Similar results were obtained with a reporter gene construct containing the 5'-flanking sequence of the rat GH gene. The GH luciferase construct was only slightly responsive to R5417 and TRH; however, these responses were reduced by fluspirilene and nimodipine at concentrations of less than 1 microM. These studies demonstrate that the DPBP antipsychotics block T- as well as L-type Ca2+ channels in GH cells and inhibit PRL production at the level of transcription. They also indicate that functioning Ca2+ channels are necessary for TRH-stimulated PRL gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1534857296,"The temperature-sensitive cell cycle mutation bimE7 of Aspergillus nidulans causes cells to become blocked in mitosis at a restrictive temperature. Previous work has shown that this mitotic block is induced even when cells are arrested in the S or G2 phase. The mitotic block is also observed in cells carrying a null mutation in bimE, obtained by molecular disruption of the gene (Osmani, S.A., Engle, D.B., Doonan, J.H., and Morris, N.R. (1988) Cell 52, 241-251), indicating that a lack of bimE function is responsible for the phenotype. We have cloned the bimE gene by complementation of the mutant phenotype and have isolated and sequenced its corresponding cDNA. The gene product is encoded by a 6.5-7-kilobase mRNA. The deduced amino acid sequence suggests a protein with three transmembrane domains. The sequence contains numerous potential N-glycosylation sites and several putative cAMP-dependent phosphorylation sites. No homologous protein sequences were found in the common data bases. The bimE gene product is a novel component in the regulation of mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W1895087506,"An expression vector (pU3R-III/2-5AS) of human 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetase was constructed in which a cDNA encoding an active form of the enzyme was located 3' to a 3'-long terminal repeat (LTR) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). The LTR-directed expression of this hybrid DNA could be activated in trans by the HIV tat gene product. This vector was used for transfection of HeLa-T4+ cells, which are permissive to HIV infection, as well as of normal HeLa cells. HIV replication after infection of the CD4-receptor-bearing HeLa-T4+ cells with HIV-1 was found to be strongly reduced when drug-selected cells cotransfected with pU3R-III/2-5AS and a hygromycin B resistance gene containing plasmid were used. In non-transfected cultures or after transfection with the selectable marker plasmid only, about 60% p17- and p24-positive cells were found 5 days after infection. However, after stable transfection with pU3R-III/2-5AS the number of positive cells was decreased to about 2%. The reverse transcriptase (RT) activity, as a measure for virus production, was markedly decreased in the culture fluids of pU3R-III/2-5AS transfected cells compared with the mock-transfected controls. In parallel experiments it was established that Tat-mediated trans-activation of HIV-1 LTR-directed 2-5A synthetase expression resulted in a great increase in both 2-5A synthetase mRNA level and activity as well as in cellular 2-5A content. Similar results were found in HeLa-T4+ cells and in HeLa cells (without CD4 receptor) cotransfected with pU3R-III/2-5AS and a tat gene containing plasmid or after introduction of purified Tat protein into the pU3R-III/2-5AS transfected cells by using a modified scrape loading procedure. These results indicate that HIV-trans-activated 2-5A synthetase can selectively inhibit HIV replication in vitro, and might be a promising gene therapeutical approach.— Schröder, H. C.; Ugarkovic, D.; Merz, H.; Kuchino, Y.; Okamoto, T.; Müller, W. E. G.

https://openalex.org/W1550818941,"The orientation of cytochrome b6 in the thylakoid membrane and the question of whether the number of membrane spanning helices is an even or odd number was tested through the relative trypsin susceptibility of epitopes (Asp-5 to Gln-14) and (Ile-205 to Leu-214) at the NH2 and COOH termini, respectively, of the 214-residue cytochrome b6 polypeptide. A structure of the cytochrome with an even number of helices and the NH2 and COOH termini on the stromal side of the membrane was inferred from the following: 1) cleavage of cytochrome b6 by trypsin added to thylakoids occurs by removal of both of the exposed NH2- and COOH-terminal epitopes. The epitopes at the termini were more sensitive to trypsin after prior treatment of thylakoids with carboxypeptidase A, indicating that these epitopes are shielded on the stromal side of the membrane by the COOH termini of other proteins. 2) Both epitopes were more trypsin-sensitive in thylakoid membranes than was cytochrome f that is only sensitive to trypsin acting on the lumen side of the membrane. 3) The NH2- and COOH-terminal epitopes of cytochrome b6 were also more sensitive to trypsin added to thylakoid membranes than were the oxygen-evolving complex 16- and 33-kDa proteins that are completely located on the lumen side. 4) The order of trypsin susceptibility was reversed in inside-out membranes, where the cytochrome NH2- and COOH-terminal epitopes were less sensitive than the 16- and 33-kDa proteins. The decreased relative sensitivity of the cytochrome b6 epitopes occurs in spite of a greater absolute sensitivity of these epitopes to trypsin in inside-out membranes. 5) The greater absolute sensitivity can be explained by a 4-helix model that includes trypsin-sensitive sites on the lumen side."
https://openalex.org/W1596659376,"Alpha 1-Microglobulin (alpha 1-m), or protein HC, a low molecular weight plasma protein with immunoregulatory properties, was isolated from rat serum by affinity chromatography using Sepharose-coupled monoclonal anti-alpha 1-m antibodies. High molecular weight forms of alpha 1-m were then separated from the low molecular weight alpha 1-m by gel chromatography of the eluted proteins. The apparent Mr (28,000), the charge heterogeneity, the N-linked carbohydrate, and yellow-brown chromophore suggest that the low molecular weight alpha 1-m is the serum counterpart to urinary alpha 1-m, which was purified previously. A high molecular weight complex of alpha 1-m was also isolated by the gel chromatography. It was homogeneous as judged by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecule was bound by antibodies against human alpha 2-macroglobulin, and experiments with antisera against the three alpha-macroglobulin variants in rat serum, alpha 1-macroglobulin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and alpha 1-inhibitor-3 (alpha 1I3) suggested that alpha 1I3 was the complex-partner of alpha 1-m. An antiserum raised against high molecular weight alpha 1-m was then used to isolate the complex-partner of alpha 1-m from rat serum with affinity chromatography, and this molecule was positively identified as alpha 1I3 by its physicochemical properties. Gel chromatography of the alpha 1I3.alpha 1-m complex suggested a molecule with an Mr of 266,000. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, however, it migrated as three major molecular species with apparent molecular weights of 224,000, 205,000, and 194,000 and several minor species of both higher and lower molecular weights, suggesting a complex subunit structure. alpha 1-m and alpha 1I3 could be detected in all three major species by Western blotting, and NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing suggested a molar ratio of 1:1 of alpha 1-m and alpha 1I3 in all three species. alpha 1I3.alpha 1-m was colorless, did not show light absorbance beyond 300 nm which is typical of low molecular weight alpha 1-m and was electrophoretically homogeneous, suggesting that it lacks the chromophore. Finally, the serum concentrations of the alpha 1I3.alpha 1-m complex and free alpha 1-m were determined as 0.16 and 0.010 g/liter, respectively. Thus, alpha 1I3.alpha 1-m constitutes 1-3% of the total alpha 1I3 in rat serum (w/w) and approximately 60% of the total alpha 1-m."

The pK determined from a titration curve was 6.5 with a slope greater than 1, indicating protonation of several histidines. The reduction in membrane current was voltage-independent. The affinity of the agonist for the receptor, the single-channel conductance, and the open time were unaffected by [H+]o· [H+]o antagonism was not the result of charge neutralization such as screening surface charge. Diethylpyrocarbonate, a histidine-modifying reagent, reduced the agonist-induced current, but disulfide- and sulfhydryl-modifying reagents were ineffective.

https://openalex.org/W1596319967,"Removal of bound magnesium from the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane opens up a Na+ and Li+ selective electrophoretic uniport pathway whereas simultaneous depletion of intramitochondrial magnesium induces an electrogenic K+ flux as well. In order to clarify the nature of these cation movements we tested the effect of ruthenium red, a potent and specific inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter on different Na+ and K+ uniport-associated phenomena. Ruthenium red efficiently inhibited mitochondrial swelling and depolarization induced by either EDTA in a NaCl-based medium (Na+ uniport) or by EDTA plus A23187 in a KCl-based medium (K+ uniport). For both cation uniports half-maximal inhibition was attained at a ruthenium red concentration as low as 40 nM. Complete inhibition was found above 200 nM. Neither the Na+/H+ nor the K+/H+ exchange was affected by ruthenium red. In light of these observations the possibility is raised that the electrogenic Na+ and K+ fluxes provoked by magnesium reduction or depletion may be mediated through the Ca2+ uniporter. It is suggested that intactness of the mitochondrial magnesium pools is necessary for maintaining the Ca2+ selectivity of the Ca2+ uniporter, and alterations of the membrane-associated magnesium content would make this transport route available also for monovalent cations."
https://openalex.org/W1587631451,"Mouse satellite DNA consists of highly repetitive tandem sequences located in the centromeric heterochromatin. It is generally assumed that these simple sequences are not transcribed. We have analyzed total cellular RNA preparations from mouse liver, kidney, brain, and heart tissues at different ages for satellite transcripts. Using recombinant probes containing the major mouse satellite sequence, satellite transcripts were detected only in the heart RNA samples. These transcripts were not detected in the heart muscle of young adult animals (2 and 6 months), but then appeared at the age of 12 months and continued to increase over 2-fold up to the age of 32 months. The transcripts were resistant to DNase I and sensitive to RNases and alkaline treatment. Northern hybridization experiments showed a large and heterogeneous size range of satellite transcripts. Control studies using short-interspersed (B1 and B2) and long-interspersed (L1 and IAP) repetitive DNA sequence probes did not show a similar age-related pattern of transcription. These results indicate that satellite transcription does occur in mice but is highly tissue- and age-specific. The unique occurrence of satellite transcription only in adult and senescent heart tissue indicates age to be an important determinant of gene activity. An understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved could lead to new insights in the biological role of satellite DNA, gene derepression of reiterated DNA sequences, and the aging processes of cardiac muscle."

They are important in such diverse functions as neurotransmitter release, muscle excitability, pancreatic secretion, and cell volume regulation. Although much is known about the biophysics of Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels, the molecular structure, cDNA and amino acid sequences are unknown. We injected size-fractionated mRNA isolated from cultured rabbit kidney medullary thick ascending limb cells in Xenopus oocytes and observed newly expressed K+ currents using two-microelectrode voltage-clamp technique. The expressed K+ currents are Ca2+ dependent and inhibited by charybdotoxin, a specific blocker of Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels. Amplitudes of the current ranged from 30 nA to more than 1 microA at a membrane potential of +30 mV. Reversal potential of the current suggested a K(+)-selective channel. The peak activity of Ca2(+)-activated K+ channels were observed in fractions corresponding to a message RNA with size of approximately 4.5 kilobases."

Although the limited amount of fusion protein transported to the cell surface is glycophospholipid-anchored, most of the protein accumulates in an intracellular, endoglycosidase H-sensitive form. The intracellular protein has an unusual structure that contains ethanolamine but does not bind detergent, suggesting either that anchor addition proceeds via a hydrophilic partial intermediate, or that anchor-degradative enzymes exist along the secretory path."
