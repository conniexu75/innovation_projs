However, the mechanisms by which ångström-scale molecular properties are translated to micrometre-scale macroscopic properties are not well understood. Here we show that interactions between diverse synthetic, multivalent macromolecules (including multi-domain proteins and RNA) produce sharp liquid-liquid-demixing phase separations, generating micrometre-sized liquid droplets in aqueous solution. This macroscopic transition corresponds to a molecular transition between small complexes and large, dynamic supramolecular polymers. The concentrations needed for phase transition are directly related to the valency of the interacting species. In the case of the actin-regulatory protein called neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) interacting with its established biological partners NCK and phosphorylated nephrin, the phase transition corresponds to a sharp increase in activity towards an actin nucleation factor, the Arp2/3 complex. The transition is governed by the degree of phosphorylation of nephrin, explaining how this property of the system can be controlled to regulatory effect by kinases. The widespread occurrence of multivalent systems suggests that phase transitions may be used to spatially organize and biochemically regulate information throughout biology."

https://openalex.org/W2006233420,"The biogeochemical cycles of iron and organic carbon are strongly interlinked. In oceanic waters, organic ligands have been shown to control the concentration of dissolved iron. In soils, solid iron phases shelter and preserve organic carbon, but the role of iron in the preservation of organic matter in sediments has not been clearly established. Here we use an iron reduction method previously applied to soils to determine the amount of organic carbon associated with reactive iron phases in sediments of various mineralogies collected from a wide range of depositional environments. Our findings suggest that 21.5 ± 8.6 per cent of the organic carbon in sediments is directly bound to reactive iron phases. We further estimate that a global mass of (19-45) × 10(15) grams of organic carbon is preserved in surface marine sediments as a result of its association with iron. We propose that these associations between organic carbon and iron, which are formed primarily through co-precipitation and/or direct chelation, promote the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. Because reactive iron phases are metastable over geological timescales, we suggest that they serve as an efficient 'rusty sink' for organic carbon, acting as a key factor in the long-term storage of organic carbon and thus contributing to the global cycles of carbon, oxygen and sulphur."

https://openalex.org/W2100446975,"The Petunia hybrida ABC transporter PDR1 functions in strigolactone export from the roots and is important for regulating symbiosis and axillary branch development. The strigolactones are plant hormones that regulate shoot branching; they are required for the establishment of widespread plant–fungus symbionts known as mycorrhizae. Here, Kretzschmar et al. report the discovery of a strigolactone transporter protein. The ABC transporter PDR1 from Petunia hybrida is required for the regulation of shoot branching, mycorrhization and interactions with parasitic weeds. Strigolactones were originally identified as stimulators of the germination of root-parasitic weeds1 that pose a serious threat to resource-limited agriculture2. They are mostly exuded from roots and function as signalling compounds in the initiation of arbuscular mycorrhizae3, which are plant–fungus symbionts with a global effect on carbon and phosphate cycling4. Recently, strigolactones were established to be phytohormones that regulate plant shoot architecture by inhibiting the outgrowth of axillary buds5,6. Despite their importance, it is not known how strigolactones are transported. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, however, are known to have functions in phytohormone translocation7,8,9. Here we show that the Petunia hybrida ABC transporter PDR1 has a key role in regulating the development of arbuscular mycorrhizae and axillary branches, by functioning as a cellular strigolactone exporter. P. hybrida pdr1 mutants are defective in strigolactone exudation from their roots, resulting in reduced symbiotic interactions. Above ground, pdr1 mutants have an enhanced branching phenotype, which is indicative of impaired strigolactone allocation. Overexpression of Petunia axillaris PDR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana results in increased tolerance to high concentrations of a synthetic strigolactone, consistent with increased export of strigolactones from the roots. PDR1 is the first known component in strigolactone transport, providing new opportunities for investigating and manipulating strigolactone-dependent processes."

https://openalex.org/W2058104615,"The ORC1 BAH domain is shown to be a module that recognizes a histone modification associated with replication origins, providing insight into the aetiology of Meier–Gorlin syndrome. ORC1 is a subunit of the replication-licensing machinery that associates with replication origins, and mutations in the ORC1 BAH domain have been associated with a dwarfism syndrome. Here, the ORC1 BAH domain is shown to comprise a module that recognizes a histone modification associated with replication origins. Insight into the molecular basis of the interaction is provided by a crystal structure. The interaction between ORC1 BAH domain and the histone modification is required for loading of ORC onto chromatin, and is also required to prevent dwarfism in a zebrafish model of the disease. The recognition of distinctly modified histones by specialized ‘effector’ proteins constitutes a key mechanism for transducing molecular events at chromatin to biological outcomes1. Effector proteins influence DNA-templated processes, including transcription, DNA recombination and DNA repair; however, no effector functions have yet been identified within the mammalian machinery that regulate DNA replication. Here we show that ORC1—a component of ORC (origin of replication complex), which mediates pre-DNA replication licensing2—contains a bromo adjacent homology (BAH) domain that specifically recognizes histone H4 dimethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me2). Recognition of H4K20me2 is a property common to BAH domains present within diverse metazoan ORC1 proteins. Structural studies reveal that the specificity of the BAH domain for H4K20me2 is mediated by a dynamic aromatic dimethyl-lysine-binding cage and multiple intermolecular contacts involving the bound peptide. H4K20me2 is enriched at replication origins, and abrogating ORC1 recognition of H4K20me2 in cells impairs ORC1 occupancy at replication origins, ORC chromatin loading and cell-cycle progression. Mutation of the ORC1 BAH domain has been implicated in the aetiology of Meier–Gorlin syndrome (MGS)3,4, a form of primordial dwarfism5, and ORC1 depletion in zebrafish results in an MGS-like phenotype4. We find that wild-type human ORC1, but not ORC1–H4K20me2-binding mutants, rescues the growth retardation of orc1 morphants. Moreover, zebrafish depleted of H4K20me2 have diminished body size, mirroring the phenotype of orc1 morphants. Together, our results identify the BAH domain as a novel methyl-lysine-binding module, thereby establishing the first direct link between histone methylation and the metazoan DNA replication machinery, and defining a pivotal aetiological role for the canonical H4K20me2 mark, via ORC1, in primordial dwarfism."

https://openalex.org/W1975680207,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and basal ganglia dysfunction impair movement timing, which leads to gait instability and falls. Parkinsonian gait consists of random, disconnected stride times—rather than the 1/f structure observed in healthy gait—and this randomness of stride times (low fractal scaling) predicts falling. Walking with fixed-tempo Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) can improve many aspects of gait timing; however, it lowers fractal scaling (away from healthy 1/f structure) and requires attention. Here we show that interactive rhythmic auditory stimulation reestablishes healthy gait dynamics in PD patients. In the experiment, PD patients and healthy participants walked with a) no auditory stimulation, b) fixed-tempo RAS, and c) interactive rhythmic auditory stimulation. The interactive system used foot sensors and nonlinear oscillators to track and mutually entrain with the human's step timing. Patients consistently synchronized with the interactive system, their fractal scaling returned to levels of healthy participants, and their gait felt more stable to them. Patients and healthy participants rarely synchronized with fixed-tempo RAS, and when they did synchronize their fractal scaling declined from healthy 1/f levels. Five minutes after removing the interactive rhythmic stimulation, the PD patients' gait retained high fractal scaling, suggesting that the interaction stabilized the internal rhythm generating system and reintegrated timing networks. The experiment demonstrates that complex interaction is important in the (re)emergence of 1/f structure in human behavior and that interactive rhythmic auditory stimulation is a promising therapeutic tool for improving gait of PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2122172939,"The hydrogen atom is one of the most important and influential model systems in modern physics. Attempts to understand its spectrum are inextricably linked to the early history and development of quantum mechanics. The hydrogen atom's stature lies in its simplicity and in the accuracy with which its spectrum can be measured and compared to theory. Today its spectrum remains a valuable tool for determining the values of fundamental constants and for challenging the limits of modern physics, including the validity of quantum electrodynamics and--by comparison with measurements on its antimatter counterpart, antihydrogen--the validity of CPT (charge conjugation, parity and time reversal) symmetry. Here we report spectroscopy of a pure antimatter atom, demonstrating resonant quantum transitions in antihydrogen. We have manipulated the internal spin state of antihydrogen atoms so as to induce magnetic resonance transitions between hyperfine levels of the positronic ground state. We used resonant microwave radiation to flip the spin of the positron in antihydrogen atoms that were magnetically trapped in the ALPHA apparatus. The spin flip causes trapped anti-atoms to be ejected from the trap. We look for evidence of resonant interaction by comparing the survival rate of trapped atoms irradiated with microwaves on-resonance to that of atoms subjected to microwaves that are off-resonance. In one variant of the experiment, we detect 23 atoms that survive in 110 trapping attempts with microwaves off-resonance (0.21 per attempt), and only two atoms that survive in 103 attempts with microwaves on-resonance (0.02 per attempt). We also describe the direct detection of the annihilation of antihydrogen atoms ejected by the microwaves."

https://openalex.org/W1973664032,"Protein palmitoylation is rapidly emerging as an important determinant in the regulation of ion channels, including large conductance calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels. However, the enzymes that control channel palmitoylation are largely unknown. Indeed, although palmitoylation is the only reversible lipid modification of proteins, acyl thioesterases that control ion channel depalmitoylation have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that palmitoylation of the intracellular S0-S1 loop of BK channels is controlled by two of the 23 mammalian palmitoyl-transferases, zDHHC22 and zDHHC23. Palmitoylation by these acyl transferases is essential for efficient cell surface expression of BK channels. In contrast, depalmitoylation is controlled by the cytosolic thioesterase APT1 (LYPLA1), but not APT2 (LYPLA2). In addition, we identify a splice variant of LYPLAL1, a homolog with ∼30% identity to APT1, that also controls BK channel depalmitoylation. Thus, both palmitoyl acyltransferases and acyl thioesterases display discrete substrate specificity for BK channels. Because depalmitoylated BK channels are retarded in the trans-Golgi network, reversible protein palmitoylation provides a critical checkpoint to regulate exit from the trans-Golgi network and thus control BK channel cell surface expression."
https://openalex.org/W2152356401,"Recently, mutations in the cyclin M2 (CNNM2) gene were identified to be causative for severe hypomagnesemia. In kidney, CNNM2 is a basolaterally expressed protein with predominant expression in the distal convoluted tubule. Transcellular magnesium (Mg2+) reabsorption in the distal convoluted tubule represents the final step before Mg2+ is excreted into the urine, thus fine-tuning its final excretion via a tightly regulated mechanism. The present study aims to get insight in the structure of CNNM2 and to characterize its post-translational modifications. Here, membrane topology studies using intramolecular epitopes and immunocytochemistry showed that CNNM2 has an extracellular N terminus and an intracellular C terminus. This suggests that one of the predicted transmembrane regions might be re-entrant. By homology modeling, we demonstrated that the loss-of-function mutation as found in patients disturbs the potential ATP binding by the intracellular cystathionine β-synthase domains. In addition, the cellular processing pathway of CNNM2 was exposed in detail. In the endoplasmic reticulum, the signal peptidase complex cleaves off a large N-terminal signal peptide of about 64 amino acids. Mutagenesis screening showed that CNNM2 is glycosylated at residue Asn-112, stabilizing CNNM2 on the plasma membrane. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation studies evidenced that CNNM2a forms heterodimers with the smaller isoform CNNM2b.

As the second most abundant intracellular cation in humans, magnesium (Mg2+) constitutes an essential co-factor in vital processes such as energy metabolism, DNA transcription, and protein synthesis. Balance between intestinal absorption and renal excretion is tightly regulated to keep the plasma Mg2+ concentration in its physiological range (0.7–1.1 mm) (1Glaudemans B. Knoers N.V. Hoenderop J.G.

Specifically, bulk Mg2+ reabsorption in kidney from the pro-urine is dependent on passive, paracellular transport in the proximal tubule and the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop, whereas fine-tuning is achieved by active, transcellular transport in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) 2The abbreviations used are: DCTdistal convoluted tubuleCNTconnecting tubuleNCCNa+-Cl− cotransporterNKCC2Na+-K+-Cl− cotransporterIRESinternal ribosomal entry siteTMtransmembraneCBScystathionine B-synthaseERendoplasmic reticulumAAPV-CMKMeoSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethylketonePNGase FN-glycosidase FSPCsignal peptidase complexPTproximal tubuleTALthick ascending limb of Henle's loop.

CNNM2, formerly known as ancient conserved domain protein 2 (ACDP2), belongs to the CNNM family consisting of four proteins (CNNM1–4) that share homology to cyclins, although no cyclin-related function has been described (5Wang C.Y.

Two predicted CNNM2 protein isoforms are conserved between humans and mouse. Although the 875-amino acid CNNM2a is encoded by splice variant 1 (Cnnm2v1, NM_017649), the 22-residue-shorter isoform b is translated from splice variant 2 (Cnnm2v2, NM_199076), which lacks exon 6. CNNM2 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and in the Mg2+-deficient Salmonella enterica strain MM281 has been suggested to be involved in Mg2+ transport (6Goytain A. Quamme G.A.

This last finding could indicate that instead of transporting Mg2+ itself, CNNM2 might be involved in a Mg2+-sensing mechanism that, in turn, could regulate renal Mg2+ uptake.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the membrane topology of CNNM2 and to provide a molecular characterization of the intracellular processing mechanisms.

The complete ORFs of all expression constructs were sequence-verified. HEK293 cells were grown at 37 °C in DMEM (Biowhittaker Europe, Vervier, Belgium) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS (PAA Laboratories, Linz, Austria), nonessential amino acids, and 2 mm l-glutamine in a humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere. A few hours before transfection with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), cells were seeded in 12-well plates and subsequently transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of pCINeo-IRES-GFP constructs encoding HA-tagged wild type or mutated CNNM2 proteins at a 1:2 DNA to Lipofectamine ratio. COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) in a humidified environment of 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C. COS-7 cells were seeded on glass coverslips and transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol with constructs expressing epitope-tagged CNNM2 or CNNM4. After 2 days of growth in medium supplemented with 20 mm MgCl2, the cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed for 10 min with 4% (w/v) methanol-free formaldehyde solution (Thermo Scientific) in PBS. In a control experiment (supplemental Fig. S1, lower panels), living cells were incubated with primary antibody rat anti-HA (Roche Applied Science, high affinity 3F10, 1:250) for 60 min at 4 °C before formaldehyde fixation. After rinses in PBS, some of the cells were incubated for 10 min with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for permeabilization. After PBS rinses, the cells were incubated with blocking buffer (5% (v/v) donkey serum (Sigma) in PBS) for 1 h and immunolabeled with the primary antibodies rat anti-HA (1:250), mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma, 1:250), rabbit anti-calnexin (C5C9, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:50), or rabbit anti-CNNM2 (Abcam, Ab111351, 1:50) in blocking buffer for 90 min. After rinses in PBS, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG secondary antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:500) and DAPI (2 μg/ml) for 45 min. After PBS and ethanol rinses, the cells were mounted on slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Leica DMIRE2 inverted microscope, and images were taken with the Openlab software. A homology model was built using the modeling script in the WHATIF and YASARA Twinset with standard parameters (14Krieger E. Joo K. Lee J. Lee J. Raman S. Thompson J. Tyka M. Baker D. Karplus K.

We used the structure of a cystathionine B-synthase (CBS) domain pair structure of the Mg2+ and Co2+ efflux protein CorC from Bordetella parapertussis (Protein Data Bank (PDB) file 3jtf) as a template for modeling. Biotinylation experiments were performed as described previously (16van de Graaf S.F. Hoenderop J.G. Gkika D. Lamers D. Prenen J. Rescher U. Gerke V. Staub O. Nilius B. Bindels R.J.

In short, HEK293 cells were transfected for 48 h, and cell surfaces were biotinylated at 4 °C for 1 h by adding sulfo-NHS-LC-LC-biotin. Subsequently, protein lysates were incubated overnight with NeutrAvidin-agarose beads (Pierce). Protein lysates were denatured in Laemmli containing 100 mm DTT for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE. Then, immunoblots were incubated with mouse anti-HA (Cell Signaling Technology) primary antibodies and peroxidase conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Sigma). PNGase F (New England Biolabs) was added to the protein lysates in Laemmli-DTT buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h before loading the protein samples on gel. COS-7 cells were cultured and transfected as described above with expression vectors for HA- and FLAG-tagged wild type CNNM2 or CNNM4 isoforms. 48 h after transfection, cells were scraped from dishes in ice-cold 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) followed by centrifugation at 5000 × g. The pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl; 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40; 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5; and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) by repeated passage through a 26-gauge needle. Protein concentration measurement was performed using a BCA assay (Pierce). The next incubation steps were all done under rotary agitation at 4 °C. Protein aliquots of 100 μg in lysis buffer were precleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h after which the precleared lysate was incubated for 18 h with 2.5 μg of anti-HA antibody (Roche Applied Science, high affinity 3F10). The antibody-lysate mixture was added to 50 μl of fresh protein G-Sepharose beads and incubated for 1 h. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C and washed four times with lysis buffer. The proteins were separated from the beads by boiling for 5 min in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and detected by immunoblotting using a mouse monoclonal antibody against FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:1000). The cDNA template for in vitro transcription contained the Cnnm2-HA sequence downstream of a T7 promoter sequence in a pT7Ts vector. The coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. The reaction mixture contained 2 μg of cDNA template, 2 μl of reaction buffer, 1 μl of T7 RNA polymerase, 1 μl of amino acid mix without methionine, 3 μl of [35S]Met (1 μCi/μl), RNasin, and 25 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). The reaction was performed with or without signal peptidase inhibitor MeoSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethylketone (AAPV-CMK, Sigma). The protein mixture was separated on an 8% (w/v) SDS-PAGE gel. The gel was fixed in a mixture of acetic acid, methanol, and H2O (20:10:70) and incubated in 20% (w/v) 2,5-diphenyloxazole in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to intensify the radioactive signal. The proteins were visualized using CL-XPosure films (Pierce, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands). In all experiments, data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using an unpaired Student's t test, and differences with p < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. To examine the transcript expression levels for CNNM1–4 in various tissues, a mouse tissue cDNA panel was constructed, and Cnnm mRNA expressions were quantified by real-time PCR analysis. Gapdh expression was used to normalize values. Cnnm3v1 and Cnnm3v2 (containing an alternative last exon) show a ubiquitous expression pattern with highest expression in kidney, brain, lung, spleen, and heart (Fig. 1, D and E). Cnnm1 expression is predominantly found in brain and testis (Fig. 1A), whereas Cnnm4 shows highest expression along the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, Cnnm2 shows a ubiquitous expression pattern with highest expression in kidney, lung, spleen, and testis (Fig. 1, B and C). CNNM2A and CNNM2B (encoded by Cnnm2v1 and Cnnm2v2, lacking exon 6) share a similar pattern; only minor differences between the tissue expression levels were measured. Because CNNM2 has been described to be causative for hypomagnesemia due to excessive renal Mg2+ wasting (3Stuiver M. Lainez S. Will C. Terryn S. Günzel D. Debaix H. Sommer K. Kopplin K. Thumfart J.

Genet. 2011; 88: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), its kidney localization was investigated in detail. Using immunohistochemistry, co-expression of CNNM2 with markers of different distal nephron segments was examined: the Na-K-Cl cotransporter NKCC2 (thick ascending limb of Henle's loop), the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter NCC (DCT), calbindin-D28k (CNT and cortical collecting duct), and aquaporin-2 (collecting duct). CNNM2 was expressed on the basolateral side of the cells (Fig. 2, A–D, green), opposed to the luminal expression of the marker proteins (Fig. 2, A–D, red). CNNM2 immunopositive tubules were negative for aquaporin-2 staining, but did co-stain with NCC-positive tubules. Only a part of the tubules positive for calbindin-D28k showed CNNM2 staining. Although most of NKCC2-positive tubules are negative for CNNM2, only a few NKCC2-positive tubules show faint CNNM2 staining. These results indicate that CNNM2 is predominantly expressed in DCT. mRNA expression levels measured by real-time PCR on GFP-sorted DCT and CNT tubules showed an equivalent pattern; expression of Cnnm2v1 and Cnnm2v2 was high in DCT and to a lesser extent also in the CNT (Fig. 2E). As a control for DCT and CNT specificity of the mRNA, we examined the expression of the transcripts for the marker proteins TRPM6 and TRPV5, respectively (Fig. 2E). These and previous results (3Stuiver M. Lainez S. Will C. Terryn S. Günzel D. Debaix H. Sommer K. Kopplin K. Thumfart J. Kampik N.B. Querfeld U. Willnow T.E. Němec V. Wagner C.A. Hoenderop J.G.

https://openalex.org/W2033174559,"Reductions in calcification in reef-building corals occur when thermal conditions are suboptimal, but it is unclear how they vary between genera in response to the same thermal stress event. Using densitometry techniques, we investigate reductions in the calcification rate of massive Porites spp. from the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), and P. astreoides, Montastraea faveolata, and M. franksi from the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef (MBR), and correlate them to thermal stress associated with ocean warming. Results show that Porites spp. are more sensitive to increasing temperature than Montastraea, with calcification rates decreasing by 0.40 g cm(-2) year(-1) in Porites spp. and 0.12 g cm(-2) year(-1) in Montastraea spp. for each 1°C increase. Under similar warming trends, the predicted calcification rates at 2100 are close to zero in Porites spp. and reduced by 40% in Montastraea spp. However, these predictions do not account for ocean acidification. Although yearly mean aragonite saturation (Ω(ar)) at MBR sites has recently decreased, only P. astreoides at Chinchorro showed a reduction in calcification. In corals at the other sites calcification did not change, indicating there was no widespread effect of Ω(ar) changes on coral calcification rate in the MBR. Even in the absence of ocean acidification, differential reductions in calcification between Porites spp. and Montastraea spp. associated with warming might be expected to have significant ecological repercussions. For instance, Porites spp. invest increased calcification in extension, and under warming scenarios it may reduce their ability to compete for space. As a consequence, shifts in taxonomic composition would be expected in Indo-Pacific reefs with uncertain repercussions for biodiversity. By contrast, Montastraea spp. use their increased calcification resources to construct denser skeletons. Reductions in calcification would therefore make them more susceptible to both physical and biological breakdown, seriously affecting ecosystem function in Atlantic reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2067171867,"Innate antiviral responses in bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) provide the first line of defense against respiratory viral infection and the effectiveness of this response is critically dependent on the type I interferons (IFNs). However the importance of the antiviral responses in BECs during influenza infection is not well understood. We profiled the innate immune response to infection with H3N2 and H5N1 virus using Calu-3 cells and primary BECs to model proximal airway cells. The susceptibility of BECs to influenza infection was not solely dependent on the sialic acid-bearing glycoprotein, and antiviral responses that occurred after viral endocytosis was more important in limiting viral replication. The early antiviral response and apoptosis correlated with the ability to limit viral replication. Both viruses reduced RIG-I associated antiviral responses and subsequent induction of IFN-β. However it was found that there was constitutive release of IFN-β by BECs and this was critical in inducing late antiviral signaling via type I IFN receptors, and was crucial in limiting viral infection. This study characterizes anti-influenza virus responses in airway epithelial cells and shows that constitutive IFN-β release plays a more important role in initiating protective late IFN-stimulated responses during human influenza infection in bronchial epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2063017619,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of stacked species distribution models in predicting the alpha and gamma species diversity patterns of two important plant clades along elevation in the Andes. We modelled the distribution of the species in the Anthurium genus (53 species) and the Bromeliaceae family (89 species) using six modelling techniques. We combined all of the predictions for the same species in ensemble models based on two different criteria: the average of the rescaled predictions by all techniques and the average of the best techniques. The rescaled predictions were then reclassified into binary predictions (presence/absence). By stacking either the original predictions or binary predictions for both ensemble procedures, we obtained four different species richness models per taxa. The gamma and alpha diversity per elevation band (500 m) was also computed. To evaluate the prediction abilities for the four predictions of species richness and gamma diversity, the models were compared with the real data along an elevation gradient that was independently compiled by specialists. Finally, we also tested whether our richness models performed better than a null model of altitudinal changes of diversity based on the literature. Stacking of the ensemble prediction of the individual species models generated richness models that proved to be well correlated with the observed alpha diversity richness patterns along elevation and with the gamma diversity derived from the literature. Overall, these models tend to overpredict species richness. The use of the ensemble predictions from the species models built with different techniques seems very promising for modelling of species assemblages. Stacking of the binary models reduced the over-prediction, although more research is needed. The randomisation test proved to be a promising method for testing the performance of the stacked models, but other implementations may still be developed."
https://openalex.org/W2007298495,"Background The Hippo pathway regulates organ size by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell apoptosis upon its activation. The Yes Associated Protein 1 (YAP1) is a nuclear effector of the Hippo pathway that promotes cell growth as a transcription co-activator. In human cancer, the YAP1 gene was reported as amplified and over-expressed in several tumor types. Methods Immunohistochemical staining of YAP1 protein was used to assess the expression of YAP1 in pancreatic tumor tissues. siRNA oligonucleotides were used to knockdown the expression of YAP1 and their effects on pancreatic cancer cells were investigated using cell proliferation, apoptosis, and anchorage-independent growth assays. The Wilcoxon signed-rank, Pearson correlation coefficient, Kendall's Tau, Spearman's Rho, and an independent two-sample t (two-tailed) test were used to determine the statistical significance of the data. Results Immunohistochemistry studies in pancreatic tumor tissues revealed YAP1 staining intensities were moderate to strong in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the tumor cells, whereas the adjacent normal epithelial showed negative to weak staining. In cultured cells, YAP1 expression and localization was modulated by cell density. YAP1 total protein expression increased in the nuclear fractions in BxPC-3 and PANC-1, while it declined in HPDE6 as cell density increased. Additionally, treatment of pancreatic cancer cell lines, BxPC-3 and PANC-1, with YAP1-targeting siRNA oligonucleotides significantly reduced their proliferation in vitro. Furthermore, treatment with YAP1 siRNA oligonucleotides diminished the anchorage-independent growth on soft agar of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting a role of YAP1 in pancreatic cancer tumorigenesis. Conclusions YAP1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer tissues and potentially plays an important role in the clonogenicity and growth of pancreatic cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2155552213,"Diminishing global fresh water availability has focused research to elucidate mechanisms of water use in poplar, an economically important species. A GT-2 family trihelix transcription factor that is a determinant of water use efficiency (WUE), PtaGTL1 (GT-2 like 1), was identified in Populus tremula × P. alba (clone 717-IB4). Like other GT-2 family members, PtaGTL1 contains both N- and C-terminal trihelix DNA binding domains. PtaGTL1 expression, driven by the Arabidopsis thaliana AtGTL1 promoter, suppressed the higher WUE and drought tolerance phenotypes of an Arabidopsis GTL1 loss-of-function mutation (gtl1-4). Genetic suppression of gtl1-4 was associated with increased stomatal density due to repression of Arabidopsis STOMATAL DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION1 (AtSDD1), a negative regulator of stomatal development. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) indicated that a PtaGTL1 C-terminal DNA trihelix binding fragment (PtaGTL1-C) interacted with an AtSDD1 promoter fragment containing the GT3 box (GGTAAA), and this GT3 box was necessary for binding. PtaGTL1-C also interacted with a PtaSDD1 promoter fragment via the GT2 box (GGTAAT). PtaSDD1 encodes a protein with 60% primary sequence identity with AtSDD1. In vitro molecular interaction assays were used to determine that Ca2+-loaded calmodulin (CaM) binds to PtaGTL1-C, which was predicted to have a CaM-interaction domain in the first helix of the C-terminal trihelix DNA binding domain. These results indicate that, in Arabidopsis and poplar, GTL1 and SDD1 are fundamental components of stomatal lineage. In addition, PtaGTL1 is a Ca2+-CaM binding protein, which infers a mechanism by which environmental stimuli can induce Ca2+ signatures that would modulate stomatal development and regulate plant water use."
https://openalex.org/W1983256420,"PP5 is a unique member of serine/threonine phosphatases comprising a regulatory tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain and functions in signaling pathways that control many cellular responses. We reported previously that Ca(2+)/S100 proteins directly associate with several TPR-containing proteins and lead to dissociate the interactions of TPR proteins with their client proteins. Here, we identified protein phosphatase 5 (PP5) as a novel target of S100 proteins. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that S100A1, S100A2, S100A6, and S100B proteins specifically interact with PP5-TPR and inhibited the PP5-Hsp90 interaction. In addition, the S100 proteins activate PP5 by using a synthetic phosphopeptide and a physiological protein substrate, Tau. Overexpression of S100A1 in COS-7 cells induced dephosphorylation of Tau. However, S100A1 and permanently active S100P inhibited the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and PP5 interaction, resulting the inhibition of dephosphorylation of phospho-ASK1 by PP5. The association of the S100 proteins with PP5 provides a Ca(2+)-dependent regulatory mechanism for the phosphorylation status of intracellular proteins through the regulation of PP5 enzymatic activity or PP5-client protein interaction."

This phenomenon was up to now difficult to incorporate in open population models and most authors have chosen to neglect it although this may have damaging consequences. Focusing on the situation where animals exhibit a trap response at the occasion immediately following one where they have been trapped but revert to their original naïve state if they are missed once, we show that trap-dependence is more naturally viewed as a state transition and is amenable to the current models of capture-recapture. This approach has the potential to accommodate lasting or progressively waning trap effects."

The germ tube positive isolates were provisionally identified as C. dubliniensis by presence of fringed and rough colonies on sunflower seed agar. Subsequently, their identity was confirmed by Vitek2 Yeast identification system and/or by amplification and sequencing of the ITS region of rDNA. In all, 368 isolates were identified as C. dubliniensis; 67.1% came from respiratory specimens, 11.7% from oral swabs, 9.2% from urine, 3.8% from blood, 2.7% from vaginal swabs and 5.4% from other sources. All C. dubliniensis isolates tested by Etest were susceptible to voriconazole and amphotericin B. Resistance to fluconazole (≥8 µg/ml) was observed in 2.5% of C. dubliniensis isolates, 7 of which occurred between 2008-2010. Of note was the diagnosis of C. dubliniensis candidemia in 14 patients, 11 of them occurring between 2008-2010. None of the bloodstream isolate was resistant to fluconazole, while a solitary isolate showed increased MIC to 5-flucytosine (>32 µg/ml) and belonged to genotype 4. A review of literature since 1999 revealed 28 additional cases of C. dubliniensis candidemia, and 167 isolates identified from blood cultures since 1982. In conclusion, this study highlights a greater role of C. dubliniensis in bloodstream infections than hitherto recognized."

Several LQT2-associated mutations have been mapped to the amino terminal cytoplasmic Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain of the HERG1a channel subunit. Here we have characterized the trafficking properties of some LQT2-associated PAS domain mutants and analyzed rescue of the trafficking mutants by low temperature (27°C) or by the pore blocker drug E4031. We show that the LQT2-associated mutations in the PAS domain of the HERG channel display molecular properties that are distinct from the properties of LQT2-associated mutations in the trans-membrane region. Unlike the latter, many of the tested PAS domain LQT2-associated mutations do not result in trafficking deficiency of the channel. Moreover, the majority of the PAS domain mutations that cause trafficking deficiencies are not rescued by a pore blocking drug. We have also explored the in vitro folding stability properties of isolated mutant PAS domain proteins using a thermal unfolding fluorescence assay and a chemical unfolding assay."

https://openalex.org/W2067910011,"Placental malaria is a common clinical complication during pregnancy and is associated with abortion, premature delivery, intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight. The present study was designed to delineate the underlying mechanism of placental pathology during malarial infection with special reference to oxidative stress and apoptosis. Experimentally, pregnant BALB/c mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei infected red blood cells on gestation day 10. The presence of malarial infection in placenta was confirmed by histopathological studies. It was observation that infected placenta had plugged placental sinusoids with parasitized red blood cells and malarial pigments. Interestingly, we found significant increase in the level of malondialdehyde, the index of oxidative stress and decreased activity of catalase, the antioxidant in infected placenta. Furthermore, in infected placenta the oxidative stress mediated apoptosis was determined by DNA fragmentation assay, ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining and caspase activity. It was observed that oxidative stress begin after second day of malarial infection. Interestingly, it was observed that there was down regulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and up regulation of pro-apoptotic protein Bax in infected placenta, suggesting the involvement of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis which was further confirmed by activation of caspase 9. However, no change in the expression of Fas gene and caspase 8 activity, indicated the absence of death receptor pathway. Thus, it can be concluded that the placental pathology during malarial infection is mediated by mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis occurring due to augmented lipid peroxidation which may in turn jeopardise the materno-fetal relationship."
https://openalex.org/W2106782145,"Scrub jays are thought to use many tactics to protect their caches. For instance, they predominantly bury food far away from conspecifics, and if they must cache while being watched, they often re-cache their worms later, once they are in private. Two explanations have been offered for such observations, and they are intensely debated. First, the birds may reason about their competitors' mental states, with a 'theory of mind'; alternatively, they may apply behavioral rules learned in daily life. Although this second hypothesis is cognitively simpler, it does seem to require a different, ad-hoc behavioral rule for every caching and re-caching pattern exhibited by the birds. Our new theory avoids this drawback by explaining a large variety of patterns as side-effects of stress and the resulting memory errors. Inspired by experimental data, we assume that re-caching is not motivated by a deliberate effort to safeguard specific caches from theft, but by a general desire to cache more. This desire is brought on by stress, which is determined by the presence and dominance of onlookers, and by unsuccessful recovery attempts. We study this theory in two experiments similar to those done with real birds with a kind of 'virtual bird', whose behavior depends on a set of basic assumptions about corvid cognition, and a well-established model of human memory. Our results show that the 'virtual bird' acts as the real birds did; its re-caching reflects whether it has been watched, how dominant its onlooker was, and how close to that onlooker it has cached. This happens even though it cannot attribute mental states, and it has only a single behavioral rule assumed to be previously learned. Thus, our simulations indicate that corvid re-caching can be explained without sophisticated social cognition. Given our specific predictions, our theory can easily be tested empirically."

When administered during early postnatal life, ADs produce long-lasting biochemical and behavioural alterations that are observed in adult animals.We have here examined the responsiveness of brain TrkB receptors to BDNF and ADs during early postnatal life of mouse, measured as autophosphorylation of TrkB (pTrkB).We found that ADs fail to induce TrkB signalling before postnatal day 12 (P12) after which an adult response of TrkB to ADs was observed. Interestingly, there was a temporally inverse correlation between the appearance of the responsiveness of TrkB to systemic ADs and the marked developmental reduction of BDNF-induced TrkB in brain microslices ex vivo. Basal p-TrkB status in the brain of BDNF deficient mice was significantly reduced only during early postnatal period. Enhancing cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate) signalling failed to facilitate TrkB responsiveness to BDNF. Reduced responsiveness of TrkB to BDNF was not produced by the developmental increase in the expression of dominant-negative truncated TrkB.T1 because this reduction was similarly observed in the brain microslices of trkB.T1(-/-) mice. Moreover, postnatal AD administration produced long-lasting behavioural alterations observable in adult mice, but the responses were different when mice were treated during the time when ADs did not (P4-9) or did (P16-21) activate TrkB.We have found that ADs induce the activation of TrkB only in mice older than 2 weeks and that responsiveness of brain microslices to BDNF is reduced during the same time period. Exposure to ADs before and after the age when ADs activate TrkB produces differential long-term behavioural responses in adult mice."

Here we report the isolation and characterization of two novel conotoxins from the venom of Conus imperialis. These two toxins contain a novel cysteine framework, C-C-C-CC-C, which has not been found in other conotoxins described to date. We name it framework XXIII and designate the two toxins im23a and im23b; cDNAs of these toxins exhibit a novel signal peptide sequence, which defines a new K-superfamily. The disulfide connectivity of im23a has been mapped by chemical mapping of partially reduced intermediates and by NMR structure calculations, both of which establish a I-II, III-IV, V-VI pattern of disulfide bridges. This pattern was also confirmed by synthesis of im23a with orthogonal protection of individual cysteine residues. The solution structure of im23a reveals that im23a adopts a novel helical hairpin fold. A cluster of acidic residues on the surface of the molecule is able to bind calcium. The biological activity of the native and recombinant peptides was tested by injection into mice intracranially and intravenously to assess the effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems, respectively. Intracranial injection of im23a or im23b into mice induced excitatory symptoms; however, the biological target of these new toxins has yet to be identified.

https://openalex.org/W2168633809,"Control selection is a major challenge in epidemiologic case-control studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate using hospital versus neighborhood control groups in studying risk factors of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).We compared the results of two different case-control studies of ESCC conducted in the same region by a single research group. Case definition and enrollment were the same in the two studies, but control selection differed. In the first study, we selected two age- and sex-matched controls from inpatient subjects in hospitals, while for the second we selected two age- and sex-matched controls from each subject's neighborhood of residence. We used the test of heterogeneity to compare the results of the two studies. We found no significant differences in exposure data for tobacco-related variables such as cigarette smoking, chewing Nass (a tobacco product) and hookah (water pipe) usage, but the frequency of opium usage was significantly different between hospital and neighborhood controls. Consequently, the inference drawn for the association between ESCC and tobacco use did not differ between the studies, but it did for opium use. In the study using neighborhood controls, opium use was associated with a significantly increased risk of ESCC (adjusted OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.17-2.68), while in the study using hospital controls, this was not the case (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63-1.87). Comparing the prevalence of opium consumption in the two control groups and a cohort enrolled from the same geographic area suggested that the neighborhood controls were more representative of the study base population for this exposure.Hospital and neighborhood controls did not lead us to the same conclusion for a major hypothesized risk factor for ESCC in this population. Our results show that control group selection is critical in drawing appropriate conclusions in observational studies."

https://openalex.org/W1986638484,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP-activated Cl(-) channel expressed in the apical plasma membrane of fluid-transporting epithelia, where the plasma membrane abundance of CFTR is in part controlled by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The protein networks that control CFTR endocytosis in epithelial cells have only been partially explored. The assembly polypeptide-2 complex (AP-2) is the prototypical endocytic adaptor critical for optimal clathrin coat formation. AP-2 is essential for recruitment of cargo proteins bearing the YXXΦ motif. Although AP-2 interacts directly with CFTR in vitro and facilitates CFTR endocytosis in some cell types, it remains unknown whether it is critical for CFTR uptake into clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). Disabled-2 (Dab2) is a clathrin-associated sorting protein (CLASP) that contributes to clathrin recruitment, vesicle formation, and cargo selection. In intestinal epithelial cells Dab2 was not found to play a direct role in CFTR endocytosis. By contrast, AP-2 and Dab2 were shown to facilitate CFTR endocytosis in human airway epithelial cells, although the specific mechanism remains unknown. Our data demonstrate that Dab2 mediates AP-2 independent recruitment of CFTR to CCVs in polarized human airway epithelial cells. As a result, it facilitates CFTR endocytosis and reduces CFTR abundance and stability in the plasma membrane. These effects are mediated by the DAB homology domain. Moreover, we show that in human airway epithelial cells AP-2 is not essential for CFTR recruitment to CCVs."
https://openalex.org/W2157497929,"ATP Binding Cassette B1 (ABCB1) is a transporter with a broad substrate specificity involved in the elimination of several carcinogens from the gut. Several polymorphic variants within the ABCB1 gene have been reported as modulators of ABCB1-mediated transport. We investigated the impact of ABCB1 genetic variants on colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. A hybrid tagging/functional approach was performed to select 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were genotyped in 1,321 Czech subjects, 699 CRC cases and 622 controls. In addition, six potentially functional SNPs were genotyped in 3,662 German subjects, 1,809 cases and 1,853 controls from the DACHS study. We found that three functional SNPs (rs1202168, rs1045642 and rs868755) were associated with CRC risk in the German population. Carriers of the rs1202168_T and rs868755_T alleles had an increased risk for CRC (P(trend) = 0.016 and 0.029, respectively), while individuals bearing the rs1045642_C allele showed a decreased risk of CRC (P(trend) = 0.022). We sought to replicate the most significant results in an independent case-control study of 3,803 subjects, 2,169 cases and 1,634 controls carried out in the North of Germany. None of the SNPs tested were significantly associated with CRC risk in the replication study. In conclusion, in this study of about 8,800 individuals we show that ABCB1 gene polymorphisms play at best a minor role in the susceptibility to CRC."

https://openalex.org/W2084731734,"Background The cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine-3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine-3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) are important second messengers and are potential biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we investigated by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of cAMP and cGMP of 82 patients and evaluated their diagnostic potency as biomarkers. For comparison with a well-accepted biomarker, we measured tau concentrations in CSF of CJD and control patients. CJD patients (n = 15) had lower cAMP (−70%) and cGMP (−55%) concentrations in CSF compared with controls (n = 11). There was no difference in PD, PD dementia (PDD) and ALS cases. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses confirmed cAMP and cGMP as valuable diagnostic markers for CJD indicated by the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 (cAMP) and 0.85 (cGMP). We calculated a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 64% for cAMP and a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 100% for cGMP. The combination of both nucleotides increased the sensitivity to 80% and specificity to 91% for the term cAMPxcGMP (AUC 0.92) and to 93% and 100% for the ratio tau/cAMP (AUC 0.99). Conclusions/Significance We conclude that the CSF determination of cAMP and cGMP may easily be included in the diagnosis of CJD and could be helpful in monitoring disease progression as well as in therapy control."

https://openalex.org/W1971398040,"No unique transcription factor or biomarker has been identified to reliably distinguish effector from memory T cells. Instead a set of surface markers including IL-7Rα and KLRG1 is commonly used to predict the potential of CD8 effector T cells to differentiate into memory cells. Similarly, these surface markers together with the tumor necrosis factor family member CD27 are frequently used to predict a memory T cell's ability to mount a recall response. Expression of these markers changes every time a memory cell is stimulated and repeated stimulation can lead to T cell senescence and loss of memory T cell responsiveness. This is a concern for prime–boost vaccine strategies which repeatedly stimulate T cells with the aim of increasing memory T cell frequency. The molecular cues that cause senescence are still unknown, but cell division history is likely to play a major role. We sought to dissect the roles of inflammation and cell division history in developing T cell senescence and their impact on the expression pattern of commonly used markers of senescence. We developed a system that allows priming of CD8 T cells with minimal inflammation and without acquisition of maximal effector function, such as granzyme expression, but a cell division history similar to priming with systemic inflammation. Memory cells derived from minimal effector T cells are fully functional upon rechallenge, have full access to non-lymphoid tissue and appear to be less senescent by phenotype upon rechallenge. However, we report here that these currently used biomarkers to measure senescence do not predict proliferative potential or protective ability, but merely reflect initial priming conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2035888446,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are non-selective cation channels activated by extracellular acidosis associated with many physiological and pathological conditions. A detailed understanding of the mechanisms that govern cell surface expression of ASICs, therefore, is critical for better understanding of the cell signaling under acidosis conditions. In this study, we examined the role of a highly conserved salt bridge residing at the extracellular loop of rat ASIC3 (Asp(107)-Arg(153)) and human ASIC1a (Asp(107)-Arg(160)) channels. Comprehensive mutagenesis and electrophysiological recordings revealed that the salt bridge is essential for functional expression of ASICs in a pH sensing-independent manner. Surface biotinylation and immunolabeling of an extracellular epitope indicated that mutations, including even minor alterations, at the salt bridge impaired cell surface expression of ASICs. Molecular dynamics simulations, normal mode analysis, and further mutagenesis studies suggested a high stability and structural constrain of the salt bridge, which serves to separate an adjacent structurally rigid signal patch, important for surface expression, from a flexible gating domain. Thus, we provide the first evidence of structural requirement that involves a stabilizing salt bridge and an exposed rigid signal patch at the destined extracellular loop for normal surface expression of ASICs. These findings will allow evaluation of new strategies aimed at preventing excessive excitability and neuronal injury associated with tissue acidosis and ASIC activation."
https://openalex.org/W2088351496,"Natural HIV-1 protease (PR) is homodimeric. Some researchers believe that interactions between HIV-1 Gag-Pol molecules trigger the activation of embedded PR (which mediates Gag and Gag-Pol cleavage), and that Gag-Pol assembly domains outside of PR may contribute to PR activation by influencing PR dimer interaction in a Gag-Pol context. To determine if the enhancement of PR dimer interaction facilitates PR activation, we placed single or tandem repeat leucine zippers (LZ) at the PR C-terminus, and looked for a correlation between enhanced Gag processing efficiency and increased Gag-PR-LZ multimerization capacity. We found significant reductions in virus-like particles (VLPs) produced by HIV-1 mutants, with LZ fused to the end of PR as a result of enhanced Gag cleavage efficiency. Since VLP production can be restored to wt levels following PR activity inhibition, this assembly defect is considered PR activity-dependent. We also found a correlation between the LZ enhancement effect on Gag cleavage and enhanced Gag-PR multimerization. The results suggest that PR dimer interactions facilitated by forced Gag-PR multimerization lead to premature Gag cleavage, likely a result of premature PR activation. Our conclusion is that placement of a heterologous dimerization domain downstream of PR enhances PR-mediated Gag cleavage efficiency, implying that structural conformation, rather than the primary sequence outside of PR, is a major determinant of HIV-1 PR activation."
https://openalex.org/W1993359078,"Repulsive guidance molecule (RGM) is a membrane-bound protein that was originally identified as an axon guidance molecule in the chick retinotectal system. RGMa, one of the 3 isoforms found in mammals, is involved in laminar patterning, cephalic neural tube closure, axon guidance, and inhibition of axonal regeneration. In addition to its roles in the nervous system, RGMa plays a role in enhancing helper T-cell activation. Binding of RGM to its receptor, neogenin, is considered necessary to transduce these signals; however, information on the binding of RGM to neogenin is limited. Using co-immunoprecipitation studies, we have identified that the RGMa region required for binding to neogenin contains amino acids (aa) 259-295. Synthesized peptide consisting of aa 284-293 directly binds to the extracellular domain (ECD) of recombinant neogenin, and addition of this peptide inhibits RGMa-induced growth cone collapse in mouse cortical neurons. Thus, we propose that this peptide is a promising lead in finding reagents capable of inhibiting RGMa signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2022015720,"Accumulating evidence indicates that epithelial cancer cells, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells, express immunoglobulins (Igs). We previously found that the expression of the kappa light chain protein in NPC cells can be upregulated by the EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). In the present study, we used NPC cell lines as models and found that LMP1-augmented kappa production corresponds with elevations in ERKs phosphorylation. PD98059 attenuates LMP1-induced ERKs phosphorylation resulting in decreased expression of the kappa light chain. ERK-specific small interfering RNA blunts LMP1-induced kappa light chain gene expression. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that immunoglobulin κ 3' enhancer (3'E(κ)) is active in Igκ-expressing NPC cells and LMP1 upregulates the activity of 3'E(κ) in NPC cells. Moreover, mutation analysis of the PU binding site in 3'E(κ) and inhibition of the MEK/ERKs pathway by PD98059 indicate that the PU site is functional and LMP1-enhanced 3'E(κ) activity is partly regulated by this site. PD98059 treatment also leads to a concentration-dependent inhibition of LMP1-induced Ets-1 expression and phosphorylation, which corresponds with a dose-dependent attenuation of LMP1-induced ERK phosphorylation and kappa light chain expression. Suppression of endogenous Ets-1 by small interfering RNA is accompanied by a decrease of Ig kappa light chain expression. Gel shift assays using nuclear extracts of NPC cells indicate that the transcription factor Ets-1 is recruited by LMP1 to the PU motif within 3'E(κ)in vitro. ChIP assays further demonstrate Ets-1 binding to the PU motif of 3'E(κ) in cells. These results suggest that LMP1 upregulates 3'E(κ) activity and kappa gene expression by activating the Ets-1 transcription factor through the ERKs signaling pathway. Our studies provide evidence for a novel regulatory mechanism of kappa expression, by which virus-encoded proteins activate the kappa 3' enhancer through activating transcription factors in non-B epithelial cancer cells."

Here, we report the establishment of a new mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived megakaryocytic cell line, MKD1. The cells are factor-dependent, their cell surface immunophenotype and gene expression profile closely resemble that of primary megakaryocyte progenitors (MkPs) and they further differentiate along the megakaryocyte lineage upon valproic acid treatment. At a functional level, we show that ablation of SCL expression, a transcription factor critical for MkP maturation, leads to gene expression alterations similar to that observed in primary, Scl-excised MkPs. Moreover, the cell line is amenable to biochemical and transcriptional analyses, as we report for GpVI, a direct target of SCL. Thus, the MKD1 cell line offers a pertinent experimental model to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying MkP biology and more broadly megakaryopoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W1996595410,"Mycobacterium cultures, from patients suspected of tuberculosis or nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infection, need to be identified. It is most critical to identify cultures belonging to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, but also important to recognize clinically irrelevant or important NTM to allow appropriate patient management. Identification of M. tuberculosis can be achieved by a simple and cheap lateral flow assay, but identification of other Mycobacterium spp. generally requires more complex molecular methods. Here we demonstrate that a paramagnetic liquid bead array method can be used to capture mycobacterial rRNA in crude lysates of positive cultures and use a robust reader to identify the species in a direct and sensitive manner. We developed an array composed of paramagnetic beads coupled to oligonucleotides to capture 16 rRNA from eight specific Mycobacterium species and a single secondary biotinilated reporter probe to allow the captured rRNA to be detected. A ninth less specific bead and its associated reporter probe, designed to capture 23S rRNA from mycobacteria and related genera, is included as an internal control to confirm the presence of bacterial rRNA from a GC rich Gram variable genera. Using this rRNA capture assay (rCapA) with the array developed we were already able to confirm the presence of members of the M. tuberculosis complex and to discriminate a range of NTM species. This approach is not based on DNA amplification and therefore does not require precautions to avoid amplicon contamination. Moreover, the new generation of stable and cost effective liquid bead readers provides the necessary multiplexing potential to develop a robust and highly discriminatory assay."
