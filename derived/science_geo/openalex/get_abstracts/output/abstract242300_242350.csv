https://openalex.org/W2041269288,"Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet. The antioxidant and anticarcinogenic properties of chlorogenic acid have been established in animal studies. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms through which chlorogenic acid inhibits carcinogenesis. In this study, we found that chlorogenic acid inhibited the proliferation of A549 human cancer cells in vitro. The results of the soft agar assay indicated that chlorogenic acid suppressed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P+ cells in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment of JB6 cells with chlorogenic acid blocked UVB- or TPA-induced transactivation of AP-1 and NF-κB over the same dose range. At low concentrations, chlorogenic acid decreased the phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases, p38 kinase, and MAPK kinase 4 induced by UVB/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, yet higher doses were required to inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinases. Chlorogenic acid also increased the enzymatic activities of glutathione S-transferases (GST) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase. Further studies indicated that chlorogenic acid could stimulate the nuclear translocation of Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor) as well as subsequent induction of GSTA1 antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated GST activity. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway might be involved in the activation of Nrf2 translocation. These results provide the first evidence that chlorogenic acid could protect against environmental carcinogen-induced carcinogenesis and suggest that the chemopreventive effects of chlorogenic acid may be through its up-regulation of cellular antioxidant enzymes and suppression of ROS-mediated NF-κB, AP-1, and MAPK activation.

Epidemiological evidence demonstrates that consumption of healthy foods containing phytochemical compounds might reduce the incidence of cancer and chronic degenerative diseases (1Tamimi R.M. Lagiou P. Adami H.O. Trichopoulos D. J. Intern. Med. 2002; 251: 286-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Chlorogenic acid, the ester of caffeic acid with quinic acid, is one of the most abundant polyphenols in human diet and has been reported to decrease the incidence of chemical carcinogenesis in several animal models of cancer (2Huang M.T. Smart R.C. Wong C.Q. Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5941-5946PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kasai H. Fukada S. Yamaizumi Z. Sugie S. Mori H. Food Chem. Toxicol. 2000; 38: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms for its anti-carcinogenic properties are poorly understood. Thus, elucidation of such mechanisms of action is essential before the possibility for chlorogenic acid application in chemoprevention can be considered. AP-1 1The abbreviations used are: AP-1, activator protein-1; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinases; MAPKK, MAPK kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MKK4, MAP kinase kinase 4 (alternatively designated SEK1 or MEK4); NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; ECIS, electric cell-substrate impedance sensing; ROS, reactive oxygen species; ARE, antioxidant response element; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PI, phosphatidylinositol. and/or NF-κB signal transduction pathways are known to be important molecular targets of chemopreventive strategies (4Li J.J.

Toxicol. 2002; 42: 25-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Activation of AP-1 or NF-κB induces the expression of target genes that are involved in many disease processes, such as inflammation, neoplastic transformation, tumor progression, metastasis, and angiogenesis (5Bode A.M. Dong Z. Lancet Oncol. 2000; 1: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Yang S.C. Maliakal P. Meng X. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

AP-1 activity has been shown to be involved in the tumor promotion and progression of various types of cancers (4Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bode A.M. Dong Z. Lancet Oncol. 2000; 1: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 6Yang S.C. Maliakal P. Meng X. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 25-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Active NF-κB is found in the nucleus of many different cancer cells (8Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). The potential proapoptotic effect of NF-κB on normal cells and its antiapoptotic and cytoprotective effect on tumor cells have also been reviewed (8Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 740-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 9Sonis S.T. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 2002; 13: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The components of AP-1 are activated by three distinct but parallel MAPKs: ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase. Each consists of a module of three kinases: MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MAPKK) that is responsible for the phosphorylation of MAPK, and a MAPKK kinase that phosphorylates and activates MAPKK (10Cano E. Mahadevan L.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 117-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 11Ding M. Shi X. Dong Z. Chen F. Lu Y. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30611-30616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). NF-κB can also be activated at the MAPKK kinase level, by MAPK/ERK kinase 1 or 3 (5Bode A.M. Dong Z. Lancet Oncol. 2000; 1: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 12Yang J. Lin Y. Guo Z. Cheng J. Huang J. Deng L. Liao W. Chen Z. Liu Z. Su B. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). AP-1, NF-κB, and associated MAPK signal transduction pathways are believed to be crucial in cell transformation and tumor promotion (13Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J.

Because of the critical roles of NF-κB, AP-1, and MAPK signaling in carcinogenesis, they have been proposed as targets for chemopreventive agents (5Bode A.M. Dong Z. Lancet Oncol. 2000; 1: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the induced AP-1 activity and neoplastic transformation can be blocked by chemopreventive agents, such as pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (4Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar), tea polyphenols (6Yang S.C. Maliakal P. Meng X. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 25-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), resveratrol (17Yu R. Hebbar V. Kim D.W. Mandlekar S. Pezzuto J.M. Kong A.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and blackberry extract (18Feng R. Bowman L.L. Lu Y. Leonard S.S. Shi X. Jiang B.H. Castranova V. Vallyathan V. Ding M. Nutr. Cancer. 2004; 50: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Many of these inhibitory agents have been shown to be active not only in the JB6 transformation model but also in mouse skin tumor promotion in vivo (5Bode A.M. Dong Z. Lancet Oncol. 2000; 1: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the mouse epidermal cell line, JB6, provides a validated model for screening cancer chemopreventive agents and elucidating their mechanisms at the molecular level (4Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bode A.M. Dong Z. Lancet Oncol. 2000; 1: 181-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The transcription factor Nrf2 is a member of the basic leucine zipper NF-E2 family and plays an essential role in the antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated expression of phase 2 detoxifying enzymes and stress-inducible genes (19Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar, 20Motohashi H. Yamamoto M. Trends Mol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 4483-4490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Inducers of phase 2 and antioxidative enzymes are known to enhance the detoxication of environmental carcinogens in animals, often leading to protection against neoplasia (22Kensler T.W. Environ. Health Perspect. 1997; 105: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 23Balogun E. Hoque M. Gong P. Killeen E. Green C.J. Foresti R. Alam J. Motterlini R. Biochem.

Regulation of both basal and inducible expression of cytoprotective genes is mediated in part by the ARE, a cis-acting sequence found in the 5′-flanking region of genes encoding many phase 2 enzymes, including heme oxygenase-1, glutathione S-transferase (GST) A1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and Nrf2 itself (23Balogun E.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24468-24474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Among these defensive systems, GST may block JNK-induced Jun activation and subsequently inhibit mitogenic signaling induced by oncogenic Ras-p21 (28Villafania A. Anwar K. Amar S. Chie L. Way D. Chung D.L. Adler V. Ronai Z. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Yamaizumii Z. Kung H.F. Pincus M.R. Ann. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2000; 30: 57-64PubMed Google Scholar). As the endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, GST may also inhibit apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1-activated JNK and p38 signaling pathways (29Cho S.G. Lee Y.H. Park H.S. Ryoo K. Kang K.W. Park J. Eom S.J. Kim M.J. Chang T.S. Choi S.Y. Shim J. Kim Y. Dong M.S. Lee M.J. Kim S.G. Ichijo H. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12749-12755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, GSTs display broad substrate specificity and are associated with cancer chemopreventive and cytoprotective effects (26Thimmulappa R.K. Mai K.H. Srisuma S. Kensler T.W. Yamamoto M. Biswal S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5196-5203PubMed Google Scholar, 30Yoshitani S.I. Tanaka T. Kohno H. Takashima S. Int. J. Oncol. 2001; 19: 929-939PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with nrf2-disrupted mice indicated that Nrf2 was essential for the induction of GST and NQO1 activities in vivo by different classes of chemopreventive agents, including dithiole-thiones, isothiocyanates, and phenolic antioxidants (31MacMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McLellan L.I. Wolf C.R. Cavin C. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3299-3307PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kwak M.K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Sutter T.R. Kensler T.W. Mol. Med. 2001; 7: 135-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The likely importance of these protective enzymes is highlighted by recent observations that nrf2-null mice were considerably more sensitive to the tumorigenicity of benzo[a]pyrene (33Ramos-Gomez M. Kwak M.K. Dolan P.M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Kensler T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3410-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar) and form higher levels of DNA adducts following exposure to carcinogens (34Ramos-Gomez M. Dolan P.M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Kensler T.W. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, the induction of phase 2 gene expression is an effective strategy for achieving protection against carcinogenesis (22Kensler T.W. Environ. Health Perspect. 1997; 105: 965-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Given the animal data suggesting cancer prevention properties of chlorogenic acid, we tested the effects of chlorogenic acid on proliferation of cancer cells and neoplastic transformation induced by tumor promoter in JB6 cells. To elucidate the mechanism of the anti-tumorigenic effect of chlorogenic acid, we also investigated the effects of chlorogenic acid on NF-κB, AP-1, and MAPK activation induced by tumor promotors as well as on the induction of Nrf2 transactivation and phase 2 enzyme activities. Our results demonstrate possible chemoprevention activity of chlorogenic acid and characterize mechanisms of the inhibitory actions on tumor promotion and the inductive effects on Nrf2 transactivation and phase 2 enzyme activity. Materials—Chlorogenic acid, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, NADP, FAD, menadione, glucose 6-phosphate, yeast glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) were purchased from Sigma. LY294002 was obtained from Calbiochem. Eagle's minimal essential medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were obtained from Whittaker Biosciences (Walkersville, MD). Opti-MEM I medium was from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), gentamicin, and l-glutamine were purchased from Invitrogen. Fugene 6 Transfection reagent was from Roche Applied Science. Antibody against MKK4 or Nrf2 was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Phospho-SEK1/MKK4 and PhosphoPlus MAPK antibody kits were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverley, MA). The luciferase assay kit was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Plasmids and Cell Culture—AP-1 or NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid is the construct containing the collagenase promoter bearing AP-1- or NF-κB-binding sites that drives a luciferase reporter gene. A DNA sequence containing the GST A1 ARE (-833 to -533 from the start codon) was prepared by PCR from the mouse GST A1 promoter (-1094 to -10), which was isolated from mouse brain cDNA and inserted into a luciferase reporter vector (ARE-TATA Luc+) (35Kwak M.K. Kensler T.W. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The JB6 promotion-sensitive (P+) mouse epidermal cell line and JB6 cells, stably transfected with either AP-1-luciferase reporter plasmid (4Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar) or a NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid (a gift from Dr. Chuanshu Huang, New York University School of Medicine), were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 5% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin. The human lung cancer epithelial cell line, A549, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. In all experiments, exponentially growing cells were used. Assay of the Antioxidant Capacity of Chlorogenic Acid—The antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acid was determined using a 2,2′-azio-diethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate test set (Randox Laboratories Ltd.). The principle of the assay depends on production of the radical cation 2,2′-azio-diethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate+ in incubation medium containing the substrates (H2O2 and peroxidase), which is a blue-green color and can be detected at 600 nm. Antioxidants in the sample cause the suppression of this color production to a degree that is proportional to their concentrations. The assays were calibrated against standards and expressed as μmol/liter. Assay of AP-1 or NF-κB Activity—Confluent monolayers of JB6 stable transfectants were trypsinized, and 2 × 104 viable cells suspended in 0.5 ml of Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% FBS were seeded to each well of a 48-well plate. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The medium was then switched to 0.1% FBS Eagle's minimal essential medium and culture for 24 h to minimize basal activity of AP-1 or NF-κB. The cells were pretreated with or without chlorogenic acid for 1 h and then exposed to TPA (20 ng/ml) or UVB (4 kJ/m2) irradiation. The cells were extracted with 100 μl of 1× lysis buffer provided in the luciferase assay kit by the manufacturer. Luciferase activity was measured using a Monolight luminometer, model 3010. The results are presented as relative AP-1 or NF-κB activity compared with untreated controls (36Ding M. Lu Y. Bowman L. Huang C. Leonard S. Wang L. Vallyathan V. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cell Proliferation Assay by Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing (ECIS)—The ECIS model 1600R (Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY) was used to measure the influence of chlorogenic acid on the proliferation of human cancer A549 cells or JB6 cells. The ECIS assay has been used for continuous measurement of cell micromotion, attachment, spreading, and growth (37Lo C.M. Keese C.R. Giaever I. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 2800-2807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 38Giaever I. Keese C.R. Nature. 1993; 366: 591-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). The cells (1 × 104) were suspended in 400 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without chlorogenic acid and seeded on electrodes. The cells were equilibrated in the incubator for 15 min. The rate of cell proliferation on the microelectrode was monitored for 72 h as real-time changes in resistance. Anchorage-independent Transformation Assay—The effect of chlorogenic acid on TPA-induced cell transformation was investigated in JB6 P+ cells using the soft agar assay as described previously (4Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar, 39Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The cells (1 × 104) were exposed to TPA (20 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of different concentrations of chlorogenic acid, in 1 ml of 0.33% basal medium Eagle agar containing 15% FBS over 3.5 ml of 0.5% agar containing 15% FBS Eagle's minimal essential medium. The cultures were maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2 weeks, and the anchorage-independent colonies were counted. Protein Kinase Phosphorylation Assay—The cells were extracted with 1× SDS sample buffer. Immunoblots for phosphorylation of ERKs, JNKs, and p38 kinase were carried out as described in the protocol of the manufacturer, using phosphospecific antibodies against phosphorylated sites of ERKs, JNK, and p38 kinase. Nonphosphospecific antibodies against ERKs and p38 kinase proteins provided in the assay kits were used to normalize the phosphorylation assay, using the same transferred membrane blot (36Ding M. Lu Y. Bowman L. Huang C. Leonard S. Wang L. Vallyathan V. Castranova V. Shi X. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10670-10676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Enzyme Activity Assay—The activities of the typical phase 2 enzymes, NQO1 and GST, were measured spectrophotometrically as described previously (35Kwak M.K. Kensler T.W. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the NQO1 assay, the cells were grown in 96-well plates, treated with chlorogenic acid, and lysed by 0.8% digitonin. The reaction solution (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.06% bovine serum albumin, 5 μm FAD, 1 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 30 μm NADP, 300 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 725 μm 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, and 50 μm menadione) was added into the wells, and the reduced 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide was measured at 610 nm. NQO1 induction by chlorogenic acid was expressed as ratios of treated over vehicle control (35Kwak M.K. Kensler T.W. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For total GST assay, JB6 cells were incubated with chlorogenic acid and then lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Triton X-100) for 30 min. Cytosolic fractions were prepared by centrifugation and stored at -70 °C until use. Assays were conducted in a thermostated compartment at 25 °C, using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as the substrate. Cytosolic protein (45 μg) was added to 800 μl of reaction mixture containing 100 mm KH2PO4 (pH 6.5) and 1 mm glutathione. The reaction was initiated by adding 1 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, and the formation of thioether at 5 min was measured at 340 nm. Total enzymatic activity of GST was expressed as nmol/min/mg protein. Immunocytochemistry of Nrf2—After treatment with chlorogenic acid for 3 h, JB6 cells grown on Lab-TEK chamber slides were fixed in 100% methanol for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h. The cells were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-Nrf2 antibody (1:100) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4 °C. After they were washed four times with PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for an additional 1 h in the dark. Counterstaining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole verified the location and integrity of nuclei. Stained cells were washed and examined using a laser-scanning confocal microscope, Zeiss LSM 510 (Thornwood, NY). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts and Nrf2 Nuclear Translocation Assay—Nuclear extracts from JB6 cells were prepared as described previously (15Chen F. Ding M. Lu Y. Leonard S.S. Vallyathan V.

The cells were suspended in hypotonic buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 10 min on ice and then vortexed for 10 s. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 s and were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 25% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice. The supernatants containing nuclear proteins were collected after centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 2 min and stored at -70 °C. Proteins that were extracted from either whole cell lysate (30 μg) or nuclei (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and detected with an Nrf2 antibody. Transfection of Plasmids and Measurement of Luciferase Activity—A DNA sequence containing mouse GST A1 ARE (-833 to -533 from the start codon) was inserted into a luciferase reporter pGL3-Basic vector (ARE-TATA Luc+) as described previously (35Kwak M.K. Kensler T.W. Casero Jr., R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 305: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). JB6 cells were plated on 24-well plates at density of 50–60% confluence. The transfection complex containing 0.5 μg of plasmid DNA in Opti-MEM I medium was added to each well. The cells were treated with chlorogenic acid for 18 h following transient transfection of ARE-TATA Luc+. Luciferase activity was measured using the luciferase assay kit as described above. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E. of n experiments/samples as noted in the figure legends. Significant differences were determined using Student's t test. Significance was set at p ≤ 0.05. The Total Antioxidant Capacity of Chlorogenic Acid—Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been known to be mutagenic and associated with many diseases. In light of the important role of ROS in tumor promoter-induced AP-1 activation, transformation, and tumor promotion, we measured the antioxidant capacity of chlorogenic acid using the Randox reagent set. As shown in Fig. 1, chlorogenic acid displayed stronger antioxidant activity than that of ascorbic acid over the same concentration range, indicating that chlorogenic acid can effectively scavenge reactive oxygen radicals. Chlorogenic Acid Inhibits the Proliferation of Cancer Cells— The effect of chlorogenic acid on proliferation of a human lung cancer cell line, A549, was determined using the ECIS assay. Cells were grown in the electrode array wells and treated with chlorogenic acid for 72 h. The ECIS resistance, indicating the number of cells in the wells, was monitored for the duration of the experiment. At a concentration of 80 μm, proliferation of A549 cells was significantly suppressed (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, chlorogenic acid had little effect on the proliferation of JB6 cells at the same dose (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that chlorogenic acid may preferentially inhibit tumor cell growth. Effects of Chlorogenic Acid on TPA- or UVB-induced AP-1 and NF-κB Activation—Previous studies have shown that either AP-1 or NF-κB activation is required for neoplastic transformation in JB6 cells (4Li J.J. Westergaard C. Ghosh P. Colburn N.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3569-3576PubMed Google Scholar, 5Bode A.M. Dong Z.

We thus tested the effects of chlorogenic acid on TPA- or UVB-induced AP-1 and NF-κB activity, using a reporter gene assay. Pretreatment of cells with chlorogenic acid markedly inhibited TPA-induced AP-1 and NF-κB activity over a similar concentration range (Fig. 3, A and B). At a concentration of 40 μm chlorogenic acid, TPA-induced AP-1 or NF-κB activation was suppressed by 30 or 42%, respectively. Chlorogenic acid alone had no effect on AP-1 or NF-κB activity. These inhibitory effects were not due to the cytotoxicity of chlorogenic acid on JB6 cells, since the ECIS assay indicated that the proliferation of JB6 cells was not affected by chlorogenic acid even at a concentration of 80 μm (Fig. 2B). It is well known that UVB irradiation acts both a"

Here we demonstrated that human (h) PrxII, a cytosolic isotype of human 2-Cys Prx, has dual functions as a peroxidase and a molecular chaperone, and that these different functions are closely associated with its adoption of distinct protein structures. Upon exposure to oxidative stress, hPrxII assumes a high molecular weight complex structure that has a highly efficient chaperone function. However, the subsequent removal of stressors induces the dissociation of this protein structure into low molecular weight proteins and triggers a chaperone-to-peroxidase functional switch. The formation of a high molecular weight hPrxII complex depends on the hyperoxidation of its N-terminal peroxidatic Cys residue as well as on its C-terminal domain, which contains a “YF motif” that is exclusively found in eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs. A C-terminally truncated hPrxII exists as low and oligomeric protein species and does not respond to oxidative stress. Moreover, this C-terminal deletion of hPrxII converted it from an oxidation-sensitive to a hyperoxidation-resistant form of peroxidase. When functioning as a chaperone, hPrxII protects HeLa cells from H2O2-induced cell death, as measured by a terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis.

Science. 2003; 300: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). In addition to functioning in hydrogen peroxide catalysis, 2-Cys Prxs have been shown to regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activity (3.Veal E.A. Findlay V.J. Day A.M. Bozonet S.M. Evans J.M. Quinn J. Morgan B.A. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 129-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and to modulate the activity of NF-κB, a master transcription factor (4.Kang S.W.

Furthermore, numerous 2-Cys Prxs have been associated with various cellular phenomena, including cell proliferation and growth control, differentiation, immune responses, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis (8.Hirotsu S.

Specifically, it was reported that 2-Cys Prxs were overexpressed in several cancers (9.Noh D.Y. Ahn S.J. Lee R.A. Kim S.W. Chae H.Z.

In cancer cells, their expression was also found to correlate positively with the degree of resistance to apoptosis induced by radiation therapy (15.Chen W.C. McBride W.H. Iwamoto K.S. Barber C.L.

Powis G. Mol. Cancer Res. 2003; 1: 682-689PubMed Google Scholar). With regard to neurodegenerative disorders, it is well known that the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) is involved in the development of age-dependent neurodegeneration (17.Mu Z.M. Yin X.Y. Prochownik E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43175-43184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18.Kim H. Lee T.H. Park E.S. Suh J.M. Park S.J. Chung H.K. Kwon O.Y. Kim Y.K. Ro H.K. Shong M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18266-18270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). It was therefore speculated that antioxidant proteins, including 2-Cys Prxs, are up-regulated in these disorders in an attempt by the body to protect the neural cells from oxidative stress. However, given that 2-Cys Prxs have significantly lower catalytic efficiencies than catalases or glutathione peroxidases and that they exhibit a marked susceptibility to inactivation during the H2O2 catalytic process (19.Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), it is not likely that their high expression in diverse human diseases solely reflects their peroxidase function. More importantly, we recently identified a novel molecular chaperone function of the cytosolic form of the 2-Cys Prxs (cPrxI and -II) in yeast (20.Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). We found that these proteins play dual roles as peroxidases and molecular chaperones and that these distinct functions are sensitively regulated by heat shock and/or oxidative stress. With the help of sulfiredoxin (Srx1), the hyperoxidized 2-Cys Prxs can be restored to their active forms in a reversible manner in vivo (21.Biteau B. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Nature. 2003; 425: 980-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). These observations, along with the high degree of amino acid sequence conservation between human and yeast 2-Cys Prxs and their similar catalytic properties, prompted us to assess here whether human Prxs (hPrxs) also exhibit this chaperone function and to investigate their functional role in human cells. On the basis of our previous study on yeast cytosolic 2-Cys Prxs (20.Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), we selected hPrxII from the six human Prx isotypes as the primary target of our experiments. This was because only four (hPrxI-IV) of the six human Prx isoforms have two conserved Cys residues and therefore belong to the 2-Cys Prx family, and of these four isotypes, only hPrx I and II localize to the cytosol (4.Kang S.W. Chang T.-S. Lee T.-H. Kim E.S. Yu D.Y. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2535-2543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Moreover, as the second or third most abundant antioxidant enzyme in mammalian cells, the physiological role of mammalian PrxII is critical, as evidenced by the observation that PrxII-null mutant mice develop hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly at early ages (22.Lee T.H. Kim S.U. Yu S.L. Kim S.H. Park D.S. Moon H.B. Dho S.H. Kwon K.S. Kwon H. Lee J. Han Y.H. Jeong S. Kang S.W. Shin H.S. Lee K.K. Rhee S.G. Yu D.Y. Blood. 2003; 101: 5033-5038Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In addition, we chose hPrxII because many proteins have been reported to interact with the hPrxI protein (17.Mu Z.M. Yin X.Y. Prochownik E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43175-43184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which would have complicated the interpretation of data obtained in our in vivo experiments. Thus, to investigate the functional roles of hPrxII in vivo, we expressed either native- or peroxidase-inactive mutant hPrxII in HeLa cells. In addition, on the basis of recent data describing the role that the C-terminal tail of 2-Cys Prxs plays in regulating their activity (23.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar), we examined the significance of the C-terminal domain of hPrxII in controlling its dual functions. This region of the protein contains a “YF (tyrosine-phenylalanine) motif” that is peculiar to eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs (24.Sayed A.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26159-26166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that in addition to its peroxidase function, hPrxII exhibits chaperone activity. We also provide evidence that these dual functions are regulated by both the redox-sensitive N-terminal peroxidatic Cys residue and the C-terminal “YF motif of the protein. Finally, we reveal that the chaperone function of hPrxII plays a major role in mediating cytoprotection, as it confers apoptotic resistance against oxidative stress in HeLa cells. Cell Culture and Materials—HeLa cells were adapted to suspension growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen). The cells were grown to a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml and maintained by dilution with fresh complete medium every 4 days. Citrate synthase (CS), insulin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), H2O2, NADPH, and CHAPS were obtained from Sigma, and α-synuclein and an antibody against it were provided by Dr. Kang (Cheongju University, Korea). A terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) detection kit was purchased from Roche Applied Science. High performance liquid chromatography columns, TSK G4000SWXL (7.8 × 300), were from Tosoh. Anti-His tag antibody was obtained from Invitrogen, and the antibodies against Prx-SO3 and hPrxII were purchased from Labfrontier (Korea). Cloning and Mutation of the Human PrxII Gene and Expression of the Protein in Escherichia coli—The hPrxII gene was cloned from a human placental cDNA library by PCR. A C51S mutant hPrxII protein (C51S), a C-terminally truncated hPrxII lacking six amino acids from its C terminus including the YF motif (ΔC-ter), and a double mutant (DM) form of hPrxII containing both the C51S mutation and the ΔC-ter truncation were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis as described (19.Yang K.S.

The glutathione S-transferase-fused hPrxII obtained using a GSH-agarose column was then cleaved by thrombin, and the mature hPrxII was purified as described previously (20.Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Protein structures and apparent molecular weights of hPrxII were analyzed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a TSK G4000SWXL column and native-PAGE, as described previously (20.Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y.

Determination of Thioredoxin (Trx)-dependent Peroxidase and Chaperone Activities—Trx-dependent peroxidase activity of hPrxII linked to NADPH oxidation was quantified by monitoring the decrease in A340 as described (19.Yang K.S.

Chaperone activity of the protein was measured using CS, insulin β-chain, and α-synuclein as substrates (25.Kim K.S. Choi S.Y. Kwon H.Y. Won M.H. Kang T.C. Kang J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26.Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). Turbidity due to substrate aggregation was monitored in a DU650 spectrophotometer (Beckman Instruments) equipped with a thermostatic cell holder. Sample Preparation for PAGE and Immunoblot Analysis—To prepare samples for SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE, HeLa cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by freezing and thawing six times. After removing insoluble materials by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 30 min, the supernatants were obtained, and their protein concentration was measured by Bradford's method (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of the proteins were subjected to 10% native- or 12% SDS-PAGE. After mixing the cell lysates with 10 volumes of rehydration buffer (2% CHAPS, 8 m urea, 0.5% immobilized pH gradient buffer, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 0.008% bromphenol blue), two-dimensional PAGE was carried out as described previously (19.Yang K.S. Kang S.W. Woo H.A. Hwang S.C. Chae H.Z. Kim K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analyses of Prx enzymes, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was incubated with anti-hPrxII, anti-Prx-SO3, and anti-His tag antibodies. Oxidative Stress-dependent Structural Changes of hPrxII in Yeast Cells—To analyze H2O2-mediated structural changes of hPrxII in yeast cells, pYES2-hPrxII cDNA containing the URA3 marker was transformed into wild type yeasts under the control of the Gal1 promoter. pYES2-cPrxI served as a control. The transformed cells were grown in yeast/peptone (YP)/dextrose medium to mid-log phase and diluted in YP/galactose medium to induce hPrxII. After growing the cells to the exponential phase, the cultured cells were treated with or without 0.2 mm H2O2. Structural properties of hPrxII in the cell extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting on a native-PAGE. Transfection of Various hPrxII DNA Constructs into HeLa Cells and Preparation of Their Stable Transformants—HeLa cells were maintained at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in 10-cm culture dishes containing DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. At 80-90% confluency, cells were harvested by trypsinization, counted using a hemocytometer, and suspended in serum-free DMEM at a density of 4 × 106 cells/ml. 20 μg of various hPrxII genes ligated with the pcDNA3.1 vector and 250-μl aliquots of the cell suspensions were placed in an electroporation chamber for transient transfection. Electroporation was performed by application of a single pulse after which the electroporated cells were transferred to DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. Twenty four h after transfection, three geneticin (G-418)-resistant clonal cells overexpressing the various forms of hPrxII proteins were selected in medium containing 1 mg/ml G-418. After combining the three clonal lines overexpressing hPrxII proteins, they were amplified in medium in the presence of 0.2 mg/ml G-418. By using the cells, structural changes in the hPrxII derivatives were analyzed on a native-PAGE, and their cellular resistance against 1 mm H2O2 treatment was measured. Measurement of Cell Death by TUNEL Assay and Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting (FACS) Analysis—H2O2-induced death of HeLa cells was evaluated by TUNEL (Roche Applied Science) and FACS assays according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, HeLa cells transfected with various forms of hPrxII DNAs were cultured on glass coverslips for 12 h after H2O2 treatment. The cell-coated coverslips were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 1 h. The coverslips were then rinsed with PBS, and the cells were permeabilized by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4 °C for 2 min. Cells with fragmented nuclear DNA were detected by using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (0.5 units/μl) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dUTP (0.5 nmol/μl). Fluorescence was detected by an episcopic fluorescence microscope (Olympus, IX70) with filter combinations of DM 351/488/BA505-525. Apoptotic cells were monitored in parallel by assessing FITC-labeled annexin V staining and propidium iodide (PI) incorporation using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) as described (28.Vermes I. Haanen C. Steffens-Nakken H. Reutelingsperger C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 184: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (4607) Google Scholar). For fluorescein detection, 488 nm excitation by an argon laser and 515-nm bandpass filter were used, and a >560-nm filter was used for PI detection. All experiments were independently repeated at least three times. Chaperone Function of hPrxII—Most importantly, hPrxII has a high degree of sequence homology and shares similar biochemical properties (23.Wood Z.A. Poole L.B. Karplus P.A. Science. 2003; 300: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1144) Google Scholar) with yeast cPrxI and -II, which were shown previously to be bifunctional as both peroxidases and molecular chaperones (20.Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the potential chaperone activity of hPrxII by assessing its ability to inhibit the thermal aggregation of CS. This revealed that hPrxII efficiently suppressed thermal aggregation of CS at 43 °C, similar to yeast cPrxI, which was used as a control (Fig. 1A). No inhibition of CS aggregation was observed when BSA was used instead of hPrxII. Incubation of CS with increasing concentrations of hPrxII produced a concomitant concentration-dependent decrease in CS aggregation, and at a subunit molar ratio of hPrxII to CS of 3:1, CS aggregation was completely suppressed (Fig. 1B). This suggests that hPrxII can indeed act as an efficient molecular chaperone. We also demonstrated that hPrxII protects the insulin β-chain from dithiothreitol-induced precipitation (Fig. 1C). In addition to these model substrates, we tested the chaperone activity of hPrxII against α-synuclein, which is a key component of Lewy bodies in Parkinson and Alzheimer diseased brains and is abnormally aggregated by oxidative stress (25.Kim K.S. Choi S.Y. Kwon H.Y. Won M.H. Kang T.C. Kang J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29.Matsuzaki M. Hasegawa T. Takeda A. Kikuchi A. Furukawa K. Kato Y. Itoyama Y. Brain Res. 2004; 1004: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis indicated that ROS generated by superoxide dismutase and H2O2 induce extensive aggregation of α-synuclein, in agreement with previous reports (25.Kim K.S. Choi S.Y. Kwon H.Y. Won M.H. Kang T.C. Kang J.H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the ROS-induced denaturation and aggregation of α-synuclein were prevented by hPrxII (Fig. 1D). This suggests that the chaperone function of hPrxII is effective in preventing ROS-induced aggregation of a cytosolic protein in mammalian cells. From these results, it can be concluded that, in addition to its well known peroxidase function, hPrxII exhibits highly efficient molecular chaperone activity, as was also observed for the yeast cPrxI and -II proteins (20.Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The Dual Functions of hPrxII Are Associated with Its Protein Structures—Yeast cPrxI and -II produce multiple homo-polymeric complex forms, and we found previously that their dual peroxidase and chaperone functions were closely associated with the degree of polymerization in their protein structures (20.Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Because hPrxII exhibits strong chaperone activity (Fig. 1) and high molecular weight (high molecular weight) complex formation of a protein is a typical feature of a molecular chaperone (30.Haley D.A. Horwitz J. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), we analyzed the molecular structures of purified hPrxII by SEC. This analysis confirmed that hPrxII produces multiple forms of high molecular weight protein complexes (Fig. 2A) that have molecular masses ranging from 100 kDa to over 1,000 kDa. When we further examined the molecular sizes of each protein fraction in SEC (Fig. 2A) by immunoblotting with an anti-hPrxII antibody on a native-PAGE, multiple forms of protein complexes were detected in each fraction (Fig. 2B, upper panel). The protein sizes of hPrxII in native-PAGE were similar to those estimated by SEC. However, unlike the data obtained from native-PAGE analysis, a single protein band with a molecular mass of 22 kDa was observed upon SDS-PAGE of all the SEC-separated protein fractions. This strongly suggests that under native conditions, hPrxII exists as a homopolymeric complex consisting of variable copies of its subunit. Since we previously established that the dual functions of yeast cPrxI and -II are regulated by their protein structures (20.Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether this is also the case for the human PrxII protein using the structures separated by SEC (Fig. 2C). The molecular structures in each of the SEC-separated fractions were stable enough to facilitate analysis of their biochemical properties in vitro (data not shown). The highest molecular weight hPrxII protein complex (F-H) predominantly exhibited chaperone activity with a negligible amount of peroxidase activity, whereas the last fraction containing the lowest molecular weight proteins (F-L) displayed significant peroxidase activity and virtually no chaperone activity. In contrast, the middle-sized protein complex (F-M) demonstrated both peroxidase and chaperone activities, as did the total protein. These observations together strongly suggest that the peroxidase and chaperone activities of hPrxII are regulated by the degree of homo-polymerization in its protein structures. Effect of the N-terminal Peroxidatic Cys Residue and the C-terminal Domain of hPrxII on Its Protein Structure and Functions in Response to H2O2—During the H2O2 catalytic process, the peroxidatic Cys of 2-Cys Prxs is oxidized to sulfenic acid (Cys-SOH), which typically reacts with a proximal thiol to form an intermolecular disulfide bond (31.Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, upon exposure of yeast cells to elevated levels of H2O2, the peroxidatic Cys is hyperoxidized to sulfinic or sulfonic acid (2.Woo H.A. Chae H.Z. Hwang S.C. Yang K.-S. Kang S.W. Kim K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38029-38036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). This reaction induces significant changes in the protein structure of yeast 2-Cys Prxs and mediates the switching of their functions from peroxidases to molecular chaperones (20.Jang H.H. Lee K.O. Chi Y.H. Jung B.G. Park S.K. Park J.H. Lee J.R. Lee S.S. Moon J.C. Yun J.W. Choi Y.O. Kim W.Y. Kang J.S. Cheong G.W. Yun D.J. Rhee S.G. Cho M.J. Lee S.Y. Cell. 2004; 117: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The regulation of 2-Cys Prxs is also controlled by phosphorylation and limited proteolysis (32.Chang T.S. Jeong W. Choi S.Y. Yu S. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25370-25376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 33.Koo K.H. Lee S. Jeong S.Y. Kim E.T. Kim K. Song K. Chae H.Z. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recently, two 2-Cys Prxs have been identified from Schistosoma mansoni, one of which is sensitive to hyperoxidation by H2O2, whereas the other is remarkably resistant to hyperoxidation (24.Sayed A.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26159-26166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In that study, the authors concluded that the susceptibility of the sensitive Prx to oxidative inactivation was because of the presence of a C-terminal tail containing the YF motif. On the basis of these observations, we prepared mutant proteins of hPrxII, namely C51S-hPrxII, a C-terminally truncated protein that lacks the YF motif (ΔC-ter), and the double mutant (DM) form (Fig. 3A). By using the recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli, we investigated the changes of their protein structure and functions in the presence of various concentrations of H2O2. Unlike the native form of hPrxII, the C51S, ΔC-ter, and DM forms of hPrxII did not form higher order oligomers when treated with H2O2, even in the presence of a Trx system containing Trx, Trx reductase, and NADPH (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, unlike native hPrxII, the H2O2-catalyzing peroxidase activity of ΔC-ter was not inactivated by high concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 3C). This suggests that the C-terminal truncation converted the oxidation-sensitive form of hPrxII into an over oxidation-resistant protein. As expected, the C51S mutant did not show H2O2-catalyzing peroxidase activity. Finally, in the presence of a Trx system, although the chaperone activity of native hPrxII increased significantly upon exposure to increasing concentr"
https://openalex.org/W2103172804,"The vast majority of human cancers express telomerase activity, while most human somatic cells do not have detectable telomerase activity. Since telomerase plays a critical role in cell immortality, it is an attractive target for a selective cancer therapy. Oligonucleotides complementary to the RNA template region of human telomerase (hTR) have been shown to be effective inhibitors of telomerase and, subsequently, cancer cell growth in vitro. We show here that a lipid-modified N3′ → P5′ thio-phosphoramidate oligonucleotide (GRN163L) inhibits telomerase more potently than its parental nonconjugated thio-phosphoramidate sequence (GRN163). Cells were treated with both the first- (GRN163) and second-generation (GRN163L) oligonucleotides, including a mismatch control, with or without a transfection enhancer reagent. GRN163L inhibited telomerase activity effectively in a dose-dependent manner, even without the use of a transfection reagent. The IC50 values for GRN163 in various cell lines were on average sevenfold higher than for GRN163L. GRN163L inhibition of telomerase activity resulted in a more rapid loss of telomeres and cell growth than GRN163. This report is the first to show that lipid modification enhanced the potency of the novel GRN163 telomerase inhibitor. These results suggest that the lipid-conjugated thio-phosphoramidates could be important for improved pharmacodynamics of telomerase inhibitors in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2169533924,"Hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF) is regulated by two oxygen-dependent events that are catalyzed by the HIF prolyl 4-hydroxylases (HIF-P4Hs) and HIF asparaginyl hydroxylase (FIH). We have purified the three recombinant human HIF-P4Hs to near homogeneity and characterized their catalytic properties and inhibition and those of FIH. The specific activities of the HIF-P4Hs were at least 40-50 mol/mol/min, and they and FIH catalyzed an uncoupled decarboxylation of 2-oxoglutarate in the absence of any peptide substrate. The purified HIF-P4Hs showed considerable activities even without added Fe2+, their apparent Km values for iron being markedly lower than that of FIH. Desferrioxamine and several metals were effective inhibitors of FIH, but surprisingly, ineffective inhibitors of the HIF-P4Hs in vitro, especially of HIF-P4H-2. Desferrioxamine and cobalt were more effective in cultured insect cells synthesizing recombinant HIF-P4H-2, but complete inhibition was not achieved and most of the enzyme was inactivated irreversibly. Cobalt also rapidly inactivated HIF-P4Hs during storage at 4 degrees C. The well-known stabilization of HIF-alpha by cobalt and nickel is thus not due to a simple competitive inhibition of HIF-P4Hs. The effective inhibition of FIH by these metals and zinc probably leads to full transcriptional activity of HIF-alpha even in concentrations that produce no stabilization of HIF-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2032535754,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a common neoplasm in HIV-1-infected individuals causing significant morbidity and mortality. Despite recent advances, the pathogenesis of this potentially life-threatening neoplasm remains unclear, and there is currently no cure for KS. Notch proteins are known to play a fundamental role in cell fate decisions including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is, therefore, not surprising that Notch proteins have been implicated in tumorigenesis and appear to function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor proteins depending on cellular context. In this report, we demonstrate elevated levels of activated Notch-1, -2, and -4 in KS tumor cells in vivo and in vitro compared to endothelial cells, the precursor of the KS cell. Notch activation was confirmed through luciferase reporter assays and localization of Hes (Hairy/Enhancer of Split)-1 and Hey (Hairy/Enhancer of Split related with YRPW)1 (primary targets of the Notch pathway) in KS cell nuclei. Studies using gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI and LY-411,575), which block Notch activation, resulted in apoptosis in primary and immortalized KS cells. Similar studies injecting GSI into established KS cell tumors on mice demonstrated growth inhibition or tumor regression that was characterized by apoptosis in treated, but not control tumors. The results indicate that KS cells overexpress activated Notch and interruption of Notch signaling inhibits KS cell growth. Thus, targeting Notch signaling may be of therapeutic value in KS patients."
https://openalex.org/W2119494656,"Abnormalities in lipid metabolism have been proposed as contributing factors to both defective insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell and peripheral insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Previously, we have shown that prolonged exposure of isolated rat islets of Langerhans to excessive fatty acid levels impairs insulin gene transcription. This study was designed to assess whether palmitate alters the expression and binding activity of the key regulatory factors pancreas-duodenum homeobox-1 (PDX-1), MafA, and Beta2, which respectively bind to the A3, C1, and E1 elements in the proximal region of the insulin promoter. Nuclear extracts of isolated rat islets cultured with 0.5 mm palmitate exhibited reduced binding activity to the A3 and C1 elements but not the E1 element. Palmitate did not affect the overall expression of PDX-1 but reduced its nuclear localization. In contrast, palmitate blocked the stimulation of MafA mRNA and protein expression by glucose. Combined adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PDX-1 and MafA in islets completely prevented the inhibition of insulin gene expression by palmitate. These results demonstrate that prolonged exposure of islets to palmitate inhibits insulin gene transcription by impairing nuclear localization of PDX-1 and cellular expression of MafA.

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing dramatically in Western countries, in part because of the increase in obesity. Type 2 diabetes mellitus, the most frequent form of the disease, is characterized by defective insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cells and peripheral insulin resistance. According to the lipotoxicity hypothesis, abnormalities in lipid metabolism contribute to both defects (1Unger R.H. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5159-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) and in particular to the inexorable decline of beta cell function observed during the course of the disease (2Poitout V. Robertson R.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms of lipotoxicity in the beta cell remain largely unknown.

However, the mechanisms by which palmitate affects the insulin promoter are unknown. Both beta cell-specific expression and metabolic regulation of the insulin gene are conferred by a highly conserved region lying ∼340 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site that constitutes the promoter/enhancer region (12Stein R.

Reagents—RPMI 1640 was obtained from Invitrogen. [α-32P]UTP and [α-32P]dCTP were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) was from Serologicals Corporation (Norcross, GA). Palmitic acid (sodium salt) and all other reagents (analytical grade) were from Sigma. Animals—Normal 225–275-g male Wistar rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Animals were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to standard laboratory chow and water. All procedures using animals were approved by the Pacific Northwest Research Institute Animal Care and Use Committee. Rat Islet Isolation and Culture—Rat islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and dextran density gradient centrifugation as described previously (11Kelpe C.L. Moore P.C. Parazzoli S.D.

All control conditions contained the same amount of BSA and vehicle (EtOH/H2O, 1:1, v/v) as those with palmitate. Extraction of Total, Cytosolic, and Nuclear Proteins—Total cellular proteins were extracted from islet lysates as described previously (22Wrede C.E. Dickson L.M. Lingohr M.K. Briaud I. Rhodes C.J. J.

To separate nuclear from cytosolic proteins, batches of 350–500 islets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 400 μl of cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin), and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min before the addition of 25 μl of 10% (w/v) Nonidet P-40. After vortexing vigorously, the nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 1 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in 50 μl of high salt buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). All protein isolates were stored at -80°C. Protein content was quantified using the BCA kit (Pierce). Immunoblotting—Proteins (5–30 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and probed with primary antibodies against MafA (1:1000; Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), Beta2 (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), PDX-1 (1:5000; kindly provided by C.

Detection was performed using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on Kodak X-Mat film. Bands were quantified using Optiquant System software (Packard Instrument Co.). Immunohistochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Cultured islets were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 30 min on ice, washed twice with PBS, and embedded in 80 μl of liquefied HistoGel (Richard-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI). After hardening, the islet-HistoGel pellet was further fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 3 h on ice. Following standard ethanol dehydration and paraffin embedding, 0.4-μm sections were mounted on slides and rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed using 10 mm sodium citrate heated to 90 °C for 9 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The sections were washed with PBS twice, blocked with 5% donkey serum in PBS, 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-PDX-1 antibody diluted 1:10,000 in PBS, 1% BSA. An anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Cy5 (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) was used at 1:1000 in PBS, 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature for detection. Nuclei of the sectioned islets were detected by the addition of 1 μg/ml propidium iodide just prior to mounting with Aqua Poly/Mount (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Images were acquired using a Fluoview 500 Olympus confocal microscope.

In addition, we used an oligodeoxynucleotide probe (Zd: 5′-TTT GCT CTC CTG GAG ACA TTT GCC CCC AGC TGT GAG C-3′) to the Z mini-enhancer of the human insulin promoter (23Sander M. Griffen S.C.

Nuclear extracts (5–10 μg) were incubated with 30,000 cpm of labeled probe with or without cold competitors in a final volume adjusted to 30 μl with binding buffer (15 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 3.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 ng of poly(dI-dC)) at room temperature for 30 min. Binding reactions were resolved on 4.5% acrylamide gels run in 0.5% TBE (44.5 mm Tris, 44.5 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) for 2 h at 4 °C and visualized by autoradiography. The identity of the protein in the binding complexes was determined by supershift using antibodies against PDX-1 or MafA. The bands were quantified using Optiquant System software (Packard Instrument Co.). RNA Isolation and Real-time Fluorescence-based Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from aliquots of 100 islets as described previously (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). PCR primers and probes for the rat MafA, PDX-1, and β-actin genes were designed using the Primer Express software program (Applied Biosystems): MafA (5′-3′) forward primer, CTT CAG CAA GGA GGA GGT CAT C; reverse primer, GCG TAG CCG CGG TTC TT; probe, 6FAM-CTG AAA CAG AAG CGG CGC ACG C-TAMRA; PDX-1 (5′-3′) forward primer, CCG CGT TCA TCT CCC TTT C; reverse primer, TGC CCA CTG GC-TTTTCCA; probe, 6FAM-TGG ATG AAA TCC ACC AAA GCT CAC GC-TAMRA; and β-actin (5′-3′) forward primer, ACG AGG CCC AGA GCA AGA; reverse primer, TTG GTT ACA ATG CCG TGT TCA; probe, 6FAM-TGG GTC CTC CAC TTC ACG GCG-TAMRA. One-step RT-PCR was carried out using the Gold RT-PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector as described previously (25Tran P.O. Gleason C.E. Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1772-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as a ratio of target gene to β-actin. Ribonuclease Protection Assay (RPA)—RPAs were carried out using the direct protect lysate RPA kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) and [α-32P]UTP-labeled probes generated from a 360-bp sequence of the rat II preproinsulin gene and a conserved 245-bp sequence of the mouse β-actin gene. Protected fragments were resolved on 5% denaturing gels as described previously (11Kelpe C.L. Moore P.C. Parazzoli S.D. Wicksteed B. Rhodes C.J. Poitout V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30015-30021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The probes were determined to be in excess for each experiment. The bands were quantified using the Optiquant System software (Packard Instrument Co.). Generation of Recombinant Adenoviruses and Islet Transduction— Recombinant adenoviruses (Ad) encoding PDX-1 and MafA under the cytomegalovirus promoter were generated by the Pacific Northwest Research Institute Adenoviral Core Facility, as described previously (11Kelpe C.L. Moore P.C. Parazzoli S.D. Wicksteed B. Rhodes C.J. Poitout V. J. Biol.

Montminy (Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA) and a mouse MafA cDNA provided by R. Stein (Vanderbilt University). A recombinant Ad expressing firefly luciferase under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter was used as a control. The appropriate titer for each recombinant Ad was assessed in preliminary experiments by infecting 100 islets with increasing viral concentrations (from 105 to 1010 plaque-forming units (pfu)/islet) overnight. The islets were then washed in PBS prior to initiating experimental conditions. Statistics—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Intergroup comparisons were performed by Student's paired t test or analysis of variance with post-hoc Dunnett t test where appropriate. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Palmitate Inhibits MafA and PDX-1 Binding to Their Cognate Sequences on the Insulin Promoter in Isolated Islets—Isolated rat islets were cultured for 24, 48, or 72 h with 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm palmitate. Binding of islet nuclear extracts to the A3, C1, E1, and Zd probes was assessed by EMSA. Fig. 1A shows a representative gel after a 72-h culture. Discrete complexes were observed with each probe and disappeared in the presence of excess unlabeled probes. The presence of MafA and PDX-1, respectively, in the complexes formed with the C1 and A3 probes was confirmed by super-shifting the bands with specific antibodies. The presence of 16.7 mm glucose visibly enhanced the intensity of the binding complex to the C1 probe and, to a lesser extent, to the A3 and E1 probes. The addition of 0.5 mm palmitate markedly reduced binding to the C1 and A3 elements in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose (Fig. 1A). Binding to the E1 and Zd sites was not affected by palmitate. The loss of binding to the A3 and C1 elements in the presence of 0.5 mm palmitate at elevated glucose (16.7 mm) was detectable after 24 h of culture and statistically significant after 48 h (p < 0.05) and 72 h (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that palmitate specifically impairs the binding activity of MafA and PDX-1 to their cognate sequences on the insulin promoter in the presence of high glucose levels in beta cells, consistent with our previous observation that palmitate blunts glucose activation of an insulin promoter-reporter (11Kelpe C.L. Moore P.C. Parazzoli S.D. Wicksteed B. Rhodes C.J. Poitout V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30015-30021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Palmitate Alters PDX-1 Nuclear Localization and MafA Gene Expression—To determine whether the loss of binding activity observed in Fig. 1 was because of diminished protein expression or altered localization, expression of PDX-1, MafA, and Beta2 in whole-cell, nuclear, or cytosolic protein extracts of rat islets cultured for 24 h in 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose in the absence or presence of 0.5 mm palmitate was assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). Expression of PDX-1 in whole-cell lysates was not significantly affected by either glucose or palmitate (Fig. 2A). At 16.7 mm glucose, PDX-1 was predominantly localized in the nuclear fraction as shown by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2, A and B). In the presence of palmitate, however, the expression of PDX-1 in the nucleus was reduced (Fig. 2, A–C). These results suggest that palmitate impairs the translocation of PDX-1 from the cytosol to the nucleus that normally occurs upon glucose stimulation (26Rafiq I. Kennedy H.J. Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23241-23247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 27Macfarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M. Felton-Edkins Z.A. Cragg H. James R.F. Docherty K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1011-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). At 2.8 mm glucose, MafA expression was undetectable in whole-cell lysates by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). In contrast, at 16.7 mm glucose MafA protein was readily detected, demonstrating a strong stimulation of MafA protein expression by glucose. In the presence of palmitate, glucose-induced MafA protein expression was reduced, on average, by 44 ± 3% (n = 7; p < 0.001) in whole-cell lysates (Fig. 2, A and D). MafA protein was undetectable in the cytosolic fraction, and its levels in the nuclear fractions were reduced by 47 ± 7% by palmitate (n = 5; p < 0.01; Fig. 2, A and D), in parallel with its reduced expression in whole-cell lysates. These results indicate that palmitate inhibits glucose-induced MafA protein expression. Neither Beta2 nor the control protein transcription factor IID was affected by palmitate. To further investigate the mechanisms by which palmitate affects protein expression, MafA and PDX-1 mRNA levels were measured in islets after a 24-h culture in 2.8 or 16.7 mm glucose with or without 0.5 mm palmitate (Fig. 3A). Glucose significantly increased MafA mRNA expression (n = 7; p < 0.01). In the presence of palmitate, the stimulatory effect of glucose was no longer significant (Fig. 3A). The time course of this inhibitory effect is shown in Fig. 3B. In contrast, neither glucose nor palmitate had a significant effect on the expression of PDX-1 mRNA (Fig. 3A), consistent with the unaltered total protein expression observed (Fig. 2, A and C). These results indicate that palmitate affects PDX-1 and MafA binding activities by two distinct mechanisms: PDX-1 is altered at the post-translational level in its nuclear localization, whereas palmitate inhibits glucose stimulation of MafA mRNA levels. Adenoviral Co-expression of PDX-1 and MafA Prevents Palmitate Inhibition of Insulin Gene Expression—To further explore the roles of PDX-1 and MafA in mediating palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression, we next sought to determine whether overexpression of these transcription factors could restore insulin mRNA expression in the presence of palmitate. First, isolated islets were infected with adenoviruses encoding for PDX-1 or MafA at a titer of 105 pfu/islet, and expression of the proteins was examined by immunoblotting after 24, 48, or 72 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, protein expression was sustained for up to 72 h. Next, to determine whether the overexpressed proteins were functional, islets were infected with increasing titers of each virus, and the binding activity of islet nuclear extracts to the A3 and C1 elements was examined by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 4B, binding of overexpressed PDX-1 and MafA to their respective sequences exceeded endogenous levels and increased with increasing viral titers. For subsequent experiments, the lowest titer of virus (105 pfu/islet) was used. Islets infected with PDX-1, MafA, or both were then cultured for 72 h in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose with or without 0.5 mm palmitate. Insulin gene expression was measured by RPA (Fig. 4C) and quantified (Fig. 4D). As shown previously (10Briaud I. Harmon J.S. Kelpe C.L. Segu V.B. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 11Kelpe C.L. Moore P.C. Parazzoli S.D. Wicksteed B. Rhodes C.J. Poitout V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30015-30021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), palmitate significantly decreased insulin gene expression after 72 h in control, luciferase-infected islets (p < 0.01). Overexpression of MafA alone increased insulin gene expression relative to that of the luciferase-infected control islets at 16.7 mm glucose. Paradoxically, overexpression of PDX-1 reduced insulin mRNA levels. In the presence of palmitate, neither MafA nor PDX-1 alone was able to prevent the decrease in insulin gene expression (Fig. 4C). However, combined overexpression of MafA and PDX-1 completely prevented the inhibitory effect of palmitate on insulin gene expression (Fig. 4, C and D), confirming the key role of these two transcription factors in the mechanisms of lipotoxicity on the insulin gene. The aims of this study were to determine whether prolonged exposure of isolated rat islets to palmitate alters the binding activity of MafA, PDX-1, and Beta2 to the insulin promoter, to ascertain whether this effect was due to reduced expression or post-translational modifications of these transcription factors, and to determine whether overexpression of these proteins could prevent palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression. Our results show that exposure of rat islets to elevated levels of palmitate inhibits binding of MafA and PDX-1 but not Beta2 to the insulin promoter. Interestingly, the mechanisms of this inhibition differ in that palmitate alters the cellular localization of PDX-1 by preventing its translocation to the nucleus, whereas glucose-stimulated MafA mRNA expression is blunted, resulting in reduced overall MafA protein levels. Importantly, palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression is prevented by combined overexpression of MafA and PDX-1. We (9Jacqueminet S. Briaud I. Rouault C. Reach G. Poitout V.

Metabolism. 2001; 50: 613-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have shown previously that concurrent exposure to chronically elevated levels of glucose and palmitate inhibits insulin gene expression. Importantly, this inhibitory effect of palmitate was observed to occur at the transcriptional level (11Kelpe C.L. Moore P.C. Parazzoli S.D. Wicksteed B. Rhodes C.J. Poitout V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30015-30021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that the mechanisms of this transcriptional inhibition involve two key transcription factors of the insulin gene, PDX-1 and MafA. Although reduced binding of PDX-1 and MafA to the A3 and C1 elements, respectively, was demonstrated indirectly by EMSA (Fig. 1), the observation that palmitate decreases nuclear localization of PDX-1 and mRNA expression of MafA indicates that the major site of action of palmitate lies upstream of the binding activities of the transcription factors. Insulin gene expression is highly regulated by glucose, which coordinately enhances both the rate of transcription and mRNA stability (14Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that binding to the A3 and C1 elements is modulated by glucose (reviewed in Ref. 14Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). A major site of glucose regulation of PDX-1 function is at the post-translational level (14Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Although the precise nature of the post-translational modifications is still debated, glucose promotes nuclear translocation of PDX-1 (26Rafiq I. Kennedy H.J. Rutter G.A. J. Biol.

Rutter G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23241-23247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 36Wang X. Cahill C.M. Pineyro M.A. Zhou J. Doyle M.E. Egan J.M.

Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1820-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we observed no glucose-induced increase in total PDX-1 protein expression (Fig. 2, A and C). Palmitate did not inhibit PDX-1 expression but significantly reduced its nuclear localization (Fig. 2, A–C). Interestingly, at 48 h both Gremlich et al. (28Gremlich S. Bonny C. Waeber G. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30261-30269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and Yoshikawa et al. (29Yoshikawa H. Tajiri Y. Sako Y. Hashimoto T. Umeda F. Nawata H. Metabolism. 2001; 50: 613-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) observed that PDX-1 mRNA expression was substantially reduced in the presence of palmitate. In our experiments, we did not observe either a glucose-induced increase or a palmitate-mediated decrease in PDX-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A). Rather, the most compelling effect of palmitate after 24 h of exposure was at the level of PDX-1 nuclear localization (Fig. 2, A–C). Because PDX-1 is thought to regulate its own transcription (38Marshak S. Benshushan E. Shoshkes M. Havin L. Cerasi E. Melloul D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7583-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 39Gerrish K. Van Velkinburgh J.C. Stein R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 533-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we postulate that the early defect seen in the presence of palmitate is a sequestration in the cytosol, which, at later time points, might also result in decreased overall cellular expression of PDX-1, as observed by Gremlich et al. (28Gremlich S. Bonny C. Waeber G. Thorens B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30261-30269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and Yoshikawa et al. (29Yoshikawa H. Tajiri Y. Sako Y. Hashimoto T. Umeda F. Nawata H. Metabolism. 2001; 50: 613-618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, Kharroubi et al. (40Kharroubi I. Ladriere L. Cardozo A.K. Dogusan Z. Cnop M. Eizirik D.L. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) failed to observe a decrease in PDX-1 expression in both INS-1 cells and rat islets after 24-h treatment with palmitate. Binding to the C1 element was markedly increased in response to glucose (Fig. 1). MafA has only recently been identified as the activator of the C1 element (18Olbrot M. Rud J. Moss L.G. Sharma A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6737-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 20Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6049-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and is localized exclusively in the nucleus of pancreatic beta cells (Fig. 2A and Ref. 20Matsuoka T.A. Zhao L. Artner I. Jarrett H.W. Friedman D. Means A. Stein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6049-6062Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). At low glucose concentrations, MafA protein levels are essentially undetectable (Fig. 2A and Ref. 19Kataoka K. Han S.I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49903-49910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). As shown here with rat islets (Figs. 2 and 3) and previously in MIN6 cells (19Kataoka K. Han S.I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49903-49910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), glucose significantly enhances mRNA and protein expression of MafA. Importantly, our results demonstrate for the first time that palmitate inhibits glucose stimulation of MafA mRNA (Fig. 3) and, as a consequence, its protein expression (Fig. 2), providing an additional mechanism whereby this fatty acid impairs insulin gene transcription. As a trans-activator of the insulin gene, MafA alone has a much greater effect than either PDX-1 or Beta2 (19Kataoka K. Han S.I. Shioda S. Hirai M. Nishizawa M. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49903-49910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In this study, adenoviral overexpression of MafA enhanced insulin gene expression, suggesting that MafA might be a factor limiting transcription of the insulin gene in rat islets. This is further supported by the recent observation that MafA binds to and activates elements of the PDX-1 promoter (41Samaras S.E. Zhao L. Means A. Henderson E. Matsuoka T.A. Stein R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12263-12270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of PDX-1 actually reduced insulin mRNA levels in islets (Fig. 4C). This phenomenon has been described previously (17Marshak S. Totary H. Cerasi E. Melloul D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15057-15062Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 42Seijffers R. Ben-David O. Cohen Y. Karasik A. Berezin M. Newgard C.B. Ferber S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3311-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was suggested to result from the titration of co-activators by the overexpressed protein (17Marshak S. Totary H. Cerasi E. Melloul D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15057-15062Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Importantly, combined overexpression of MafA and PDX-1 completely prevented palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression. This observation identifies MafA and PDX-1 as critical targets of lipotoxicity at the level of the insulin gene. We previously demonstrated that palmitate inhibition of insulin gene expression requires de novo synthesis of ceramide (11Kelpe C.L. Moore P.C. Parazzoli S.D. Wicksteed B. Rhodes C.J. Poitout V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30015-30021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The results of the present study raise the question as to how ceramide might affect PDX-1 and MafA. Although the signaling mechanisms of PDX-1 regulation by glucose are still debated, involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway has been suggested (27Macfarlane W.M. McKinnon C.M.

Because ceramide has been shown to interfere with this pathway, particularly at the level of protein kinase B in all cell types tested thus far (44Summers S.A. Nelson D.H. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 591-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), it is tempting to speculate that ceramide might dampen a stimulatory signal from glucose to PDX-1 via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. Alternatively, ceramide may activate c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase in beta cells as it does in other cells (45Mathias S. Pena L.A. Kolesnick R.N. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 46Ruvolo P.P. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 47: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In beta cells, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase activation has been shown to inhibit PDX-1 binding (47Kaneto H. Xu G. Fujii N. Kim S. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol.

Watada H. Leibiger I.B. Yamasaki Y. Hori M. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2896-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These hypotheses are currently under investigation in our laboratory. The mode of regulation of MafA by glucose is essentially unknown. Our results suggest that palmitate inhibition of MafA expression is at the transcriptional level. Elucidating the mechanisms of these effects awaits characterization of the promoter/enhancer region of the MafA gene. In conclusion, this study uniquely demonstrates that the mechanisms by which palmitate impairs insulin gene transcription involve reduced binding of PDX-1 and MafA to the insulin promoter. Interestingly, both factors are affected at different levels by palmitate: PDX-1 is affected post-translationally in its nuclear localization, whereas MafA is affected at the transcriptional level. The importance of these observations for the mechanisms of lipotoxicity is illustrated by the complete prevention of the decrease in insulin gene expression in the presence of palmitate observed after combined overexpression of PDX-1 and MafA. Although the contribution of fatty acid inhibition of insulin gene transcription to beta cell dysfunction in human type 2 diabetes remains to be established, it has been shown in rodents that intact regulation of insulin gene expression by glucose is required to maintain adequate intracellular insulin stores in the face of increased demand (49Leibowitz G.

PCC 6803 encodes a group 2 σ factor for RNA polymerase and has been proposed to function in transcriptional regulation of nitrogen metabolism. By using microarray and Northern analyses, we demonstrated that the abundance of transcripts derived from genes important for glycolysis, the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, and glycogen catabolism is reduced in a sigE mutant of Synechocystis maintained under the normal growth condition. Furthermore, the activities of the two key enzymes of the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phophogluconate dehydrogenase, encoded by the zwf and gnd genes were also reduced in the sigE mutant. The dark enhancements in both enzyme activity and transcript abundance apparent in the wild type were eliminated by the mutation. In addition, the sigE mutant showed a reduced rate of glucose uptake and an increased intracellular level of glycogen. Moreover, it was unable to proliferate under the light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions. These results indicate that SigE functions in the transcriptional activation of sugar catabolic pathways in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The sigE gene of Synechocystis sp.

Cyanobacteria, which constitute one of the largest taxonomic groups of eubacteria, perform oxygenic photosynthesis similar to higher plants and algae. Despite the diversity in their morphology, physiology, and cellular development, all cyanobacteria are able to assimilate inorganic carbon via the reductive pentose phosphate cycle by using light energy. Moreover, in the absence of light, cyanobacteria utilize assimilated organic carbon, and some species of cyanobacterium are even capable of utilizing exogenous organic carbon. The cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 grows photoautotrophically under the light conditions and survives in the dark by catabolizing storage carbohydrates such as glycogen. Although the original isolate of this strain was not able to grow in the presence of glucose, a glucose-tolerant (GT) 1The abbreviations used are: GT, glucose-tolerant; LAHG, light-activated heterotrophic growth; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate; ORF, open reading frame. 1The abbreviations used are: GT, glucose-tolerant; LAHG, light-activated heterotrophic growth; G6PD, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; 6PGD, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; OPP, oxidative pentose phosphate; ORF, open reading frame. mutant was subsequently isolated (1Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar). In the presence of glucose, this GT strain can grow mixotrophically under the light conditions as well as heterotrophically in the dark if provided with a daily pulse of white light. The latter type of growth is referred to as light-activated heterotrophic growth (LAHG) (2Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Similar to other eubacteria, the genome of cyanobacteria encodes multiple σ factors for RNA polymerase. These factors recognize gene promoters and determine the specificity of transcription by RNA polymerase. In general, eubacterial σ factors are classified into three categories. Group 1 σ factors are unique to each strain and correspond to the essential principal σ factor. Group 2 σ factors show high sequence similarity to group 1 σ factors. They also exhibit overlapping promoter recognition specificity with group 1 σ factors but are nonessential for growth. Group 3 includes all other types of σ factors. The existence of multiple σ factors is thought to allow switching of gene expression patterns in response to changes in the environment or developmental stage (3Wösten M.M.S.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar).In comparison to other eubacteria, cyanobacteria have unusually large number of group 2 σ factors (4Goto-Seki A. Shirokane M. Masuda S. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Group 2 σ factors of cyanobacteria were first discovered in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942, Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, and Microcystis sp. (5Brahamsha B. Haselkorn R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7273-7282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tanaka K.

Bacteriol. 1993; 43: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Genome analyses of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and subsequent cyanobacterial genome projects revealed at least four group 2 σ factors in each strain (9Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar). A similar number of group 2 σ factors had only been found previously in Actinomycetes (10Tanaka K. Shiina T. Takahashi H. Science. 1988; 242: 1040-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, the genes for the group 2 σ factors SigB and SigC are induced by nitrogen or sulfur deprivation, suggesting that these factors play a role in adaptation to nutrient limitation (5Brahamsha B. Haselkorn R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7273-7282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002, the abundance of the sigB transcript is increased by either nitrogen or carbon depletion, whereas that of the sigC transcript initially increased and then declined under the same conditions (7Caslake L.F. Bryant D.A. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3807-3818Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Moreover, SigE of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was shown to be responsible for transcription of the dpsA gene, which encodes a nucleoid protein, during the stationary phase of growth (11Gruber T.M. Bryant D.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the case of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, SigH of Nostoc punctiforme is implicated in symbiosis with plant hosts (12Campbell E.L. Brahamsha B. Meeks J.C. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4938-4941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SigD, SigE, and SigF of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 contribute to cellular differentiation under diazotrophic growth conditions (13Kudyakov I.Y. Golden J.W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6667-6675Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Four group 2 σ factors, RpoD2, RpoD3, RpoD4, and SigC, of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 are important for circadian rhythmicity of transcription (14Tsinoremas N.F. Ishiura M. Kondo T. Andersson C.R. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Johnson C.H. Golden S.S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2488-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Nair U. Ditty J.L. Min H. Golden S.S. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3530-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).Four group 2 σ factors, SigB, SigC, SigD, and SigE, have been identified in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The expression patterns of sigB and sigD differ during the dark to light transition. Both sigB and sigD transcripts are also induced under various stress conditions (16Mikami K. Kanesaki Y. Suzuki I. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 17Tuominen I. Tyystjärvi E. Tyystjärvi T. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1116-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). SigC activates transcription of glnB, which encodes the carbon-nitrogen sensor PII, in the stationary phase (18Imamura S. Asayama M. Takahashi H. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Asayama M. Imamura S. Yoshihara S. Miyazaki A. Yoshida N. Sazuka T. Kaneko T. Ohara O. Tabata S. Osanai T. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2004; 68: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transcription of sigE increases by nitrogen depletion in a manner dependent on the global nitrogen regulator NtcA (20Muro-Pastor A.M. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1090-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Disruption of sigE results in a loss of viability under conditions of nitrogen deprivation as well as in a reduction in the expression of glnN (20Muro-Pastor A.M. Herrero A. Flores E. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 1090-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which encodes a type III glutamine synthetase. However, expression of most NtcA-dependent genes is not affected by the sigE mutation, and the relation between SigE and nitrogen regulation is still unclear. Moreover, the abundance of SigE is affected by the light to dark transition (16Mikami K. Kanesaki Y. Suzuki I. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 46: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), suggesting that this σ factor is important in these aspects of cell physiology that are unrelated to nitrogen availability.In the present study, we investigated the targets of the regulatory function of SigE in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and found that this σ factor plays an important role in the regulation of sugar catabolic pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—The GT strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (1Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (844) Google Scholar) and its derivatives were used in this study. Cells were grown in BG-11 medium containing 10 or 5 mm NH4Cl as a nitrogen source for plates and liquid culture, respectively. Medium was also supplemented with 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0). The cells were cultured under continuous white light (∼70 μmol photons m–2 s–1) at 30 °C in an atmosphere of 2% (v/v) CO2. Liquid cultures were aerated with the same gas mixture (21Rippka R. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The dark condition was achieved by wrapping culture vessels with aluminum foil. For LAHG, BG-11 plates further containing 5 mm glucose were incubated in the dark with a daily pulse of white light for 15 min. Cell growth and density were determined by measurement of OD750 with a spectrophotometer (Beckman model DU640). For the construction of a sigE mutant, the sigE (sll1689) coding region of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was isolated by digestion of M13 phage clone ps00320736 (CyanoBase positions 1,301,322–1,303,755) (22Kaneko T. Tanaka A. Sato S. Kotani H. Sazuka T. Mayajima N. Sugiura M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1995; 2: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) with PvuII and was cloned into the HincII site of pUC118 (Takara). The gene was interrupted at the unique BglII site by insertion of a BamHI kanamycin resistance cassette derived from pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting construct was used to transform the GT strain. Colonies resistant to kanamycin (5 μg/ml) were selected, and isolation of a single colony was repeated three times. The disruption of sigE was confirmed by PCR with specific primers (Table SI) and also by immunoblot analysis with specific antiserum. The hik8 mutant was as described previously (23Suzuki I. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar).Isolation of RNA and Microarray Analysis—Cells of mid-exponential phase cultures of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (OD750, 0.5–0.7) grown in BG-11-based medium were collected by centrifugation at 6,600 × g for 5 min. RNA was isolated from the cells by the previously described acid phenol-chloroform method (24Los D.A. Ray M.K. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 1167-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). DNA microarray analysis was performed with CyanoChip version 1.6, which contained PCR fragments of full length or each 1 kbp of the COOH-terminal part of the ORFs (Takara), as described previously (23Suzuki I. Kanesaki Y. Mikami K. Kanehisa M. Murata N. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Labeling of cDNA with Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences) was performed with an RNA fluorescence labeling core kit (Moloney murine leukemia virus version) version 2.0 (Takara). After hybridization, the microarray was rinsed with 0.2× SSC and then scanned with an array scanner (GMS418, Affymetrix) (18Imamura S. Asayama M. Takahashi H. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Shirai M. FEBS Lett. 2003; 554: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Signals were quantified and analyzed with ImaGene version 4.0 software (BioDiscovery) as described previously (25Kanesaki Y. Suzuki I. Allakhverdiev S.I. Mikami K. Murata N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Three biologically independent microarray experiments were performed, and similar results were obtained.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the same method as for microarray analysis, and Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (26Kanamaru K. Nagashima A. Fujiwara M. Shimada H. Shirano Y. Nakabayashi K. Shibata D. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 1034-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Gene-specific probes were constructed with specific primers (Table SI) and Synechocystis genomic DNA as template (27Kanamaru K. Fujiwara M. Kim M. Nagashima A. Nakazato E. Tanaka K. Takahashi H. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 1119-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Assay of Glucose Uptake—Cells were collected at mid-exponential phase by centrifugation at 17,400 × g for 1 min and were resuspended in BG-11 supplemented with 5 mm NH4Cl and 2 mm glucose to obtain an OD750 of 1.0. Glucose uptake was assayed by measurement of the concentration of glucose in the medium with a Glucose CII kit (Wako Pure Chemicals). Portions (100 μl) of the culture were harvested every 2 h and centrifuged at 17,400 × g for 1 min, followed by the determination of glucose concentration of the resulting supernatant.Analysis of G6PD and 6PGD Activities—Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD) activities were measured by monitoring the glucose 6-phosphate- or 6-phosphogluconate-dependent increase in NADPH concentration at A340 with a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. For assay of G6PD activity, cells were suspended in 1 ml of buffer A (55 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3.4 mm MgCl2) and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 17,400 × g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was used for the enzyme assay. The reaction was initiated at 25 °C in a mixture containing 45 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2.8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NADP+, and 10 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and the change in A340 was monitored for 1 min. As a control, the change in A340 in the absence of glucose 6-phosphate was measured and subtracted from the experimental values. The activity of 6PGD was measured according to the protocol provided by Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd. with some modifications.Determination of Glycogen Abundance—Assay of intracellular glycogen was performed as described previously (28Forchhammer K. Tandeau de Marsac N. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells (∼6 × 108) were suspended in 100 μl of 3.5% (v/v) sulfuric acid and boiled for 40 min. Glucose produced by acid hydrolysis was quantified with the use of o-toluidine according to the protocol recommended by Sigma.Production of Rabbit Antiserum to SigE and Immunoblot Analysis— The ORF of sigE was amplified by PCR with specific primers (Table SI) and cloned into pET21b (Novagen) with the use of the 5′ NdeI and 3′ XhoI sites included in the primers. After confirming the structure by sequencing, the resulting plasmid was used to transform Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and expression of the hexahistidine-tagged recombinant SigE protein was induced in cells cultivated at 37 °C in LB medium by exposure to 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Wako Pure Chemicals) for 2 h. Cells were harvested from 500-ml cultures by centrifugation (2,400 × g for 10 min), resuspended in 25 ml of sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl), and disrupted by sonication. The SigE protein was present in inclusion bodies and was collected by centrifugation of the crude extract at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The resulting pellet was washed once with 25 ml of sonication buffer containing 4% (v/v) Triton X-100, dissolved in 5 ml of denaturation buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, 0.01 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)), incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and centrifuged again at 10,000 × g for 15 min to remove debris. The recombinant protein was purified from the resulting supernatant by affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). After application of the sample and washing of the column with denaturation buffer, proteins were eluted with a solution containing 8 m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl and a pH gradient of 8.0 to 4.5. SigE was eluted at pH 4.5, and its abundance was quantified with a Bio-Rad protein assay. The purified protein (1 mg) was mixed with the same amount of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) and injected into a rabbit for the generation of polyclonal antibodies. Immunoblot analysis with the resulting antiserum was performed as described previously (29Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).RESULTSMicroarray Analysis for Identification of Potential SigE Targets—To provide insight into SigE function, we constructed a targeting vector by inserting a kanamycin resistance cassette into the BglII site of the gene, and we used the resulting construct to transform the wild-type (GT) strain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Fig. 1A). The disruption of endogenous sigE in the transformed strain, designated G50, was confirmed by PCR (Fig. 1B) and immunoblot analysis with antiserum specific for SigE (Fig. 1C). The growth of G50 under photoautotrophic or photomixotrophic conditions did not appear to differ from that of the wild type (data not shown).To compare the transcriptomes of GT and G50, we extracted total RNA from both strains cultured under the normal growth condition and processed it for microarray analysis with a gene chip including fragments of cyanobacterial ORF (Fig. 1D). Of the 3,076 genes represented on the array, the expression level of 67 genes was reduced over 2-fold by the sigE mutation (Table SII). The down-regulated genes included several genes whose products contribute to sugar catabolism, including enzymes that participate in glycolysis, the oxidative pentose phosphate (OPP) pathway, or glycogen breakdown (Table I). These results thus suggest that the expression of these genes is dependent on SigE.Table IGenes whose products contribute to sugar catabolism and whose expression was affected by the sigE mutationGene (G50/GT)ORFGene productExpression ratiopfkAsll1196Phosphofructokinase0.43 ± 0.23pfkAsll0745Phosphofructokinase0.90 ± 0.38gap1slr0884Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase0.64 ± 0.11gap2sll1342Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase1.20 ± 0.11pyk1sll0587Pyruvate kinase0.32aValues shown are means ± S.D. of data from four to six spots, with the exception of 0.32, which is the average of only two spots (four spots were under the threshold value for detection).pyk2sll1275Pyruvate kinase1.18 ± 0.09zwfslr1843Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase0.82 ± 0.11opcAslr1734Allosteric activator of G6PD0.28 ± 0.12gndsll03296-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase0.21 ± 0.03talslr1793Transaldolase0.15 ± 0.03glgXslr1857Glycogen isoamylase1.38 ± 0.28glgXslr0237Glycogen isoamylase0.65 ± 0.14glgPslr1367Glycogen phosphorylase1.07 ± 0.14glgPsll1356Glycogen phosphorylase0.75 ± 0.07a Values shown are means ± S.D. of data from four to six spots, with the exception of 0.32, which is the average of only two spots (four spots were under the threshold value for detection). Open table in a new tab Positive Regulation of Glycolysis by SigE—The genes whose expression was reduced by the sigE mutation and whose products contribute to glycolysis included those for phosphofructokinase (pfkA (sll1196)), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap1), and pyruvate kinase (pyk1) (Table I). Northern hybridization confirmed that the abundance of transcripts of these three genes was reduced in G50 cells under the normal growth condition (Fig. 2A). The genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains two structural genes for each of these enzymes. Phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase catalyze irreversible reactions in glycolysis. Induction of the expression of either of the two structural genes for each of these enzymes would be expected to increase glycolytic flux. Of the two genes for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, gap1 encodes an NAD+-dependent enzyme that has been shown to be responsible for the glycolytic reaction (30Koksharova O. Schubert M. Shestakov S. Cerff R. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Induction of transcription of pfkA (sll1196), gap1, and pyk1 by SigE thus likely increases the rate of glycolysis in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.Fig. 2Down-regulation of the expression of glycolytic and OPP pathway enzymes in G50 cells. A and B, Northern blot analysis of transcripts derived from genes that contribute to glycolysis (pfkA (sll1196), gap1, and pyk1) or to the OPP pathway (zwf, opcA, gnd, and tal), respectively. GT or G50 cells were grown under the normal growth condition, and RNA was isolated either before or 1 or 4 h after a shift from light (L) to dark. Total RNA (10 μg) was then subjected to Northern analysis with probes specific for the indicated genes. The positions of molecular size markers (in kilobases) are indicated. The lower panels show rRNA stained with methylene blue as a loading control. C and D, enzyme activities of G6PD and 6PGD, respectively. Cells treated as described above were assayed for the activities of G6PD and 6PGD. Data are expressed relative to the value for GT cells under the normal growth condition and are means ± S.D. of values from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given that sugar catabolism is especially important in the absence of light, we also examined the effects of a shift from light to dark on the amounts of the transcripts of these three genes. Northern blot analysis revealed that, for GT cells, the abundance of pyk1 transcripts was increased slightly, whereas that of pfkA (sll1196) and gap1 transcripts remained unchanged 1 h after the dark shift. However, the amount of pyk1 transcripts was decreased slightly and that of pfkA (sll1196) and gap1 transcripts was reduced markedly after 4 h (Fig. 2A). Consistent with a role for SigE in regulation of the expression of these genes, in G50, although a slight induction of pyk1 expression was observed after the dark shift, the transcript levels of all three genes remained reduced compared with those in the wild type (Fig. 2A).Positive Regulation of the OPP Pathway by SigE—Microarray analysis suggested that transcription of OPP pathway genes was reduced by the sigE mutation (Table I). Northern blot analysis confirmed that under the normal growth condition and after the dark shift the abundance of transcripts derived from gnd (which encodes 6PGD, a key enzyme of the OPP pathway) and derived from tal (which encodes transaldolase, another enzyme of the OPP pathway) was greatly reduced in G50 cells compared with GT cells (Fig. 2B). The amounts of transcripts derived from zwf (which encodes G6PD, another key enzyme of the OPP pathway) and from opcA (which encodes a protein that is conserved only among cyanobacteria and is required for oligomerization of G6PD) were also reduced by the sigE mutation under both light and dark conditions (Fig. 2B). Consistent with these differences in transcript levels, the activities of both G6PD and 6PGD were decreased by the sigE mutation under the normal growth condition and after the dark shift (Fig. 2, C and D). In GT cells, the enhancement in the activities of these enzymes 4 h after dark shift was also reduced (G6PD) or actually reversed by the sigE mutation (Fig. 2, C and D). These results thus indicate that metabolic flux through the OPP pathway is down-regulated in G50 cells.Reduced Rate of Glucose Uptake in the sigE Mutant—Current observations indicate that glycolysis and the OPP pathway are positively regulated by SigE, suggesting that the rate of glucose catabolism might be reduced by the sigE mutation. To examine this possibility, we cultured GT and G50 in medium supplemented with glucose, and we measured the rate of glucose uptake by the cells. As predicted, in comparison to wild type, the rate of glucose uptake in G50 cells was reduced (∼20–30%) (Fig. 3), suggesting that the rate of glucose catabolism is indeed reduced by the sigE mutation.Fig. 3Reduced rate of glucose uptake in G50 cells. GT or G50 cells in mid-logarithmic phase were suspended in BG-11 supplemented with 10 mm NH4Cl and 2 mm glucose, and the decrease in the glucose concentration of the medium was determined at the indicated times thereafter. Data are means ± S.D. of values from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Positive Regulation of Glycogen Catabolism by SigE—Microarray analysis suggested that the abundance of transcripts derived from the genes for glycogen isoamylase (glgX (slr0237)) and glycogen phosphorylase (glgP (sll1356)) was reduced by the sigE mutation (Table I). In eubacteria, most glycogen is degraded through the action of glycogen phosphorylase. However glycogen isoamylase is also required for the complete digestion of glycogen (31Ball S.G. Morell M.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). The genome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 contains two glgX and two glgP genes, and we examined the abundance of the transcripts of all four genes by Northern analysis. Consistent with the microarray data, the amounts of glgX (slr0237) and glgP (sll1356) transcripts were reduced in G50 cells under the normal growth condition (Fig. 4A). The sigE deficiency did not markedly affect the levels of glgX (slr1857) and glgP (slr1367) transcripts under the normal growth condition. However, the amount of glgP (slr1367) transcripts in the dark condition was reduced in G50 compared with that in GT cells (Fig. 4A). We further examined whether these effects of the sigE mutation resulted in a difference in the extent of glycogen accumulation between GT and G50 cells. Under the normal growth condition, the amount of glycogen in G50 was greater than that in GT cells (Fig. 4B). Transfer of both strains to the dark resulted in reduction in the amount of glycogen. However, the rate of glycogen utilization was reduced by ∼10–20% in the sigE mutant (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that glycogen catabolism was reduced by the sigE mutation.Fig. 4Down-regulation of the expression of glycogen catabolic enzymes in G50 cells. A, Northern blot analysis of transcripts derived from glycogen catabolic genes. GT or G50 cells were grown under the normal growth condition, and RNA was isolated either before or 1 or 4 h after a dark shift. Total RNA (10 μg) was subjected to Northern analysis with probes specific for the indicated genes. The positions of molecular size standards (in kilobases) are indicated. L, light. B, analysis of intracellular glycogen abundance. The amount of glycogen in cells under the normal growth condition or 1, 4, or 6 h after a dark shift was determined.

https://openalex.org/W2053332435,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma express high levels of the EF-hand calcium-binding protein S100A2 in contrast to other tumorigenic tissues and cell lines where the expression of this protein is reduced. Subtractive hybridization of tumorigenic versus normal tumor-derived mammary epithelial cells has previously identified the S100A2 protein as potential tumor suppressor. The biological function of S100A2 in carcinogenesis, however, has not been elucidated to date. Here, we report for the first time that during recovery from hydroxyurea treatment, the S100A2 protein translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and co-localized with the tumor suppressor p53 in two different oral carcinoma cells (FADU and SCC-25). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that the interaction between S100A2 and p53 is Ca2+-dependent. Preliminary characterization of this interaction indicated that the region in p53 involved with binding to S100A2 is located at the C terminus of p53. Finally, luciferase-coupled transactivation assays, where a p53-reporter construct was used, indicated that interaction with S100A2 increased p53 transcriptional activity. Our data suggest that in oral cancer cells the Ca2+- and cell cycle-dependent p53-S100A2 interaction might modulate proliferation.

Our data suggest that in oral cancer cells the Ca2+- and cell cycle-dependent p53-S100A2 interaction might modulate proliferation. S100A2 is a member of the subfamily of S100 Ca2+-binding proteins, characterized by two distinct EF-hand structural motifs. It is a homodimeric protein that upon binding of calcium undergoes a conformational change (1Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct.

The transduction of calcium signals in that form regulates many cellular functions such as the control of cell growth and proliferation (3Taylor D.A. Bowman B.F. Stull J.T. J. Biol.

The S100A2 protein has been first detected in lung and kidney and is mainly expressed in a subset of tissues and cells such as breast epithelia and liver (6Heizmann C. Fritz G. Schafer B. Front.

S100A2 and twenty other S100 genes are located on a cluster on human chromosome 1q21, a region frequently rearranged in human cancer (6Heizmann C. Fritz G. Schafer B. Front.

Interestingly the cDNA coding for the S100A2 protein was identified as a novel tumor suppressor gene by subtractive hybridization between normal and tumor-derived human mammary epithelial cells (12Lee S. Tomasetto C. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2825-2829Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Expression studies showed that the S100A2 gene is markedly down-regulated in several tumor tissues of various origins like melanomas (13Maelandsmo G. Florenes V. Mellingsaeter T. Hovig E. Kerbel R. Fodstad O. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and breast carcinoma (14Pedrocchi M. Schafer B. Mueller H. Eppenberger U. Heizmann C. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, growth factors were reported to alter the S100A2 gene expression at late G1/S-phase, indicating that S100A2 is cell cycle-regulated (15Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Swisshelm K. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2504-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Site-specific DNA methylation of the S100A2 gene promoter region in normal versus tumorigenic breast cancer cell lines indicated repression of gene expression in tumor cells, thus suggesting a role for S100A2 in suppression of tumor cell growth and possibly inhibition of tumor progression (16Wicki R. Franz C. Scholl F. Heizmann C. Schafer B. Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Recently, much attention has been paid to the expression of the S100A2 gene and gene product in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). 1The abbreviations used are: HNSCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; FADU/SCC-25, oral epithelial carcinoma cells; HBL100, human breast epithelia cell line; HU, hydroxyurea; IP, immunoprecipitation; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IVT, in vitro translated; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting.

However, although interactions between p53 and S100 proteins are of particular interest, the mechanism of S100-p53-regulated growth arrest, and in particular the role of S100A2 in carcinogenesis in HNSCC, has not been elucidated to date. In an attempt to study the biological role of S100A2, we investigated the subcellular localization of S100A2 and p53 proteins in HNSCC cell lines synchronized with the DNA-replication inhibitor hydroxyurea (34Timson J. Mutat. Res. 1975; 32: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Next, we examined the calcium dependence of S100A2-p53 association in vivo using two distinct HNSCC lines as well as cells derived from breast cancer epithelia. The interaction between the two proteins was confirmed through in vitro pull-down assay using full-length and truncated p53 proteins. Moreover, the effect of this interaction on p53 transactivation was examined in a luciferase-coupled reporter assay. Our data provide the first insights into the regulation of p53 activity by S100A2. DNA Constructs—Full-length cDNA of human p531-393 and the deletion construct p5373-393, both containing a Kozak consensus start, were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) by PCR employing a 5′ BamHI site and a 3′ NotI site. p21-luc (in pGL2), p53Asp281→Gly, and p531-362 (lacking the S100B binding site) were gifts from Patrick Chène, Novartis, Basel and have been described previously (35Atema A.

Cancer. 1999; 82: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The full-length S100A2 cDNA was cloned as a fusion into pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Biosciences) by PCR using a 5′ BamHI site and 3′ EcoRI site. All constructs were controlled by sequencing. Human Squamous Cell Carcinoma Tissues Biopsies—Human HNSCC tissue sections originating from patients suffering from hypopharynx and tongue carcinoma were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The sections were stained using the following antibodies: monoclonal mouse anti-human p53-DO-1 (p53-DO-1, Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), monoclonal mouse anti-human p53-1801 (p53-1801; Santa Cruz, Biotechnology), polyclonal human anti-rabbit S100A2 (anti-S100A2), polyclonal human anti-rabbit S100A4 (anti-S100A4), and polyclonal human anti-rabbit S100A6 (anti-S100A6, all from Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), at a dilution of 1:25. Human tissue samples were analyzed using a wide field microscope (Leica, Switzerland), at a resolution of ×20. Human HNSCC-Cell Lines—FADU (originating from the hypopharynx, HTB-43, ATCC, Manassas, VA) and SCC-25 cells (from a tongue, ATCC CCL-1628, kindly provided by Dr. C. Decaestecker, Institute de Pharmacy, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelles), normal breast epithelial cell line HBL-100 (HCC1187, ATCC), and H1299 lung adenocarcinoma cells (CRL-5803, ATCC) were all grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 IU/ml streptomycin (complete medium). Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method. Cell Synchronization Assay and Cell Cycle Analysis—Exponentially growing FADU, SCC-25, and HBL100 cells were treated with 2 mm HU (Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) for 24, 28, and 20 h, respectively, to obtain G1/S-phase arrest. Synchronized cells were released from the HU block and subjected to cell cycle analysis. For FACS analysis, samples were collected at the indicated time points, trypsinized, washed, and stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml) according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Cycle Test™Plus DNA Reagent Kit, BD Biosciences). Stained samples were analyzed in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences), and cell cycle distribution was analyzed with WinMDI software. Immunofluorescence—FADU and SCC-25 cells were grown on glass coverslips and synchronized with HU. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized using 0.1% Triton for 1 min, and blocked in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-horse serum (1%) for 1 h at room temperature after extensive washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Slides were incubated with the following antibodies: monoclonal anti-p53-DO1 at a dilution of 1:100 and polyclonal anti-S100A2 at a dilution of 1:500 for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with the secondary CY2- and CY5-conjugated anti-mouse and the CY3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) both at a dilution of 1:200 as described previously (37Ilg E.C. Troxler H. Burgisser D.M. Kuster T. Markert M. Guignard F. Hunziker P. Birchler N. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Nuclear stainings were performed using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Control stainings were performed on untreated cells and with the secondary antibody alone. Localization of the proteins was obtained with a Leica confocal microscope (DMIRE, Wetzlar, Germany). Western Blot—For whole cell extracts, cells were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1% Triton, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm NaCl), and samples were clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge. 100 μg of protein extracts were resuspended in loading buffer, heated for 5 min at 95 °C and loaded onto a 4-12%-gradient SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen). Upon separation of proteins under denaturing conditions, proteins were transferred to Nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel, Germany) and probed with the following antibodies: polyclonal anti-S100A2 at 1:2000 dilution, monoclonal anti-p53-DO1 antibodies at 1:5000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature in TBST/3% milk powder. Membranes were washed in TBST, incubated with the secondary anti-rabbit- or the anti-mouse-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:10000), respectively, for 1 h at room temperature, and exposed to ECL detection reagent (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were visualized on Kodak films. Co-immunoprecipitation—FADU and HBL100 cell extracts were prepared as described above and precleared with Protein G- and Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Monoclonal anti-p53-DO-1 and polyclonal anti-S100A2 antibodies were coupled to Protein-G- and Protein-A-Sepharose beads, respectively, and washed with NET-80 buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm ETDA) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were again washed with NET-80 buffer and precleared cell extracts were incubated for 6 h at 4°C in the presence of 0.1-2 mm CaCl2. Pellets were centrifuged at 11,000 rpm, rinsed once with NET-80 buffer, and three times with buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.2% Triton, 500 mm NaCl), buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS), and buffer C (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton). Western blotting was carried out as described above. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—An oligonucleotide derived from the p21/WAF promoter (33Grigorian M. Andresen S. Tulchinsky E. Kriajevska M.

Human p53 proteins in nuclear extracts were obtained from H1299 cells after transient transfection using the calcium phosphate method. Human recombinant S100A2 protein was purified as previously described (8Franz C. Durussel I. Cox J. Schafer B. Heizmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18826-18834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were incubated in the presence of 5× gel shift binding buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)) and 0.5 and 1 μg of recombinant S100A2 protein. For the S100A2 interaction with p53, the reaction mix was incubated in the presence of 2 mm calcium or 5 mm EDTA for 1-2 h at 4 °C. Radiolabeled oligonucleotide p21/WAF was added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The assay was terminated with 1 μl of gel loading 10× buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 40% glycerol). Samples were run on 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel (CleanGel™ System 25S, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C overnight. GST-Pull-down Assay—The GST-S100A2 fusion construct was expressed from pGEX-3X and purified as previously described (38Fikrig E. Barthold S.W. Kantor F.S. Flavell R.A. Science. 1990; 250: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). p53 full-length and deletion mutants were cloned in pcDNA3 plasmid (Invitrogen) and used to produce 35S-labeled proteins (Amersham Biosciences) with the TnT-coupled transcription-translation system (IVT, Promega, Madison, WI): 2 μg of GST-S100A2 coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads washed with 2 mm CaCl2 were incubated with 4 μl of the IVT reaction mix and NET-80 buffer (80 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris) for 3 h at 4 °C. Radiolabeled proteins were pulled down, washed extensively with NET-80 buffer, and separated on a 4-12% SDS-Gel NuPAGE (Invitrogen). The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C to visualize radiolabeled proteins. Transcriptional Activation Assay—A luciferase construct driven under the control of the p21 promoter (p21-luc) was used to study the transcriptional activity of p53. H1299 cells (6 × 105) were plated in 60-mm dishes in the presence of complete medium and transfected after 24 h using the calcium phosphate method. The following constructs were used: p531-393, p5373-393, and p531-362 (lacking the S100B-p53 binding site) and S100A2. After 48 h of transfection, luciferase activity was measured according to the manufacturer's guidelines (Promega). Transfection efficiency was normalized using β-galactosidase activity. Results are the mean of three independent experiments. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Student t test. p53 and S100 Proteins Are Differentially Localized in Human HNSCC Tissue Biopsies—S100 and p53 display a characteristic nuclear and cytoplasmic staining in tumor biopsy sections (Fig. 1) originating from the tongue (upper panel) and the hypopharynx (lower panel). Wild-type p53 predominantly accumulated in the nucleus in both tissue sections but was found in the cytoplasm of sections of the tongue (upper panel, a). S100A2 was expressed in the cytoplasm and diffusely in the nucleus in sections of the tongue (upper panel, c) as well as the hypopharynx (lower panel, c). Compared with S100A2, S100A4 (upper and lower panels, d) and S100A6 (upper and lower panels, e) were both exclusively expressed in the cytoplasm of HNSCC tissue biopsies. The staining for the S100B protein was negative (upper and lower panels, f). To further investigate the evidence on the cytosolic localization of S100A2 and p53, which are normally nuclear proteins (14Pedrocchi M. Schafer B. Mueller H. Eppenberger U. Heizmann C. Int. J.

Cell Cycle-dependent Localization of S100A2 in Human FADU and SCC-25 Cells—To assess whether transition through the cell cycle affects S100A2 subcellular localization, FADU and SCC-25 cells expressing both endogenous S100A2 and p53 proteins were treated with HU. HU blocks ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase and leads to rapid depletion of deoxyribonucleotide pool, thereby arresting the cells at the G1/S boundary. Immunofluorescence staining of untreated FADU cells showed that p53 and S100A2 were predominantly localized in the nucleus, whereas cytoplasmic staining for both proteins was evident in SCC-25 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). The merged images indicated partial co-localization of p53 and S100A2 in the nucleus in FADU but mainly cytoplasmic co-localization in SCC-25 cells. Treatment of FADU or SCC-25 with 2 mm HU for 24 or 28 h, respectively, resulted in synchronization at G1/S as shown by flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). Under these conditions, p53 and S100A2 co-localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in both cell lines (Fig. 2, t = 0, panels C and D). Upon HU removal (t = 1), cells synchronously moved into S-phase (Fig. 3, A and B), and this was characterized by translocation of p53 to the nucleus in FADU and SCC-25 cells. At this time point, S100A2 translocated to the nucleus in both cell lines (Fig. 2, C and D). At 8 and 10 h, respectively, after release from the HU block (t = 2), cells were mostly in G2 phase (Fig. 3, A and B), and both p53 and S100A2 proteins were exclusively present in the nucleus. During transition through the next cell cycle, at 12 and 16 h after release from the HU block (t = 3), p53 and S100A2 were redistributed to the cytoplasm where they co-localized. Finally, in FADU cells, 24 h after release from the HU block (t = 4), p53 and S100A2 staining returned to the pattern displayed in untreated cells.Fig. 3Cell cycle analysis of FADU and SCC-25 cells synchronized with HU. FADU (A), SCC-25 (B), and HBL100 cells (C) synchronized with HU (2 mm) for 24, 28, and 20 h, respectively, were released at the indicated times in complete medium and stained with propidium iodide prior to flow cytometric analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) FACS analysis of FADU and SCC-25 cells indicated that the less differentiated SSC-25 cells had a longer cell cycle as compared with the former (Fig. 3, A and B). Taken together these data show cell cycle-dependent shuttling of p53 and S100A2 in FADU and SSC-25 cells with co-localization in the nucleus at late S/G2-phase. Endogenous S100A2 and p53 Interact in FADU and HBL100 Cells in a Calcium-dependent Manner—Co-localization of p53 suggested that the two proteins may physically interact. To substantiate this finding, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments using total extracts of FADU cells. Precleared FADU cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p53-DO-1 antibody in the presence of increasing calcium concentrations or 5 mm EDTA. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot analysis with anti-S100A2 (Fig. 4A). The results showed that S100A2 co-immunoprecipitated with p53 in the presence of calcium concentrations higher than 0.1 mm (lanes 3-5). In contrast, no interaction between p53 and S100A2 could be detected in the presence of a calcium chelator (lane 7) or at low calcium concentration (lane 2). Identical results were obtained when immunoprecipitations (IP) were performed with S100A2 antibody and p53 was detected with p53-DO-1 antibody (Fig. 4B). To rule out the possibility that the signal given by the IgG-heavy chain of the antibody used in IP could be erroneously interpreted as p53, we performed control-IP using anti-S100A2 antibody in the absence of cell extract. The results indicated that no protein band at the level of ∼50 kDa could be detected when using antibody p53-DO-1 for Western blotting (Fig. 4, B and D, lane 1). Western blotting of S100A2 confirmed the efficiency of the antibody used for IP (Fig. 4, C and E). To support the evidence obtained from FADU cells, we employed HBL100 cells that originate from breast cancer tissue and, like FADU cells, express wild-type p53 and S100A2 (Fig. 4D). As shown in Fig. 3C, HBL100 cells could also be synchronized with HU. Precleared HBL100 cell lysates were incubated with anti-S100A2 antibody under the same conditions used for FADU cells. Also in the case of HBL100 cells, the interaction between p53 and S100A2 was readily observable though at slightly higher calcium concentrations (lane 5) than in FADU cells. As observed in the latter, addition of 5 mm EDTA during IP completely abrogated this interaction (lane 7). Taken together, these findings suggest that the interaction between p53 and S100A2 is Ca2+-dependent and occurs in cell lines expressing the two proteins, independent of the tumor type from which the cells originate. S100A2 Binding to p53 Affects Its DNA Binding Activity—To characterize the physiological consequences of S100A2 binding to p53, we examined p53 DNA binding activity (Fig. 5). To this end, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift using nuclear extracts from H1299 cells and a labeled oligonucleotide containing the p53-consensus sequence of the p21 promoter. Because H1299 cells lack both p53 and S100A2, they were transiently transfected with the p531-393 construct (lane 1). Addition of 0.5 μg of recombinant S100A2 protein to H1299 nuclear extracts resulted in supershift of the oligonucleotide-p53 complex in the presence (lane 4) but not in the absence of 2 mm calcium (lane 3). Addition of 5 mm EDTA to the p53-S100A2 complex completely reversed the effect of calcium (lane 5). Furthermore, we tested DNA binding in the presence of increasing amounts of S100A2. Previous reports have shown that increasing amounts of S100B reduce the intensity of p53 complex binding to its responsive element (30Baudier J. Delphin C. Grunwald D. Khochbin S. Lawrence J.J. Proc.

Similarly, in the presence of 1 μg of S100A2 and 2 mm calcium, the intensity of the S100A2-p53 complex was clearly reduced (lane 7). Again, calcium was essential for the induction of the supershift, and the latter could be reversed by 5 mm EDTA (lane 8). Ectopic expression of p53 proteins in transiently transfected H1299 cells was controlled by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5B). These results show that the"

Activation-induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) initiates switch recombination and somatic hypermutation in B cells by targeted deamination of transcribed genes. We show that transcription of the immunoglobulin S regions and c-MYC results in formation of similar DNA structures, 'G-loops', which contain a cotranscriptional RNA: DNA hybrid on the C-rich strand and single-stranded regions and G4 DNA on the G-rich strand. AID binds specifically to G-loops within transcribed S regions and c-MYC, and G-loops in c-MYC map to the regions associated with translocation breakpoints and aberrant hypermutation in B-cell lymphomas. Aberrant targeting of AID to DNA structures formed upon c-MYC transcription may therefore contribute to the genetic instability of c-MYC in B-cell malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2130663435,"Common variants of APOA5 have consistently shown association with differences in plasma triglyceride (TG) levels. These single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fall into three common haplotypes: APOA5*1, with common alleles at all sites; APOA5*2, with rare alleles of –1131T→ C, –3A→ G, 751G→ T, and 1891T→ C; and APOA5*3, distinguished by the c56C→ G (S19W). Molecular modeling of the apoAV signal peptide (SP) showed an increased angle of insertion (65°) at the lipid/water interface of Trp-19 SP compared with Ser-19 SP (40°), predicting reduced translocation. This was confirmed by 50% reduction of Trp-19-encoded SP·secretory alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) fusion protein secreted into the medium from HepG2 cells compared with the Ser-19·SEAP fusion protein (p < 0.002). Considering APOA5*2 SNPs, there was no significant difference in the relative luciferase expression in Huh7 cells transiently transfected with a –1131T construct compared with the –1131C (fragments –1177 to –516 or –1177 to –3). Similarly, for the –3A→ G in the Kozak sequence, in vitro transcription/translation assays and primer extension inhibition assays showed no alternate AUG initiation codon usage, demonstrating that –3A→ G did not influence translation efficiency. Although 1891T→ C in the 3′-untranslated region disrupts a putative Oct-1 transcription factor binding site, when inserted 3′ of the luciferase gene the T→ C change demonstrated no significant difference in luciferase expression. Thus, association of APOA5*2 SNPs with TG levels is not due to the individual effects of any of these SNPs, although cooperativity between the SNPs cannot be excluded. Alternatively, the effect on TG levels may reflect the strong linkage disequilibrium with the functional APOC3 SNPs. Common variants of APOA5 have consistently shown association with differences in plasma triglyceride (TG) levels.

There is strong evidence from clinical studies, epidemiological studies, and animal models (reviewed in Ref. 1.van Dijk K.W. Rensen P.C. Voshol P.J. Havekes L.M. Curr. Opin.

Transgenic and knock-out mouse models identified an inverse relationship between apoAV and plasma TG levels (2.Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C. Cox D.R. Fruchart J.C. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Science. 2001; 294: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). APOA5 variants determine between individual differences in plasma TG in all ethnic groups studied to date (3.Talmud P.J. Hawe E. Martin S. Olivier M. Miller G.J. Rubin E.M. Pennacchio L.A.

Genet. 2002; 11: 3031-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of apoAV in TG metabolism is further supported by the recently identified rare mutation Q145X, introducing a premature termination of apoAV and resulting in apoAV deficiency and severe hypertriglyceridemia (5.Oliva C.P. Pisciotta L. Li V.G. Sambataro M.P. Cantafora A. Bellocchio A. Catapano A. Tarugi P. Bertolini S. Calandra S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 25: 411-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However the exact function(s) of apoAV remain to be clarified. APOA5 expression is up-regulated in liver regeneration after rat hepatectomy (6.van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G. Leegwater A.C. Levels J.H. Reitsma P.H. Boers W. Chamuleau R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44512-44520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), suggesting that it acts as a break on very low density lipoprotein assembly (7.Weinberg R.B.

ApoAV is found preferentially on high density lipoprotein but is thought to transfer to very low density lipoprotein in the postprandial state (8.Fruchart-Najib J. Bauge E. Niculescu L.S. Pham T. Thomas B. Rommens C. Majd Z. Brewer B. Pennacchio L.A. Fruchart J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 319: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and has been shown to activate lipoprotein lipase in vitro and in vivo (9.Schaap F.G. Rensen P.C. Voshol P.J. Vrins C. van der Vliet H.N. Chamuleau R.A. Havekes L.M. Groen A.K. van Dijk K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27941-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The APOA5 gene itself is relatively polymorphic. The five most common APOA5 haplotypes can be defined by seven SNPs (10.Olivier M. Wang X. Cole R. Gau B. Kim J. Rubin E.M. Pennacchio L.A. Genomics. 2004; 83: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Two haplotypes, APOA5*2 and APOA5*3, are of particular interest as they show association with raised plasma TG levels (4.Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Cohen J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3031-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). APOA5*1 is the wild type haplotype defined by the common alleles at the seven sites. This is found at a frequency of 69% in Caucasian populations (10.Olivier M. Wang X. Cole R. Gau B. Kim J. Rubin E.M. Pennacchio L.A. Genomics. 2004; 83: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Haplotype APOA5*2 is defined by the rare alleles at four sites (10.Olivier M. Wang X. Cole R. Gau B. Kim J. Rubin E.M. Pennacchio L.A. Genomics. 2004; 83: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), –1131T→ C (SNP3 (2)), –3A→ G, 715G→ T (SNP 2, previously referred to as IVS3 + 476G→ T (2)), and 1891T→ C (SNP 1, previously referred to as c1259T→ C (2)) in the 3′-UTR of the gene. The third haplo-type, APOA5*3, is distinguished from APOA5*1 by the rare allele of the cSNP 56C→ G, which results in the substitution of Trp for Ser at residue 19 (S19W; SNP5 (2)). Haplotypes APOA5*2 and APOA5*3 occur at frequencies of 4% in a Caucasian study (11.Eichenbaum-Voline S. Olivier M. Jones E.L. Naoumova R.P. Jones B. Gau B. Patel H.N. Seed M. Betteridge D.J. Galton D.J. Rubin E.M. Scott J. Shoulders C.C. Pennacchio L.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2004; 24: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The rare alleles of 1764C→ T and V153M, the two remaining SNPs, both on chromosomes defined by the other common alleles, represent the other two APOA5 haplo-types. Family studies suggest that V153M is nonfunctional because it shows no co-segregation with hypertriglyceridemia in a carrier family (4.Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J. Krauss R.M. Rubin E.M. Cohen J.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3031-3038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas there is no information about the association of 1764C→ T with plasma lipids. We have therefore concentrated our functional studies on SNPs that define haplotypes APOA5*2 and -*3. The proximity of the APOA5 to APOA4/APOC3/APOA1 in the same gene cluster on chromosome 11q23 raised the question of whether the TG-raising effects of APOA5 SNPs simply reflected linkage disequilibrium (LD) with functional variants in the other TG-raising gene, APOC3, or whether these were independent functional effects (3.Talmud P.J. Hawe E. Martin S. Olivier M. Miller G.J. Rubin E.M. Pennacchio L.A. Humphries S.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3039-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Haplotype analysis of the APOA5/A4/C3 gene cluster identified that whereas the S19W showed association with plasma TG levels, independent of APOC3, the –1131T→ C is in strong LD with the APOC3 –482C→ T, and thus associations of haplotype APOA5*2 may indeed be due to the effects of –482C→ T, which disrupts the normal insulin responsiveness of apoCIII. No detailed functional studies have been reported on these two TG-raising APOA5 haplotypes, and thus the purpose of this study was to investigate the basis for their effects and to determine which of these variant sites are functional. The Ser-19 (wild type) and variant Trp-19 23-amino acid signal peptides (SP) of apoAV were three-dimensionally constructed as α-helices using Hyperchem 5.0 (Hypercube, Inc.). Their conformations were minimized by the Polak-Ribiere algorithm in an AMBER force field. The two peptides were analyzed by the IMPALA algorithm, described elsewhere (12.Ducarme P. Rahman M. Brasseur R. Proteins. 1998; 30: 357-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This enables analysis of the insertion of a peptide in a modeled membrane using simple restraint functions designed to mimic the membrane properties. The position of the peptide in the modeled membrane is minimized by a Monte Carlo procedure. To test the effect of the apoAV signal peptide variant S19W, APOA5 signal peptide sequences with either a C or G at position 56 were used to replace the endogenous signal peptide sequence of the secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) in the Great EscAPe SEAP Reporter System 3 vector (BD Biosciences) by PCR concatenation following the method of Tuohy and Groden (13.Tuohy T.M. Groden J. Hum. Mutat. 1998; 12: 122-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The forward primer consisted of a SEAP sequence 5′ to its signal peptide followed by the APOA5 signal peptide sequence: internal forward (IntF) 5′-ATCGCCCACCATGCAGATAATGGCAAGCATGGCTGCCGTGCTCACCTGGGCTCTGGCTCTTGTTTCAGCG-3′. The reverse primer contained an overlap with a post-signal peptide SEAP sequence and the 3′ end of the APOA5 signal sequence: internal reverse (IntR) 5′-GCAACTGGGATGATTGCCTGGGTGGCCGAAAACGCTGAAAGAACAGCCAGAGCCA-3′ (the base 28 from the end of the primer (underlined) was either a G or C depending on whether the wild type (Ser-19) or variant (Trp-19) product was being amplified). External primers external forward (ExtF) ATCGCGAATTCGCCCACCATGC and external reverse (ExtR) 5′-CTCAAGCCAATGGTCTGGAAGTTCG-′ with EcoRI and BstXI sites (underlined), respectively, overlapped the IntF oligo and a naturally occurring BstXI site in the SEAP vector to allow generation of a 337-bp PCR product. Equal amounts (100 ng) of SEAP control vector and the APOA5/pGEM7 plasmid were mixed and concatenated by PCR in a 100-μl reaction mix containing 1× cloned Pfu buffer (Stratagene), 25 pmol of each primer, IntF, IntR, ExtF, and ExtR, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 5 units of Pfu Taq polymerase (Stratagene). The cycling conditions were 94 °C for 2 min, five cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 45 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 48 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 5 min to produce a PCR product size of 337 bp. The SEAP control vector was prepared by excising the EcoRI/BstXI fragment prior to subcloning the similarly digested APOA5 PCR product into its place. The final PCR products were checked by sequencing using a Big Dye terminator kit (Applera) and an ABI 377 automated sequencer. HepG2 cells were maintained in RPMI + l-glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. SEAP was assayed after transfection of the various constructs into HepG2 cells in OptiMEM (Invitrogen), using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer's protocol for the 96-well format. The Basic SEAP (lacking promoter and enhancer sequences) and the unmodified Control SEAP vector (with promoter and enhancer) acted as negative and positive controls, respectively. Co-transfection with β-galactosidase acted as a control for transfection normalization. The medium from the transfected cells was collected after a 48-h incubation. The cells were fixed and stained for β-galactosidase, and secreted alkaline phosphatase was detected using 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate as substrate according to the Great EscAPe SEAP Reporter System 3 protocol (BD Biosciences). The excitation and emission peaks of 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate fluorescence, 360 nm and 449 nm, respectively, were measured on a Tropix TR717 microplate luminometer (Applied Biosystems) to estimate quantitatively the amount of fusion protein secreted from the cells. Five repeat transfections were carried out, and each sample was replicated five times. To test the function of the –1131T→ C promoter variant, four different fragments were amplified by PCR from the DNA of individuals with known –1131T→ C and –3G→ A genotype. Two short fragments, which included only the –1131 site and were referred to as –1131T and –1131C, ranged from position –1177 to –512 using the original numbering of Olivier et al. (10.Olivier M. Wang X. Cole R. Gau B. Kim J. Rubin E.M. Pennacchio L.A. Genomics. 2004; 83: 912-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). A second set of longer fragments, which incorporated both the –1131 and –3 sites with the naturally occurring combinations and referred to as –1131T/–3A and –1131C/–3G, ranged from position –1177 to –3. Oligonucleotides were designed with KpnI sites at their 5′ end of the forward oligo and BglII at the 5′ end of the reverse oligo. In addition CGG and GA tails were introduced at 5′ ends of forward and reverse oligos. Oligonucleotides for the short fragments were as follows: forward primer, 5′-CGGGGTACCAGAGGCCCTGCGAGTGGAGTT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GAAGATCTTGCTCACCTGCTCACGTCT GG-3′. For the long fragment the same forward oligonucleotide was used. For the reverse primers the oligonucleotides were: reverse primer –1131T/–3A, 5′-GAAGATCTTCTGCTCTGAGAAGACAG GTGG-3′; reverse primer –1131C/–3G, 5′-GAAGATCTCCTGCTCTGAGAAGACAG GTGG-3′. PCR products were TA-cloned into pGEM-T vector system (TM042) following the manufacturer's conditions (Promega) and subsequently cloned into the KpnI/BglII polylinker site of the pGL3 Basic luciferase reporter vector (TM033). Minipreps were purified using the QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced with Applera BigDye Terminator v3.1 sequencing kit on an ABI 377 automated sequencer. Maxipreps were prepared with the GenElute HP plasmid Maxiprep kit (Sigma). Two different DNA preparations were used. Both Huh7 and HepG2 cells were used for transient transfection. Results were essentially the same; results from Huh7 cells are shown here. Huh7 cells in 96-well format (4 × 105 cells/well) were transiently transfected with 200 ng of the appropriate plasmid or control vector, 2 ng of pRL-TK co-transfector, and 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000, and the cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. Luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual luciferase reporter assay system (TM040, Promega). Results represent the mean from nine repeat experiments, each performed in sets of eight repeat wells. Two different assays were performed to test the functionality of the –3A→ G variant. In Vitro Transcription and Translation Assay—Two APOA5 cDNA clones (5′-UTR and coding sequence only), a kind gift from Len Pennacchio, were used: 3A/56C and –3G/56C. The cDNAs were subcloned into pGEM 7Zf driven from a T7 promoter (Promega) and confirmed by sequencing. The transcription/translation experiments were performed by means of the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). The plasmids were transcribed in vitro and translated by using the TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega TnT Quick transcription/translation system) following the manufacturer's protocol and using FluoroTect Green (Promega FluoroTect™ GreenLYS tRNA) to label newly synthesized protein. Size and quantification of the proteins were checked by SDS-PAGE, read on a Typhoon 8600 (Molecular Dynamics) at 532 nm excitation, and analyzed with ImageQuant software. Three separate DNA preparations of each clone were used, and samples were duplicated for each experiment. Primer Extension Inhibition (Toe Printing) Assay—To study the initiation AUG of protein synthesis, a primer extension inhibition assay (14.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) in rabbit reticulocyte lysates was used. The same constructs were used as in the transcription/translation assay. Plasmid DNA, linearized by digestion with EcoRI, provided the template for transcription by T7 RNA polymerase using the Riboprobe System-T7 (Promega) and Ribo m7G cap analog (Promega). Capped mRNAs were purified by extraction with phenol, concentrated by ethanol precipitation, resuspended in water, and stored at –70 °C. An oligonucleotide, AGAGGCCTCAGCTTTTCCAGG, labeled at the 5′ end with 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM), was used to prime the reverse transcriptase step. The fluorescently labeled primer was pre-annealed to the RNA by heating for 1 min at 65 °C followed by incubation at 37 °C for 8 min in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.2 mm EDTA. The primer-RNA complexes were then held on ice for ∼15 min, whereas the reticulocyte reaction mixtures were assembled. Ribosome binding reactions were carried out using a micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega). The reaction mixes contained 45% reticulocyte lysate, 90 μg/ml cycloheximide, 200 μm sparsomycin, 2 mm magnesium (CH3COO)2, and 100 mm potassium acetate. For the assay, 25-μl aliquots of this mixture containing 2 μl of mRNA/primer (0.1–0.2 μg of mRNA) were incubated at 25 °C for 6 min and then diluted with 20 volumes of cold buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 110 μg/ml cycloheximide, and each of the four dNTPs at 575 μm. Primer extension was initiated by adding 2 units/μl Superscript II reverse transcriptase to the mix and incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Reactions were stopped by extraction with phenol and precipitation with ethanol before resuspension in 10 μl of water. 2-μl aliquots, together with GeneScan-500 ROX (dichlororhodamine acceptor dye) size standards (Applera), were run on an ABI 377 automated sequencer and analyzed using GeneScan software. Experiments were repeated twice, each time in quadruplicate. To test the function of the 1891T→ C variant in the 3′-UTR, an 816-bp fragment was amplified by PCR from the DNA sample from an individual with haplotype APOA5*1 from +1752 to +2568 with a T at position 1891. Oligonucleotides were designed with XbaI sites at the 5′ end of the forward oligo and HpaI at the 5′ end of the reverse oligo. In addition, GG and CG tails were introduced at the 5′ ends of forward and reverse oligos. Oligonucleotides for the short fragments were as follows: forward primer, 5′-GCTCTAGA GGCCCATTCCCAGCTCCTTGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGGTTAACTGTGCTTTGGGGATAGTGGTGAGG-3′. PCR products were TA-cloned into pGEM-T vector system (TM042) following the manufacturer's conditions (Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the T→ C at position 1891 using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Subcloning into the XbaI/HpaI polylinker site 3′ of either the pGL3 control or promoter Luciferase reporter vector (TM033) followed. Minipreps were purified using the QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequenced with Applera BigDye Terminator v3.1 sequencing kit on an ABI 377 automated sequencer. Maxipreps were prepared with the GenElute HP plasmid Maxiprep kit (Sigma). Huh7 cell transfection and luciferase activity measures were carried out as described above for the –1131T→ C variant. Molecular Modeling of the apoAV Signal Peptide S19W Variant—The first 23 N-terminal residues of apoAV form a signal peptide. We had previously shown that signal peptides insert obliquely into the lipid membrane (15.Talmud P. Lins L. Brasseur R. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16.Brasseur R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This tilted orientation was important to the translocation activity of the signal peptide, with an angle of insertion of 45° giving the highest activity (15.Talmud P. Lins L. Brasseur R. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The most stable position in a modeled membrane for the Ser-19 SP and the Trp-19 SP are shown in Fig. 1. The Ser-19 SP assumes an angle of insertion relative to the phospholipids bilayer of 40°, with its mass center at 10 Å from the bilayer center. For the Trp-19 SP, the best position relative to the bilayer is at an angle of 65°, with its mass center at 5 Å. For comparison, modeling of the endogenous secretory alkaline phosphatase SP shows an angle of insertion of 40° relative to the bilayer plane with a mass center at 9 Å from the bilayer center (data not shown). This increase of the angle of insertion from 40° to 65° for Ser-19 compared with Trp-19 is predicted to lead to reduced “activity,” i.e. translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum. These predictions also suggest that the apoAV Ser-19 SP should work as efficiently as the endogenous SP when fused to SEAP. Influence of the APOA5 Signal Peptide Variant S19W on Secretory Alkaline Phosphatase Secretion—The effect of the substitution of the SEAP signal sequence by the APOA5 signal sequence, encoding either Ser or Trp at residue 19 and creating two different apoAV·SEAP fusion proteins, was examined. The secretion of alkaline phosphatase from HepG2 cells into the medium was then assayed quantitatively. As presented in Fig. 2, compared with control SEAP with its endogenous signal peptide, the apoAV wild type Ser-19 signal peptide acted effectively as a signal sequence, as predicted by the molecular modeling. However, substitution of Ser-19 by Trp-19 reduced the amount of secreted SEAP by 49% (p = 0.002), proving that this SNP is indeed functional. According to the manufacturer's protocol, the SEAP in the medium is directly proportional to the intracellular mRNA and protein. For this reason the intracellular concentration of the fusion proteins was not measured. Haplotype APOA5*2 is defined by four variant sites all in complete LD, namely –1131T→ C, -3A→ G, 715G→ T, and 1891T→ C. Of these variants, 715G→ T, 476 bp into intron 3, is unlikely to be functional and was not examined further. The potential functional effects of the other three variants were tested. Promoter –1131T→ C—This variant within the promoter of APOA5 could alter transcription, and in order to study this further, its effect on the expression of luciferase, acting as a reporter gene, was examined. To test whether –1131T→ C was acting independently or could be influenced by the –3A→ G change (with which it shows complete LD), four different constructs were made, two shorter fragments (from –1177 to –516) that included only the –1131 site, and two larger constructs that included in addition the –3 site (from –1177 to –3) in the naturally occurring combinations (–1131T/–3A and –1131C/–3G). The effects of these four constructs on luciferase expression in the luciferase dual assay are presented in Fig. 3. Results from nine separate experiments on two different DNA preparations (each with eight repeats) showed no significant difference between the –1131C or –1131T short constructs on luciferase expression (p = 0.53), although these constructs showed more than double the effect on luciferase activity compared with the pGL3 Basic vector. Similarly there was no statistically significant difference between the –1131T/–3A and –1131C/–3G constructs (p = 0.34), although both constructs showed significantly lower luciferase activity compared with the short constructs (p < 0.0001). Kozak Sequence –3A→ G—Two different assays were used to test the function of this variant. The in vitro transcription/translation assay was used to investigate whether the –3A→ G in the Kozak sequence affected the translation efficiency of –3G and –3A cDNAs. Evaluation was carried out by lysine fluorescence (a representative gel is shown in Fig. 4a), with the major band representing the translated apoAV proteins. Quantification of these results from three repeat experiments (Fig. 4b) shows that there was no significant difference (p = 0.59) in the fluorescence emission between the two constructs, establishing that the site at –3 was not influencing translation efficiency. This was confirmed by the complementary primer extension inhibition “toe printing” assay, which examines codon usage. The premise is that the –3A→ G change in the Kozak sequence could result in leaky translation, such that translation might start at an alternative AUG initiation site, because of poor discrimination. ApoAV has AUG codons at residues 1 and 4. The essence of this assay is that the interaction of ribosomes with mRNA can be limited to the initiation step by including antibiotics that inhibit elongation (14.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17.Kozak M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2482-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). A 5′ -fluorescently labeled oligo, 230 nt 3′ of the residue 1 start site and 221 nt 3′ of residue 4, was used to prime reverse transcriptase to the position of the bound ribosome. Representative electropherograms from the two constructs –3A or –3G are shown in Fig. 5. As expected, the full-length 5′ end product of 285 bp was visible. A 253-bp fragment was present for both constructs and is likely to represent an echo band (14.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As reported by Kozak (14.Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4853-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the 80 S ribosome bound to the AUG will protect 15–16 nt 3′ of the codon, and thus the expected bands, if both AUGs are used, should be 214 or 205 nt long. The peak at 209 nt probably represents the 80 S ribosome blocked codon 1 fragment, which is slightly shorter than expected, representing 21 nt blocked by the 80 S ribosome. This might be because of distortion by the fluorescent label. A small peak at 230 nt was seen with both constructs, which would be the expected size fragment corresponding to codon 1 usage. No peak at 221 nt (which would represent codon 4 usage) was seen. Importantly, no second additional peak representing the 9-nt shorter fragment was evident in the –3G construct. These results thus confirm results from the transcription/translation assay by demonstrating that only the AUG at residue 1 is used and the –3A→ G change does not result in leaky translation. 3′-UTR 1891T→ C—The function of the T→ C change in the 3′-UTR of APOA5, acting as a 3′-UTR for the luciferase gene, was tested in two different vectors, pGL3 control vector (which in addition to the SV40 promoter has the SV40 enhancer) and pGL3 promoter vector (which lacks the SV40 enhancer). There was no significant difference in the effect of the T or C construct on luciferase expression in either vector system (Fig. 6). The novel aspect of this study is the resolution of the functionality of APOA5 SNPs by demonstrating the altered signal peptide function of the APOA5*3 S19W and the lack of functional effects of any of the three APOA5*2 SNPs tested individually. Haplotype APOA5*3—56C→ G, resulting in S19W, introduces an aromatic amino acid, Trp, in exchange for a polar Ser at position –5 from the cleavage site of the apoAV signal peptide. Although the sequences of signal peptides are not highly conserved, they do observe certain constraints, with positively charged residues at the N terminus, a hydrophobic core, and neutral but polar residues at the C terminus (18.von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar). Amino acids at –3 and –1 relative to the cleavage site must be small and neutral for cleavage to occur (19.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). The rigidity of this requirement is borne out by the amino acid substitutions of Ala by Thr at the –1 cleavage site of vasopressin-neurophysin II (20.Siggaard C. Rittig S. Corydon T.J. Andreasen P.H. Jensen T.G. Andresen B.S. Robertson"
https://openalex.org/W2118835279,"Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) is a well-characterized murine model of human multiple sclerosis (MS) that closely resembles the chronic and progressive clinical form of the disease. Recent studies have described the involvement of the cannabinoid system in the progression of the disease and the benefits associated with the administration of cannabinoid agonists. With the objective to study whether ""indirect"" agonists, that is, compounds able to reinforce the physiological endocannabinoid transmission and, therefore, devoid of the psychotropic effects of ""direct"" agonists, could be suitable agents for the amelioration of MS neurological deficits, we administered the potent and selective anandamide uptake inhibitor UCM707 to TMEV-infected mice. Our results indicate that treatment during established disease significantly improves the motor function of the diseased mice. At the histological level, UCM707 is able to reduce microglial activation, diminish major histocompatibility complex class II antigen expression, and decrease cellular infiltrates in the spinal cord. Additionally, in microglial cells, UCM707 decreases the production of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6; reduces nitric oxide levels and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression; and is able to potentiate the action of a subeffective dose of the endocannabinoid anandamide. Overall, these results suggest that agents able to activate the endocannabinoid system could constitute a new series of drugs for the treatment of MS."
https://openalex.org/W2090232835,"The PML gene of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) encodes a cell-growth and tumor suppressor. PML localizes to discrete nuclear bodies (NBs) that are disrupted in APL cells, resulting from a reciprocal chromosome translocation t (15;17). Here we show that the nuclear localization of PML is also regulated by SUMO-3, one of the three recently identified SUMO isoforms in human cells. SUMO-3 bears similar subcellular distribution to those of SUMO-1 and -2 in the interphase nuclear body, which is colocalized with PML protein. However, both SUMO-2 and -3 are also localized to nucleoli, a region lacking SUMO-1. Immunoprecipitated PML protein bears SUMO-3 moiety in a covalently modified form, supporting the notion that PML is conjugated by SUMO-3. To determine the functional relevance of SUMO-3 conjugation on PML molecular dynamics, we suppressed SUMO-3 protein expression using a siRNA-mediated approach. Depletion of SUMO-3 markedly reduced the number of PML-containing NBa and their integrity, which is rescued by exogenous expression of SUMO-3 but not SUMO-1 or SUMO-2. The specific requirement of SUMO-3 for PML nuclear localization is validated by expression of SUMO-3 conjugation defective mutant. Moreover, we demonstrate that oligomerization of SUMO-3 is required for PML retention in the nucleus. Taken together, our studies provide first line of evidence showing that SUMO-3 is essential for PML localization and offer novel insight into the pathobiochemistry of APL."
https://openalex.org/W2055169194,"Testicular germ cell cancers remain one of the few solid tumors routinely cured in advanced stages with conventional cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The mechanisms remain largely unknown. Through use of gene-expression array profiling we define immediate transcriptional targets in response to cisplatin in testicular germ cell-derived human embryonal carcinoma cells. We report 46 genes upregulated and five genes repressed by cisplatin. Several of these gene products, including FAS, TRAILR3, PHLDA3, LRDD, and IER3 are previously implicated in the apoptotic death receptor pathway, while others including SESN1, FDXR, PLK3, and DDIT4 are known mediators of reactive oxygen species generation. Approximately 54% of the upregulated genes are established or suspected downstream targets of p53. Specific siRNA to p53 prevents cisplatin-mediated activation of p53 and p53 pathway genes and renders embryonal carcinoma cells relatively resistant to cisplatin cytotoxicity. Interestingly, in p53 knockdown cells nearly the entire set of identified cisplatin targets fail to respond or have a diminished response to cisplatin, suggesting that many are new direct or indirect targets of p53 including GPR87, STK17A, INPP5D, FLJ11259, and EPS8L2. The data indicate that robust transcriptional activation of p53 is linked to the known hypersensitivity of testicular germ cell tumors to chemotherapy. Many of the gene products may participate in the unique curability of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2071725100,"Activation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFR-β) leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of LRP and alters its association with adaptor and signaling proteins, such as Shc. The mechanism of the PDGF-induced LRP tyrosine phosphorylation is not well understood, especially since PDGF not only activates PDGF receptor but also binds directly to LRP. To gain insight into this mechanism, we used a chimeric receptor in which the ligand binding domain of the PDGFR-β was replaced with that from the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) receptor, a highly related receptor tyrosine kinase of the same subfamily, but with different ligand specificity. Activation of the chimeric receptor upon the addition of M-CSF readily mediated the tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP. Since M-CSF is not recognized by LRP, these results indicated that growth factor binding to LRP is not necessary for this phosphorylation event. Using a panel of cytoplasmic domain mutants of the chimeric M-CSF/PDGFR-β, we confirmed that the kinase domain of PDGFR-β is absolutely required for LRP tyrosine phosphorylation but that PDGFR-β-mediated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, RasGAP, SHP-2, phospholipase C-γ, and Src are not necessary for LRP tyrosine phosphorylation. To identify the cellular compartment where LRP and the PDGFR-β may interact, we employed immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy.

In the vasculature, LRP is expressed in smooth muscle cells, and a tissue-specific deletion of the LRP gene in vascular smooth muscle cell on a background of LDL receptor deficiency causes smooth muscle cell proliferation, aneurysm formation, and increased susceptibility to cholesterol-induced atherosclerosis (10Boucher P.

The mice demonstrated abnormal activation of PDGFR-β, and these effects could be inhibited by treatment of the mice with Gleevec, a known inhibitor of PDGF signaling. These studies indicate that LRP plays a role in protecting the integrity of the vascular wall and preventing atherosclerosis by controlling PDGFR activation. The mechanism by which LRP modulates PDGFR function remains unknown and may be related to the ability of the PDGFR-β to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain (11Boucher P.

For these studies, a CM5 BIAcore sensor chip was activated, and LRP was coupled as described (12Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M. Loukinov D. Ulery P. Mikhailenko I.

An additional flow cell, similarly activated and blocked without immobilization of protein, served as a negative control. A flow cell with immobilized ovalbumin at the level of 500 relative units was used as a control for nonspecific protein binding. All binding reactions were performed in 10 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4 (HBS-P buffer) (BIAcore, AB). The binding was measured at 25 °C at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 2 min followed by 2 min of dissociation. The bulk shift due to changes in refractive index measured on blank surfaces was subtracted from the binding signal at each condition to correct for nonspecific signals.

NIH/3T3 cells, SYF cells, SYF + c-Src cells, and WI-38 cells were purchased from the ATCC. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in 150-cm2 flasks in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum (5% for Ph cells). NIH/3T3 stable transfectant cells were supplemented in culture with 0.5 mg/ml G418. Ph cells were supplemented in culture with 1 mg/ml G418. Cells were plated out in 150-cm2 plates coated with 0.1% gelatin in 1× PBS. Upon reaching 70% confluency, cells were then incubated for 24 h in serum-free DMEM. Following serum starvation, cells were treated for 15 min with fresh serum-free DMEM supplemented with 40 ng/ml M-CSF, 50 ng/ml PDGF-A, or 40 ng/ml PDGF-B.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis were performed essentially as described (23Ranganathan S. Liu C.X. Migliorini M.M. Von Arnim C.A. Peltan I.D. Mikhailenko I. Hyman B.T. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40536-40544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were then prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)). After preclearing with rabbit IgG (10 μg) and protein G-Sepharose, lysates were immunoprecipitated with R2629 (10 μg) and protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed, separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% Tris-glycine precast gels (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. Following the addition of the detection antibody and horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody, the membranes were developed with chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce), and bands were visualized using Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). For visualizing the immunoprecipitated LRP, the membranes were stripped with Re-blot Western blot recycling kit (Chemicon International), blocked for 30 min in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS, 0.05% Tween 20, 1 mm CaCl2 (TBS-Tween buffer) at room temperature, and incubated with 11H4 (1 μg/ml) in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS-Tween buffer overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were then washed 3 × 15 min in TBS-Tween buffer and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L)-HRP conjugate secondary reagent (Bio-Rad) (1:3000) in TBS-Tween buffer at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were then washed 3 × 5 min and developed with chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce).Immunofluorescence Microscopy—WI-38 cells were grown in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum on glass coverslips coated with 0.1% gelatin in 1× PBS up to 70% confluency and then serum-starved for 24 h. After treatment with PDGF-B (40 ng/ml, 15 min, 37 °C), cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde, 5% sucrose in 1× PBS for 45 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.4% Triton X-100 for 5 min, blocked with 10% donkey serum for 1 h, and then incubated with primary antibody for 3 h at 37 °C. The affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-LRP antibody R2629 was used at 15 μg/ml, and goat anti-PDGFR-β antibody was used at 25 μg/ml in 1× PBS supplemented with 10% donkey serum. The coverslips were washed with 1× PBS and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 °C. The fluorescein isothiocyanate donkey anti-rabbit and rhodamine donkey anti-goat were used at 20 μg/ml. After washing, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using FluorSave reagent (Calbiochem). Confocal images were obtained on a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope using the Laser scanning system Radiance 2100 (Bio-Rad). Images were collected with Kalman averaging by Radiance 2100 software.Immunogold Electron Microscopy—WI-38 cells were fixed on cover glass at room temperature for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After three washes with 1× PBS (also applied between all following steps) and blocking with 10% normal goat serum for 10 min, the first primary antibody (anti-LRP, R2629) was applied for 2 h at room temperature followed by the second primary antibody (anti-PDGFR-β, goat) for 2 h. The secondary, IG gold antibodies were then applied for 1 h each, first the 25 nm gold-labeled anti-rabbit IgG and then the 15 nm gold-labeled anti-goat IgG. A second fixation with the same fixative (overnight) was followed by three washes with distilled water, post-fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide in distilled water, and graded dehydration through 50, 70, 95, and 3 times 100% ethanol and 2 times 100% propylene oxide (15 min each). Final embedding was in Epon 812, after which the cover glass was split away using liquid nitrogen; the specimens were trimmed and reoriented to be cut en face with a diamond knife. 50–70-nm-thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and then examined with a Philips CM12 transmission electron microscope.Co-immunoprecipitation of LRP and PDGFR-β—WI-38 cells were grown in culture as above to 70% confluency and then serum-starved overnight in serum-free DMEM containing 1% Nutridoma NS (Roche Applied Science). Cells were treated in triplicate for 15 min with 40 ng/ml PDGF-B. After stimulation, cell layers were washed with 1× PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and pooled together from the triplicate plates. After preclearing with non-immune goat IgG (10 μg/ml) and protein G-Sepharose, lysates were immunoprecipitated with D2642 goat anti-LRP IgG (10 μg/ml) and protein G-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and then boiled with 2× reducing SDS sample buffer for 5–10 min. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–12% Tris-glycine precast gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. Following transfer, membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and then incubated with anti-phospho-PDGFR-β (Tyr-857) antibody in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. Additional immunoblotting was performed as indicated previously.RESULTSGrowth Factor Binding to LRP Is Not Necessary for Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-mediated Phosphorylation—Recent studies found that PDGF-B mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain via PDGFR-β activation (11Boucher P. Liu P. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Anderson R.G. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15507-15513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 12Loukinova E. Ranganathan S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15499-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). LRP tyrosine phosphorylation is specific for PDGF, as other growth factors such as epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor-1 are unable to promote LRP tyrosine phosphorylation (12Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M. Loukinov D. Ulery P. Mikhailenko I. Lawrence D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15499-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PDGF directly binds to LRP, whereas epidermal growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor-1 are not recognized by LRP (12Loukinova E. Ranganathan S. Kuznetsov S. Gorlatova N. Migliorini M. Loukinov D. Ulery P. Mikhailenko I. Lawrence D.A. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15499-15506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These observations raise the possibility that PDGF-B may facilitate LRP tyrosine phosphorylation by bridging LRP to the activated PDGFR-β. To investigate the significance of the PDGF-B/LRP interaction and to determine whether association of growth factor with LRP is required for its tyrosine phosphorylation, we utilized a chimeric PDGFR-β that has been described by Fambrough et al. (24Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). This chimeric receptor, termed ChiR(WT), was generated by replacing the ligand binding domain of the PDGFR-β with that from the M-CSF receptor, a highly related receptor tyrosine kinase of the same subfamily but with different ligand specificity. This chimeric receptor functions normally in PDGF receptor signaling pathways but is activated by M-CSF (24Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Initially, we needed to determine whether M-CSF itself is capable of binding directly to LRP and investigated this possibility using surface plasmon resonance. The results (Fig. 1) reveal that even at high concentrations (100 nm), M-CSF was not recognized by LRP. As expected, PDGF-B (50 nm) and RAP (100 nm) were readily recognized by LRP. These results show that M-CSF does not bind to LRP and indicate that ChiR(WT) can be used to test the hypothesis that growth factor binding to LRP is important for the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP.To determine whether LRP tyrosine phosphorylation can be induced by activation of ChiR(WT), we incubated parental NIH/3T3 cells and NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with ChiR(WT) for 15 min at 37 °C with either PDGF-B or M-CSF. Following incubation, LRP was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-tyrosine 4G10 antibody and anti-LRP 11H4 antibody (Fig. 2). Treatment of NIH/3T3 cells with PDGF-B resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 2, lane 2), whereas treatment of these parental cells with M-CSF had no effect on LRP tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 2, lane 3) due to their lack of any endogenous response to M-CSF. In the transfected NIH/3T3 cells, which express both endogenous PDGFR-β and ChiR(WT), tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP was induced upon treatment with both PDGF-B and M-CSF (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6, respectively). We noticed that the basal levels of phosphorylated LRP and phosphorylated PDGFR-β were higher in the transfected cells than in the parental cells (Fig. 2, compare lanes 4 and 1). This was most likely due to ChiR(WT) overexpression in the transfected cells. Overall, the results revealed that tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP cytoplasmic domain occurs via activation of either PDGFR-β or ChiR(WT). Since M-CSF does not interact directly with LRP, it appears that growth factor binding to LRP is not a necessity for its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by the PDGFR-β.Fig. 2Activation of ChiR(WT) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP. Parental NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with the M-CSF/PDGFR-β chimeric receptor (ChiR(WT)) were grown in culture, treated for 15 min at 37 °C with either no growth factor (lanes 1 and 4) or 40 ng/ml PDGF-B (lanes 2 and 5) or M-CSF (lanes 3 and 6), and then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP polyclonal R2629. Immunoprecipitates (IP) or cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes containing immunoprecipitated proteins were probed with anti-phospho-tyrosine 4G10 antibody (p-Y) and anti-LRP 11H4 antibody (LRP). Membranes containing cell lysates were probed with anti-phospho-PDGFR-β (p-PDGFR-β), anti-PDGFR-β (PDGFR-β), anti-actin, and anti-human M-CSF receptor (hM-CSF R) antibodies.

Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) have developed a kinase-dead chimeric receptor, referred to as ChiR(KD), in which lysine 634 is mutated to arginine. Lysine 634 is located in the first tyrosine kinase domain of the cytoplasmic domain of PDGFR-β, and its conversion to arginine results in the complete inhibition of kinase activity of PDGFR-β (24Fambrough D. McClure K. Kazlauskas A. Lander E.S. Cell. 1999; 97: 727-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The results reveal that NIH/3T3 cells stably transfected with ChiR(KD) were unable to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP in response to M-CSF treatment (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4). In addition, ChiR(KD) was also not phosphorylated in response to M-CSF treatment. These data confirmed that tyrosine kinase activity of the PDGFR-β is necessary for LRP tyrosine phosphorylation.Fig. 3Kinase-dead chimeric forms of the PDGFR-β fail to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP. Parental NIH/3T3 fibroblasts and NIH/3T3 fibroblasts stably transfected with either the F5 or KD mutant forms of the M-CSF/PDGFR-β chimeric receptor (ChiR(F5) and ChiR(KD)) were grown in culture, treated for 15 min at 37 °C with either no growth factor (lanes 1, 3, and 5) or 40 ng/ml M-CSF (lanes 2, 4, and 6), and then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-LRP polyclonal R2629.

https://openalex.org/W2037083050,"Annexin A6 is a calcium-dependent membrane-binding protein that interacts with signalling proteins, including the GTPase-activating protein p120GAP, one of the most important inactivators of Ras. Since we have demonstrated that annexin A6 inhibits EGF- and TPA-induced Ras signalling, we investigated whether modulation of Ras activity by annexin A6 was mediated via altered subcellular localization of p120GAP. First, we exploited our observation that high-density lipoproteins (HDL) can activate the Ras/MAP kinase pathway. Expression of annexin A6 caused a significant reduction in HDL-induced activation of Ras and Raf-1. Annexin A6 promoted membrane binding of p120GAP in vitro, and plasma membrane targeting of p120GAP in living cells, both in a Ca2+-dependent manner, which is consistent with annexin A6 promoting the Ca2+-dependent assembly of p120GAP-Ras at the plasma membrane. We then extended these studies to other cell types and stimuli. Expression of annexin A6 in A431 cells reduced, while RNAi-mediated suppression of annexin A6 in HeLa cells enhanced EGF-induced Ras and Erk activation. Importantly, the enhancement of Ras activation following RNAi-mediated reduction in p120GAP levels was more marked in annexin A6-expressing A431 cells than controls, indicating that the effect of annexin A6 on Ras was mediated via p120GAP. Finally, we demonstrated that annexin A6 promotes plasma membrane targeting of p120GAP in A431 cells in response to a variety of stimuli, resulting in colocalization with H-Ras. These findings demonstrate an important role for annexin A6 in regulating plasma membrane localization of p120GAP and hence Ras activity."
https://openalex.org/W2156342932,"The apolipoprotein AV gene (APOA5) is a key determinant of plasma triglyceride levels, a major risk factor for coronary artery disease and a biomarker for the metabolic syndrome. Since thyroid hormones influence very low density lipoprotein triglyceride metabolism and clinical studies have demonstrated an inverse correlation between thyroid status and plasma triglyceride levels, we examined whether APOA5 is regulated by thyroid hormone. Here we report that 3,5,3′-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) and a synthetic thyroid receptor β (TRβ) ligand increase APOA5 mRNA and protein levels in hepatocytes. Our data revealed that T3-activated TR directly regulates APOA5 promoter through a functional direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR4). Interestingly, we show that upstream stimulatory factor 1, a transcription factor associated with familial combined hyperlipidemia and elevated triglyceride levels in humans, and upstream stimulatory factor 2 cooperate with TR, resulting in a synergistic activation of APOA5 promoter in a ligand-dependent manner via an adjacent E-box motif. In rats, we observed that apoAV levels declines with thyroid hormone depletion but returned to normal levels upon T3 administration. In addition, treatments with a TRβ-selective agonist increased apoAV and diminished triglyceride levels. The identification of APOA5 as a T3 target gene provides a new potential mechanism whereby thyroid hormones can influence triglyceride homeostasis.

At present, the molecular mechanisms by which TH may regulate lipase activities and circulating TG levels in humans remain to be defined. 3,5,3′-Triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) exerts its biological actions through binding to specific nuclear receptors that modulate gene expression (12Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Typically, the T3 receptor (TR) complexes with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) to form a heterodimer that binds to specific DNA sequence elements known as TREs, composed of two half-core PuGGTCA motifs with specific nucleotide spacing and orientation (13Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). There are several TRs, which are encoded by two distinct genes, TRα (NR1A1) and TRβ (NR1A2). The TRα gene gives rise to the ligand-binding protein TRα1 and splice variants that do not bind T3. Several amino-terminal protein variants are produced from the TRβ gene: TRβ1; TRβ2, which is largely restricted to anterior pituitary and hypothalamus (12Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar); and the two recently identified, low level expressed, TRβ3 and TRΔβ3 (14Williams G.R. Mol. Cell.

The widely expressed isoforms TRα1 and TRβ1 have divergent N-terminal regions but display remarkably sequence homology throughout the rest, especially in their DNA binding domains (12Yen P.M.

Ageing Dev. 2004; 125: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). As a consequence, both isoforms can bind T3 with similar affinities, and heterodimers of RXR and either TR isoform recognize the same motifs on DNA (12Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Despite their structural similarities, distinct patterns of expression of TRs may account for isoform-specific phenotypic functional differences observed in in vivo investigations (12Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). In the liver, TRβ1 is the predominant receptor isoform, representing 80% of T3-binding activity (16Schwartz H.L.

The administration of thyroid hormones lowers plasma cholesterol in hypothyroid patients. Unfortunately, the natural TH cannot be used therapeutically to treat hypercholesterolemia in euthyroid individuals because they have undesirable effects in the heart, where TRα1 is the predominant isoform (12Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). These differences in TR isoform expression, together with the fact that TRα1 and TRβ1 isoforms can bind TH analogs with subtle differences in affinity, have spawned attempts to develop thyromimetics with higher selectivity toward TRβ1 versus TRα1 that may have cholesterol-lowering effects but minimal cardiac toxicity (12Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar). Apolipoproteins (apo) play a determinant role in lipid homeostasis. Alterations in the levels of these functionally specialized proteins dramatically influence plasma lipid concentrations. Recently, the gene coding for a new apolipoprotein family member, APOA5, was identified 30 kb proximal to the APOA1/C3/A4 gene cluster and shown to be a major determinant of plasma TG levels (24Pennacchio L.A.

Furthermore, inherited apoAV deficiency is associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia in humans (31Oliva C.P. Pisciotta L. Li Volti G. Sambataro M.P. Cantafora A. Bellocchio A. Catapano A. Tarugi P.

ApoAV is a highly hydrophobic protein mainly expressed in liver that circulates at low concentrations associated with high density lipoprotein (24Pennacchio L.A. Olivier M. Hubacek J.A. Cohen J.C.

Inasmuch as apoAV concentration is a key determinant of plasma TG levels and since the apolipoprotein gene family is highly regulated at the transcriptional level (33Zannis V.I. Kan H.Y. Kritis A. Zanni E.E. Kardassis D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 181-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), recent research has been oriented to the identification of factors that control APOA5 expression. Little is known regarding the transcriptional regulation of this newly discovered gene, although it has been shown to date that APOA5 is regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (NR1C1), farnesoid X-activated receptor (NR1H4), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, all of which are transcription factors directly implicated in triglyceride metabolism (34Vu-Dac N.

In this study, we provide evidence that T3 induces APOA5 expression. Furthermore, our findings reveal that TR directly regulates APOA5 in a ligand-dependent manner via a functional TRE within the promoter. In addition, in rats in vivo, apoAV content correlated with thyroid status, and moreover a TRβ ligand increased apoAV and simultaneously diminished TG levels. Therefore, our findings provide evidence for molecular crosstalk between thyroid status and intravascular TG metabolism. Plasmids—Constructs p-1422/+18hAvLUC, p-617/+18hAvLUC, p-437/+18hAvLUC, p-242/+18hAvLUC, and p-82/+18hAvLUC containing the corresponding sequences of the 5′-flanking region of the human APOA5 gene cloned in front of the promoterless firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase gene have been previously described (35Prieur X. Coste H. Rodríguez J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25468-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the construct p-617/+18hAvLUC was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer and two pairs of oligonucleotides containing mutations corresponding, respectively, to nt –109C→ T/–108A→ T/–101G→ A/–100T→ A and to nt –80A→ C/–77T→ C of the human APOA5 promoter. The vector pGL3-TK contains a fragment corresponding to nt –109 to +20 of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene promoter of herpes simplex virus (36Jakel H. Nowak M. Moitrot E. Dehondt H. Hum D.W.

The reporter plasmids p(AVDR4)n-TK (n = 1–5) were generated by insertion of 1–5 copies of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing wild type (5′-GAT CCT GGG AGG CAG CTG AGG TCA ACT TA-3′) or mutant (5′-GAT CCT GGG AAG TTG CTG AGA ACA ACT TA-3′) sequences spanning nt –117 to –94 of human apoAV promoter into the BglII site of pGL3-TK. Plasmids expressing human cDNAs for TRα1 and TRβ1 were provided by J. A. Holt (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC). Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen endotoxin-free maxipreparation method and quantified spectrophotometrically. The integrities of all plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Transfection and Reporter Assays—Human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells were cultured in Eagle's basal medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (medium A), and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. On day 0, cells were seeded on 24-well plates at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well. On day 1, cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Typically, each well of a 24-well plate received 200 ng of firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 100 ng of a plasmid expressing human TRα1, TRβ1, and/or USF. Effector plasmid dosage was kept constant by the addition of appropriate amounts of the empty expression vector pSG5. 100 ng/well of a sea pansy (Renilla reniformis) luciferase plasmid pRL-null (Promega) was included in all transfections as an internal control for transfection efficiency. On day 2, cells were switched to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate (medium B) and 1% (v/v) delipidated calf serum (Sigma) and containing, when indicated, T3 (Sigma), N-[3,5-dimethyl-4-(4′-hydroxy-3′-isopropylphenoxy)-phenyl]-oxamic acid (CGS-23425) (Novartis), or vehicle (water or Me2SO, respectively). On day 3, cell lysates were prepared by shaking the cells in 200 μl of 1× Promega lysis buffer for 15 min at room temperature. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega) and a Lumistar luminometer (BMG Lab Technologies). Firefly luciferase activity values were divided by Renilla luciferase activity values to obtain normalized luciferase activities. To facilitate comparisons within a given experiment, activity data were presented either as relative luciferase activities or as -fold induction over the normalized activity of the reporter plasmid in the absence of nuclear receptor cotransfection and agonist supplementation. The data are expressed as the means ± S.D. Statistic significance analyses were done with Student's t test. Cell Treatments—On day 0, human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells or rat hepatoma McArdle-RH7777 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were plated on 24-well plates at 5 × 105 or 105 cells/well, respectively, in medium A and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, and 10% (v/v) horse serum, respectively. On day 2, cells were refed with medium B supplemented with 1% (v/v) delipidated calf serum (Sigma), and T3 (Sigma), CGS-23425 (Novartis) or vehicle (water or Me2SO, respectively). On day 3, cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested for isolation of RNA or Western analysis. Human primary hepatocytes in 24-well plates fed with Williams E medium supplemented with 100 nm dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 4 μg/ml insulin (medium C), and 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum were provided on day 0 by Biopredict (batch Hep220069 MW24). On day 1, cells were refed with medium C supplemented with 1% (v/v) delipidated calf serum and containing 50 nm T3, 10 nm CGS-23425, or vehicle (water or Me2SO, respectively). After 24 h, the medium was replaced by 500 μl/well fresh medium C containing 50 nm T3, 10 nm CGS-23425, or vehicle (water or Me2SO, respectively). After 6 h, media were collected, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested for isolation of RNA or Western analysis. Western Blot Analysis—For determination of secreted apoAV, media from triplicate wells were pooled, and proteins were precipitated by the addition of 180 μl of trichloroacetic acid (Sigma) and agitation overnight at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 2 × 104g at 4 °C for 15 min, protein pellets were washed twice in 500 μl of cold acetone, dried at room temperature, and resuspended in 100 μl of 1× NuPage LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). For determination of cellular apoAV, whole cell lysates were prepared by shaking the cells on 24-well plates in 100 μl/well lysis buffer A (PBS, 1% Triton, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture from Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 104 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. 60-μl aliquots of resuspended samples from the incubation media and 40 μg of proteins from whole cell lysates were boiled at 100 °C for 5 min, electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide MOPS NuPAGE® Novex gels (Invitrogen), and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes in NuPAGE® transfer buffer (Invitrogen). Membranes were preincubated for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer, 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). Subsequently, blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-human apoAV, rabbit anti-rat apoAV (25van der Vliet H.N. Sammels M.G. Leegwater A.C. Levels J.H. Reitsma P.H. Boers W.

After washing five times in PBST for 5 min, blots were incubated with IRDye™ infrared dye 38 (800 nm; Rockland Immunochemicals) and Alexa Fluor® 680 (700 nm; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) labeled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies diluted at 1:5000 in PBST for 1 h at room temperature. Signals were detected by using Odyssey™ Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR). Real-time PCR Quantification of mRNAs—Total RNA was prepared from human primary hepatocytes, HepG2, and rat McArdle cells with the RNeasy™ Mini kit, the QIAshredder™ homogenizers, and the RNase-free DNase set (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Human normal liver total RNA was purchased from BD Biosciences (reference number 64099-1, batch 4120140; Caucasian 51-year-old man, sudden death). A 1-μg aliquot was used as a template for cDNA synthesis employing the TaqMan™ Reverse Transcription Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed with Primer Express Software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequences of forward and reverse primers used for the amplifications are as follows: 18 S, 5′-GGG AGC CTG AGA AAC GGC-3′ and 5′-GGG TCG GGA GTG GGT AAT TT-3′; hTRα1, 5′-CAG CCG CTT CCT CCA CAT-3′ and 5′-CCG CCT GAG GCT TTA GAC TT-3′; hTRβ1, 5′-CTG CAC ATG AAG GTG GAA TG-3′ and 5′-TCG AAC ACT TCC AGG AAC AA-3′; cyclophilin, 5′-CAT CTG CAC TGC CAA GAC TGA-3′ and 5′-CCA CAA TAT TCA TGC CTT CTT TCA-3′; hAPOC3, 5′-CTT CTC AGC TTC ATG CAG GGT TA-3′ and 5′-ACG CTG CTC AGT GCA TCC TT-3′; hLDLr, 5′-GTT GCT GGC AGA GGA AAT GAG AAG-3′ and 5′-CAA AGG AAG ACG AGG AGC ACG AT-3′; hAPOA5, 5′-AGC TGG TGG GCT GGA ATT T-3′ and 5′-GGC CAC CTG CTC CAT CAG-3′; and rAPOA5, 5′-ACA CGG TCG AGC TGA TGG-3′ and 5′-GGC CTT GGT GCC TTT TCC-3′, respectively. The specificity and efficiency of the primers were validated as previously described (35Prieur X. Coste H. Rodríguez J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25468-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The reactions contained 4 μl of diluted (1:10) cDNA, a 300 nm concentration of the forward and reverse primers, and 2× SYBR™ Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) in a final volume of 20 μl. Real-time PCRs were carried out in 384-well plates by using the ABI PRISM™ 7900 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Levels of TRα1 and TRβ1 were normalized by 18 S to compensate for variations in input RNA amounts. Levels of APOA5, APOC3, and LDLr were normalized to cyclophilin to compensate for variations in input RNA amounts (cyclophilin levels were unaffected by the treatments). The amounts of mRNAs were calculated using the comparative CT method as described in Ref. 38Biosystems Applied User Bulletin. Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA2001: 2Google Scholar. All assays were performed in triplicate during two independent experiments, and the reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCRs were carried out in duplicate for each sample. In Vitro Transcription/Translation and EMSAs—TRα, RXRα, USF1, and USF2 proteins were synthesized in vitro from the expression plasmid by using TnT® Quick Coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In order to obtain an unprogrammed lysate as a negative control for EMSA, a reaction was performed with the empty vector pSG5. Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence spanning nt –117 to –94 and nt –88 to –69 of human APOA5 promoter (AVDR4 and AVEbox, respectively) or modified versions harboring mutations in the DR4 hexamers and E-box described under “Plasmids” (mutAVDR4 and mutAVE, respectively) were radiolabeled by fill in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and used as probes. The control probes contain the DR4 sequence of the human TRβ proximal TR response element (39Suzuki S. Miyamoto T. Opsahl A. Sakurai A. DeGroot L.J. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2033181127,"Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) regulates transcription of specific genes and is believed to play a major role in breast tumorigenesis. We previously identified estrogen down regulated gene 1 (EDG1 (also known as HEXIM1)) using the C-terminus of ERα (E/F domain) as bait in yeast two-hybrid screenings. Here we report on the role of EDG1 as a coregulator of ERα transcriptional activity. We observe an interaction between EDG1 and ERα. EDG1 inhibits the transcriptional activity of ERα and this is dependent upon the C-terminus of EDG1. The C-terminus of EDG1/HEXIM1 was recently shown to inhibit the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) by interacting with the cyclin T1 subunit. Here we show that ERα interacts with cyclin T1, cyclin T1 and ER co-occupancy on the promoter region of an ER target gene, and that this interaction plays an important role in ERα-induced gene expression. The interaction of ERα with cyclin T1 also allows ERα to compete with EDG1 for cyclin T1, and may release cyclin T1 from EDG1 repression. Conversely, increased EDG1 expression results in inhibition of cyclin T1 recruitment and ERα DNA binding. Our results support a novel functional interaction between ERα and cyclin T1 that is modulated by EDG1."

Most of these disorders are associated with aging and a probable impairment of the proteasome-proteolytic pathway, although the relationship between aging, proteasome inhibition, and α-synuclein toxicity has not been fully elucidated. Recent studies suggest that yeast may provide a useful system for studying the biology and toxicity of α-synuclein in mitotic cells, recapitulating many features observed in the various synucleinopathy disorders. Additional studies indicate that the stationary phase model of aging in yeast provides a useful system for understanding the biochemistry and regulation of aging in post-mitotic cells. In the present study we examined the effect of wild type and mutant α-synuclein (A30P) on multiple aspects of proteasome homeostasis, protein synthesis, as well as the ability of cells to survive stationary phase aging. These data demonstrate that α-synuclein alters proteasome composition, impairs proteasome-mediated protein degradation, impairs protein synthesis, and impairs the ability of cells to withstand stationary phase aging. Interestingly, α-synuclein had little effect on intracellular proteasome content or protein ubiquitination, and did not increase the vulnerability of cells to a variety of stressors. Together, these data suggest that yeast may be useful for understanding the ability of α-synuclein to impair proteasome-mediated protein degradation, as well as for understanding the basis for age-related α-synuclein cytotoxicity. α-Synuclein appears to play a role in mediating neurotoxicity in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, collectively referred to as synucleinopathies.

Familial forms of most synucleinopathies have also been documented, with strong experimental and genetic evidence indicating that many familial forms of synucleinopathy disorders are mediated by the presence of mutations in α-synuclein (6Polymeropoulos M.H.

The basis for α-synuclein toxicity has not been fully elucidated, although mutations in α-synuclein are believed to contribute to cellular toxicity by altering the normal structure and/or function of α-synuclein (8Conway K.A.

In both sporadic and familial forms of the different synucleinopathy disorders age is the biggest risk factor for disease onset, although cellular basis for this observation remains to be elucidated. A variety of in vitro and in vivo models have been developed to understand the molecular and cellular basis of α-synuclein toxicity (12Hashimoto M. Rockenstein E. Masliah E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that yeast are also useful in studying the biochemistry and regulation of aging in both mitotic and post-mitotic cells (20Sinclair D.A. Cell Mol.

For the analysis of post-mitotic cell aging, stationary phase or chronological yeast aging has been demonstrated to recapitulate multiple features of aging that are present during the aging of post-mitotic mammalian cells (19Chen Q. Ding Q. Keller J.N. Biogerontology. 2005; 6: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 20Sinclair D.A. Cell Mol.

Additionally, the stationary phase model of aging has allowed for the identification of genetic manipulations that may have beneficial effects toward the aging of mammalian cells (20Sinclair D.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Fabrizio P. Li L. Longo V.D. Mech.

Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar).In the present study we conducted experimentation to understand the effects of wild type and mutant α-synuclein toward multiple aspects of cellular homeostasis including proteasome function, protein synthesis, and the ability to survive stationary phase aging. These data demonstrate that α-synuclein has dramatic effects on proteasome-mediated protein degradation, protein synthesis, and impairs the ability of post-mitotic cells to survive stationary phase aging. Together, these data contribute to our understanding of α-synuclein-induced cytotoxicity, and suggest that yeast may be particularly useful for studying the effects of α-synuclein on steady state protein expression, as well as the aging-related cytotoxicity that is observed in a variety of synucleinopathies.MATERIALS AND METHODSTransformation and Propagation of Yeast Cultures—Wild type and mutant α-synuclein, as well as full-length human tau, were amplified from plasmids of pcDNA3.1 containing the full-length form of the indicated gene (Gift from Dr. Rodney Guttmann). The resulting PCR fragment, of the correct size, was ligated into pADGal4 to generate the constitutive expression plasmids pAD/Syn, pAD/Syn-A30P, or pAD/tau. These expression plasmids together with empty pADGAL4 vector were then transformed (25Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2878) Google Scholar) into yeast strain BY4742 obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Y201389). The stably transformed colonies were selected on SD(–LEU) plates. The individual colonies were then randomly picked up and grown in SD(–LEU) medium to reach stationary phase (26Longo V.D. Gralla E.B.

Identical results were obtained whether cells were maintained in expired medium or water (data not shown).Analysis of α-Synuclein Expression—The yeast cells containing pAD-GAl4 vector, pAD/Syn, and pAD/Syn-AP were grown in SD(–LEU) medium and 1 ml of each cell culture was harvested, respectively, on days 1 and 7 of stationary phase for RNA preparation. Total yeast RNA was extracted by TRI reagent (Sigma), and 2.0 μg of total RNA was used in in vitro reverse transcription (RT) 1The abbreviation used is: RT, reverse transcription. -PCR by the SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The RT-PCR was performed for 30 min at 42 °C followed by 25 repeating cycles of 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Primers used for RT-PCR were the same used for synuclein cloning as above. Primers used for 18 S control were: 5′-TTAATGACCCACTCGGCACC-3′ and 5′-CCATCGGCTTGAAACCGATA-3′. To examine the expression of synuclein, we conducted Western blot analysis as described previously (29Ramos P.C. Hockendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 30Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada N. Mizushima Y. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). The expression of tau was also confirmed by Western blot analysis. Equal amounts of cellular lysate (50 μg) were separated using a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and probed for synuclein using an anti-synuclein monoclonal antibody or tau antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Rodney Guttmann).Analysis of Cellular Viability—Cell viability was determined by monitoring the ability of cells to support a viable colony. All yeast cells were initially seeded at an OD of 0.1 and grown in the same volume of SD(–LEU) medium. On days 4, 7, 14, and 21, the same volume of yeast cells were collected and diluted 10, 100, and 1,000 times. Then 5 μl of yeast cells from each diluted cell were loaded to YPD plates and grown at 30 °C for 2–3 days. Similar results were obtained whether cells were maintained in expired medium or water (data not shown).Analysis of the Ability of Cells to Support Viable Colonies following Oxidative Stressors and Inhibitors of Protein Synthesis—An equal number of pre-cultured yeast cells were transferred to fresh SD(–LEU) medium (by 1:10 dilution) containing 1 mm hydrogen peroxide, 250 μm menadione, 1 μg/ml actinomycin D, or 50 μm, and grown at 30 °C for 2 h. Then same volume of yeast cells were then collected and subjected to a serial dilution, with 5 μl of yeast cells from each respective dilution loaded onto YPD plates and grown at 30 °C for 2 days.Analysis of Proteasome-mediated Protein Degradation, and Protein Synthesis—Proteasome-mediated protein degradation was quantified by determining the rates of short-lived protein degradation as described previously (28Chen Q. Thorpe J. Ding Q. El-Amouri I.S. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Chen Q. Ding Q. Thorpe J. Dohmen R.J. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4773-4781Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), with some minor modification. Briefly, yeast cells were grown exponentially at 30 °C in SD(–LEU) medium. To measure the breakdown of short-lived proteins, the same number of cells were washed and transferred to methionine-free SD medium and then labeled for 5 min with 50 μCi of [35S]methionine. After two washes, cells were resuspended in fresh SD medium containing methionine (0.5 mg/ml) and cycloheximide (0.5 mg/ml) to prevent the incorporation of radioactive amino acids released from proteins. At different intervals aliquots of cells were taken, and the cells were broken with acid-washed glass beads. The lysate was mixed with 100% trichloroacetic acid to yield a final concentration of 10% trichloroacetic acid (v/v). After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the samples were centrifuged, and the radioactivity (cpm) in the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material (precipitates) was measured. For quantification of protein synthesis, the radioactivity (cpm) in the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material (precipitate) was measured following labeling with methionine (50 μCi), followed by immediate precipitation with trichloroacetic acid.Analysis of Protein Ubiquitination—Equal amounts of cellular lysate (50 μg) were separated using 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel, and probed for ubiquitin using anti-ubiquitin antibodies (Chemicon, StressGen).Purification of Proteasome Complex—Yeast 20 S proteasomes were purified using a modified version of previously published protocols (33Glickman M.H.

Briefly, yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation (2000 × g for 5 min) and then washed with ice-cold stop buffer (0.9% NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF). The resulting cell pellet was then resuspended in 20 S proteasome activity buffer (35Ding Q. Reinacker K. Dimayuga E. Nukala V. Drake J. Butterfield D.A. Dunn J.C. Martin S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Keller J.N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and the cells were lysed with acid-washed glass beads. The extract was clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 15 min) and the resulting supernatant was then loaded onto a Hitrap Q HP column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with a 5-fold column volume of proteasome activity buffer (35Ding Q. Reinacker K. Dimayuga E. Nukala V. Drake J. Butterfield D.A. Dunn J.C. Martin S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Keller J.N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and then eluted with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl. The purified proteasome fraction was identified by quantifying the chymotryspin-like activity of the 20 S proteasome (33Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kheradpezhouh M. Shavali S. Ebadi M. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in each of the resulting fractions.Analysis of Proteasome Composition, and Quantification of Individual Proteolytic Activities in the Purified Proteasome Complex—To determine the composition of the proteasome, the proteasome fraction was dialyzed using membrane tubing, and 20 μg of protein from each dialysate were taken for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The two-dimensional procedures were performed as described previously by our laboratory (28Chen Q. Thorpe J. Ding Q. El-Amouri I.S. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Chen Q. Ding Q. Thorpe J. Dohmen R.J. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), following the manufacture's recommendations. Briefly, the samples were dissolved in sample buffer and loaded onto 11-cm ReadyStrip IPG strips with a pH range from 4 to 7 for overnight rehydration. The protein were then focused using the following parameters: 200 V for 5 h, 1,000 V for 5 h, and 3,000 V for 12 h. The strips were then equilibrated and run in 8–16% Tris-HCl gels at 200 V for 1 h. The individual spots were detected using a silver staining kit (Amersham Biosciences). The individual chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and post-glutamyl peptidase activities of the purified 20 S proteasome (1 μg) were quantified by monitoring the cleavage of the peptide substrates specific for each individual activity as described previously from our laboratory (35Ding Q. Reinacker K. Dimayuga E. Nukala V. Drake J. Butterfield D.A. Dunn J.C. Martin S. Bruce-Keller A.J. Keller J.N. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).RESULTSGeneration of Cells Expressing Wild Type and Mutant α-Synuclein—In the present study we generated yeast that were stably transformed with either full-length wild type or mutant α-synuclein (Fig. 1A). Cells transformed with wild type or mutant α-synuclein exhibited a similar and significant amount of α-synuclein expression (Fig. 1, B and C), with no expression of α-synuclein observed in cells transformed with empty vector. The expression of either wild type or mutant α-synuclein did not appear to affect cell growth (Fig. 1D), or alter cellular morphology (data not shown), during normal growth conditions. The expression of α-synuclein appeared to be unchanged even at day 7 stationary phase (data not shown).Wild Type and Mutant α-Synuclein Alter Proteasome-mediated Protein Degradation—To elucidate whether α-synuclein alters proteasome-mediated protein degradation, we quantified short-lived protein degradation, which is predominantly mediated by the proteasome (28Chen Q. Thorpe J. Ding Q. El-Amouri I.S. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 37: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Chen Q. Ding Q. Thorpe J. Dohmen R.J. Keller J.N. Free Radic. Biol.

Goldberg A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27280-27284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), in cells stably transformed with α-synuclein. During normal growth conditions there was a significant impairment in proteasome-mediated protein degradation in cells expressing wild type α-synuclein (Fig. 2A), which was even more pronounced in cells expressing mutant α-synuclein (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, cells expressing mutant α-synuclein exhibited a nearly complete inhibition of short-lived protein degradation (Fig. 2A). We next examined proteasome-mediated protein degradation in cells at the earliest stage of stationary phase aging (day 4) (20Sinclair D.A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 807-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 21Fabrizio P. Li L. Longo V.D. Mech.

Med. 2005; 38: 226-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), to elucidate what effect stationary phase aging had on cells expressing α-synuclein. Both wild type and mutant α-synuclein exhibited a nearly complete ablation of short-lived protein degradation (Fig. 2B), whereas short-lived protein degradation in cells expressing empty vector exhibited a preservation of some proteasome activity. To ensure that the observed results were specific for α-synuclein, we conducted identical analysis using cells that have been stably transformed with full-length human tau (a cytoskeletal protein involved in Alzheimer disease), using the same promoter and expression vector as outlined for α-synuclein. In these studies we observed that there was no significant effect of tau expression on protein degradation (day 1 tau expressing cells, 100% ± 4; day 4 tau expressing cells, 92% ± 5, data expressed as percent of control values, mean ± S.E.). These data are consistent with previous studies using reporters for proteasome-mediated protein degradation (17Outeiro T.F. Lindquist S. Science. 2003; 302: 1772-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 38Johnson E.S. Bartel B. Seufert W. Varshavsky A.

A, proteasome-mediated protein degradation was analyzed by quantifying the amount of short-lived protein degradation in cells transformed with empty vector, wild type α-synuclein (Syn), or mutant α-synuclein (A30P) under normal growth conditions. B, proteasome-mediated protein degradation was analyzed by quantifying the amount of short-lived protein degradation in cells transformed with empty vector, wild type α-synuclein (Syn), or mutant α-synuclein (A30P) at day 4 stationary phase. C, the amount of protein ubiquitination was quantified by Western blot analysis using empty vector, wild type α-synuclein (Syn), or mutant α-synuclein (A30P) under normal growth conditions (Day 1) or day 4 stationary phase conditions (Day 4). Molecular masses are indicated in kDa, and the arrow indicates the position of free ubiquitin at 9 kDa. An equal amount of protein (50 g) was loaded onto each lane for analysis of ubiquitin levels. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of results from three separate experiments. *, p < 0.05 compared with vector-transformed cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine whether the alterations in short-lived protein degradation were associated with alterations in the amount of protein ubiquitination, we conducted Western blot analysis of protein ubiquitination at days 1 and 4 stationary phase. These studies revealed that there was no significant difference between the amount of protein ubiquitination present in vector and α-synuclein expressing cells under normal growth conditions at day 1 (Fig. 2C). The amount of protein ubiquitination was significantly reduced in all cell types at day 4 stationary phase, as compared with normal growth conditions (Fig. 2C). At day 4 stationary phase, α-synuclein expressing cells exhibit a modest increase in protein ubiquitination, evident at a variety of molecular weights, as compared with vector-transformed cells (Fig. 2C). A band corresponding with free ubiquitin revealed that at day 4 stationary phase the amount of free ubiquitin was also increased in cells expressing either wild type or mutant α-synuclein (Fig. 2C), as compared with vector-transformed cells. This result was confirmed using multiple anti-ubiquitin antibodies (data not shown).Wild Type and Mutant α-Synuclein Have Minimal Effects on the Proteasome Complex—We next sought to elucidate whether changes in short-lived protein degradation were possibly because of the fact that α-synuclein caused an alteration in individual proteasome activities, altered the amount of proteasome complex present in cells, or potentially altered the composition of the proteasome complexes. To address this we purified the 20 S proteasome from cells under normal growth conditions, and at day 4 stationary phase. The purified proteasome complex (1 μg) from each cell type and condition was then analyzed for chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, or post-glutamyl peptidase activities (Fig. 3, A–C). Cells expressing wild type and mutant α-synuclein exhibited a small but significant decrease in chymotrypsin-like activity, as compared with vector-transformed cells (Fig. 3A). No other proteolytic activity of the proteasome was significantly altered in cells expressing wild type or mutant α-synuclein (Fig. 3, B and C). These data suggest that the specific activity of the proteasome complex is not significantly impaired in cells expressing α-synuclein, but do not rule out the possibility that α-synuclein may decrease the amount of proteasome complexes present in cells. To address this we quantified the amount of proteasome (μg) present in 1 mg of cell lysate. Together, these data demonstrate that under normal growth conditions, as well as day 4 stationary phase, α-synuclein did not have any significant effect on the intracellular proteasome content (Fig. 3B). Lastly, we examined the composition of the 20 S proteasome in cells transformed with empty vector, wild type α-synuclein, and mutant α-synuclein. These studies revealed that both wild type and mutant α-synuclein decreased the incorporation of several proteasome-associated proteins (Fig. 4, A–D), as compared with cells transformed with empty vector. To provide a quantitative assessment of the changes in protein incorporation within proteasome complex, we quantified the expression of individual protein spots from multiple experiments (Fig. 4D). In these studies, we observed that in α-synuclein expressing cells, both elevations and decreases in multiple proteasome-associated proteins could be observed (Fig. 4D).Fig. 3Analysis of proteasome activities in purified proteasome complexes, and analysis of intracellular proteasome content, in cells expressing α-synuclein. The amount of chymotrypsin-like (A), trypsin-like (B), and post-glutamyl peptidase activity (C) was quantified using 1 μg of purified 20 S proteasome from empty vector, wild type α-synuclein (Syn), or mutant α-synuclein (A30P) under normal growth conditions (Day 1) or day 4 stationary phase (Day 4).

https://openalex.org/W2099128795,"This study attempted to elucidate the signaling mechanism underlying dopaminergic cell death in the MPP+ model for Parkinson's disease. In neuronal-differentiated PC12 cells, through the regulation by activated JNK and c-jun, BimEL expression was markedly increased in response to MPP+ treatment, which led to the cell degeneration. In lieu of Smac translocation as seen in other paradigms, up-regulation of BimEL effected an increase in calpain I activity that, in turn, mediated AIF release from the mitochondria. In support, we found that knocking down BimEL expression resulted in a decrease in calpain I activity, as well as AIF release from the mitochondria and cell death. Finally, inhibition of calpain activity mitigated AIF release from the mitochondria and cell death. Under cell-free conditions, activated purified calpain I could induce the release of AIF from isolated mitochondria without the participation of BimEL or activated JNK, suggesting that AIF release is a direct consequence of calpain I activity. In concert, the results suggest a novel signaling pathway for dopaminergic cell degeneration, in which MPP+ induces the up-regulation of BimEL, which in turn potentiates an elevation in calpain I activity that mediates AIF release and cell death in a caspase-independent manner."

Upon restimulation with antigen, such preactivated Th lymphocytes can reexpress the <i>il4</i> gene independent of IL-4 receptor signaling. This memory for expression of the <i>il4</i> gene depends on epigenetic modification of the <i>il4</i> gene locus and an increased expression of GATA-3, the key transcription factor for Th2 differentiation. Here, we have identified a phylogenetically conserved sequence, the conserved intronic regulatory element, in the first intron of the <i>il4</i> gene containing a tandem GATA-3 binding site. We show that GATA-3 binds to this sequence in a position- and orientation-dependent manner, <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. DNA demethylation and histone acetylation of this region occurs early and selectively in differentiating, IL-4-secreting Th2 lymphocytes. Deletion of the conserved element by replacement of the first exon and part of the first intron of the <i>il4</i> gene with <i>gfp</i> leads to a defect in the establishment of memory for expression of IL-4, in that reexpression of IL-4 still requires costimulation by exogenous IL-4. The conserved intronic regulatory element thus links the initial epigenetic modification of the <i>il4</i> gene to GATA-3 and serves as a genetic control element for memory expression of IL-4."
https://openalex.org/W1985636758,"CTCF is a transcription factor and a candidate tumor suppressor that contains a DNA-binding domain composed of 11 zinc fingers. We reported previously that CTCF is differentially regulated during differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of CTCF in myeloid cell differentiation. A human cell line, K562, that can be chemically induced to differentiate into various hematopoietic lineages was chosen as a model system for this study. Several K562 cell lines with constitutive and conditional expression of CTCF have been generated. By using these model systems we demonstrated that: (i) ectopic expression of CTCF in K562 cells led to growth retardation and promotion of differentiation into the erythroid lineage; (ii) CTCF knock-down significantly inhibited differentiation of K562 cells into erythroid lineage; (iii) differentiation of K562 into the megakaryocytic lineage was not significantly affected; and (iv) down-regulation of MYC has been identified as one of the mechanisms by which CTCF promotes erythroid differentiation. Taken together our results demonstrate that CTCF is involved in the control of myeloid cell growth and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2048982233,"Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is a rate-limiting enzyme required for the de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides from IMP. VX-944 (Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA) is a small-molecule, selective, noncompetitive inhibitor directed against human IMPDH. In this report, we show that VX-944 inhibits in vitro growth of human multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines via induction of apoptosis. Interleukin-6, insulin-like growth factor-1, or co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) do not protect against VX-944-induced MM cell growth inhibition. VX-944 induced apoptosis in MM cell lines with only modest activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9. Furthermore, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit VX-944-induced apoptosis and cell death. During VX-944-induced apoptosis, expressions of Bax and Bak were enhanced, and both apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (Endo G) were released from the mitochondria to cytosol, suggesting that VX-944 triggers apoptosis in MM cells primarily via a caspase-independent, Bax/AIF/Endo G pathway. Importantly, VX-944 augments the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and melphalan even in the presence of BMSCs. Taken together, our data demonstrate a primarily non-caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway triggered by VX-944, thereby providing a rationale to enhance MM cell cytotoxicity by combining this agent with conventional agents which trigger caspase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2072865302,"The production of inositol polyphosphate (IPs) and pyrophosphates (PP-IPs) from inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (I(1,4,5)P3) requires the 6-/3-/5-kinase activity of Ipk2 (also known as Arg82 and inositol polyphosphate multikinase). Here, we probed the distinct roles for I(1,4,5)P3 6- versus 3-kinase activities in IP metabolism and cellular functions reported for Ipk2. Expression of either I(1,4,5)P3 6- or 3-kinase activity rescued growth of ipk2-deficient yeast at high temperatures, whereas only 6-kinase activity enabled growth on ornithine as the sole nitrogen source. Analysis of IP metabolism revealed that the 3-kinase initiated the synthesis of novel pathway consisting of over eleven IPs and PP-IPs. This pathway was present in wild-type and ipk2 null cells, albeit at low levels as compared with inositol hexakisphosphate synthesis. The primary route of synthesis was: I(1,4,5)P3 → I(1,3,4,5)P4 → I(1,2,3,4,5)P5 → PP-IP4 → PP2-IP3 and required Kcs1 (or possibly Ipk2), Ipk1, a novel inositol pyrophosphate synthase, and then Kcs1 again, respectively. Mutation of kcs1 ablated this pathway in ipk2 null cells and overexpression of Kcs1 in ipk2 mutant cells phenocopied IP3K expression, confirming it harbors a novel 3-kinase activity.

High Performance Liquid Chromatography Columns and Gradients—Two different Partisphere SAX columns and elution gradients were used in this study. Method 1 utilized a custom-made narrow-bore column and was obtained from Capital HPLC Ltd. (12.5 cm × 2.1 mm). IPs were eluted with a linear gradient of ammonium phosphate (pH 3.5) (AP) from 10 mm to 1.7 m over the course of 12 min and isocratic elution at 1.7 m AP for 23 min (flow rate of 0.4 ml/min). Method 2 achieved higher resolution IPs by using a wider-bore Whatman column (12.5 cm × 4.6 mm) and a longer elution gradient as follows: a linear gradient from 10 to 85 mm AP over 5 min, then 85 mm to 1.7 m AP over 65 min, and then isocratic elution at 1.7 m AP for 30 min all at a flow rate of 1 ml/min.

The plasmids were then transformed into different yeast strains using standard yeast transformation techniques. The pCR®2.1 vector (Invitrogen) containing the entire scIpk1 coding region with a PCR-generated SalI site at the 5′ end was provided by Dr. Makoto Fujii (York laboratory, Duke University). The scIpk1 coding region was subcloned from pCR®2.1 using SalI and EcoRI and ligated into the pGEX-2T vector. The vector was transformed into Escherichia coli (DH5α) for expression of recombinant protein. In Vivo Labeling of Yeast Cultures—Yeast cultures were incubated at 30 °C in minimal medium lacking the appropriate amino acids and 150 μm CuSO4 to late logarithmic phase. [3H]Inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) was added to a final concentration of 80 μCi/ml. For pulse-chase analysis: yeast strains were grown to late logarithmic phase in 50 ml of unlabeled CM medium. The cells were washed and resuspended in 500 μl of inositol-free CM medium supplemented with 1 mCi/ml [3H]inositol. After labeling for 10 min the cells were washed, resuspended in 50 ml of inositol-replete CM medium without label, and incubated at 30 °C. Aliquots were taken at various time points, and the cells were frozen on dry ice until they could be harvested and analyzed by Partisphere strong-anion exchange HPLC. Soluble IPs were harvested and analyzed by HPLC using a strong-anion exchange column as described previously (8York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the IPs were harvested for enzyme treatment as described below. Enzyme Analysis of [3H]Inositol-labeled Yeast Extracts—Labeled yeast strains were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and lysed for 30 s with a bead beater (Biospec Products) using glass beads (B. Braun Biotech International). The lysate was immediately boiled for 5 min, and then the entire procedure was repeated a second time. Extracts containing soluble IPs were recovered by centrifugation. Reactions were carried out by incubating the extracts for 1 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mm NaCl with 500 ng of human Type I 5-phosphatase and/or human diphosphoryl inositol polyphosphate phosphohydrolase (DIPP). The reactions were stopped by addition of 200 μl of 10 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5, and analyzed by Partisphere strong-anion exchange HPLC. Bacterial Expression of dmIP3 and scIpk1—Transformed E. coli (DH5α) were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6 and induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d -galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C.Thecells were recovered by centrifugation at 4 °C, resuspended in ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, Complete Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed with four passes through a cell cracker (a high shear fluid processing system for cell rupture, Microfluidics Corp.). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were purified over glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm glutathione was used to elute the proteins from the glutathione Sepharose. Proteins were quantified by modified Bradford method and SDS-PAGE analysis. Inositol Phosphate Kinase Assay—All unlabeled IPs were purchased from Cell Signals, Inc., and [3H]I(1,3,4,5)P4 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [32P]I(1,3,4,5)P4 was synthesized in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μm I(1,4,5)P3, trace amounts of [32P]ATP, and 7.5 μg of dmIP3K. [3H]I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 standard was synthesized by incubating [3H]I(1,3,4,5)P4 with recombinant dmIpk2 and ATP as described (21Seeds A.M. Sandquist J.C. Spana E.P. York J.D. J. Biol.

Kinetic Assays—The Km and Vmax values of the enzymatic interaction between scIpk1 and I(1,3,4,5)P4 and various substrates were determined. The following reaction mixture was prepared: 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 4 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, 10,000 cpm/μl [32P]I(1,3,4,5)P4, 500 ng of scIpk1, and various concentrations of unlabeled I(1,3,4,5)P4 in a 20-μl reaction volume. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 μl of 1 m KH2PO4. The amount of product formed was quantified by thin layer chromatography. The Km and Vmax values were obtained from a nonlinear curve fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism version 4.01. Comparative roles of I(1,4,5)P3 6- and 3-Kinase Activities in Yeast—Studies of yeast Ipk2 have shown that its predominant in vivo catalytic function is to convert I(1,4,5)P3 → I(1,4,5,6)P4 → I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 via 6- and 3-kinase activities. Recombinant yeast Ipk2 has been shown biochemically, but not in vivo, to possess a less efficient I(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity.

To further probe the kinase-dependent roles for Ipk2, we compared I(1,4,5)P3 6- versus 3-kinase activities for functional complementation. To accomplish this, we genetically added back I(1,4,5,6)P4 or I(1,3,4,5)P4 production by heterologously expressing Drosophila IPKs, either dmIpk2 or dmIP3K, in ipk2-deficient yeast. Both kinases have been shown to be members of a family of IP kinases bearing a signature PXXXDXKXG motif that includes the following: Ipk2 6-/3-/5-kinases; IP6 kinases, which function as inositol pyrophosphate synthases and utilize IP5 and IP6 substrates; and IP3Ks, which were not found in budding yeast or plants, but were present in fly, mouse, and human genomes (4Irvine R.V. Schell M.J. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 17York J.D. Inositol Polyphosphate Regulation of Nuclear Function. 2. Academic Press, New York2003: 229-232Google Scholar). We recently reported the cloning and biochemical characterization of dmIP3K and dmIpk2 and showed they possess I(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase and I(1,4,5)P3 6-kinase activities, respectively (21Seeds A.M. Sandquist J.C. Spana E.P. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47222-47232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of ipk2-deficient cells that expressed either dmIpk2 or dmIP3K revealed that 6-kinase, but not 3-kinase activity could rescue growth on ornithine as a sole nitrogen source (Fig. 1A). This data, coupled with our previous analysis of the ipk2–3 mutant (5Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 287: 2026-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), indicated that production of I(1,4,5,6)P4, but not I(1,3,4,5)P4, was necessary for activation of the ArgR-Mcm1 transcriptional complex. When we analyzed the transgenic strains for growth at high temperatures, we found that either 6- or 3-kinase activity was able to complement the temperature-sensitive phenotype of ipk2 null yeast (Fig. 1B). To rule out that complementation analysis may be related to downstream metabolites, such as those required for mRNA export pathways as described for Ipk1 (8York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), we tested the expression in ipk2 ipk1 double mutant cells. Rescue of growth on ornithine as the sole nitrogen source or temperature sensitivity by dmIpk2 did not require the presence of Ipk1; however, the rescue of temperature sensitivity by dmIP3K did require Ipk1 (Fig. 1, A and B). Additionally, to determine if 6- or 3-kinase complementation of temperature sensitivity required pyrophosphate synthesis, we analyzed ipk2 kcs1 double mutants. We report that dmIpk2 and IP3K were able to partially (not fully) rescue under these conditions (Fig. 1B). Our data indicate that I(1,2,3,4,5)P5 production and a downstream PP-IP were required for sustaining temperature-sensitive complementation. Of interest, the ipk1-dependent temperature-sensitive phenotype may be of use for forward genetic strategies aimed at identification of regulators and receptors of Ipk1 pathways. Of note, we have previously published that ipk1 mutation is not temperature-sensitive by plating assays (only after 20 generations; see York et al. (8York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar)). Discovery of a Novel IP Metabolic Pathway Initiated by I(1,4,5)P3 3-Kinase Activity—We next analyzed the effect of heterologous expression of dmIpk2 and dmIP3K on IP metabolism in ipk2 null yeast. We previously reported that dmIpk2 expression was able to fully complement Ipk2 enzyme function in cells by converting I(1,4,5)P3 to I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 (21Seeds A.M. Sandquist J.C. Spana E.P. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47222-47232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Remarkably, analysis of ipk2-deficient cells expressing dmIP3K revealed the synthesis of several new IP metabolites, including novel IP3, IP4, IP5, and PP-IP species (Fig. 2). To determine the genes required for synthesis of the new species downstream of I(1,3,4,5)P4, we examined the role of inositol pyrophosphate synthase and 2-kinase activities. Kcs1 has been shown to synthesize PP-IP4α and PP-IP5α from I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and IP6 precursors (14Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24686-24692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A.M. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Of note, we have implemented a symbol-based nomenclature (α, β, and γ) to enable the distinction of the growing list of PP-IP isomers and species. As we describe below, the basis for assigning distinct isomers was that they had unique HPLC elution profiles and unique genetic routes of synthesis. At this time we do not have chemical structures that enable definition of the ring positions harboring pyrophosphates. Loss of Kcs1 in ipk2Δ cells expressing dmIP3K resulted in the obvious elimination of the most polar PP-IP species detected, PP2-IP3β (Fig. 2). We used the “β” designation due to its distinct elution profile from PP2-IP3α (which is synthesized downstream of I(1,3,4,5,6)P5 → PP-IP4α) and the fact that it is synthesized through I(1,3,4,5)P4 → I(1,2,3,4,5)P5 → PP-IP4β (also see below). These data indicate the existence of a second pyrophosphate synthase gene product, designated here as Ips1, required for the synthesis of PP-IP4β. It is unclear at this point whether or not Ips1 is similar or identical to the activity identified previously as Ids1, which is required for the synthesis of PP-IP5β (10York S.J. Armbruster B.N. Greenwell P. Petes T.D. York J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4264-4269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We next tested whether yeast Ipk1 was required for the pathway. When dmIP3K was expressed in ipk2Δipk1Δ cells, there was a loss of IP5 and all PP-IPs, along with the accumulation of unique IP3 and IP4 species (Fig. 2). We therefore conclude that phosphorylation of I(1,4,5)P3 on the D-3 position initiates a novel IP synthesis pathway that requires Ipk1, a novel inositol pyrophosphate synthase, and Kcs1. Does this novel pathway exist in wild-type or ipk2 mutant cells? Earlier work by our laboratory and the Shears laboratory indicated that IPs with similar HPLC elution profiles to those we observed in Fig. 2 exist at low levels in ipk2-deficient and wild-type cells (8York J.D. Odom A.R. Murphy R. Ives E.B. Wente S.R. Science. 1999; 285: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar, 18Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We therefore re-examined several combinations of kinase mutants using a high resolution and high sensitivity radiolabeling system (Fig. 3). Using this method, examination of ipk2 null cells revealed a similar pattern of IPs to those observed in the dmIP3K-expressing cells (compare Fig. 3, top and second traces). Of note, this method also exposed that the number of unique IP and PP-IP species in ipk2-deficient cells expressing dmIP3K was substantially greater than we previously thought (compare Fig. 3, top trace to Fig. 2, second trace). The presence of these IPs in ipk2-deficient cells led us to speculate that another yeast gene product harbors I(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase activity. We therefore analyzed ipk2 ipk1 and ipk2 kcs1 double mutant cells (Fig. 3, bottom two traces). Similar to results shown above, loss of Ipk1 in ipk2 null cells resulted in the disappearance of IP5 and PP-IP species, and a corresponding accumulation of IP3 and IP4. Loss of Kcs1 in ipk2 null cells ablated the synthesis of nearly all IP and PP-IPs detectable using this high sensitivity method. This indicates that Kcs1 may regulate or act as a I(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase and that Ipk1 functions in the conversion of IP4 to the higher IPs of this pathway. High sensitivity labeling of wild-type cells indicated similar species were present (data not shown) consistent with results of others (18Saiardi A. Caffrey J.J. Snyder S.H. Shears S.B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Ipk1 Harbors I(1,3,4,5)P4 2-Kinase Activity—Our data indicated that the dmIP3K-dependent IP synthesis pathway was initiated by D-3 phosphorylation of I(1,4,5)P3 to I(1,3,4,5)P4. Because deletion of Ipk1 blocked the pathway and caused a buildup of I(1,3,4,5)P4, we hypothesized that the second step was carried out by Ipk1 phosphorylation of I(1,3,4,5)P4 to generate I(1,2,3,4,5)P5. To test this, we carried out in vitro kinase assays using both recombinant dmIP3K and scIpk1 (Fig. 4). Incubation of I(1,4,5)P3 with ATP and dmIP3K resulted in the generation of IP4 that we previously demonstrated to be I(1,3,4,5)P4 (Fig. 4B) (21Seeds A.M. Sandquist J.C. Spana E.P. York J.D. J. Biol.

PINCH-1, a widely expressed protein consisting of five LIM domains and a C-terminal tail, is an essential focal adhesion protein with multiple functions including regulation of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) level, cell shape, and survival signaling. We show here that the LIM1-mediated interaction with ILK regulates all these three processes. By contrast, the LIM4-mediated interaction with Nck-2, which regulates cell morphology and migration, is not required for the control of the ILK level and survival. Remarkably, a short 15-residue tail C-terminal to LIM5 is required for both cell shape modulation and survival, albeit it is not required for the control of the ILK level. The C-terminal tail not only regulates PINCH-1 localization to focal adhesions but also functions after it localizes there. These findings suggest that PINCH-1 functions as a molecular platform for coupling and uncoupling diverse cellular processes via overlapping but yet distinct domain interactions.

Cells in which the expression of PINCH-1 or ILK is suppressed exhibit similar defects in cell spreading and survival (9Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 30Troussard A.A. Mawji N.M. Ong C. Mui A. St-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. J. Biol.

Remarkably, depletion of PINCH-1 from mammalian cells resulted in marked down-regulation of the protein level but not the mRNA level of ILK (9Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These results suggest that PINCH-1 functions at least in part by controlling the cellular level of ILK. Meanwhile, they have raised several new questions. First, does PINCH-1 function in the control of the ILK protein level via its interaction with ILK? Although the current model favors a positive answer to this question, it is important to unequivocally test this via experimentation. Second, because cell shape can influence cell survival and vice versa, is the cell survival defect induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 a simple reflection of its inhibition of cell spreading and vice versa? In other words, can the functions of PINCH-1 in cell spreading and survival be uncoupled (or separately regulated)? Third, are there PINCH sites besides the ILK binding LIM1 domain that are essential for PINCH-1-mediated cell shape modulation and survival? If there are, where are they located and do they regulate cell shape and survival via control of the level or localization of ILK? To address these questions we have used a structure-based genetic rescue approach to dissect the functions of PINCH-1. The results not only provide important information on the molecular basis of PINCH-1-mediated processes but also shed new light on the mechanism that controls the coupling and uncoupling of diverse processes such as shape modulation and survival. Antibodies and Other Reagents—Rabbit antibodies against AKT, phospho-Akt (Ser-473), and phospho-Akt(Thr-308) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-paxillin antibody (clone 349) was from BD Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Mouse monoclonal anti-ILK antibody (clone 65.1) and rabbit anti-PINCH-1 polyclonal antibodies were previously described (20Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J.

Rhodamine RedTX-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch laboratories (West Grove, PA). Insulin-like growth factor 1, fetal bovine serum, and cell culture media were from Invitrogen. PINCH-1 siRNA and DNA Constructs—The sequence of the PINCH-1-specific siRNA was previously described (9Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The 21-nucleotide synthetic siRNA duplex was prepared by Dharmacon Research. For rescue experiments we generated PINCH-1 expression vectors encoding transcripts that are resistant to the PINCH-1 siRNA. To do this we introduced silent mutations into the siRNA-targeted site (5′-AAGGTGATGTGGTCTCTGCTC-3′, in which the underlined T and G were replaced with C) in the PINCH-1 cDNA sequence using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). The sequence of the resulting “siRNA resistant” PINCH-1 cDNA, which encodes a protein sequence that is identical to that of wild type PINCH-1, was confirmed by automated DNA sequence. The Q40A and R197A/R198A point mutations were introduced into the siRNA-resistant PINCH-1 expression vector using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). The LIM5 deletion mutation, the C-terminal tail deletion mutation, and the PINCH-1/PINCH-2 C-terminal tail swap mutation were generated by PCR using the siRNA-resistant PINCH-1 cDNA (and PINCH-2 cDNA for the swap mutation) as templates. The mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequence. DNA and siRNA Transfection—HeLa cells were transfected with the siRNA resistant expression vectors encoding the wild type or mutant forms of PINCH-1 as specified in each experiment using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen). Two days after DNA transfection, the cells were transfected with the PINCH-1 siRNA or an irrelevant 21-nucleotide synthetic RNA duplex as a control using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) as previously described (9Fukuda T.

The percentage of cells adopting spread morphology was quantified by analyzing at least 300 cells from four randomly selected fields (>80 cells/field). Apoptosis—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Apoptosis was analyzed 48 h after siRNA transfection using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) and caspase-3 assays as previously described (34Zhang Y. Chen K. Tu Y. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41695-41705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The TUNEL assay was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). The caspase-3 activities were measured using fluorogenic caspase-3 substrate VII (Ac-DEVD-aminofluoromethylcoumarin) from Calbiochem following the manufacturer's protocol. GFP-PINCH-1 Expression and Immunofluorescent Staining—Expression vectors encoding GFP-tagged wild type and mutant forms of PINCH-1 were generated by inserting the corresponding PINCH-1 cDNA sequences into the pEGFP-C2 vector (Clontech). HeLa cells were transfected with the GFP-PINCH-1 expression vectors using Lipofectamine PLUS (Invitrogen). The transiently transfected cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips 1 day after DNA transfection. After incubation overnight at 37 °C under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere, the cells were fixed and stained with mouse primary antibodies against ILK (clone 65.1) or paxillin (clone 349). Mouse monoclonal antibodies were detected with Rhodamine RedTX-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies. PINCH-1 Functions in the Maintenance of the ILK Protein Level via Its Interaction with ILK—Consistent with the previous studies (9Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), suppression of PINCH-1 expression in HeLa cells (Fig. 1A, compare lane 2 with lane 1) significantly reduced the protein level of ILK (Fig. 1C, compare lane 2 with lane 1). To test whether PINCH-1 functions in the maintenance of the ILK protein level via binding to ILK, we expressed the wild type PINCH-1 (Fig. 1A, lane 4) and an ILK binding-defective PINCH-1 mutant in which Gln-40 located at the ILK binding interface was replaced with alanine (Fig. 1A, lane 3) in PINCH-1 knockdown cells. The Q40A mutation ablates the ILK binding but does not alter the overall structure of LIM1 (21Velyvis A. Yang Y. Wu C. Qin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4932-4939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 24Zhang Y. Chen K. Tu Y. Velyvis A. Yang Y. Qin J. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4777-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Western blotting analyses showed that expression of the wild type PINCH-1 but not that of the ILK binding-defective point mutant restored the level of ILK (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 4). In parallel experiments, an equal amount of actin was detected in all cell lysates (Fig. 1B). These results confirm the specificity of the ILK down-regulation induced by the PINCH-1 siRNA. Furthermore, they demonstrate that PINCH-1 functions in the maintenance of the ILK level through its interaction with ILK. Expression of the Wild Type PINCH-1, but Not the ILK Binding-defective Point Mutant, in PINCH-1 Knockdown Cells Rescues the Defects in Cell Spreading and Survival—We next sought to identify the PINCH sites that are involved in the regulation of cell spreading and survival signaling. To this end, we first compared the effects of the wild type PINCH-1 and the ILK binding-defective point mutant on cell spreading. Unlike cells expressing a normal level of PINCH-1 (Fig. 1, D and H), PINCH-1 knockdown cells exhibited impaired ability to spread (Fig. 1, E and H). Re-expression of the wild type PINCH-1 (Fig. 1, G and H) but not that of the ILK binding-defective point mutant (Fig. 1, F and H) significantly improved the ability of cells to spread in response to cell-ECM adhesion. These results indicate that the interaction with ILK is essential for PINCH-1-mediated cell spreading. To assess the significance of the ILK binding in cell survival signaling, we analyzed the activating phosphorylation of Akt, a key signaling intermediate that protects cells from apoptosis (35Hemmings B.A. Science. 1997; 275: 628-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 36Franke T.F.

Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), knockdown of PINCH-1 (Fig. 2D, lanes 9 and 10) markedly inhibited the insulin-like growth factor 1-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 (Fig. 2A, compare lane 10 with lane 2) and Thr-308 (Fig. 2B, compare lane 10 with lane 2). Knockdown of PINCH-1 also inhibited the Ser-473 and Thr-308 phosphorylation of Akt in cells culturing in normal serum-containing medium (see Fig. 4). Transient expression of the wild type PINCH-1 (Fig. 2D, lanes 7 and 8), but not that of the ILK binding-defective Q40A point mutant (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4), restored to a considerable extent the phosphorylation of Akt (Figs. 2, A and B, lanes 4 and 8), underscoring the importance of the ILK binding in the activating phosphorylation of Akt.Fig. 4The PINCH-1 C-terminal tail regulates Akt phosphorylation. HeLa cells were transfected with the control DNA vector lacking PINCH-1 sequence and an irrelevant 21-nucleotide RNA duplex (lane 1), the control DNA vector lacking PINCH-1 sequence and the PINCH-1 siRNA (lane 2), the siRNA-resistant expression vector encoding the wild type PINCH-1 and the PINCH-1 siRNA (lane 3), the siRNA-resistant expression vector encoding the LIM5 deletion mutant (residues 1–249) and the PINCH-1 siRNA (lane 4), the siRNA-resistant expression vector encoding the C-terminal tail deletion mutant (residues 1–310) and the PINCH-1 siRNA (lane 5), and the siRNA-resistant expression vector encoding the C-terminal tail swap mutant (lane 6). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for 48 h after siRNA transfection and then analyzed by Western blotting (10 μg/lane) with antibodies recognizing PINCH-1 (A), actin (B), ILK (C), phospho (-P)-Akt (Ser-473) (D), phospho-Akt (Thr-308) (E), and Akt (F), respectively. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further analyze this, we measured the activity of caspase-3, a key mediator of apoptosis, in PINCH-1 knockdown cells as well as in cells that re-express the wild type or the ILK binding-defective point mutant of PINCH-1. As expected, the level of caspase-3 activity was elevated in PINCH-1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3A, Vector/PINCH-1(–)). Transient expression of the wild type PINCH-1 (Fig. 3A, WT/PINCH-1(–)) but not that of the ILK binding-defective Q40A point mutant (Fig. 3A, Q40A/PINCH-1(–)) significantly reduced the caspase-3 activity. Consistent with this, the percentage of apoptotic cells measured by TUNEL was significantly increased in the PINCH-1 knockdown cells (Fig. 3B). Transient expression of the wild type PINCH-1 but not that of the ILK binding-defective Q40A point mutant in the PINCH-1 knockdown cells significantly reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the interaction of PINCH-1 with ILK is crucial for protection of cells from apoptosis. The Nck-2 Binding Is Dispensable for PINCH-1-mediated Cell Survival Signaling—In addition to interacting with ILK through the N-terminal-most LIM1 domain, PINCH-1 interacts with Nck-2, an SH2/SH3-containing adaptor protein, via its C-terminal LIM4 domain (25Tu Y. Li F. Wu C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3367-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Velyvis A. Vaynberg J. Yang Y. Vinogradova O. Zhang Y. Wu C. Qin J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It is increasingly clear that the interaction between PINCH-1 and Nck-2 is involved in regulation of actin cytoskeleton remodeling (25Tu Y. Li F. Wu C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3367-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 26Velyvis A. Vaynberg J. Yang Y. Vinogradova O. Zhang Y. Wu C. Qin J. Nat. Struct.

Cell. 2005; 17: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It has not been determined, however, whether or not the binding of PINCH-1 to Nck-2 plays a role in PINCH-1-mediated cell survival signaling. To test this we expressed a Nck-2 binding-defective PINCH-1 mutant (RRAA) in which Arg-197—Arg-198, located at the Nck-2 binding interface (26Velyvis A. Vaynberg J. Yang Y. Vinogradova O. Zhang Y. Wu C. Qin J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), were replaced with alanine residues in PINCH-1 knockdown cells (Fig. 2D, lanes 5 and 6). The R197A/R198A mutations ablate the Nck-2 binding but do not alter the overall structure of the LIM4 domain (26Velyvis A. Vaynberg J. Yang Y. Vinogradova O. Zhang Y. Wu C. Qin J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 39Vaynberg J. Fukuda T. Chen K. Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Tu Y. Ng I. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Transient expression of the Nck-2 binding-defective mutant (Figs. 2, A and B, lane 6), like that of the wild type PINCH-1 (Figs. 2, A and B, lane 8), significantly enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, it substantially reduced the activity of caspase-3 that was induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 (to a level that was comparable with what was seen in cells transiently expressing the wild type PINCH-1) (Fig. 3A, RRAA/PINCH-1(–)). TUNEL analyses confirmed that the Nck-2 binding-defective mutant effectively rescued the survival defect induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the interaction of PINCH-1 with Nck-2, unlike that with ILK, is dispensable for cell survival signaling. The PINCH-1 C-terminal Region Is Crucial for Survival Signaling and Cell Spreading but Not Maintenance of the ILK Level—We next expressed a PINCH-1 mutant (ΔLIM5) in which the C-terminal LIM5 and non-LIM tail were deleted in PINCH-1 knockdown cells. The wild type PINCH-1 was expressed in PINCH-1 knockdown cells as a positive control. The expression of ΔLIM5 (Fig. 4A, lane 4) and the wide type PINCH-1(Fig. 4A, lane 3) in the PINCH-1 knockdown cells (Fig. 4A, lane 2) was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-PINCH-1 antibody. Probing the cells with antibodies specific for phospho-Akt (Ser-473) or phospho-Akt (Thr-308) showed that the level of Ser-473- and Thr-308-phospho-Akt, as expected, was significantly reduced in PINCH-1 knockdown cells (Figs. 4, D and E, compare lane 2 with lane 1). Whereas expression of the wild type PINCH-1 restored the level of phospho-Akt near what was found in the control cells (Figs. 4, D and E, compare lane 3 with lane 1), expression of ΔLIM5 failed to rescue the defect in Akt phosphorylation (Figs. 4, D and E, compare lane 4 with lane 2). In control experiments neither the total Akt protein level (Fig. 4F, lanes 1–4) nor the actin level (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–4) was altered, confirming the specificity of the rescue experiments. Consistent with the defect in Akt phosphorylation, expression of ΔLIM5 failed to inhibit the activation of caspase-3 induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that the C-terminal region of PINCH-1, like the N-terminal LIM1, is required for cell survival signaling. Importantly, although ΔLIM5 failed to rescue the defect in survival signaling, expression of ΔLIM5, like that of the wild type PINCH-1, restored the level of ILK protein (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4). To further analyze this we expressed a PINCH-1 mutant containing all five LIM domains but lacking the C-terminalmost non-LIM tail in PINCH-1-deficient cells (Fig. 4A, lane 5). The expression of the C-terminal-most tail deletion mutant (CD) restored the level of ILK protein (Fig. 4C, lane 5) but not that of Akt phosphorylation (Figs. 4, D and E, lanes 5). Consistent with this, expression of the CD mutant failed to significantly reduce the activation of caspase-3 (Fig. 3C) and the percentage of the TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells (Fig. 3D) induced by the depletion of PINCH-1. We next assessed the role of the C-terminal region in cell spreading. The results showed that expression of ΔLIM5 (Fig. 5, D and G) or CD (Fig. 5, E and G), unlike that of the wild type PINCH-1 (Fig. 5, C and G), failed to rescue the cell-spreading defect induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 (Fig. 5, B and G). Thus, despite their ability to restore ILK protein level, neither ΔLIM5 nor CD was able to rescue the defect in cell shape modulation induced by the depletion of PINCH-1. This result together with those described earlier suggests that PINCH-1 not only functions in the control of the ILK level (which is mediated by its interaction with ILK) but also is directly involved in the cell shape modulation and survival signaling (which requires both the N-terminal LIM1 domain and the C-terminal region). The C-terminal-most Tail Not Only Regulates PINCH-1 Localization to Cell-ECM Adhesions but Also Is Required for PINCH-1 Functions at Cell-ECM Adhesions—Proper subcellular localization is critical for normal protein functions. Thus, the failure of the PINCH-1 C-terminal-most tail deletion mutant to rescue cell survival and spreading defects could result from its deficiency in focal adhesion localization. To compare the ability to localize to cell-ECM adhesions, we expressed GFP-tagged wild type PINCH-1 (Fig. 6B, lane 2) and the CD mutant (Fig. 6B, lane 3) in HeLa cells and plated them on fibronectin-coated surface. Immunofluorescent staining of the cells with a monoclonal anti-ILK antibody showed that, as expected, GFP-PINCH-1 was readily co-clustered with ILK in cell-ECM adhesions (Fig. 6, C and D). By contrast, the ability of the C-terminal tail deletion mutant to localize to cell-ECM adhesions was compromised (Fig. 6, E and F). The reduced efficiency of the C-terminal tail deletion mutant to localize to cell-ECM adhesions was not caused by a general deficiency of cell-ECM adhesions, as abundant cell-ECM adhesions were detected in these cells (Fig. 6F). Similar results were obtained by immunofluorescent staining of the cells with a monoclonal antibody to paxillin, another marker of cell-ECM adhesions (data not shown). These results suggest that the C-terminal non-LIM tail plays an important role in the regulation of PINCH-1 localization to cell-ECM adhesions. To test whether the C-terminal non-LIM tail is merely involved in the regulation of cell-ECM adhesion localization or it is also required for the functions of PINCH-1 after its arrival at cell-ECM adhesions, we replaced the PINCH-1 C-terminal non-LIM tail with that of PINCH-2 (40Zhang Y. Chen K. Guo L. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38328-38338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 41Braun A. Bordoy R. Stanchi F. Moser M. Kostka G.G. Ehler E. Brandau O. Fassler R. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 284: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6A). HeLa cells were transfected with the expression vector encoding the GFP-tagged C-terminal tail swap mutant (CS). The expression of GFP-CS was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 6B, lane 4). Immunofluorescent analyses showed that GFP-CS (Fig. 6G), like the wild type PINCH-1, readily localized to cell-ECM adhesions where abundant ILK (Fig. 6H) and paxillin (not shown) were detected. To test whether the C-terminal tail-swap mutant could functionally substitute PINCH-1 in cell survival signaling and shape modulation, we expressed it in PINCH-1 knockdown cells (Fig. 4A, lane 6). Expression of the CS mutant, as expected, effectively relieved the suppression of the ILK level induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 (Fig. 4C, compare lane 6 with lane 2). However, despite its ability to restore the ILK level and to localize to cell-ECM adhesions, the CS mutant failed to rescue the defect in Akt phosphorylation induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 (Figs. 4, D and E, lane 6). Consistent with this, the caspase-3 activity level remained elevated (Fig. 3C), and the percentage of apoptotic (TUNEL positive) cells was not significantly reduced (Fig. 3D) after the expression of the CS mutant in the PINCH-1 knockdown HeLa cells. Comparison of cell spreading showed that the CS mutant, like the CD mutant, failed to rescue the cell spreading defect induced by the depletion of PINCH-1 in HeLa cells (Fig. 5, F and G). These results suggest that the PINCH-1 C-terminalmost tail functions not only in the efficient localization of PINCH-1 to cell-ECM adhesions but also in cell shape modulation and survival signaling after PINCH-1 localizes to the adhesion sites. One of the key questions in molecular cell biology is how cells couple and uncouple diverse cellular processes such as shape modulation and survival. PINCH-1 is a widely expressed focal adhesion adaptor that is required for multiple processes including regulation of the ILK level, modulation of cell shape, and transduction of survival signals (9Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Liang X. Zhou Q. Li X. Sun Y. Lu M. Dalton N. Ross Jr., J. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using a structure-based reverse genetic rescue approach, we have molecularly dissected the functions of PINCH-1. The results reveal a mechanism in which PINCH-1, through its interactions with distinct binding partners, serves as a molecular platform for coupling and uncoupling diverse cellular processes via distinct domain-domain interactions. By expression of an ILK binding-defective PINCH-1 point mutant (Q40A) in PINCH-1 knockdown cells, we have demonstrated that PINCH-1 function in the maintenance of the ILK protein level through its interaction with ILK. This result together with our previous finding that down-regulation of the ILK level is mediated at least in part by proteasome-mediated protein degradation (9Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) suggests that the binding of PINCH to the ankyrin domain of ILK probably helps to stabilize ILK and, hence, prevents its degradation. This may provide an explanation as to why the formation of the PINCH-1-ILK complex occurs early and precedes their localization to cell-ECM adhesions (24Zhang Y. Chen K. Tu Y. Velyvis A. Yang Y. Qin J. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4777-4786Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Elevation of ILK levels is closely associated with and probably is an important causal factor for the progression of several human diseases including cancers and renal failure (for review, see Refs. 2Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 4Wu C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1692: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 16Persad S.

The importance of the PINCH-1 binding to the maintenance of the ILK level suggests that it could serve as a useful target for the therapeutic control of the ILK protein level and, hence, the progression of human diseases involving abnormal expression of ILK. A second important finding of the current study is that the cell spreading defect induced by the loss of PINCH-1 can be uncoupled from the survival defect induced by the loss of PINCH-1 and vice versa. PINCH-1 is required for both cell shape modulation and survival signaling (9Fukuda T. Chen K. Shi X. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51324-51333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 13Liang X. Zhou Q. Li X. Sun Y. Lu M. Dalton N. Ross Jr., J. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3056-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We previously found that the interaction of PINCH-1 with Nck-2 functions in actin cytoskeletal regulation (39Vaynberg J. Fukuda T. Chen K. Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Tu Y. Ng I. Wu C. Qin J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 513-523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The data presented in this paper demonstrate that the interaction with Nck-2 is not required for cell survival (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, although PINCH-1 is intimately involved in the regulation of both the actin cytoskeleton and survival signaling, they can be uncoupled from each other. Based on these results, it is attractive to propose a model in which cells can either coordinately or separately regulate the morphological change and survival. Down-regulation of the interaction of PINCH-1 with ILK inhibits cell spreading as well as survival signaling, resulting in coordinated regulation of these two processes. On the other hand, down-regulation of the interaction of PINCH-1 with Nck-2 inhibits cell spreading and migration but not survival and, hence, the uncoupling of these two processes. The ability of PINCH-1 to either coordinately or separately regulate morphological change and survival through interactions mediated by distinct sites provides a versatile system for cells to control these processes. The studies presented in this paper have identified a new site that is crucial for PINCH-1 function. By expression of a PINCH-1 mutant in which the short C-terminal tail is deleted in PINCH-1 knockdown cells, we have shown that it is indispensable for PINCH-1-mediated regulation of cell spreading and survival signaling. The functions of the C-terminal tail are 2-fold. It facilitates PINCH-1 localization to cell-ECM adhesions. Although there is no doubt that this is important for the functions of PINCH-1, the C-terminal tail apparently is also required after PINCH-1 localizes to cell-ECM adhesions, as replacing it with a sequence derived from the C terminus of PINCH-2 restores the PINCH-1 localization to cell-ECM adhesion but not its functions in cell spreading and survival signaling. The identification of the C-terminal tail as a key site that regulates both the localization and the post-localization signaling of PINCH-1 should facilitate future studies aimed at identifying additional PINCH-1 binding partners involved in these processes. Although the PINCH-1 C-terminal tail participates in cell shape modulation and survival signaling, it is not required for the maintenance of the ILK protein level. Thus, among the three PINCH-1 functional sites (LIM1, LIM4, and the C-terminal tail), only LIM1 is involved in the maintenance of the ILK level. Cell survival signaling involves at least two sites (i.e. LIM1 and the C-terminal tail). PINCH-1-mediated modulation of cell morphological change appears to be most demanding among the three PINCH-1-mediated processes. It requires all three PINCH-1 functional sites. The studies described in this paper have firmly established the functional importance and specificity of each of these three sites. Recent studies have demonstrated that Ras suppressor 1 (RSU-1) interacts with the C-terminal region of PINCH-1 (11Kadrmas J.L. Smith M.A. Clark K.A. Pronovost S.M. Muster N. Yates J.R.R.

Pronovost S.M. Muster N. Yates J.R.R. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1019-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Dougherty et al. (12Dougherty G.W. Chopp T. Qi S. Cutler M.L. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 306: 168-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have shown that PINCH-2 does not interact with RSU-1. Bock-Marquette et al. (18Bock-Marquette I. Saxena A. White M.D. Michael DiMaio J. Srivastava D. Nature. 2004; 432: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) recently reported that PINCH-1 and ILK function as key regulators of cardiac cell migration, survival and repair. Furthermore, they have shown that PINCH-1, through its C-terminal region, interacts with thymosin β4 (18Bock-Marquette I. Saxena A. White M.D. Michael DiMaio J. Srivastava D. Nature. 2004; 432: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Although the specific thymosin β4-binding site within the PINCH-1 C-terminal region remains to be determined, PINCH-1 could function in cardiomyocytes by linking thymosin β4 with ILK and other binding partners through its distinct binding sites and, hence, promotes cardiac cell migration, survival, and consequently, cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (18Bock-Marquette I. Saxena A. White M.D. Michael DiMaio J. Srivastava D. Nature. 2004; 432: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Protein-protein interactions provide the foundation for control of cellular architecture and signal transduction (43Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). With the arrival of the post-genomics era, it has become increasingly clearly that a large number of key protein-protein interactions are mediated by a relatively small number of scaffolding proteins, which through its multiple protein-binding motifs, provide a hub or platform for protein interactions. The studies presented in this paper together with previous studies suggest that PINCH-1, through interactions mediated by LIM1, LIM4, the C-terminal tail, and perhaps other yet to be identified sites, functions as one of the key protein binding platforms at the cell-ECM adhesions controlling cell shape modulation and survival."

Similar to Mad – Mother Against Decapentaplegic-(Smad)4 is frequently altered in cancers, but its involvement in this system is unknown. We analysed 56 thyroid tumours of various histotypes for Smad4 mutations by PCR-SSCP and sequencing, linking them to Smad4 reactivity as examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC), and 29 of them also for abnormalities in RNA expression due to alternative splicing. In all, 15/56 cases (27%), both benign and malignant lesions, harbour alterations of Smad4 coding sequence. We found several novel intragenic mutations (13 missense, two silent, one frameshift and one large insertion-deletion), with high incidence in the linker region. A subset of mutated tumours failed to express Smad4 protein by IHC. We have also detected four alternatively spliced tumour-associated Smad4 isoforms, lacking portions of the linker region, and three more due to unreported internal exon–exon rearrangements. Smad4 is both frequently mutated and deregulated by aberrant splicing in thyroid tumours and these alterations may contribute as an early event to thyroid tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2034873621,"Nuclear gene(s) have been shown to modulate the phenotypic expression of mitochondrial DNA mutations. We report here the identification and characterization of the yeast nuclear gene MTO2 encoding an evolutionarily conserved protein involved in mitochondrial tRNA modification. Interestingly, mto2 null mutants expressed a respiratory-deficient phenotype when coexisting with the C1409G mutation of mitochondrial 15 S rRNA at the very conservative site for human deafness-associated 12 S rRNA A1491G and C1409T mutations. Furthermore, the overall rate of mitochondrial translation was markedly reduced in a yeast mto2 strain in the wild type mitochondrial background, whereas mitochondrial protein synthesis was almost abolished in a yeast mto2 strain carrying the C1409G allele. The other interesting feature of mto2 mutants is the defective expression of mitochondrial genes, especially CYTB and COX1, but only when coexisting with the C1409G allele. These data strongly indicate that a product of MTO2 functionally interacts with the decoding region of 15 S rRNA, particularly at the site of the C1409G or A1491G mutation. In addition, we showed that yeast and human Mto2p localize in mitochondria. The isolated human MTO2 cDNA can partially restore the respiratory-deficient phenotype of yeast mto2 cells carrying the C1409G mutation. These functional conservations imply that human MTO2 may act as a modifier gene, modulating the phenotypic expression of the deafness-associated A1491G or C1409T mutation in mitochondrial 12 S rRNA.

Interaction between the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes is necessary for controlling the phenotypic expression of mtDNA mutation(s). In humans, nuclear modifier gene(s) have been shown to modulate the phenotypic expression of the mitochondrial 12 S rRNA A1491G or C1409T mutation associated with aminoglycoside-induced and nonsyndromic deafness (1Guan M.X.

Our previous investigations revealed that the A1491G or C1409T mutation in human mtDNA is the primary contributor underlying the development of deafness but is not sufficient to produce a clinical phenotype (2Guan M.X.

An interesting model for nuclear-mtDNA interaction for the phenotypic expression of the A1491G or C1409T mutation has been proposed in S. cerevisiae. The mutant allele of MTO1 or MSS1, encoding mitochondrial proteins, manifests a respiratory-deficient phenotype only when coupled with the paromomycin-resistance mitochondrial 15 S rRNA C1409G mutation (PR454 or PR) (17Colby G.

These observations strongly indicate that Mss1p or Mto1p affects the phenotypic expression of the C1409G mutation by functionally interacting with the region of the C1409G mutation in mitochondrial 15 S rRNA. In E. coli, the products of mnmE (homolog of MSS1) (19Cabedo H. Macian F. Villarroya M. Escudero J.C. Martinez-Vicente M. Knecht E. Armengod M.E.

This modified nucleotide, found in the wobble position of several bacterial tRNAs specific for glutamate, lysine, arginine, and glutamine, has a pivotal role in the structure and function of tRNAs, including structural stabilization, aminoacylation, and codon recognition at the decoding site of small ribosomal RNAs (20Brégeon D.

Recently, we demonstrated that isolated human MTO1 or GTPBP3 (homolog of MSS1) cDNA can complement the respiratory-deficient phenotype of yeast mto1 or mss1 cells carrying the 15 S rRNA C1409G mutation, suggesting that the functions of those proteins are evolutionarily conserved (23Li X.

In S. cerevisiae, mto2/mtu1 (homolog of trmU) null mutants conferred defects in 2-thiouridylation in mitochondrial tRNALys, tRNAGlu, and tRNAGln but not cytoplasmic tRNALys (25Umeda N. Suzuki T.

To examine whether yeast MTO2 (mitochondrial translational optimization) mediates the phenotypic expression of the 15 S rRNA C1409G mutation, this nuclear gene has been identified, and a null mto2 mutation in the wild type mitochondrial background (paromomycin-sensitive PS) or C1409G (PR) allele has been generated. These mto2 null mutants have been characterized by examining mitochondrial gene expression, mitochondrial protein synthesis, and functional complementation of human MTO2 cDNA in a yeast mto2 mutant carrying the mitochondrial C1409G (PR) allele. Furthermore, the yeast and human Mto2p were examined for subcellular localization by immunofluorescence analysis.

This search led to the identification of one open reading frame encoding a protein (YDL033C, GenBank™ accession number Z71781) with a high degree of homology to E. coli TrmU. To obtain the full-length coding region of MTO2 DNA, PCR was performed using the high fidelity Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) and total yeast genomic DNA isolated from W303-1B cells as a template, with primers 5′-AATTTTAAGAGCGCCGGG-3′ (nucleotides (nt) 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide(s); GFP, green fluorescent protein; DIG, digoxigenin. 143-163) and 5′-ACATGATTCAAGGGAAAAGACC-3′ (nt 1713-1734) (GenBank™ accession number AY624369). The predominant PCR product was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequently cloned into a PCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Sequencing was done using a Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an ABI PRISM™ 3100 genetic analyzer. The resultant plasmid carrying the full-length coding region of yeast MTO2 was designed as pYMTO2. Construction of mto2 Null Mutants—mto2 null strains were generated by the one-step gene disruption technique of Rothstein (31Rothestein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 101: 202-211Crossref Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). A 1.6-kb HindIII/XbaI fragment containing the full-length coding region of the MTO2 gene was isolated by digesting pYMTO2 with HindIII and XbaI and was ligated to the vector pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega) to produce the resultant plasmid pGEM-MTO2. A 452-base-pair EcoRV fragment (positions 614-1066) spanning the coding region of MTO2 was deleted by digesting with EcoRV. The 1.2-kb fragment containing the full-length coding region of HIS3 was obtained from plasmid pRS303 by digesting with EcoRI and filled in with Klenow PolI. The resultant fragment was ligated into the EcoRV site of pGEM-MTO2 to replace the EcoRV fragment containing the MTO2 coding region. The resultant plasmid containing the MTO2::HIS3 allele was digested with HindIII and XbaI, and the fragment was introduced into wild type yeast strains W1021-7C and W303-1B by the method of Gietz and Schestl (32Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The integrated deletion construct was selected for the cells by growing on glucose-minimal medium in the absence of histidine. Disruption was verified by PCR amplification using primers 5′-ATGCTGGCAAGATATTTAAA-3′ (nt 305-324) and 5′-AAGGACTCATCGTCGAT-3′ (nt 1493-1510). Mitochondrial Gene Expression Analysis—Total cellular RNA was obtained using a Totally RNA™ kit (Ambion) from midlog phase yeast cultures (2.0 × 107 cells) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal amounts (20 μg) of total RNA were fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred onto a positively charged membrane (Roche Applied Science), and initially hybridized with the CYTB-specific RNA probe. The probe was synthesized on the corresponding restriction enzyme-linearized plasmid using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). RNA blots were then stripped and rehybridized with DIG-labeled COX1, 15 S rRNA and 21 S rRNA probes, respectively. As an internal control, RNA blots were stripped and rehybridized with a DIG-labeled nuclear 25 S rRNA probe. The plasmids used for mtDNA probes were constructed by PCR-amplifying fragments of CYTB (positions 36595-36964), COX1 (positions 26211-26689), 15 S rRNA (positions 7532-8280), and 21 S rRNA (positions 58484-59580) (GenBank™ accession number AJ011856) (33Foury F. Roganti T. Lecrenier N. Purnelle B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), as well as a nuclear 25 S rRNA probe (position 631-1665) (GenBank™ accession number U53879) and cloning the fragments into the pCRII-TOPO vector carrying SP6 and T7 promoters (Invitrogen). Analysis of Mitochondrial Protein Synthesis—Yeast strains were pulse-labeled for 2.5 min with [35S]methionine in methionine-free medium in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit cytoplasmic protein synthesis, as described elsewhere (34Barrientos A. Korr D. Tzagoloff A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled proteins were separated on SDS-exponential polyacrylamide gradient gels (2Guan M.X. Fischel-Ghodsian N. Attardi G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 35Chomyn A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 197-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gels were treated with Me2SO/2,5-diphenyloxazole, dried, and exposed for fluorography. Subcellular Localization of Yeast Mto2p—The coding sequence for MTO2 lacking its natural stop codon was obtained by PCR using pYMTO2 as a template. The primers 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGATGCTGGCAAGATATTTA-3′ (nt 305-322) and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGGTGCATGGGTGTCATTATT-3′ (nt 1538-1555) were used for PCR amplification. PCR products were first cloned into the pCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After sequence determination, the insert was subsequently subcloned into the expression vector pGFP-C-FUS under the control of the MET25 promoter (36Niedenthal R.K. Riles L. Johnston M. Hegemann J.H. Yeast. 1996; 12: 773-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The MTO2-GFP fusion construct or the vector pGFP-C-FUS alone was transformed into the wild type strain W303-1B. Resultant transformants were grown at 30 °C to midlog phases in 10 ml of glucose-minimal medium with 2% galactose and the appropriate auxotrophic requirements. To stain mitochondria, cells were incubated with 0.05 μm of MitoTracker™ Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Portland, Oregon) for 1 h at 30 °C. The cells were then examined under a Carl Zeiss confocal fluorescence microscope. Cloning and Expression of Human MTO2 cDNA—The coding region of human MTO2 cDNAs lacking its natural stop codon were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using the high fidelity Pfu polymerase (Promega). Total RNA was extracted from 143B cells to use as a template. The primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGCGGATGCAGGCCTTGCGGCAC-3′ (nt 52-69) and 5′-CGGAATTCCGAGCAAGGGACTCAGGCC-3′ (nt 1297-1314) (GenBank™ accession number AY062123) were used for the PCR amplification. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and EcoRI and cloned into pBluescript II KS+ (Promega). After sequence determination, the inserts were subcloned into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to generate pEGFP-N1-MTO2. The resultant construct or vector alone was transfected into the human 143B osteosarcoma cell line using the SuperFect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as detailed elsewhere (23Li X. Guan M.X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7701-7711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 24Li X. Li R. Lin X. Guan M.X. J.

S. cerevisiae wild type and mto2 strains used for this study were W301-1B and W303ΔMTO2(PR), respectively. A yeast expression shuttle vector pDB20 was used for the expression of human MTO2 in S. cerevisiae (37Becker D.M. Fikes J.D. Guarente L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1968-1972Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A human MTO2 cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification using pEGFP-N1-MTO2 as the template. Primers used for PCR amplification were 5′-AAGCTTAGCTGCAGCTGGCGAAGT-3′ (nt 20-38) and 5′-AAGCTTAGCAGCAAGCTGGCCCTT-3′ (nt 1338-1355). PCR products were cloned into PCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After sequence determination, the insert was subsequently subcloned into pDB20 to generate pDB20-MTO2. These constructs were transformed into the yeast W303ΔMTO2(PR) strain. Ura3+ transformants were selected at 30 °C on glucose-minimal medium. Transformants were then spotted on glucose and glycerol plates and incubated at 30 °C for 3-5 days. Colonies growing on glycerol medium were subjected to further analysis. Identification of Yeast MTO2—The product of the E. coli trmU sequence (30Green S.M. Malik T. Giles I.G. Drabble W.T. Microbiology (N. Y.). 1996; 142: 3219-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) was subjected to a BLAST search of the publicly available S. cerevisiae sequence databases (NCBI/Genbank™/EMBL). This search led to the identification of one open reading frame encoding a protein with a high degree of homology to E. coli TrmU. The S. cerevisiae homolog MTO2 on chromosome IV (YDL033C, GenBank™ accession number Z71781) is predicted to encode a 417-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 47,049 Da. The predicated yeast Mto2 polypeptide revealed an extensive conservation of amino acid sequences and similarity in size by an alignment with homologs, from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus (38Yan Q. Guan M.X. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1676: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila melanogaster, E. coli (30Green S.M. Malik T. Giles I.G. Drabble W.T. Microbiology (N. Y.). 1996; 142: 3219-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) to Bacillus subtilis. In particular, the overall identity of the predicted amino acid sequence of S. cerevisiae Mto2p with homologs of H. sapiens, M. musculus, D. melanogaster, S. pombe, B. subtilis, and E. coli is 35, 35, 36, 39, 41, and 39%, respectively, whereas the similarity is 47, 47, 47, 48, 51, and 49%, respectively. Mto2p is likely a mitochondrial protein, due to the presence of a typical mitochondrial target presequence (39Hartl F.U. Neupert W. Science. 1990; 247: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The mto2 Null Mutant Expresses a Respiratory-deficient Phenotype when Combined with the 15 S rRNA C1409G Allele—To determine whether MTO2 is essential for mitochondrial function, a single copy of the gene was disrupted in a haploid strain. The resulting mto2 null strains were tested for growth on glycerol-complete medium. As can been seen in Fig. 2, the mto2 null cells in the wild type mitochondrial background (PS) were able to grow on glycerol-complete medium, indicating that these cells were respiratory-competent. To test whether the mitochondrial genetic background affects the phenotypic expression of mto2 null mutants, the W303ΔMTO2(PS) strain was treated with ethidium bromide to cause the loss of mtDNA (ρo) (28Guan M.X. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ρo derivatives were then crossed with the M12-54 strain carrying the 15 S rRNA C1409G (PR) mutation or with the M12 strain carrying the identical nuclear genetic background and the PS allele (18Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The resulting diploids were sporulated and products of meiosis were dissected onto glucose medium. Meiotic progeny derived from the cross between the mto2 null ρo strain and M12-54 showed 2:2 segregation of the respiratory-competent phenotype. In all cases, the respiratory-deficient phenotype coincided with histidine independence (data not shown). By contrast, all four meiotic progeny from the cross between the mto2 null ρo strain and the wild type strain M12 (PS) were respiratory-competent, even though the His3+ phenotype showed 2:2 segregation patterns. Furthermore, the W1021ΔMTO2 ρo strain was also crossed with the mss1 strain A18 carrying the 15 S rRNA C1409G allele and sporulated. The resulting mss1/mto2 double mutants were unable to grow on glycerol medium. The double mutants were then examined for the presence of mtDNA by the PCR amplification of mitochondrial 15 S rRNA. All meiotic progeny from the cross retained the 15 S rRNA (data not shown), suggesting that the strains still retained mtDNA, despite some of them showing the respiratory-deficient phenotype. These data strongly suggested that the expression of respiratory deficiency in the mto2 null mutant was fully dependent on the presence of the 15 S rRNA C1409G mutation. mto2 Mutation Affects the Expression of Mitochondrial Genome—Previous studies revealed that the mss1 or mto1 mutation had effects on the expression of mitochondrial genes when carrying the C1409G allele (17Colby G. Wu M. Tzagoloff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27945-27952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 18Decoster E. Vassal A. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether the mto2 null mutation also affected the expression of mitochondrial genes by Northern blot analysis. RNA blots were hybridized with DIG-labeled probes for exon regions of CYTB, COX1, 15 S rRNA, and 21 S rRNA, respectively. In these mitochondrial genes, the 15 S rRNA gene lacks any intron, whereas the 21 S rRNA gene harbors two exons and one intron (33Foury F. Roganti T. Lecrenier N. Purnelle B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CYTB consists of six exons and five introns, whereas COX1 contains 8 exons and 7 introns (33Foury F. Roganti T. Lecrenier N. Purnelle B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). As an internal control, RNA blots were stripped and rehybridized with the DIG-labeled nuclear-encoded 25 S rRNA probe. As shown in Fig. 3, the 15 S rRNA and 21 S rRNA did not show obvious size changes and precursor accumulation in mto2 strains, as well as in mss1 and mto1 strains. However, there were increasing expressions of 15 S rRNA and 21 S rRNA genes in the mto2 cells in the PR background when compared with the wild type strain W303-1B. Deletion of MTO2 in the wild type mtDNA background had no obvious effect on CYTB processing, while it led to a slight accumulation of COX1 precursors. By contrast, in the presence of the 15 S rRNA PR allele, the mto2 mutant, similar to mss1 and mto1 mutants, had lower levels of mature CYTB mRNA and accumulated unprocessed or partially processed precursors. Furthermore, the COX1 probe detected an extremely low concentration of the mature mRNA and a high accumulation of unprocessed or partially processed precursors in mto2 mutants carrying the 15 S rRNA PR allele. It appeared that there were slightly different precursor accumulations of COX1 between mto2 and mss1 or mto1 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W2128847669,"Recently, the human SRBC (hSRBC) gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG), has been mapped to the chromosomal region 11p15.5–p15.4 where frequent allele loss has been described in lung cancer. Aberrant methylation (referred to as methylation) of the promoter region of TSGs has been identified as an important mechanism for gene silencing. Loss of hSRBC protein expression occurs frequently in lung cancer cell lines and sodium bisulfite sequencing of the promoter region of hSRBC in several lung cancer cell lines suggested that methylation plays an important role in inactivating hSRBC. To determine the methylation status of hSRBC in a large collection of primary lung cancer samples, corresponding nonmalignant lung tissues and lung cancer cell lines (N=52), we designed primers for a methylation-specific PCR assay. Methylation was detected in 41% of primary non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) (N=107) and in 80% of primary small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) (N=5), but was seen only in 4% of corresponding nonmalignant lung tissues (N=103). In all, 79% of lung cancer cell lines were methylated and the frequency of hSRBC methylation was significantly higher in SCLC (100%) than in NSCLC (58%) cell lines. Normal hSRBC protein expression was detected in only 18% of primary NSCLCs (N=93) by immunostaining and a significant association between loss of protein expression and methylation was found. hSRBC re-expression was observed after treatment of lung cancer cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. In addition, 45% of the 76 hSRBC immunostaining-negative NSCLCs did not have hSRBC promoter methylation, indicating that other mechanisms of hSRBC expression silencing also exist. Both hSRBC immunostaining and methylation results did not correlate with clinicopathological characteristics of these patients. Our findings suggest that hSRBC is a candidate TSG involved in lung cancer pathogenesis, where expression is frequently inactivated by methylation and other mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2009128174,"To identify genes associated with insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR)-mediated cellular transformation, we isolated genes that are differentially expressed in R− cells (derived from the IGF-IR knockout mouse) and R+ cells (R− cells that overexpress the IGF-IR). From these, 45 genes of known function were expressed at higher levels in R+ cells and 22 were expressed at higher levels in R− cells. Differential expression was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of R+ and R− cells. Genes expressed more abundantly in R+ cells are associated with (1) tumour growth and metastasis including, βigH3, mts1, igfbp5 protease, and mystique; (2) cell division, including cyclin A1 and cdk1; (3) signal transduction, including pkcδbp and lmw-ptp; and (4) metabolism including ATPase H+ transporter and ferritin. In MCF-7 cells IGF-I induced expression of two genes, lasp-1 and mystique, which could contribute to metastasis. Lasp-1 expression required activity of the PI3-kinase signalling pathway. Mystique was highly expressed in metastatic but not in androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell lines and Mystique overexpression in MCF-7 cells promoted cell migration and invasion. We conclude that genes identified in this screen may mediate IGF-IR function in cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W1970410041,"The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2/KDR/flk-1) functions as the primary mediator of vascular endothelial growth factor activation in endothelial cells. Regulation of VEGFR-2 expression appears critical in mitogenesis, differentiation, and angiogenesis. Transcriptional regulation of the VEGFR-2 is complex and may involve multiple putative upstream regulatory elements including E boxes. Transcript initiation is dependent on an initiator (Inr) element flanking the transcriptional start site. The transcription factor, TFII-I, enhances VEGFR-2 transcription in an Inr-dependent fashion. TFII-I is unusual both structurally and functionally. The TFII-I transcription factor family members contain multiple putative DNA binding domains. Functionally, TFII-I acts at both the basal, Inr element as well as at several distinct upstream regulatory sites. It has been postulated that the structure of TFII-I might allow simultaneous interaction with both basal and regulatory sites in a given promoter. As TFII-I is known to act at regulatory sites including E boxes as well as at the basal Inr element, we evaluated the possibility of Inr-independent TFII-I activation of the VEGFR-2 promoter. We found that an Inr-mutated VEGFR-2 reporter construct retains TFII-I-stimulated activity. We demonstrated that TFII-I binds to both the Inr and to three regulatory E boxes in the human VEGFR-2 promoter. In addition, reduction in TFII-I expression by siRNA results in decreased VEGFR-2 expression. We also describe counter-regulation of the VEGFR-2 promoter by TFII-IRD1.

This transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase transduces signals from extracellular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Other receptors for VEGF have been identified, but their roles in vasculogenesis are less well defined (2Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar). The VEGFR-2 is an early embryonic marker of endothelial cells with expression detected in mouse embryo as early as day 7 after conception (3Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). The critical role of VEGFR-2 in development was dramatically demonstrated through targeted disruption of the gene in mice (3Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X.F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). Homozygous deficient embryos died in utero between days 8.5 and 9.5 after conception due to severe abnormalities in development of the hematopoietic and endothelial systems. In addition to its role in development, VEGFR-2 has been shown to be involved in multiple pathologic conditions including tumor-induced angiogenesis (4Millauer B. Longhi M.P. Plate K.H. Shawver L.K.

Physiol. 2000; 279: L460-L467PubMed Google Scholar).Common to its role in both normal development and pathologic states is the process of transcriptional regulation of the VEGFR-2. The human and mouse VEGFR-2 5′-promoters have been identified (7Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A number of regulatory sites have been identified including a GATA binding site (8Minami T.

Res. 2000; 86: E110-E117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) shown to be involved in basal transcriptional activity. Deletional analysis of the 4-kb upstream region of human VEGFR-2 demonstrated that full promoter activity was dependent on the region between -225 and the transcriptional start site (7Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Further, 5′-deletion to -164 resulted in almost 50% loss of activity. This deletion resulted in the loss of an E box at -170 (Fig. 1B). The minimal promoter was further defined by 3′-deletions that identified the region up to +268 as necessary for maximal promoter activity (7Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The region from -225 to +268 includes a number of putative DNA binding motifs including three E boxes at -170, +70, and +184 (Fig. 1B).Further, Wu and Patterson (11Wu Y. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) identified a functional initiator (Inr) element in the VEGFR-2 gene that is transactivated by TFII-I. The Inr element is a poorly conserved 7-base pair sequence overlapping the transcription start site that can function in TATA-less genes, such as VEGFR-2, to direct transcription from a single start site (12Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In addition, the Inr can enhance transcription in TATA-containing genes (12Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). These studies showed loss of transcriptional activity in reporter systems with disruption of the Inr sequence. Thus, TFII-I has been implicated in regulating the expression of the VEGFR-2 gene.TFII-I, a ubiquitously expressed, multifunctional transcription factor, was originally described based on its in vitro binding to the core promoter element, Inr, as well as to the upstream E box element (13Roy A.L. Meisterernst M. Pognonec P. Roeder R.G. Nature. 1991; 354: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). TFII-I was independently identified as Bruton's tyrosine kinase-associated protein, BAP135, a substrate of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (14Yang W. Desiderio S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 15Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of two exons in TFII-I results in production of four isoforms (16Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26300-26308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that can form dimers with each other, with a related transcription factor, TFII-IRD1 (17Tantin D. Tussie-Luna M.I. Roy A.L. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5460-5469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and with several other helix-loop-helix transcription factors (18Roy A.L. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Dimerization, DNA binding, and transactivation domains of TFII-I have been defined (19Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8377-8383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The protein sequence includes six repeated motifs (so-called “I” repeats) that are putative helix-loop-helix (HLH) domains (Fig. 1A) (15Roy A.L. Du H. Gregor P.D. Novina C.D. Martinez E. Roeder R.G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7091-7104Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequence preceding the first repeat contains a modified leucine zipper critical for dimerization (19Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8377-8383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).TFII-I binds to and activates the promoters of several genes. These include xanthine dehydrogenase (20Clark M.P. Chow C.W. Rinaldo J.E. Chalkley R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2813-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), mullerian-inhibiting substance (21Morikawa N. Clarke T.R. Novina C.D. Watanabe K. Haqq C. Weiss M. Roy A.L. Donahoe P.K. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1075-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and mouse ribonuclease reductase R1 promoter (22Johansson E. Skogman E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30162-30167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), as well as the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat (23Mobley C.M. Sealy L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6511-6519Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In addition, three TFII-I binding sites were identified in the c-fos promoter (24Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). TFII-I appears to be unusual in having both basal transcriptional activity (via the Inr) and activity at upstream sequences such as the E box, serum-response element, c-sis platelet-derived growth factor-inducible element (S1E) (18Roy A.L. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, the structure of TFII-I with six loosely conserved repeats that resemble HLH domains has led to speculation that TFII-I acts as an adapter capable of binding with multiple partners (18Roy A.L. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 274: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The structure of TFII-I might make it particularly suited to a role in development by allowing it to link basal activity to various dynamically changing environmental signals.TFII-IRD1 (BEN/WBSCR11/MusTRD1/Cream1) protein shares similarity with TFII-I in the 95-amino-acid HLH-like I-repeat domain (hence, RD1) (25Bayarsaihan D. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7342-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The I domain is significantly larger than in other described basic HLH proteins (26Hinsley T.A. Cunliffe P. Tipney H.J. Brass A. Tassabehji M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The divergence of this motif from the HLH consensus has suggested that the I domain defines a distinct family of transcription factors (26Hinsley T.A. Cunliffe P. Tipney H.J. Brass A. Tassabehji M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The gene for TFII-IRD1 is located close to that of TFII-I on human chromosome 7q11.23 in the Williams syndrome critical region (25Bayarsaihan D. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7342-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 27Osborne L.R. Campbell T. Daradich A. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.C. Genomics. 1999; 57: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the two proteins may have arisen as a result of partial gene duplication (27Osborne L.R. Campbell T. Daradich A. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.C. Genomics. 1999; 57: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This family also includes the recently described TFII-IRD2 (28Tipney H.J. Hinsley T.A. Brass A. Metcalfe K. Donnai D. Tassabehji M. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 12: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The similarities in protein structure among the known family members have been detailed (26Hinsley T.A. Cunliffe P. Tipney H.J. Brass A. Tassabehji M. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TFII-IRD1 has been shown to associate with retinoblastoma protein (29Yan X. Zhao X. Qian M. Guo N. Gong X. Zhu X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). TFII-IRD1 has been shown to act as both a positive and a negative regulator of gene function depending on both promoter (30Polly P. Haddadi L.M. Issa L.L. Subramaniam N. Palmer S.J. Tay E.S. Hardeman E.C. J. Biol.

Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In addition to their structural similarities, there is growing evidence that TFII-I and TFII-IRD1 may functionally interact. The ability of TFII-IRD1 to interact physically with TFII-I was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments (17Tantin D. Tussie-Luna M.I. Roy A.L. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5460-5469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), contrasting with earlier reports that these structurally similar proteins could not heterodimerize (19Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8377-8383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Vullhorst D. Buonanno A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8370-8379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In the IgH promoter, both TFII-I and TFII-IRD1 bind to the downstream immunoglobulin control element, although only TFII-IRD1 was shown to functionally regulate this promoter element (17Tantin D. Tussie-Luna M.I. Roy A.L. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5460-5469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Further, in COS 7 cells, TFII-IRD1 was reported to inhibit translocation of TFII-I to the nucleus (32Tussie-Luna M.I. Bayarsaihan D. Ruddle F.H. Roy A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7789-7794Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, TFII-I and TFII-IRD1 may function in a counter-regulatory fashion.We hypothesized that TFII-I might act both in the basal regulation of VEGFR-2 expression as well as at upstream regulatory sites. We further hypothesized that TFII-I and TFII-I RD1 might act as counter-regulators of the VEGFR-2 promoter. Here we demonstrated that TFII-I activation of the VEGFR-2 occurs by interaction with both the Inr and the multiple E box elements. We showed that depletion of TFII-I in endothelial cells results in decreased VEGFR-2 expression. We also demonstrated that TFII-IRD1 is a negative regulator of the VEGFR-2 promoter. This negative regulation of the VEGFR-2 may, in part, be mediated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Antibodies to TFII-I were generated as described (33Danoff S.K. Taylor H.E. Blackshaw S. Desiderio S. Neuroscience. 2004; 123: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Anti-TFII-I antibody 3588 generated to an epitope common to both human (amino acids 150-163) and mouse TFII-I also cross-reacts with bovine TFII-I. Antibodies were generated to TFII-IRD1 using a peptide derived from the human sequence corresponding to amino acids 94-106. Anti-His (H-3) and anti-Flk-1 (N-931) antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Human TFII-I siRNAs constructs hTFII-I 2020 (DNA target sequence, 5′-AAGTTACTCAGCCAAGAACGA-3′) or hTFII-I 3390 (DNA target sequence, 5′-AAAGTATCAGTGGTTGAGAAG-3′) and control siRNA (no known homology, 5′-AAGAATTTGCACGAAAACGCC-3′) were obtained from Qiagen.Cell Culture—Bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (BPAE) cells were purchased from Cell Systems Corp. Cells were maintained in tissue culture medium containing 80% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, low glucose (Invitrogen), 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone), 1% minimal Eagle's medium non-essential amino acid solution 100× (Sigma), and 0.1% of initial mix endothelial cell growth factor (reconstituted with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) (Upstate Biotechnology). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All cells were used between passage numbers 5 and 8.Human pulmonary artery endothelial (HPAE) cells were from Clonetics (Cambrex). Cells were maintained in endothelial basal cell medium (Cambrex) with growth supplements (hydrocortisone, human fibroblast growth factor-B, VEGF, R3-insulin-like growth factor-1, ascorbic acid, heparin, fetal bovine serum, human epidermal growth factor, GA-1000) (EGM-2 bullet kit, Cambrex). Cells were used between passages 4 and 6.Transfection—For luciferase assays, BPAE were seeded in 24-well dishes such that the cells were 50-80% confluent at the time of transfection. Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) as recommended by the manufacturer. For 24-well plates, 0.6 μl of FuGENE 6 reagent/well and 200 ng of DNA/well were optimal. For most experiments, transfection efficiency was determined by FACS of cells transfected in parallel with GFP. Cells were assayed for luciferase activity at 24-48 h after transfection. Lysates were retained for Western analysis.For siRNA and FACS, HPAE were seeded in 6-cm dishes such that they were 50-80% confluent at the time of transfection. Transfection was performed using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. SiRNAs were co-transfected with 1 μg of pCIS2 as carrier DNA. Cells were assayed by FACS 24-48 h after transfection.For experiments with trichostatin A (TSA), BPAE were transfected as above in 24-well plates. Six hours after transfection, TSA diluted in Me2SO or an equivalent amount of Me2SO was added to wells. Luciferase activity was assayed 24 h after the addition of TSA.Luciferase Assays—Human VEGFR-2 (KDR)-pGL2 luciferase reporter constructs (4 kb, -225 to +268 and -225 to +268 Inr mutant) were a kind gift of Dr. Cam Patterson and are as described previously (11Wu Y. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected as described above and assayed for luciferase activity using Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega). Each transfection was assayed for firefly luciferase (test reporter) and Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Some assays were performed with β-galactosidase (pCSK-LacZ) to normalize for transfection efficiency. Luciferase assays were performed as recommended by the manufacturer following lysis of cells with passive lysis buffer. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed following lysis as above using β-galactosidase reporter gene assay (Roche Applied Science) as recommended by the manufacturer. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity were measured using a Tropix microplate luminometer (Applied Biosystems). All data are expressed as relative luciferase activity (firefly/Renilla or firefly/β-galactosidase, as indicated) and represent the mean of three individual transfections in a given experiment. Each experiment was performed at least three times. Data shown are representative of the replicate experiments. Data are expressed as mean and standard deviation.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Oligonucleotides representing the Inr and E box domains of the human VEGFR-2 promoter (Table I) as well as the reverse complement of each oligonucleotide were synthesized. Complementary oligonucleotide pairs were hybridized by heating to 95 °C for 5 min and cooling slowly to room temperature. Probes were end-labeled using T4-polynucleotide kinase. His-tagged hTFII-I was affinity-purified on a nickel column. Purified TFII-I was incubated with labeled oligonucleotide probe in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 50 or 70 μg/ml poly dG-dC. Unlabeled competitors were added as indicated. Sequences of the site-mutated competitors are indicated in Table I. After 20 (Inr, E (-170)) or 60 (E (+70), E (+184)) min at room temperature, the reaction was resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% non-denaturing acrylamide gel. After drying, the gel was placed on a PhosphorImager screen for visualization. Images were obtained after 12-48 h.Table ISequence of human VEGFR-2 oligonucleotide probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assaySiteSequence of probe (sequence of mutation)E box (−170)5′-CCCAGCGCAGTCCAGTTGTGTGGGGAAATG-3′CCGTATInr5′-CAGCTCCCACCCTGCACTGAGTCCCGGGAC-3′GTGCE box (+70)5′-CCTCTGCCTGCGCCGGGCATCACTTGCGCGCCGCAGAAAGTCCGTC-3′CCGTATE box (+184)5′-GCTCCCTAGCCCTGTGCGCTCAACTGTCCTGCGCTGCGGGGTGCCG-3′CCGTAT Open table in a new tab Staining for FACS—Cells were harvested using 0.5 mm EDTA and counted. For intracellular TFII-I staining, cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were resuspended in permeabilization buffer (0.5% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline) with anti-TFII-I antibody or normal rabbit serum as control. After 30 min at room temperature in the dark, cells were washed, and Cy5-anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was added at 1:100 as recommended by the manufacturer. After 30 min at room temperature in the dark, cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin. Staining for VEGFR-2 was performed with monoclonal anti-human VEGFR-2 (KDR)-phycoerythrin antibody (R&D Systems) exactly as recommended by the manufacturer.Transfected Cell Selection—HPAE were transfected essentially as described above. In addition to the plasmids indicated, pMACS Kk.II (Miltenyi Biotech) plasmid was included. After harvest, cells were incubated with MACS Select Kk MicroBeads as recommended by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were enriched by magnetic separation.Immunofluorescence—BPAE were plated on sterile glass cover slips and maintained in culture as above. When cells were 40-60% confluent, transfection with FuGENE 6 was performed as above. Cells were transfected with either GFP and TFII-IRD1 or GFP and pCIS. After 36 h in culture, cells were fixed and immunostained for TFII-I as described previously (33Danoff S.K. Taylor H.E. Blackshaw S. Desiderio S. Neuroscience. 2004; 123: 931-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Cells were imaged using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 TV microscope and Metamorph 4.5.6 software (Universal Imaging). Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM10 confocal microscope and LSM10 software (Zeiss).RESULTSThe VEGFR-2 promoter has been previously demonstrated to have a functional Inr that is transactivated by TFII-I (11Wu Y. Patterson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3207-3214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The promoter contains multiple putative TFII-I binding sites in addition to the Inr (7Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the structure of TFII-I with multiple DNA binding domains might support a more complex interaction with the VEGFR-2 promoter DNA. To validate the use of the previously described (7Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) minimal promoter (human VEGFR-2-225 to +268), we determined the TFII-I responsiveness of the complete promoter (4 kb) relative to that of the minimal promoter (Fig. 2A). We found the absolute activity of the minimal promoter to be greater than the complete promoter, suggesting that the minimal promoter lacks an inhibitory site. We determined that the fold activation by TFII-I was similar in the minimal and complete reporter constructs. In comparison, the promoter-less pGL2 Basic reporter showed no TFII-I response. We thus used the minimal promoter construct as the basis for further mutagenesis studies. The effect of TFII-I isoform was also tested. Transfection with TFII-I, isoform 1 (includes both alternative exons), and TFII-I, isoform 4 (includes neither alternative exon) showed no significant difference in luciferase activity (data not shown).Fig. 2Analysis of TFII-I stimulated VEGFR-2 promoter activity. A, comparison of VEGFR-2 minimal (-225 to +268) and complete (4 kb) promoter driving luciferase reporter. Upper, BPAE were transfected with either the minimal or the complete VEGFR-2 reporter construct as well as with Renilla luciferase and TFII-I or empty vector (pCIS) as indicated. The quantity of reporter plasmid was adjusted to maintain an equal number of moles as the complete construct was larger. Total DNA/transfection was constant. Data are expressed as mean of the relative luciferase activity (firefly/Renilla) performed in triplicate ± S.D. and are representative of four independent experiments. Lower, immunoblot of cell lysates probed with antibody as indicated. The transfected TFII-I (isoform 4) is apparent in the upper band of immunoreactivity. B, luciferase activity of minimal VEGFR-2 promoter with intact Inr, mutated Inr, and empty reporter plasmid. Upper, BPAE were transfected with minimal VEGFR-2 promoter (pGL2 Inr), minimal promoter with Inr mutated (pGL2 Inr mutant probe), or the promoter-less reporter construct (pGL2 Basic). Cells were also transfected with TFII-I or empty expression vector (pCIS) as indicated. Total DNA/transfection was constant. Data are expressed as mean of the relative luciferase activity (firefly/Renilla) performed in triplicate ± S.D. Lower, immunoblot of cell lysates probed with antibody as indicated. The transfected TFII-I (isoform 4) is apparent in the upper band of immunoreactivity. C, luciferase activity of minimal VEGFR-2 promoter with point mutations of putative TFII-I binding sites. Left, BPAE were transfected with the reporter construct indicated as well as with TFII-I or empty expression vector (pCIS). Total DNA/transfection was constant. Data are expressed as -fold increase in luciferase activity over basal (luciferase activity with TFII-I/luciferase activity with pCIS) for each promoter construct. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Right, immunoblot of cell lysates probed with antibody as indicated. The transfected TFII-I (isoform 1) is apparent in the lower band of immunoreactivity. Immunoreactivity in the pCIS-transfected cells represents native expression. Immunoblots show equal expression of transfected TFII-I under a specific condition. The immunoblot for 167 ng of TFII-I was performed separately and, thus, cannot be directly compared with the other blots.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mutagenesis of the VEGFR-2 Inr has been shown to resul"

https://openalex.org/W1514306633,"DNA damage normally induces p53 activity, but responses to ionizing radiation in the mammary epithelium vary among developmental stages. The following studies examined the hormones and growth factors that regulate radiation-responsiveness of p53 in mouse mammary epithelium. Immunoreactive p21/WAF1 and TUNEL staining were used as indicators of p53 activity following exposure to ionizing radiation. In ovariectomized mice, radiation-induced accumulation of p21/WAF1 was minimal in the mammary epithelial cells (<1%). Systemic injections of estrogen and progesterone (E+P) for 72 h were necessary to recover maximal expression of p21/WAF1 following ionizing radiation (55%). The effects of E+P on radiation-induced p21/WAF1 were p53-dependent as responses were absent in Trp53−/− mice. Though hormonal treatments stimulated increases in the proportion of cycling cells (PCNA-positive), this was not directly correlated with p53 activity. Whole organ cultures were used to determine whether E+P act directly upon the mammary gland. Treatment with E+P was sufficient to render p53 responsive to radiation, but TGF-β-neutralizing antibodies blocked responsiveness. In the absence of E+P, TGF-β1 alone did not alter p53 activity. These results demonstrate that estrogen and progesterone together with TGF-β signaling are necessary for maintenance of p53 activity in the mammary epithelium."

https://openalex.org/W1980958106,"RAS is a small GTP binding protein mutated in approximately 30% human cancer. Despite its important role in the initiation and progression of human cancer, the underlying mechanism of RAS-induced human epithelial transformation remains elusive. In this study, we probe the cellular and molecular mechanisms of RAS-mediated transformation, by profiling two human ovarian epithelial cell lines. One cell line was immortalized with SV40 T/t antigens and the human catalytic subunit of telomerase (T29), while the second cell line was transformed with an additional oncogenic rasV12 allele (T29H). In total, 32 proteins associated with RAS-mediated transformation have been identified using peptide mass fingerprinting. These protein targets are involved in several cellular pathways, including metabolism, redox balance, calcium signaling, apoptosis, and cellular methylation. One such target, the 40 kDa procaspase 4 is significantly upregulated at the protein level in RAS-transformed T29H cells, related directly to signaling through MEK, but not PI3 kinase. Cellular caspase 4 activity is, however, suppressed in the T29H cells, suggesting that the maturation process of caspase 4 is abrogated in RAS-transformed T29H cells. Consistent with this notion, transformed T29H cells were less susceptible to the toxic effects of anti-Fas antibody than were immortalized, nontransformed T29 cells, associated with less activation of caspase 4. This study demonstrates that functional proteomic analysis of a genetically defined cancer model provides a powerful approach toward systematically identifying cellular targets associated with oncogenic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2093213620,"RAI, also named ShcC/N-Shc, one of the members of the Shc proteins family, is a substrate of the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. Here, we show that RAI forms a protein complex with both RET/MEN2A and RET/PTC oncoproteins. By coimmunoprecipitation, we found that RAI associates with the Grb2-associated binder1 (GAB1) adapter. This association is constitutive, but, in the presence of RET oncoproteins, both RAI and GAB1 are tyrosine-phosphorylated, and the stoichiometry of this interaction remarkably increases. Consequently, the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) is recruited to the complex, and its downstream effector Akt is activated. We show that human thyroid cancer cell lines derived from papillary or medullary thyroid carcinoma (PTC or MTC) carrying, respectively, RET/PTC and RET/MEN2A oncoproteins express RAI proteins. We also show that human PTC samples express higher levels of RAI, when compared to normal thyroid tissue. In thyroid cells expressing RET/PTC1, ectopic expression of RAI protects cells from apoptosis; on the other hand, the silencing of endogenous RAI by small inhibitory duplex RNAs in a PTC cell line that expresses endogenous RET/PTC1, increases the rate of spontaneous apoptosis. These data suggest that RAI is a critical substrate for RET oncoproteins in thyroid carcinomas."

https://openalex.org/W1975679582,"Adenylate kinase, which catalyzes the reversible ATP-dependent phosphorylation of AMP to ADP and dAMP to dADP, can also catalyze the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding triphosphates. Lu and Inouye (Lu, Q., and Inouye, M. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 93, 5720–5725) showed that an Escherichia coli ndk mutant, lacking nucleoside diphosphate kinase, can use adenylate kinase as an alternative source of nucleoside triphosphates. Bacteriophage T4 can reproduce in an Escherichia coli ndk mutant, implying that adenylate kinase can meet a demand for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates that increases by up to 10-fold as a result of T4 infection. In terms of kinetic linkage and specific protein-protein associations, NDP kinase is an integral component of T4 dNTP synthetase, a multienzyme complex containing phage-coded enzymes, which facilitates the synthesis of dNTPs and their flow into DNA. Here we asked whether, by similar criteria, adenylate kinase of the host cell is also a specific component of the complex. Experiments involving protein affinity chromatography, immunoprecipitation, optical biosensor measurements, and glutathione S-transferase pulldowns demonstrated direct interactions between adenylate kinase and several phage-coded enzymes, as well as E. coli nucleoside diphosphate kinase. These results identify adenylate kinase as a specific component of the complex. The rate of DNA synthesis after infection of an ndk mutant was found to be about 40% of the rate seen in wild-type infection, implying that complementation of the missing NDP kinase function by adenylate kinase is fairly efficient, but that adenylate kinase becomes rate-limiting for DNA synthesis when it is the sole source of dNTPs. Adenylate kinase, which catalyzes the reversible ATP-dependent phosphorylation of AMP to ADP and dAMP to dADP, can also catalyze the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding triphosphates. Lu and Inouye (Lu, Q., and Inouye, M. (1996) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Adenylate kinase catalyzes the reversible ATP-dependent phosphorylation of AMP to ADP. The reaction is involved in the de novo biosynthesis of adenine nucleotides, and it is also thought to participate in adjusting adenine nucleotide levels to meet the energy demands of a cell (1.Noda L. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 8. Academic Press, New York1973: 279-305Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that the enzyme in Escherichia coli participates in phospholipid biosynthesis, although the specific involvement has not been defined (2.Goelz S.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Temperature-sensitive mutations in adk, the structural gene for adenylate kinase, cause defective phospholipid synthesis when bacteria are grown at a nonpermissive temperature (3.Haase G.H.W. Brune M. Reinstein J. Pai E.F. Pingoud A. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 207: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A novel capability for E. coli adenylate kinase was described when Lu and Inouye (4.Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that the wild-type adk gene could complement a site-specific disruption of ndk, the structural gene for nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Lu and Inouye (5.Bernard M.A. Ray N.B. Olcott M.C. Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that adenylate kinase could catalyze the conversion of nucleoside diphosphates to triphosphates. Experiments in our laboratory (5.Bernard M.A. Ray N.B. Olcott M.C. Hendricks S.P. Mathews C.K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2000; 32: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) showed that the phosphate donor for at least some of these reactions was ADP. So, instead of catalyzing the well known reaction, 2ADP [rlhar2] AMP + ATP, the enzyme was evidently substituting a different nucleoside diphosphate for one of the two ADPs: (d)NDP + ADP [rlhar2] AMP + (d)NTP. Both NDP 1The abbreviations used are: NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; ADK, adenylate kinase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; dNMP, dNDP, and dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphate, respectively; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside; DTT, dithiothreitol; ADK, adenylate kinase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; dNMP, dNDP, and dNTP, deoxyribonucleoside mono-, di-, and triphosphate, respectively; AMP-PNP, 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate. kinase and adenylate kinase were shown, some years ago, to participate in the synthesis of dNTPs after T4 infection of E. coli (6.Bello L.J. Bessman M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 72: 647-652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most reactions in T4 dNTP and DNA synthesis are catalyzed by phage-coded enzymes, consistent with the large increase in DNA accumulation rate per cell that occurs as a result of infection. An important exception is NDP kinase, an active enzyme of low specificity, which was found capable of phosphorylating the phage-modified nucleotide 5-hydroxymethyl-dCDP (7.Bello L.J. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1777-1787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is no phage-specific form of NDP kinase, and the bacterial enzyme carries out synthesis of all four dNTPs from the respective deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates. At the monophosphate level, however, a phage-coded enzyme is required, because no E. coli enzyme can phosphorylate 5-hydroxymethyl-dCMP to the diphosphate. This reaction is carried out by an unusual dNMP kinase, the product of gene 1, which also acts upon dGMP and dTMP (7.Bello L.J. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 1777-1787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Duckworth D.H. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2877-2885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This trifunctional enzyme, however, does not act upon dAMP, and it was assumed that the conversion of dAMP to dADP after infection is catalyzed by adenylate kinase; dAMP, like the other dNMPs, is derived from the breakdown of E. coli DNA, a process catalyzed by phage-coded nucleases. This is a quantitatively minor pathway, however, because nucleotides derived from host-cell DNA degradation represent only about 10% of the total nucleotides used for phage DNA synthesis (9.Mathews C.K. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 2092-2100Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The enzymes of dNTP synthesis in T4 infection interact to form a multienzyme complex, which we call the T4 dNTP synthetase complex (10.Mathews C.K. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and which facilitates the flow of metabolites en route to dNTPs, and their subsequent flow into DNA. E. coli NDP kinase interacts directly or indirectly with several T4 enzymes of dNTP synthesis and DNA replication, and we consider it an integral component of the dNTP synthetase complex (11.Shen R. Olcott M.C. Kim J. Rajagopal I. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32225-32232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In an early study (12.Allen J.R. Lasser G.W. Booth J.W. Goldman D.A. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5746-5753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) our laboratory found about 5% of the total adenylate kinase activity in the cell to cosediment with enzymes of the dNTP synthetase complex; NDP kinase behaved similarly. However, we did not inquire at the time whether the association of adenylate kinase with the T4 dNTP synthetase complex was functional, i.e. whether adenylate kinase is a specific component of the complex. This paper deals primarily with that issue. Plasmids, Phage, and Bacterial Strains—Bacteriophage T4D, a wild-type strain, has been maintained in this laboratory for many years. E. coli strains used included KA796 (ara, thi, Δprolac, ndk wild-type) and NR11814 (KA796ndk::cm), an ndk null mutant; both of these strains were obtained from Dr. Roel M. Schaaper, NIEHS National Institutes of Health. E. coli CV2 (fhuA22, ΔphoA8, adk-2(ts), ompF627(T R2), relA1, glpR2(glpC), glpD3, pit-10, spoT1, rrnB-2, mcrB1, creC510), used because of its ts mutation in the adk gene (13.Cronan Jr., J.E. Ray T.K. Vagelos P.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1970; 116: 199-210Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar), was obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University. E. coli Origami(DE3) was purchased from Novagen (Madison, WI). E. coli strains overexpressing T4 enzymes as recombinant proteins were as follows. E. coli HB101/pBK5, expressing gene 1 (dNMP kinase), was obtained from Dr. Maurice J. Bessman, Johns Hopkins University (14.Brush G.S. Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J.

Radioisotopic Compounds—[2,8-3H]Deoxyadenosine (18.4 Ci/mmol), [8-3H]deoxyguanosine (5.9 Ci/mmol), and [methyl-3H]thymidine (63 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals and Radiochemicals, Inc. (Brea, CA). Cloning and Expression of Adenylate Kinase—The adk gene, encoding E. coli adenylate kinase, was amplified from E. coli B genomic DNA by PCR using primers containing NdeI and BamHI restriction sites. Following ligation of the NdeI-BamHI fragment into the corresponding sites of pET-9a (Novagen), the pET9a-adk construct was transformed into competent DH5α cells. After PCR analysis of the transformants, the plasmid from one was sequenced and subsequently transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. For expression, 1-liter cultures of BL21(DE3)pLysS cells carrying the pET9a-adk plasmid were incubated in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. When the cells reached an optical density (600 nm) of 0.7, the overexpression of adenylate kinase was induced by addition of 500 μm IPTG. After 2–3 h of induction at 37 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the pellet was frozen in liquid N2. Purification of Recombinant E. coli Adenylate Kinase—The pellet was resuspended in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing leupeptin, pepstatin A, benzamidine, and aprotinin (11.Shen R. Olcott M.C. Kim J. Rajagopal I. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 32225-32232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Following sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 92,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was transferred to another tube to which streptomycin sulfate was slowly added to a final concentration of 1%. After pelleting the nucleic acid, the resulting supernatant was desalted on an Econo-Pac 10DG column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), and then applied to a POROS 10 HQ anion exchange column (4.6 × 100 mm) using a BioCad 700E Perfusion Chromatography Workstation (Applied Biosystems). Following a 2-min wash step in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), adenylate kinase was eluted with a 10-min linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0). The flow rate for the entire run was 5.0 ml/min. The major peak was concentrated in a Centriprep-10 (Millipore) at 4 °C and further purified on a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) in degassed 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl. The purified adenylate kinase was stored on ice in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT. For some early experiments the adk gene was cloned with a His6 tag. After PCR of the adk gene and treatment of the PCR product with NdeI and XhoI, the fragment was gel purified and ligated into plasmid pET-15b. After verification of the clone by sequence analysis, induction of the tagged adenylate kinase was carried out by addition of IPTG to a log-phase culture in LB broth plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin. After induction and centrifugation, the bacterial pellet was suspended in 10 volumes of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 1 mg/ml egg white lysozyme. After 20 min on ice, the resuspended cells were briefly sonicated, and the cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation (4 °C, 20,000 × g for 30 min), followed by filtration through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. The supernatant was applied to a HIS-select™ HC Nickel Affinity column (Sigma). After washing off unbound proteins with buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with buffer A plus 250 mm imidazole. Glutathione S-Transferase Pulldown Assays—GST fusion proteins were prepared, and GST pulldown experiments carried out, as described in previous publications from this laboratory (11.Shen R.

Fusion proteins made for this study included gp1 (deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate kinase), gp42 (dCMP hydroxymethylase), gpfrd (dihydrofolate reductase), and E. coli nucleoside diphosphate kinase. Each fusion protein gene, cloned in pGEX and expressed in E. coli Origami(DE3), was induced with 0.5 mm IPTG (1 mm IPTG for GST-gpfrd). For some experiments the GST fusion proteins were partially purified as follows. After induction, bacteria were centrifuged and resuspended in 10 volumes of buffer containing 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 2.7 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm DTT, plus 0.1 volume of egg white lysozyme, 10 mg/ml in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The resuspended cells were incubated on ice for 30 min, then briefly sonicated. DNase I was added (10 μg/ml), and incubation on ice was continued for 30 min more. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 4 °C at 15,000 rpm for 30 min, then filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter and applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity column. Unbound proteins were removed by extensive elution with 10 mm Na2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm DTT. Bound proteins were eluted with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, and 20 mm glutathione, and then dialyzed in 1000 volumes of 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 2.7 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Antisera and Coimmunoprecipitation Experiments—Purity of the histidine-tagged adenylate kinase was assured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 500 μg of purified enzyme, 1 mg/ml, was mixed with TiterMax gold adjuvant (Sigma) in a 1:1 ratio, and the solution was injected subcutaneously into two New Zealand White rabbits from which preimmune sera had been collected before injection. After 1 month, the rabbits were boosted intramuscularly with ∼250 μg of His-tagged ADK mixed 1:1 with TiterMax gold adjuvant. Subsequent boosts were done similarly. After antisera had been collected, their quality was tested by immunoblotting for endogenous ADK in a bacterial extract, and purified His-ADK was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. To purify E. coli ADK antibodies, 3 mg of purified His-ADK was immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) as described previously (21.Wheeler L.J. Wang Y. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7664-7670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M. Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol.

Antibodies in the antiserum were precipitated by adding ammonium sulfate to 40% saturation, and the precipitate was dissolved in 10 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 6.8), 500 mm NaCl, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 1000 volumes of the same buffer. The dialyzed solution was applied to the column containing immobilized His-tagged ADK. Unbound proteins were washed off with the same buffer. Bound proteins were then eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5), followed by elution with 100 mm triethylamine (pH 11.5). These collections were immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), followed by dialysis against 1000 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. Antibodies in the preimmune serum were purified similarly, on a column containing, not His-ADK, but Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were carried out by procedures similar to those described previously (20.Kim J. Wheeler L.J. Shen R. Mathews C.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thirty μl of purified antibodies to E. coli ADK or preimmune IgG (0.4 mg/ml) were incubated for 2 h on ice with 20 μl of radiolabeled cell extract in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.1 m potassium glutamate (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Each mixture was treated with Protein A-Sepharose beads, and the beads were washed and centrifuged as described (20.Kim J. Wheeler L.J. Shen R. Mathews C.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Each pellet was suspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and the suspension was placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, then subjected to one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Alternatively, pellets were suspended in nonequilibrium pH gradient buffer at room temperature prior to analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (20.Kim J. Wheeler L.J. Shen R. Mathews C.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Immobilized Protein Affinity Chromatography—Adenylate kinase (10 mg) and bovine serum albumin (12 mg) were immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 as previously described (21.Wheeler L.J. Wang Y. Mathews C.K. J.

A [35S]methionine-labeled extract of early T4 proteins (labeled from 3 to 8 min after infection at 37 °C) was applied to the ADK and BSA control columns, and elution was carried out with step increases of NaCl as described previously (21.Wheeler L.J.

Proteins in each eluted fraction were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography by a modification (20.Kim J. Wheeler L.J. Shen R. Mathews C.K. Mol.

Optical Biosensor Measurements—Direct measurements of protein-protein associations, involving the resonant mirror technique, used an IAsys optical biosensor (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK), as described in previous publications (11.Shen R.

Protein was immobilized in a carboxylate cuvette via 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide, as specified by the instrument manufacturer. The cuvette containing immobilized protein was equilibrated with running buffer (0.15 m potassium glutamate, 4 mm magnesium chloride, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) until a buffer baseline was established. The test protein was added to the specified concentration, and association was monitored as shown. Real-time refractive index data (in arc seconds) were recorded as specified by the manufacturer, for further analysis. After each experiment, immobilized protein in the cuvette was regenerated as specified by the manufacturer. DNA Synthesis Measurements—For measurement of DNA synthesis rates in T4-infected bacteria, cultures were grown to an optical density corresponding to about 2.5 × 108 ml–1 in NZC broth at 30 °C, then infected with T4D at a multiplicity of 5. After 3 min, [3H]thymidine was added to 100 μm at a specific activity of 0.3 mCi/μmol. At this relatively high thymidine concentration, endogenous sources of thymine nucleotides are bypassed, so that incorporation of exogenous thymidine quantitatively measures DNA synthesis (23.Mathews C.K. Sinha N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). At intervals, 50-μl aliquots of culture were pipetted onto squares of Whatman 3MM filter paper preimpregnated with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The squares were washed with trichloroacetic acid and ethanol, dried, and counted as previously described (23.Mathews C.K. Sinha N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). DNA synthesis was measured also in infected bacteria permeabilized by sucrose plasmolysis. Bacteria were grown, infected, subjected to plasmolysis, and sampled for measurement of DNA synthesis as previously described (24.Collinsworth W.L. Mathews C.K. J. Virol. 1974; 13: 908-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Reddy G.P. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3461-3467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture contained in 0.5 ml of 1 × 1010 infected bacteria, 32 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 64 mm KCl, 12 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. In one set of experiments (dNMP-dependent system), each incubation mixture contained 83 μm each of dAMP, dTMP, dCMP, and dGMP, 0.83 mm ATP, 0.4 mm ADP, and 100 μm [2,8-3H]deoxyadenosine at 0.09 mCi/μmol. In another series of experiments (dNDP-dependent system), each incubation mixture contained 83 μm each of dADP, dTDP, dCDP, and dGDP, plus ADP at 0.4 mm, ATP at 0.83 mm, and 42 μm each of CTP, UTP, and GTP, plus 100 μm [8-3H]deoxyguanosine at 0.03 mCi/μmol. Effect of ndk Mutation on Rate of T4 DNA Synthesis—Although adenylate kinase complements an ndk mutation for growth of E. coli (4.Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and T4 can productively infect an ndk mutant host strain (26.Zhang X. Lu Q. Inouye M. Mathews C.K. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4115-4121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the quantitative effect of an ndk mutation on T4 reproduction has not been reported. Therefore, we determined rates of radiolabeled thymidine incorporation into DNA after T4 infection at 30 °C of an isogenic pair of hosts, under conditions where thymidine incorporation gives a quantitative measure of the rate of DNA synthesis. As seen in Fig. 1, the rate of DNA synthesis was reduced by about 60%, relative to wild-type, in infection of an ndk mutant host. The yield of infectious phage was reduced proportionately, from 74 plaque-forming units per infected cell at 40 min after wild-type infection, to 36 for the mutant. Thus, complementation of the ndk function was not complete. Similar findings have been made in our laboratory in infection of a different pair of host strains (27.Bernard, M. A. (1999) Functions of Nucleotide Kinases of the Host Cell in the Bacteriophage dNTP Synthetase Complex. Ph.D. thesis, Oregon State UniversityGoogle Scholar). Although complementation by adk was incomplete, its apparent efficiency was surprising. Lu and Inouye (4.Lu Q. Inouye M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5720-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported the NDP kinase specific activity of adenylate kinase to be only 1–5% that of NDP kinase itself, depending upon the specific substrates used. This observation, to which we return to under “Discussion,” raises the question whether adenylate kinase is specifically associated with the dNTP synthetase complex. Affinity Chromatography with Adenylate Kinase as the Ligand—Each of the known enzymes in the dNTP synthetase complex, when immobilized on Affi-Gel™, has been shown to retain a specific ensemble of 6–12 early T4 proteins of dNTP synthesis and DNA metabolism (21.Wheeler L.J. Wang Y. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7664-7670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Wheeler L.J. Ray N.B. Ungermann C. Hendricks S.P. Bernard M. Hanson E. Mathews C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11156-11162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). If adenylate kinase is a specific component of the complex, we expect it to behave similarly. Accordingly, an extract of T4 proteins, labeled with [35S]methionine from 3 to 8 min after infection, was applied to an ADK column, and the moderately strongly bound proteins (retained at 0.2 m NaCl, eluted at 0.6 m NaCl) were displayed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 2, panel A. Panel B shows a control experiment carried out with immobilized bovine serum albumin. Proteins retained by the ADK column, but not by BSA, are assumed to be specifically associated, either directly or indirectly, with adenylate kinase. Prominent among these were gpfrd (dihydrofolate reductase), gp42 (dCMP hydroxymethylase), and several proteins of DNA replication and recombination, gp32 (single-strand DNA-binding protein), gpu-vsY (recombination and recombination-dependent DNA initiation), and gppseT (DNA 3′-phosphatase, 5′-kinase). An earlier analysis, using immobilized His-tagged ADK, showed the same proteins bound (data not shown), indicating that with this protein at least, the histidine tag does not interfere with protein-protein associations. Coimmunoprecipitation—Associations involving adenylate kinase were also investigated by an immunoprecipitation experiment. Antiserum was generated to purified His-tagged adenylate kinase. Fig. 3, panel A, shows that this antiserum strongly and specifically recognizes adenylate kinase in an extract of total T4 proteins. Purified antibodies from both ADK antiserum and preimmune serum were used to precipitate proteins from a [35S]methionine-labeled extract of T4-infected bacteria. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 3, panel B) showed several phage proteins precipitated by anti-ADK, but not by preimmune serum, the"
https://openalex.org/W2094109020,"The 'regulatory' beta-subunit of protein kinase CK2 has previously been shown to interact with protein kinases such as A-Raf, c-Mos, Lyn and Chk1 in addition to the catalytic subunit of CK2. Sequence alignments suggest that these interactions have a structural basis, and hence other protein kinases harboring corresponding sequences may be potential interaction partners for CK2beta. We show here that Chk2 specifically interacts with CK2beta in vitro and in cultured cells, and that activation of Chk2 leads to a reduction of this interaction. Additionally, we show that the presence of the CK2beta-subunit significantly reduces the Chk2-catalysed phosphorylation of p53 in vitro. These findings support the notion that CK2beta can act as a general modulator of remote docking sites in protein kinase--substrate interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2041317365,"This study reports a detailed analysis of the light-induced lateral migration of the photosystem II (PSII) antennae between appressed and non-appressed thylakoid membranes. The relative PSII antennae that migrated to stroma lamellae were readily established on the basis of peak areas of the separated stroma proteins in the ultraviolet chromatograms. Phosphorylation was predicted by intact molecular mass measurements, and this was confirmed by immunoblotting. When thylakoid membrane and chloroplasts were illuminated at 100 microE m(-2)s(-1), light-harvesting complex type II (Lhcb2) was the first PSII antenna to migrate, preferentially in phosphorylated form. However, the amount of Lhcb2 that migrated decreased after the first 20 min when the total amount of the three different Lhcb1 isoforms (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) reached maximum. Lhcb1.1 was always found in the unphosphorylated form and migrated later than the other two isoforms, although the latter were also found to have low levels of phosphorylation. At the same time, major antennae on the grana were not found to be phosphorylated, whereas Lhcb4 showed a significant increase in molecular mass. At higher light intensity Lhcb2 migration was negligible, whereas migration of Lhcb1 isoforms was little changed, increasing in irradiated chloroplasts. Because there was no significant phosphorylation at high light intensity, and yet pigments were found to have significantly increased on the stroma lamellae, it may be that pigments play a role in migration and that, in fact, there is no direct correlation between phosphorylation and migration. We hypothesize that the Lhcb1 isoforms expressed by the multigene families play a role in plant adaptation."

To our knowledge, this report for the first time demonstrates that the commitment to adapt unproductive pathways leading to protein misfolding/aggregation occurs in the denatured state ensemble. The mechanism by which a protein refolds to its unique native conformation remained shrouded in mystery until recently. It is no longer believed that protein folding/unfolding occurs via a specific channel of mandatory intermediate states. The “new view” of protein folding envisions folding as a stochastic search of many conformations available to a polypeptide chain (1Dill K.A. Chan H.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 10-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar, 2Dobson C.M. Sali A. Karplus M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

Science. 2002; 298: 2191-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In principle, the conformational search process is guided by the quest of the polypeptide chain to find the lowest energy structure (2Dobson C.M. Sali A. Karplus M. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1998; 37: 868-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). Although protein folding is a very efficient process, the folding reactions are known to go awry, leading to misfolding and aggregation of proteins (4Dobson C.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Previously it was believed that denatured states of proteins are random coil ensembles where the conformational averaging is independent of the neighboring environment (5Kumar T.K.S. Yu C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2004; 37: 929-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 6Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 3607-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar).

Hydrophobic clusters mostly formed by local side-chain interactions were observed to be populated in a number of proteins (7Lietzow M.A. Jamin M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 8Hudson M.E. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 732-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It is proposed that transient interactions between hydrophobic clusters that persist in the unfolded states are responsible for the initial collapse of the polypeptide chain that occurs during protein refolding (7Lietzow M.A. Jamin M. Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 655-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, the folding of barnase is believed to be initiated from the native-like local structures that persist in the unfolding state(s) (9Wong K.B. Clarke J. Bond C.J. Neira J.L. Freund S.M.V. Fersht A.R. Daggett V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1257-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In proteins like drkN, multiple types of structures ranging from conformers with non-native structure(s) possessing long range contacts to those with compact structures maintaining native-like secondary structures are found to be persistent in the denatured state(s) (10Choy W.Y. Mulder F.A.A. Crohwist K.A. Muhandiram D.R. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Crowhurst K.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8687-8695Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Consequently, these proteins adapt multiple pathways of refolding to their native state. Conformers with non-native hydrophobic contacts refold via a hydrophobic collapse mechanism, and those with a residual native-like secondary structure refold via a hierarchical condensation mechanism (10Choy W.Y. Mulder F.A.A. Crohwist K.A. Muhandiram D.R. Millett I.S. Doniach S. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 316: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 11Crowhurst K.A. Forman-Kay J.D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8687-8695Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the other hand, unfolded states of proteins, such as the chymotrypsin inhibitor with no detectable residual structures, refold cooperatively by a two-state mechanism (9Wong K.B. Clarke J. Bond C.J. Neira J.L. Freund S.M.V. Fersht A.R. Daggett V. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1257-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The results of these studies clearly demonstrate that the refolding mechanism adapted by a protein is strongly influenced by the nature of residual structures that persist in the ensemble of denatured states. In general, protein folding involves a kinetic competition between on-pathway reactions that result in the formation of the native state and non-productive pathways leading to misfolded states and, subsequently, aggregation (4Dobson C.M. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar, 13Jaenicke R. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 155-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Precursors for protein aggregation are often suggested to be folding intermediates such as the molten globule states (14Kazminiski S.L. Wong K.B. Freund S.M.V. Tan Y.J. Fersht A.R. Daggett V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4349-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 15King J. Haasepettingel C. Robinson A.S. Speed M. Mitraki A. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Safar J. Roller P.P. Gadjusek D.C. Gibbs C.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8375-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Brems D.N. Havel H.A. Proteins. 1989; 5: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), largely because such partial folded intermediates accumulate in connection with aggregation (17Brems D.N. Havel H.A. Proteins. 1989; 5: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Adv. Protein. Chem. 2002; 41: 12681-12686Google Scholar). Aggregation is primarily attributed to the attraction between interchain hydrophobic surfaces, which are transiently solvent-exposed in the folding intermediates (16Safar J. Roller P.P. Gadjusek D.C. Gibbs C.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8375-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It is generally believed that proteins in their unfolded states are not susceptible to aggregation because of the absence of native-like hydrophobic surfaces (19Uversky V.N. Segel D.J. Doncach S. Fink A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5480-5483Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This notion was proved incorrect by Silow et al. (20Silow M. Tan Y.J. Fersht A.R. Oliveberg M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13006-13012Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), who showed that, in proteins such as U1A, aggregation occurs directly through coalescence of the denatured states (20Silow M. Tan Y.J. Fersht A.R. Oliveberg M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13006-13012Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the formation of these aggregates is transient, and they dissociate so that individual chains fold. Chiti et al. (21Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar) reported that amyloid-like fibril formation is prevented in acyl phosphatase because of the stabilization of elements of local secondary structures in the denatured state(s) of the protein (21Chiti F. Webster P. Taddei N. Clark A. Stefani M. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3590-3599Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Although these studies provide useful clues to the interactions that lead to aggregation, very little information exists on the mechanisms that partition pathways toward productive folding or to misfolding and aggregation.

The secondary structural elements in the protein include 12 antiparallel β-strands arranged into a β-barrel structure.

In the present study we demonstrate that the folding mechanism of nFGF-1 depends on the time of incubation of the protein in the denaturant. nFGF-1 fails to refold to its native state upon prolonged incubation in 8 m urea. However, when the refolding is initiated in the presence of GroEL, the time period of incubation of the protein in the denaturant does not appear to significantly affect the refolding process. To our knowledge, this report for the first time demonstrates that areas of residual structure(s) in denatured state(s) dictate the kinetic partitioning of pathways leading to correct folding or misfolding of the protein. Unless stated otherwise, all solutions were prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm sodium chloride. All experiments were conducted at 25 °C. Equilibrium Unfolding—Denaturant-induced equilibrium unfolding was initiated by mixing appropriate volumes of 8 m urea (recrystallized from methanol) with fixed volumes of the stock solution of the protein (1 mg/ml). Equilibrium unfolding of nFGF-1 was monitored by steady state fluorescence and circular dichroism measurements as a function of the denaturant concentration. Fluorescence spectra were measured with a Hitachi F-2500 fluorometer at 2.5- or 10-nm resolution, using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. All fluorescence measurements were made using a protein concentration of 100 μg/ml. The sample temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a Neslab RTE-110 circulating water bath. Circular dichroism spectra were measured using a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter. CD spectra were collected with the slit width set to 1 nm, a response time of 1 s, and a scan speed of 20 nm/min. Each spectrum was an average of at least five scans. The concentration of protein used in the CD and fluorescence experiments was 50 μg/ml. The fraction of the protein in the native state at various urea concentrations was estimated from the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 350-308 nm. Refolding of the Protein—Refolding (at 25 °C) of nFGF-1 from the urea/guanidium hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denatured state(s) was initiated by a 20-fold dilution of the denatured protein with the refolding buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl). The protein was incubated in the denaturant (at 25 °C) for fixed time periods prior to the initiation of refolding. Protein dissolved in the denaturant (8 m urea) was constantly flushed with nitrogen to minimize oxidation of the protein. The concentration of protein used in the refolding experiments ranged from 20 to 480 μg/ml. Limited Protease Digestion—Protection of nFGF-1 (in the native state and the refolded/misfolded state obtained upon dilution from 8 m urea) against the action of trypsin was evaluated by incubating nFGF-1 (at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml) with 0.25 mg/ml trypsin in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The protease action was stopped by heating the mixture at 90 °C for 10 min. The products of the protease action(s) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The degree of protection against proteolytic degradation was estimated by measuring the intensity of the band (with SDS-PAGE) corresponding to nFGF-1 (remaining after protease digestion) by using a scanning densitometer. GroEL-mediated Folding—Refolding in the presence of GroEL was carried out by including the molecular chaperone (10 μm GroEL) in the refolding buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl and 100 μm ATP). The final ratio of GroEL to nFGF-1 in the refolding buffer was 10:1. Necessary background corrections were made to eliminate the spectral contributions of GroEL. The final concentration of nFGF-1 used in these experiments was ∼1 μm. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration experiments were performed at room temperature on a Superdex-100 column (using an ΔKTA fast protein liquid chromatography device purchased from Amersham Biosciences). All of the protein samples were normalized to 0.5 absorbance units prior to loading on to the column. 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl was used as the eluent. The flow rate of the eluent was set at 1 ml/min. Protein peaks were detected by their 280-nm absorbance. Under the experimental conditions used, no shrinkage of the resin was observed. NMR Experiments—NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker 700 MHz (cryoprobe) spectrometer. The concentration of the protein used in the two-dimensional heteronuclear NMR experiments was 0.1 mm. The protein samples were prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer (containing 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm mercaptoethanol, and 0.1 mm EDTA) by repeated exchange using Centricon ultrafiltration cartridges. All NMR data were acquired at a temperature of 25 °C. A denatured nFGF-1 sample was prepared by dissolving 0.1 mm protein in 0.5 ml of 8 m urea-d4 prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Solvent suppression was achieved by presaturation of the water signal during the relaxation delay, and quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was obtained with States-TPPI (time proportional phase incrementation) phase cycling. Urea-induced Equilibrium Unfolding of nFGF-1—nFGF-1 contains a single, well conserved tryptophan (22Srimathi T. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Chi Y.H. Srisailam S. Lin W.Y. Chiu I.M. Yu C. Biophys. J. 2002; 85: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The fluorescence spectrum of nFGF-1 is dominated by tyrosine fluorescence at 308 nm (Fig. 1A, inset) (22Srimathi T. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Chi Y.H. Srisailam S. Lin W.Y. Chiu I.M. Yu C. Biophys. J. 2002; 85: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, in the completely unfolded state nFGF-1 exhibits emission spectra dominated by tryptophan fluorescence at 350 nm (Fig. 1A, inset). These spectral features are ideal for monitoring the denaturant-induced unfolding/refolding of nFGF-1 (22Srimathi T. Kumar T.K.S. Kathir K.M. Chi Y.H. Srisailam S. Lin W.Y. Chiu I.M. Yu C. Biophys. J. 2002; 85: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of nFGF-1 is monitored by changes in the ratio of the fluorescence intensities at 350/308 nm. The ratio of fluorescence intensities at 350/308 nm yields a reliable estimate of the fraction of the native/unfolded species formed at various concentrations of urea. nFGF-1 is observed to unfold completely at urea concentrations beyond 3.8 ± 0.1 m (Fig. 1B). The concentration of urea (Cm) at which 50% of the nFGF-1 are unfolded (when ΔGu = 0) is estimated to be 3.0 ± 0.02 m. The change in free energy of stabilization (ΔGH2O) between the native and unfolded states of nFGF-1 is calculated to be 4.12 ± 0.12 kcal/mol. Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of nFGF-1 monitored by far-UV CD (at 228 nm) yielded nearly identical Cm (3.0 ± 0.08 m) and ΔGH2O (4.12 ± 0.08 kcal/mol) values, suggesting that the denaturant-induced unfolding of the protein is cooperative without the accumulation of detectable intermediate(s) (data not shown). Time-dependent Reversibility of the Denaturant-induced Unfolding of nFGF-1—Urea-induced unfolding of nFGF-1 at 25 °C is completely reversible (Fig. 1B). The urea-induced unfolding and refolding profiles of nFGF-1, obtained by monitoring tryptophan fluorescence, are completely superimposable (Fig. 1B). However, the reversibility of the urea-induced unfolding of nFGF-1 is observed to be dependent on the time of incubation of the protein in the denaturant (8 m urea). Refolding initiated (by 20-fold dilution of the protein in the denaturant) within ∼60 min of incubation in the denaturant (8 m urea) results in nearly complete (>85%) recovery of the protein in the native state conformation (Fig. 1A). However, the percentage of protein molecules regaining the native state progressively decreases with the increase in the time of incubation of the protein in the denaturant (8 m urea; Fig. 1A). The percentage of protein regaining the native state almost reaches zero when the time of incubation in 8 m urea exceeds 100 h. Failure of the Protein to Refold Is Independent of the Nature of the Denaturant Used—Time-dependent irreversibility of unfolding is also observed when an ionic denaturant such as GdnHCl is used. GdnHCl-induced unfolding of nFGF-1 is completely reversible when the refolding process is initiated within 3 h of incubation of the protein in 6 m GdnHCl (supplementary Fig. S1 in the on-line version of this article). The unfolding process is almost completely irreversible after >200 h of incubation of the protein in the denaturant (GdnHCl). The structural characteristics (as probed by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy) of the non-native, misfolded state(s) obtained by “refolding” of the protein (nFGF-1) after prolonged hours of incubation in 8 m urea (> 100 h) and 6 m GdnHCl (> 200 h) are similar (data not shown). These results clearly suggest that nFGF-1 fails to refold to its native conformation after prolonged incubation in the denaturant and that this phenomenon is independent of the chemical nature of the denaturant used. Inability of the Protein to Refold Is Not Due to Trivial Chemical Reactions Induced by the Denaturant—It is well known that chemical modification of side-chain groups during the refolding process often results in misfolding or aggregation of proteins (26Pace N.C. Tanford C. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Comparison of the electrospray ionization mass spectra of nFGF-1 incubated for 100 h in the absence of urea in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mm NaCl (wherein nFGF-1 is in the native conformation) and in the presence of 8 m urea (supplementary Fig. S2, available in the on-line version of this article) yielded the same molecular mass (15,147 Da), suggesting that the failure of the protein to refold (observed in nFGF-1) is not due to urea-induced chemical modification of the protein. Temperature is one of the physical parameters that has a profound influence on the protein folding reaction (27Jemth P. Gianni S. Day R. Li B. Johnson C.M. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Proteins subjected to refolding are often trapped as non-productive off-pathway intermediates. In some cases, increasing the temperature of the folding reaction results in the channelization of off-pathway intermediates to productive “folding track(s)” to yield the native state (27Jemth P. Gianni S. Day R. Li B. Johnson C.M. Daggett V. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6450-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this context, the refolding of nFGF-1 from its urea-denatured state was initiated (after 100 h of incubation in the denaturant) under various temperature conditions ranging from 15 to 35 °C. At a fixed protein concentration (100 μg/ml) and in the range of temperature used, the percentage of the protein molecules refolded to the native conformation remains <2% (data not shown). Folding of proteins often involves the formation of non-native oligomeric intermediate states (28Jaenicke R. Lilie H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 329-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In most cases, these non-native oligomeric species are off-pathway, dead-end intermediates (28Jaenicke R. Lilie H. Adv. Protein Chem. 2000; 53: 329-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Because oligomerization is a multimolecular reaction, the formation of the perceived oligomeric intermediate(s) is expected to increase with increase in protein concentration. In this context, the influence of protein concentration was examined by initiating the refolding of nFGF-1 after 100 h of incubation in 8 m urea. The percentage yield of the protein recovered in the native state did not show any significant variation with the increase in the protein concentration (in the concentration range of 25-500 μg/ml) used for the refolding reaction (Fig. 2). These results possibly suggest that the inability of the protein to refold to its native state, upon prolonged incubation in the denaturant, is not primarily due to formation of off-pathway oligomeric intermediate state(s). The possibility of misfolding/aggregation caused by the formation of non-native intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bonds can also be discounted, because “refolding” initiated in the presence and absence of a thiol reagent (such as β-mercaptoethanol) results in similar yields of the protein in the native state (data not shown). These results clearly suggest that the inability of the protein to refold to its native state (after prolonged incubation in the denaturant) is not due to trivial chemical reactions in the denatured state(s) or the inappropriate physical conditions used for refolding of the protein. Characterization of the Misfolded State—Size exclusion chromatography of the conformational states formed upon refolding (of the protein incubated for 100 h in 8 m urea) showed a single peak corresponding to the molecular mass of the monomeric form of nFGF-1 (∼15.2 kDa). UV light measurements at 350 nm reveal that the solution containing the protein in the misfolded state(s) remains clear even up to 48 h. Mild aggregation is noticed only after ∼60 h of incubation of the protein at room temperature. 1-Anilino-8-napthalene-sulfonate (ANS) is a fluorescent dye that binds to hydrophobic regions of proteins (29Uversky V.N. Semisotonov G.V. Pain R.H. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ANS has been used to probe solvent-exposed, non-polar surfaces in proteins. The dye generally exhibits weak binding affinity to the native and completely unfolded states of proteins (29Uversky V.N. Semisotonov G.V. Pain R.H. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ANS binds strongly to the misfolded state(s), and the emission intensity of ANS upon binding to the protein (nFGF-1) is more than twice that observed with the protein in its native and completely unfolded state(s) in 8 m urea (Fig. 3A). Fluorescence spectra of ANS (Fig. 3A) upon binding to the misfolded state(s) reveal that the emission maxima of the dye blue shifts by ∼30 nm (from 520 to 490 nm). These results suggest that the protein in misfolded state(s) has solvent-exposed, non-polar surfaces. Limited proteolytic digestion has been applied to investigate the conformational flexibility of proteins (30Wang L. Kallenbach N.R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2360-2464Google Scholar). The basic assumption underlying this technique is that the proteolysis event is governed by the stereochemistry and accessibility of the protein substrate as well as the specificity of the proteolytic enzyme. Hence, even subtle conformational changes in the protein could be successfully detected using the limited proteolytic digestion technique. nFGF-1 possesses many lysine and arginine residues in its sequence, and most of them are concentrated in the C-terminal segment (spanning residues 105-140), which constitutes the putative heparin binding site. As the cleavage sites for trypsin correspond to the carboxyl ends of lysine and arginine residues, trypsin is an apt choice to monitor the conformation of the misfolded state(s) of nFGF-1. Undigested nFGF-1 yields a band on SDS-PAGE, which corresponds to a molecular mass of ∼15 kDa (Fig. 3B). After 20 min of incubation, nFGF-1 (in its native state) with trypsin leaves ∼90% of the protein uncleaved. However, treatment of nFGF-1 in the misfolded state(s) with trypsin shows that >90% of the15-kDa band is cleaved (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the protein in the misfolded state(s) has high conformational flexibility. 1H-15N HSQC spectrum is a fingerprint of the backbone conformation of a protein (31Hajduk P.J. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1999; 32: 211-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of nFGF-1 is well dispersed, and all of the 126 cross-peaks in the protein can be unambiguously identified (Fig. 4A), implying that the protein in its native state is well structured (Fig. 4A). Comparison of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the native and the misfolded state(s) shows that the misfolded state(s) of the protein is primarily unstructured and that most of the 1H-15N cross-peaks are located within a very narrow region of the spectrum (Fig. 4, B and C). These results suggest that refolding of nFGF-1 upon prolonged incubation in the denaturant results in entrapment of the protein in a conformational state(s) that has structural characteristics resembling that of the denatured state(s). GroEL Prevents the Formation of the Misfolded State(s)— Molecular chaperones such as GroEL are known to aid proteins to fold to their native conformations by suppressing the accumulation of unproductive, off-pathway intermediates that lead to misfolding and aggregation of proteins (32Thirumalai D. Lorimer G.H. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2001; 30: 245-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 33Shtilerman M. Lorimer G.H. Englander S.W. Science. 1999; 284: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 34Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2003; 36: 229-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In this context, we were curious to investigate whether GroEL can rescue the protein (nFGF-1) from being trapped in the misfolded state(s) formed upon refolding the protein that was subjected to prolonged incubation in 8 m urea. Fluorescence and far-UV CD spectra of nFGF-1 refolded after 30 min of incubation in 8 m urea overlap well with those obtained for the native state of the protein (Fig. 5, A and B, curves a and c). However, the spectral features (far-UV CD and fluorescence) of the protein refolded after a prolonged incubation in the denaturant (>100 h) resembles that of the denatured state(s) (Fig. 5, A and B, curves b and d). These results corroborate well with those of the limited trypsin cleavage and NMR data, which suggest that the misfolded state has structural features resembling those of the denatured state(s). Interestingly, refolding nFGF-1 (incubated in 8 m urea for 100 h) in the presence of a 10-fold excess of GroEL and ATP (at 100-fold excess) resulted in the regaining of the native conformation by a majority (>85%) of protein molecules. Attainment of the native conformation of nFGF-1 is exemplified by the steady state fluorescence spectrum of the protein with an emission maximum at 308 nm (Fig. 5A, curve e) and a far-UV CD spectrum with a positive ellipticity band centered at 228 nm (Fig. 5B, curve e), reminiscent of the native β-barrel structure in the protein. It should be mentioned that refolding initiated in the presence of 10-fold excess of GroEL (but in the absence of ATP) yielded only 10% of the protein in the native state (data not shown). These results suggest that GroEL can successfully rescue nFGF-1 from being entrapped in the misfolded state(s) in an energy-dependent manner. Steady state fluorescence and circular dichroism data only provide a gross picture of the conformational state(s) of a protein. Therefore, it is important to verify whether the conformational state of nFGF-1 attained in the presence of GroEL is indeed the native conformation of the protein. In this context we monitored the GroEL-mediated refolding (in the presence of ATP) of nFGF-1 using two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectroscopy. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of nFGF-1, refolded in the presence of 10-fold excess of GroEL and ATP (at 100-fold excess), is well dispersed and matches quite well with that obtained for the native protein (Fig. 4, A and D). These results unambiguously show that GroEL thwarts the formation of the misfolded protein and consequently guides the protein to the native conformation. The exact mechanism by which GroEL prevents the formation of misfolded state(s) is not clear. It appears that GroEL binds to one of the intermediates populated in the very early stages of the non-productive folding pathway(s) and redirects the protein to the folding track to yield the native state. Possible Mechanism(s) Underlying the Misfolding of nFGF-1—The non-productive pathway(s) leading to the formation of the misfolded state(s) appears to be the predominant pathway for the protein (nFGF-1) refolded after prolonged incubation in 8 m urea. The commitment to adapt the non-productive folding pathway(s) appears to occur in the denatured state ensemble. The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of nFGF-1 acquired after 30 min of incubation in 8 m urea resembles that of a typical denatured state(s) (Fig. 6A). All of the cross-peaks are distributed in a very narrow region of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum (8.0 to 7.0 ppm). Several new cross-peaks begin to appear (in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra) when the protein is incubated in 8 m urea beyond 40 h (Fig. 6A). The intensities of the new cross-peaks are observed to increase with time, suggesting that subtle conformational change(s) occur in the protein upon prolonged incubation in the denaturant (Fig. 6B) (35Lyte B.L. Volkman B.F. Westler W.M. Wu J.H.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 237-244Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These results suggest that nFGF-1 exists in at least two conformational states (D1 state and D2 state) in 8 m urea (Fig. 7). Prolonged incubation of the protein in 8 m urea appears to cause an irreversible conversion from the denatured state ensemble (D1) to another ensemble of denatured states (D2). Such multiple conformational states in the denatured state ensemble have also been reported in Staphylococcal nuclease (12Su Z.D. Arooz M.T. Chem H.M. Gross C.J. Tsong T.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2539-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Refolding initiated from one of these conformational states (D1 state) in nFGF is productive and results in the formation of the native state (Fig. 7). On the other hand, the other conformational state (D2 state) appears to be a committed step for the unproductive pathway(s) leading to the formation of the misfolded state(s) (Fig. 7). The conversion of the D1 state to the D2 state appears to be irreversible and under a kinetic control. The fraction of protein molecules adapting the D2 conformation appears to increase with the increase in the time of incubation of the protein in the denaturant (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Schematic representation of the conformational transitions that occur in the urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of nFGF-1. Urea-induced unfolding is completely reversible if the refolding from the denatured (D1) state to the native (N) state is initiated within 60 min of incubation in 8 m urea. The D2 state is the product of prolonged incubation (>100 h) of the protein in 8 m urea. It appears that the denatured state(s) ensemble (D1) converts irreversibly to the D2 state(s), which is committed to the unproductive pathway(s) leading to the formation of the misfolded state(s). The appearance of new 1H-15N cross-peaks observed in the HSQC spectrum (shown in Fig. 6A), acquired after 100 h of incubation of the protein in 8 m urea, possibly suggest a subtle conformational transition(s) in the denatured (D1 state to D2 state) ensemble. GroEL (in the presence of ATP) appears to bind to one of the early intermediates in the off-pathway (originating from D2 state) and re-channelize the protein to refold to its native state.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is reasonable to expect that the residual structure(s) constituting the D1 and D2 states are different. The D1 to D2 conformational transition could either represent a trans to cis isomerization of one or more proline residues in the protein or represent a stabilization of new hydrophobic cores formed upon prolonged incubation in the denaturant. The possibility of the existence of prolines in the cis configuration can be ruled out, because refolding initiated in the presence of cis-trans proline isomerase did not have a significant effect on the percentage of recovery of the native state (data not shown). Therefore, it appears that the D1 to D2 state transition is due to time-dependent restructuring of residual hydrophobic cores in the denatured state(s) of the protein. Once formed, the D2 state probably directs the protein to follow the unproductive pathway(s) leading to the formation of the misfolded state. GroEL appears to prevent the formation of the misfolded state by binding to early intermediates in the off-pathway (originating from the D2 state) and re-channelizing the protein to the folding track(s) to yield the native state (Fig. 7). At the present juncture, the mechanism proposed is purely speculative, and more experimental evidence such as the detailed structural characterization of the denatured state(s) is required to confirm the proposal. To our knowledge, this study is the first report of time-dependent conformational changes in the denatured state(s). We believe that this unusual folding phenomenon observed in nFGF-1 may also be found in other proteins. The results of the study unambiguously suggest that the commitment to unproductive folding pathways leading to aggregation/misfolding occurs in the denatured state(s) ensemble.
