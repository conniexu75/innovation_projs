https://openalex.org/W3038974679,"The mammalian immune system implements a remarkably effective set of mechanisms for fighting pathogens1. Its main components are haematopoietic immune cells, including myeloid cells that control innate immunity, and lymphoid cells that constitute adaptive immunity2. However, immune functions are not unique to haematopoietic cells, and many other cell types display basic mechanisms of pathogen defence3-5. To advance our understanding of immunology outside the haematopoietic system, here we systematically investigate the regulation of immune genes in the three major types of structural cells: epithelium, endothelium and fibroblasts. We characterize these cell types across twelve organs in mice, using cellular phenotyping, transcriptome sequencing, chromatin accessibility profiling and epigenome mapping. This comprehensive dataset revealed complex immune gene activity and regulation in structural cells. The observed patterns were highly organ-specific and seem to modulate the extensive interactions between structural cells and haematopoietic immune cells. Moreover, we identified an epigenetically encoded immune potential in structural cells under tissue homeostasis, which was triggered in response to systemic viral infection. This study highlights the prevalence and organ-specific complexity of immune gene activity in non-haematopoietic structural cells, and it provides a high-resolution, multi-omics atlas of the epigenetic and transcriptional networks that regulate structural cells in the mouse."
https://openalex.org/W3039975419,"The vascular interface of the brain, known as the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is understood to maintain brain function in part via its low transcellular permeability1-3. Yet, recent studies have demonstrated that brain ageing is sensitive to circulatory proteins4,5. Thus, it is unclear whether permeability to individually injected exogenous tracers-as is standard in BBB studies-fully represents blood-to-brain transport. Here we label hundreds of proteins constituting the mouse blood plasma proteome, and upon their systemic administration, study the BBB with its physiological ligand. We find that plasma proteins readily permeate the healthy brain parenchyma, with transport maintained by BBB-specific transcriptional programmes. Unlike IgG antibody, plasma protein uptake diminishes in the aged brain, driven by an age-related shift in transport from ligand-specific receptor-mediated to non-specific caveolar transcytosis. This age-related shift occurs alongside a specific loss of pericyte coverage. Pharmacological inhibition of the age-upregulated phosphatase ALPL, a predicted negative regulator of transport, enhances brain uptake of therapeutically relevant transferrin, transferrin receptor antibody and plasma. These findings reveal the extent of physiological protein transcytosis to the healthy brain, a mechanism of widespread BBB dysfunction with age and a strategy for enhanced drug delivery."

However, the global cellular response to ribosome collisions has not been explored. Here, we uncover a function for ribosome collisions in signal transduction. Using translation elongation inhibitors and general cellular stress conditions, including amino acid starvation and UV irradiation, we show that ribosome collisions activate the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and GCN2-mediated stress response pathways. We show that the MAPKKK ZAK functions as the sentinel for ribosome collisions and is required for immediate early activation of both SAPK (p38/JNK) and GCN2 signaling pathways. Selective ribosome profiling and biochemistry demonstrate that although ZAK generally associates with elongating ribosomes on polysomal mRNAs, it specifically auto-phosphorylates on the minimal unit of colliding ribosomes, the disome.

Together, these results provide molecular insights into how perturbation of translational homeostasis regulates cell fate. Cellular stress triggers a wide range of responses, from activation of pathways that promote cell survival to initiation of programmed cell death. Typically, cellular stress responses first allow cells to adapt and recover from the specific stress; and if the stimulatory insult cannot be resolved, they initiate death signaling pathways. The capacity of the cell to mount an appropriate response to environmental or intracellular stress is critical for determining cell fate. Stress-activated protein kinases (SAPKs) are conserved from yeast to mammals and are critical determinants of cell fate in response to multiple environmental insults (Duch et al., 2012Duch A. de Nadal E.

Avruch J. Mammalian MAPK signal transduction pathways activated by stress and inflammation: a 10-year update.Physiol. Rev. 2012; 92: 689-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). There are two SAPK families in mammals: p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Activation of p38 induces cell-cycle arrest whereas activation of JNK promotes apoptosis (Darling and Cook, 2014Darling N.J. Cook S.J.

Acta. 2014; 1843: 2150-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar; Duch et al., 2012Duch A. de Nadal E. Posas F. The p38 and Hog1 SAPKs control cell cycle progression in response to environmental stresses.FEBS Lett. 2012; 586: 2925-2931Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In a process referred to as the ribotoxic stress response (RSR), SAPK signaling through p38/JNK is robustly triggered on short timescales (minutes) by agents that target the ribosome to induce elongation distress, including anisomycin (ANS), emetine (EME), and sarcin/ricin (Iordanov et al., 1997Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Ribotoxic stress response: activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK1 by inhibitors of the peptidyl transferase reaction and by sequence-specific RNA damage to the alpha-sarcin/ricin loop in the 28S rRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to ribosome-targeting agents, other studies established that UV irradiation is also a potent activator of the RSR (Iordanov et al., 1998Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Magun B.E. Ultraviolet radiation triggers the ribotoxic stress response in mammalian cells.J. Biol.

The UV (Ribotoxic) stress response of human keratinocytes involves the unexpected uncoupling of the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling cascade from the activated epidermal growth factor receptor.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5380-5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that ribosomal RNA (rRNA) damage caused by UV irradiation is critical to RSR activation (Iordanov et al., 1998Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.-H. Pearson J.A. Magun B.E. Ultraviolet radiation triggers the ribotoxic stress response in mammalian cells.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15794-15803Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Both ANS- and UV-stimulated activation of p38/JNK depend specifically on the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) ZAK (also known as MAPKKK20 or MLK7) (Jandhyala et al., 2008Jandhyala D.M. Ahluwalia A. Obrig T. Thorpe C.M. ZAK: a MAP3Kinase that transduces Shiga toxin- and ricin-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression.Cell.

Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19298-19305Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, molecular understanding of how ZAK monitors ribotoxic stress in the cell and activates the RSR remains unknown. A common response of cells to diverse stresses is the repression of global translation initiation. Two commonly used mechanisms for reducing initiation include the phosphorylation of eIF2⍺ by stress-specific kinases and the phosphorylation of 4E-BPs by mTORC1 (Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009Sonenberg N. Hinnebusch A.G. Regulation of translation initiation in eukaryotes: mechanisms and biological targets.Cell. 2009; 136: 731-745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Four different eIF2⍺ kinases exist in mammals, each initiating the integrated stress response (ISR) to promote cell survival in response to distinct stress conditions—GCN2 by amino acid limitation, PKR by double-stranded RNAs during viral infection, PERK by accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and HRI by heme deprivation. Although there are data indicating that GCN2 phosphorylates eIF2⍺ through sensing uncharged tRNAs that accumulate during amino acid starvation (Dong et al., 2000Dong J. Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M.

Juxtaposition of domains homologous to protein kinases and histidyl-tRNA synthetases in GCN2 protein suggests a mechanism for coupling GCN4 expression to amino acid availability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 4579-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), other studies show that GCN2 is activated by the isolated ribosomal P-stalk (Harding et al., 2019Harding H.P. Ordonez A.

Activation of GCN2 kinase by ribosome stalling links translation elongation with translation initiation.eLife. 2016; 5: e14295Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The degree of GCN2 activation correlates with the severity of ribosome stalling induced by amino acid starvation (Darnell et al., 2018Darnell A.M. Subramaniam A.R. O’Shea E.K. Translational Control through Differential Ribosome Pausing during Amino Acid Limitation in Mammalian Cells.Mol. Cell. 2018; 71: 229-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) consistent with a model wherein GCN2 directly monitors the global status of elongating ribosomes. Ribosome collisions have been shown to be the key cellular trigger for ribosome-mediated quality control in eukaryotic cells that targets problematic mRNAs (Yan and Zaher, 2019Yan L.L. Zaher H.S. How do cells cope with RNA damage and its consequences?.J. Biol. Chem. 2019; 294: 15158-15171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These pathways serve to minimize the toxic effects of incomplete peptide products generated from incomplete or problematic mRNAs; outputs of these pathways include targeting both the mRNA (by no-go decay [NGD]) and the nascent peptide (by the ribosome-mediated quality control complex [RQC]) for decay (Brandman and Hegde, 2016Brandman O. Hegde R.S. Ribosome-associated protein quality control..Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2016; 23: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although these pathways effectively manage occasional problems during translation, large-scale perturbations likely overwhelm the quality control machinery which is typically sub-stoichiometric to ribosomes across cell types (Kulak et al., 2014Kulak N.A. Pichler G. Paron I. Nagaraj N. Mann M. Minimal, encapsulated proteomic-sample processing applied to copy-number estimation in eukaryotic cells.Nat. Methods. 2014; 11: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Here, we bridge these ideas and identify elongating, colliding ribosomes as key communicators of cellular homeostasis, alerting cells to general stress and activating pathways to respond to this stress. More specifically, we show that activation of eIF2⍺ and SAPKs (p38/JNK), as induced by standard translation elongation inhibitors such as ANS and EME, is triggered by colliding ribosomes that have overwhelmed the quality control machinery. Activation of these two distinct stress response pathways depends on the MAPKKK ZAK. ZAK associates normally with elongating, transiently colliding, ribosomes, but under broad cellular stress, auto-phosphorylates on abundant more stable colliding ribosomes and activates downstream SAPK signaling pathways. Finally, we show that standard physiological stressors, including amino acid starvation and UV irradiation, strongly activate these same signaling pathways. Although the RSR is known to be triggered by elongation distress during translation, the molecular mechanisms associated with activation have been obscure (Iordanov et al., 1997Iordanov M.S. Pribnow D. Magun J.L. Dinh T.H. Pearson J.A. Chen S.L. Magun B.E. Ribotoxic stress response: activation of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK1 by inhibitors of the peptidyl transferase reaction and by sequence-specific RNA damage to the alpha-sarcin/ricin loop in the 28S rRNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3373-3381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In light of recent studies implicating ribosome collisions in mRNA-specific quality control (QC), we first asked whether the RSR is activated by generally slow elongating ribosomes or instead by ribosome collisions. Ribosome collisions can be broadly induced in cells using translation elongation inhibitors such as ANS and EME, as previously reported (Juszkiewicz et al., 2018Juszkiewicz S. Chandrasekaran V. Lin Z. Kraatz S. Ramakrishnan V. Hegde R.S. ZNF598 Is a Quality Control Sensor of Collided Ribosomes.Mol.

Ribosome Collision Is Critical for Quality Control during No-Go Decay.Mol. Cell. 2017; 68: 361-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Here, we established conditions for each compound where high concentrations of inhibitor caused uniform stalling of ribosomes on mRNAs, while intermediate concentrations stalled only a subset of ribosomes, leading to widespread ribosome collisions between stalled and trailing ribosomes (Figure 1A). We directly monitored ribosome collisions by treating cellular lysates with a non-specific RNase (RNase A) and resolved the resulting ribosome population on a sucrose gradient. Although the majority of polysomes are collapsed to monosomes in all treatments, a minor fraction of ribosomes resists RNase treatment and sediments as disomes in unstressed cells (Figure 1B, black) (Arpat et al., 2019Arpat A.B. Liechti A. De Matos M. Dreos R. Janich P. Gatfield D.

Ribosome pausing and stacking during translation of a eukaryotic mRNA.EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3559-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, we observe the strongest accumulation of disomes at the intermediate (Figure 1B, orange) but not the high concentration (Figure 1B, gray) of ANS as compared to the unstressed sample. Similar titrations performed for EME, a translation elongation inhibitor targeting a distinct step in elongation, also reveal an increase in colliding ribosomes (Figure S1A). These data serve as a biochemical read out for the relative amount of colliding ribosomes under different cellular conditions.Figure S1Ribosome Collisions Activate SAPKs (p38/JNK), Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Representative polysome profiles from RNaseA-digested lysates of HEK293 cells treated with emetine (EME) at 0 (black), 0.24 (blue), or 48 mg/L (gray).

We next titrated the elongation inhibitors to determine whether activation of the SAPK signaling pathway (monitored through the phosphorylation of p38 or JNK) was sensitive to concentration. Strikingly, maximal levels of p38/JNK phosphorylation are observed in HEK293 cells at intermediate but not at high concentrations of ANS (Figure 1C). Importantly, high concentrations of ANS neither reduce cell viability over the course of the experiment (15–30 min) (Figure S1B) nor interfere with p38/JNK phosphorylation activated through tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-⍺) (Figure S1C), a cytokine that activates p38/JNK through a distinct mechanism (Kant et al., 2011Kant S. Swat W. Zhang S. Zhang Z.-Y. Neel B.G. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. TNF-stimulated MAP kinase activation mediated by a Rho family GTPase signaling pathway.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 2069-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We observe the same trends of optimal activation of p38/JNK phosphorylation at intermediate doses of EME (Figure 1D) and in multiple cell lines (Figures S1D and S1E). As additional validation that actively elongating ribosomes are required for the accumulation of collisions, we find that pretreating cells with high-dose EME to uniformly stall all ribosomes prevents p38 phosphorylation by subsequent addition of an intermediate dose of ANS (Figure 1E). Problematic mRNA sequences such as extended poly(A) stretches are also known to cause ribosome collisions (Chandrasekaran et al., 2019Chandrasekaran V. Juszkiewicz S. Choi J. Puglisi J.D. Brown A.

Molecular mechanism of translational stalling by inhibitory codon combinations and poly(A) tracts.EMBO J. 2020; 39: e103365Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We asked whether overexpression (OE) of collision-inducing reporter constructs with either no stalling sequence (A0) or a long poly(A) sequence (A60) would activate SAPK signaling. The reporter includes 2A skipping sequences that allow nascent GFP to escape degradation by the RQC and to be used to report on mRNA levels (Figure 1F, top). We observe increased levels of p38 phosphorylation in A60-transfected cells compared to either vector-only or A0-transfected cells (Figure 1F, bottom); the modest increase in p38 phosphorylation in A0-transfected cells likely results from ribosome collisions induced at the 2A skipping sequences that we document through ribosome profiling (Figure S1F). Together, these multiple lines of evidence support a model in which colliding ribosomes, and not slow individual elongating ribosomes, trigger the RSR in mammalian cells. A previous study identified the MAPKKK—ZAK—as the upstream kinase connecting ribotoxic stress to SAPK activation (Wang et al., 2005Wang X. Mader M.M. Toth J.E. Yu X. Jin N. Campbell R.M. Smallwood J.K. Christe M.E. Chatterjee A. Goodson Jr., T. et al.Complete inhibition of anisomycin and UV radiation but not cytokine induced JNK and p38 activation by an aryl-substituted dihydropyrrolopyrazole quinoline and mixed lineage kinase 7 small interfering RNA.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19298-19305Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Although ZAK has two major isoforms, ⍺ and β, the isoform that contributes to the activation of the RSR remains unknown. We generated a ZAK knockout (KO) cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 and then complemented the KO line with either the ⍺ or β isoform cDNA. Consistent with earlier studies, we show that ZAK is required for rapid p38 phosphorylation on treatment with an intermediate dose of ANS (Figure 2A, lanes 6–7). Cells complemented with ZAK⍺ but not ZAKβ are competent to trigger p38 phosphorylation (Figure 2A, compare lanes 8 and 10), suggesting that important determinants of activation lie within the 468 amino acid (aa) long C-terminal tail of ZAK⍺, as recently shown (Vind et al., 2020Vind A.C. Snieckute G. Blasius M. Tiedje C. Krogh N. Bekker-Jensen D.B. Andersen K.L. Nordgaard C. Tollenaere M.A.X. Lund A.H. et al.ZAKα Recognizes Stalled Ribosomes through Partially Redundant Sensor Domains.Mol. Cell. 2020; 78: 700-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Next, we used mutational analysis to define regions of ZAK⍺ responsible for activation. Although an ATP-binding defective variant of ZAK⍺, K45M (Gross et al., 2002Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. MRK, a mixed lineage kinase-related molecule that plays a role in γ-radiation-induced cell cycle arrest.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), fails to activate p38 phosphorylation upon ANS stimulation (Figure 2A, lanes 8–9), mutation of three different motifs within the C-terminal tail including a leucine-zipper (LZ) domain, a sterile alpha motif (SAM), and a cryptic RNA-binding motif had no impact on p38 activation (Figure S2A). Given that there is no detailed structural information on the ZAK⍺ C-terminal tail, we systematically generated ZAK⍺ C-terminal deletions. Deletion of the C-terminal 80 aa (ZAK⍺ 1–720) slightly reduces the levels of p38 phosphorylation (Figure 2B, lanes 1–2 and 4–5), whereas deletion of the C-terminal 151 aa (ZAK⍺ 1–649) completely abolishes p38 phosphorylation (Figure 2B, lanes 3 and 6). Taken together, we define a region of ZAK⍺ as critical for activation of the RSR.Figure S2ZAKα Phosphorylation under ANS Stimulation, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Mutational analysis of ZAK.

Given that ZAK⍺ is a MAPKKK, a class of molecule that typically functions through autophosphorylation events (Rey et al., 2016Rey C. Faustin B. Mahouche I. Ruggieri R. Brulard C. Ichas F.

For both endogenous ZAK⍺ and ZAK⍺-FLAG OE (Figure S2B), ZAK⍺ phosphorylation is dramatically increased at intermediate but not high doses of ANS (Figures 2C and S2C); the phosphorylation status of shifted ZAK⍺ was validated by its sensitivity to phosphatase treatment (Figure S2D). We observe similar, albeit less robust, phosphorylation of ZAK⍺ on treatment with intermediate doses of EME (Figure 2D). Observed differences in the amplitude and pattern of ZAK⍺ phosphorylation with these different triggers (ANS versus EME) may impact downstream output from the signaling pathways. We next asked whether ZAK⍺ auto-phosphorylates as a mechanism for activation. First, ZAK⍺ phosphorylation was completely abolished in cells that only express the ATP-binding defective variant K45M (Figure 2E), as previously shown (Rey et al., 2016Rey C. Faustin B. Mahouche I. Ruggieri R. Brulard C. Ichas F. Soubeyran I. Lartigue L. De Giorgi F. The MAP3K ZAK, a novel modulator of ERK-dependent migration, is upregulated in colorectal cancer.Oncogene. 2016; 35: 3190-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); thus, the kinase activity of ZAK⍺ is essential for its own phosphorylation. To address whether ZAK⍺ functions in cis or trans, we supplied wild-type (WT) or K45M epitope-tagged ZAK⍺ to cells carrying endogenous ZAK⍺ and followed the phosphorylation status of the exogenous ZAK⍺ variant. These data show that exogenous ZAK⍺ is only phosphorylated when its own kinase domain is intact (Figure 2F); importantly, the exogenous ZAK⍺ is expressed at lower levels than the endogenous ZAK⍺ (exogenous/endogenous = ∼0.35) thus increasing the likelihood of trans activation were it to happen. These data provide compelling evidence that ZAK⍺ functions in cis to activate the RSR. We next asked whether ZAK⍺ directly associates with elongating ribosomes. Polysome profiling followed by western blot analysis reveals that substantial amounts of both ZAK⍺ and ZAK⍺-K45M associate with monosomes and polysomes, whereas ZAKβ does not (Figure 3A). Although the C-terminal 80 aa deletion construct (ZAK⍺ 1–720) shows somewhat reduced affinity to polysomes, the C-terminal 151 aa deletion construct (ZAK⍺ 1–649) fails to co-migrate with polysomes and predominantly associates with free mRNPs (Figure 3B). The correlation between polysome association of ZAK⍺ and p38 activation argues for direct binding interactions with the ribosome being critical to pathway activation. We next asked whether the association of ZAK⍺ with ribosomes changes upon ANS stimulation and found that ZAK⍺ associates with monosomes and polysomes independent of stimulation at the intermediate or high dose of ANS (Figure 3C). If our model that ZAK⍺ senses ribosome collisions and activates the RSR is correct, then we would predict that ZAK⍺ preferentially associates with colliding ribosomes relative to monosomes. When polysomes were collapsed by RNase treatment (Figure 3D, top panel), ZAK⍺ preferentially co-sediments with disomes (Figure 3D, compare fractions 5–7), independent of ANS dose. We suspect that the deep sedimentation of ZAK⍺ (Figure 3C) reflects interactions of ZAK⍺ either with single elongating ribosomes or with the ubiquitous transient ribosome collisions occurring in cells (Figure 1B). We used Phos-tag gels to monitor ZAK⍺ phosphorylation and found strong enrichment of phosphoryla"

However, some people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced have limited or no treatment options, owing to multidrug resistance6. In addition, suboptimal adherence to oral daily regimens can negatively affect the outcome of treatment-which contributes to virologic failure, resistance generation and viral transmission-as well as of pre-exposure prophylaxis, leading to new infections1,2,4,7-9. Long-acting agents from new antiretroviral classes can provide much-needed treatment options for people living with HIV who are heavily treatment-experienced, and additionally can improve adherence10. Here we describe GS-6207, a small molecule that disrupts the functions of HIV capsid protein and is amenable to long-acting therapy owing to its high potency, low in vivo systemic clearance and slow release kinetics from the subcutaneous injection site. Drawing on X-ray crystallographic information, we designed GS-6207 to bind tightly at a conserved interface between capsid protein monomers, where it interferes with capsid-protein-mediated interactions between proteins that are essential for multiple phases of the viral replication cycle. GS-6207 exhibits antiviral activity at picomolar concentrations against all subtypes of HIV-1 that we tested, and shows high synergy and no cross-resistance with approved antiretroviral drugs. In phase-1 clinical studies, monotherapy with a single subcutaneous dose of GS-6207 (450 mg) resulted in a mean log10-transformed reduction of plasma viral load of 2.2 after 9 days, and showed sustained plasma exposure at antivirally active concentrations for more than 6 months. These results provide clinical validation for therapies that target the functions of HIV capsid protein, and demonstrate the potential of GS-6207 as a long-acting agent to treat or prevent infection with HIV."
https://openalex.org/W3040600898,"The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key metabolic hub that controls the cellular response to environmental cues by exerting its kinase activity on multiple substrates1-3. However, whether mTORC1 responds to diverse stimuli by differentially phosphorylating specific substrates is poorly understood. Here we show that transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy4,5, is phosphorylated by mTORC1 via a substrate-specific mechanism that is mediated by Rag GTPases. Owing to this mechanism, the phosphorylation of TFEB-unlike other substrates of mTORC1, such as S6K and 4E-BP1- is strictly dependent on the amino-acid-mediated activation of RagC and RagD GTPases, but is insensitive to RHEB activity induced by growth factors. This mechanism has a crucial role in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, a disorder that is caused by mutations in the RagC and RagD activator folliculin (FLCN) and is characterized by benign skin tumours, lung and kidney cysts and renal cell carcinoma6,7. We found that constitutive activation of TFEB is the main driver of the kidney abnormalities and mTORC1 hyperactivity in a mouse model of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. Accordingly, depletion of TFEB in kidneys of these mice fully rescued the disease phenotype and associated lethality, and normalized mTORC1 activity. Our findings identify a mechanism that enables differential phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrates, the dysregulation of which leads to kidney cysts and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3038730871,"The cortex organizes sensory information to enable discrimination and generalization1-4. As systematic representations of chemical odour space have not yet been described in the olfactory cortex, it remains unclear how odour relationships are encoded to place chemically distinct but similar odours, such as lemon and orange, into perceptual categories, such as citrus5-7. Here, by combining chemoinformatics and multiphoton imaging in the mouse, we show that both the piriform cortex and its sensory inputs from the olfactory bulb represent chemical odour relationships through correlated patterns of activity. However, cortical odour codes differ from those in the bulb: cortex more strongly clusters together representations for related odours, selectively rewrites pairwise odour relationships, and better matches odour perception. The bulb-to-cortex transformation depends on the associative network originating within the piriform cortex, and can be reshaped by passive odour experience. Thus, cortex actively builds a structured representation of chemical odour space that highlights odour relationships; this representation is similar across individuals but remains plastic, suggesting a means through which the olfactory system can assign related odour cues to common and yet personalized percepts."
https://openalex.org/W3039200474,"Dental enamel is a principal component of teeth1, and has evolved to bear large chewing forces, resist mechanical fatigue and withstand wear over decades2. Functional impairment and loss of dental enamel, caused by developmental defects or tooth decay (caries), affect health and quality of life, with associated costs to society3. Although the past decade has seen progress in our understanding of enamel formation (amelogenesis) and the functional properties of mature enamel, attempts to repair lesions in this material or to synthesize it in vitro have had limited success4-6. This is partly due to the highly hierarchical structure of enamel and additional complexities arising from chemical gradients7-9. Here we show, using atomic-scale quantitative imaging and correlative spectroscopies, that the nanoscale crystallites of hydroxylapatite (Ca5(PO4)3(OH)), which are the fundamental building blocks of enamel, comprise two nanometric layers enriched in magnesium flanking a core rich in sodium, fluoride and carbonate ions; this sandwich core is surrounded by a shell with lower concentration of substitutional defects. A mechanical model based on density functional theory calculations and X-ray diffraction data predicts that residual stresses arise because of the chemical gradients, in agreement with preferential dissolution of the crystallite core in acidic media. Furthermore, stresses may affect the mechanical resilience of enamel. The two additional layers of hierarchy suggest a possible new model for biological control over crystal growth during amelogenesis, and hint at implications for the preservation of biomarkers during tooth development."

The core signalling pathways underlying the effects of phytohormones have been elucidated by genetic screens and hypothesis-driven approaches, and extended by interactome studies of select pathways3. However, fundamental questions remain about how information from different pathways is integrated. Genetically, most phenotypes seem to be regulated by several hormones, but transcriptional profiling suggests that hormones trigger largely exclusive transcriptional programs4. We hypothesized that protein-protein interactions have an important role in phytohormone signal integration. Here, we experimentally generated a systems-level map of the Arabidopsis phytohormone signalling network, consisting of more than 2,000 binary protein-protein interactions. In the highly interconnected network, we identify pathway communities and hundreds of previously unknown pathway contacts that represent potential points of crosstalk. Functional validation of candidates in seven hormone pathways reveals new functions for 74% of tested proteins in 84% of candidate interactions, and indicates that a large majority of signalling proteins function pleiotropically in several pathways. Moreover, we identify several hundred largely small-molecule-dependent interactions of hormone receptors. Comparison with previous reports suggests that noncanonical and nontranscription-mediated receptor signalling is more common than hitherto appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W3039911054,"Ribosomes accurately decode mRNA by proofreading each aminoacyl-tRNA that is delivered by the elongation factor EF-Tu1. To understand the molecular mechanism of this proofreading step it is necessary to visualize GTP-catalysed elongation, which has remained a challenge2-4. Here we use time-resolved cryogenic electron microscopy to reveal 33 ribosomal states after the delivery of aminoacyl-tRNA by EF-Tu•GTP. Instead of locking cognate tRNA upon initial recognition, the ribosomal decoding centre dynamically monitors codon-anticodon interactions before and after GTP hydrolysis. GTP hydrolysis enables the GTPase domain of EF-Tu to extend away, releasing EF-Tu from tRNA. The 30S subunit then locks cognate tRNA in the decoding centre and rotates, enabling the tRNA to bypass 50S protrusions during accommodation into the peptidyl transferase centre. By contrast, the decoding centre fails to lock near-cognate tRNA, enabling the dissociation of near-cognate tRNA both during initial selection (before GTP hydrolysis) and proofreading (after GTP hydrolysis). These findings reveal structural similarity between ribosomes in initial selection states5,6 and in proofreading states, which together govern the efficient rejection of incorrect tRNA."
https://openalex.org/W3021355959,"The interiors of giant planets remain poorly understood. Even for the planets in the Solar System, difficulties in observation lead to large uncertainties in the properties of planetary cores. Exoplanets that have undergone rare evolutionary processes provide a route to understanding planetary interiors. Planets found in and near the typically barren hot-Neptune ‘desert’1,2 (a region in mass–radius space that contains few planets) have proved to be particularly valuable in this regard. These planets include HD149026b3, which is thought to have an unusually massive core, and recent discoveries such as LTT9779b4 and NGTS-4b5, on which photoevaporation has removed a substantial part of their outer atmospheres. Here we report observations of the planet TOI-849b, which has a radius smaller than Neptune’s but an anomalously large mass of $$39.1{\,}_{-2.6}^{+2.7}$$ Earth masses and a density of $$5.2{\,}_{-0.8}^{+0.7}$$ grams per cubic centimetre, similar to Earth’s. Interior-structure models suggest that any gaseous envelope of pure hydrogen and helium consists of no more than $${3.9}_{-0.9}^{+0.8}$$ per cent of the total planetary mass. The planet could have been a gas giant before undergoing extreme mass loss via thermal self-disruption or giant planet collisions, or it could have avoided substantial gas accretion, perhaps through gap opening or late formation6. Although photoevaporation rates cannot account for the mass loss required to reduce a Jupiter-like gas giant, they can remove a small (a few Earth masses) hydrogen and helium envelope on timescales of several billion years, implying that any remaining atmosphere on TOI-849b is likely to be enriched by water or other volatiles from the planetary interior. We conclude that TOI-849b is the remnant core of a giant planet. Observations of TOI-849b reveal a radius smaller than Neptune’s but a large mass of about 40 Earth masses, indicating that the planet is the remnant core of a gas giant."
https://openalex.org/W3038415115,"Nuclear processes, such as V(D)J recombination, are orchestrated by the three-dimensional organization of chromosomes at multiple levels, including compartments1 and topologically associated domains (TADs)2,3 consisting of chromatin loops4. TADs are formed by chromatin-loop extrusion5–7, which depends on the loop-extrusion function of the ring-shaped cohesin complex8–12. Conversely, the cohesin-release factor Wapl13,14 restricts loop extension10,15. The generation of a diverse antibody repertoire, providing humoral immunity to pathogens, requires the participation of all V genes in V(D)J recombination16, which depends on contraction of the 2.8-Mb-long immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus by Pax517,18. However, how Pax5 controls Igh contraction in pro-B cells remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that locus contraction is caused by loop extrusion across the entire Igh locus. Notably, the expression of Wapl is repressed by Pax5 specifically in pro-B and pre-B cells, facilitating extended loop extrusion by increasing the residence time of cohesin on chromatin. Pax5 mediates the transcriptional repression of Wapl through a single Pax5-binding site by recruiting the polycomb repressive complex 2 to induce bivalent chromatin at the Wapl promoter. Reduced Wapl expression causes global alterations in the chromosome architecture, indicating that the potential to recombine all V genes entails structural changes of the entire genome in pro-B cells. Pax5 regulates contraction of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (Igh) locus—an essential step in V(D)J recombination—by promoting chromatin loop extrusion via repression of Wapl expression."
https://openalex.org/W3040253222,"Mammalian cells reorganize their proteomes in response to nutrient stress through translational suppression and degradative mechanisms using the proteasome and autophagy systems1,2. Ribosomes are central targets of this response, as they are responsible for translation and subject to lysosomal turnover during nutrient stress3–5. The abundance of ribosomal (r)-proteins (around 6% of the proteome; 107 copies per cell)6,7 and their high arginine and lysine content has led to the hypothesis that they are selectively used as a source of basic amino acids during nutrient stress through autophagy4,7. However, the relative contributions of translational and degradative mechanisms to the control of r-protein abundance during acute stress responses is poorly understood, as is the extent to which r-proteins are used to generate amino acids when specific building blocks are limited7. Here, we integrate quantitative global translatome and degradome proteomics8 with genetically encoded Ribo–Keima5 and Ribo–Halo reporters to interrogate r-protein homeostasis with and without active autophagy. In conditions of acute nutrient stress, cells strongly suppress the translation of r-proteins, but, notably, r-protein degradation occurs largely through non-autophagic pathways. Simultaneously, the decrease in r-protein abundance is compensated for by a reduced dilution of pre-existing ribosomes and a reduction in cell volume, thereby maintaining the density of ribosomes within single cells. Withdrawal of basic or hydrophobic amino acids induces translational repression without differential induction of ribophagy, indicating that ribophagy is not used to selectively produce basic amino acids during acute nutrient stress. We present a quantitative framework that describes the contributions of biosynthetic and degradative mechanisms to r-protein abundance and proteome remodelling in conditions of nutrient stress. During nutrient stress, ribosomal protein abundance is regulated primarily by translational and non-autophagic degradative mechanisms, but ribosome density per cell is largely maintained by reductions in cell volume and rates of cell division."

However, a subset of VTA neurons co-release DA and glutamate, and DA release might be responsible for behavioral reinforcement induced by VTA glutamate neuron activity. To test this, we used optogenetics to stimulate VTA glutamate neurons in which tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and thus DA biosynthesis, was conditionally ablated using either floxed Th mice or viral-based CRISPR/Cas9. Both approaches led to loss of TH expression in VTA glutamate neurons and loss of DA release from their distal terminals in nucleus accumbens (NAc). Despite loss of the DA signal, optogenetic activation of VTA glutamate cell bodies or axon terminals in NAc was sufficient to support reinforcement.

These results suggest that glutamate release from VTA is sufficient to promote reinforcement independent of concomitant DA co-release, establishing a non-DA mechanism by which VTA activity can support reward-seeking behaviors. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) has a pivotal role in the control of motivated behaviors. Dopamine (DA) transmission from VTA to nucleus accumbens (NAc) and other limbic structures contributes to the processes underlying motivated behavior and behavioral reinforcement and is a key structure for the initiation of drug addiction (Ikemoto and Bonci, 2014Ikemoto S. Bonci A. Neurocircuitry of drug reward.Neuropharmacology. 2014; 76: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). DA release from VTA neurons is sufficient to support positive reinforcement, reward learning, and to invigorate reward seeking; thus, DA release is often conceptualized as a primary reward signal (Berridge et al., 2009Berridge K.C.

Wang H.L. Barker D.J. Miranda-Barrientos J. Morales M. VTA glutamatergic inputs to nucleus accumbens drive aversion by acting on GABAergic interneurons.Nat.

Ventral tegmental area glutamate neurons co-release GABA and promote positive reinforcement.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This avoidance behavior might be a paradoxical consequence resulting from a preference for short duration trains of VTA glutamate neuron stimulation (Yoo et al., 2016Yoo J.H. Zell V. Gutierrez-Reed N. Wu J. Ressler R. Shenasa M.A. Johnson A.B. Fife K.H. Faget L. Hnasko T.S. Ventral tegmental area glutamate neurons co-release GABA and promote positive reinforcement.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Alternatively, glutamate release from VTA terminals in NAc might drive avoidance through preferential activation of NAc interneurons, even though DA co-release from a subset of these neurons contributes to reward (Qi et al., 2016Qi J. Zhang S. Wang H.L. Barker D.J. Miranda-Barrientos J. Morales M. VTA glutamatergic inputs to nucleus accumbens drive aversion by acting on GABAergic interneurons.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, it remains unclear whether the reward signals supporting self-stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons are mediated by glutamate per se, or by the concomitant co-release of DA. Here, we tested whether VTA glutamate projections to NAc drive reward independently of DA co-release. We generated conditional knockout (cKO) mice in which Tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) was specifically knocked out from VGLUT2-expressing neurons to disrupt DA synthesis. Optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons or their axon terminals led to robust DA release in NAc of controls but not cKO mice. Further, while cKOs displayed only a minor reduction in basal locomotor activity, loss of DA co-release did not abolish or otherwise impact self-stimulation or other measures of behavioral reinforcement. To overcome potential compensatory adaptations associated with the loss of Th from VTA glutamate neurons during development, we also implemented a virus-based CRISPR/Cas9 approach to disrupt Th expression and DA release from VTA glutamate neuron in adult mice, to similar effect. Together, our results indicate that VTA glutamate neuron activity can support robust behavioral reinforcement independent of their ability to recruit DA release. To test the contribution of DA co-transmission to VTA glutamate neuron function, we generated mice with conditional deletion of Th (Darvas and Palmiter, 2010Darvas M. Palmiter R.D. Restricting dopaminergic signaling to either dorsolateral or medial striatum facilitates cognition.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) selectively in VGLUT2-Cre-expressing neurons (Figure 1A). Brain sections from cKO (Slc17a6+/Cre; Thlox/lox), and heterozygous control littermates (control: Slc17a6+/cre; Th+/lox) were used to confirm the loss of TH in VTA glutamate neurons. Using a combination of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we found that ∼14% of neurons expressing VGLUT2 mRNA were also TH+ in control mice, whereas TH+ VGLUT2 neurons were essentially absent in the VTA of cKO mice (Figure 1B). Although numerous studies demonstrate that 10%–20% of VTA DA neurons express VGLUT2 in the adult, a much higher proportion transiently express VGLUT2 during development (Bérubé-Carrière et al., 2009Bérubé-Carrière N.

We also observed a corresponding decrease in TH-immunoreactive DA axon terminals in the NAc, and caudate/putamen (CPu) (Figures S1C and S1D). In contrast, DA transporter (DAT) immunoreactivity was unaltered, indicating that DA neuronal architecture was intact in cKO mice. Despite the reduced TH expression, we observed only a modest reduction in baseline locomotor activity in cKO mice, and locomotor responses to L-DOPA, amphetamine, or the D1R agonist SKF81297 were similar between cKO and control mice, suggesting intact psychomotor function (Figure S2). To control VTA glutamate neuron activity, we infused an adeno-associated virus (AAV) engineered for Cre-dependent expression of Channelrhodopsin-2:mCherry (ChR2:mCherry) into the medial VTA of control and cKO mice (Figure 1C). Approximately 15% of mCherry+ VTA glutamate cell bodies co-labeled with TH in control mice, but co-expressing cells were virtually absent in cKOs, further confirming the conditional loss of TH from VGLUT2+ VTA neurons (Figure 1D). To test whether the loss of TH from VTA glutamate neurons was sufficient to abolish evoked DA release, we used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) in brain slices through the medial NAc shell (Figure 1E). Optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate terminals in the NAc produced a robust frequency-dependent increase in evoked DA in controls but not the cKO (Figure 1F). However, bath application of DA (10 μM, 10 min) rescued ChR2-evoked DA transients in cKOs (Figure 1G), demonstrating that VTA glutamate terminals retain the capacity to release DA when substrate is available. Importantly, we also demonstrate that DA release is absent following optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons in vivo. In this experiment, ChR2 was expressed in VTA glutamate neurons, optic fibers were implanted in VTA, and carbon fibers were implanted in medial NAc (Figures 1H and S4). Optogenetic stimulation (1 s) elicited frequency-dependent DA release in control but not cKO mice (Figure 1I). Together, these results demonstrate the functional loss of NAc DA release in cKO mice upon optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons. To test whether glutamate release was altered in cKO mice, we measured excitatory postsynaptic currents (oEPSCs) evoked by optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate terminals in NAc (Figure S3A). We found 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3(1H,4H)-dione (DNQX)-sensitive oEPSCs of similar amplitude in cKO and control mice (Figure S3B), suggesting that, unlike DA release, glutamate transmission was intact. We also measured paired-pulse ratios (PPRs) and found substantial paired-pulse depression in both genotypes, though depression was reduced in the cKO (Figure S3C), which could be due to reduced DA auto-receptor activation at these excitatory pre-synaptic terminals (Adrover et al., 2014Adrover M.F.

The onset delay and deactivation time constant (τ) of oEPSCs did not differ across genotypes (Figure S3D). D1- and D2-type MSNs comprise >95% of NAc neurons but have distinct functional roles (Cole et al., 2018Cole S.L. Robinson M.J.F. Berridge K.C.

To test whether VTA glutamate neurons might preferentially impact these sub-populations, we used D1R-Cre × VGLUT2-Cre or A2a-Cre × VGLUT2-Cre double-transgenic mice to achieve conditional expression of (1) ChR2:EYFP in VTA VGLUT2 neurons and (2) mCherry in D1 or D2 (A2a) subtype-defined NAc MSNs (Figure S3E). To our knowledge, there is no VGLUT2 expressing neurons in the NAc nor D1R or A2a expressing neurons in VTA, cf. Allen Brain Atlas: Slc17a6 (73818754), Drd1 (352), and Adora2a (72109410) (Lein et al., 2007Lein E.S. Hawrylycz M.J. Ao N. Ayres M. Bensinger A. Bernard A. Boe A.F. Boguski M.S. Brockway K.S. Byrnes E.J. et al.Genome-wide atlas of gene expression in the adult mouse brain.Nature. 2007; 445: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (3129) Google Scholar). We observed oEPSCs at both MSN types, and no significant difference was detected between D1R+ versus putative D1R– nor A2a+ versus putative A2a– neurons (Figure S3F). PPR, delay, and τ were also unchanged across MSN subtypes (Figures S3G and S3H). Together these results show that VTA glutamate neurons do not make preferential contact onto D1-type compared to D2-type projecting MSNs. Previous work from our lab demonstrated that optogenetic activation of VTA glutamate cell bodies or their terminals in NAc can support intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) (Wang et al., 2015Wang H.L. Qi J. Zhang S. Wang H. Morales M. Rewarding effects of optical stimulation of ventral tegmental area glutamatergic neurons.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 15948-15954Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Yoo et al., 2016Yoo J.H. Zell V. Gutierrez-Reed N. Wu J. Ressler R. Shenasa M.A. Johnson A.B. Fife K.H. Faget L. Hnasko T.S. Ventral tegmental area glutamate neurons co-release GABA and promote positive reinforcement.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Curiously, mice that self-stimulated these neurons in an operant task showed a counter-intuitive frequency-dependent avoidance for their stimulation in a real-time place preference (RTPP) assay. However, this apparent avoidance was accompanied by an increased rate of entries into the active side and a preference for short duration trains of VTA glutamate neuron stimulation (Yoo et al., 2016Yoo J.H. Zell V. Gutierrez-Reed N. Wu J. Ressler R. Shenasa M.A. Johnson A.B. Fife K.H. Faget L. Hnasko T.S. Ventral tegmental area glutamate neurons co-release GABA and promote positive reinforcement.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). While these data imply distinct functional roles for VTA DA and glutamate neurons in positive reinforcement, optogenetic activation of VTA glutamate neurons also increases DA signaling in NAc (Figure 1) through transmitter co-release and/or local excitatory synapses onto VTA DA neurons (Dobi et al., 2010Dobi A. Margolis E.B. Wang H.-L. Harvey B.K. Morales M.

Commun. 2016; 7: 13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the contribution of DA to behavioral reinforcement driven by VTA glutamate neurons, we performed ICSS and RTPP using cKO mice that lack the ability to synthesize and co-release DA. ChR2:mCherry or mCherry was expressed in VTA glutamate neurons in control and cKO mice, and optic fibers were bilaterally implanted dorsal to medial NAc shell to target axon terminals. Mice were first tested on a 2-hole ICSS assay where nosepokes on hole “A” (active) triggered a laser to deliver a 1 s 40-Hz stimulus, while nosepokes on hole “B” (inactive) were without effect (Figure 2A). This frequency and pattern of stimulation was selected because prior works show that mice can discriminate and show preference for it and because VTA glutamate neurons can fire at similar frequency in response to salient stimuli (Root et al., 2018aRoot D.H. Zhang S. Barker D.J. Miranda-Barrientos J. Liu B. Wang H.-L. Morales M.

Ventral tegmental area glutamate neurons co-release GABA and promote positive reinforcement.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Across the first 4 test sessions mice displayed strong preference for the active hole with no significant differences detected between genotypes (Figures 2B). Over the subsequent 4 sessions holes “A” and “B” were swapped, and both genotypes switched their preference to engage with the active hole; mCherry-expressing control mice did not show a preference or a switch and performed few nosepokes (Figures 2B and 2C). We also tested a separate cohort of animals with optic fibers implanted dorsal to VTA glutamate cell bodies rather than NAc terminals (Figure 2D); these animals also displayed a robust preference for the active nosepoke with no difference between genotype (Figures 2E and 2F). We next tested mice in the RTPP procedure where they were provided free access to two compartments: entrance into active side A-triggered 40-Hz optogenetic stimulation that discontinued upon entry into side B (Figure 3A). When targeting VTA glutamate fibers in NAc, both genotypes spent less time in the active chamber and switched their side preference to the inactive chamber when side B was switched to active; mCherry-expressing mice showed no significant preference or avoidance (Figure 3B). Both genotypes also showed an increased approach rate into the active side compared to mCherry-expressing mice (Figure 3C), and there was no significant difference between controls and cKO mice that lack the evoked DA signal. Mice with implants dorsal to VTA were used to target the cell bodies (Figure 3D) and displayed similar patterns of active side avoidance (Figure 3E), with increased approach rates over time (Figure 3F), and no effect of genotype on these behaviors. Together, these results demonstrate that VTA glutamate neuron activation can drive self-stimulation and approach behavior in the absence of concomitant DA co-release, suggesting VTA glutamate neurons represent a DA-independent mesolimbic reward circuit. While the above data suggest that VTA glutamate neurons can convey a reinforcement signal that does not depend on increased DA release, the disruption of DA synthesis and release included neurons that do not express VGLUT2 in the adult due to transient developmental expression of VGLUT2 in a wider population of midbrain DA neurons (Figure S1). Further, loss of TH from early development might cause compensatory adaptations in cKO mice. To bypass these issues, we turned to a recently developed viral-based CRISPR/Cas9 approach to disrupt DA synthesis and release selectively from adult VTA neurons that express VGLUT2. This approach relied on a single AAV vector for Cre-dependent expression of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) and U6 promoter-driven expression of a single-guide RNA to induce indel mutations in the Th gene (sgTh) (Hunker et al., 2020Hunker A.C. Soden M.E. Krayushkina D. Heymann G. Awatramani R. Zweifel L.S. Conditional Single Vector CRISPR/SaCas9 Viruses for Efficient Mutagenesis in the Adult Mouse Nervous System.Cell Rep. 2020; 30: 4303-4316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This AAV vector (or sgCTRL) was infused together with AAV-DIO-ChR2:mCherry into VTA of VGLUT2:Cre mice (Figure 4A). Immunohistochemical analysis showed 19% of Cas9-expressing (VGLUT2) VTA neurons expressed TH in the sgCTRL group, but only 2% expressed TH in the sgTh group (Figure 4B). Using ex vivo FSCV, we found substantially reduced ChR2-evoked DA release in the sgTh- compared to sgCTRL-injected brains, demonstrating successful disruption of DA release from VTA glutamate neurons (Figures 4C and 4D). Exogenous DA application rescued evoked DA transients from the sgTh brains, confirming that VTA glutamate terminals retained the ability to recycle and release DA when substrate was available (Figure 4E). The sgCTRL and sgTh animals were also tested for self-stimulation of VTA glutamate neurons using the 2-hole ICSS task. In accordance with our results obtained in cKO mice, sgCTRL and sgTh mice displayed an equivalent preference for the nosepoke hole coupled to optogenetic stimulation of VTA glutamate terminals in NAc and switched preference when we switched the active nosepoke (Figure 4F). We observed similar results when the active nosepoke hole was coupled to optogenetic stimulation of glutamate cell bodies in VTA (Figure 4G). These data provide additional independent evidence that VTA glutamate neuron activity can support positive reinforcement absent concomitant increases in DA signaling. Prior work has demonstrated that, like VTA DA neurons, optogenetic activation of VTA glutamate neurons can support approach behaviors (Wang et al., 2015Wang H.L. Qi J. Zhang S. Wang H. Morales M.

Commun. 2016; 7: 13697Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the extent to which VTA glutamate neurons rely on DA signaling to drive reward behaviors remained unclear. Indeed, a subset of VTA glutamate neurons co-express DA markers and co-release DA directly (Kawano et al., 2006Kawano M. Kawasaki A. Sakata-Haga H. Fukui Y. Kawano H. Nogami H. Hisano S.

We identified a subset of open chromatin regions (OCRs), termed predicted regulatory elements (pREs), that are likely to function as developmental brain enhancers. pREs showed temporal, regional, and laminar differences in chromatin accessibility and were correlated with gene expression differences across regions and gestational ages. We identified two functional de novo variants in a pRE for autism risk gene SLC6A1, and using CRISPRa, demonstrated that this pRE regulates SCL6A1. Additionally, mouse transgenic experiments validated enhancer activity for pREs proximal to FEZF2 and BCL11A. Thus, this atlas serves as a resource for decoding neurodevelopmental gene regulation in health and disease."

The power of this approach is demonstrated by studying the process of reovirus release from intracellular vesicles during the early stages of infection and identifying intracellular virus-induced structures. Cell and tissue imaging methods have developed at an impressive rate in the last decade, and new techniques have provided unprecedented opportunities for accumulating biological insights (Toomre and Bewersdorf, 2010Toomre D. Bewersdorf J. A new wave of cellular imaging.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 26: 285-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Currently, cellular ultrastructure can be successfully imaged to a resolution of typically 2–5 nm by using scanning or transmission electron microscopy (EM) (Zhang, 2019Zhang P. Advances in cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging and classification.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2019; 58: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although EM methods do suffer from limited penetration depth (up to 0.5 μm in transmission EM). For 3D EM visualization of thicker samples, such as mammalian cells that can easily grow beyond 3 μm in thickness, sectioning and serial reconstruction methods can be employed to overcome this limitation, but they involve chemical treatment of samples or complex and laborious cryogenic workflows (Rigort and Plitzko, 2015Rigort A.

Zhou R. Cryosectioning.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 1018: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Another high-resolution 3D imaging method, soft X-ray tomography (SXT), has to date filled this need for direct mesoscale imaging of cellular ultrastructure in thicker vitrified samples, offering a penetration depth in the order of 10 μm, to a resolution of a few tens of nanometers, and the added benefit that samples require no chemical processing (Harkiolaki et al., 2018Harkiolaki M.

Three-dimensional cellular ultrastructure resolved by X-ray microscopy.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 985-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In addition, and complementary to both EM and SXT, optical microscopy continues to provide direct access to information on ultrastructure, organelle organization, and molecular localization within cells at variable resolution ranges (Giepmans et al., 2006Giepmans B.N.G.

Recent advances in the field include methods that reach classical optical resolution limits, as defined by the Rayleigh criterion (Rayleigh, 1879Rayleigh L. XXXI. Investigations in optics, with special reference to the spectroscope.Lond. Edinb. Dublin Philos. Mag. J. Sci. 1879; 8: 261-274Crossref Google Scholar), such as wide-field deconvolution (Wallace et al., 2001Wallace W. Schaefer L.H. Swedlow J.R.

Wilson T. The theory of the direct-view confocal microscope.J.

Beyond instrumentation, further benefits accrue in biological imaging through the combination of existing imaging methods in correlative schemes. Correlative imaging has contributed significant new insights into a range of cellular processes by providing complementary morphological, structural, and chemical information beyond what is achievable through the use of any single technique alone (Jahn et al., 2012Jahn K.A.

One of the challenges of high-resolution imaging of cells and tissue has been the preservation of native cellular structures and organization. For that reason, as an alternative to the widely used practice of chemical fixation, rapid cryo-freezing has emerged as the current gold standard for preserving delicate biological structures or arresting rapid dynamic processes in cells (Echlin, 1991Echlin P.

Vitrification was identified as a promising technique for biological sample preservation for ultrastructural imaging 40 years ago (Dubochet and McDowall, 1981Dubochet J. McDowall A.W. Vitrification of Pure Water for Electron Microscopy.J. Microsc. 1981; 124: 3-4Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and since then has developed into the method of choice for sample preparation for both X-ray imaging (Duke et al., 2014Duke E.M.H. Razi M.

Vitrified samples suffer no fixation artifacts and cellular structures are preserved faithfully in their pre-vitrification state (Kaufmann et al., 2014Kaufmann R. Schellenberger P. Seiradake E.

Super-resolution microscopy using standard fluorescent proteins in intact cells under cryo-conditions.Nano Lett. 2014; 14: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Fortuitously, fluorescence imaging at cryogenic temperatures is characterized by enhanced photo-stability of dyes and sharper emission spectra as compared to room temperature imaging leading to data with better signal to noise ratios (Kaufmann et al., 2014Kaufmann R.

Microsc. 2007; 227: 98-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the numerical aperture (NA) in cryo-FM systems is limited because there are currently neither suitable immersion fluids nor robust dipping objectives. As a result, cryo-fluorescence imaging is done by using air objectives with a maximum NA of circa 0.9, limiting the achievable optical resolution, and it still remains technically challenging to prevent ice crystal formation leading to sample damage while imaging under cryogenic conditions. Given these challenges, 3D-structure illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) emerges as the method of choice for imaging under cryogenic conditions (Demmerle et al., 2017Demmerle J. Innocent C. North A.J. Ball G. Müller M. Miron E. Matsuda A. Dobbie I.M. Markaki Y. Schermelleh L. Strategic and practical guidelines for successful structured illumination microscopy.Nat.

Image formation in structured illumination wide-field fluorescence microscopy.Micron. 2008; 39: 808-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) involves the use of patterned light that interacts with fluorophores on the imaging target resulting in low-frequency interference fringes (Moiré effect) that carry structural information beyond the diffraction limit of the system and can lead to an 8-fold increase in volumetric resolution. SIM has many distinct “selling-points” for cryogenic imaging: (1) it is easily applied to multi-channel imaging by using a range of common dyes or fluorescent proteins, opening up a wide range of biology for study; (2) it can image relatively thick samples, reducing the need for sample sectioning prior to imaging; (3) it uses relatively low light doses (10–100 W/cm2 laser power) and short image acquisition times (20–100 ms per single exposure), minimizing sample heating and, (4) it has extremely good out of focus light suppression, leading to high contrast images even in samples with thicknesses of 10 μm or more (Demmerle et al., 2017Demmerle J. Innocent C. North A.J. Ball G. Müller M. Miron E. Matsuda A. Dobbie I.M. Markaki Y. Schermelleh L. Strategic and practical guidelines for successful structured illumination microscopy.Nat. Protoc. 2017; 12: 988-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Indeed, SIM has been recently employed within a correlative scheme alongside single molecule localization microscopy to visualize cells in vitreous ice before imaging with scanning EM via focused-ion beam milling on the same cells after they are freeze-substitution stained (Hoffman et al., 2020Hoffman D.P. Shtengel G. Xu C.S. Campbell K.R. Freeman M. Wang L. Milkie D.E. Pasolli H.A. Iyer N. Bogovic J.A. et al.Correlative three-dimensional super-resolution and block-face electron microscopy of whole vitreously frozen cells.Science. 2020; 367: eaaz5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here, we present a correlative imaging scheme for biological samples at cryogenic temperatures that uses a purpose-built 3D-cryoSIM and a synchrotron soft X-ray microscope capable of tomographic imaging. These are available as an accessible and user-friendly imaging platform at beamline B24 (Harkiolaki et al., 2018Harkiolaki M. Darrow M.C. Spink M.C. Kosior E. Dent K. Duke E. Cryo-soft X-ray tomography: using soft X-rays to explore the ultrastructure of whole cells.Emerg. Top. Life Sci. 2018; 2: 81-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) at the national UK synchrotron, Diamond Light Source (DLS) (https://www.diamond.ac.uk). The techniques implemented are highly complementary and deliver comprehensive views of both cellular ultrastructure and molecular organization over extended cellular volumes in minimally perturbed cell populations. Moreover, once samples are vitrified, no further treatment or modification is required to go from one imaging modality to the next, and whole cell populations can be imaged at different microscopes in a matter of hours. We have applied this combination of imaging technology toward the investigation of the early events of reovirus infection in mammalian cells and, in particular, the mechanism of viral penetration of endocytic vesicles. Reovirus is an established experimental model for viral pathogenesis and has potential applications in the development of anticancer treatments (Roy, 2006Roy P. Reoviruses: Entry, Assembly and Morphogenesis. Springer-Verlag, 2006Crossref Google Scholar; Thirukkumaran and Morris, 2009Thirukkumaran C. Morris D.G. Oncolytic viral therapy using reovirus.Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 542: 607-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Viruses are infectious particles, which must enter a host cell to propagate. Therefore, crucial to any viral infection is the passage through the physical barrier of host membranes. For enveloped viruses, the mechanisms of virion delivery are relatively well understood and rely on fusion of the lipid bilayer of the viral envelope with the lipid bilayer of the host (White and Whittaker, 2016White J.M. Whittaker G.R. Fusion of Enveloped Viruses in Endosomes.Traffic. 2016; 17: 593-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Reovirus, however, as a non-enveloped icosahedral virus, does not have membrane fusing capacity, and how its core reaches the cytoplasm to initiate replication has remained largely elusive to date. Reoviruses have a segmented double-stranded RNA genome, which during viral infection is retained within the closed core particle, preventing the triggering of cellular innate immune responses. Viral core particles have both the RNA polymerase and the capping enzyme required for transcription of viral mRNA and viral replication. The core particle of reovirus is cloaked by the outer capsid, which is composed of proteins σ3 and μ1, plus the σ1 spike protein at the icosahedral 5-fold axes. σ1 and σ3 are involved in receptor attachment whereas μ1 plays a role in viral entry (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang L. Chandran K. Nibert M.L. Harrison S.C. Reovirus mu1 structural rearrangements that mediate membrane penetration.J. Virol. 2006; 80: 12367-12376Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) Reoviruses have been shown to enter cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and are subsequently trafficked through the endosomal pathway from the early Rab4-, Rab5-, or Rab11-positive endosomes to the late Rab7- or Rab9-positive endosomes (Boulant et al., 2013Boulant S. Stanifer M. Kural C. Cureton D.K. Massol R. Nibert M.L. Kirchhausen T. Similar uptake but different trafficking and escape routes of reovirus virions and infectious subvirion particles imaged in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2013; 24: 1196-1207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Mainou and Dermody, 2012Mainou B.A. Dermody T.S. Transport to late endosomes is required for efficient reovirus infection.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 8346-8358Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The escape of reovirus core particles from these endosomes to the cytoplasm has been linked to low-pH-dependent proteolytic degradation events (Dermody et al., 1993Dermody T.S. Nibert M.L. Wetzel J.D. Tong X. Fields B.N. Cells and viruses with mutations affecting viral entry are selected during persistent infections of L cells with mammalian reoviruses.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2055-2063Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is in vitro evidence that proteolytic removal of σ3 (likely to occur in endosomes because of gradual increase in acidity and digestion by low-pH dependent-cathepsins) (Ebert et al., 2002Ebert D.H. Deussing J. Peters C. Dermody T.S. Cathepsin L and cathepsin B mediate reovirus disassembly in murine fibroblast cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24609-24617Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), brings about the release of the N-terminally myristoylated μ1 peptide, which leads to pore formation (Sturzenbecker et al., 1987Sturzenbecker L.J. Nibert M. Furlong D. Fields B.N. Intracellular digestion of reovirus particles requires a low pH and is an essential step in the viral infectious cycle.J. Virol. 1987; 61: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Important unanswered questions regarding the mechanisms driving the early stages of reovirus infection include: (1) how soon after entry are replication-competent core particles released into the cytoplasm, (2) are they released at specific locations within the cytosol, and (3) is the ultrastructure of endosome vesicles affected by viruses during their entry, trafficking, and release? Our current lack of understanding of the details of core particle intracellular release is, in large part, due to the absence of technological solutions to visualize, at sufficient resolution, the cellular landscape during infection and its remodeling in response to viral infection. Given the current requirement to extend the application of super-resolution methods to the study of cryogenically preserved samples for the purposes of correlative imaging, we present here a 3D-SIM setup with an open optical design that overcomes many of the technical difficulties of 3D imaging fluorescence at super-resolution under cryogenic conditions. The conceptual starting point of reference for our design was the OMX platform (Carlton et al., 2010Carlton P.M. Boulanger J. Kervrann C. Sibarita J.-B. Salamero J. Gordon-Messer S. Bressan D.

Our results provide detailed mechanistic insights into NMDAR pharmacology, activation, and inhibition, which are fundamental to the brain physiology. Fast excitatory synaptic transmission is the fundamental currency for brain development and high-order brain functions including learning and memory formation. It is largely facilitated by a combination of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) including α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, kainate receptors, and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Synaptic currents and calcium signaling mediated by NMDARs are pivotal to neuroplasticity and are governed by diverse NMDAR subtypes defined by distinct hetero-tetrameric combinations of glycine binding GluN1 (1-4a or b) with either glutamate binding GluN2 (A-D) subunits and/or glycine binding GluN3 (A-B) subunits (Hansen et al., 2018Hansen K.B.

Dysfunctional NMDARs are implicated in various neurological diseases and disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, depression, stroke, epilepsy, and schizophrenia (Paoletti et al., 2013Paoletti P.

Furthermore, recent studies showed that neuroendocrine/ductal pancreatic cancers and breast cancers express NMDARs to mediate signaling for invasive tumor growth and brain metastasis, respectively (Li and Hanahan, 2013Li L.

Therefore, there are pressing needs to deepen mechanistic understanding of NMDAR functions to facilitate potential development of therapeutic reagents for not only neurological diseases and disorders, but also cancers. The most typical NMDARs contain two copies each of GluN1 and GluN2, which activate upon binding of the co-agonist glycine and the neurotransmitter agonist glutamate (Benveniste and Mayer, 1991Benveniste M.

NMDARs bind agonists and competitive antagonists at ligand-binding domains (LBDs) whereas many allosteric modulators bind at either amino terminal domains (ATDs) or LBDs to regulate opening and closing of the ion channel transmembrane domain (TMD) (Figure 1A). There has been progress in understanding the function of NMDARs in the last decade because of availability of structures of both isolated domains (ATDs and LBDs) (Furukawa and Gouaux, 2003Furukawa H.

All of the structures of agonist-bound intact NMDARs, including GluN1-GluN2B, GluN1-GluN2A, and GluN1-GluN2A-GluN2B NMDARs show extensive ATD-LBD interaction unlike AMPA and kainate receptors where ATD-LBD interactions are minimal, indicating that protein conformational changes in NMDAR ATDs and LBDs are coupled to each other (Hansen et al., 2018Hansen K.B.

This structural observation is consistent with the capability of the ATD to control multiple functions including open probability, deactivation speeds, and allosteric inhibition by ATD-targeting compounds (Gielen et al., 2009Gielen M.

With respect to competitive antagonism, previous structures of Xenopus GluN1-GluN2B NMDARs bound to the classical competitive antagonists 5,7-dichlorokynureinic acid (DCKA) and D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (D-AP5) showed unanticipated robust “rupture” of GluN1-GluN2B LBD dimers strikingly different from the structure of AMPA and kainate receptor competitive antagonist complexes (Zhu et al., 2016Zhu S. Stein R.A. Yoshioka C. Lee C.H. Goehring A. Mchaourab H.S. Gouaux E. Mechanism of NMDA Receptor Inhibition and Activation.Cell. 2016; 165: 704-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The pattern of LBD coupling to the TMD channel in these structures remains elusive due to low resolution (9–15 Å) where density for the TMDs and the LBD-TMD linker are not resolved. Importantly, there is no clear understanding of how GluN1- and GluN2B-specific competitive antagonists are capable of inhibiting the channel activities while the other subunit is occupied with agonists. Thus, despite advances in NMDAR structural biology, the mechanism leading to channel activation and inhibition remain ambiguous. To overcome this, we improved sample preparation methods to obtain cryo-EM structures of GluN1b-GluN2B NMDARs at overall resolution of 4 Å or better in complex with agonists glycine (Gly) and glutamate (Glu), a GluN1-specific competitive antagonist, L689,560 (L689), and a GluN2-specific competitive antagonist, SDZ-220-040, (SDZ) in the following combinations: Gly/Glu-bound, Gly/SDZ-bound, L689/Glu-bound, and L689/SDZ-bound. The high-resolution structures located antagonists in the LBDs and resolve the majority of side chains in every domain thereby, confidently defining the functional states of the structures and local changes at the gate-region of the TMD channel resulting from agonist- and antagonist-binding and providing a comprehensive mechanistic scheme for functional transitions related to subunit-specific competitive inhibition. Our study provides the blueprint for mechanistic understanding of NMDAR pharmacology, activation, and inhibition. Structural analysis of multi-domain heteromeric transmembrane proteins from the mammalian sources such as rat GluN1b-GluN2B NMDARs studied here, remain technically challenging because of low expression levels, improper multimeric assembly, and instability. To overcome these difficulties, we produced a rat GluN1b-GluN2B NMDAR construct (see STAR Methods) in the Sf9 insect cell-baculovirus expression system where both GluN1b and GluN2B subunits are expressed under the combination of the Drosophila Hsp70 promoter and hr1 enhancer element (Rodems and Friesen, 1993Rodems S.M. Friesen P.D. The hr5 transcriptional enhancer stimulates early expression from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus genome but is not required for virus replication.J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5776-5785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a p10 3′ untranslated region (UTR) (van Oers et al., 1999van Oers M.M. Vlak J.M. Voorma H.O. Thomas A.A.M.

This modification resulted in production of 0.4 mg of properly assembled GluN1b-GluN2B NMDAR proteins per liter insect cell culture.

For antagonist-bound samples, we observed protein aggregation in electron micrographs when an excessive amount (0.1 mM or above) of L689,560 or SDZ-220-040 was directly added during sample preparation. Thus, instead, we incorporated the antagonists by dialyzing GluN1b-GluN2B NMDAR purified in the absence of ligands against buffers containing 50 μM antagonist. Inclusion of EDTA and adjustment to pH 7.5 were also critical to eliminate ATD-mediated zinc and proton allosteric inhibition to monitor pure competitive inhibition. Finally, we collected large datasets containing 250,000–500,000 particle images to observe multiple protein conformations by effective 3D classification in single particle analysis. All of the above collectively contributed to structural analysis at a Fourier shell correlation-based resolution as high as 3.6 Å (Table S1), and all of the structures reported here were sufficiently high resolution to resolve cryo-EM densities for antagonists, therefore allowing us to unambiguously define the functional states of individual structures. We have previously reported cryo-EM structures of agonist-bound GluN1b-GluN2B; however, due to low resolution (∼6.0 Å) those structures did not resolve the linker region between the LBDs and TMDs, preventing assessment of how conformational alteration in the extracellular domains is transduced to the TMD ion channel to regulate activity. Using the improved methods described above, we obtained structures bound to the full agonists, glycine and glutamate, at ∼4 Å resolution as estimated by Fourier shell correlation using the 0.143 cutoff (Figures 1 and S1; Table S1). Here, we observed clear cryo-EM density for all of the domains including the bi-lobed clam shell-like architectures of ATDs (R1/R2) and LBDs (D1/D2), the channel forming TMDs and linker peptides for both GluN1b and GluN2B subunits (Figures 1 and S1). The ATDs and LBDs are assembled as a dimer of the GluN1b-GluN2B heterodimers (Figure 1B; orange and black dashes) whereas the TMDs are assembled as a 1b-2B-1b-2B hetero-tetramer with pseudo-4-fold symmetry with the channel gate formed by the GluN1b-M3 and GluN2B-M3′ helices. Importantly, 3D classification showed three major structures with distinct conformations, which we named “Non-active1,” “Non-active2,” and “Active,” with particle distributions of approximately 41%, 40.5%, and 18.5%, respectively (Figure S1). The major differences among these 3D classes are the following: (1) subunit arrangement within the GluN1b-GluN2B ATD heterodimers, which can be represented by the distance between GluN1b Lys178 and GluN2B Asn184 in the R2 lobes (α4′-α5 distance) (Figure 1D); (2) relative orientation of the two GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers, which can be represented by the distance between GluN1b Arg510 in loop1 (L1′) and GluN2B Leu425 in loop2 (L2) in the D1 lobes (L1′-L2 distance) (Figure 1D); and (3) the relative tension of the LBD-M3′ linker of the GluN2B subunits, which directly affects the channel gate and can be measured by the distance between the two GluN2B Gln662 residues from the two GluN2B subunits (Figure 1E). Based on the above criteria, the three 3D classes were extensively compared to one another (Figure 2). Moving from the “Non-active1” to the “Non-active2” conformation, the GluN2B ATD clam shell opens by ∼5° but otherwise the structures share similar subunit arrangements in the ATDs (Figure 2A), LBDs (Figure 2B), and TMD, with a closed channel gate (Figures 2C and 2D). In the “Active” conformation, each pair of the GluN1b-GluN2B ATD heterodimers rotate by ∼9° compared with those in “Non-active1” caused by reorientation of GluN2B ATD with respect to GluN1b ATD (Figure 2A). This is subsequently translated to a “rolling up” motion of the GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers (Figure 2B). This “Active” conformation can be trapped by inter-GluN1b-GluN2B subunit cross-linking at either the ATD or LBD by engineered disulfide bonds (“Active-SS”) or by methanethiosulfonate crosslinks designed on the basis of our previous low resolution structure, and they both result in upregulation of ion channel activity (Esmenjaud et al., 2019Esmenjaud J.B.

The cryo-EM density for the “Active” class was weaker especially at the LBD-TMD linker region because of small particle numbers than the other classes. To overcome this issue, we conducted single particle cryo-EM on the aforementioned mutant construct, “Active-SS,” harboring the GluN1b-Glu719Cys and GluN2B-Leu795Cys mutations (Esmenjaud et al., 2019Esmenjaud J.B. Stroebel D. Chan K. Grand T. David M. Wollmuth L.P. Taly A. Paoletti P. An inter-dimer allosteric switch controls NMDA receptor activity.EMBO J. 2019; 38: e99894Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) at the dimer of the GluN1b-GluN2B heterodimers interface in the LBD-layer (Figure 2B, red dashed circle in “Active-SS”; Table S1). This mutant was previously shown to increase equilibrium open probability by 2.5-fold with significant rise in mean open time (Esmenjaud et al., 2019Esmenjaud J.B. Stroebel D. Chan K. Grand T. David M. Wollmuth L.P. Taly A. Paoletti P. An inter-dimer allosteric switch controls NMDA receptor activity.EMBO J. 2019; 38: e99894Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) likely by stabilizing the conformation similar to the “Active” class above. Imaging of the “Active-SS” sample required usage of gold-coated holey grids, because they had a higher tendency to adhere to a carbon layer than the wild-type (WT) samples. Although the particle orientation for the WT samples was dominated by side views that for the “Active-SS” sample equally contained both top and side views (Figure S2). Nevertheless, our single particle analysis shows an increased population of a 3D class similar in conformation to the “Active” 3D class but with an increase in resolution from 4.4 Å to 3.6 Å and improved cryo-EM density (Figure S2). In this structure, the subunit rotation of 11° in the ATD is more pronounced than the “Active” conformation (Figure 2A), which is coupled to the “rolling up” of the GluN1b-GluN2B LBD heterodimers (Figure 2B) and pulling of the LBD-M3′ linkers from the GluN2B subunits to opposite directions (Figures 2C and 2D). Consequently, GluN2B-Ile655 from the two GluN2B subunits at the channel gate is pulled apart to open the gate (Figures 2D and S3; Video S1). The extent of gate opening is similar to that observed in the “Pre-open” state of the GluA2 AMPA receptor complexed to glutamate and cone snail toxins (Chen et al., 2014Chen L. Dürr K.L. Gouaux E. X-ray structures of AMPA receptor-cone snail toxin complexes illuminate activation mechanism.Science. 2014; 345: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) but is not as open as agonist bound GluA2 AMPA receptors complexes with the auxiliary subunit Stargazin (Chen et al., 2017Chen S.

Most PLP1 mutations, including point mutations and supernumerary copy variants, lead to severe and fatal disease. Patients who lack PLP1 expression, and Plp1-null mice, can display comparatively mild phenotypes, suggesting that PLP1 suppression might provide a general therapeutic strategy for PMD1,3-5. Here we show, using CRISPR-Cas9 to suppress Plp1 expression in the jimpy (Plp1jp) point-mutation mouse model of severe PMD, increased myelination and restored nerve conduction velocity, motor function and lifespan of the mice to wild-type levels. To evaluate the translational potential of this strategy, we identified antisense oligonucleotides that stably decrease the levels of Plp1 mRNA and PLP protein throughout the neuraxis in vivo. Administration of a single dose of Plp1-targeting antisense oligonucleotides in postnatal jimpy mice fully restored oligodendrocyte numbers, increased myelination, improved motor performance, normalized respiratory function and extended lifespan up to an eight-month end point. These results suggest that PLP1 suppression could be developed as a treatment for PMD in humans. More broadly, we demonstrate that oligonucleotide-based therapeutic agents can be delivered to oligodendrocytes in vivo to modulate neurological function and lifespan, establishing a new pharmaceutical modality for myelin disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3038881037,"Self-renewing embryonic stem cells (ESCs) respond to environmental cues by exiting pluripotency or entering a quiescent state. The molecular basis underlying this fate choice remains unclear. Here, we show that histone acetyltransferase MOF plays a critical role in this process through directly activating fatty acid oxidation (FAO) in the ground-state ESCs. We further show that the ground-state ESCs particularly rely on elevated FAO for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and energy production. Mof deletion or FAO inhibition induces bona fide quiescent ground-state ESCs with an intact core pluripotency network and transcriptome signatures akin to the diapaused epiblasts in vivo. Mechanistically, MOF/FAO inhibition acts through reducing mitochondrial respiration (i.e., OXPHOS), which in turn triggers reversible pluripotent quiescence specifically in the ground-state ESCs. The inhibition of FAO/OXPHOS also induces quiescence in naive human ESCs. Our study suggests a general function of the MOF/FAO/OXPHOS axis in regulating cell fate determination in stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W3038865079,"Background E-science technologies have significantly increased the availability of data. Research grant providers such as the European Union increasingly require open access publishing of research results and data. However, despite its significance to research, the adoption rate of open data technology remains low across all disciplines, especially in Europe where research has primarily focused on technical solutions (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework) or considered only parts of the issue. Methods and findings In this study, we emphasized the non-technical factors perceived value and uncertainty factors in the context of academia, which impact researchers’ acceptance of open data–the idea that researchers should not only publish their findings in the form of articles or reports, but also share the corresponding raw data sets. We present the results of a broad quantitative analysis including N = 995 researchers from 13 large to medium-sized universities in Germany. In order to test 11 hypotheses regarding researchers’ intentions to share their data, as well as detect any hierarchical or disciplinary differences, we employed a structured equation model (SEM) following the partial least squares (PLS) modeling approach. Conclusions Grounded in the value-based theory, this article proclaims that most individuals in academia embrace open data when the perceived advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Furthermore, uncertainty factors impact the perceived value (consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages) of sharing research data. We found that researchers’ assumptions about effort required during the data preparation process were diminished by awareness of e-science technologies (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework), which also increased their tendency to perceive personal benefits via data exchange. Uncertainty factors seem to influence the intention to share data. Effects differ between disciplines and hierarchical levels."
https://openalex.org/W3039444660,"Nav1.6 is the primary voltage-gated sodium channel isoform expressed in mature axon initial segments and nodes, making it critical for initiation and propagation of neuronal impulses. Thus, Nav1.6 modulation and dysfunction may have profound effects on input-output properties of neurons in normal and pathological conditions. Phosphorylation is a powerful and reversible mechanism regulating ion channel function. Because Nav1.6 and the multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) are independently linked to excitability disorders, we sought to investigate modulation of Nav1.6 function by CaMKII signaling. We show that inhibition of CaMKII, a Ser/Thr protein kinase associated with excitability, synaptic plasticity, and excitability disorders, with the CaMKII-specific peptide inhibitor CN21 reduces transient and persistent currents in Nav1.6-expressing Purkinje neurons by 87%. Using whole-cell voltage clamp of Nav1.6, we show that CaMKII inhibition in ND7/23 and HEK293 cells significantly reduces transient and persistent currents by 72% and produces a 5.8-mV depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation. Immobilized peptide arrays and nanoflow LC-electrospray ionization/MS of Nav1.6 reveal potential sites of CaMKII phosphorylation, specifically Ser-561 and Ser-641/Thr-642 within the first intracellular loop of the channel. Using site-directed mutagenesis to test multiple potential sites of phosphorylation, we show that Ala substitutions of Ser-561 and Ser-641/Thr-642 recapitulate the depolarizing shift in activation and reduction in current density. Computational simulations to model effects of CaMKII inhibition on Nav1.6 function demonstrate dramatic reductions in spontaneous and evoked action potentials in a Purkinje cell model, suggesting that CaMKII modulation of Nav1.6 may be a powerful mechanism to regulate neuronal excitability. Nav1.6 is the primary voltage-gated sodium channel isoform expressed in mature axon initial segments and nodes, making it critical for initiation and propagation of neuronal impulses. Thus, Nav1.6 modulation and dysfunction may have profound effects on input-output properties of neurons in normal and pathological conditions. Phosphorylation is a powerful and reversible mechanism regulating ion channel function. Because Nav1.6 and the multifunctional Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) are independently linked to excitability disorders, we sought to investigate modulation of Nav1.6 function by CaMKII signaling. We show that inhibition of CaMKII, a Ser/Thr protein kinase associated with excitability, synaptic plasticity, and excitability disorders, with the CaMKII-specific peptide inhibitor CN21 reduces transient and persistent currents in Nav1.6-expressing Purkinje neurons by 87%. Using whole-cell voltage clamp of Nav1.6, we show that CaMKII inhibition in ND7/23 and HEK293 cells significantly reduces transient and persistent currents by 72% and produces a 5.8-mV depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation. Immobilized peptide arrays and nanoflow LC-electrospray ionization/MS of Nav1.6 reveal potential sites of CaMKII phosphorylation, specifically Ser-561 and Ser-641/Thr-642 within the first intracellular loop of the channel. Using site-directed mutagenesis to test multiple potential sites of phosphorylation, we show that Ala substitutions of Ser-561 and Ser-641/Thr-642 recapitulate the depolarizing shift in activation and reduction in current density.

The voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) family is a class of ion channels that is critical for generating and propagating action potentials (AP). Navs are large heteromultimeric protein complexes that are formed by α subunits, which are the functional pore-forming subunits of the channel, and one or more auxiliary β subunits. Sodium channel α subunits are encoded by 10 genes that control expression in various excitable cells (1Catterall W.A. Voltage-gated sodium channels at 60: structure, function and pathophysiology.J. Physiol. 2012; 590 (22473783): 2577-258910.1113/jphysiol.2011.224204Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In the brain, the isoform Nav1.6 is critical for regulating and maintaining neuronal excitability (2O'Brien J.E. Meisler M.H. Sodium channel SCN8A (Nav1.6): properties and de novo mutations in epileptic encephalopathy and intellectual disability.Front. Genet. 2013; 4 (24194747): 21310.3389/fgene.2013.00213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nav1.6 is unique both in its expression pattern and biophysical properties. In adult neurons, Nav1.6 is predominantly expressed at the axon initial segment (AIS), the proximal unmyelinated region of the neuron where APs are initiated (3Hu W. Tian C. Li T. Yang M. Hou H. Shu Y. Distinct contributions of Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 in action potential initiation and backpropagation.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12 (19633666): 996-100210.1038/nn.2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and at nodes of Ranvier, where APs are propagated down the axon (3Hu W. Tian C. Li T. Yang M. Hou H. Shu Y. Distinct contributions of Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 in action potential initiation and backpropagation.Nat.

This provides Nav1.6 with significant control of AP initiation as well as propagation of neuronal impulses (3Hu W. Tian C. Li T. Yang M. Hou H. Shu Y.

Furthermore, Nav1.6 displays unique biophysical properties that enable the channel to exert powerful tuning capabilities of these impulses. For example, Nav1.6 can generate large persistent currents (6Patel R.R. Barbosa C. Brustovetsky T. Brustovetsky N. Cummins T.R.

To this end, CaMKII inhibition has been shown to reduce excitability of small and medium trigeminal ganglion neurons in addition to decreasing sodium current amplitude (48Liang R. Liu X. Wei L.

Moreover, CaMKII inhibition also reduces sodium current amplitude in cerebellar granule cells (49Carlier E. Dargent B. De Waard M. Couraud F.

These studies suggest that CaMKII signaling may play a major role in neuronal excitability, possibly through modulation of Nav1.6 sodium currents. In this study, we directly investigate the potential for CaMKII to phosphorylate and modulate Nav1.6. Multiple biochemical approaches, including MS and immobilized peptide arrays, were used to identify CaMKII phosphorylation sites on Nav1.6, and whole-cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology was used to examine the functional effects of this phosphorylation on channel biophysical properties. Using computational simulations, we further sought to examine how functional changes in Nav1.6 induced by CaMKII modulation may impact spontaneous and evoked AP initiation in neurons. Electrophysiological recordings of bulk sodium currents from trigeminal neurons and cerebellar granule cells show significantly decreased transient sodium currents following CaMKII inhibition with KN93 or KN62 (48Liang R.

To further explore the potential for CaMKII to regulate sodium currents in neurons, we recorded from Purkinje cells incubated with the CaMKII inhibitor CN21 conjugated to the tat cell–penetrating motif (tatCN21) or its inactive analog tatCN21Ala (50Ashpole N.M. Hudmon A. Excitotoxic neuroprotection and vulnerability with CaMKII inhibition.Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2011; 46 (21316454): 720-73010.1016/j.mcn.2011.02.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sodium currents from Purkinje cells treated with no peptide (left), tatCN21 (middle), or tatCN21Ala (right) were elicited with a series of depolarizing steps ranging from −100 to +15 mV for 50 ms from a holding potential of −100 mV (Fig. 1A). Application of tatCN21 to inhibit CaMKII significantly reduced transient sodium current density by 87% (Fig. 1C) in Purkinje neurons compared with no peptide or tatCN21Ala-treated cells. We also examined persistent current generation in Purkinje neurons in the context of CaMKII inhibition by using the same depolarizing step protocol as described above. Persistent current is a noninactivating, or very slowly inactivating, sodium current and was measured at the end of the current trace (Fig. 1B). These currents are known to amplify subthreshold inputs and mediate repetitive action potential firing (9Kole M.H. Stuart G.J. Is action potential threshold lowest in the axon?.Nat.

In addition to decreasing transient sodium currents in Purkinje neurons, CaMKII inhibition with tatCN21 also reduces persistent current density (Fig. 1D). Current densities were calculated by normalizing the current amplitude at −25 mV by the cell capacitance. We used −25 mV for transient and persistent sodium current measurements to minimize clamp error artifacts during analysis. We did not determine the impact of CaMKII inhibition on Purkinje neuron sodium current voltage dependence because of issues with space-clamp errors. Because Nav1.6 is the predominant sodium current observed in Purkinje neurons (53Schaller K.L. Caldwell J.H. Expression and distribution of voltage-gated sodium channels in the cerebellum.Cerebellum. 2003; 2 (12882229): 2-910.1080/14734220309424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), these data suggest that Nav1.6 may be a substrate for CaMKII and modulated by CaMKII signaling. While Nav1.6 is the predominant sodium current in Purkinje neurons (53Schaller K.L. Caldwell J.H. Expression and distribution of voltage-gated sodium channels in the cerebellum.Cerebellum. 2003; 2 (12882229): 2-910.1080/14734220309424Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the expression of another tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive voltage-gated sodium channel isoform (e.g. Nav1.1) in Purkinje neurons could contaminate our recordings. The TTX metabolite 4,9-anhydro-TTX has been reported to selectively target Nav1.6 sodium currents (54Rosker C. Lohberger B. Hofer D. Steinecker B. Quasthoff S. Schreibmayer W. The TTX metabolite 4,9-anhydro-TTX is a highly specific blocker of the Nav1.6 voltage-dependent sodium channel.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293 (17522141): C783-C78910.1152/ajpcell.00070.2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, recent evidence shows that 4,9-anhydro-TTX also blocks Nav1.1 currents at similar concentrations required to block Nav1.6 activity (55Griffith T.N. Docter T.A. Lumpkin E.A. Tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium channels mediate action potential firing and excitability in menthol-sensitive Vglut3-lineage sensory neurons.J.

Therefore, we turned to a heterologous expression system, where the role of CaMKII in modulating Nav1.6 sodium currents could be explored without significant contamination from other endogenous voltage-gated sodium channel isoforms. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained in neuronal ND7/23 cells transiently co-transfected with GFP (positive selection) and a tetrodotoxin-resistant (TTX-R) form (Y371S point mutation) of the human Nav1.6 channel that makes Nav1.6 resistant to TTX, yet does not appear to alter its biophysical properties (56Herzog R.I.

In this system, TTX can be used to block endogenous currents, allowing TTX-R Nav1.6 current to be effectively studied in isolation. Space- and voltage-clamp errors are also more effectively controlled in ND7/23 cells. The CaMKII peptide inhibitor CN21 or its inactive analog, CN21Ala, was included in the patch pipette. Whereas we observed 15.9 ± 1.9% autonomously active CaMKII in our cultured ND7/23 cells (see “Experimental procedures”), we also included Ca2+ and calmodulin in the patch pipette to promote further activation of endogenous CaMKII as described previously (57Ashpole N.M.

Here, we confirm that TREM2 mutation attenuates microglial migration. Then, using Trem2-/- mice and an R47H variant mouse model for AD generated for this study, we show that TREM2 deficiency or the AD-associated R47H mutation results in inhibition of FAK and Rac1/Cdc42-GTPase signaling critical for cell migration. Intriguingly, treatment with CN04, a Rac1/Cdc42-GTPase activator, partially enhances microglial migration in response to oligomeric Aβ42 in Trem2-/- or R47H microglia both in vitro and in vivo. Our study shows that the dysfunction of microglial migration in the AD-associated TREM2 R47H variant is caused by FAK/Rac1/Cdc42 signaling disruption, and that activation of this signaling ameliorates impaired microglial migration response to Aβ42 , suggesting a therapeutic target for R47H-bearing patients with high risk of AD."

They play a crucial role in plant defense against phytopathogens by inhibiting microbial polygalacturonases (PGs). PGs hydrolyze the cell wall polysaccharide pectin and are among the first enzymes to be secreted during plant infection. Recent studies demonstrated that herbivorous insects express their own PG multi-gene families, raising the question whether PGIPs also inhibit insect PGs and protect plants from herbivores. Preliminary evidence suggested that PGIPs may negatively influence larval growth of the leaf beetle Phaedon cochleariae (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and identified BrPGIP3 from Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) as a candidate. PGIPs are predominantly studied in planta because their heterologous expression in microbial systems is problematic and instability and aggregation of recombinant PGIPs has complicated in vitro inhibition assays. To minimize aggregate formation, we heterologously expressed BrPGIP3 fused to a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor, immobilizing it on the extracellular surface of insect cells. We demonstrated that BrPGIP3_GPI inhibited several P. cochleariae PGs in vitro, providing the first direct evidence of an interaction between a plant PGIP and an animal PG.

https://openalex.org/W3038494663,"Advances in computer and communications technology have deeply affected the way we communicate. Social media have emerged as a major means of human communication. However, a major limitation in such media is the lack of non-verbal stimuli, which sometimes hinders the understanding of the message, and in particular the associated emotional content. In an effort to compensate for this, people started to use emoticons, which are combinations of keyboard characters that resemble facial expressions, and more recently their evolution: emojis, namely, small colorful images that resemble faces, actions and daily life objects. This paper presents evidence of the effect of emojis on memory retrieval through a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study. A total number of fifteen healthy volunteers were recruited for the experiment, during which successive stimuli were presented, containing words with intense emotional content combined with emojis, either with congruent or incongruent emotional content. Volunteers were asked to recall a memory related to the stimulus. The study of the reaction times showed that emotional incongruity among word+emoji combinations led to longer reaction times in memory retrieval compared to congruent combinations. General Linear Model (GLM) and Blind Source Separation (BSS) methods have been tested in assessing the influence of the emojis on the process of memory retrieval. The analysis of the fMRI data showed that emotional incongruity among word+emoji combinations activated the Broca’s area (BA44 and BA45) in both hemispheres, the Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and the inferior prefrontal cortex (BA47), compared to congruent combinations. Furthermore, compared to pseudowords, word+emoji combinations activated the left Broca’s area (BA44 and BA45), the amygdala, the right temporal pole (BA48) and several frontal regions including the SMA and the inferior prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W3038749713,"Introduction The re-emergence of vector borne diseases affecting millions of people in recent years has drawn attention to arboviruses globally. Here, we report on the sero-prevalence of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), mayaro virus (MAYV) and zika virus (ZIKV) in a swamp community in Zambia. Methods We collected blood and saliva samples from residents of Lukanga swamps in 2016 during a mass-cholera vaccination campaign. Over 10,000 residents were vaccinated with two doses of Shanchol™ during this period. The biological samples were collected prior to vaccination (baseline) and at specified time points after vaccination. We tested a total of 214 baseline stored serum samples for IgG antibodies against NS1 of DENV and ZIKV and E2 of CHIKV and MAYV on ELISA. We defined sero-prevalence as the proportion of participants with optical density (OD) values above a defined cut-off value, determined using a finite mixture model. Results Of the 214 participants, 79 (36.9%; 95% CI 30.5–43.8) were sero-positive for Chikungunya; 23 (10.8%; 95% CI 6.9–15.7) for Zika, 36 (16.8%; 95% CI 12.1–22.5) for Dengue and 42 (19.6%; 95% CI 14.5–25.6) for Mayaro. Older participants were more likely to have Zika virus whilst those involved with fishing activities were at greater risk of contracting Chikungunya virus. Among all the antigens tested, we also found that Chikungunya saliva antibody titres correlated with baseline serum titres (Spearman’s correlation coefficient = 0.222; p = 0.03). Conclusion Arbovirus transmission is occurring in Zambia. This requires proper screening tools as well as surveillance data to accurately report on disease burden in Zambia."
https://openalex.org/W3040023736,"Rhipicephalus microplus is recognized as a tick species highly prevalent in cattle, with a wide pantropical distribution that seems to continue spreading geographically. However, its role as a biological vector has been scarcely studied in the livestock context. In this study, a 16S rRNA next-generation sequencing analysis was used to determine bacterial diversity in salivary glands and gut of R. microplus from two contrasting livestock agroecosystems in Antioquia, Colombia. Both the culture-independent approach (CI) and the culture-dependent (CD) approach were complementarily adopted in this study. A total of 341 unique OTUs were assigned, the richness showed to be higher in the Northern than in the Middle Magdalena region, and a high diversity was found at the phylum and genus levels in the samples obtained. With the CI approach, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the most common phylum of bacteria regardless of the organ, or geographic origin of the specimens analyzed. While the relative abundance of bacteria at a phylum level with the CD approach varied between analyzed samples, the data obtained suggest that a high diversity of species of bacteria occurs in R. microplus from both livestock agroecosystems. Bacterial genera such as Anaplasma, Coxiella, and Ehrlichia, recognized for their implications in tick-borne diseases, were also detected, together with endosymbionts such as Lysinibacillus, previously reported as a potential tool for biological control. This information is useful to deepen the knowledge about microbial diversity regarding the relations between endosymbionts and pathogens and could facilitate the future development of epidemiological surveillance in livestock systems."
https://openalex.org/W3040639806,"The transcription factor AHR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor) drives the expression of genes involved in detoxification pathways in cells exposed to pollutants and other small molecules. Moreover, AHR supports transcriptional programs that promote ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis in cells stimulated to proliferate by the oncoprotein MYC. Thus, AHR is necessary for the proliferation of MYC-overexpressing cells. To define metabolic pathways in which AHR cooperates with MYC in supporting cell growth, here we used LC–MS–based metabolomics to examine the metabolome of MYC-expressing cells upon AHR knockdown. We found that AHR knockdown reduced lactate, S-lactoylglutathione, N-acetyl-l-alanine, 2-hydroxyglutarate, and UMP levels. Using our previously obtained RNA sequencing data, we found that AHR mediates the expression of the UMP-generating enzymes dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (quinone) (DHODH) and uridine monophosphate synthetase (UMPS), as well as lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), establishing a mechanism by which AHR regulates lactate and UMP production in MYC-overexpressing cells. AHR knockdown in glioblastoma cells also reduced the expression of LDHA (and lactate), DHODH, and UMPS but did not affect UMP levels, likely because of compensatory mechanisms in these cells.

Recently, our laboratory discovered that MYC promotes the expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) (15Lafita-Navarro M.C. Kim M. Borenstein-Auerbach N. Venkateswaran N. Hao Y.H. Ray R.

AHR is a cytoplasmic receptor that responds to exogenous ligands, such as the pollutant 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (16Denison M.S. Nagy S.R.

In the presence of its ligands, AHR shuttles to the nucleus where it dimerizes with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) (19Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Identification of the Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) as a component of the DNA binding form of the Ah receptor.Science. 1992; 256 (1317062): 1193-119510.1126/science.256.5060.1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) to bind to DNA and activate the expression of genes that contain xenobiotic responsive elements (XREs) in their promoters including genes involved in detoxification such as CYP1A1 (20Rothhammer V.

We found that AHR also regulates the expression of a subset of genes that are necessary for the growth of MYC-expressing cells such as NOLC1 and OGFOD1, which are involved in rRNA production and protein synthesis (15Lafita-Navarro M.C.

To determine the contribution of AHR to metabolic pathways regulated by MYC, we performed metabolomics of rat1 fibroblasts myc−/− with or without MYC upon AHR knockdown. By combining metabolomics and transcriptomics, we found that AHR contributes to the regulation of glycolysis and the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway in MYC-expressing cells. In addition, to identify metabolic pathways supported by AHR in glioblastoma (GBM), an aggressive brain tumor dependent on AHR (18Opitz C.A. Litzenburger U.M. Sahm F. Ott M. Tritschler I. Trump S. Schumacher T. Jestaedt L. Schrenk D. Weller M. Jugold M. Guillemin G.J. Miller C.L. Lutz C. Radlwimmer B. et al.An endogenous tumour-promoting ligand of the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor.Nature. 2011; 478 (21976023): 197-20310.1038/nature10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), we examined the metabolome of GBM cells upon AHR knockdown and found that AHR knockdown affected several metabolic pathways in these cells. To define AHR-regulated metabolic pathways downstream of MYC, we performed an LC–MS metabolomics screening in the myc −/− rat fibroblasts HO15.19 that were stably reconstituted by retroviral infection of MYC or empty vector, in which AHR was silenced for 48 h, using two different siRNA (each in triplicate) (Fig. 1, A and B). Although AHR knockdown was efficient 48 h after AHR siRNA transfection, cell proliferation was modestly affected (15Lafita-Navarro M.C. Kim M. Borenstein-Auerbach N. Venkateswaran N. Hao Y.H. Ray R. Brabletz T. Scaglioni P.P. Shay J.W. Conacci-Sorrell M. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates nucleolar activity and protein synthesis in MYC-expressing cells.Genes Dev. 2018; 32 (30254109): 1303-130810.1101/gad.313007.118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), making this an appropriate time point to identify metabolic events that cause reduced cell growth. We first defined the metabolic signature regulated by MYC by comparing the abundance of metabolites in myc −/− fibroblasts expressing MYC and myc −/− expressing empty vector using a cutoff p value of ≤0.05. MYC regulated the abundance of 64 metabolites (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1), including metabolites in pathways previously attributed to MYC function such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, and nucleotide biosynthesis (3Stine Z.E. Walton Z.E. Altman B.J. Hsieh A.L. Dang C.V. MYC, metabolism, and cancer.Cancer Discov. 2015; 5 (26382145): 1024-103910.1158/2159-8290.CD-15-0507Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). To identify AHR-mediated metabolic changes in the MYC-expressing cells, we considered the metabolites for which abundance was affected with both AHR siRNAs using a cutoff p value of ≤0.01. AHR knockdown altered the levels of 10 metabolites in the myc−/− fibroblasts reconstituted with MYC (Fig. 1C and Figs. S2, A and B). Five of the ten metabolites were induced by MYC and reduced upon AHR knockdown, suggesting that MYC depended on AHR to increase the abundance of those metabolites (Fig. 1, D and E). AHR knockdown also altered the abundance of seven metabolites in the myc−/− fibroblasts (Fig. S2, C and D). With the goal of identifying novel AHR-mediated, growth-promoting pathways, we focused this study on the metabolites increased by MYC and decreased by AHR knockdown. The five metabolites affected by AHR knockdown in MYC-expressing cells were lactate, S-lactoylglutathione, N-acetyl-l-alanine, 2-hydroxyglutarate, and UMP (Fig. 1, E and F). Lactate is the end product of glycolysis and therefore is used as a readout of glycolytic activity (3Stine Z.E. Walton Z.E. Altman B.J. Hsieh A.L. Dang C.V. MYC, metabolism, and cancer.Cancer Discov. 2015; 5 (26382145): 1024-103910.1158/2159-8290.CD-15-0507Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). S-lactoylglutathione is metabolized by glyoxalase II through the glyoxalase system, producing the antioxidant GSH and lactate in the mitochondria (23Armeni T. Cianfruglia L. Piva F. Urbanelli L. Luisa Caniglia M. Pugnaloni A. Principato G. S-d-Lactoylglutathione can be an alternative supply of mitochondrial glutathione.Free Radic. Biol.

UMP can be produced by metabolizing ribose-5-phosphate through the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway or by phosphorylating uridine through the salvage pathway (24Van Rompay A.R. Norda A. Lindén K. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine nucleoside analogs by two human uridine-cytidine kinases.Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59 (11306702): 1181-118610.1124/mol.59.5.1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). UMP gives rise to other pyrimidines such as UTP, CTP, and TTP, which are needed for RNA and DNA synthesis (25Lane A.N. Fan T.W. Regulation of mammalian nucleotide metabolism and biosynthesis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25628363): 2466-248510.1093/nar/gkv047Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Our experiment did not distinguish between the two 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) enantiomers, d-2HG or l-2HG (26Intlekofer A.M. Wang B. Liu H. Shah H. Carmona-Fontaine C. Rustenburg A.S. Salah S. Gunner M.R. Chodera J.D. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. l-2-Hydroxyglutarate production arises from noncanonical enzyme function at acidic pH.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 (28263965): 494-50010.1038/nchembio.2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). d-2HG is a reduced form of α-ketoglutarate produced by the aberrant activity of the mutant enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (mutIDH1/2) present in cancer cells (27Molenaar R.J. Maciejewski J.P. Wilmink J.W. van Noorden C.J.F.

However, IDH1/2 were not mutated in the rat fibroblast used in this experiment. d-2HG can be produced/accumulated by additional mechanisms such as decreased expression of d-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (28Ye D. Guan K.L. Xiong Y. Metabolism, activity, and targeting of d- and l-2-hydroxyglutarates.Trends Cancer. 2018; 4 (29458964): 151-16510.1016/j.trecan.2017.12.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or increased expression of ADHFE1 (alcohol dehydrogenase iron-containing 1) (29Mishra P.

Because of their ability to inhibit hydroxylases such as the Jumonji histone demethylases, the TET cytosine demethylases, and other prolyl hydroxylases, d- and l-2-HG are known as oncometabolites (33Reiter-Brennan C. Semmler L. Klein A. The effects of 2-hydroxyglutarate on the tumorigenesis of gliomas.Contemp. Oncol. (Pozn.). 2018; 22 (30783384): 215-22210.5114/wo.2018.82642PubMed Google Scholar). Using our previously published RNA-seq data, which was performed under the same conditions as the metabolomic screening (15Lafita-Navarro M.C. Kim M. Borenstein-Auerbach N. Venkateswaran N. Hao Y.H. Ray R. Brabletz T. Scaglioni P.P. Shay J.W. Conacci-Sorrell M. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates nucleolar activity and protein synthesis in MYC-expressing cells.Genes Dev. 2018; 32 (30254109): 1303-130810.1101/gad.313007.118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the expression of the enzymes directly involved in the production of the five metabolites that were induced by MYC and reduced upon AHR knockdown (Fig. 1, E and F, and Fig. S2, E–I). The mRNA levels of three genes encoding for enzymes related to the metabolites discovered in our metabolomics (Fig. 1E) were altered upon AHR knockdown. ADHFE1, which produces d-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG), was up-regulated upon AHR knockdown and thus did not align with the observed decreased in abundance of the metabolite (Fig. 1F and Fig. S2F). UMPS (Fig. S2H), which converts orotate into UMP, and LDHA (Fig. S2I), which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, were down-regulated upon AHR knockdown, which is consistent with the reduced levels of UMP and lactate, respectively (Fig. 1E). The decrease in LDHA could also account for the observed decrease in 2-HG (Fig. 1F) (26Intlekofer A.M. Wang B. Liu H. Shah H. Carmona-Fontaine C. Rustenburg A.S. Salah S. Gunner M.R. Chodera J.D. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. l-2-Hydroxyglutarate production arises from noncanonical enzyme function at acidic pH.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13 (28263965): 494-50010.1038/nchembio.2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). We validated LDHA reduction upon AHR knockdown by qPCR (Fig. S2J) and reported that the rat LDHA promoter contained MYC-binding (E-box: CACGTG) and AHR-binding (XRE: GCGTG) sites (Fig. S2K). Although there were no AHR-regulated genes that could account for the reduction in S-lactoylglutathione, 2-hydroxyglutarate, and N-acetyl-l-alanine (Fig. 1E and Fig. S2, E–H), we observed that glucose and pyruvate were also lower upon AHR silencing in MYC-expressing cells (Fig. S3B). Because S-lactoylglutathione, 2-hydroxyglutarate, and N-acetyl-l-alanine are derived from glycolytic intermediates (Fig. 1, E and F), a decrease in glucose and pyruvate could contribute, at least in part, to their lower abundance upon AHR knockdown (Fig. 1E). Our RNA-seq data indicated that AHR knockdown caused a modest reduction in the mRNA levels of additional glycolytic (ALDOA, GAPDH, PGK1, and ENO1) (Fig. S3C) and TCA cycle (ACO2, IDH1, and MDH2) enzymes (Fig. S4C). The glycolytic products of those enzymes were not detected in our metabolomics screening, likely because of their low abundance in these samples. Moreover, the levels of the products of those TCA cycle enzymes did not change upon AHR knockdown. It is possible that compensatory mechanisms maintained the levels of most TCA intermediates upon AHR knockdown. UMP can be synthesized through the salvage pathway in which nucleotides are recycled by either phosphorylating/dephosphorylating reactions or the de novo pathway in which ribose-5-phosphate and amino acids are processed by the enzymes CAD, DHODH, and UMPS (Fig. 2A). CAD and DHODH were previously found to be up-regulated by MYC (6Eberhardy S.R. Farnham P.J. c-Myc mediates activation of the cad promoter via a post-RNA polymerase II recruitment mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 (11673469): 48562-4857110.1074/jbc.M109014200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Our RNA-seq data indicated that although the expression of the genes involved in the salvage pathway were not affected by AHR knockdown, mRNA levels of CAD, DHODH, and UMPS were reduced upon AHR knockdown (Fig. 2B and Fig. S4E). These data and our metabolomic data showing a decrease in UMP (Fig. 1E) suggest that the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway is regulated by AHR. Because AHR silencing decreased the expression of the enzymes involved in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, we further examined the role of AHR in the regulation of this pathway. Bioinformatic analysis of the rat CAD, DHODH, and UMPS promoter regions within ± 1 kb of the transcription start site showed that all three genes have one MYC-binding site and that DHODH and UMPS, but not CAD, have several AHR-binding sites (Fig. 3E). Supporting these data, DHODH and UMPS mRNA levels were significantly lower than those of CAD in MYC-expressing cells upon AHR silencing (Fig. 2D). DHODH and UMPS protein levels were also reduced 72 h after AHR silencing (Fig. 2, E and F). Altogether, these data suggest that AHR regulates the transcription of DHODH and UMPS and to a lesser extent CAD. The nucleoside uridine can be converted into UMP and vice versa (Fig. 2A) (25Lane A.N. Fan T.W. Regulation of mammalian nucleotide metabolism and biosynthesis.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43 (25628363): 2466-248510.1093/nar/gkv047Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Our metabolomics screening indicated that uridine abundance was not affected by AHR knockdown (Fig. 2G), thus suggesting that the uridine pool could be maintained by the import of extracellular uridine (Fig. 2H). Interestingly, of the six nucleoside transporters (Fig. 2H): concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNT1–3 encoded by SLC28A1–3) and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1–3 encoded by SLC29A1–3) (34Pastor-Anglada M. Perez-Torras S. Emerging roles of nucleoside transporters.Front. Pharmacol. 2018; 9 (29928232): 60610.3389/fphar.2018.00606Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the expression of SLC29A1(ENT1) was elevated by MYC and further induced upon AHR knockdown (Fig. 2I). SLC29A2 (ENT2) was also elevated in the MYC-expressing cells but was not affected by AHR knockdown (Fig. 2I). These data suggest that when the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis is impaired by AHR silencing, cells attempt to maintain the intracellular pyrimidine pool by importing uridine from the extracellular environment to compensate for the reduction in the de novo biosynthesis of UMP. The RNA-seq data derived from grade II, III, and IV/GBM patient data deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) databases indicated that the expression of AHR positively correlated with higher grade gliomas (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, AHR, DHODH, and UMPS protein levels were higher in the SF188 and LN229 GBM cells than in the nontransformed human immortalized p14/ARF−/− astrocytes (cell of origin of GBM) (Fig. 3B). The expression of ARNT (AHR heterodimeric partner (19Reyes H. Reisz-Porszasz S. Hankinson O. Identification of the Ah receptor nuclear translocator protein (Arnt) as a component of the DNA binding form of the Ah receptor.Science. 1992; 256 (1317062): 1193-119510.1126/science.256.5060.1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar)), MYC, and MAX (MYC heterodimeric partner (35Blackwood E.M. Eisenman R.N. Max: a helix-loop-helix zipper protein that forms a sequence-specific DNA-binding complex with Myc.Science. 1991; 251 (2006410): 1211-121710.1126/science.2006410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1473) Google Scholar)) in gliomas did not consistently correlate with disease grade (Fig. S5, A and B). In agreement with data from previous studies (18Opitz C.A. Litzenburger U.M. Sahm F. Ott M. Tritschler I. Trump S. Schumacher T. Jestaedt L. Schrenk D. Weller M. Jugold M. Guillemin G.J. Miller C.L. Lutz C. Radlwimmer B. et al.An endogenous tumour-promoting ligand of the human aryl hydrocarbon receptor.Nature. 2011; 478 (21976023): 197-20310.1038/nature10491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar), our data showed that the proliferation of the GBM cells SF188 and LN229 was reduced upon infection with AHR shRNA-containing lentiviral particles (Fig. 3, C and D). This was due to cell cycle arrest, as indicated by higher levels of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 and lower levels of the cell cycle protein cyclin A1, as well as to the activation of apoptosis as shown by an increase in cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (Fig. S5C). Bioinformatic analysis of the human CAD, DHODH, and UMPS promoter regions within ± 1 kb of the transcription start site found that these genes exhibited MYC- and AHR-binding sites (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, ChIP-seq data deposited from the ENCODE database (processed with the hg19/reference genome) demonstrated that MYC significantly binds to the promoter regions of CAD, DHODH, and UMPS. AHR binds significantly to DHODH and UMPS (Fig. 3, E and F, and Fig. S6A). Even though a peak for AHR on CAD was not detected, the AHR ChIP-seq signal visualization shows an enrichment for AHR on the CAD promoter as compared with surrounding areas, suggesting that AHR binds to the promoter of CAD with lower affinity (Fig. 3, E and F, and Fig. S6A). ARNT and MAX ChIP-seq data (processed with the hg19/reference genome) indicated that MAX but not ARNT also binds to the promoter regions of CAD, DHODH, and UMPS (Fig. S6B). It is likely that MYC and MAX form a complex to bind these gene promoters. In contrast, it is possible that AHR binds to the promoter of these genes with another, unknown, partner or that the ChIP-seq for ARNT was not sensitive enough to identify ARNT-positive peaks in the CAD, DHODH, and UMPS promoters. As positive controls for AHR-ARNT and MYC-MAX, the regions of the CYP1A1 (bona fide AHR-ARNT target gene (20Rothhammer V. Quintana F.J. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor: an environmental sensor integrating immune responses in health and disease.Nat. Rev.

As expected, AHR and ARNT bind to the CYP1A1 promoter, and MYC and MAX bind to the LDHA promoter (Fig. S6B), thus validating the reliability of the ChIP-seq results. Interestingly, AHR displayed a positive peak in the LDHA promoter (Fig. S6B), which supports our metabolomic and transcriptional data on lactate (Fig. 1E) and LDHA expression (Fig. S2, I and J). Consistent with the ENCODE ChIP-seq data, our data show that DHODH and UMPS mRNA levels but not CAD mRNA levels were reduced in the SF188 and LN229 cells upon AHR knockdown with AHR shRNA-containing lentiviral particles (Fig. 3G and Fig. S5E). Moreover, ChIP experiments revealed that AHR bound to the promoter regions of DHODH and UMPS in SF188 cells (Fig. 3H). Distant regions on the DHODH and UMPS genes that did not contain XRE elements were used as negative controls. The CYP1A1 promoter, a canonical AHR target gene, was used as a positive control for AHR binding (Fig. 3H). We also confirmed that silencing AHR with siRNA reduced the levels of DHODH and UMPS, as well as the proliferation of LN229 (Fig. 3, I and J) and GBM9 cells (Fig. S5D). These data indicate that AHR regulates the expression of the enzymes involved in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in GBM cells. To define AHR-regulated metabolic pathways specific to GBM cells, we performed LC–MS metabolomics in SF188 cells infected with lentiviral particles containing two different AHR shRNAs (named 84 and 86) or a control vector (pLKO) (Fig. 4A). AHR was efficiently silenced 72 h after infection (Fig. 3B). Applying a cutoff p value of ≤0.01 in both AHR shRNA conditions, we found 26 metabolites affected by AHR knockdown in the SF188 cells (Fig. 4C). Of those, 2 of them changed inconsistently with the 2 AHR shRNAs, probably because of off-target effects, 13 of them were increased, and 11 were decreased. These metabolites were part of key pathways, such as fatty acid and nucleotide metabolism and redox equilibrium (Fig. 4D), suggesting that AHR may be involved in maintaining the metabolic homeostasis of GBM cells. We then examined the abundance of the metabolites found to be regulated by AHR in fibroblasts (Fig. 1) and found that although there was a trend toward decreased lactate, S-lactoylglutathione, d-2-hydroxyglutarate, and N-acetyl-alanine, the results were not significant with both shRNAs (Fig. 4E). Despite the decrease in DHODH and UMPS mRNA levels upon AHR knockdown (Fig. 3G), the abundance of UMP or other pyrimidine forms was not affected in SF188 cells upon AHR silencing (Fig. 4E and Fig. S7A), thus indicating that metabolic outputs should not be inferred simply based on the expression of single metabolic enzymes. Interestingly, the levels of uridine in SF188 cells were more than 10 times higher in AHR knockdown cells (Fig. S7A), which could explain why UMP and other pyrimidines levels were not affected by AHR knockdown. To investigate whether uridine was being imported from the culture media, we measured the expression of the nucleoside transporters SLC28A1–3 and SLC29A1–3 upon AHR knockdown (Fig. S7B). Unlike the results observed in the rat fibroblasts (Fig. 2I), the expression of SLC29A1 was decreased, whereas SLC29A3 was modestly increased upon AHR knockdown in SF188 cells, thus suggesting that other mechanisms, such as increased enzymatic activity of the de novo or salvage pathway, may contribute to the increase in uridine levels. The addition of uridine to the culture media did not rescue the effects of AHR knockdown in proliferation (Fig. S7, C and D), likely because of the importance of other growth-promoting pathways regulated by AHR such as protein synthesis (15Lafita-Navarro M.C. Kim M. Borenstein-Auerbach N. Venkateswaran N. Hao Y.H. Ray R. Brabletz T. Scaglioni P.P. Shay J.W. Conacci-Sorrell M. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor regulates nucleolar activity and protein synthesis in MYC-expressing cells.Genes Dev. 2018; 32 (30254109): 1303-130810.1101/gad.313007.118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because LDHA was decreased in the rat fibroblasts upon AHR knockdown (Fig. S2J) and lactate levels were decreased upon AHR knockdown in SF188 cells (Fig. 4E), we analyzed the promoter of the human LDHA. Human LDHA promoter had one XRE, which is consistent with the peak of AHR observed in the ENCODE ChIP-seq data (Fig. S6B) and with our results showing that AHR bound to the promoter of LDHA in SF188 cells (Fig. 4G). Moreover, AHR knockdown decreased LDHA mRNA levels in SF188 and LN229 cells (Fig. 4H). Based on our results, we proposed a model in which AHR cooperates with MYC to regulate metabolic pathways necessary for the rapid proliferation of MYC-transformed cells including the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway and glycolysis through the transcriptional regulation of LDHA, DHODH, and UMPS genes (Fig. 4, I and J). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. For transient transfections, the wells were seeded with 150,000 cells, and the cells were transfected with 3 μl of siRNA (20 μm) and 3 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX. The day after transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh medium. After 3 days, the cells were harvested for qPCR or stained with crystal violet to assess proliferation. For viral transduction, 50,000 cells were mixed with 10 μg/ml Polybrene and pLKO or shRNA-containing virus. After the indicated times, the cells were harvested for qPCR, metabolomic analysis, or staining with crystal violet to assess proliferation. Total RNA was extracted with TRI Reagent® solution (Sigma), and the cDNA produced with iScript RT Supermix for RT-qPCR (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed with the iTaqTM Universal SYBR® Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Expression levels for each gene were normalized to β-actin expression. For Western blots, the cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors.

The nuclei were purified and then lysed with RIPA buffer. DNA was sonicated to obtain ∼500-bp fragments. Nuclei lysates were diluted 1:10 for immunoprecipitation with AHR antibody.

Recently, we have designed synthetic cytokine receptors (SyCyRs) consisting of GFP and mCherry nanobodies fused to transmembrane and intracellular domains of cytokine receptors that phenocopy cytokine signaling induced by nonphysiological homo- and heterodimeric GFP-mCherry ligands. Interleukin 22 (IL-22) signals via both IL-22 receptor α1 (IL-22Rα1) and the common IL-10R2, belongs to the IL-10 cytokine family, and is critically involved in tissue regeneration. Here, IL-22 SyCyRs phenocopied native IL-22 signal transduction, indicated by induction of cytokine-dependent cellular proliferation, signal transduction, and transcriptome analysis. Whereas homodimeric IL-22Rα1 SyCyRs failed to activate signaling, homodimerization of the second IL-22 signaling chain, SyCyR(IL-10R2), which previously was considered not to induce signal transduction, led to induction of signal transduction. Interestingly, the SyCyR(IL-10R2) and SyCyR(IL-22Rα1) constructs could form functional heterodimeric receptor signaling complexes with the synthetic IL-6 receptor chain SyCyR(gp130). In summary, we have demonstrated that IL-22 signaling can be phenocopied by synthetic cytokine receptors, identified a functional IL-10R2 homodimeric receptor complex, and uncovered broad receptor cross-talk of IL-22Rα1 and IL-20R2 with gp130.

Cytokines control immune responses but are also involved in homeostatic processes, such as development, differentiation, growth, and regeneration. Signal transduction of cytokines is executed by natural biological switches, and among many other functions, it controls immunity-related processes (1Croxford A.L. Mair F. Becher B. IL-23: one cytokine in control of autoimmunity.Eur. J. Immunol. 2012; 42 (22949325): 2263-227310.1002/eji.201242598Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cytokines switch transmembrane receptors from the off-state into the on-state via receptor dimerization or multimerization. The on-state might be interrupted by negative feedback mechanisms or depletion of the cytokine and cytokine receptor. Recently, we have designed synthetic cytokine receptors (SyCyRs), which phenocopy IL-6 and IL-23 signaling (2Engelowski E. Schneider A. Franke M. Xu H. Clemen R. Lang A. Baran P. Binsch C. Knebel B.

The nanobodies serve as extracellular sensors for homo- and heteromeric GFP-mCherry fusion proteins, which induce receptor dimerization (5Mossner S. Phan H. Triller S. Moll J. Conrad U. Scheller J. Multimerization strategies for efficient production and purification of highly active synthetic cytokine receptor ligands.PLoS ONE. 2020; 15 (32236103)e023080410.1371/journal.pone.0230804PubMed Google Scholar). A nanobody or VHH domain consists of the N-terminal variable domain of Camelidae heavy chain antibody, which is sufficient for antigen binding (6Wesolowski J. Alzogaray V. Reyelt J. Unger M.

Synthetic cytokine receptors might become important tools for immunotherapeutic applications (7Scheller J. Engelowski E. Moll J. Floss D. Immunoreceptor engineering and synthetic cytokine signaling for therapeutics.Trends Immunol. 2019; 40 (30738638): 258-27210.1016/j.it.2019.01.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy being the first example that has been approved as gene therapy for the treatment of severe cases of acute lymphatic leukemia (8Si W.

Moreover, synthetic cytokine biology can decipher the potential of cytokine receptor cross-talk. In a reductionistic view, a cytokine binds only to its corresponding cytokine receptor complex, which is composed either of receptor homo- or heterodimers. This simple view has been challenged for many cytokines and cytokine receptors that have multiple binding partners. For example, the signal receptor complex of IL-6 consists of two gp130 receptor chains, but gp130 is also the only receptor for IL-11 and the co-receptor for IL-27, CNTF, CT-1, LIF, and OSM. On the other hand, IL-35 from the IL-12–type cytokine family was proposed to activate a variety of different receptor complexes, including gp130 homodimers, IL-12Rβ2 homodimers, and IL-12Rβ2/WSX-1 and gp130/IL-12Rβ2 heterodimers (9Collison L.W.

There are three more distantly related cytokines that are sometimes classified as IL-10 family members or as type III interferons (IFNs): IL-28A (IFN-λ2), IL-28B (IFN-λ3), and IL-20 (IFN-λ1) (14Ouyang W.

IL-22 is predominantly produced by T-cell subsets and group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) (17Wolk K. Kunz S. Asadullah K. Sabat R.

The majority of preclinical studies support a protective role for IL-22 against various pathogens, including bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites (12Ouyang W. O'Garra A.

Therefore, mimicking IL-22 signal transduction in synthetic biology is of importance for future therapeutic applications. Here, we generated and characterized synthetic cytokine receptors for IL-22, revealed a novel role of the IL-10R2 in signal transduction, and found a functional cross-talk with the IL-6 receptor chain gp130. Here, we generated SyCyRs to mimic IL-22 signaling. Naturally, IL-22 signals via a heterodimer of IL-10R2 and IL-22Rα1. Whereas IL-22Rα1 is rather specific for IL-22, IL-20, and IL-24, IL-10R2 is shared with more cytokines of the IL-10 superfamily, including IL-10, IL-22, IL-26, and type III interferons: IL-28A/B and IL-29 (19Dudakov J.

First, the mCherry-nanobody (CVHH) was genetically fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of IL-10R2 in CVHHIL-10R2 (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A) and introduced into Ba/F3/gp130 cells. The transmembrane domain of the IL-22Rα1 was genetically fused to the GFP nanobody (GVHH), resulting in GVHHIL-22Rα1 (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1A). Expression of IL-22Rα1 and IL-10R2 in Ba/F3/gp130/IL-22Rα1/IL-10R2 cells or N-terminally HA-tagged CVHHIL-10R2 and Myc-tagged GFPVHHIL-22Rα1 in Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells was verified by flow cytometry (Fig. S1B). Ba/F3/gp130 cells are commonly used in cytokine research, because after activation of gp130 signaling by stimulation with, for example, Hyper-IL-6 (a fusion protein of IL-6 and the soluble IL-6R) (22Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. SOCS3 exerts its inhibitory function on interleukin-6 signal transduction through the SHP2 recruitment site of gp130.J. Biol.

As expected, Hyper-IL-6 and IL-22 induced proliferation of Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 cells, whereas IL-22 and IL-22-Fc were not able to induce proliferation of Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2 cells.

Here we decided to use the lower concentration because it was enough to inhibit proliferation of Ba/F3-gp130 cells (Fig. 1B), albeit the higher concentration resulted in a more profound inhibition of all analyzed Janus kinases (Fig. S1C). Among the tested synthetic ligands composed of homo- and heterodimeric GFP-mCherry fusion proteins, the heterodimeric GFP-mCherry induced proliferation of Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells but not of Ba/F3/gp130 cells, which was also inhibited by P6 (Fig. 1C). As a control, cells were also stimulated with monomeric GFP and mCherry, which did not induce cellular proliferation (Fig. 1C). For the stimulation with homodimeric GFP or mCherry, they were genetically fused to a cDNA coding for a human Fc tag, which facilitated homodimerization of GFP-Fc and mCherry-Fc (5Mossner S. Phan H. Triller S. Moll J. Conrad U. Scheller J. Multimerization strategies for efficient production and purification of highly active synthetic cytokine receptor ligands.PLoS ONE. 2020; 15 (32236103)e023080410.1371/journal.pone.0230804PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas GFP-Fc also did not induce cellular proliferation, homodimeric mCherry-Fc induced cellular proliferation of Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells, suggesting that a synthetic dimer of CVHHIL-10R2 but not of GVHHIL-22Rα1 was biologically active (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D showed that the proliferation rate of Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 and Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 cells depended on the concentration of the synthetic GFP-mCherry fusion protein or IL-22-Fc reaching the half-maximal proliferation at 5.5 ng/ml for GFP-mCherry and 2.1 ng/ml for IL-22-Fc, whereas GFP-mCherry failed to induce proliferation of Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 cells. We also performed this experiment with Ba/F3/gp130/GVHHIL-10R2/CVHHIL-22Rα1 cells, where the extracellular domains of the SyCyRs were reciprocally exchanged, and obtained similar results (Fig. S1D). Dimeric IL-22Fc selectively induced cellular proliferation via the IL-22Rα1/IL-10R2 heterodimer and did not induce proliferation of Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2 and Ba/F3/gp130/IL-22Rα1 cells (Fig. 1E). IL-22 signals mainly via phosphorylated STAT3 and ERK1/2 induced via Jak1 and Tyk2 phosphorylation as shown in Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 cells, all of which could be inhibited by the P6 inhibitor at least to some extent, with the exception of Tyk2 (Fig. 2A) (25Lejeune D.

Photochemical preparation of a pyridone containing tetracycle: a Jak protein kinase inhibitor.Bioorg. Med. Chem.

However, higher concentrations of P6 (100 μm) resulted in inhibition of all JAKs (Fig. S1C). Consequently, stimulation of Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells with GFP-mCherry induced phosphorylation of STAT3 and ERK1/2 as shown by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). As control, Hyper-IL-6 also induced pSTAT3 and pERK1/2 in Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells (Fig. 2B). Importantly, dimeric mCherry-Fc but not GFP-Fc also induced sustained phosphorylation of STAT3, ERK1/2, Jak1, and Tyk2 but also additionally of Jak2, which was not observed for natural and synthetic IL-22 signaling (Fig. 2, A and B). The phosphorylation of Tyk2 for human IL-10R2 homodimers has been shown previously (27Kotenko S. Izotova L. Pollack B. Muthukumaran G. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J. Pestka S. Other kinases can substitute for Jak2 in signal transduction by interferon-γ.J. Biol.

P6 suppressed STAT3, ERK1/2, and Jak1 phosphorylation, but not Jak2 and Tyk2 (Fig. 2B), suggesting that Jak1 is critical for synthetic cytokine receptor activation, which is also in agreement with natural IL-22 signaling (15Kotenko S.

Next, Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 and Ba/F3/gp130/GVHHIL-10R2/CVHHIL-22Rα1 cells were stimulated with IL-22-Fc and GFP-mCherry, respectively, for up to 480 min and STAT3 phosphorylation, and expression of SOCS3 was monitored by Western blotting. IL-22-Fc and GFP-mCherry induced STAT3 phosphorylation within 5–10 min of cellular stimulation, which was slightly down-regulated after 480 min only in Ba/F3 cells expressing the suitable natural or synthetic receptor combination (Fig. 2C). SOCS3 is a target gene of STAT3 and is up-regulated after IL-22-Fc and GFP-mCherry stimulation of Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 and Ba/F3/gp130/GVHHIL-10R2/CVHHIL-22Rα1 cells, respectively, after about 60–120 min of stimulation (Fig. 2C), whereas no SOCS3 expression was observed in Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 cells stimulated with GFP-mCherry and Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells stimulated with IL-22-Fc. Further, we analyzed the mRNA expression by gene array analysis of Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 cells stimulated with IL-22 and Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells stimulated with GFP-mCherry, indicating a high overlap of gene regulation. In Fig. 3A, all conditions were compared between the different cell lines in one scattered blot, which revealed a high degree of overlap. In Fig. 3 (B and C), we specifically compared unstimulated and stimulated conditions of one cell line and observed an activation of gene transcription upon stimulation that was stronger for IL-22 compared with the GFP-mCherry stimulated cell line. However, among the regulated genes are, in both conditions, typical STAT3 target genes, including SOCS3, Pim-1, and Myc (Fig. 3D). mRNA level of SOCS3, Pim-1, and Myc was verified by qPCR (Fig. 4), supporting our data obtained from the gene array analysis. In summary, our data revealed a high degree of overlap between the signaling induced by the synthetic ligand GFP-mCherry and the natural cytokine IL-22.Figure 4Verification of microarray data by quantification of mRNA expression of three genes (Pim-1, IL-6, and myc) for Ba/F3/gp130/IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 and Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells.

One representative experiment, with three biological replicates, of four is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we used Ba/F3/gp130/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells (Fig. S2A) to verify that homodimers of the synthetic IL-22Rα1 are not biologically active as suggested in Fig. 1C. Cell-surface expression of GVHHIL-22Rα1 was verified by flow cytometry (Fig. S2B). Dimeric GFP-Fc was not able to induce cellular proliferation of Ba/F3/gp130 and Ba/F3/gp130/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells (Fig. S2C). Also, monomeric and dimeric GFP-Fc did not induce STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. S2D). As a control, Hyper-IL-6 induced cellular proliferation and STAT3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. S2, C and D). We also performed this experiment with Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-22Rα1 cells and dimeric mCherry and obtained comparable results (Fig. S3, A and B). Interestingly, the overall assembly of GVHHIL-22Rα1 was correct because we showed binding of GFP-Fc to Ba/F3/gp130/GVHHIL-22Rα1 but not to Ba/F3/gp130 cells by flow cytometry (Fig. S3C). In conclusion, SyCyRs for IL-22Rα1 fail to form biologically active homodimers. This finding was surprising because the intracellular domain of the long-chain cytokine receptor IL-22Rα1 is 346 amino acid residues long, and apart from binding sites for Jak1, it also contains multiple initiation sites for signal transduction (e.g. STATs) (25Lejeune D. Dumoutier L. Constantinescu S. Kruijer W. Schuringa J. Renauld J. Interleukin-22 (IL-22) activates the JAK/STAT, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinase pathways in a rat hepatoma cell line: pathways that are shared with and distinct from IL-10.J. Biol.

Receptors with short ICDs including IL-10R2 often bind their ligands with lower affinity, pair with Tyk2 or Jak2 (27Kotenko S. Izotova L. Pollack B. Muthukumaran G. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J. Pestka S. Other kinases can substitute for Jak2 in signal transduction by interferon-γ.J. Biol.

The JAK-STAT signaling pathway: input and output integration.J. Immunol. 2007; 178 (17312100): 2623-262910.4049/jimmunol.178.5.2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar, 29Wang X. Lupardus P.

Only in combination with long-chain receptors, such as IL-22Rα1, do this kind of receptors contribute to activation of signal transduction. On the other hand, results presented in Figure 1, Figure 2 suggest that homodimers of IL-10R2 induce signal transduction that is highly similar to signaling induced by IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 heterodimers. In line with this, Kotenko et al. (27Kotenko S. Izotova L. Pollack B. Muthukumaran G. Paukku K. Silvennoinen O. Ihle J. Pestka S. Other kinases can substitute for Jak2 in signal transduction by interferon-γ.J. Biol.

Therefore, we generated Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2 cells (Fig. 5A). Cell-surface expression of CVHHIL-10R2 was verified by flow cytometry (Fig. S4A). The proliferation of Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2 cells depended on the concentration of synthetic mCherry-Fc fusion proteins, reaching the half-maximal proliferation at 41.74 ng/ml (Fig. 5B). mCherry-Fc–induced proliferation of Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2 cells was inhibited by P6 (Fig. 5C). Western blotting of Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2 cells showed that mCherry-Fc induced STAT3, ERK1/2, Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 phosphorylation, whereas monomeric mCherry was not able to induce signal transduction (Fig. 5D). P6 selectively inhibited phosphorylation of Jak1 but not of Jak2 and Tyk2 and resulted in STAT3 suppression and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 5D). The inhibition of Jak2 and Tyk2 phosphorylation was achieved using higher concentrations of 100 μm P6 (Fig. S1C). The IL-10R2 was also able to phosphorylate STAT3 when expressed with a GFPVHH, resulting in Ba/F3/gp130/GVHHIL-10R2 cells (Fig. S4B). The finding that CVHHIL-10R2 homodimerization induced activation of Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 was supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using transiently transfected HEK293T cells. Here, precipitation of Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of GVHHIL-10R2, suggesting that all three tyrosine kinases are physically interacting with the intracellular domain of GVHHIL-10R2 (Fig. 5E). Next, we analyzed the mRNA expression by gene array analysis of Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2/GVHHIL-22Rα1 cells stimulated either with GFP-mCherry or mCherry-Fc, indicating a high overlap of gene regulation (Fig. 6A). In Fig. 6 (B and C), we specifically compared unstimulated and stimulated conditions either as homo- or heterodimer of the cell line and observed an activation of gene transcription upon stimulation that was comparable between the synthetic cytokine stimulations. However, among the regulated genes are, in both conditions, typical STAT3 target genes, including SOCS3, Pim-1, and Myc (Fig. 6D). mRNA level of SOCS3, Pim-1, and Myc was verified by qPCR (Fig. 6E), supporting our data obtained from the gene array analysis. This indicates that the IL-10R2 homodimer can induce nearly the same signal transduction as the IL-10R2/IL-22Rα1 heterodimer. In the intracellular domain of the IL-10R2, no obvious Janus kinase–binding sites, such as the typical box 1 and box 2 motifs, and no canonical tyrosine-dependent phosphorylation motifs are present. Additionally, the intracellular domain of the IL-10R2 contains only one tyrosine amino acid residue, which is directly located at the border of the transmembrane domain and is not imbedded in a STAT3 or ERK activation motif. To decipher signal transduction, we generated deletion variants of the intracellular domain of the CVHHIL-10R2, with deletions after amino acid 255 (Δ255), 280 (Δ280), 310 (Δ310), and 330 (Δ330) (based on the WT sequence of IL-10R2) (Fig. 7A and Fig. S5A). Ba/F3/gp130 cells were generated expressing exclusively the CVHHIL-10R2 or the respective deletion variant. Cell-surface expression was verified by flow cytometry (Fig. S5B). As control, all Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2 cells proliferated in the presence of Hyper-IL-6. Again, Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2 cells proliferated in the presence of mCherry-Fc. Of the deletion variants, only Ba/F3/gp130/CVHHIL-10R2(Δ330) showed sustained proliferation, whereas all other deletion variants did not facilitate cellular proliferation with 100 ng/ml mCherr"
https://openalex.org/W3038513683,"Pathogens pose a major risk to wild host populations, especially in the face of ongoing biodiversity declines. Beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) can affect most if not all members of one of the largest and most threatened bird orders world-wide, the Psittaciformes. Signs of disease can be severe and mortality rates high. Its broad host range makes it a risk to threatened species in particular, because infection can occur via spill-over from abundant hosts. Despite these risks, surveillance of BFDV in locally abundant wild host species has been lacking. We used qPCR and haemagglutination assays to investigate BFDV prevalence, load and shedding in seven abundant host species in the wild in south-east Australia: Crimson Rosellas (Platycercus elegans), Eastern Rosellas (Platycercus eximius), Galahs (Eolophus roseicapillus), Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (Cacatua galerita), Blue-winged Parrots (Neophema chrysostoma), Rainbow Lorikeets (Trichoglossus moluccanus) and Red-rumped Parrots (Psephotus haematonotus). We found BFDV infection in clinically normal birds in six of the seven species sampled. We focused our analysis on the four most commonly caught species, namely Crimson Rosellas (BFDV prevalence in blood samples: 41.8%), Sulphur-crested Cockatoos (20.0%), Blue-winged Parrots (11.8%) and Galahs (8.8%). Species, but not sex, was a significant predictor for BFDV prevalence and load. 56.1% of BFDV positive individuals were excreting BFDV antigen into their feathers, indicative of active viral replication with shedding. Being BFDV positive in blood samples predicted shedding in Crimson Rosellas. Our study confirms that BFDV is endemic in our study region, and can inform targeted disease management by providing comparative data on interspecies variation in virus prevalence, load and shedding."

In humans, there are >100 known and candidate protein lysine methyltransferases (PKMTs), many of which are linked to human diseases. Methyltransferase-like protein 21C (METTL21C) is a PKMT implicated in muscle biology that has been reported to methylate valosin-containing protein/p97 (VCP) and heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8).

Here, we used an unbiased biochemistry-based screening assay coupled to MS, which identified alanine tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) as a direct substrate of METTL21C. We found that METTL21C catalyzes methylation of Lys-943 of AARS1 (AARS1-K943me) both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro METTL21C-mediated AARS1 methylation was independent of ATP or tRNA molecules. Unlike for AARS1, and in conflict with previous reports, we did not detect METTL21C methylation of VCP and HSPA8. AARS1-K943 methylation in HEK293T cells depends upon METTL21C levels. Finally, METTL2C was almost exclusively expressed in muscle tissue, and, accordingly, we detected METTL21C-catalyzed methylation of AARS1 in mouse skeletal muscle tissue. These results reveal that AARS1 is a bona fide in vitro substrate of METTL21C and suggest a role for the METTL21C-AARS1 axis in the regulation of protein synthesis in muscle tissue.

Furthermore, many 7βS-containing enzymes are candidate KMTs, but their potential substrate(s) and biological function(s) are not known. METTL21C is 7βS-containing domain that is expressed largely in skeletal muscle tissue and belongs to the METTL21 family of proteins, which also includes METTL21A, METTL21B, and METTL21D. All members of the METTL21 family have been reported to methylate nonhistone substrates (and do not methylate histones). METTL21A is reported to methylate several members of the HSP70 family of proteins at a highly conserved lysine (14Jakobsson M.E. Moen A. Bousset L. Egge-Jacobsen W. Kernstock S. Melki R. Falnes P.O.

In this study, the authors used an in vitro methylation assay to support their conclusion that could not distinguish a positive signal coming from bona fide methylation of HSPA8 versus autolabeling of METTL21C (see below), making it unclear whether or not METTL21C modifies HSPA8. Overall, the ambiguity around METTL21C activity on VCP and HSPA8 is challenging to evaluate without a clear positive control substrate (18Wiederstein J.L. Nolte H. Gunther S. Piller T. Baraldo M.

Here, to identify bona fide METTL21C substrates and evaluate previously reported substrates, we employed an unbiased biochemical approach coupled to MS (6Wilkinson A.W. Diep J. Dai S. Liu S. Ooi Y.S.

Using this strategy, we identify the cytoplasmic aminoacyl-tRNA transferase AARS1 as a METTL21C substrate. We find that METTL21C specifically mono-, di-, and trimethylates AARS1 at lysine 943 in vitro and in cells. Moreover, we observe that AARS1 is methylated in mouse skeletal muscle, the tissue type that shows the highest expression of METTL21C protein. In contrast to AARS1, we find no evidence in vitro or in cells that METTL21C methylates VCP or HSPA8, arguing that more work is required to understand how METTL21C influences biological processes associated with these important proteins and associated pathways. Together, our study identifies a bona fide substrate of METTL21C and highlights the importance of biochemical analyses in assessing candidate activities of PKMTs, a group of enzymes with important roles in human health and disease. To investigate METTL21C biochemical activity we took advantage of two observations: 1) a crystal structure of METTL21C is available and can be used to generate candidate, structure-guided mutations (PDB code 4MTL) and 2) in in vitro methylation assays using recombinant METTL21C and [3H]SAM as the methyl donor, but no substrate, METTL21C is autolabeled, a phenomenon we have observed for many PKMTs (3Carlson S.M.

In the structure, tryptophan 92 (Trp-92) and tyrosine 197 (Tyr-197) form contacts with the cofactor SAM (Fig. 1A). Recombinant mutant METTL21C protein harboring substitutions at these two residues (W92F/Y197A) expresses like WT protein but in contrast to the WT protein, shows no autolabeling activity (Fig. 1B). We postulated that METTL21C-W92F/Y197A (METTL21CMut) could be used as a potential negative control in unbiased experiments aimed at identifying a bona fide biochemical activity. In cellular localization studies, we observed that Flag-METTL21C (stably expressed) is principally detected in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). We were not able to determine the cellular distribution of endogenous METTL21C as it is not detectable in a number of standard human cell lines that we have examined. Based on these results, we focused on identifying cytoplasmic proteins as candidate METTL21C substrates using a two-step fractionation protocol coupled to MS (see schematic in Fig. 1D). In vitro methylation assays were performed with WT or mutant METTL21C and [3H]SAM on fractions from total cytoplasmic extract size separated by gel filtration chromatography to screen for a METTL21C-dependent activity; defined as a radiolabeled band specifically detected in reactions with WT but not mutant METTL21C (6Wilkinson A.W.

As shown in Fig. 1E, a band detected at 100 kDa that meets these criteria was clearly observed in three fractions (A8-10), with no other specific band detected in these extracts. To identify the candidate protein and residue(s) modified by METTL21C, in vitro methylation assays were performed on three fractions (fractions 8-10) and the products were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC–MS/MS); deuterated SAM was used as the methyl donor to distinguish recombinant METTL21C-catalyzed methylation from other sources, including chemical methylation (21Carlson S.M.

MS analysis identified a peptide from the 100-kDa protein alanine-tRNA synthetase 1 (AARS1) in which deuterated methyl (me1-3) was incorporated at lysine 943 (Lys-943), whereas no other deuterated peptides were identified in the fractions (Fig. 1F, Fig. S1 and Tables S1–S4). We note that a corresponding unmodified peptide containing Lys-943 of AARS1 is cleaved by trypsin after Lys-943 and thus elutes earlier than di- and trimethylated peptides as well as the miscleaved monomethylated peptide. Finally, recombinant AARS1 is directly methylated by METT21C (Fig. 1G). Based on these data, we postulated that AARS1-K943 is a candidate substrate site of METTL21C. AARS1 plays a critical role in translating the genetic code via the high fidelity linkage of alanine to its cognate tRNA (tRNAAla) (23Peacock J.R. Walvoord R.R. Chang A.Y. Kozlowski M.C. Gamper H. Hou Y.M. Amino acid-dependent stability of the acyl linkage in aminoacyl-tRNA.RNA. 2014; 20 (24751649): 758-76410.1261/rna.044123.113Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To map the site(s) of METTL21C-catalyzed methylation of AARS1, in vitro methylation assays were performed using recombinant WT or catalytic mutant METLL21C and full-length (FL) AARS1 or two AARS1 derivatives spanning either the N terminus 600 residues (N-term, amino acids 1-600) or the C terminus (C-term, amino acids 601-969) as substrates (Fig. 2, A and B). WT METTL21C, but not the catalytic mutant, methylates full-length and C-term AARS1, but not N-term AARS1, indicating that the C-terminal region, which contains Lys-943, is a sufficient substrate for METTL21C (Fig. 2B). Next, substitution of lysine 943 to alanine (K943A) on full-length AARS1 abrogated METTL21C methylation of AARS1 (though METTL21C retained autolabeling, see “Discussion”) (Fig. 2C). Similar results were observed by LC–MS/MS analysis of the in vitro methylation assay using the full-length recombinant proteins and deuterated-SAM; we note that trimethylation was not observed in these reactions (Fig. S2, Table S5). Based on these data we conclude that AARS1 is in vitro methylated at Lys-943 by METTL21C. In addition to AARS1, cells possess a second alanine tRNA-synthetase named AARS2 that is specific for mitochondrial synthetized proteins. Consistent with the fact that METTL21C is not located in the mitochondria, METTL21C does not methylate AARS2 in vitro, suggesting specificity for AARS1 (Fig. 2D). A critical step in AARS1-catalyzed formation of activated alanine tRNA, is alanine activation by ATP, which facilitates transfer to the tRNA molecule (24Ibba M. Soll D. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthesis.Annu.

We therefore next asked whether tRNA or ATP impacts METTL21C methylation of AARS1. As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, the intensity of METT21C-catalyzed AARS1 methylation is not altered by the presence of tRNA or ATP molecules. Taken together, these results demonstrate that AARS1, but not AARS2, is a substrate that is directly methylated by METTL21C, and this methylation reaction occurred independently of ATP and total tRNA in vitro. Key residues that constitute the catalytic pocket are conserved within the METTL21 family (METTL21A-D; see Fig. S3A for alignment). We therefore asked whether the other METTL21 proteins (A, B, and D) share METTL21C's activity and can methylate AARS1. In in vitro methylation assays, only METTL21C, but not METTL21A, METTL21B, or METTL21D methylates AARS1 (Fig. 3A). In this context, METTL21C was claimed to methylate the METTL21A substrate HSPA8 and the METTL21D substrate VCP, although in both cases, direct evidence of METTL21C specifically catalyzing the addition of methyl to substrate was not reported (14Jakobsson M.E.

Leveraging AARS1 as a positive control, we compared the activity of METTL21C on VCP and HSPA8 relative to its activity AARS1, as well as relative to the positive control enzymes METTL21A and METTL21D methylation of HSPA8 and VCP, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). Notably, in contrast to the positive control enzymes, METTL21C, which is active on AARS1, does not methylate HSPA8 (Fig. 3B) or VCP (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that METTL21C does not directly regulate VCP or HSPA8 and therefore the reported physiologic functions of METTL21C in regulating these proteins may need reevaluation (see “Discussion”). Enzyme-substrate interactions in a physiologic context are frequently transient but still strong enough to detect. In this context, endogenous AARS1 is present in Flag-METTL21C, but not control IgG, co-immunoprecipitates (co-IPs) from 293T cells (Fig. 4A). To ascertain whether METTL21C could methylate AARS1 in cells, GFP-AARS1 was co-expressed with or without Flag-METTL21C in 293T cells and the methylation status of Lys-943 was determined by LC–MS/MS. In the absence of METTL21C expression, GFP-AARS1 is not methylated on Lys-943 (Fig. 4B). In cells expressing Flag-METTL21C, the majority of GFP-AARS1 is methylated at Lys-943, with trimethylation being the most abundant species (Fig. 4B, Figs. S4 and S5E, and Table S6). In addition to GFP-AARS1, we also found that endogenous AARS1 is mono-, di-, and trimethylated upon expression of Flag-METTL21C (Fig. 4C, Fig. S5, A–D and F, Table S7). Next, we raised state-specific antibodies against AARS1-K943me1, -me2, and -me3 epitopes, which showed selective recognition of the cognate Lys-943 mono-, di-, and trimethylated peptides and no cross-reactivity with unmodified AARS1 peptide (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, aAARS1-K943me1 and aAARS1-K943me2 in Western blotting assays recognized in vitro methylated AARS1 (Fig. 4E). The aAARS1-K943me3 antibody did not work in this application, likely because there is little trimethylation generated in the in vitro reactions as described above. Finally, we generated 293T stable cell lines expressing Flag-METTL21C and detected METTL21C-dependent methylation of AARS1-K943me2 (Fig. 4F). Notably, in these cell lines, in which there is a clear increase in AARS1 methylation, no change was observed for methylation at VCP-K315, the purported site catalyzed by METTL21C (Fig. 4F) (18Wiederstein J.L.

The methylation of AARS1 is almost certainly due to METTL21C, as depletion of Flag-METTL21C using two independent CRISPR guide RNAs resulted in depletion of AARS1-K943me (Fig. 4G). Based on these results we conclude that METTL21C methylates AARS1-K943 in a cellular context. The mRNA levels of METTL21C are reported to be significantly higher in muscle compared with other tissues in mice (18Wiederstein J.L. Nolte H. Gunther S. Piller T. Baraldo M. Kostin S. Bloch W.

https://openalex.org/W3039556029,"The corpus luteum is a transient endocrine gland that synthesizes and secretes the steroid hormone, progesterone, which is vital for establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Luteinizing hormone (LH) via activation of protein kinase A (PKA) acutely stimulates luteal progesterone synthesis via a complex process, converting cholesterol via a series of enzymatic reactions, into progesterone. Lipid droplets in steroidogenic luteal cells store cholesterol in the form of cholesterol esters, which are postulated to provide substrate for steroidogenesis. Early enzymatic studies showed that hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) hydrolyzes luteal cholesterol esters. In this study, we tested whether HSL is a critical mediator of the acute actions of LH on luteal progesterone production. Using LH-responsive bovine small luteal cells our results reveal that LH, forskolin, and 8-Br cAMP-induced PKA-dependent phosphorylation of HSL at Ser563 and Ser660, events known to promote HSL activity. Small molecule inhibition of HSL activity and siRNA-mediated knock down of HSL abrogated LH-induced progesterone production. Moreover, western blotting and confocal microscopy revealed that LH stimulates phosphorylation and translocation of HSL to lipid droplets. Furthermore, LH increased trafficking of cholesterol from the lipid droplets to the mitochondria, which was dependent on both PKA and HSL activation. Taken together, these findings identify a PKA/HSL signaling pathway in luteal cells in response to LH and demonstrate the dynamic relationship between PKA, HSL, and lipid droplets in luteal progesterone synthesis."

Our sequence data of five gene fragments suggest the presence of two horned sibling Spiophanes species in northern Europe: S. cf. bombyx in the North and the Norwegian seas, and S. cf. convexus in Brittany, northern France, and Bay of Biscay, northern Spain. Spiophanes cf. bombyx worms are genetically close to a single examined specimen of S. bombyx from Venice Lagoon, Italy but their conspecificity should be verified by further study. Our sequence data show that horned Spiophanes from the North Pacific are genetically distant from horned European species, and that S. uschakowi Zachs, 1933, originally described from the Sea of Japan (East Sea) is a valid species. The data also suggest the presence of two horned sibling Spiophanes species in the North East Pacific: S. hakaiensis Radashevsky & Pankova, n. sp. distributed from Alaska south to about Point Conception, and S. norrisi Meißner & Blank, 2009, distributed from San Francisco Bay south to Baja California Sur, Mexico. Spiophanes from South America, morphologically similar to S. norrisi, are suggested to belong to a new species. Molecular data also suggest the presence of two sibling species among the worms from northern Europe identified by morphology as S. kroyeri Grube, 1860. Worms from the Barents Sea and northern part of the North Sea are tentatively referred to as S. cf. kroyeri; worms from the northern and central parts of the North Sea and from the Bay of Biscay, northern Spain, are tentatively referred to as S. cf. cirrata M. Sars in G.O. Sars, 1872. Sequence data also show that S. duplex from California is genetically different from morphologically similar worms from South America. The South American worms are referred to resurrected S. soederstroemi Hartman, 1953 which was originally described from off Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, and then considered as a junior synonym of S. duplex. Analysis of divergence times of Spiophanes lineages suggested that the origin of the most recent common ancestor of horned Spiophanes with metameric nuchal organs was around 11.1 mya (95% HPD: 5.1-19.0 mya) and that the divergence of the North Atlantic and North Pacific lineages was around 7.9 mya (95% HPD: 4.1-13.3 mya). The North Atlantic lineage was estimated to have diverged 4.8 mya (95% HPD: 2.2-8.6 mya), resulting in the origin of S. cf. bombyx and S. cf. convexus. The North Pacific lineage was estimated to have diverged first by the isolation and speciation of S. norrisi 1.7 mya (95% HPD: 2.3-1.0 mya), and then by the isolation and speciation of S. uschakowi and S. hakaiensis n. sp. 1.3 mya (95% HPD: 2.0-0.7 mya). The estimates place the divergences soon after maximum glacial period in the North Pacific (2.4-3.0 mya)."
https://openalex.org/W3040617421,"Inflammation response is a defense to infection induced by invading pathogen or tissue injury. However, exaggerated inflammation may cause autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, stroke and rheumatoid arthritis. Anti-inflammatory agents and anti-cytokine therapy have been developed to inhibit inflammation pathways and neutralize cytokine storm, but the off-targeting delivery and damage in immune system cause systemic severe side-effect. Selective targeting, precise intracellular drug delivery and induced programed apoptosis of neutrophils may be a potential strategy to regulate the inflammatory responses for immune homeostasis. In this commentary, we summarized that the assembled engineering prodrug nanoparticles carrying doxorubicin via pH-responsive bonds that specifically target to and efficiently induce the apoptosis of activated neutrophils for anti-inflammation with high therapeutic efficacy and no systemically toxicity could be a promising strategy for neutrophil-mediated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3039267402,"The goal of this study was to use liquid chromatography mass spectrometry to assess metabolic changes of two different diets in three distinct rat strains. Sprague-Dawley, Fischer 344, and Brown-Norway male rats were maintained on a high-fat, or regular diet for 24 weeks. Liver tissue was collected at 4, 12, and 24 weeks to assess global small molecule metabolite changes using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry coupled to ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. The results of the global metabolomics analysis revealed significant changes based on both age and diet within all three strains. Principal component analysis revealed that the influence of diet caused a greater variation in significantly changing metabolites than that of age for the Brown Norway and Fisher 344 strains, whereas diet had the greatest influence in the Sprague Dawley strain only at the 4-week time point. As expected, metabolites involved in lipid metabolism were changed in the animals maintained on a high fat diet compared to the regular diet. There were also significant changes observed in the concentration of Tri carboxylic acid cycle intermediates that were extracted from the liver of all three strains based on diet. The results of this study showed that a high fat diet caused significant liver and metabolic changes compared to a regular diet in multiple rat strains. The inbred Fisher 344 and Brown Norway rats were more metabolically sensitive to the diet changes than outbred Sprague Dawley strain. The study also showed that age, as was the case for Sprague Dawley, is an important variable to consider when assessing metabolic changes."
https://openalex.org/W3039713570,"Personality traits such as grit and self-control are important determinants of success in life outcomes. However, most measures of these traits, which rely on self-reports, might be biased when used for the purpose of evaluating education policies or interventions. Recent research has shown the potential of survey effort—in particular, item non-response and careless answering—as a proxy measure of these traits. The current investigation uses a dataset of high school seniors (N = 513) to investigate survey effort measures in relationship with teacher reports, performance task measures, high school academic outcomes, and college attendance. Our results show promise for use of survey effort as proxy measures of grit and self-control."
https://openalex.org/W3039984720,"Adequate anchoring of the placenta in the uterus through invasion of first trimester cytotrophoblasts (CTB) is required for a successful pregnancy. This process is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and regulated by the maternal environment. Obesity is known to alter the intrauterine milieu and has been related to impaired invasion. We hypothesized that placental MMP15, a novel membrane-type MMP, is involved in CTB invasion and regulated by maternal obesity in early pregnancy. Thus, in this study MMP15 was immunolocalized to invasive extravillous and interstitial CTB. MMP15 silencing in chorionic villous explants using two different siRNAs reduced trophoblast outgrowth length (−35%, P ≤ .001 and −26%, P < .05) and area (−43%, P ≤ .001 and −36%, P ≤ .01) without altering trophoblast proliferation or apoptosis. Short-term treatment of primary first trimester trophoblasts with IL-6 (10 ng/mL), interleukin 10 (IL-10) (50 ng/mL), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) (10 ng/mL) did not affect MMP15 protein levels. Likewise, MMP15 mRNA and protein levels were unaltered between human first trimester placentas from control pregnancies vs those complicated with maternal obesity. Overall, our results suggest that the role of MMP15 in placental development and function in early pregnancy is limited to CTB invasion without being affected by short- and long-term inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3040110385,"Whether language information influences recognition of emotion from facial expressions remains the subject of debate. The current studies investigate how variations in emotion labels that are paired with expressions influences participants' judgments of the emotion displayed. Static (Study 1) and dynamic (Study 2) facial expressions depicting eight emotion categories were paired with emotion labels that systematically varied in arousal (low and high). Participants rated the arousal, valence, and dominance of expressions paired with labels. Isolated faces and isolated labels were also rated. As predicted, the label presented influenced participants' judgments of the expressions. Across both studies, higher arousal labels were associated with: 1) higher ratings of arousal for sad, angry, and scared expressions, and 2) higher ratings of dominance for angry, proud, and disgust expressions. These results indicate that emotion labels influence judgments of facial expressions."
https://openalex.org/W3038735845,"In social insects, collective choices between food sources are based on self-organized mechanisms where information about resources are locally processed by the foragers. Such a collective decision emerges from the competition between pheromone trails leading to different resources but also between the recruiting stimuli emitted by successful foragers at nest entrances. In this study, we investigated how an additional nest entrance influences the ability of Myrmica rubra ant colonies to exploit two food sources of different quality (1M and 0.1M sucrose solution) and to select the most rewarding one. We found that the mobilisation of workers doubled in two-entrance nests compared to one-entrance nests but that ants were less likely to reach a food source once they exited the nest. Moreover, the collective selection of the most rewarding food source was less marked in two-entrance nests, with foragers distributing themselves evenly between the two feeders. Ultimately, multiple nest entrances reduced the foraging efficiency of ant colonies that consumed significantly less sugar out of the two available resources. Our results highlight that the nest structure, more specifically the number of nest entrances, can impede the ant’s ability to process information about environmental opportunities and to select the most rewarding resource. This study opens new insights on how the physical interface between the nest interior and the outside environment can act upon collective decision-making and foraging efficiency in self-organized insect societies."
https://openalex.org/W3039874810,"The Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima Bl.) was introduced into Japan about 100 years ago. Since then, a number of Chinese chestnut cultivars and Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars have been selected by farmers and plant breeders, but little information has been available about their origins and genetic relationships. A classification based on simple sequence repeat markers was conducted using 230 cultivars including Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata Sieb. et Zucc.) cultivars originated in Japan, Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars, and Chinese chestnut cultivars originated in both Japan and China. First, a search for synonyms (cultivars with identical genotypes) revealed 23 synonym groups among the Chinese chestnut cultivars, and all but one cultivar from each synonym group was omitted from further analyses. Second, genetic structure analysis showed a clear division between Japanese and Chinese chestnut, and most of the Japanese and Chinese cultivars had a simple genetic structure corresponding to the expected species. On the other hand, most Japanese-Chinese hybrid cultivars had admixed genetic structure. Through a combination of parentage and chloroplast haplotype analyses, 16 of the 18 hybrid cultivars in this study were inferred to have parent-offspring relationships with other cultivars originated in Japan. Finally, Bayesian clustering and chloroplast haplotype analysis showed that the 116 Chinese chestnut cultivars could be divided into two groups: one originated in the Hebei region of China and the other originated in the Jiangsu and Anhui regions of China. The Chinese chestnut cultivars selected in Japan showed various patterns of genetic structure including Hebei origin, Jiangsu or Anhui origin, and admixed. The chestnut cultivar genetic classifications obtained in this study will be useful for both Japanese and Chinese chestnut breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W3040029312,"Sporadic late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD) preceded by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the most common type of dementia. Long-term studies of immunity to pathogenic amyloid-β (Aβ) in LOAD are lacking. Innate immunity of LOAD patients is malfunctioning in phagocytosis and degradation of Aβ and LOAD patients' macrophage transcriptome and metabolome are deregulated. We previously showed omega-3 fatty acid (ω-3)-mediated repair of unfolded protein response and here we show much broader transcriptomic effects. ω-3 treatment in vitro and ω-3 supplementation by the drink Smartfish (SMF) in vivo increased the transcripts of the genes and pathways of immunity, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, OX-PHOS, nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD+ ) synthesis, and reversed the defects in Aβ phagocytosis. In both peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and macrophages, ω-3 increased ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and ω-3 with carnitine was superior to ω-3. ω-3 treatment in vitro and supplementation by the ω-3 drink SMF in vivo rescued macrophage phagocytosis when glycolysis or glycosylation were blocked. ω-3 provide flexible energy for immune clearance of the brain throughout the diurnal cycle, even in hypo- or hyper-glycemia. In certain LOAD patients, ω-3 may delay progression to dementia."
https://openalex.org/W3039598749,"Epidemiological evidence from prospective cohort studies on risk factors of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is limited as case ascertainment is challenging due to a lack of registries and the disease course of PD. The objective of this study was to create a case ascertainment method for PD within two prospective Dutch cohorts based on multiple sources of PD information. This method was validated using clinical records from the general practitioners (GPs). Face validity of the case ascertainment was tested for three etiological factors (smoking, sex and family history of PD). In total 54825 participants were included from the cohorts AMIGO and EPIC-NL. Sources of PD information included self-reported PD, self-reported PD medication, a 9 item screening questionnaire (Tanner), electronical medical records, hospital discharge data and mortality records. Based on these sources we developed a likelihood score with 4 categories (no PD, unlikely PD, possible PD, likely PD). For the different sources of PD information and for the likelihood score we present the agreement with GP-validated cases. Risk of PD for established factors was studied by logistic regression as exact diagnose dates were not always available. Based on the algorithm, we assigned 346 participants to the likely PD category. GP validation confirmed 67% of these participants in EPIC-NL, but only 12% in AMIGO. PD was confirmed in only 3% of the participants with a possible PD classification. PD case ascertainment by mortality records (91%), EMR ICPC (82%) and self-reported information (62–69%) had the highest confirmation rates. The Tanner PD screening questionnaire had a lower agreement (18%). Risk estimates for smoking, family history and sex using all likely PD cases were comparable to the literature for EPIC-NL, but not for smoking in AMIGO. Using multiple sources of PD evidence in cohorts remains important but challenging as performance of sources varied in validity."
https://openalex.org/W3038214882,"This paper investigate the impact of leverage structure on stock price synchronicity. To better understand the mechanism of the impact of leverage, we break leverage into operating leverage and financing leverage. This breakdown reveals the impact of different component of leverage. Moreover, in this paper, we employ the quantile regression model to investigate the impact of leverage on different level of stock price synchronicity, which provides us a more comprehensive picture. Our empirical results show, operating and financing leverage have negative impact on stock price synchronicity. Moreover, the higher the stock price synchronicity becomes, the higher this impact is. Furthermore, the marginal effect of financing leverage will be attenuated as the profitability of firms becomes higher, but the interaction effect doesn't exist for operating leverage. On the contrary, the marginal effect of financing leverage will be enhanced as the market capitalization of firms becomes larger, again, it doesn't exist for operating leverage. Finally, as firms are state-owned, the marginal effect of both operating and financing leverage will be higher."
https://openalex.org/W3038612210,"This paper reports on the findings of the Nursing and Midwifery Exchange Program, initiated to promote rural and remote nursing and midwifery, and to facilitate clinical skills development and clinical collaboration between health services in Queensland, Australia. The project was undertaken over an 18-month period in one state of Australia, offering structured, temporary exchange of personnel between metropolitan and rural health services.Globally, there is an increasing awareness of nursing shortages, and with it, the need to ensure that nurses and midwives are prepared for specialist roles and practice. This is particularly important in rural and remote areas, where there are pre-existing barriers to access to services, and difficulties in attracting suitably qualified, permanent staff.A mixed methods approach to the evaluation was undertaken with two cohorts. One cohort was the nurses and midwives who participated in the exchange (n = 24) and the other cohort were managers of the participating health services (n = 10). The nurses and midwives who participated in the exchange were asked to complete a questionnaire that included questions related to embeddedness and job satisfaction. The managers participated in a Delphi series of interviews.Those who participated in exchange reporting a higher score on the reported degree of understanding of rural client, which was accompanied with a moderate-to-large effect size estimate (d = 0.61). Nurses/midwives in the exchange group reported higher scores on their perceptions of aspects of their home community that would be lost if they had to leave, which was accompanied with a large effect size (d = 0.83). Overall, NMEP was reported by the participants to be a positive way to improve professional development opportunities for nurses and midwives. The findings also show the program supported practical collaboration and raised the profile of nursing and midwifery in rural areas.Exchange programs support clinical and professional development, raising the awareness of different contexts of practice and related skills requirements, and thereby supporting a greater understanding of different nursing roles. In the light of increasingly complex care required by patients with chronic conditions being managed in community-based services, programs such as NMEP provide the opportunity to build collaborative networks between referring and referral centres as well as contribute to the ongoing skills development."
https://openalex.org/W3038689767,"In this article, we studied geographic variation in the use of personalized genetic testing for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and we evaluated the relationship between genetic testing rates and local socioeconomic and ecological variables. We used data on all advanced NSCLC patients who had a genetic test between April 2012 and April 2013 in France in the frame of the IFCT Biomarqueurs-France study (n = 15814). We computed four established measures of geographic variation of the sex-adjusted rates of genetic testing utilization at the “départment” (the French territory is divided into 94 administrative units called ‘départements’) level. We also performed a spatial regression model to determine the relationship between département-level sex-adjusted rates of genetic testing utilization and economic and ecological variables. Our results are the following: (i) Overall, 46.87% lung cancer admission patients obtained genetic testing for NSCLC; département-level utilization rates varied over 3.2-fold. Measures of geographic variation indicated a relatively high degree of geographic variation. (ii) there was a statistically significant relationship between genetic testing rates and per capita supply of general practitioners, radiotherapists and surgeons (negative correlation for the latter); lower genetic testing rates were also associated with higher local poverty rates. French policymakers should pursue effort toward deprived areas to obtain equal access to personalized medicine for advanced NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3039429312,"To investigate a Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) mortality event following a red tide bloom in Southwest Florida, an RNA sequencing experiment was conducted. Gene expression changes in white blood cells were assessed in manatees rescued from a red tide affected area (n = 4) and a control group (n = 7) using RNA sequencing. The genes with the largest fold changes were compared between the two groups to identify molecular pathways related to cellular and disease processes. In total, 591 genes (false discovery rate <0.05) were differentially expressed in the red tide group. Of these, 158 were upregulated and 433 were downregulated. This suggests major changes in white blood cell composition following an exposure to red tide. The most highly upregulated gene, Osteoclast associated 2C immunoglobulin-like receptor (OSCAR), was upregulated 12-fold. This gene is involved in initiating the immune response and maintaining a role in adaptive and innate immunity. The most highly downregulated gene, Piccolo presynaptic cytomatrix protein (PCLO), was downregulated by a factor of 977-fold. This gene is associated with cognitive functioning and neurotransmitter release. Downregulation of this gene in other studies was associated with neuronal loss and neuron synapse dysfunction. Among the cellular pathways that were most affected, immune response, including inflammation, wounds and injuries, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were the most predominant. The pathway with the most differentially expressed genes was the immune response pathway with 98 genes involved, many of them downregulated. Assessing the changes in gene expression associated with red tide exposure enhances our understanding of manatee immune response to the red tide toxins and will aid in the development of red tide biomarkers."
