https://openalex.org/W2090908091,"Sensing from the ultraviolet-visible to the infrared is critical for a variety of industrial and scientific applications. Today, gallium nitride-, silicon-, and indium gallium arsenide--based detectors are used for different sub-bands within the ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelength range. We demonstrate polymer photodetectors with broad spectral response (300 to 1450 nanometers) fabricated by using a small-band-gap semiconducting polymer blended with a fullerene derivative. Operating at room temperature, the polymer photodetectors exhibit detectivities greater than 10(12) cm Hz(1/2)/W and a linear dynamic range over 100 decibels. The self-assembled nanomorphology and device architecture result in high photodetectivity over this wide spectral range and reduce the dark current (and noise) to values well below dark currents obtained in narrow-band photodetectors made with inorganic semiconductors."
https://openalex.org/W2036632122,"Hockemeyer et al. demonstrate targeted genetic modification of three genes in human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells using zinc-finger nucleases delivered on plasmids. They use the approach to generate a reporter cell line that monitors the pluripotent state, a drug-inducible overexpression system, and a reporter cell line for a gene that is not expressed in pluripotent stem cells. Realizing the full potential of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) requires efficient methods for genetic modification. However, techniques to generate cell type–specific lineage reporters, as well as reliable tools to disrupt, repair or overexpress genes by gene targeting, are inefficient at best and thus are not routinely used. Here we report the highly efficient targeting of three genes in human pluripotent cells using zinc-finger nuclease (ZFN)–mediated genome editing. First, using ZFNs specific for the OCT4 (POU5F1) locus, we generated OCT4-eGFP reporter cells to monitor the pluripotent state of hESCs. Second, we inserted a transgene into the AAVS1 locus to generate a robust drug-inducible overexpression system in hESCs. Finally, we targeted the PITX3 gene, demonstrating that ZFNs can be used to generate reporter cells by targeting non-expressed genes in hESCs and hiPSCs."

How the ordered structure of aragonite layers is achieved has been unclear. Suzuki et al. (p. 1388 , published online 13 August 2009; see the Perspective by Kröger ) identified two acidic matrix proteins (Pif 97 and Pif 80) that regulate nacre formation in the Japanese pearl oyster. The proteins appear to form a complex in which Pif 80 binds to aragonite and Pif 97 binds to other macromolecules in the organic matrix."
https://openalex.org/W2070160936,"Despite increasing pharmaceutical importance, fluorinated aromatic organic molecules remain difficult to synthesize. Present methods require either harsh reaction conditions or highly specialized reagents, making the preparation of complex fluoroarenes challenging. Thus, the development of general methods for their preparation that overcome the limitations of those techniques currently in use is of great interest. We have prepared [LPd(II)Ar(F)] complexes, where L is a biaryl monophosphine ligand and Ar is an aryl group, and identified conditions under which reductive elimination occurs to form an Ar-F bond. On the basis of these results, we have developed a catalytic process that converts aryl bromides and aryl triflates into the corresponding fluorinated arenes by using simple fluoride salts. We expect this method to allow the introduction of fluorine atoms into advanced, highly functionalized intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2094361889,"Porous Anodes for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells Fuel cells that use ion-conducting oxides as the electrolyte can be highly efficient and use hydrocarbon fuels directly. However, their very high operating temperatures (usually above 700°C) can lead to unwanted reactions with their electrode materials and premature degradation of their performance. In order to improve fuel-cell electrochemical performance, Suzuki et al. (p. 852 ) describe a route for increasing the porosity of the anode material, which contains nickel oxide and zirconia doped with scandium and cerium and is fabricated as a cylinder. Subsequent coating and firing steps added a layer of a zirconia-based electrolyte and the (La,Sr)(Co,Fe)O 3 cathode. The resulting fuel-cell power density exceeded 1 watt per square centimeter at 600°C, and its performance improved as hydrogen fuel velocities were increased through the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2122909722,"The use of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) so far has largely relied on nonspecific binding interactions to host small molecular guests. We used long organic struts (approximately 2 nanometers) incorporating 34- and 36-membered macrocyclic polyethers as recognition modules in the construction of several crystalline primitive cubic frameworks that engage in specific binding in a way not observed in passive, open reticulated geometries. MOF-1001 is capable of docking paraquat dication (PQT2+) guests within the macrocycles in a stereoelectronically controlled fashion. This act of specific complexation yields quantitatively the corresponding MOF-1001 pseudorotaxanes, as confirmed by x-ray diffraction and by solid- and solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies performed on MOF-1001, its pseudorotaxanes, and their molecular strut precursors. A control experiment involving the attempted inclusion of PQT2+ inside a framework (MOF-177) devoid of polyether struts showed negligible uptake of PQT2+, indicating the importance of the macrocyclic polyether in PQT2+ docking."
https://openalex.org/W2160674168,"Reducing Sleep Length Humans, like most animals, need their beauty sleep. But the preferred amount and quality of sleep varies between individuals—and some individuals exhibit a heritable, lifetime tendency to sleep less then 6 hours per night. He et al. (p. 866 ; see the Perspective by Hor and Tafti ) identified a mutation in humans associated with people who regularly require shorter than usual sleep duration. The mutation is found in the gene encoding a transcriptional repressor, DEC2, already implicated in regulation of circadian rhythms. Related mutations introduced into mice and flies similarly resulted in shortened sleep phases."

https://openalex.org/W2017168923,"Hepcidin is a peptide hormone that is secreted by the liver and controls body iron homeostasis. Hepcidin overproduction causes anemia of inflammation, whereas its deficiency leads to hemochromatosis. Inflammation and iron are known extracellular stimuli for hepcidin expression. We found that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress also induces hepcidin expression and causes hypoferremia and spleen iron sequestration in mice. CREBH (cyclic AMP response element-binding protein H), an ER stress-activated transcription factor, binds to and transactivates the hepcidin promoter. Hepcidin induction in response to exogenously administered toxins or accumulation of unfolded protein in the ER is defective in CREBH knockout mice, indicating a role for CREBH in ER stress-regulated hepcidin expression. The regulation of hepcidin by ER stress links the intracellular response involved in protein quality control to innate immunity and iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2040392196,"Distinct regions within the ventral visual pathway show neural specialization for nonliving and living stimuli (e.g., tools, houses versus animals, faces). The causes of these category preferences are widely debated. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find that the same regions of the ventral stream that show category preferences for nonliving stimuli and animals in sighted adults show the same category preferences in adults who are blind since birth. Both blind and sighted participants had larger blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) responses in the medial fusiform gyrus for nonliving stimuli compared to animal stimuli and differential BOLD responses in lateral occipital cortex for animal stimuli compared to nonliving stimuli. These findings demonstrate that the medial-to-lateral bias by conceptual domain in the ventral visual pathway does not require visual experience in order to develop and suggest the operation of innately determined domain-specific constraints on the organization of object knowledge."
https://openalex.org/W2166732736,"In motor learning, our brain uses movement errors to adjust planning of future movements. This process has traditionally been studied by examining how motor planning is adjusted in response to visuomotor or dynamic perturbations. Here, I show that the learning strategy can be better identified from the statistics of movements made in the absence of perturbations. The strategy identified this way differs from the learning mechanism assumed in mainstream models for motor learning. Crucial for this strategy is that motor noise arises partly centrally, in movement planning, and partly peripherally, in movement execution. Corrections are made by modification of central planning signals from the previous movement, which include the effects of planning but not execution noise. The size of the corrections is such that the movement variability is minimized. This physiologically plausible strategy is optimally tuned to the properties of motor noise, and likely underlies learning in many motor tasks."
https://openalex.org/W1992769122,"Attention regulates the flood of sensory information into a manageable stream, and so understanding how attention is controlled is central to understanding cognition. Competing theories suggest visual search involves serial and/or parallel allocation of attention, but there is little direct, neural evidence for either mechanism. Two monkeys were trained to covertly search an array for a target stimulus under visual search (endogenous) and pop-out (exogenous) conditions. Here, we present neural evidence in the frontal eye fields (FEF) for serial, covert shifts of attention during search but not pop-out. Furthermore, attention shifts reflected in FEF spiking activity were correlated with 18-34 Hz oscillations in the local field potential, suggesting a ""clocking"" signal. This provides direct neural evidence that primates can spontaneously adopt a serial search strategy and that these serial covert shifts of attention are directed by the FEF. It also suggests that neuron population oscillations may regulate the timing of cognitive processing."
https://openalex.org/W1976022507,"Molecular identification of the Ca(2+)-dependent chloride channel TMEM16A (ANO1) provided a fundamental step in understanding Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) secretion in epithelia. TMEM16A is an intrinsic constituent of Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) channels in cultured epithelia and may control salivary output, but its physiological role in native epithelial tissues remains largely obscure. Here, we demonstrate that Cl(-) secretion in native epithelia activated by Ca(2+)-dependent agonists is missing in mice lacking expression of TMEM16A. Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) transport was missing or largely reduced in isolated tracheal and colonic epithelia, as well as hepatocytes and acinar cells from pancreatic and submandibular glands of TMEM16A(-/-) animals. Measurement of particle transport on the surface of tracheas ex vivo indicated largely reduced mucociliary clearance in TMEM16A(-/-) mice. These results clearly demonstrate the broad physiological role of TMEM16A(-/-) for Ca(2+)-dependent Cl(-) secretion and provide the basis for novel treatments in cystic fibrosis, infectious diarrhea, and Sjöegren syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2049578724,"Why Birds of a Feather Flock Together The biological determination of sociality, that is, why one might choose to associate with others and how many, has been unclear. Goodson et al. (p. 862 ) show that in gregarious finches, oxytocin-like receptors and their cognate ligand, mesotocin, are associated with group size choices. Receptor distributions clearly differentiate territorial species from flocking species. Furthermore, these compounds appear to play a role in affecting choice in affiliation in mammals, and thus may be conserved across evolutionary distant taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2024111305,"Expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR) causes spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). We previously showed that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of AR reduces ligand binding and attenuates the mutant AR toxicity. Here, we show that in culture insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) reduces AR aggregation and increases AR clearance via the ubiquitin-proteasome system through phosphorylation of AR by Akt. In vivo, SBMA transgenic mice overexpressing a muscle-specific isoform of IGF-1 selectively in skeletal muscle show evidence of increased Akt activation and AR phosphorylation and decreased AR aggregation. Augmentation of IGF-1/Akt signaling rescues behavioral and histopathological abnormalities, extends the life span, and reduces both muscle and spinal cord pathology of SBMA mice. This study establishes IGF-1/Akt-mediated inactivation of mutant AR as a strategy to counteract disease in vivo and demonstrates that skeletal muscle is a viable target tissue for therapeutic intervention in SBMA."
https://openalex.org/W2118324297,"Variations in the intensity of high-latitude Northern Hemisphere summer insolation, driven largely by precession of the equinoxes, are widely thought to control the timing of Late Pleistocene glacial terminations. However, recently it has been suggested that changes in Earth's obliquity may be a more important mechanism. We present a new speleothem-based North Atlantic marine chronology that shows that the penultimate glacial termination (Termination II) commenced 141,000 +/- 2500 years before the present, too early to be explained by Northern Hemisphere summer insolation but consistent with changes in Earth's obliquity. Our record reveals that Terminations I and II are separated by three obliquity cycles and that they started at near-identical obliquity phases."

Now Bormuth et al. (p. 870 ; see the Perspective by Veigel and Schmidt ) have used single molecule measurements to characterize the frictional drag force of kinesin-8 motor proteins interacting with their microtubule track. Friction, arising from rupture of bonds with the track, constrains the speed and efficiency of the motor protein."
https://openalex.org/W1989415069,"Background Early diagnosis of sepsis enables timely resuscitation and antibiotics and prevents subsequent morbidity and mortality. Clinical approaches relying on point-in-time analysis of vital signs or lab values are often insensitive, non-specific and late diagnostic markers of sepsis. Exploring otherwise hidden information within intervals-in-time, heart rate variability (HRV) has been documented to be both altered in the presence of sepsis, and correlated with its severity. We hypothesized that by continuously tracking individual patient HRV over time in patients as they develop sepsis, we would demonstrate reduced HRV in association with the onset of sepsis. Methodology/Principal Findings We monitored heart rate continuously in adult bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients (n = 21) beginning a day before their BMT and continuing until recovery or withdrawal (12±4 days). We characterized HRV continuously over time with a panel of time, frequency, complexity, and scale-invariant domain techniques. We defined baseline HRV as mean variability for the first 24 h of monitoring and studied individual and population average percentage change (from baseline) over time in diverse HRV metrics, in comparison with the time of clinical diagnosis and treatment of sepsis (defined as systemic inflammatory response syndrome along with clinically suspected infection requiring treatment). Of the 21 patients enrolled, 4 patients withdrew, leaving 17 patients who completed the study. Fourteen patients developed sepsis requiring antibiotic therapy, whereas 3 did not. On average, for 12 out of 14 infected patients, a significant (25%) reduction prior to the clinical diagnosis and treatment of sepsis was observed in standard deviation, root mean square successive difference, sample and multiscale entropy, fast Fourier transform, detrended fluctuation analysis, and wavelet variability metrics. For infected patients (n = 14), wavelet HRV demonstrated a 25% drop from baseline 35 h prior to sepsis on average. For 3 out of 3 non-infected patients, all measures, except root mean square successive difference and entropy, showed no significant reduction. Significant correlation was present amongst these HRV metrics for the entire population. Conclusions/Significance Continuous HRV monitoring is feasible in ambulatory patients, demonstrates significant HRV alteration in individual patients in association with, and prior to clinical diagnosis and treatment of sepsis, and merits further investigation as a means of providing early warning of sepsis."

https://openalex.org/W2102004106,"Although the unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) synthetic pathway of Escherichia coli is the prototype of such pathways, several unresolved issues have accumulated over the years. The key players are the fabA and fabB genes. Earlier studies of fabA transcription showed that the gene was transcribed from two promoters, with one being positively regulated by the FadR protein. The other weaker promoter (which could not be mapped with the technology then available) was considered constitutive because its function was independent of FadR. However, the FabR negative regulator was recently shown to represses fabA transcription. We report that the weak promoter overlaps the FadR-dependent promoter and is regulated by FabR. This promoter is strictly conserved in all E. coli and Salmonella enterica genomes sequenced to date and is thought to provide insurance against inappropriate regulation of fabA transcription by exogenous saturated fatty acids. Also, the fabAup promoter, a mutant promoter previously isolated by selection for increased FabA activity, was shown to be a promoter created de novo by a four-base deletion within the gene located immediately upstream of fabA. Demonstration of the key UFA synthetic reaction catalyzed by FabB has been elusive, although it was known to catalyze an elongation reaction. Strains lacking FabB are UFA auxotrophs indicating that the enzyme catalyzes an essential step in UFA synthesis. Using thioesterases specific for hydrolysis of short chain acyl-ACPs, the intermediates of the UFA synthetic pathway have been followed in vivo for the first time. These experiments showed that a fabB mutant strain accumulated less cis-5-dodecenoic acid than the parental wild-type strain. These data indicate that the key reaction in UFA synthesis catalyzed by FabB is elongation of the cis-3-decenoyl-ACP produced by FabA."

https://openalex.org/W2086740370,"NR3A is the only NMDA receptor (NMDAR) subunit that downregulates sharply prior to the onset of sensitive periods for plasticity, yet the functional importance of this transient expression remains unknown. To investigate whether removal/replacement of juvenile NR3A-containing NMDARs is involved in experience-driven synapse maturation, we used a reversible transgenic system that prolonged NR3A expression in the forebrain. We found that removal of NR3A is required to develop strong NMDAR currents, full expression of long-term synaptic plasticity, a mature synaptic organization characterized by more synapses and larger postsynaptic densities, and the ability to form long-term memories. Deficits associated with prolonged NR3A were reversible, as late-onset suppression of transgene expression rescued both synaptic and memory impairments. Our results suggest that NR3A behaves as a molecular brake to prevent the premature strengthening and stabilization of excitatory synapses and that NR3A removal might thereby initiate critical stages of synapse maturation during early postnatal neural development."
https://openalex.org/W2055909694,"Dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) can generate forces to remodel membranes. In cells, DRPs require additional proteins [DRP-associated proteins (DAPs)] to conduct their functions. To dissect the mechanistic role of a DAP, we used the yeast mitochondrial division machine as a model, which requires the DRP Dnm1, and two other proteins, Mdv1 and Fis1. Mdv1 played a postmitochondrial targeting role in division by specifically interacting and coassembling with the guanosine triphosphate-bound form of Dnm1. This regulated interaction nucleated and promoted the self-assembly of Dnm1 into helical structures, which drive membrane scission. The nucleation of DRP assembly probably represents a general regulatory strategy for this family of filament-forming proteins, similar to F-actin regulation."

RNA transcripts produced by RNA pol II are capped at their 5′ ends, often spliced, and processed at their 3′ ends. RNA pol II transcription also generates a stereotypical set of histone modifications, with high levels of methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) at active promoters and H3K36 methylation marking downstream transcribed regions. For both mRNA processing and histone methylation, the relevant enzymes directly bind to the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RNA pol II largest subunit (1Buratowski S. Nat. Struct.

The CTD consists of multiple repeats of the sequence YSPTSPS. Different phosphorylation sites predominate at different stages of transcription, with various accessory proteins binding to specific CTD phosphorylation patterns (3Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J.

There have also been varying reports about whether Ser-5(P) is confined to promoters or persists throughout transcribed regions. Recently, Chapman et al. (26Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K.

Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) generated a new set of monoclonal antibodies with strong specificity for Ser-5(P) (3E8) and Ser-2(P) (3E10), as well as an antibody that recognizes Ser-7(P) (4E12). Here we use these antibodies to confirm that Ser-5(P) levels are highest at promoters, whereas Ser-2(P) levels rise with increasing distance from the promoter. We also help explain why Ser-5(P) levels are usually seen to be highest at promoters but sometimes reported to remain high throughout elongation. Finally, in agreement with a recent report (27Akhtar M.S. Heidemann M. Tietjen J.R. Zhang D.W. Chapman R.D. Eick D. Ansari A.Z. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 387-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we find that yeast CTD is also phosphorylated at Ser-7 and that this phosphorylation is dependent upon the kinase activity of basal transcription factor TFIIH. Ser-7(P) patterns are similar to those of Ser-5(P), and inhibition of Kin28 leads to loss of both phosphorylations. In contrast, deletion of the Ser-5(P) phosphatase Rtr1 (4Mosley A.L. Pattenden S.G.

Twenty or ten microliters of 4E12, 3E8, and 3E10 rat monoclonal antibodies (cell culture supernatant, a generous gift from Dirk Eick, Munich Center for Integrated Protein Science) were prebound to 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated overnight with 400 μl of chromatin solution (∼800 μg of protein) at 4 °C. Beads were then washed sequentially with FA lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) plus 275 mm NaCl, FA lysis buffer plus 500 mm NaCl, ChIP wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), and TE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitated chromatin was eluted from the beads by heating for 10 min at 65 °C in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS and then incubated with Pronase (Roche Applied Science, 1 mg/ml final concentration) for 1 h at 42 °C. Samples were then heated for 5 h at 65 °C to reverse the cross-links. For H14 and H5 ChIP, antibodies and anti-mouse IgM agarose (Sigma A4540) were added simultaneously to chromatin without preincubation. For monoclonal antibody H14, the first two washes were substituted with FA lysis buffer plus 750 mm NaCl. In contrast, H5-precipitated beads were washed with FA lysis buffer plus 150 mm NaCl. After cross-link reversal, samples were processed and assayed by PCR as described previously (28Kim M. Ahn S.H. Krogan N.J. Greenblatt J.F. Buratowski S. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 354-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Native TFIIH and recombinant GST·CTD were purified as described previously (29Keogh M.C. Cho E.J. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare dephosphorylated substrate, 600 μg of GST·CTD were dephosphorylated with 60 units of Antarctic phosphatase (New England Biolabs) in 500 μl of 1× Antarctic phosphatase buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. The protein was then repurified with glutathione-agarose (Sigma), dialyzed overnight in 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C, and stored at −80 °C until use. Kinase reactions were carried out at room temperature in 25 μl of 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 7.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm potassium acetate, 2% glycerol, 25 μm ATP, 200 ng of GST·CTD, and ∼50 ng of purified TFIIH. Reaction products were resolved on a 6.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to an Optitran BA-S 83 reinforced nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman), and analyzed by immunoblotting. Primary antibodies that were used include rat anti-Ser-7(P) (4E12, 1:200), rat anti-Ser-5(P) (3E8, 1:200), rat anti-Ser-2(P) (3E10, 1:200), and mouse anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, B-14, 1:1000) monoclonal antibodies. Peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were anti-rat IgG (Sigma A9037, 1:10,000) or anti-mouse IgG (Sigma A2304, 1:10,000). Signals were developed with the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific) for Ser-5(P) and GST signals and with the SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Thermo Scientific) for Ser-7(P) and Ser-2(P) signals. Kin28-as (analog-sensitive) and isogenic wild-type cells (31Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) were a gift from S. Hahn, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA. Cells were grown to an A595 of 0.3 in synthetic complete medium and treated with either NA-PP1 (Toronto Research Chemicals, final concentration 10 μm) or DMSO (mock) for 2 h. To verify our earlier results using the H5 and H14 antibodies, ChIP experiments were carried out using the new monoclonal antibodies created by Chapman et al. (26Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). On both the PMA1 and the ADH1 mRNA genes, the anti-Ser-2(P) antibody 3E10 showed a pattern very similar to that seen with H5, confirming that Ser-2(P) levels are low near the 5′ end of genes and progressively increase with distance from the promoter (Fig. 1, A and B). On the snR33 snoRNA gene, neither 3E10 nor H5 showed appreciable reactivity, consistent with termination only a few hundred nucleotides downstream of the promoter, before Ser-2(P) reaches detectable levels (Fig. 1C). The anti-Ser-5(P) antibodies H14 and 3E8 both showed strong reactivity at the 5′ ends of genes (Fig. 1, A–C). However, in initial experiments, the 3E8 pattern showed a much stronger signal persisting throughout the transcribed region of longer genes, essentially matching total RNA pol II (not shown). In contrast, H14 reactivity dropped soon after the promoter (Fig. 1, A and B). Although this could indicate that the two antibodies were recognizing different patterns of Ser-5(P), we instead suspected that the 3E8 was more sensitive to lower levels of Ser-5(P) that persist during elongation (3Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). To test this idea, the ChIPs were repeated with less 3E8 antibody (Fig. 2). As predicted, the 3E8 pattern now closely resembled that of H14, with a distinct peak of Ser-5(P) apparent at the promoter. It is also notable that the normalized signal was much higher due to a significant reduction in the non-transcribed background signal. The variation in Ser-5(P) pattern is readily explained by the multi-epitope nature of the CTD. At saturating levels of antibody, any RNA pol II molecules with at least one accessible Ser-5(P) epitope will be precipitated. The results under these conditions correctly lead to the conclusion that some level of Ser-5(P) persists throughout elongation. In contrast, at lower antibody levels, the RNA pol II molecules with the most Ser-5-phosphorylated repeats will be preferentially recognized, leading to the equally correct conclusion that Ser-5(P) levels are highest at promoters. Therefore, the different Ser-5(P) patterns reported are unlikely to be due to the antibodies specifically but rather to the affinity or titer of that specific antibody lot. ChIP of mammalian chromatin using the 4E12 antibody, which reacts with Ser-7(P), indicated that this modification predominated in downstream transcribed regions (26Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Given that this modification was linked specifically to recruitment of snRNA processing factors that are not present in yeast (32Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), it was unclear whether to expect a Ser-7(P) signal in S. cerevisiae. In fact, ChIP in yeast cells with 4E12 gave a very clear signal (Figs. 1 and 2). Surprisingly, the 4E12 signal was strongest at the 5′ ends of genes and decreased with distance from the promoter, similar to the Ser-5(P) pattern. Ser-7(P) was also observed on the short, non-polyadenylated snR33 gene (Fig. 1C). As observed with 3E8, using lower levels of 4E12 antibody accentuated the postpromoter decrease in Ser-7(P). However, a peak of reactivity was also now observed in the polyadenylation site of the PMA1 (but not ADH1) gene (Fig. 2). The source for this reactivity is unclear but suggests that Ser-5(P) and Ser-7(P) are not necessarily tightly linked. Given that the Ser-7(P) pattern resembles that of Ser-5(P), we tested whether the kinase activity of TFIIH subunit Kin28, which phosphorylates CTD Ser-5, might also be necessary for the Ser-7(P) signal. This was done using an altered substrate mutant of Kin28 (Kin28-as) that can be specifically inhibited by the chemical NA-PP1 (31Liu Y. Kung C. Fishburn J. Ansari A.Z. Shokat K.M. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1721-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with NA-PP1 followed by ChIP showed that Ser-5(P) levels were greatly reduced as expected. Furthermore, Ser-7(P) levels were also decreased to near background levels upon Kin28 inhibition (Fig. 3). In contrast, Ser-2(P) and Rpb3 levels were only decreased by about 50–70%, consistent with previous reports by us and others that loss of Kin28 kinase activity, as opposed to Kin28 protein, does not lead to loss of transcription (3Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar, 6Qiu H. Hu C. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, the drop in Ser-7(P) is not an indirect effect caused by cessation of transcription. Because the dependence of Ser-7(P) on Kin28 could be direct or indirect, purified TFIIH was tested for the ability to phosphorylate the CTD on Ser-7 in vitro. TFIIH was purified from yeast extracts as described (29Keogh M.C. Cho E.J. Podolny V. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1288-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 30Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. LaPointe J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28044-28048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated with recombinant GST·CTD produced in bacteria. After incubating the proteins with ATP, the reactions were probed with the new CTD monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 4). As expected, TFIIH produced a strong Ser-5(P) signal but little or no Ser-2(P). It was difficult to interpret the Ser-7(P) result because the GST·CTD produced a positive signal with 4E12 in the absence of any kinase, although a new band appeared that co-migrated with the shifted Ser-5(P) band (Fig. 4A). This result could mean either that 4E12 cross-reacted with unphosphorylated CTD or that some bacterial kinase was phosphorylating the recombinant GST·CTD. To distinguish between these possibilities, the GST·CTD was incubated with phosphatase and the experiment was repeated (Fig. 4B). This treatment led to loss of the kinase-independent Ser-7(P) signal, indicating that GST·CTD produced in bacteria is already phosphorylated at Ser-7. However, dephosphorylated GST·CTD incubated with purified TFIIH and ATP clearly reacted with anti-Ser-7(P) antibody, indicating that TFIIH can directly phosphorylate this residue. The Rtr1 protein was recently shown to be responsible for dephosphorylation of Ser-5(P) during elongation, with Ser-5(P) being assayed by reactivity with the H14 antibody (4Mosley A.L. Pattenden S.G. Carey M. Venkatesh S. Gilmore J.M. Florens L. Workman J.L. Washburn M.P. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 168-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An rtr1Δ strain was tested with 3E8 and 4E12 antibodies (Fig. 2). As reported previously, a large increase in Ser-5(P) levels was observed, particularly in downstream transcribed regions. In contrast, levels of Ser-7(P) did not increase. This suggests that Rtr1 may be specific for Ser-5(P) and that there could be a distinct phosphatase that targets Ser-7(P). The proposal that Ser-5(P) marks active promoters, whereas Ser-2(P) gradually increases with distance from the promoter, was based on ChIP experiments using the H14 and H5 monoclonal antibodies (3Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The Ser-5(P)/Ser-2(P) pattern has now been confirmed using an independently derived set of monoclonal antibodies (26Chapman R.D. Heidemann M. Albert T.K. Mailhammer R. Flatley A. Meisterernst M. Kremmer E. Eick D. Science. 2007; 318: 1780-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In the process of characterizing the new antibodies, some insight was gained into the variability that has been reported as to whether Ser-5(P) is limited to promoters or persists throughout elongation. We believe that this variability is due to the repetitive nature of the CTD. At saturating antibody titers, a single phosphorylated repeat should be sufficient to precipitate RNA pol II. Under these conditions, it becomes clear that some level of Ser-5(P) persists throughout elongation. However, because there is no distinction between RNA pol II molecules that are highly phosphorylated and those with low levels, the immunoprecipitation signal is not linearly responsive to the number of epitopes. In contrast, at subsaturating antibody titers, there is clearly greater reactivity at promoters. This is presumably due to the increased probability of an antibody molecule reacting with a CTD that contains many phosphorylated repeats. This hypothesis helps to explain several earlier observations. First, we have noted variability between different lots of H14 antibody, with only some batches showing appreciable signals in internal transcribed regions (3Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Inconsistent antibody titers are likely to contribute to variability. H14 is an IgM, a class of multivalent antibodies, which may result in H14 binding being highly cooperative when multiple Ser-5(P) sites are encountered, further enhancing non-linearity of reactivity. Second, ChIPs in mammalian and Drosophila cells, which have a greater number of CTD repeats per polymerase molecule, often show a robust H14 signal in downstream transcribed regions. Third, deletion of the CTD phosphatase Rtr1 in yeast leads to a high H14 signal extending throughout the transcribed region, consistent with an increased number of Ser-5(P) epitopes being generated (4Mosley A.L. Pattenden S.G. Carey M. Venkatesh S. Gilmore J.M. Florens L. Workman J.L. Washburn M.P. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 168-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In any case, the variation in ChIP patterns seen with different amounts of antibodies should be taken into consideration when comparing different reports and serves to underscore the need for additional approaches to characterize CTD phosphorylation patterns. The existence of Ser-7(P) in S. cerevisiae is interesting and unexpected. The only role assigned to Ser-7(P) so far is in recruiting the mammalian snRNA 3′-processing complex Integrator (32Egloff S. O'Reilly D. Chapman R.D. Taylor A. Tanzhaus K. Pitts L. Eick D. Murphy S. Science. 2007; 318: 1777-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Given that S. cerevisiae does not contain an Integrator-like complex, it remains to be seen whether Ser-7(P) has an undiscovered function. It is interesting that the Ser-7(P) ChIP pattern is similar but not always identical to Ser-5(P), and Ser-7(P) does not appear to be targeted by the Ser-5(P) phosphatase Rtr1. We also observed Ser-7 phosphorylation on recombinant GST·CTD made in Escherichia coli, a finding that must be taken into consideration when using bacterially produced CTD for binding experiments. Serine 7 is the most degenerate position of the CTD (34Allison L.A. Wong J.K. Fitzpatrick V.D. Moyle M. Ingles C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Only about half of the human repeats, mostly in the N-terminal half of the CTD, has a serine at position 7. In Drosophila, the number is even less, with only 7 out of 44 repeats containing a Ser-7. The divergence at this position has led to speculation that the non-consensus repeats may have evolved specific functions not shared with consensus repeats. Further experiments will be required to discern its function, but the fact that Ser-7 phosphorylation appears widely conserved over evolution suggests that this modification could be important at some stage of the CTD cycle. We thank Dirk Eick for CTD antibodies, Steve Hahn for the Kin28-as strain, Michael Keogh for GST·CTD, and Dirk Eick and Aseem Ansari for sharing information before publication."

Here, we present such a tool, RC::PFtox, that harnesses breadth in scope along with high cell-type selection via combinatorial gene expression to deliver tetanus toxin light chain (tox), an inhibitor of vesicular neurotransmission. When applied in mice, we observed cell-type-specific disruption of vesicle exocytosis accompanied by loss of excitatory postsynaptic currents and commensurately perturbed behaviors. Among various test populations, we applied RC::PFtox to silence serotonergic neurons, en masse or a subset defined combinatorially. Of the behavioral phenotypes observed upon en masse serotonergic silencing, only one mapped to the combinatorially defined subset. These findings provide evidence for separability by genetic lineage of serotonin-modulated behaviors; collectively, these findings demonstrate broad utility of RC::PFtox for dissecting neuron functions."
https://openalex.org/W2002055235,"In mammals, fat store levels are communicated by leptin and insulin signaling to brain centers that regulate food intake and metabolism. By using transgenic manipulation of neural activity, we report the isolation of two distinct neuronal populations in flies that perform a similar function, the c673a-Gal4 and fruitless-Gal4 neurons. When either of these neuronal groups is silenced, fat store levels increase. This change is mediated through an increase in food intake and altered metabolism in c673a-Gal4-silenced flies, while silencing fruitless-Gal4 neurons alters only metabolism. Hyperactivation of either neuronal group causes depletion of fat stores by increasing metabolic rate and decreasing fatty acid synthesis. Altering the activities of these neurons causes changes in expression of genes known to regulate fat utilization. Our results show that the fly brain measures fat store levels and can induce changes in food intake and metabolism to maintain them within normal limits."

Pharmacological inhibitors of the iron-dependent enzyme class prolyl hydroxylases (PHD), which target alpha subunits of HIF proteins for degradation, have recently been demonstrated to alleviate neurodegeneration associated with stroke and hypoxic-ischemic injuries. Here we report that inhibition of PHD by 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (DHB) protects against 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced nigral dopaminergic cell loss and up-regulates HIF-1alpha within these neurons. Elevations in mRNA and protein levels of HIF-dependent genes heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1) and manganese superoxide dismutase (Mnsod) following DHB pretreatment alone are also maintained in the presence of MPTP. MPTP-induced reductions in ferroportin and elevations in nigral and striatal iron levels were reverted to levels comparable with that of untreated controls with DHB pretreatment. Reductions in pyruvate dehydrogenase mRNA and activity resulting from MPTP were also found to be attenuated by DHB. In vitro, the HIF pathway was activated in N27 cells grown at 3% oxygen treated with either PHD inhibitors or an iron chelator. Concordant with our in vivo data, the MPP(+)-elicited increase in total iron as well as decreases in cell viability were attenuated in the presence of DHB. Taken together, these data suggest that protection against MPTP neurotoxicity may be mediated by alterations in iron homeostasis and defense against oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction brought about by cellular HIF-1alpha induction. This study provides novel data extending the possible therapeutic utility of HIF induction to a Parkinson disease model of neurodegeneration, which may prove beneficial not only in this disorder itself but also in other diseases associated with metal-induced oxidative stress."

Despite the importance for plasticity of inhibitory transmission, less is known about cellular mechanisms involved in more dynamic changes in KCC2 function. In this study, we investigated the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in KCC2 localization and function in hippocampal neurons and in cultured GT1-7 cells. Mutation to the putative tyrosine phosphorylation site within the long intracellular carboxyl terminus of KCC2(Y1087D) or application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein shifted the GABA reversal potential (<i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub>) to more depolarized values, indicating reduced KCC2 function. This was associated with a change in the expression pattern of KCC2 from a punctate distribution to a more uniform distribution, suggesting that functional tyrosine-phosphorylated KCC2 forms clusters in restricted membrane domains. Sodium vanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, increased the proportion of KCC2 associated with lipid rafts membrane domains. Loss of tyrosine phosphorylation also reduced oligomerization of KCC2. A loss of the punctuate distribution and oligomerization of KCC2 and a more depolarized <i>E</i><sub>GABA</sub> were seen when the 28-amino-acid carboxyl terminus of KCC2 was deleted. These results indicate that direct tyrosine phosphorylation of KCC2 results in membrane clusters and functional transport activity, suggesting a mechanism by which intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> concentrations and GABA responses can be rapidly modulated."

Thirteen of these coincide with previously unidentified gamma-ray sources, solving the 30-year-old mystery of their identities. Pulsars are fast-rotating neutron stars. With time they slow down and cease to radiate; however, if they are in a binary system, they can have their spin rates increased by mass transfer from their companion stars, starting a new life as millisecond pulsars. In another study, Abdo et al. (p. 845 ) report the detection of gamma-ray emission from the globular cluster 47 Tucanae, which is coming from an ensemble of millisecond pulsars in the cluster's core. The data imply that there are up to 60 millisecond pulsars in 47 Tucanae, twice as many as predicted by radio observations. In a further companion study, Abdo et al. (p. 848 , published online 2 July) searched Fermi Large Area Telescope data for pulsations from all known millisecond pulsars outside of stellar clusters, finding gamma-ray pulsations for eight of them. Their properties resemble those of other gamma-ray pulsars, suggesting that they share the same basic emission mechanism. Indeed, both sets of pulsars favor emission models in which the gamma rays are produced in the outer magnetosphere of the neutron star."
https://openalex.org/W2069293496,"The amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and its pathogenic byproduct β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) play central roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Reduction in levels of the potentially toxic Aβ is one of the most important therapeutic goals in AD. Recent studies have shown that bivalent metals such as iron, copper, and zinc are involved in APP expression, Aβ deposition, and senile plaque formation in the AD brain. However, the underlying mechanisms involved in abnormal homeostasis of bivalent metals in AD brain remain unclear. In the present study, we found that two isoforms of the divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1), DMT1-IRE, and DMTl-nonIRE, were colocalized with Aβ in the plaques of postmortem AD brain. Using the APP/PS1 transgenic mouse model, we found that the levels of both DMT1-IRE and DMT1-nonlRE were significantly increased in the cortex and hippocampus compared with wild type-control. We further verified the proposed mechanisms by which DMT1 might be involved in APP processing and Aβ secretion by using the SH-SY5Y cell line stably overex-pressing human APP Swedish mutation (APPsw) as a cell model. We found that overexpression of APPsw resulted in increased expression levels of both DMT1-IRE and DMTl-nonIRE in SH-SY5Y cells. Interestingly, silencing of endogenous DMT1 by RNA interference, which reduced bivalent ion influx, led to reductions of APP expression and Aß secretion. These findings suggest both that DMT1 plays a critical role in ion-mediated neuropathogenesis in AD and that pharmacological blockage of DMT1 may provide novel therapeutic strategies against AD.—Zheng, W., Xin, N., Chi, Z.-H., Zhao, B.-L., Zhang, J., Li, J.-Y., Wang, Z.-Y.

https://openalex.org/W2166927274,"Voltage-gated potassium (Kv)1.5 is decreased in pulmonary arteries (PAs) of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and in experimental models including mice with SM22α-targeted overexpression of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT). The mechanisms underlying these abnormalities, however, remain unknown. Di-chloroacetate (DCA) inhibits chronic hypoxia- or monocrotaline-induced PAH by inhibiting nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT)c2 and increasing Kv1.5. Therefore, we hypothesized that DCA could regress established PAH in SM22-5-HTT+ mice. We evaluated pulmonary hemodynamics, vascular remodeling, NFATc2, and Kv1.5 protein in 20-wk-old SM22-5-HTT+ or wild-type mice treated for 1, 7, and 21 d with DCA, cyclosporine-A (NFAT inhibitor), or vehicle. DCA partially reversed PAH in SM22-5- HTT+ mice by decreasing proliferation and increasing apoptosis in muscularized PAs. Furthermore, serotonin (10−8-10−6M) dose-dependently increased PA-smooth muscle cell (PA-SMC) proliferation in culture (EC50 = 0.97× 10−7M) and DCA (5×10−4 M) vs. PBS markedly reduced the growth of PA-SMC from IPAH and control patients treated with the highest dose of serotonin by 50 and 30%, respectively. Finally, although serotonin induces NFATc2 activation in PA-SMCs, inhibition of NFATc2 alone with cyclosporine-A was not sufficient for reversing PAH in this model. Our results support the possibility that DCA may be an interesting agent for investigation in patients with PAH.—Guignabert, C., Tu, L., Izikki, M., Dewachter, L., Zadigue, P., Humbert, M., Adnot, S., Fadel, É., Eddahibi, S.

https://openalex.org/W2048412291,"MyD88 couples the activation of the Toll-like receptors and interleukin-1 receptor superfamily with intracellular signaling pathways. Upon ligand binding, activated receptors recruit MyD88 via its Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain. MyD88 then allows the recruitment of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs). We performed a site-directed mutagenesis of MyD88 residues, conserved in death domains of the homologous FADD and Pelle proteins, and analyzed the effect of the mutations on MyD88 signaling. Our studies revealed that mutation of residues 52 (MyD88E52A) and 58 (MyD88Y58A) impaired recruitment of both IRAK1 and IRAK4, whereas mutation of residue 95 (MyD88K95A) only affected IRAK4 recruitment. Since all MyD88 mutants were defective in signaling, recruitment of both IRAKs appeared necessary for activation of the pathway. Moreover, overexpression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged mini-MyD88 protein (GFP-MyD88-(27–72)), comprising the Glu52 and Tyr58 residues, interfered with recruitment of both IRAK1 and IRAK4 by MyD88 and suppressed NF-κB activation by the interleukin-1 receptor but not by the MyD88-independent TLR3. GFP-MyD88-(27–72) exerted its effect by titrating IRAK1 and suppressing IRAK1-dependent NF-κB activation.

Oncogene. 1990; 5: 387-396PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent investigations revealed that MyD88 possesses a modular organization (2Hardiman G. Rock F.L. Balasubramanian S. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 144-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MyD88 also has an intermediate domain (ID) that is crucial in TLR signaling due to its interaction with IRAK4 (6Burns K. Janssens S. Brissoni B. Olivos N. Beyaert R. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The role of MyD88 as a signal transducer was first shown in the pathways triggered by the activation of IL-1R (7Muzio M. Ni J.

By virtue of its modular organization, MyD88 critically bridges activated receptor complexes to downstream adaptors/effectors. Upon activation, MyD88 is recruited through its TIR domain by the homologous domain of the activated TLR/IL-1R (11Ulrichts P. Peelman F. Beyaert R. Tavernier J.

MyD88, in turn, has been shown to interact with a family of downstream kinases, namely IRAK1 (13Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar), IRAK2 (7Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), and IRAK4 (16Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), through the interaction of its DD with the respective DDs present in the amino-terminal region of IRAKs (17Neumann D. Kollewe C. Resch K. Martin M.U. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 1089-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). At this stage, this multimeric complex is competent to elicit the propagation of the signal downstream of the receptor(s). Although MyD88 recruits IRAK-1 via DD-DD interactions, its recruitment of IRAK-4 appears to be rather unusual. Burns et al. (6Burns K. Janssens S. Brissoni B. Olivos N. Beyaert R. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) first demonstrated that an alternatively spliced variant of MyD88 (MyD88s), lacking the ID domain, failed to interact with IRAK-4, suggesting that residues located in both the DD and ID of MyD88 are crucially involved in the recruitment of IRAK-4. Nevertheless, no information is available on the specific residues in the DD in MyD88 required for its interaction with either IRAK1 or IRAK4. The DD was initially defined as the region of homology between the cytoplasmic tails of the FAS/Apo1/CD95 and TNF receptors required for their induction of cytotoxic signaling (18Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 19Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In analogy with other DD-containing proteins, this domain in MyD88 is also involved in the formation of homomeric and heteromeric interactions. Herein, we have undertaken an alanine-scanning mutational analysis to identify amino acids that are required for downstream signaling and might participate in the homomeric and heteromeric interactions. Our studies revealed that MyD88E52A and MyD88Y58A mutants are strongly impaired in the recruitment of both IRAK1 and IRAK4, whereas the MyD88K95A mutant is deficient in recruiting IRAK4. These findings identify residues within the DD of MyD88 crucially involved in the formation of higher order complexes containing IRAK1 and IRAK4 and required for the propagation of the TLR/IL1-R signaling pathways. Expression vectors for FLAG-tagged MyD88 or Myc-tagged MyD88, Myc-tagged IRAK1-kinase-dead (IRAK1KD) (K239S) and Myc-tagged IRAK4KD (K213A/K214A) were constructed by inserting PCR-generated cDNA fragments in the mammalian expression vectors p3X-FLAG and pCDNA3-N2-Myc, respectively. All site-directed mutations were inserted by PCR using oligonucleotides containing the mutated residue. Constructs for GFP-MyD88 fusion protein expression were obtained by subcloning cDNA encoding each protein into pEGFP-c1 vector. All constructs were confirmed by Cycle Sequencing (BMR Genomics, Padua, Italy). For the NF-κB reporter assays, the NF-κB luciferase and Renilla luciferase constructs were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy). The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T and HeLa cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and grown at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. For co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-MyD88/Myc-MyD88, HEK293T cells were first cultured in 10-cm diameter dishes and then transfected by the calcium phosphate method with 4–5 μg of the appropriate plasmids. To detect FLAG-MyD88 associated with Myc-IRAK1KD or Myc-IRAK4KD and GFP-MyD88-(27–72) associated with Myc-IRAK4KD, Myc-IRAK1KD, or Myc-MyD88, HEK293T cells were cultured in 6-cm diameter dishes and transfected by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immnunofluorescence analysis, HeLa cells were cultured in 3-cm diameter dishes and transfected with constructs for GFP or GFP-MyD88-(27–72) expression by FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293T cells were collected 20 h after transfection, washed in ice-cold PBS, and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors. After incubating for 10 min on ice, cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and cytosolic fractions were collected for immunoprecipitation. Cell extracts (1 mg of total proteins) were precleared by incubation for 1 h with protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) under constant shaking at 4 °C. After preclearing, cell extracts were incubated with 2 μg of mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma) or rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 1 h under constant shaking at 4 °C. Concurrently, protein G-Sepharose beads or protein A-Sepharose beads were presaturated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS in the same conditions for 1 h. After incubation, the beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and then further incubated with cell extracts containing the antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C under constant shaking. Sepharose bead-bound immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer and eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis. Cell extracts or immunoprecipitated proteins were diluted in SDS sample buffer, as described above, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 8–10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore S.p.A., Vimodrone, Italy) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were saturated with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-Myc and rabbit anti-Erk2 (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-FLAG M2 and mouse anti-β tubulin (1:3000 and 1:1000 dilution, respectively; Sigma), and rabbit anti-GFP antibodies (1:1000 dilution; Molecular Probes). Secondary anti-mouse IgGs conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature at a 1:10,000 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Immunostained bands were detected by chemiluminescence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). HeLa cells (1 × 105) were cultured in 12-well plates and transfected with 0.5 μg of an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene and Renilla luciferase reporter gene (4 ng) as an internal control together with the constructs for expression of MyD88 mutants or GFP-MyD88 fusion proteins by using the FuGENE 6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were stimulated or not with 30 ng/ml IL-1β (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or 100 μg/ml poly(I-C) (Invivogen, San Diego, CA) for 6 h. After rinsing with PBS, the cells were harvested in two tubes and lysed separately. For biocounter luminometer analysis, the cells were lysed in 250 μl of passive lysis buffer (dual luciferase reporter assay system; Promega Italia S.r.l., Milan, Italy) for 15 min at room temperature. Cell lysates were cleared for 30 s by centrifugation at top speed in a refrigerated microcentrifuge and transferred to a fresh tube prior to reporter enzyme analysis. Ten μl of cell lysates were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay reagent II (Promega), and the NF-κB-firefly luciferase activity was determined using a biocounter luminometer. For the assessment of Renilla luciferase activity, 100 μl of Stop & Glo® reagent were added to the same sample. For all samples, the reporter data were normalized for transfection efficiency by dividing firefly luciferase activity by that of the Renilla luciferase. Data are expressed as mean -fold induction ± S.D. from a minimum of three separate experiments. To analyze the expression of the MyD88 mutants or GFP-MyD88 fusion proteins, HeLa cells were lysed in 30 μl of buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4). Cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were diluted in SDS sample buffer for Western blot analysis of levels of wild type or mutated MyD88 or GFP-MyD88 fusion proteins, respectively. HeLa cells were cultured in 3-cm diameter dishes and transfected with constructs for GFP or GFP-MyD88-(27–72) expression by FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty h after transfection, HeLa cells expressing GFP or GFP-MyD88-(27–72) were stimulated with 20 ng/ml IL-1β for 20 min at 37 °C. The cells were fixed at room temperature for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized at room temperature for 30 min with 0.5% Tween 20, 10% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After two washes in PBS, the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-p65 NF-κB antibodies (1:500 dilution in PBS with 1% goat serum; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies (1: 500 dilution in PBS; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Hoechst dye (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma) was added during the last 10 min of incubation to stain the nuclei. Slides were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 reagent (Calbiochem). Densitometric analysis of the Western blots was performed using underexposed images from 3–5 experiments and analyzed by ImageQuant version 5.0 software. Statistical significance was determined using the two-tailed Student's t test. In order to delineate the relevant residues within the DD of MyD88 required for self-association and for interaction with downstream components of the pathway, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of selected residues. Previous mutagenesis studies carried out on FADD DD (20Jeong E.J. Bang S. Lee T.H. Park Y.I. Sim W.S. Kim K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16337-16342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and Pelle DD (21Xiao T. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) highlighted the importance of polar/charged amino acids located on helices α2, α3, and α5 and loops α2-α3 and α4-α5 for the association with their partners Fas DD and Tube DD. For the alignment of human and mouse MyD88 and IRAK1 DD with homologous protein domains, we used the ClustalW algorithm (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55709) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). A structural alignment of the DD of homologous proteins was performed using the available crystallographic/NMR data and the Swiss-Pdb viewer (23Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9578) Google Scholar). The amino acids shown in boldface type (Fig. 1) in human MyD88 were substituted with alanine or asparagine (Arg81), and the effect on protein function was tested by assaying downstream activation of NF-κB caused by overexpression of MyD88 in the HeLa human cell line. Co-transfection of wild type or mutant MyD88 with a reporter construct containing NF-κB-responsive elements upstream of the firefly luciferase gene confirmed that wild type MyD88 triggers activation of NF-κB even in the absence of exogenous stimuli (Fig. 1B) (24Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). On the other hand, several mutations strongly affected MyD88 function. The E52A/E53A, Y58A, and K95A mutations reduced NF-κB activation by almost 60% (Fig. 1B, gray bars), whereas the R81N mutation was slightly less effective. The other MyD88 mutants analyzed activated NF-κB to a similar extent as wild type MyD88. All of the MyD88 proteins tested were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, single substitution of Glu52 or Glu53 to alanine indicated that the first glutamic acid residue (Glu52) is the one required for full function of MyD88, whereas E53A behaved similarly to the wild type protein. These results indicate that residues Glu52 (predicted in helix α2), Tyr58 (predicted in helix α3), and Lys95 (predicted in helix α5) are required for MyD88 activity. Death domains have six anti-parallel α-helices, arranged in a Greek key structure (25Berglund H. Olerenshaw D. Sankar A. Federwisch M. McDonald N.Q. Driscoll P.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The DD can fold to offer different surfaces of homomeric interactions (26Park H.H. Logette E. Raunser S. Cuenin S. Walz T. Tschopp J. Wu H. Cell. 2007; 128: 533-546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the case of MyD88, the DD self-associates and also binds to the DDs of IRAKs (7Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 8Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). To determine which of these functions were disrupted in the MyD88 loss-of-function mutants, we first tested their ability to recruit wild type MyD88 by a co-immunoprecipitation assay (28Loiarro M. Capolunghi F. Fantò N. Gallo G. Campo S. Arseni B. Carsetti R. Carminati P. De Santis R. Ruggiero V. Sette C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2007; 82: 801-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged wild type or mutated MyD88 and wild type Myc-tagged MyD88. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and association with the wild type protein was tested by detecting Myc-MyD88 in the immunoprecipitates. Remarkably, none of the mutations impaired MyD88 self-association (Fig. 2, A and B), demonstrating that the Glu52, Tyr58, and Lys95 residues are not required for MyD88 self-association. Next, we tested whether the signaling-defective MyD88 mutants were impaired in their ability to associate with IRAK1 and IRAK4. Since the interaction between MyD88 and these kinases is rapid and transient, it can be reproducibly detected only by expressing kinase-dead IRAK1 and IRAK4 (IRAK1KD and IRAK4KD) (8Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W. Li S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 16Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5567-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Hence, wild type or mutant FLAG-tagged MyD88 proteins were co-expressed with either Myc-tagged IRAK1KD (Fig. 2C) or IRAK4KD (Fig. 2E), and cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. We observed a strong interaction between wild type MyD88 and IRAK1KD or IRAK4KD (lane 1 in Fig. 2, C and E). By contrast, MyD88E52A/E53A, MyD88E52A, and MyD88Y58A were impaired in the recruitment of both IRAK1KD (Fig. 2C) and IRAK4KD (Fig. 2E). In line with its ability to elicit NF-κB activation, MyD88E53A behaved like the wild type protein in the recruitment of both IRAKs (Fig. 2, C and E). Interestingly, mutation of the Lys95 residue exerted a different effect on MyD88 interaction with the two kinases. Indeed, whereas it strongly bound to IRAK1KD (Fig. 2, C and D), MyD88K95A interacted less efficiently than the wild type protein with IRAK4KD (Fig. 2, E and F). These findings highlight novel amino acid residues, within the DD of MyD88, that are crucial for the recruitment of IRAK1 and IRAK4 but not for its self-association. Our results suggested that residues 52–95 define a subregion of the MyD88 DD domain required for the interaction with IRAK1 and IRAK4. To determine whether expression of different regions of MyD88 DD affected IL1-R signal transduction, we produced a series of GFP-MyD88 fusion proteins containing portions of this domain, as schematically represented in Fig. 3A. We reasoned that these chimeric proteins might exert a dominant-negative effect on the endogenous MyD88 by titrating out IRAKs without triggering NF-κB activation. Using a reporter gene assay, we tested whether overexpressed GFP or GFP-MyD88 fusion proteins were able to interfere with IL-1-mediated activation of NF-κB. We found that GFP-MyD88-(27–72), GFP-MyD88-(30–66), and GFP-MyD88-(44–110) significantly reduced IL-1-dependent activation of NF-κB (by approximately 40, 30 and 25%, respectively; p < 0.01; Fig. 3B). Remarkably, the effect of the GFP-MyD88 DD proteins was specific, since they did not inhibit activation of NF-κB by the MyD88-independent (29Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar) poly(I-C)/TLR3 pathway (Fig. 3B). By contrast, GFP-MyD88-(27–45), MyD88-(40–72), and GFP-MyD88-(68–172) did not exert significant effects on either IL-1-dependent or poly(I-C)-dependent activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3B). Similar amounts of chimeric proteins were expressed in the samples (Fig. 3C). Since GFP-MyD88-(27–72) exerted the strongest inhibition of NF-κB transcriptional activity, which relies on its translocation from cytoplasm to the nucleus (30Ding G.J. Fischer P.A. Boltz R.C. Schmidt J.A. Colaianne J.J. Gough A. Rubin R.A. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28897-28905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), we also tested whether overexpression of GFP-MyD88-(27–72) interfered with the subcellular localization of the p65/NF-κB protein. In non-stimulated cells, p65 was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, A and C). Stimulation with IL-1β for 20 min caused the translocation of p65 into the nucleus of GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). However, in cells expressing GFP-MyD88-(27–72) (Fig. 4, G and H), we found that significant amounts of p65 remained in the cytoplasm after IL-1β treatment (indicated by the arrows in Fig. 4D). Taken together, these results suggest that GFP-MyD88-(27–72) attenuates MyD88-dependent activation of NF-κB, probably by exerting a dominant negative effect on MyD88 function in live cells.FIGURE 4GFP-MyD88-(27–72) interferes with the subcellular localization of the p65/NF-κB protein. Immunofluorescence analysis of the effect of GFP-MyD88-(27–72) on nuclear translocation of endogenous NF-κB p65. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP or GFP-MyD88-(27–72) (panels E and F and panels G and H, respectively). Twenty h after transfection, the cells were left untreated (panels A, E, I, and O and panels C, G, M, and Q) or treated with 20 ng/ml IL-1β for 20 min (panels B, F, L, and P and panels D, H, N, and R). Cells were fixed, blocked, and stained with anti-NF-κB p65 antibodies (red) and Hoechst (blue) for nuclear staining. Nuclear NF-κB p65 is observed 20 min after treatment with IL-1β in the cells expressing GFP, but it is held back in the cytoplasm in those expressing GFP-MyD88-(27–72) (indicated by an arrow in D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further investigate the inhibitory effect of GFP-MyD88-(27–72) on MyD88 signaling, we analyzed its ability to bind full-length MyD88 and IRAK1/4 by co-immunoprecipitation assays. GFP or GFP-MyD88-(27–72) were co-expressed in HEK293T cells with MyD88, IRAK1KD, or IRAK4KD. Western blot analysis showed that GFP-MyD88-(27–72) strongly interacted with IRAK1KD (Fig. 5A), whereas it bound very weakly to either IRAK4KD (Fig. 5A) or full-length MyD88 (Fig. 5A). The association of GFP-MyD88-(27–72) with IRAK1KD was comparable with that of full-length MyD88 (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the miniprotein folded correctly and maintained the original structure. This result suggests that this region of MyD88 is sufficient to associate with IRAK1. To test whether the inhibitory effect of GFP-MyD88-(27–72) was due to its ability to titrate out IRAK1, we performed co- immunoprecipitation assays between MyD88 and IRAK1KD in HEK293T cells expressing either GFP or GFP-MyD88-(27–72). As shown in Fig. 6A, GFP-MyD88-(27–72) was able to significantly inhibit (p < 0.01) IRAK1KD recruitment by MyD88 by ∼70%. This effect was specific, because in similar experiments, GFP-MyD88-(27–72) did not interfere with MyD88 self-association (Fig. 6B). To test whether inhibition of IRAK1 recruitment also affected the interaction of MyD88 with IRAK4, we co-expressed all components of the complex together with GFP or GFP-MyD88-(27–72). Co-immunoprecipitation assays of MyD88 with IRAK1KD and IRAK4KD in HEK293T cells showed that GFP-MyD88-(27–72) also prevents the recruitment of IRAK4 by MyD88 (Fig. 6C).FIGURE 6GFP-MyD88-(27–72) interferes with recruitment of IRAK1 and IRAK4 by MyD88.

Twenty h after transfection, the cells were collected, and the effect of either GFP or GFP-MyD88-(27–72) on the interaction of FLAG-MyD88 with Myc-IRAK1KD was evaluated by co-immunoprecipitation. Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG antibodies, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting with either anti-FLAG or anti-Myc antibodies to detect association.

https://openalex.org/W2074132685,"The entorhinal cortex provides both direct and indirect inputs to hippocampal CA1 neurons through the perforant path and Schaffer collateral synapses, respectively. Using both two-photon imaging of synaptic vesicle cycling and electrophysiological recordings, we found that the efficacy of transmitter release at perforant path synapses is lower than at Schaffer collateral inputs. This difference is due to the greater contribution to release by presynaptic N-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels at the Schaffer collateral than perforant path synapses. Induction of long-term potentiation that depends on activation of NMDA receptors and L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels enhances the low efficacy of release at perforant path synapses by increasing the contribution of N-type channels to exocytosis. This represents a previously uncharacterized presynaptic mechanism for fine-tuning release properties of distinct classes of synapses onto a common postsynaptic neuron and for regulating synaptic function during long-term synaptic plasticity."

In Ca2+-activated skinned fibers from psoas muscle, we determined the Ca2+ dependence of isometric force and stiffness, the rate of force redevelopment after unloaded shortening (kTR), the power during isotonic shortening, and the unloaded shortening velocity (V0). Our results show a 65% reduction in isometric force in nebulin-/- fibers at saturating [Ca2+], whereas neither thin-filament length nor the Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile system is affected. Stiffness measurements indicate that the reduction in isometric force is due to a reduction in the number of actin-attached myosin motors, whereas the force of the motor is unchanged. Furthermore, in nebulin-/- fibers, kTR is decreased by 57%, V0 is increased by 63%, and the maximum power is decreased by 80%. These results indicate that, in the absence of nebulin, the attachment probability of the myosin motors to actin is decreased, revealing a direct role for nebulin in promoting strong actomyosin interactions responsible for force and power production.— Bang, M.-L., Caremani, M., Brunello, E., Littlefield, R., Lieber, R.

https://openalex.org/W1977351673,"Allosteric kinase inhibitors hold promise for revealing unique features of kinases that may not be apparent using conventional ATP-competitive inhibitors. Here we explore the activity of a previously reported allosteric inhibitor of BCR-Abl kinase, GNF-2, against two cellular isoforms of Abl tyrosine kinase: one that carries a myristate in the N terminus and the other that is deficient in N-myristoylation. Our results show that GNF-2 inhibits the kinase activity of non-myristoylated c-Abl more potently than that of myristoylated c-Abl by binding to the myristate-binding pocket in the C-lobe of the kinase domain. Unexpectedly, indirect immunofluorescence reveals a translocation of myristoylated c-Abl to the endoplasmic reticulum in GNF-2-treated cells, whereas GNF-2 has no detectable effect on the localization of non-myristoylated c-Abl. These results indicate that GNF-2 competes with the NH(2)-terminal myristate for binding to the c-Abl kinase myristate-binding pocket and that the exposed myristoyl group accounts for the localization to the endoplasmic reticulum. We also demonstrate that GNF-2 can inhibit enzymatic and cellular kinase activity of Arg, a kinase highly homologous to c-Abl, which is also likely to be regulated through intramolecular binding of an NH(2)-terminal myristate lipid. These results suggest that non-ATP-competitive inhibitors, such as GNF-2, can serve as chemical tools that can discriminate between c-Abl isoform-specific behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W1973788927,"Erv1p is a FAD-dependent sulfhydryl oxidase of the mitochondrial intermembrane space. It contains three conserved disulfide bonds arranged in two CXXC motifs and one CX(16)C motif. Experimental evidence for the specific roles of the individual disulfide bonds is lacking. In this study, structural and functional roles of the disulfides were dissected systematically using a wide range of biochemical and biophysical methods. Three double cysteine mutants with each pair of cysteines mutated to serines were generated. All of the mutants were purified with the normal FAD binding properties as the wild type Erv1p, showing that none of the three disulfides are essential for FAD binding. Thermal denaturation and trypsin digestion studies showed that the CX(16)C disulfide plays an important role in stabilizing the folding of Erv1p. To understand the functional role of each disulfide, small molecules and the physiological substrate protein Mia40 were used as electron donors in oxygen consumption assays. We show that both CXXC disulfides are required for Erv1 oxidase activity. The active site disulfide is well protected thus requires the shuttle disulfide for its function. Although both mutants of the CXXC motifs were individually inactive, Erv1p activity was partially recovered by mixing these two mutants together, and the recovery was rapid. Thus, we provided the first experimental evidence of electron transfer between the shuttle and active site disulfides of Erv1p, and we propose that both intersubunit and intermolecular electron transfer can occur."
https://openalex.org/W1982671296,"The nucleolus is a subnuclear compartment with multiple cellular functions, including ribosome biogenesis. USP36 is a deubiquitylating enzyme that localizes to nucleoli and plays an essential role in regulating the structure and function of the organelle. However, how the localization of USP36 is regulated remains unknown. Here, we identified a short stretch of basic amino acids (RGKEKKIKKFKREKRR) that resides in the C-terminal region of USP36 and serves as a nucleolar localization signal for the protein. We found that this motif interacts with a central acidic region of nucleophosmin/B23, a major nucleolar protein involved in various nucleolar functions. Knockdown of nucleophosmin/B23 resulted in a significant reduction in the amount of USP36 in nucleoli, without affecting the cellular USP36 level. This was associated with elevated ubiquitylation levels of fibrillarin, a USP36 substrate protein in nucleoli. We conclude that nucleophosmin/B23 recruits USP36 to nucleoli, thereby serving as a platform for the regulation of nucleolar protein functions through ubiquitylation/deubiquitylation."
https://openalex.org/W2095996466,"Growing evidence shows that trafficking of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is a critical process in functional recovery from desensitization following activation and plays important roles in morphine tolerance and dependence largely because of the failure of morphine to promote such trafficking. However, morphine tolerance and dependence are believed to be mediated by multiple mechanisms, including well-documented biochemical changes in cAMP activity, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), and c-fos. Here, we assess the consequences of promoting morphine-induced endocytosis on these biochemical changes utilizing a knock-in mouse model, RMOR, in which MORs undergo morphine-induced endocytosis. Chronic morphine treatment of wild-type (WT) mice promoted superactivation of adenylyl cyclase, alterations in NMDARs, and up-regulation of GR and c-fos in distinct brain regions. Notably, none of these biochemical changes occurred in the RMOR-knock-in mice. Together, these data demonstrate that morphine tolerance and dependence are mediated by multiple biochemical mechanisms and that MOR endocytosis plays a critical role in each of these mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2045114035,"Our recent studies have revealed that estrogens stimulate an autocrine mechanism determining Leydig tumor cell proliferation. Estrogen overproduction is due to an elevated steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) expression and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, both inducing aromatase overexpression. Although we have shown that increased SF-1 expression depends mainly on higher local insulin-like growth factor I production, the mechanisms and factors determining increased CREB activation in Leydig tumor cells are not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in CREB dependent-aromatase expression in Leydig tumor cells. We found that COX-2 is expressed in rat and human Leydigiomas as well as in the rat Leydig tumor cell line R2C, but not in normal testis. Our data indicate that in R2C cells the COX-2-derived prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) binds the PGE2 receptor EP4 and activates protein kinase A (PKA) and ultimately CREB. Inhibitors for COX-2 (NS398), EP4 (AH23848), and PKA (H89) decreased aromatase expression and activity as a consequence of a decreased phosphorylated CREB recruitment to the PII promoter of the aromatase gene. The COX-2/PGE2/PKA pathway also seems to be involved in aromatase post-translational activation, an observation that requires further studies. The reduction in aromatase activity was responsible for a drop in estrogen production and subsequent reduction in cyclin E expression resulting in a decrease in tumor Leydig cell proliferation. Furthermore, COX-2 silencing caused a significant decrease in CREB phosphorylation, aromatase expression, and R2C cell proliferation. These novel findings clarify the mechanisms involved in the growth of Leydig cell tumors and should be taken into account in determining new therapeutic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2027821976,"Nα-Tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethylketone (TPCK) has been widely used to investigate signal transduction pathways that are involved in gene expression and cell survival/cell death. However, contradictory effects of TPCK on apoptosis have been reported, and the underlying signaling events leading to TPCK-induced promotion or prevention of apoptosis are not fully understood. Here, we show that TPCK induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed human B cell lines with release of pro-apoptotic proteins from mitochondria. TPCK treatment also results in down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins, cIAP1, cIAP2, and HAX-1, and caspase-dependent cleavage of the anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and XIAP. Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that the TPCK-induced down-regulation of HAX-1 occurred at the transcriptional level, and experiments using the specific pharmacological inhibitor, Bay 11-7082, suggested that HAX-1 expression is subject to regulation by the transcription factor, NF-κB. B cell lines derived from patients with homozygous HAX1 mutations were more sensitive to TPCK-induced apoptosis when compared with normal donor cell lines. Furthermore, N-acetylcysteine effectively blocked TPCK-induced apoptosis in EBV-transformed B cell lines and prevented the down-regulation or cleavage of anti-apoptotic proteins.

However, contradictory effects of TPCK on apoptosis have been reported. Hence, TPCK was shown to prevent apoptosis in a cell death stimulus-dependent manner in some model systems (2Jones R.A.

On the other hand, TPCK was also reported to potentiate apoptosis induced by certain apoptotic stimuli, and this was suggested to occur, at least in some cases, through activation of cell cycle checkpoints via inhibition of the proteasome (3Rokhlin O.W.

TPCK alone may also induce apoptosis. TPCK thus caused a reduction in activity of the transcription factor, NF-κB, in a murine B lymphoma cell line resulting in a decrease in c-myc and activation of apoptosis (7Wu M. Arsura M.

Subsequent studies have shown that TPCK can induce apoptosis in a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line through activation of mitochondria-dependent apoptosis signaling (4Zhu H. Dinsdale D. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Zhuang J. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Studies in transformed human T cells also indicated that TPCK can induce apoptosis through inhibition of constitutive NF-κB activation, and it was proposed that TPCK might affect sulfhydryl groups on proteins involved in regulating cell survival and NF-κB activation pathway(s) (10Heussler V.T. Fernandez P.C. Machado Jr., J. Botteron C. Dobbelaere D.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Additionally, it has been reported that TPCK may inhibit 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 signaling thus disabling central kinase cascades governing proliferation and survival (11Ballif B.A. Shimamura A. Pae E. Blenis J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More recently, studies in human colorectal carcinoma cell lines pointed to a requirement of dephosphorylation of p53 during TPCK-induced apoptosis (12Kim K. Choi K.H. Fu Y.M. Meadows G.G. Joe C.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Overall, therefore, TPCK appears to exert cell type- and stimulus-dependent effects on cell survival and cell death (apoptosis) and, moreover, these opposing effects may not necessarily be related to a direct inhibition of serine protease activity, as was originally believed to be the case. To further explore the molecular pathways of TPCK-induced apoptosis in normal (non-malignant) cells, we utilized Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed human B cell lines. Our studies show that TPCK activates caspase-dependent apoptosis in EBV-transformed B cell lines with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and release of the pro-apoptotic proteins, cytochrome c, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondria. TPCK also induced a pronounced down-regulation of cIAP1, cIAP2, and HAX-1 and concomitant caspase-dependent cleavage of Bcl-2 and XIAP. TPCK-induced modulation of HAX-1 occurred at the transcriptional level, and our data suggest that HAX-1 is a novel target gene for NF-κB. The pro-apoptotic effects of TPCK in human B cell lines were abolished in the presence of the thiol-containing anti-oxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The EBV-transformed B cell lines were established from peripheral blood lymphocytes separated from a healthy blood donor according to a standard protocol (13Neitzel H. Hum. Genet. 1986; 73: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In brief, lymphocytes were isolated by centrifugation at 800 × g on a Ficoll® gradient and incubated in EBV-containing transformation medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Cyclosporin A (1 mg/ml) was added to inactivate the T lymphocytes. Transformed cell lines were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 mm l-glutamine. The study was approved by the ethical committee at Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. EBV-transformed B cell lines were established from two patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) or Kostmann disease according to the procedures described above. The patients both harbor inherited mutations in the HAX1 gene known to be an underlying cause of autosomal recessive SCN (14Klein C. Grudzien M. Appaswamy G. Germeshausen M. Sandrock I. Schäffer A.A.

Patient 1 thus belongs to the original Kostmann family in northern Sweden and carries the “classical” homozygous HAX1 mutation identified in this kindred (568C→T, Q190X), whereas patient 2 harbors an alternative homozygous HAX1 mutation (131G→A, W44X). The patient studies were approved by the ethical committee at Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden. The human T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat from the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury, UK) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells in logarithmic growth phase were treated with TPCK (Calbiochem) at the indicated concentrations in the presence or absence of N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD-fmk, Sigma, 25 μm) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC, Sigma, 5 mm). For some experiments, cells were treated with 50 μm TPCK in the presence or absence of l-cysteine (Sigma, 3 mm) or d-cysteine (Sigma, 3 mm). Apoptosis was determined by flow cytometric quantification of phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure using annexin V-FITC staining and/or DNA content using propidium iodide (PI) staining. Briefly, for detection of PS exposure using recombinant annexin V-FITC (Calbiochem), cells were washed and resuspended in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2) containing annexin V-FITC (2 μg/ml) and PI (125 ng/ml) prior to analysis on a FACScan (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) equipped with a 488 nm argon laser. Ten thousand events were collected for each sample and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cell debris was gated out before analysis. For evaluation of hypodiploid DNA content, cells were harvested, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in staining solution containing 50 μg/ml PI, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium citrate in PBS. Cells were then analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) operating with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For detection of typical features of nuclear apoptosis, cells were harvested and resuspended in 2% paraformaldehyde. Cytospin preparations were then stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands), and cells were scored for chromatin condensation and fragmentation using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE TE2000-S, Nikon Corp., Kanagawa, Japan). Activation of caspase- 3-like enzymes was monitored using the specific fluorogenic substrate, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methyl-coumarin (DEVD-AMC). Briefly, cell lysates and fluorogenic peptide substrate (Sigma) were combined in a standard reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, 10% sucrose, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 × 10−6 Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% CHAPS), and real-time recordings of enzyme-catalyzed AMC release were obtained using a Fluoroscan II plate reader operating with Genesis software (Labsystems, Stockholm, Sweden). Fluorescence values were converted to picomoles of AMC release using a standard curve generated with free AMC and the maximum rate of AMC release (picomoles/min) was calculated. Intracellular production of ROS was measured using dihydroethidium (DHE, Molecular Probes). Oxidation of DHE by superoxide anion (O2̇̄) yields the fluorescent hydroethidium. Briefly, cells were incubated with 5 μm DHE in RPMI 1640 medium for 30 min at 37 °C. After resuspension in PBS, cells were submitted to flow cytometric analysis using a FACScan (BD Biosciences) operating with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). To evaluate the dissipation of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm), cells were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C in cell culture medium with the cationic fluorescent probe, tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE, Molecular Probes, 25 nm). Cells were then spun down, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in HEPES buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.8 mm CaCl2) containing 25 nm TMRE. As a positive control, cells were incubated for 10 min with the uncoupling agent, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (Sigma, 100 μm). Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For some experiments, monoclonal anti-Fas antibodies (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Ltd., Nagoya, Japan) were used as a positive control. To assess the potential for direct interactions between NAC and TPCK, cell-free experiments were conducted in which NAC and TPCK were mixed at the indicated concentrations and incubated at 37 °C. To determine free sulfhydryl groups in NAC, the maleimide fluorogenic sulfhydryl reagent ThioGloTM3 (Covalent Associates, Corvallis, OR) was added to each reaction at a final concentration of 1 μm. After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, the fluorescence content of each sample was determined on a multimode microplate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) using excitation and emission wavelengths 360 nm and 465 nm, respectively. Results were normalized to control (1 μm ThioGloTM3 solution). All reagents were diluted in PBS, pH 7.2, prior to use. TPCK (>97% pure) and NAC (99% pure, according to the manufacturer) were mixed together in PBS buffer at 200 and 10 μm, respectively, and placed in an incubator at 37 °C. Samples (100 μl) were taken out and infused with a syringe pump at a flow rate of 20 μl/minute into a Q-TOF Micro (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Samples were analyzed in positive ion mode with the following source settings: capillary voltage, 3500 V; cone voltage, 20 V; source temperature, 80 °C; desolvation gas flow rate, 200 L/h; and desolvation temperature, 200 °C. Mass spectra were acquired over mass-to-charge ratios of 100 to 2000. For total cell lysates, cells were lysed for 30 min at 4οC in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate). To obtain mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics Gmbh, Basel, Switzerland). Cell suspensions were then incubated with 100 μg/ml digitonin, and homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and supernatant (cytosolic fraction) as well as pellet (enriched for nuclei and mitochondria) were recovered. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford reagent (Pierce), and samples were denatured in standard Laemmli buffer. Purity of the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was determined by probing with antibodies to cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COXIV, Molecular Probes) and β-actin (Sigma), respectively. Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions or total cell extracts (20–60 μg) were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immun-BlotTM polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.2 μm, Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in 0.1% TBS-T and subsequently probed with antibodies directed against Bcl-2 (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), cytochrome oxidase subunit VIb (OxPhos complex IV subunit VIb, COXIV, Molecular Probes), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, Biomol International, Plymouth Meeting, PA), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP, Nordic Biosite, Täby, Sweden), HAX-1 (BD Biosciences), cytochrome c (BD Biosciences), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), AIF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 (cIAP2, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (DakoCytomation). Proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were reprobed with antibodies to β-actin (Sigma) to control for equal loading of protein. Total RNA from cells treated with TPCK or Bay 11-7082 (Calbiochem) was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany). Additional incubation with DNase I (Roche Applied Science) was carried out to ensure the elimination of genomic DNA from the samples. cDNA was synthesized from 400 ng of RNA using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using 20 ng of cDNA template, Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 100 nm of the appropriate forward and reverse primers. The following primers were used to amplify 126 bp of the human HAX-1 transcript: 5′-GACCTCGGAGCCACAGAGAT-3′ (forward primer sequence), 5′-GGTGCTGAGGACTATGGAAC-3′ (reverse primer sequence). The β-actin gene was used as a reference (forward primer sequence: 5′-AGCCTCGCCTTTGCCGA-3′; reverse primer sequence: 5′-GCGCGGCGATATCATCATC-3′). The amplification was carried out using an ABI PRISM 7000 (Applied Biosystems), and the cycling conditions were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 60 s (for β-actin: 40 cycles of amplification at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s). Each sample was run in triplicate from three independent experiments. To assess specificity, amplification products were subjected to melting curve analysis. Relative mRNA levels were calculated using the comparative cycle threshold method, and values were normalized against β-actin. The 5′-flanking region of the human HAX-1 genomic sequence was analyzed using the GenBankTM record containing a partial sequence of human chromosome 1 (GenBankTM accession number AL354980). Putative binding sites of the human NF-κB transcription factor family proteins, p50, p52, c-Rel, RelA/p65, and RelB, were investigated in silico using the AliBaba2 software (16Grabe N. In Silico Biol. 2002; 2: S1-15PubMed Google Scholar), which uses the TRANSFAC 4.0 transcription factor data base (17Wingender E. Dietze P. Karas H. Knüppel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The genomic sequence 5 kb upstream of the first ATG codon was analyzed. The results are expressed as mean values ± S.D. Student's t test was used to evaluate differences between samples, and differences between mean values were considered significant when p < 0.05. To investigate whether TPCK can trigger apoptosis in EBV-transformed B cells, we incubated cells with TPCK at various concentrations ranging from 10 to 75 μm. Apoptosis was determined by quantification of PS externalization and measurement of hypodiploid DNA content. In addition, activation of caspase-3-like enzymes as well as cleavage of the nuclear caspase substrate, PARP, was also determined. TPCK triggered PS exposure and caspase activation in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). Cleavage of PARP to its characteristic 85-kDa fragment was also observed in TPCK-treated cells (Fig. 1C). Next, we performed studies of the time course of TPCK-induced apoptosis. TPCK (50 μm) triggered time-dependent PS externalization, and the population of annexin V-positive/PI-negative cells displayed a maximum at 6 h of treatment, followed by increasing numbers of annexin V-positive/PI-positive cells, indicative of secondary necrosis (sometimes referred to as “late” apoptosis) (Fig. 1D). TPCK also induced a time-dependent induction of apoptosis as determined by the measurement of hypodiploid DNA content (Fig. 1E). Apoptosis induction was confirmed by the detection of typical nuclear chromatin condensation and fragmentation (data not shown). To further study whether TPCK induces caspase activation in human EBV-transformed B cells, a time course of TPCK-triggered DEVD-AMC cleavage was performed. Caspase-3-like enzyme activity was induced by TPCK (50 μm), and the activity peaked at 4 h (Fig. 2A). To confirm that specific caspase-3 activation occurred in these cells, a similar time course (1–12 h) was performed, and samples were harvested for detection of pro-caspase-3 processing using specific anti-caspase-3 antibodies. As seen in Fig. 2B, TPCK induced the processing of pro-caspase-3 (32 kDa) into its active form (17 kDa). TPCK-induced activation of caspase-3 coincided with the cleavage of PARP (Fig. 2B). Additionally, to assess whether TPCK-induced apoptosis was dependent upon caspase activation, cells were pre-treated in the presence or absence of the pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk (25 μm), and then stimulated with TPCK. TPCK-induced caspase activation was completely blocked by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2c). Moreover, TPCK-induced apoptosis, as determined by detection of hypodiploid DNA content and PS externalization, was also suppressed by the pan-caspase inhibitor (Fig. 2, d and e). Taken together, these results demonstrate that TPCK-induced apoptosis in EBV-transformed human B cells is caspase-dependent. Previous studies have shown that TPCK-induced apoptosis may occur through a mitochondria-dependent pathway (4Zhu H. Dinsdale D. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 9Zhuang J. Dinsdale D. Cohen G.M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 953-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether TPCK induces mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in EBV-transformed B cells. Reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm) was detected at 1 h and Δψm progressively decreased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Further studies showed that the effect of TPCK was also concentration-dependent (Fig. 3B). Next, we studied the release of the pro-apoptotic factors, cytochrome c and AIF, from mitochondria. As seen in Fig. 3C, TPCK triggered early release (evident from 1 h) of cytochrome c and a subsequent, time-dependent release of AIF into the cytosol. The release of cytochrome c coincided with the processing and activation of pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 3D), an event that is known to occur in a cytosolic complex termed the apoptosome, which consists of cytochrome c, pro-caspase-9, and the adaptor protein, apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (18Sun Y. Orrenius S. Pervaiz S. Fadeel B. Blood. 2005; 105: 4070-4077Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The release of mitochondrial factors and drop in membrane potential during apoptosis are associated with the production of ROS. Indeed, TPCK induced a time-dependent increase in the generation of ROS as detected by the DHE assay (Fig. 4A). The dissipation of Δψm and the production of ROS were both inhibited to some extent by z-VAD-fmk in B cells treated with TPCK (Fig. 4, B and C). However, z-VAD-fmk failed to block these mitochondrial events completely, suggesting that caspase-independent events are involved. Furthermore, TPCK-induced release of cytochrome c was unaffected in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor (see Fig. 8B). In contrast, TPCK-induced release of AIF was almost completely inhibited by z-VAD-fmk, indicating that the release of AIF occurred downstream of cytochrome c release and caspase activation.FIGURE 8Effect of NAC on TPCK-induced mitochondrial events in EBV-transformed B cells. A, B cells were pretreated or not with NAC (5 mm) for 30 min followed by TPCK (50 μm) for 12 h, and ROS production and drop of Δψm were determined using the DHE assay and TMRE staining assay, respectively. Data shown are mean values ± S.D. of at least three independent experiments. *, p < 0.001 TPCK versus TPCK plus NAC (DHE assay); #, p < 0.01 TPCK versus TPCK plus NAC (TMRE assay). B, cytosolic (supernatant) and mitochondrial (pellet) fractions were prepared from B cells treated with TPCK (50 μm) for 6 h in the presence or absence of z-VAD-fmk (25 μm) or NAC (5 mm) and subjected to Western blotting using antibodies to cytochrome c and AIF. Membranes were reprobed with antibodies to β-actin and COXIV to determine the purity of cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions, respectively. C, B cells were pretreated or not with NAC (5 mm) for 30 min followed by TPCK (50 μm) for 6 h, and total cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies against Bcl-2, XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, and HAX-1. Antibodies directed to β-actin were used to control for equal loading of protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The transcription factor, NF-κB, regulates the expression of numerous genes, including anti-apoptotic factors belonging to the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family. Furthermore, it has been suggested that TPCK induces apoptosis by inhibiting IκB phosphorylation resulting in inactivation of NF-κB (7Wu M. Arsura M. Bellas R.E. FitzGerald M.J. Lee H. Schauer S.L.

We therefore evaluated the expression of cIAP1, cIAP2, and XIAP in EBV-transformed B cells following treatment with TPCK. In addition, the expression of two mitochondria-targeted anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and HAX-1, was also investigated; both proteins have been shown to prevent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and/or release of pro-apoptotic factors from mitochondria during apoptosis (14Klein C. Grudzien M. Appaswamy G. Germeshausen M. Sandrock I. Schäffer A.A. Rathinam C. Boztug K. Schwinzer B. Rezaei N. Bohn G. Melin M. Carlsson G. Fadeel B. Dahl N. Palmblad J. Henter J.I. Zeidler C.

Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). B cells were treated with different concentrations of TPCK in the presence or absence of z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 5A) and at different time points (Fig. 5B). Bcl-2 and XIAP were both cleaved in a caspase-dependent manner in TPCK-treated cells; the cleavage of both proteins was evident at doses of 25 μm or more (Fig. 5A) and occurred in a time-dependent manner starting at 2–4 h of treatment (Fig. 5B). The processing of Bcl-2 and XIAP in TPCK-treated cells thus occurs after caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. 2, A and B), and, furthermore, this event is completely prevented by z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 5A). This is in line with previous studies in other model systems showing that the cleavage of Bcl-2 and XIAP during apoptosis is caspase-dependent (20Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B.

Fbw7 (also known as Fbxw7, Sel-10, hCdc4, or hAgo), a substrate recognition subunit of SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase, facilitates the degradation of several proto-oncogene products by the proteasome.

In the present study, we show that E1A, an oncogene product derived from adenovirus, interferes with the activity of the SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase. E1A interacted with SCFFbw7 and attenuated the ubiquitylation of its target proteins in vivo. Furthermore, using in vitro purified SCFFbw7 component proteins, we found that E1A directly bound to Roc1/Rbx1 and CUL1 and that E1A inhibited the ubiquitin ligase activity of the Roc1/Rbx1-CUL1 complex but not that of another RING-type ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2. Ectopically expressed E1A interacted with cellular endogenous Roc1/Rbx1 and CUL1 and decelerated the degradation of several protooncogene products that were degraded by SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase.

Ubiquitylation is a post-translational modification that modulates stability, localization, and function of proteins (1Hicke L. Schubert H.L. Hill C.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 610-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Ubiquitin forms a polyubiquitin chain via an isopeptide linkage to a lysine of the target protein, which then efficiently targets the proteins for degradation via the 26S proteasome. The abundance of several proteins is regulated by the ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway (2Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Protein ubiquitylation is catalyzed by a cascade reaction involving three enzymes, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), 3The abbreviations used are: E1ubiquitin-activating enzymeE2ubiquitin-conjugating enzymeE3ubiquitin ligaseaaamino acidsCBPcAMP-response element-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseCHXcycloheximideAPC/Canaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3).

The SCF complex is a multisubunit RING finger type ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the ubiquitylation of various proteins involved in cell cycle control and signal transduction. The SCF complex consists of three invariable components, Roc1/Rbx1 (RING finger protein), Skp1 (adapter protein), and CUL1 (scaffold protein), as well as one variable F-box protein that serves as a receptor for the target proteins (5Cardozo T.

The proteins encoded by E1A (early region 1A) of human adenovirus type 5 play an important role in viral replication (24Jones N. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 3665-3669Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). E1A promotes DNA synthesis and immortalization of primary rodent cells, and it cooperates in cell transformation with other oncogene products, including E1B encoded by E1B (early region 1B) of human adenovirus (25Chinnadurai G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 273: 139-161PubMed Google Scholar). The E1A gene generates two major species of mRNA, 13S and 12S, that encode proteins of 289 and 243 aa, respectively. Although they differ in that the larger protein contains an extra internal 46-aa sequence, both isoforms do possess potent cell transforming activities. E1A protein interacts with various cellular proteins, including the pRb family proteins and p300/CBP, and perturbs cell proliferation and differentiation (26Whyte P. Williamson N.M. Harlow E. Cell. 1989; 56: 67-75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 27Gallimore P.H. Turnell A.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7824-7835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pRb controls G1/S progression by interacting with E2F family transcription factors. Interaction of E1A with pRb stimulates E2F-dependent transcription of several growth-promoting genes (28Whyte P. Buchkovich K.J. Horowitz J.M. Friend S.H. Raybuck M. Weinberg R.A. Harlow E. Nature. 1988; 334: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Therefore, E1A promotes an unregulated S-phase entry and perturbs the cell cycle. p300 and CBP are transcriptional coactivators, which are recruited to various promoters by interacting with diverse transcription factors. E1A modulates p300/CBP-mediated transcriptional activation and chromatin remodeling through direct interaction (29Brockmann D. Esche H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 272: 97-129PubMed Google Scholar). However, additional uncharacterized cellular polypeptides are found in E1A immunoprecipitates of adenovirus-transformed or adenovirus-infected cells (30Egan C. Yee S.P. Ferguson B. Rosenberg M. Branton P.E. Virology. 1987; 160: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which E1A exerts its biological activity is not fully understood. In the present study, we found that E1A interacts with SCFFbw7 in mammalian cells. Given that E1A and Fbw7 possess opposite functions in cell cycle regulation, we investigated whether E1A and Fbw7 interfere with each other. Although Fbw7 did not affect the stability of the E1A protein, ubiquitylation of the target proteins of SCFFbw7 was attenuated by coexpression with E1A. Using in vitro purified components, we found that E1A directly targeted Roc1/Rbx1 and CUL1. Indeed, we observed that the ubiquitin ligase activity of the Roc1/Rbx1-CUL1 complex was disturbed by E1A in vitro. Furthermore, we observed a decelerated turnover of SCFFbw7 target proteins. These results suggest that E1A can interfere with the turnover of proteins whose stability is regulated by SCFFbw7 ubiquitin ligase through the inhibition of the SCFFbw7 complex. Given that loss of function of Fbw7 promotes unregulated cell growth (18Mao J.H. Perez-Losada J. Wu D. Delrosario R. Tsunematsu R. Nakayama K.I. Brown K. Bryson S. Balmain A.

To generate expression plasmids for E1A ΔN39 and ΔC104, the cDNA regions corresponding to the N-terminal 40 amino acids or C-terminal 104 amino acids were removed from pcDNA4–12S E1A by PCR-based deletion. pcDNA4-E1A ΔCR1, Δ80–119, and ΔCR2 were generated by ligation of two segments within the 12S E1A cDNA encoding amino acids 1–39 and 85–243, 1–79 and 120–243, and 1–118 and 147–243, respectively, which were each amplified by PCR. For the retroviral vectors, cDNA for 12S E1A or E1AΔN39 were recloned into the pBabe-puro plasmid. To generate bacterial expression plasmids for glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused E1A, E1AΔN39, T7-Roc1/Rbx1, Myc-CUL1, HA-Skp1, and FLAG-Fbw7, each portion of cDNA was recloned into pGEX6P (GE Healthcare). For Strep·Tag-fused E1A, E1A cDNA was recloned into pET52 (Novagen). pGEX-4T3/pET-15b-(GST-HA-Roc1/Rbx1)-(His-FLAG-CUL1-(324–776)) was kindly provided by Dr. Z. Q. Pan (38Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J.

For immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting of His6-Xpress-tagged proteins, an Omni probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-Xpress antibody (Invitrogen) was used. Full-length c-Myc was immunoprecipitated using a polyclonal antibody (N-262; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected using a monoclonal antibody (C-33; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies against the HA epitope (3F10; Roche Applied Science), FLAG epitope (M2; Sigma), Myc epitope (9E10 (Roche Applied Science) and 9B11 (Cell Signaling)), GST (B-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), E1A (M73; Santa Cruz), c-Myb (1-1; Upstate), α-tubulin (DM1A; Sigma), ubiquitin (Dako), Mdm2 (SMP-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cyclin D1 (MBL International), p27 (57; BD Bioscience), and IκBα (C21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were commercially purchased. Anti-Roc1/Rbx1 antiserum (36Ohta T. Michel J.J. Schottelius A.J. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 535-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. T. Ohta. HA peptide (Sigma), MG132 (Peptide Institute) and cycloheximide (Wako) were commercially purchased. All cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HEK293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method, whereas HeLa cells and U2OS cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Adenovirus type 5 was propagated in HEK293 cells. The infectious units for each cell type were determined by immunofluorescence with the anti-E1A antibody. HeLa and U2OS cells were infected at 5 infectious units/cell. Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and protease inhibitor mix). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were done as described previously with some modifications (32Isobe T. Uchida C. Hattori T. Kitagawa K. Oda T. Kitagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 39Uchida C. Miwa S. Kitagawa K. Hattori T. Isobe T. Otani S. Oda T. Sugimura H. Kamijo T. Ookawa K. Yasuda H. Kitagawa M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For in vivo ubiquitylation assays, cell lysates were denatured by treatment with 2% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C to dissociate non-covalent protein associations prior to immunoprecipitation. For retrovirus production, pBabe-puro-based individual expression plasmids were co-transfected with gag, pol, and VSV-G envelope expressing helper plasmids into HEK293T cells using the FuGENE 6 reagent. At 18 h after transfection, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum and incubated for an additional 24 h. Viral supernatant was collected and filtered using a 0.45-μm syringe filter, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml Polybrene. Cells were infected with 8 ml of the viral supernatant for 24 h. Infection was repeated once to increase infection efficiency. After infection, cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin for 48 h. GST and GST-fused Roc1/Rbx1, CUL1, Skp1, and Fbw7 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). The proteins, with the exception of GST-fused E1A, were eluted with 50 mm glutathione and then dialyzed to remove the glutathione. In the case of GST-fused E1A, GST was removed by cleavage with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare), and the released E1A was collected. Strep·Tag-fused E1A protein was expressed as described above and purified using a Strep·Tactin Super Flow column (Novagen). A GST pull-down assay was performed as follows. A total of 10 pmol of Strep·Tag-fused E1A was incubated with equal amounts (mol/mol) of GST or GST-fused proteins for 1 h at 4 °C, and GST-fused proteins were precipitated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting. GST-HA-tagged Roc1/Rbx1 and the His6-FLAG-tagged CUL1 C terminus region (corresponding to aa 324–776) were simultaneously expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and co-purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B, as described in a previous report (38Wu K. Chen A. Pan Z.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32317-32324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The resultant Roc1/Rbx1-CUL1 complex was incubated with 50 ng of E1 (Boston Biochem), 300 ng of UbcH5c (Boston Biochem), and 1 μg of ubiquitin (Sigma) in a ubiquitylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 2 mm ATP, and 0.6 mm dithiothreitol) together with or without recombinant E1A for 60 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated and denatured in Laemmli's sample buffer at 100 °C and analyzed by immunoblotting. We previously reported that adenovirus E1A gene products were polyubiquitylated and degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner in mammalian cells (32Isobe T. Uchida C. Hattori T. Kitagawa K. Oda T. Kitagawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 339: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the ubiquitin ligase that targets E1A for ubiquitin-dependent degradation has not been identified. We noticed that there was a possible Cdc4 phosphodegron sequence (11Kitagawa K. Hiramatsu Y. Uchida C. Isobe T. Hattori T. Oda T. Shibata K. Nakamura S. Kikuchi A. Kitagawa M. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2393-2405Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 19Welcker M. Clurman B.E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) within the 13S E1A gene product but not within the 12S product (aa residues 183–191 of 13S E1A). Fbw7/Cdc4 recognizes the Cdc4 phosphodegron and binds to the substrates via a WD40 repeat domain. Thus, we first hypothesized that Fbw7 mediates the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of 13S E1A protein as a ubiquitin ligase. To address this hypothesis, we investigated whether Fbw7 interacts with E1A in mammalian cells. The expression plasmid for HA-Fbw7 was cotransfected into HEK293 cells together with the plasmid for 4×FLAG-13S or -12S E1A. When FLAG-tagged 13S E1A was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, Fbw7 was coprecipitated. However, unexpectedly, Fbw7 was also coprecipitated with 12S E1A (Fig. 1). Next, to analyze the effect of Fbw7 on 13S E1A protein stability, we chased protein levels of E1A by immunoblotting after inhibiting de novo protein synthesis in the cells with cycloheximide (CHX chase assay). The result indicated that coexpression of Fbw7 has no apparent effect on the degradation of 13S E1A (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, Fbw7 physically interacts with E1A without affecting the turnover of E1A. Although E1A usually affects the level of protein expression by its action at the transcriptional level through the interaction with pRb and p300/CBP (21Liu J. Furukawa M. Matsumoto T. Xiong Y. Mol.

Science. 2008; 321: 1086-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), it has been shown that E1A alters certain protein expression levels by affecting regulation mechanisms of the protein stability (42Nakajima T.

Thus, we supposed that the ubiquitylation activity of the SCFFbw7 complex is affected by E1A. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effect of E1A on c-Myb ubiquitylation, which is mediated by the SCFFbw7 complex and then followed by proteasomal degradation (11Kitagawa K. Hiramatsu Y.

Myc epitope-tagged c-Myb (c-Myb-Myc), FLAG-ubiquitin, and HA-Fbw7 expression plasmids were cotransfected into HEK293 cells with or without a His6-Xpress-tagged E1A (hereafter referred to as Xpress-E1A) expression plasmid. To dissociate proteins noncovalently associated with c-Myb, cell lysates were incubated under denaturing conditions, and subsequently c-Myb-Myc was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody to evaluate the ubiquitylation levels of c-Myb (Fig. 2A, Denature, IP: αMyc). Consistent with previous studies, coexpression of Fbw7 enhanced c-Myb ubiquitylation (lanes 3 and 4). Importantly, when E1A was coexpressed, c-Myb ubiquitylation was markedly diminished (lane 5). Furthermore, in vivo ubiquitylation assays for cyclin E (Fig. 2B) and c-Myc (Fig. 2C), which are well characterized targets of SCFFbw7 (8Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W.

Similar to the ubiquitylation of c-Myb, ubiquitylation of cyclin E (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4) and c-Myc (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4) were facilitated by Fbw7, and E1A attenuated Fbw7-induced ubiquitylation of both proteins (Fig. 2, B, lanes 5 and 6, and C, lane 5). We also confirmed that the ubiquitylation level of c-Myb protein was attenuated by coexpression of E1A in U2OS cells, which do not express any viral oncoproteins (supplemental Fig. S2). Substrate specificity of SCF ubiquitin ligase is altered by the substrate recognition subunit F-box protein. To verify whether E1A specifically affects SCFFbw7, we assessed the effect of E1A on IκBα ubiquitylation, which is mediated by the SCFFbw1/βTrCP complex (34Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoé K. Good R.A. Nakayama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Although the ubiquitylation of IκBα is facilitated by Fbw1 (Fig. 2D, lanes 3 and 4), E1A did not affect it (Fig. 2D, lane 5). Taken together, these results suggested that E1A specifically inhibited the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of SCFFbw7. Fbw7 recognizes phosphorylated substrates via a WD40 repeat domain and binds to Skp1 through the F-box to recruit the remainder of an SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (45Kipreos E.T. Pagano M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 3002.1-3002.7Crossref Google Scholar). To determine whether these domains are required for the interaction between Fbw7 and E1A, expression plasmids for the WD40 repeat deletion (ΔWD) or the F-box deletion (ΔF) mutant Fbw7 (Fig. 3A) were transfected into HEK293 cells, and a coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed. Because HEK293 cells harbor 11% of the adenovirus 5 DNA sequence in a chromosome-integrated fashion, they persistently express E1A and E1B gene products (46Louis N. Evelegh C. Graham F.L. Virology. 1997; 233: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). When the HEK293 genome-derived E1A was immunoprecipitated with anti-E1A antibody, wild-type and ΔWD Fbw7 but not ΔF were coprecipitated with E1A (Fig. 3B). Because Fbw7 interacts with E1A in an F-box-dependent manner, it is likely that E1A directly targets the F-box and competes with Skp1 for binding to Fbw7. However, interaction between Fbw7 and CUL1 were still observed when E1A was overexpressed in HEK293 cells (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that E1A does not disrupt the association of Fbw7 with Skp1. To determine the direct target of E1A, Strep·Tag-fused E1A and GST-fused Roc1/Rbx1, Skp1, CUL1, and Fbw7 were expressed in E. coli and purified independently. Binding of E1A to each GST-fused protein was examined using the GST pull-down assay. As shown in Fig. 3C, Roc1/Rbx1 and CUL1 still coprecipitated with E1A in a purified cell-free system, whereas Skp1 and Fbw7 as well as the control GST did not. In addition, Roc1/Rbx1 and CUL1 exogenously expressed in HEK293 cells were coprecipitated with E1A (data not shown). Thus, we concluded that Roc1/Rbx1 and CUL1 are direct targets of E1A and that E1A indirectly interacts with Fbw7 via the Roc1/Rbx1-CUL1 complex. To confirm the interaction of E1A with endogenous Roc1/Rbx1 and CUL1 in mammalian cells, cell lysate prepared from HEK293 cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation using an antibody against E1A or control immunoglobulin, followed by immunoblotting with antibodies against CUL1 and Roc1/Rbx1. Both CUL1 and Roc1/Rbx1 were coprecipitated with E1A in the case of precipitation with anti-E1A but not with the control (Fig. 3D), indicating that 293 genome-derived E1A interacts with endogenous CUL1 and Roc1/Rbx1. It was indicated that CUL1 was detected as double bands by immunoblotting and that the slower migrated band corresponded to the neddy"
https://openalex.org/W1980760492,"The Inositol 1,4,5- trisphosphate receptor (InsP(3)R) is an intracellular ligand gated channel that releases calcium from intracellular stores in response to extracellular signals. To identify and understand physiological processes and behavior that depends on the InsP(3) signaling pathway at a systemic level, we are studying Drosophila mutants for the InsP(3)R (itpr) gene. Here, we show that growth defects precede larval lethality and both are a consequence of the inability to feed normally. Moreover, restoring InsP(3)R function in insulin producing cells (IPCs) in the larval brain rescues the feeding deficit, growth and lethality in the itpr mutants to a significant extent. We have previously demonstrated a critical requirement for InsP(3)R activity in neuronal cells, specifically in aminergic interneurons, for larval viability. Processes from the IPCs and aminergic domain are closely apposed in the third instar larval brain with no visible cellular overlap. Ubiquitous depletion of itpr by dsRNA results in feeding deficits leading to larval lethality similar to the itpr mutant phenotype. However, when itpr is depleted specifically in IPCs or aminergic neurons, the larvae are viable. These data support a model where InsP(3)R activity in non-overlapping neuronal domains independently rescues larval itpr phenotypes by non-cell autonomous mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1985416109,"Action potentials are thought to be determinant for the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity, the cellular basis of learning and memory. However, neuronal activity does not lead systematically to an action potential but also, in many cases, to synaptic depolarizing subthreshold events. This is particularly exemplified in corticostriatal information processing. Indeed, the striatum integrates information from the whole cerebral cortex and, due to the membrane properties of striatal medium spiny neurons, cortical inputs do not systematically trigger an action potential but a wide range of subthreshold postsynaptic depolarizations. Accordingly, we have addressed the following question: does a brief subthreshold event act as a Hebbian signal and induce long-term synaptic efficacy changes?Here, using perforated patch-clamp recordings on rat brain corticostriatal slices, we demonstrate, that brief (30 ms) subthreshold depolarizing events in quasi-coincidence with presynaptic activity can act as Hebbian signals and are sufficient to induce long-term synaptic plasticity at corticostriatal synapses. This ""subthreshold-depolarization dependent plasticity"" (SDDP) induces strong, significant and bidirectional long-term synaptic efficacy changes at a very high occurrence (81%) for time intervals between pre- and postsynaptic stimulations (Deltat) of -110<Deltat<+110 ms. Such subthreshold depolarizations are able to induce robust long-term depression (cannabinoid type-1 receptor-activation dependent) as well as long-term potentiation (NMDA receptor-activation dependent).Our data show the existence of a robust, reliable and timing-dependent bidirectional long-term plasticity induced by brief subthreshold events paired with presynaptic activity. The existence of a subthreshold-depolarization dependent plasticity extends considerably, beyond the action potential, the neuron's capabilities to express long-term synaptic efficacy changes."
https://openalex.org/W1987358333,"Selection of mammalian high-producer cell lines remains a major challenge for the biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes encode the major component of the ribosome but many rRNA gene copies are not transcribed due to epigenetic silencing by the nucleolar remodelling complex (NoRC) [6], which may limit the cell's full production capacity. Here we show that the knockdown of TIP5, a subunit of NoRC, decreases the number of silent rRNA genes, upregulates rRNA transcription, enhances ribosome synthesis and increases production of recombinant proteins. However, general enhancement of rRNA transcription rate did not stimulate protein synthesis. Our data demonstrates that the number of transcriptionally competent rRNA genes limits efficient ribosome synthesis. Epigenetic engineering of ribosomal RNA genes offers new possibilities for improving biopharmaceutical manufacturing and provides novel insights into the complex regulatory network which governs the translation machinery in normal cellular processes as well as in pathological conditions like cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1987901136,"RNA polymerase II (RNA pol II) is a multisubunit enzyme that requires many auxiliary factors for its activity. Over the years, these factors have been identified using both biochemical and genetic approaches. Recently, the systematic characterization of protein complexes by tandem affinity purification and mass spectroscopy has allowed the identification of new components of well established complexes, including the RNA pol II holoenzyme. Using this approach, a novel and highly conserved factor, Iwr1p, that physically interacts with most of the RNA pol II subunits has been described in yeast. Here we show that Iwr1p genetically interacts with components of the basal transcription machinery and plays a role in both basal and regulated transcription. We report that mutation of the IWR1 gene is able to bypass the otherwise essential requirement for the transcriptional regulator negative cofactor 2, which occurs with different components of the basal transcription machinery, including TFIIA and subunits of the mediator complex. Deletion of the IWR1 gene leads to an altered expression of specific genes, including phosphate-responsive genes and SUC2. Our results show that Iwr1p is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttling protein and suggest that Iwr1p acts early in the formation of the pre-initiation complex by mediating the interaction of certain activators with the basal transcription apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2084074188,"Deregulation of hypothalamic fatty acid sensing lead to hepatic insulin-resistance which may partly contribute to further impairment of glucose homeostasis.We investigated here whether hypothalamic nitric oxide (NO) could mediate deleterious peripheral effect of central lipid overload. Thus we infused rats for 24 hours into carotid artery towards brain, either with heparinized triglyceride emulsion (Intralipid, IL) or heparinized saline (control rats).Lipids infusion led to hepatic insulin-resistance partly related to a decreased parasympathetic activity in the liver assessed by an increased acetylcholinesterase activity. Hypothalamic nitric oxide synthases (NOS) activities were significantly increased in IL rats, as the catalytically active neuronal NOS (nNOS) dimers compared to controls. This was related to a decrease in expression of protein inhibitor of nNOS (PIN). Effect of IL infusion on deregulated hepatic insulin-sensitivity was reversed by carotid injection of non selective NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) and also by a selective inhibitor of the nNOS isoform, 7-Nitro-Indazole (7-Ni). In addition, NO donor injection (L-arginine and SNP) within carotid in control rats mimicked lipid effects onto impaired hepatic insulin sensitivity. In parallel we showed that cultured VMH neurons produce NO in response to fatty acid (oleic acid).We conclude that cerebral fatty acid overload induces an enhancement of nNOS activity within hypothalamus which is, at least in part, responsible fatty acid increased hepatic glucose production."
