https://openalex.org/W2000630098,Plankton autotrophs vary greatly in size and shape. Computation of surface/volume ratios for biomass units of 27 coexisting phytoplankton species in a tropical lake indicates that these ratios are conserved within a range much narrower than expected by random choice of shapes. Conservation of surface/volume ratios suggests new explanations for the shapes of phytoplankton biomass units.

https://openalex.org/W2067856361,"Many species of ants engage in physical fighting when territorial borders are challenged. In contrast, colonies of the honeypot ant species Myrmecocystus mimicus conduct ritualized tournaments, in which hundreds of ants perform highly stereotyped display fights. Opposing colonies summon their worker forces to the tournament area by means of an alarm-recruitment system. When one colony is considerably stronger than the other, the tournament quickly ends, and the weaker colony is raided and its ants ""enslaved."" This is the first example of intraspecific slavery recorded in ants."

https://openalex.org/W2007232960,"A map of the preservation pattern of siliceous microfossils was constructed from an examination of 125 piston and gravity cores of Quaternary sediments from throughout the eastern tropical Pacific. Preservation is enhanced where high surface water productivity supplies a high input rate of siliceous tests to the sea floor, except in a large area north of 5Â°N, east of the East Pacific Rise. Here a high input rate of terrigenous silicates may adversely affect preservation of biogenic opal in the sea-floor sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2046306723,"The discovery of an existing member of the Glypheidae, a family believed to have been extinct since the Eocene, may yield significant information on the evolution and classification of the decapod Crustacea. The single known specimen displays characters not apparent in fossil material, some of them perhaps representative of an ancestral decapod lineage, others reminiscent of the Astacidea and Thalassinidea."
