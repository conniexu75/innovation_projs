https://openalex.org/W2050746675,"Glutamate binds to both excitatory neurotransmitter binding sites and a Cl(-)-dependent, quisqualate- and cystine-inhibited transport site on brain neurons. The neuroblastoma-primary retina hybrid cells (N18-RE-105) are susceptible to glutamate-induced cytotoxicity. The Cl(-)-dependent transport site to which glutamate and quisqualate (but not kainate or NMDA) bind has a higher affinity for cystine than for glutamate. Lowering cystine concentrations in the cell culture medium results in cytotoxicity similar to that induced by glutamate addition in its morphology, kinetics, and Ca2+ dependence. Glutamate-induced cytotoxicity is directly proportional to its ability to inhibit cystine uptake. Exposure to glutamate (or lowered cystine) causes a decrease in glutathione levels and an accumulation of intracellular peroxides. Like N18-RE-105 cells, primary rat hippocampal neurons (but not glia) in culture degenerate in medium with lowered cystine concentration. Thus, glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in N18-RE-105 cells is due to inhibition of cystine uptake, resulting in lowered glutathione levels leading to oxidative stress and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1966254031,"It is generally accepted that unrearranged immunoglobulin VH gene segments are not expressed and that assembly of a complete heavy chain gene is required to activate a previously silent VH promoter. We report that unrearranged VH gene segments are indeed expressed at a high level, but only in a developmentally controlled and tissue-specific manner. Unrearranged VH expression is limited to the very early stages of the B-lymphocyte differentiation pathway, and it is most prominent in cells undergoing VH to DJH rearrangement. Germ-line VH expression is independent of the heavy chain enhancer, may be controlled by 5' sequence elements, and is repressible by LPS. In contrast to earlier interpretations, our results demonstrate that the lack of unrearranged VH segment expression in mature, Ig-secreting cells is due to the inactivation of a previously active locus. These findings may provide insight into the mechanisms that control ordered rearrangement and allelic exclusion."

https://openalex.org/W2075227844,"Cyclins were discovered in marine invertebrates based on their dramatic cell cycle periodicity. Recently, the products of three genes associated with cell cycle progression in S. cerevisiae were found to share limited homology with cyclins. Mutational elimination of the CLN1, CLN2, and DAF1/WHI1 products leads to cell cycle arrest independent of cell type, while expression of any one of the genes allows cell proliferation. Using strains where CLN1 was expressed conditionally, the essential function of Cln proteins was found to be limited to the G1 phase. Furthermore, the ability of the Cln proteins to carry out this function was found to decay rapidly upon cessation of Cln biosynthesis. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that Cln proteins activate the Cdc28 protein kinase, shown to be essential for the G1 to S phase transition in S. cerevisiae. Because of the apparent functional redundancy of these genes, DAF1/WHI1 has been renamed CLN3."
https://openalex.org/W2041542789,"Tumor suppressor genes are wild-type alleles of genes that play regulatory roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and other cellular and systemic processes. It is their loss or inactivation that is oncogenic. The first evidence of tumor suppressor genes appeared in the early 1970s, but only within the past few years has a wealth of new information illuminated the central importance of these genes. Two or more different suppressor genes may be inactivated in the same tumors, and the same suppressors may be inactive in different tumor types (for example, lung, breast, and colon). The suppressor genes already identified are involved in cell cycle control, signal transduction, angiogenesis, and development, indicating that they contribute to a broad array of normal and tumor-related functions. It is proposed that tumor suppressor genes provide a vast untapped resource for anticancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1988019232,"THE lymphocyte function-associated molecule LFA-1 (CD 11 a/ CD 18) plays a key part in lymphocyte adhesion1,2. Lymphocytes do not adhere spontaneously; activation of protein kinase C (PKC)3 by phorbol esters, however, gives rise to strong LFA-1-dependent adhesion4, indicating that activation of LFA-1 is required to induce cell adhesion. We have now investigated whether the functionally important CD2 and CD3 surface structures on T lymphocytes5–8 are involved in the activation of LFA-1. The stimulation of these molecules, which causes activation of PKC9,10, strongly promoted LFA-1-dependent adhesion. Furthermore, we demonstrate by using cells from an LFA-1-deficient patient that this enhanced lymphocyte adhesion is caused by activation of the LFA-1 molecule and not by activation of its ligands. LFA-1 was persistently activated by triggering through CD2 but only transiently by triggering through CD3. We postulate that CD2 and CD3 can differentially regulate the affinity of LFA-1 for its ligands by modulating its molecular conformation through PKC-dependent mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2063261415,"Responses of excitatory amino acid receptors to rapidly applied glutamate were measured in outside-out membrane patches from chick spinal neurons. The peak current varied with glutamate concentration, with a half-maximal response at 510 μM and a Hill coefficient near 2. Currents activated by 1 mM glutamate desensitized and recovered in two phases. The faster time constant was identical to the time constant of decay of synaptic currents, suggesting that glutamatergic synaptic currents are terminated, in part, by receptor desensitization. Steady-state desensitization was evident following application of only 2–3 μM glutamate, concentrations comparable to levels in the extracellular space in the intact brain. Thus, glutamate receptor desensitization can affect synaptic efficacy in two ways: at high concentrations, rapid desensitization of receptors may curtail synaptic currents; at low concentrations, there is a significant reduction in the number of activatable receptors."

https://openalex.org/W1988323645,"The whole-cell variant of the patch clamp technique was used to study calcium channels in GH3 cells. Two distinct populations of calcium channels, first recognized from their closing kinetics, were observed. The slowly closing channels are activated in a relatively negative voltage range and are inactivated within 100 milliseconds. They conduct barium and calcium about equally well. The fast closing channels are activated at more positive voltages, are not inactivated during a 100-millisecond pulse, conduct barium in preference to calcium, and are activated slightly more rapidly than the slowly closing channels."
https://openalex.org/W1977166139,"We analyzed the mechanism by which snRNAs are accumulated in the cell nucleus by introducing in vitro mutations into a cloned Xenopus U2 snRNA gene. The mutant genes were then expressed by microinjection into living oocytes. Using autoimmune antisera we localized the binding sites of snRNP proteins on the mutant U2 snRNAs. Sm antigen, a component shared by most U snRNPs, requires for binding a sequence containing AUUUUUG, a feature partly conserved in U1, U2, U4, and U5 snRNAs. A U2-specific protein defined by a second antiserum requires the two 3' loops of the U2 RNA molecule for binding. Mutant U2 transcripts unable to bind Sm antigen do not accumulate in the nucleus. Since Sm antigenic proteins are cytoplasmic and excluded from the oocyte nucleus when not bound to snRNA, we propose that a karyophilic domain may become exposed on formation of the RNA-protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W1964502521,"At early developmental stages (embryonic day 7, E7), chick paravertebral sympathetic ganglia contain a cell population that divides in culture while expressing various neuronal properties. In an attempt to identify factors that control neuronal proliferation, we found that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) specifically inhibits the proliferation of those cells expressing neuronal markers. In addition, CNTF affects the differentiation of sympathetic ganglion cells by inducing the expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide immunoreactivity (VIP-IR). After 1 day in culture, tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-IR) was expressed by about 86% of the cells whereas VIP-IR was virtually absent. In the presence of CNTF, 50%-60% of the cells expressed VIP-IR after 4 days in culture; however, none of the cells expressed VIP-IR in the absence of CNTF. These results, and the demonstration of cells that express both VIP and TH-IR, indicate that VIP is induced in cells that initially express tyrosine hydroxylase. The findings suggest a potential role for CNTF as a factor affecting the proliferation and differentiation of developing sympathetic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2088875438,"We tested the effect of two NMDA receptor antagonists, APV or MK801 (with NMDA), and the receptor agonist NMDA on the maintenance of retinal topography in frogs. Topography was assayed by measuring the dispersion of retrogradely labeled ganglion cells following a local HRP injection into the tectum. In untreated tadpoles, labeled cells covered about 5% of the retinal area. In APV- or MK801/NMDA-treated tadpoles, labeled ganglion cells covered 17% and 10% of the retinal area, respectively. Neither treatment with L-APV nor with NMDA disrupts the fidelity of the retinotectal projection. Neither APV- nor NMDA-treated ganglion cell terminals differed from untreated terminals with respect to tangential area, branch number, or branch density. These data support a role for the NDMA receptor in visual system development."
https://openalex.org/W1977451474,"L-Glutamate is regarded as the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian CNS. However, whether the released transmitter originates from a cytosolic pool or is discharged from synaptic vesicles by exocytosis (vesicle hypothesis) remains controversial. A problem with the general acceptance of the vesicle hypothesis is that the enrichment of glutamate in synaptic vesicles has not been convincingly demonstrated. In the present study, we have analyzed the glutamate content of synaptic vesicles isolated from rat cerebral cortex by a novel immunobead procedure. A large amount of glutamate was present in these vesicles when a proton electrochemical gradient was maintained across the vesicle membrane during isolation. Compared with the starting fraction, glutamate was enriched more than 10-fold relative to other amino acids. Addition of N-ethylmaleimide prevented glutamate loss during isolation. Isotope exchange experiments revealed that exchange or re-uptake of glutamate after homogenization is negligible. We conclude that rat brain synaptic vesicles contain high levels of glutamate in situ."

https://openalex.org/W1969099021,"Adult cholinergic interneurons of the neostriatum are not immunoreactive for monoclonal antibody to NGF receptor, whereas the developing neostriatum is immunoreactive for this same antibody. Chronic NGF infusion into the adult neostriatum resulted in reexpression of the NGF receptor such that many cholinergic interneurons became immunoreactive for NGF receptor. NGF infusion dramatically increased the size and choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity of these same cholinergic neurons. Additionally, in situ hybridization demonstrated an increase in the number of cells expressing NGF receptor mRNA in the NGF-infused striatum. These findings indicate that central cholinergic neurons which lose their NGF receptors during postnatal development will resume their NGF responsiveness when the tissue is damaged. Such a damage-induced mechanism may act to enhance the action of trophic factors, including NGF, released at the site of injury and enhance the responsiveness of damaged CNS neurons to exogenously administered trophic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2126069984,"Torsion dystonia is a movement disorder of unknown etiology characterized by loss of control of voluntary movements appearing as sustained muscle contractions and/or abnormal postures. Dystonic movements can be caused by lesions in the basal ganglia, drugs, or gene defects. Several hereditary forms have been described, most of which have autosomal dominant transmission with variable expressivity. In the Ashkenazi Jewish population the defective gene frequency is about 1/10,000. Here, linkage analysis using polymorphic DNA and protein markers has been used to locate a gene responsible for susceptibility to dystonia in a large, non-Jewish kinship. Affected members of this family have a clinical syndrome similar to that found in the Jewish population. This dystonia gene (ITD1) shows tight linkage with the gene encoding gelsolin, an actin binding protein, and appears by multipoint linkage analysis to lie in the q32-q34 region of chromosome 9 between ABO and D9S26, a region that also contains the locus for dopamine-beta-hydroxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1982839428,Murine monoclonal antibodies to Streptococcus pyogenes reacted with skeletal muscle myosin. High molecular weight proteins in extracts of human heart tissue that reacted with an antibody to S. pyogenes also reacted with a monoclonal antibody to ventricular myosin. Adsorption of the antibody to streptococci with S. pyogenes simultaneously removed reactivity of the antibody for either S. pyogenes or myosin. These results indicate that myosin shares immunodeterminants with a component of S. pyogenes.

https://openalex.org/W1528048556,"The pharmacologic agents verapamil, nifedipine, diltiazem, prenylamine, N-oleoylethanolamine, R 24571, trifluoperazine, dibucaine, and quinacrine are examined as potential inhibitors of rat liver mitochondrial phospholipase A2 acting on endogenous phospholipid. Their potency as inhibitors of the enzyme is compared to their activities as inhibitors of phospholipase A2-dependent swelling and ruthenium red-induced Ca2+ release in intact mitochondria. For verapamil, diltiazem, trifluoperazine, dibucaine, and quinacrine, there is complete agreement between the relative potencies as inhibitors of phospholipase A2 and the two other processes. Nifedipine and prenylamine, which are weak inhibitors of phospholipase A2, produce a permeable inner membrane, provided that the mitochondrial have accumulated Ca2+. R 24571, which strongly inhibits the enzyme, disrupts mitochondria by a Ca2+-independent mechanism. N-Oleoylethanolamine, which is an effective inhibitor of swelling, does not inhibit phospholipase A2 or ruthenium red-induced Ca2+ release. The results support a proposed scheme wherein ruthenium red-induced Ca2+ release is viewed as reverse activity of the Ca2+-uptake uniporter occurring subsequent to decline in the proton motive force. The latter effect is proposed to arise from a specific phospholipase A2-dependent increase in inner-membrane H+ conductance of mitochondrial subpopulations. It is further shown that mitochondrial membranes display cyclic oscillations in free fatty acid content which are not dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or on the capacity to generate acylcoenzyme A."
https://openalex.org/W2090519382,"Previous studies described three different classes of glial cells in the developing CNS of the early Drosophila embryo that prefigure and ensheath the major CNS axon tracts. Among these are 6 longitudinal glial cells on each side of each segment that overlie the longitudinal axon tracts. Here we use transformant lines carrying a P element containing a 130 bp sequence from the fushi tarazu gene in front of the lacZ reporter gene to direct beta-galactosidase expression in the longitudinal glia. Using this molecular lineage marker, we show that 1 of the ""neuroblasts"" in each hemisegment is actually a glioblast, which divides once symmetrically, in contrast to the typical asymmetric neuroblast divisions, producing 2 glial cells, which migrate medially and divide to generate the 6 longitudinal glial cells. As with neuroblasts, mutations in Notch and other neurogenic genes lead to supernumerary glioblasts. The results indicate that the glioblast is similar to other neuroblasts; however, the positionally specified fate of this blast cell is to generate a specific lineage of glia rather than a specific family of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1988424328,"Pure traumatic neuronal injury was modeled in dispersed neocortical cell cultures derived from fetal mice. A plastic stylet was used to tear the neuronal and glial cell layer; medium oxygen content, pH, and glucose remained unchanged. Adjacent to this local disruption, many neurons developed acute swelling and went on to degenerate over the next day, but glia were relatively spared. If the same mechanical insult was delivered in the presence of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists dextrorphan or d-2-amino-5-phosphonoval-erate, resultant neuronal degeneration was markedly reduced. The protective effect of these NMDA antagonists was concentration-dependent between 1 and 100 μM, with EC50 near 10 μM for both compounds. Present findings suggest that endogenous excitatory amino acids may participate significantly in the propagation of central neuronal cell loss in response to a purely mechanical insult."
https://openalex.org/W2013195956,"The role of intracellular calcium in an APV-insensitive form of long-term potentiation (LTP) has been studied at the hippocampal mossy fiber synapse. Intracellular calcium was buffered by iontophoretic injection of either BAPTA or QUIN-2, into CA3 pyramidal neurons. The slow calcium-dependent after hyperpolarization was used as an indicator of buffering. LTP was elicited in control and in APV-treated cells (6/6 and 4/5 cell, respectively). In contrast, LTP was observed in only 2/9 BAPTA-loaded cells and in 1/4 QUIN-2-loaded cells. The magnitude of LTP for control and APV-treated cells were not significantly different, but both groups showed significantly greater LTP than BAPTA-loaded cells. These results suggest that an increase in postsynaptic calcium is required for the induction of mossy fiber LTP."
https://openalex.org/W1594886297,"The kinetics of activation of normal and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla)-deficient prothrombins isolated from cattle maintained for extended periods on the vitamin K antagonist dicoumarol were studied. The catalyst was prothrombinase, comprising isolated Factor Xa, Factor Va, phospholipid vesicles, and calcium ion. The Km and kcat values for prothrombins with 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and 10 Gla residues were determined both by initial rate analysis and by integrated Michaelis-Menten-Henri analysis. Each of the Gla-deficient prothrombins exhibited kcat values similar to that of normal 10-Gla prothrombin but Km values that were 8- to 20-fold greater than that of the normal molecule. The increased Km coincided with a loss of Ca2+- and phospholipid-binding properties of the Gla-deficient prothrombins. The magnitude of the defect in both the kinetics of activation and Ca2+ and phospholipid binding is not progressive with the loss of Gla residues but rather appears abruptly with the loss of as few as 3 of the 10 Gla residues present in the normal substrate. The theoretical relationship between Km(app) and the dissociation constant (Kd) of the prothrombin-phospholipid interactions was derived. According to the result, the increase in apparent Km observed with the Gla-deficient prothrombins corresponds to at least a 100- to 1000-fold decrease in affinity for phospholipid compared to the affinity of normal prothrombin. In addition, the products of the activation of 10-Gla prothrombin were found to inhibit the activation of the Gla-deficient prothrombins."
https://openalex.org/W2083194783,"Many of the genes in the regulatory hierarchy controlling sex determination in Drosophila melanogaster are known. Here we examine how this regulatory hierarchy controls the expression of the structural genes encoding the female-specific yolk polypeptides. Temperature shift experiments with a temperature-sensitive allele of the sex determination regulatory gene transformer-2 (tra-2) showed that tra-2+ function is required in the adult for both the sex-specific initiation and maintenance of YP synthesis. Control of the YP genes by this, regulatory hierarchy is at the level of transcription, or transcript stability. The results of temperature shift experiments with abdomens isolated from tra-2ts homozygotes support the notion that the tra-2+ function acts in a cell-autonomous manner to control YP synthesis. These results provide a paradigm for the way this regulatory hierarchy controls the terminal differentiation functions for sexually dimorphic development."

https://openalex.org/W2088760800,"We have investigated the regulation of actin assembly in whole mouse brain synaptosomes and how that regulation modulates neurotransmitter release. During a 30 s depolarization with high K+, filamentous actin (F-actin) levels, monitored by staining with rhodamine phalloidin, increase dramatically (up to 300% in 3 s), decrease, and increase once again. This F-actin cycling is regulated by pathways both dependent and independent of Ca2+ influx and is markedly affected by exposing synaptosomes to Li+, tetrodotoxin, and diacylglycerol. Measurement of [3H]norepinephrine release from synaptosomes containing entrapped agents that modulate actin assembly (DNAase I or phalloidin) indicates that actin depolymerization is necessary for normal release and that re polymerization limits release."
https://openalex.org/W1603039259,"A method is described for a rapid two-step purification of the membrane receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF) from cultured human A-431 cells. After solubilization of the cells with Triton X-100, the receptor is immobilized on an immunoaffinity column containing a monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor. In the second step of purification, the receptor, eluted from the antibody column, is adsorbed and specifically eluted from a lectin-agarose column. The molecular species obtained is mainly the 170,000-dalton EGF receptor polypeptide. The activity of the pure receptor depends on the conditions used for the desorption from the immunoaffinity beads. High-yield elution is obtained with acidic buffer and the receptor so purified specifically binds EGF, but is devoid of the kinase activity. When the elution is done with alkaline buffers or with buffer containing urea, a fully active receptor kinase is purified (yield of 10%). The pure receptor binds 125I-EGF with a Kd of 4 X 10(-8) M and retains EGF-sensitive protein kinase activity which phosphorylates tyrosine residues on the receptor itself. An additional protocol is described for large-scale purification (yield of 55%) of EGF receptor for the analysis of its primary structure. In this procedure, the EGF receptor is first purified by immunoaffinity chromatography which is followed by preparative gel electrophoresis of the 32P internally labeled receptor to remove minor protein contaminants."
https://openalex.org/W2111340976,"The Huntington's disease gene (HD) maps distal to the D4S10 marker in the terminal 4p16.3 subband of chromosome 4. Directed cloning has provided several DNA segments that have been grouped into three clusters on a physical map of approximately 5 × 106 by in 4p16.3. We have typed RFLPs in both reference and HD pedigrees to produce a fine-structure genetic map that establishes the relative order of the clusters and further narrows the target area containing the HD gene. Despite the large number of meiotic events examined, the HD gene cannot be positioned relative to the most distal cluster. One recombination event with HD suggests that the terminal-most markers flank the disease gene; two others favor a telomeric location for the defect. Efforts to isolate the HD gene must be divided between these two distinct intervals until additional genetic data resolve the apparent contradiction in localization."
https://openalex.org/W1529933235,"The phenobarbital-inducible P-450 forms IIB1 and IIB2 are identical in sequence except for 14 amino acid differences within the carboxyl-terminal half of the molecule. IIB1 has about a 5–10-fold higher turnover number for most monooxygenase substrates examined although the substrate specificities of both enzymes are virtually identical. Both P-450s oxygenate testosterone to yield the 16 α-hydroxy, 16β-hydroxy, 17-keto, and 16β-hydroxy, 17-keto metabolites as major products. A variant IIB2 cDNA, isolated from an uninduced rat liver γgt11 library, and when expressed in Hep G2 cells using a vaccinia virus vector, was found to code for a protein that produced the 16α-hydroxy and 17-keto metabolites of testosterone but no 16β-hydroxylated products. Although the published sequences of IIB1 and IIB2 are identical within the N-terminal halves of the proteins, sequence analysis of the variant cDNA revealed two amino acid substitutions in this region; Leu58→Phe and I1e114→Phe. When these two amino acid changes were incorporated into IIB1, via construction of a chimeric cDNA, the resultant expressed enzyme did not catalyze the 16β-hydroxylation of testosterone or androstenedione. Formation of the 16α-hydroxy and 17-keto metabolites, however, was only slightly reduced compared with the parent IIB1. A IIB1 protein that possessed only the I1e114→Phe replacement catalyzed the production of all four testosterone metabolites with only slightly different product ratios compared with the parent enzyme. The substrate specificity of a IIB1 variant containing only the Leu58→Phe replacement could not be determined, since that protein did not accumulate in cells infected with the corresponding recombinant vaccinia virus. These data suggest that two distinct amino acid residues located within the amino-terminal fourth of IIB1 and IIB2 can affect substrate orientation at the active site."

This procedure is superior to other assays because it is faster and detects viable intracellular as well as extracellular Leishmania. Furthermore, destruction of intracellular pathogens by macrophages is more accurately determined with fluorescein diacetate than with other stains. The procedure may have applications in programs to develop drugs and vaccines against protozoa responsible for human and animal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2031998266,"We have used a combination of histological, molecular, and genetic techniques to investigate the flightless Drosophila mutant raised. Electron microscopy of indirect flight muscles of raised homozygotes confirms that they are grossly abnormal, lacking thin filaments and Z discs. These defects correspond to aberrant protein accumulation in thoraces, where several myofibrillar components are reduced or absent. Utilizing the germ-line transformation technique we demonstrate that one genetic lesion associated with the raised phenotype resides within the act88F actin gene, which, as a result, fails to specify normal mRNA accumulation during thoracic muscle differentiation. We also provide evidence for a distinct second genetic lesion, which apparently eliminates proper posttranslational modification of two myofibrillar proteins, one of which is actin."
https://openalex.org/W2068508602,"The homodimer neurohormone precursor P1, consisting of 41 residue subunits or A-chains, is synthesized by the glandular neurosecretory cells of the corpora cardiaca (CC) of the locust Schistocerca gregaria. Processing of P1 generates two copies of a 10 amino acid peptide neurohormone (AKH I) and one copy of a homodimer peptide (APRP 1). Here we show that the P1 dimer is formed from two independent A-chain translation products. Translation of CC mRNA in vitro produces a prominent 6.4 kd protein, the synthesis of which can be blocked by oligonucleotides hybridizing to mRNA encoding the A-chain. Northern blot experiments suggest that the 6.4 kd protein is produced by an ∼500 base mRNA. cDNA cloning reveals a pre-A-chain structure in which a single copy of the A-chain is preceded by a 22 amino acid signal peptide. This evidence indicates that the PI dimer is synthesized by coupling of very small translational products rather than by folding and processing of a larger protein containing more than one copy of the A-chain."
https://openalex.org/W2050251438,"Bioluminescence in the hydrozoan coelenterate Obelia results from calcium activation of a photoprotein contained in light-emitting cells (photocytes) scattered in the animal's endoderm. The influx of calcium into nonluminescent endodermal cells through conventional voltage-dependent calcium channels is required for the excitation-luminescence coupling. Our results suggest that the subsequent diffusion of this calcium, via gap junctions, into the neighboring photocytes triggers a localized luminescence response. Following intense stimulation, the local rise in calcium elicits a secondary wave of luminescence that is supported by a voltage-independent calcium permeability mechanism in the photocyte plasma membrane. These two mechanisms for elevating internal calcium in light-emitting cells can account for the spatial and temporal features of intracellular luminescence in Obelia."

Specific binding was not observed with less biologically active (less than or equal to 10%) radioiodinated interferon. The bound radioiodinated interferon was shown to compete with human beta-interferon (HuIFN beta), rHuIFN beta Ser, human alpha-interferon (HuIFN alpha) and with human gamma-interferon (HuIFN gamma). Scatchard plot analyses suggest the presence of about 10,000 binding sites for HuIFN beta/Daudi cell. About 6,600 of these sites can be blocked by HuIFN alpha and 3,700 sites can be blocked by HuIFN gamma. The apparent Kd for HuIFN beta is 2.7 nM. The apparent Kd values for HuIFN alpha and HuIFN gamma are 3.7 and 1.1 nM, respectively. It was possible to demonstrate the cross-linking of HuIFN beta to two macromolecular components of Mr = 128,000 and 103,000. We propose the existence of at least two binding sites for HuIFN beta in Daudi cells, one site recognizing both HuIFN beta and HuIFN gamma, the other site recognizing both HuIFN beta and HuIFN alpha. Each site is capable of recognizing only HuIFN gamma or HuIFN alpha."

https://openalex.org/W1577503046,"Abstract The binding, internalization, and inhibition of transmitter release by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) was investigated using the intact toxin, its heavy (HC) or light (LC) chains, and a proteolytic fragment thereof. In Aplysia neurons, blockade of acetylcholine release upon external application of BoNT types A or E was prevented by reducing the temperature to 10 degrees C, due to arresting intoxication at the membrane binding step. At this low temperature, type A HC, H2 (comprised of the N-terminal of HC), or H2L (H2 disulfide-linked to LC) antagonized the neuroparalytic action of BoNT A or E, indicating that the latter bind saturably to common ecto-acceptor via the H2 region. In contrast, H2L was unable to counteract BoNT-induced paralysis at the murine neuromuscular junction. In accordance with this species difference, unlike native BoNT, saturable binding of 125I-labeled H2L could not be detected in mammalian peripheral or central nerve terminals. Possibly, more stringent structural requirements form the basis of the toxin's greater effectiveness in inhibiting neurotransmission at mouse nerve muscle synapses than Aplysia nerve terminals. In further identification of functional domains in the toxin, an unprocessed single-chain form of BoNT type E was found to be ineffective when applied extra- or intracellularly to Aplysia neurons. Notably, bath application of the latter to a neuron preinjected with HC, but not H2L or LC, resulted in a blockade of release. This shows that the single-chain species can become internalized and requires, not only LC, but also processed HC for its inhibitory action; consistently, the proteolyzed form of BoNT E was active."

https://openalex.org/W1572103594,"Hb Catonsville is an unstable variant in which glutamic acid is inserted into the alpha-globin chain between Pro-37(C2) and Thr-38(C3). The peptide sequence data are consistent with the DNA sequence of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment of the variant globin gene, which shows the insertion of the triplet codon--GAA--into the mutant alpha-globin gene. In the normal alpha-globin gene cluster the codon for glutamic acid is GAG rather than GAA. Thus, there are two features unique to Hb Catonsville, one the insertion of a single residue into the interior of the alpha-globin chain, and two the presence of the alternate codon for glutamic acid. The experimental evidence suggests that Hb Catonsville may be an example of nonhomologous nonallelic gene conversion, an observation not previously reported in this gene family. The mutation occurs in the critical alpha 1 beta 2 interface of the hemoglobin tetramer and leads to a variant with high oxygen affinity, a reduced cooperativity, and Bohr effect."

Although both were transcribed, only 5' Ak beta/3' H-2Dd transformants had significant cell membrane expression of a 30-40 kd, heterogeneous glycoprotein containing Ak beta 1 and H-2Dd (C2) serological epitopes. These transformants had a unique pattern of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies previously identified as requiring the Ak beta 1 domain for recognition of complete I-A molecules. These results allow new insight into the structural requirements for cell surface expression of proteins and provide unique cellular reagents for the dissection of humoral and cell-mediated recognition of MHC molecules."
