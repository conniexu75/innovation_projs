https://openalex.org/W1598451418,"Time courses for the autooxidation of native and mutant sperm whale and pig myoglobins were measured at 37 degrees C in the presence of catalase and superoxide dismutase. In sperm whale myoglobin, His64(E7) was replaced with Gln, Gly, Ala, Val, Thr, Leu, and Phe; Val68(E11) was replaced with Ala, Ile, Leu, and Phe; Leu29(B10) was replaced with Ala, Val, and Phe. In pig myoglobin, His64(E7) was replaced with Val; Val68(E11) was replaced with Thr and Ser; Thr67(E10) was replaced with Ala, Val, Glu, and Arg; Lys45(CD3) was replaced with Ser, Glu, His, and Arg. The observed pseudo-first order rate constants varied over 4 orders of magnitude, from 58 h-1 (H64A) to 0.055 h-1 (native) to 0.005 h-1 (L29F) at 37 degrees C, pH 7, in air. The dependences of the observed autooxidation rate constant on oxygen concentration and pH were measured for native and selected mutant myoglobins. In the native proteins and in most mutants still possessing the distal histidine, autooxidation occurs through a combination of two mechanisms. At high [O2], direct dissociation of the neutral superoxide radical (HO2) from oxymyoglobin dominates, and this process is accelerated by decreasing pH. At low [O2], autooxidation occurs by a bimolecular reaction between molecular oxygen and deoxymyoglobin containing a weakly coordinated water molecule. The neutral side chain of the distal histidine (His64) inhibits autooxidation by hydrogen bonding to bound oxygen, preventing both HO2 dissociation and the oxidative bimolecular reaction with deoxymyoglobin. Replacement of His64 by amino acids incapable of hydrogen bonding to the bound ligand markedly increases the rate of autooxidation and causes the superoxide mechanism to predominate. Increasing the polarity of the distal pocket by substitution of Val68 with Ser and Thr accelerates autooxidation, presumably by facilitating protonation of the Fe(II).O2 complex. Increasing the net anionic charge at the protein surface in the vicinity of the heme group also enhances the rate of autooxidation. Decreasing the volume of the distal pocket by replacing small amino acids with larger aliphatic or aromatic residues at positions 68 (E11) and 29 (B10) inhibits autooxidation markedly by decreasing the accessibility of the iron atom to solvent water molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1764864278,"As part of our ongoing search for novel antimicrobial agents and their use in singular or combined drug therapy, we have isolated a series of polypeptides from the lymph fluid of honeybees. These polypeptides are synthesized de novo, following experimental infection of the insect with live Escherichia coli cells, and confer a broad-spectrum antibacterial defense to the host. We have dissected this humoral immune system into its constituent components. In addition to the previously characterized apidaecins and abaecin, we also isolated a member of the defensin family of and, now, a novel 93-amino acid long, cationic polypeptide, termed hymenoptaecin. Detailed analysis established the complete chemical structure, including a 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid at the N terminus, and indicated major differences with all known antibacterial polypeptides. Under physiological conditions, it inhibits viability of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including several human pathogens. Lethal effects against E. coli are secondary to sequential permeabilization of outer and inner membrane. In combination, the six-constituent peptide antibiotics of bee lymph provide wide-spectrum antibacterial protection in vitro by virtue of complementarity rather than synergism."
https://openalex.org/W1592923741,"The B lymphocyte cell surface receptor CD22 is an adhesion molecule that can mediate binding to several leukocyte subsets. The first CD22 ligand to be identified was the receptor-linked phosphotyrosine phosphatase CD45, but several lines of evidence suggest that CD22 may interact with multiple counter receptors on adjacent lymphocytes. In the present work, we show that in addition to CD45, a soluble CD22-immunoglobulin fusion protein (CD22Rg) recognizes several other distinct lymphocyte sialoglycoproteins. CD22-mediated adhesion is dependent upon the presence of sialic acids on ligands. CD22Rg is observed to bind specifically to a 115-kDa sialoglycoprotein in COS cells transfected with an alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase cDNA, but not in COS cells transfected with unrelated cDNA clones, indicating that at least some CD22-mediated interactions require presentation of sialic acid in an alpha-2,6 linkage by CD22 ligands. In all cases, truncation of the side chain of sialic acids by mild periodate oxidation abolishes recognition by CD22Rg. Direct binding of CD22Rg to lymphoid cells also requires sialic acids and their side chains. Taken together, these observations indicate that CD22 is a sialic acid-binding lectin and may define a novel functional subset of immunoglobulin superfamily adhesion molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2152787769,"CD22 beta is a glycoprotein found on the surface of B cells during restricted stages of development. It is believed to play a role in cell-cell interactions and B cell activation. The accompanying paper (Sgroi, D., Varki, A., Braesch-Andersen, S., and Stamenkovic, I. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7011-7018) shows that CD22 beta recognizes multiple glycoproteins on the surfaces of T and B cells and that sialylation of these ligands is essential for binding. To identify the structure(s) of the sialylated oligosaccharide(s) recognized by CD22 beta, [3H]glucosamine-labeled glycoproteins were purified from Daudi cells by adsorption onto a CD22 beta recombinant immunoglobulin (CD22 beta Rg) chimera attached to protein A-Sepharose (PAS), and the N-linked oligosaccharides were released by peptide N-glycosidase F. These released oligosaccharides failed to bind to CD22 beta Rg-PAS under the conditions used initially to adsorb the glycoproteins, but their elution from a column of CD22 beta Rg-PAS was significantly retarded. Populations of oligosaccharides with different affinities could be identified by their order of elution. Specific sialidases were used to determine the content of alpha-2,3- and alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid in these different populations and their contribution to binding. Multiantennary oligosaccharides with one alpha-2,6-linked residue bound marginally, and those with two or more bound more tightly. alpha-2,3-Linked sialic acid residues were without effect. Binding did not require divalent cations and was abrogated by mild periodate oxidation of the outer side chain of sialic acid. No marked differences in size or fucose content were found between the populations of high and low affinity oligosaccharides. However, the low affinity population could be partially converted into higher affinity by treatment with beta-galactoside alpha-2,6 sialyltransferase and CMP-sialic acid. Thus, CD22 beta is a mammalian lectin that can recognize specific N-linked oligosaccharide structures containing alpha-2,6-linked sialic acids."
https://openalex.org/W1498072405,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and growth regulatory gene/melanoma growth stimulatory activity (GRO/MGSA) are small polypeptide molecules involved in the chemotactic response of certain cell types. Two receptors have been described which interact with IL-8, designated type 1 and type 2. IL-8 binds with high affinity to both receptors, whereas GRO/MGSA and neutrophil-activating peptide-2 demonstrate a high degree of binding only to the type 2 receptor. The two forms of IL-8 receptor are members of the rhodopsin seven-helix membrane-spanning superfamily, and share a high degree of overall homology, although the amino termini are very divergent. By using conserved restriction enzyme sites, a series of chimeric IL-8 receptor molecules were constructed between the type 1 and type 2 receptors and transfected into human 293 kidney epithelial cells. These chimeric molecules altered regions of the receptor presented to the ligand. The ability of the chimeric receptors to bind IL-8 was determined, as well as the ability of IL-8 and GRO/MGSA to inhibit radiolabeled IL-8 binding. The amino terminus of the IL-8 receptors was found to be important for differential binding of GRO/MGSA and IL-8. In addition, a series of peptides was also constructed to further investigate which residues of IL-8 receptor interact with IL-8. These peptides also identified the amino-terminal sequence of the IL-8 receptors as being important in interacting with IL-8."
https://openalex.org/W1547722704,"Activation of human platelets by complement proteins, C5b-9, thrombin plus collagen, or a Ca2+ ionophore results in surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS), accompanied by the expression of membrane catalytic activity for the tenase (VIIaIXa) and prothrombinase (VaXa) coagulation enzyme complexes. The mechanism underlying this surface exposure of PS upon platelet activation remains unresolved. Using fluorescent derivatives of PS (NBD-PS), we have investigated how the transmembrane migration of PS is related to microvesiculation of the platelet plasma membrane and to fusion of storage granules with the plasma membrane. Gel-filtered platelets were incubated with NBD-PS, allowing 90 +/- 10% of the incorporated NBD-PS to accumulate into the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Migration of NBD-PS from the inner leaflet to the plasma membrane surface was monitored by time-based flow cytometry, and correlated with the appearance of platelet microparticles and alpha-granule secretion. Platelet activation by C5b-9 or the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, increased surface exposure of NBD-PS, due to acceleration of the apparent rate of migration from inner to outer plasma membrane leaflets. The onset of this accelerated migration of NBD-PS to the surface coincided with the onset of plasma membrane vesiculation, and the NBD-PS that partitioned into the membrane of the shed microparticle was also rapidly exposed to the surface (t1/2"
https://openalex.org/W1595430911,"We have previously shown that the residues Glu4-Leu5-Arg6 (ELR) preceding the first cysteine at the N terminus of the 72-residue form of interleukin-8 (IL-8) are essential for receptor binding and neutrophil activation (Clark-Lewis, I., Schumacher, C., Baggiolini, M., and Moser, B. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 23128-23134). We have now synthesized a series of analogs of IL-8(4-72), the truncated form of IL-8 with the N-terminal sequence ELRC, as potential IL-8 antagonists. Among 26 analogs with deletions or amino acid replacements in the ELR region several inhibited IL-8 function. The most potent were IL-8(6-72), with Arg6 at the N terminus, and IL-8,AAR(7-72) with N-terminal Ala4-Ala5 instead of Glu4-Leu5. They inhibited IL-8 receptor binding, exocytosis (IC50 0.3 microM), as well as chemotaxis and the respiratory burst. Inhibition was restricted to responses elicited by IL-8, GRO alpha, or NAP-2, and no effect was observed when the unrelated agonists fMet-Leu-Phe or C5a were used as stimuli. These results demonstrate that selective antagonists that prevent or attenuate the action of IL-8 and its related chemotactic cytokines are obtained by modification of the ELR sequence at the N terminus."
https://openalex.org/W1607890390,"The expression of stromelysin, a major matrix metalloproteinase of connective tissues, is regulated by several cytokines, growth factors, protooncogenes as well as by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The human stromelysin gene promoter contains an activator protein-1 (Fos/Jun) binding site at -70, which is required for basal expression but is not necessary for the TPA response. In this study, using promoter deletion mutants in transient gene transfection experiments, we first identify the sequence from -220 to -202 as necessary for the TPA response of the stromelysin gene. Further, among the restriction fragments from the 1.3-kilobase long promoter, only the proximal fragment (-274 to -101) conferred a TPA response on the heterologous thymidine kinase gene promoter. The -220 to -202 sequence contains two copies of a motif similar to the polyomavirus enhancer A-binding protein-3 (PEA-3) site, which binds the Ets family of oncoproteins and transcription factors. Point mutations of either one of the two PEA-3 sites, in the 1.3-kilobase long stromelysin promoter context, reduced basal gene expression. However, only the mutation of the proximal, but not the distal PEA-3 site, significantly inhibited the TPA response. In cotransfection experiments, the Ets-2 protein transactivated the stromelysin promoter and the promoter proximal fragment containing the PEA-3 sites but not the promoters containing mutated PEA-3 sites. These data suggest that the PEA-3 site, but not the activator protein-1 site, and Ets-2 protein have a major role in the TPA induction of the human stromelysin gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1489272761,"Immunoglobulin-binding protein (BiP), a 70-kDa heat shock protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, binds transiently to nascent proteins, releasing them upon folding and assembly. The in vitro release of bound proteins from BiP requires ATP hydrolysis. Recently, the three-dimensional structure was solved for an ATP-hydrolyzing proteolytic 44-kDa fragment of a 71-kDa heat shock cognate protein, HSC71. Because of the high degree of homology in this region, BiP presumably forms a similar ATP binding structure. Amino-terminal deletions in BiP eliminated ATP-agarose binding. Alteration of a second potential ATP binding site had no effect, suggesting that only the HSC71-like site was capable of ATP binding. Crystallographic data from HSC71 implicated certain amino acids in interactions with the beta-phosphate, gamma-phosphate, and divalent cation of ATP. Mutation of each corresponding residue in BiP (Thr-37, Thr-229, and Glu-201) severely inhibited its ATPase activity. These BiP mutants were still capable of binding ATP and immunoglobulin heavy chains, suggesting that these mutations did not drastically alter the structure of BiP. They did however block the ATP-mediated release of heavy chains from BiP. Our results demonstrate that the structure of BiP in this region must be extremely similar to that elucidated for HSC71 and that mutations of residues proposed to interact with ATP block the ATP-mediated release of bound protein by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2147145439,"The relationship of enzyme structure to substrate specificity for the matrix metalloproteinases interstitial collagenase and stromelysin-2 has been investigated by analysis of the cleavage specificity of recombinant human collagenase-stromelysin-2 hybrid proteins and C terminally truncated collagenase and stromelysin-2. Two series of chimeric proteins were devised by progressive substitution of exon-encoded domains. The recombinant proteins were expressed in COS-7 cells as protein A-fusion proteins and purified on an IgG affinity matrix. Treatment with 4-amino-phenylmercuric acetate released active metalloproteinase of the sizes predicted for the chimeric proteins. Active forms of both the chimeric protein series and the short form enzymes expressed both casein- and gelatin-degrading activities. Like stromelysin, the catalytic activity of stromelysin-2 was contained in the N-terminal domain (encoded by exons 1-5) and was apparently independent of the C-terminal domain (encoded by exons 6-10). Only full-length collagenase displayed a triple helicase (collagenolytic) activity; no combination of N- or C-terminal collagenase domains fused with stromelysin-2 domains had such activity. This suggests that the triple helicase activity is a composite of elements derived from both halves of the collagenase molecule. C terminally truncated collagenase (exons 1-5) and a hybrid of collagenase exons 1-5 and stromelysin-2 exons 6-10 cleaved denatured type I collagen (gelatin) to generate diagnostic peptides in gelatin fingerprint assays. When exon 5 (the exon encoding the zinc-binding domain) was derived from stromelysin-2, the enzyme specificity in the fingerprint assay changed to that of native stromelysin-2. In contrast, when exon 5 was derived from collagenase, the specificity reflected that of the parent enzyme. Our data also suggest that mismatching of exons 2 and 5 destabilizes the enzyme, presumably by altering the geometry of the propeptide-zinc-binding site interaction. We conclude that the loss of triple helicase collagenolytic activity is not accompanied by a shift to the broad specificity characteristic of stromelysin. Rather, the zinc-binding domain confers a distinct cleavage specificity on each metalloproteinase."
https://openalex.org/W1579270220,"The mechanism for tissue-specific differences in apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA editing efficiency is not known. Structural data are presented which demonstrate tissue-specific, quantitative differences in the high order complexes containing apoB mRNA editing activity and RNA-binding proteins. The bulk of rat enterocyte extract editing activity sedimented at 11 S with an additional 5-10% at 60 S. Rat liver extract activity was less abundant and only sedimented at 60 S. Ultraviolet light cross-linking revealed two protein activities of approximately 66 and 44 kDa which specifically associated with apoB RNA substrates and cosedimented with editing activity. Extracts differed in the cross-linking yield of p66 and p44 and kinetically, enterocyte RNA-protein complexes reached maximum abundance more rapidly than those in liver extracts. Both 60 and 11 S forms of the editing activity redistributed to 27 S during in vitro editosome assembly. The redistribution of editing activities was accompanied by a corresponding redistribution of p66/p44 to 27 S. The data demonstrate that p66 and p44 are common to liver and enterocyte 27 S editosome assembly processes and suggest that differences in both the pre-editosomal assembly state of editing factors and their abundance may be mechanistically important for tissue-specific differences in editing efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1591177416,"Insulin receptor beta subunit autophosphorylation occurs in an intramolecular trans-reaction in which one beta subunit phosphorylates the adjacent beta subunit within an alpha 2 beta 2 holoreceptor complex (Frattali, A. L., Treadway, J. L., and Pessin, J. E. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 19521-19528). To determine the spatial relationship between alpha subunit occupancy and beta subunit autophosphorylation, the vaccinia virus/bacteriophage T7 transient expression system was used to generate insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 hybrid receptors. The extent of hybrid receptor formation was proportional to the molar ratio of the insulin and IGF-1 receptor expression plasmids used for transfection of cultured fibroblasts. Insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors displayed high affinity binding for insulin and IGF-1 similar to that observed for homotypic insulin and IGF-1 receptors, respectively. As expected, insulin poorly competed for 125I-IGF-1 binding to the insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors compared with IGF-1. IGF-1, however, competed more efficiently than insulin for 125I-insulin binding, indicating interactions between the alpha subunit binding sites. Furthermore, insulin or IGF-1 stimulated the autophosphorylation of both beta subunits within wild type insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors. Ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation of two different mutant/wild type insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors also resulted in the labeling of each beta subunit independent of which alpha subunit was occupied with ligand. These data demonstrate that insulin/IGF-1 hybrid receptors bind both ligands with high affinity and that occupancy of either alpha subunit results in a series of intramolecular trans-autophosphorylation reactions between beta subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1565405983,"Protein 4.1's interaction with the erythroid skeletal proteins spectrin and actin and its essential role in regulating membrane strength are both attributable to expression of an alternatively spliced 63-nucleotide exon. The corresponding 21-amino acid (21-aa) cassette is within the previously identified spectrin-actin binding domain (10 kDa molecular mass) of erythroid protein 4.1. This cassette is absent, however, in several isoforms that are generated by tissue- and development-specific RNA splicing. Four isoforms of the 10-kDa domain were constructed for comparative assessment of functions particularly relevant to red cells. In vitro translated isoforms containing the 21-aa cassette, denoted 10k21 and 10k19,21, were able to bind spectrin, stabilize spectrin-actin complexes, and associate with red cell membrane. Isoforms replacing or lacking the 21-aa cassette, 10k19 and 10k0, did not function in these assays. A bacterially expressed fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase, designated GST-10k21, congealed spectrin-actin into a network in vitro as found with purified protein 4.1. Additionally, incorporation of GST-10k21 into mechanically weak, 4.1-deficient membranes increased mechanical strength of these membranes to normal. GST-10k19 did not function in these assays. These results show that the 21-aa sequence in protein 4.1 is critical to mechanical integrity of the red cell membrane. These results also allow the role of protein 4.1 in membrane mechanics to be interpreted primarily in terms of its spectrin-actin binding function. Alternatively expressed sequences within the 10-kDa domain of nonerythroid protein 4.1 are suggested to have different, yet to be defined functions."
https://openalex.org/W1498791588,"ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs), a family of approximately 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins that activate cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase in vitro, have been implicated in intracellular protein trafficking and are thought to cycle between cytosolic and membrane compartments. Although isolated predominantly as soluble proteins, ARFs associate with membranes and phospholipids in a GTP-dependent manner. In contrast to other small GTP-binding proteins, ARFs are NH2 terminally myristoylated. Using a bacterial expression system, recombinant myristoylated and non-myristoylated human ARF5 were produced to investigate the role of myristoylation in its association with Golgi. The recombinant ARFs (myristoylated and non-myristoylated) exhibited similar biochemical activity as measured by GTP binding and in vitro activation of cholera toxin. Myristoylated ARF5, however, demonstrated a temperature- and GTP-dependent association with Golgi membranes, whereas non-myristoylated ARF did not bind to Golgi under any of the experimental conditions. These data indicate that myristoylation is necessary, although not sufficient, for membrane attachment, but is not necessary for activation of cholera toxin."
https://openalex.org/W1543394342,"We have isolated and characterized three genes coding for hFc gamma RIIA, IIB, and IIC. Each gene spans approximately 15-19 kilobases of DNA and consists of eight exons. Two exons encode the 5'-untranslated region and signal peptides, two exons code for homologous Ig-like extracellular domains, a single exon encodes the transmembrane spanning region, and three exons encode the cytoplasmic domains and 3'-untranslated regions. Analysis of gene structures support the concept that the hFc gamma RIIA and hFc gamma RIIB genes originated via gene duplication and divergence processes. The hFc gamma RIIC gene, however, showed a remarkable homology at its 5' end with the hFc gamma RIIB gene, whereas its 3' region was highly homologous with the hFc gamma RIIA gene, suggesting that the hFc gamma RIIC gene results from an unequal crossover event between the hFc gamma RIIA and IIB genes. This hypothesis was supported by nucleotide sequence analyses of the putative break-point region. The proposed site of recombination was located approximately 300 nucleotides downstream from the sixth (C1) exon. These data provide a unique model for the evolutionary generation of a receptor family with multiple biological functions."
https://openalex.org/W2064808095,"Hyaluronic acid is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan composed of repeating subunits of glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine. It is synthesized by the group A streptococcal membrane-associated enzyme hyaluronate synthase. In previous reports, the locus required for expression of hyaluronic acid, the has operon, was identified and found to consist of two genes, hasA and hasB encoding hyaluronate synthase and UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, respectively. Since a transcription terminator was not found at the end of hasB, it was the aim of this study to identify the remaining gene(s) in the has operon. By utilizing the Tn1000 method of DNA sequencing and inverse polymerase chain reaction, hasC, the third gene in the has operon was shown to be 915 base pairs in length (304 amino acids) and located 192 base pairs downstream of hasB. Sequence similarities to other genes suggested that hasC encodes UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Overexpression of hasC using isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside induction of the T7 promoter in the pET translation system allowed for the production of bacterial extracts from Escherichia coli that possessed increased UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity as compared to nondetectable levels in extracts with vector alone. In addition, expression of HasC resulted in a protein of approximately 36 kDa as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These data as well as complementation analysis of hasC in an E. coli galU mutant confirmed that hasC encodes UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Finally, since sequence analysis identified a potential rho-independent transcription terminator at the 3-prime terminus of the gene, hasC is the third and probably the final gene in the has operon.

Group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes) are human pathogens that colonize the skin and mucous membranes of their host. They cause localized infections and nonsupperative sequelae such as post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and rheumatic fever(1Veasy L.G. Wiedmeier S.E. Orsmond G.S. Ruttenberg H.D. Boucek M.M. Roth S.J. Tait V.F. Thompson J.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1987; 316: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Prior to 1985, the occurrence of lethal streptococcal infections was quite rare. However, a rise in the number of streptococcal diseases within the past decade has led to increased investigation into the mechanisms involved in the resurgence of disease. One potential explanation for this increased pathogenicity of group A streptococci could be that the bacteria have evolved enhanced virulence determinants that assist in the pathogenesis of the organism. The primary virulence factor for group A streptococci is the M protein. M protein is a coiled-coil dimeric molecule present on the surface of streptococci that has been shown to interfere with phagocytic uptake of the organism by neutrophils and protect the organism from clearance(2Lancefield R.C. J. Immunol. 1962; 89: 307-313PubMed Google Scholar). The hyaluronic acid capsule has also been shown to be involved in the pathogenicity of group A streptococci. It has been observed that clinical isolates from outbreaks of rheumatic fever are highly encapsulated as compared to nonpathogenic strains(3Johnson D.R. Stevens D.L. Kaplan E.L. J Infect. Dis. 1992; 166: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 4Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Three percent of isolates from patients with uncomplicated pharyngitis (group I) possess a hyaluronate capsule, whereas 21% of isolates from severe streptococcal infections (group II), and 42% of rheumatic fever isolates (group III) exhibit a capsule. However, in the most frequently isolated group A streptococcal serotype, M1, the frequency of capsule production is even greater: 6% for group I, 22% for group II, and 80% for group III. These data support the hypothesis that the hyaluronic acid capsule is a major virulence determinant for group A streptococci in the human host. To demonstrate that the hyaluronic acid capsule is necessary for pathogenesis of group A streptococci, Wessels et al.(5Wessels M.R. Moses A.E. Goldberg J.B. DiCesare T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8317-8321Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 6Wessels M.R. Goldberg J.B. Moses A.E. DiCesare T.J. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 433-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have created acapsular mutants via transposon mutagenesis that exhibited increased sensitivity to phagocytic killing in human blood, whereas the encapsulated wild-type strains survived killing. These same acapsular mutants were also less virulent in mice as compared to the wild-type streptococci. In addition, Wessels and Bronze (7Wessels M.R. Bronze M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12238-12242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) showed that the hyaluronate capsule is necessary for early colonization of the pharynx and may be required for invasion of group A streptococci from the pharynx to produce a disseminated infection. These results suggested that the hyaluronic acid capsule may provide a selective advantage over the unencapsulated phenotype for group A streptococci. Hyaluronic acid is a high molecular weight glycosaminoglycan that is synthesized by the alternate addition of UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine by the streptococcal membrane-associated enzyme hyaluronate synthase(8Markovitz A.

The has operon was found to consist of at least two genes, hasA and hasB. hasA was shown to encode hyaluronate synthase(11Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have created two monospecific antibodies raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to portions of HasA. Both antibodies recognized a 42-kDa protein from group A streptococci and a recombinant protein from Escherichia coli containing hasA on a plasmid. hasB was shown to encode UDP-glucose dehydrogenase(10Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a transposon insertion in hasA created a polar effect on hasB expression, providing evidence that the genes are transcribed by the same promoter. Since sequence analysis of DNA downstream of hasA did not reveal any terminator-like sequences(11Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the hasA promoter could regulate transcription of the entire operon and thereby produce a polycistronic message. Recently, it was demonstrated by Northern blot analyses that hasA, hasB, and hasC are located on the same mRNA transcript (4.2 kb), ( 1The abbreviations used are: kbkilobaseIPTGisopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranosidePCRpolymerase chain reactionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.) thus confirming the observation that the genes are components of an operon(14Crater D.L. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). kilobase isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In this report, the sequence of the third gene (hasC) of the has operon is presented. hasC is located 192 nucleotides downstream of hasB and contains a potential rho-independent terminator at the 3-prime end of the gene, thus suggesting that hasC is the last gene in the has operon. Sequence comparisons and T7 overexpression of hasC demonstrated that hasC encodes UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, an enzyme which catalyzes the production of UDP-glucose from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP. The streptococcal strain used in this study (WF51, T18) was grown in CDM(16van de Rijn I. Kessler R.E. Infect. Immun. 1980; 27: 444-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains used were JM109, BL21(DE3), DPWC, BW26(17Strathmann M. Hamilton B.A. Mayeda C.A. Simon M.I. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and DEV6 (gift from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center, Yale University; lacZ105 λ-, galU65, relA1, spoT1, thi-1) (18Remes B. Elseviers D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1054-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) grown in Luria broth or TYPG (16 g of tryptone, 16 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, 2.5 g of K2PO4, and 5 g of glucose/liter of H2O; see (10Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) medium as indicated. Plasmids used in this study include pGAC144(10Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), pGAC312 (this study), pGAC315 (this study), pMOB(17Strathmann M. Hamilton B.A. Mayeda C.A. Simon M.I. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), pBluescript (Stratagene), pET11a(19Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), pLysE(19Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), and pLysS(19Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Streptococcal chromosomal DNA was purified as per Dougherty and van de Rijn(9Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1291-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified from E. coli cultures (3 ml) by the alkaline lysis procedure (20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1987Google Scholar) or Wizard Mini-Preps (Promega, Madison, WI) and resuspended in a final volume of 100 μl of TE (100 μl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). DNA restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega and used according to the manufacturer's suggestions. The 0.9-kb EcoRI/HindIII of pGAC144 was subcloned into the miniplasmid pMOB for sequencing utilizing the Tn1000 protocol as per Strathmann et al.(17Strathmann M. Hamilton B.A. Mayeda C.A. Simon M.I. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Briefly, pMOB containing the 0.9-kb EcoRI/HindIII fragment was transformed into the host strain DPWC (which contains Tn1000 on the F factor) by the one-step method(20Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1987Google Scholar). The F factor was then transferred to the recipient strain BW26 by conjugation and positive colonies were selected for on LB agar plates containing carbenicillin and kanamycin (100 μg/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively). Twenty individual colonies were subjected to PCR to determine the position of insertion of the transposon within the target gene. Akaline lysis miniprep DNA (40 μl) was used as the template for double-stranded sequencing with Sequenase version 2.0 (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). To sequence the remaining 3-prime fragment of hasC, chromosomal DNA from streptococcal strain WF51 was digested with XbaI and BglII and electrophoresed, and a 3-5.5-kb region was extracted from the gel and purified using β-agarase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The ends of the isolated fragments were blunted and ligated, creating a cirular piece of DNA that spans from the BglII site in the 5-prime region of hasA (11Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the XbaI site downstream of hasC. The DNA was then subjected to inverse PCR using oligonucleotides D-10 (5′-CTTAGAACACCCACAGGTC-3′) and D-11 (5′-CATTTGGATAGATATAAGTATC-3′) as primers. The 1.4-kb PCR product was gel-purified by β-agarase and subjected to double-stranded DNA sequencing using Sequenase version 2.0. This process starting with PCR was repeated three times with identical results obtained each time. The complete sequence of hasC was determined by utilizing the fragment assembly program of the GCG software package(21Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar). BESTFIT and PILEUP, additional GCG programs, were used to align other sequences in the data base with hasC. FOLDRNA was used to determine the secondary structure of hasC. pGAC315 or pET11a was transformed into the E. coli galU mutant strain DEV6 (18Remes B. Elseviers D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1054-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and single colonies were grown in chromogenic medium (3 ml; 1% polypeptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 2% galactose, 0.003% bromthymol blue, 0.5 mM IPTG, 50 μg/ml ampicillin) (22Hossain S.A. Tanizawa K. Kazuta Y. Fukui T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) at 37°C. Complementation was judged successful by a color change of the culture supernatant from green to yellow that demonstrated the ability of the hasC-complemented mutant to produce acid from growth in galactose. In order to express hasC, chromosomal DNA isolated from WF51 was subjected to PCR using oligonucleotide D-34a (5′-GCACATATGACCAAAGTCAGAAAAG-3′) to incorporate an NdeI site at the 5-prime end of hasC and oligonucleotide D-37a (5′-GCAGGATCCAAGTACCAACACATTACTTTG-3′) to incorporate a BamHI site at the 3-prime end for further subcloning into the translation vector pET11a. The 925-base pair PCR product was subjected to T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega) in order to phosphorylate the ends and then subcloned into SmaI-digested pBluescript II (KS-) to create pGAC312. Next, hasC was removed from pGAC312 by restriction digestion with NdeI and BamHI and finally subcloned into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET11a to create pGAC315. pGAC315 was transformed into E. coli strains BL-21(DE3), BL-21(DE3)(pLysE), and BL-21(DE3)(pLysS) in order for T7 expression experiments. As a plasmid control, pET11a was also transformed into the above strains. T7 overexpression of hasC was achieved as per Studier et al.(19Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). Briefly, TYPG (5 ml) was inoculated with a single microcolony from the above transformations, and grown at 37°C until the optical density of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.6. At this point, 1 ml of the culture was removed as a preinduction sample, and IPTG (1 mM final concentration) was added to the remaining culture followed by a further incubation period. Additional 1-ml samples were taken at 2 and 3 h post-IPTG induction, and the samples were sedimented at 13,000 × g for 10 s and finally resuspended in TE. Sample buffer (60 μl) was added to each sample and boiled for 5 min to solubilize the cells. Thirty microliters of preinduction lysates and 10 μl of 2- and 3-h lysates were loaded per lane on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and electrophoresed as per Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). For overexpression of larger quantities of HasC for enzymatic assays, TYPG media (50 ml) was inoculated with 500 μl of an overnight culture of BL-21(DE3)(pLysS)(pGAC315) or BL-21(DE3)(pLysS)(pET11a) and grown to OD600 = 0.9. A preinduction sample (8.5 ml) was removed from the culture, IPTG (1 mM final concentration) was added to the remaining culture, and the incubation was resumed. Aliquots (8.5 ml) were removed from each of the cultures at 3 h postinduction. The samples were sedimented at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in enzyme buffer (1 ml, 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.7) for subsequent enzyme assays. Bacterial cells were disrupted by glass bead breakage as per Dougherty and van de Rijn(10Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Modifications of the procedure included the buffer used for prewashing the glass beads and resuspension of the bacterial cells (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.7), and the cells were broken only two times in the minibead breaker. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity was monitored using the coupled reaction with the enzymes phosphoglucomutase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase as described by Joshi (24Joshi J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and modified by Fjaervik et al.(25Fjaervik E. Frydenlund K. Valla S. Huggirat Y. Benziman M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 77: 325-330Crossref Google Scholar). Potassium phosphate (50 mM, pH 8.7) was substituted for the reaction buffer since the imidazole-HCl buffer inhibited the streptococcal enzyme. The reaction was initiated upon addition of crude enzyme (10 μl) to a 1-ml cuvette containing assay buffer (750 μl, prewarmed to 30°C). The subsequent reduction of NADP at 340 nm was monitored using a Spectronic 2000 (Bausch & Lomb), and the reaction rate was calculated from the initial linear portion of the curve (reduction of NADP versus time). Only trace amounts, if any, of reducing activity were found in the extracts in the absence of UDP-glucose, and the values were subtracted from the data. Protein concentration was determined by the Markwell et al.(26Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar) assay using duplicate samples and BSA as standard. A unit of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 μmol of NADPH/min at 30°C. Further analysis of pGAC144, a clone that contained the 3-prime region of hasB and approximately 1 kb of additional DNA(10Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), identified an open reading frame 192 nucleotides downstream of hasB. In order to sequence this open reading frame, the 0.9-kb EcoRI/HindIII fragment of pGAC144 (beginning 130 nucleotides downstream of hasB) was subcloned into the minivector pMOB and subjected to Tn1000 sequencing as per Strathmann et al.(17Strathmann M. Hamilton B.A. Mayeda C.A. Simon M.I. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1247-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The open reading frame, designated hasC, was shown to initiate 62 nucleotides downstream of the EcoRI site (Fig. 1); however, the 3-prime end of the gene (up to the HindIII site) did not contain a stop codon. Additional experiments were initiated to determine the sequence of the remaining portion of hasC. Chromosomal DNA was isolated from WF51 (the prototype encapsulated strain of group A streptococci), cloned to form a circular piece of DNA, and subjected to inverse PCR using primers D-10 and D-11 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The 1.4-kb PCR product was then sequenced using hasC primers to complete the sequence of hasC. A termination codon (TAA) was found 39 nucleotides (12 amino acids) downstream of the HindIII site of pGAC144, thus identifying the end of hasC. hasC was demonstrated to consist of 915 base pairs (304 amino acids, approximately 33.7 kDa) and possesses a potential Shine-Delgarno sequence (Fig. 1; RBS, base pairs 176-184) capable of base pairing with the 3-prime terminus of the streptococcal 16 s rRNA(27Ludwig W. Seewaldt E. Kilpper-Balz R. Schleifer K.H. Magrum L. Woese C.R. Fox G.E. Stackebrandt E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1985; 131: 543-551PubMed Google Scholar). Weak -35 and -10 sites were observed upstream of the hasC start codon; however, primer extension analysis did not identify a transcription start site directly upstream of hasC (data not shown), and Northern analyses demonstrated that hasC was part of the 4.2-kb has operon transcript(14Crater D.L. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). A potential transcriptional terminator was located within the 3-prime end of hasC spanning an additional 24 base pairs past the hasC termination codon. These data suggested that hasC is the third and last gene in the has operon. Sequence comparisons using the FASTA program of the Genetics Computer Group software package (21Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11536) Google Scholar) revealed that hasC shows homology to other genes that encode UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. HasC displayed 71.2% identity (initn, 1682) to Cps3U from type 3 Streptococcus pneumoniae(28Dillard J.P. Vandersea M.W. Yother J. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 973-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2), 63.5% identity (initn, 667) to GtaB from Bacillus subtilis(29Varon D. Boylan S.A. Okamoto K. Price C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3964-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 57.5% identity (initn, 432) to E. coli GalU(30Weissborn A.C. Liu Q. Rumley M.K. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2611-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 53.6% identity (initn, 218) to CelA of Acetobacter xylinum(31Brede G. Fjaervik E. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7042-7045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 52.8% identity (initn, 178) to Rhizobium meliloti ExoN(32Glucksmann M.A. Reuber T.L. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7045-7055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The lysine residue essential for catalytic activity of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from potato tuber has previously been determined(33Katsube T. Kazuta Y. Tanizawa K. Fukui T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8546-8551Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Alignment of the surrounding 9 amino acid residues with HasC and Cps3U demonstrated homology with 6 residues including the catalytic lysine (Fig. 2). Further experimentation is required to determine whether this lysine is involved in catalysis in the streptococcal enzyme. To confirm that hasC encodes UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, pGAC315 or pET11a were transformed into DEV6, an E. coli K-12 strain that has a mutation in galU and is therefore deficient in UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity(18Remes B. Elseviers D. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1054-1056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After growth in chromogenic medium containing bromthymol blue, the clone containing pGAC315 produced acid from galactose as exhibited by the color change from green to yellow. JM109 cells (galU+) served as a positive control. However, the clone that contained the vector without hasC or untransformed DEV6 were unable to ferment galactose. These observations further indicated that hasC encodes UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. To determine the molecular size of its gene product, hasC was subcloned under the control of the T7 promoter in the pET11a translation vector (see “Experimental Procedures”). For T7 expression, transformants harboring pGAC315 or pET11a were grown in TYPG and induced with 1 mM IPTG. Transformants containing pLysS and pGAC315 produced the maximum amount of overexpression as compared to transformants harboring pLysE or BL-21(DE3) alone (data not shown). Control cells harboring pET11a did not exhibit overexpression of new proteins (Fig. 3; pET11a, lanes 0, 2, and 3) as compared to cells containing pGAC315 (lanes 2 and 3) which demonstrated overexpression of a 36-kDa protein at 2 and 3 h postinduction with IPTG. This band was not enhanced in extracts of cells harboring pGAC315 prior to IPTG induction (Fig. 3, lane 0). Following the expression of hasC in E. coli, cell extracts were assayed for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity as described under “Experimental Procedures” in order to confirm that hasC coded for UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. In these experiments, BL-21(DE3)(pLysS) harboring the pET11a expression plasmid did not demonstrate UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity before or after induction. Similarly treated BL-21(DE3)(pLysS) harboring pGAC315 demonstrated UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase activity only after IPTG induction (specific activity 0.13 unit/mg of protein). Substitution of UDP-galactose for UDP-glucose in the assays demonstrated no activity in uninduced or IPTG-induced organisms (data not shown). Sequence and homology analyses demonstrated that hasC encoded UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, the enzyme that in the presence of UTP catalyzes the reaction of glucose 1-phosphate to UDP-glucose. UDP-glucose is the substrate for the gene product of hasB, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, responsible for the production of UDP-glucuronic acid in the presence of NAD. Finally, UDP-glucuronic acid is a component of the hyaluronic acid capsule for group A streptococci which is synthesized by the membrane associated enzyme hyaluronate synthase encoded by hasA. All three genes have been shown to be components of the has operon(10Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Crater D.L. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). It has previously been shown by Southern analysis that the three genes that comprise the operon are located on the same 8.4-kb XbaI restriction fragment. In addition, Northern blot analyses demonstrated that hasA, hasB, and hasC are contained within a 4.2-kb mRNA transcript. Sequence data revealed that hasC is located 192 nucleotides downstream of hasB. This is a substantial distance for sequential genes in an operon in streptococci where the distance between hasA and hasB is only 37 nucleotides. Potential transcription initiation sites were observed between hasB and hasC; however, primer extension analyses of the entire 192 nucleotide region using multiple primers did not reveal an initiation site (data not shown) providing further evidence that hasC is a constituent of the has operon. Since hasC is not transcribed from its own promoter, the distance between hasB and hasC may be important for structural requirements or interaction with proteins involved in translation machinery. Our previous Northern analysis data (14Crater D.L. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the presence of a potential rho-independent terminator at the 3-prime end of hasC gene (Fig. 1, bold) provides strong evidence that hasC is the last gene comprising the has operon. Characteristics of a strong terminator include dyad symmetry, an inverted repeat containing 6-8 uracil residues, and a stem-loop rich in G and C nucleotides. The stem of the terminator for hasC is 25 nucleotides in length and contains 6 A-T pairs, the loop consists of 5 nucleotides (CAAAGT), and there are 16 G or C nucleotides (Fig. 4). Although the terminator of hasC complies with all of the requirements for a rho-independent terminator, further experimentation is required to confirm that this potential structure is the transcription termination site of the has operon. To overexpress hasC in E. coli, the pET-T7 expression system was utilized. This system employed the use of various plasmids to enhance the expression of the gene of interest, especially genes that may be toxic to the cell. For overexpression of hasC, transformants harboring pLysS were found to produce maximal amounts of HasC (Fig. 3), as compared to transformants containing pLysE or BL-21(DE3) alone (data not shown). The higher level of lysozyme produced from pLysE has been shown to interfere with the growth rate of the bacteria and may decrease the amount of transcription after IPTG induction. As with the previous expression of hasB (10Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) it was important to use low copy number plasmids under tight transcription control for expression of the gene product in E. coli. The predicted size for HasC was approximately 33.7 kDa which is in good agreement with the product of the T7 overexperssion of hasC in E. coli (36 kDa). Variation in the predicted size from the size demonstrated by SDS-PAGE also was seen with other bacterial UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases. GalU was shown to be 40 kDa (predicted size, 32.9 kDa) (22Hossain S.A. Tanizawa K. Kazuta Y. Fukui T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 115: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 30Weissborn A.C. Liu Q. Rumley M.K. Kennedy E.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 2611-2618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CelA was 30 kDa (predicted size, 30.9 kDa) (31Brede G. Fjaervik E. Valla S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7042-7045Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The size difference between the predicted and the actual size determined by SDS-PAGE could be due to secondary structure of the protein causing the protein to migrate through the gel slower than expected. Also as with the expression analysis of group A streptococcal UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (HasB)(10Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7118-7124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), induction of group A streptococcal UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in E. coli appears to have led to a greater expression of protein (Fig. 3) than enzyme activity. Analysis of crude extracts indicated that enzyme activity versus protein concentration appeared approximately linear (data not shown) and that no NADPH oxidation was demonstrated. One important consideration is that the enzyme is labile and/or inhibited by components of the assay system. Toward this hypothesis it was determined that both imidazole-HCl and Tricine-NaOH buffers greatly inhibited the streptococcal enzyme (data not shown). Both of these buffers have previously been used for other UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase assays(24Joshi J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 89: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Fjaervik E. Frydenlund K. Valla S. Huggirat Y. Benziman M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1991; 77: 325-330Crossref Google Scholar). Finally, the specific activity of various preparations of the streptococcal UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase varied 2-4-fold when expressed in E. coli (data not shown). This did not appear to be due to granule formation since all of the enzyme activity could be retrieved from the cytoplasmic fraction. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase is found in a wide variety of organisms (plant, animals, and bacteria) and provides UDP-glucose for the biosynthetic pathways of many carbohydrates (sucrose, cellulose, and glycogen) as well as hyaluronic acid. The most detailed work on UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase has been done using the cDNA from potato tuber(34Nakano K. Omura Y. Tagaya M. Fukui T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 106: 528-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cDNA has been cloned and the recombinant protein expressed in E. coli(33Katsube T. Kazuta Y. Tanizawa K. Fukui T.

The active site of the enzyme was shown to include 5 key lysine residues, as shown by site-directed mutagenesis and affinity labeling(33Katsube T. Kazuta Y. Tanizawa K. Fukui T.

(Tokyo). 1994; 115: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that prokaryotic UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases are structurally diverse from the eukaryotic enzyme. Although HasC and other prokaryotic UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases do not possess sequence homology with the potato tuber enzyme or other eukaryotic pyrophosphorylases, many contain the lysine residue found to be indespensible for enzyme function (Fig. 2, Lys-367 from potato tuber). However, further structural analysis of the catalytic sites of these enzymes are required in order to confirm whether this lysine is necessary for enzymatic activity in the prokaryote UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases. In summary, our previous Northern analysis data demonstrating a single 4.2-kb transcript (14Crater D.L. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18452-18458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and the observed putative rho-independent terminator at the 3-prime end of hasC would indicate that the has operon is composed of hasA, hasB, and hasC. On going experiments include analysis of regulatory factors that may assist in the control of has operon transcription during exponential phase of growth. Finally, purification of the expressed HasC protein will be required to determine its enzyme kinetics and an analysis of its active site is required for comparison to other prokaryote and plant and animal UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases to better understand the evolutionary differences between these enzymes.

https://openalex.org/W1565402256,"Carbohydrate feeding of animals results in striking increases in hepatic fatty acid synthesis but much of this induction is presumed to be hormone mediated. To clarify the mechanisms responsible for the specific effect of carbohydrate on fatty acid synthesis, the effects of D-glucose on the expression of human fatty acid synthase (FAS) in HepG2 cells cultured in serum-free medium were studied. Northern blots of total RNA from these cells showed a single FAS mRNA band of 9.3 kilobases that was increased 2.7-5.4-fold in the presence of D-glucose. Lactate and citrate but not L-glucose mimicked this effect. Glucose induction of FAS mRNA was time- and concentration-dependent and most of the increase in FAS message was detected within the range of physiologic glucose concentrations. Glucose induction of FAS mRNA, protein synthetic rate, and enzyme activity were similar suggesting that glucose regulates FAS expression at a pretranslational level in this system. Transcription run-off experiments showed that glucose feeding was associated with no change in the FAS transcription initiation rate despite a 5-fold increase in FAS mRNA. FAS mRNA stability as determined by actinomycin D chase was 7-fold greater in the presence of glucose. Differences between FAS mRNA levels in cells grown in the presence versus the absence of glucose were inhibited by cycloheximide but not puromycin, suggesting that glucose regulation of FAS mRNA stability is not dependent on translation. Glucose, at physiologic concentrations and in the absence of hormones, appears to regulate FAS gene expression in HepG2 cells predominantly by mediating FAS mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W1482792095,"Four low M(r) cysteine proteinase inhibitors with different pI values were isolated from bovine thymus using alkaline activation of the gland homogenate, affinity chromatography on carboxymethyl-papain-Sepharose, gel filtration on Sephadex G-50, ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-cellulose column and a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q column, and hydrophobic chromatography on a TSK Phenyl-5 PW column. One of the inhibitors was identified both as the monomeric and dimeric forms of stefin B. Two others, called cysteine proteinase inhibitor-1 and cysteine proteinase inhibitor-2, were N terminally blocked and most likely belong to the stefin family. The complete amino acid sequence of the last inhibitor, namely bovine stefin C, was determined. The inhibitor consisted of 101 amino acids and its M(r) was calculated to be 11,546. It exhibits considerable sequence homology with other inhibitors from the stefin family. It was identified as the first tryptophane-containing stefin and it had a prolonged N terminus. The four inhibitors had similar inhibitory activities on cysteine proteinases. They were fast-acting inhibitors of papain and cathepsin L (kass > or = 1.8 x 10(6) M-1 s-1) and formed very tight complexes with the enzymes (Ki 100 nM)."
https://openalex.org/W1533177616,"Two heme analogs, cobalt- and tin-protoporphyrin (CoPP and SnPP, respectively) have been used to probe the heme-hemopexin interaction, hemopexin receptor binding, and the mechanism of regulation of heme oxygenase (HO) and metallothionein-1 (MT-1) gene expression by hemopexin. Both CoPP and SnPP are HO inhibitors and hemopexin binds SnPP (Morgan, W. T., Alam, J., Deaciuc, V., Muster, P., Tatum, F. M., and Smith, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8226-8231) and CoPP.

https://openalex.org/W1558468675,"We have cloned the BLH1 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae coding for a peptidase with significant homology to rabbit bleomycin hydrolase. Bleomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic used for the treatment of human cancers. The antitumor activity of the drug is limited by its metabolic inactivation caused by bleomycin hydrolase, a member of the cysteine protease family. The open reading frame of BLH1 consists of 1,449 base pairs encoding a 55.4-kDa protein consistent with the molecular mass found in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The consensus sequence within the active site region of cysteine proteases is conserved in the yeast enzyme. Biochemical studies on the purified enzyme confirm its classification as a thiol protease. The nonvacuolar enzyme has a molecular mass of 220 kDa, suggesting a homotetrameric structure. It exhibits an aminopeptidase activity with broad substrate specificity. Biochemical and genetic linkage data give evidence that the BLH1 and the LAP3 (Trumbly, R. J., and Bradley, G. (1983) J. Bacteriol. 156, 36-48) encoded aminopeptidases are identical. Deletion of the BLH1 gene is not lethal under normal growth conditions. However, blh1 mutants show hypersensitivity to bleomycin, indicating that bleomycin hydrolase is able to inactivate bleomycin in vivo and to protect cells from bleomycin-induced toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1485988308,"Abstract Several mutant lymphoma lines are unable to add glycophosphatidylinositol membrane anchors to proteins. Some of them accumulate abnormal glycolipids which can be labeled by tritiated myo-inositol, mannose, or ethanolamine and which are not present in the corresponding parental cell lines. The [3H]myo-inositol-labeled abnormal lipids were isolated and characterized using hydrofluoric acid dephosphorylation, nitrous acid deamination, acetolysis, and exoglycosidase treatments alone or in combination. This partial characterization suggests that the class F mutant EL-4-f contains 3 abnormal glycolipids containing 3, 2, or 1 mannose residues, the headgroups of which are Man alpha 1,2Man alpha 1,6(X-->)Man alpha-GlcN-acylinositol, Man alpha 1,6(X-->)Man alpha-GlcN-inositol, and (X-->)Man alpha-GlcN-acylinositol where X represents a charged, hydrofluoric acid-sensitive substituent. A fourth, minor abnormal lipid with a Man alpha 1,6(X-->)Man alpha-GlcN-inositol headgroup but a different lipid moiety is also found. The substituent X is likely to consist of phosphoethanolamine since hydrofluoric acid releases [3H]ethanolamine from the [3H]ethanolamine-labeled version of these lipids. Pulse-chase experiments indicate that the abnormal glycophosphatidylinositols of class F mutants are very long-lived. The class B mutant S1A-b has previously been shown to contain an abnormal Man alpha 1,6(phosphoethanolamine-->)Man alpha-GlcN-acylinositol-P-lipid intermediate. Here we show that S1A-b also accumulates a more polar but less abundant lipid which has the identical headgroup structure but lacks the acyl group on the inositol residue. The class E mutant BW5147-e accumulates a hydrophobic glycolipid with the headgroup structure GlcN-acylinositol. All the abnormal glycolipids except those of EL-4-f are heterogeneous with regard to their lipid moiety since base-resistant as well as base-sensitive lipids are present. This suggests that the base-resistant alkylglycerols typical of mammalian anchors can get integrated into anchors at early stages of glycophosphatidylinositol formation."
https://openalex.org/W1570071329,"The effects of aluminum fluoride and beryllium fluoride on smooth muscle myosin and its subfragments were studied. Mg(2+)-ATPase activity was inhibited in the presence of aluminum fluoride (beryllium fluoride). [3H]ADP bound to heavy meromyosin (HMM) in the presence of aluminum fluoride (beryllium fluoride) and was not dissociated after 3 days of dialysis demonstrating that [3H]ADP was trapped in HMM. These results suggest the formation of a stable HMM-ADP-fluoroaluminate (fluoroberyllate) complex. The intrinsic tryptophane fluorescence intensity was increased in the presence of ADP and aluminum fluoride (beryllium fluoride). Acto-S1 was dissociated upon the formation of S1-ADP-fluoroberyllate and actin destabilized S1-ADP-fluoroberyllate complex, while S1-ADP-fluoroaluminate failed to bind to actin. Furthermore, when S1 formed the complex with actin, nucleotide trapping did not occur in the presence of fluoraluminate. These results indicated that the myosin-ADP-fluoroberyllate complex resembles a weak binding state while myosin-ADP-fluoroaluminate complex is a distinct conformation although the binding to actin was also weak. The structure of the ternary complex was investigated using 19F NMR. The 19F NMR spectrum of the S1-ADP-fluoroaluminate complex showed a peak at -66.7 ppm which is due to the binding of fluoraluminate to S1. The peak was not observed when 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate was substituted for ADP suggesting that aluminum fluoride plays a role as a phosphate analogue. The stoichiometry of the bound fluoride was determined to be 3.8 mol/mol S1 suggesting that the bound species is AlF-4."
https://openalex.org/W1596294893,"Abstract Monolayers of fura-2-loaded A7r5 cells, a cell line derived from rat embryonic aorta, generated spontaneous Ca2+ spikes that were synchronized within the cell population. These Ca2+ spikes were abolished by removal of extracellular Ca2+ or addition of nimodipine (50 nM), and their frequency was increased by depolarization with high K+ or by treatment with BAYK 8644 (1 microM), indicating that Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels is required for Ca2+ spiking. Several lines of evidence indicate that mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores is not necessary for this Ca2+ spiking. 1) Ryanodine (0.1-50 microM) neither stimulated Ca2+ mobilization nor affected Ca2+ spiking; 2) the complex effects of caffeine were mimicked by theophylline, 8-bromo-cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (8-bromo-cAMP), and forskolin, suggesting that the caffeine effects may be mediated by cAMP and not by ryanodine receptors; 3) prolonged incubation with thapsigargin (50 nM), which depletes intracellular Ca2+ stores, did not affect the frequency of Ca2+ spiking; 4) Ba2+ or Sr2+ could substitute for Ca2+ in the spike-generating mechanism even when intracellular stores were depleted of Ca2+. Under conditions where the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) contained Ca2+, Ba2+ spikes did not cause Ca2+ mobilization. The mechanisms involved in generating spontaneous Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells are therefore likely to reside in the sarcolemma and to operate independently of SR Ca2+ uptake and release."
https://openalex.org/W1511980067,"The general properties of phosphatidylserine synthesis and translocation to the inner mitochondrial membrane which occur in both intact and permeabilized cells are now shown to occur in cells that are disrupted by shearing. In disrupted cells the synthesis of phosphatidylserine requires ATP and is blocked by preventing Ca2+ sequestration. The translocation of nascent phosphatidylserine to the mitochondria also requires ATP in disrupted cells. Using disrupted cells it is possible to test whether the translocation of nascent phosphatidylserine to the mitochondria is restricted to autologous mitochondrial acceptors or is possible with heterologous mitochondrial acceptors. To examine the nature of the transport process, a donor and acceptor population of cells were prepared. The donor cells were poisoned with hydroxylamine which irreversibly inactivates phosphatidylserine decarboxylase and will prevent the conversion of nascent phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine. The acceptor cells were not treated with hydroxylamine so that any phosphatidylserine generated in the donor cell that reached the inner mitochondrial membrane of the acceptor cells would be decarboxylated to form phosphatidylethanolamine. Disrupted donor cells were pulse labeled with [3H]serine for 40 min to permit the synthesis of [3H] phosphatidylserine, and then further incorporation of radiolabel was arrested by chelating Ca2+. When the prelabeled disrupted donor cells were mixed with disrupted acceptor cells the latter failed to decarboxylate the nascent phosphatidylserine. In control experiments the addition of hydroxylamine-poisoned cells did not alter the transfer of nascent phosphatidylserine to autologous mitochondria present in unpoisoned cells. These results indicate that the ATP-dependent translocation of phosphatidylserine to the mitochondria is a process that is restricted to the autologous organelle."
https://openalex.org/W1513709029,"Abstract Incubation of (3Z)-nonenal (NON) with the 269,000-g particle fraction of seed homogenate of the broad bean (Vicia faba L.) afforded (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) as the principal product. One pathway of HNE formation consisted of initial oxygenation of NON into (2E)-4-hydroperoxy-2-nonenal (HPNE) by a novel (3Z)-alkenal oxygenase activity, followed by conversion of HPNE into HNE by a previously recognized hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. The hydroperoxide intermediate was detected in coincubations of NON and oleic acid, in which experiments the HPNE generated from NON supported epoxygenase-catalyzed epoxidation of oleic acid into 9,10-epoxystearic acid. Furthermore, by using an enzyme preparation in which the epoxygenase had been inactivated by pretreatment with hydrogen peroxide it was possible to isolate and characterize racemic (4R,4S) HPNE following incubation of NON. Although the (3Z)-alkenal oxygenase resembled a lipoxygenase in its action, it was not inhibited by the lipoxygenase inhibitors, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid. In a second pathway, HNE was produced by rearrangement of 3,4-epoxynonenal, which was in turn formed from NON by a reaction catalyzed by hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. Support for this pathway came from experiments in which 18O-labeled HNE was isolated following coincubation of NON and 13-18O-labeled linoleic acid 13-hydroperoxide. The existence of 3,4-epoxynonenal as a transient intermediate in HNE biosynthesis was further demonstrated by the isolation of 3,4-epoxynonenal (61% (4R)-configuration) as a trapping product in short time incubations interrupted by addition of sodium borohydride. The two pathways established for biosynthesis of HNE involved the hydroperoxide-reducing and the olefin-epoxidizing activities of hydroperoxide-dependent epoxygenase. In the absence of extraneous olefins and hydroperoxides the two pathways would be tightly coupled and follow the stoichiometry: 2NON + 1O2-->2HNE. It was also shown that the V. faba particle fraction catalyzed oxygenation of (3Z)-hexenal into (2E)-4-hydroxy-2-hexenal."
https://openalex.org/W1485213895,"Subunit A is thought to be the main component of the catalytic site of the vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase. Screening of a cDNA library made from human osteoclastoma tumor tissue revealed the presence of two isoforms of subunit A. HO68 is a cDNA of 3.1 kilobase pairs, corresponding to a mRNA of approximately 3.4 kilobases in osteoclastoma only, encoding a protein of 615 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 68177 Da. A second subtype, VA68, corresponding to a mRNA of approximately 4.8 kilobases was present in all tissues analyzed, and codes for a predicted protein of 617 residues and theoretical molecular mass of 68264 Da. These clones share homology with previously published subunit A sequences, and this, together with the tissue distribution of the mRNA, suggests there are ubiquitous (VA68-type) and tissue-specific (HO68-type) isoforms. HO68 shows the closest sequence homology (95% at the amino acid level) to subunit A of a proton-secreting vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase located in the apical membrane of midgut goblet cells of tobacco hornworm larva (Manduca sexta). We propose that HO68 could correspond to an isoform of subunit A specific for a vacuolar-type H(+)-ATPase located in the osteoclast plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1554027724,"Changes in the cellular mass and the cellular concentration of the highly phosphorylated inositol derivatives inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5) and inositol hexakisphosphate (InsP6) were observed during a complete cell cycle of proliferating rat thymocytes. Inositol polyphosphates were determined by a recently developed anion-exchange HPLC/post-column complexometric dye system (Mayr, G. W. (1988) Biochem. J. 254, 585-591), and data were expressed as mass amounts per cell number or as absolute intracellular concentrations based on cell volume determinations by the cell analyzer system CASY 1. After a very early transient rise in both Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 at the beginning of the cell cycle, a decrease of the intracellular concentration of both compounds occurred which then remained on a low level between 24 and 48 h. Between 48 and 72 h the cells divided resulting in a decrease of the cell volume by a factor of approximately 2. During this phase a pronounced increase of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 was observed. These increases were already seen when the data were expressed as mass per cell number, but were even enhanced when expressed as absolute intracellular concentrations. In conclusion, we present as a novel finding long term changes in the intracellular concentrations of Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 and InsP6 in proliferating thymocytes. This may indicate a role for these compounds during cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W1554302589,"Thrombospondin, a glycoprotein of three identical disulfide-bonded subunits, is a constituent of platelet alpha-granules and a variety of normal and transformed cells and binds to cell surfaces and becomes incorporated into extracellular matrix. It has been implicated in processes such as wound healing and tumor growth and metastasis. In addition, thrombospondin was shown recently to be an inhibitor of the fibrinolytic enzyme, plasmin. In the cause of studying the effects of thrombospondin on other serine proteinases, we found that thrombospondin binds neutrophil elastase in an active-site-dependent manner and competitively inhibits the activity of the enzyme. In a competitive binding assay, neutrophil elastase bound to thrombospondin with a dissociation constant of 17 +/- 7 nM, expressed per mole of thrombospondin trimer, or 52 +/- 20 nM, expressed per mole of thrombospondin subunit. In kinetic studies of the inhibition of the amidolytic activity of neutrophil elastase by thrombospondin, 2.7 +/- 0.3 mol of elastase interacted with 1 mol of thrombospondin trimer with a site-binding constant of 57 +/- 13 nM. Lower limits for the on rate constant of 5 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 and off rate constant of 0.27 s-1 were established. Affinity of binding of neutrophil elastase to thrombospondin was sensitive to ionic strength and calcium ions. Thrombospondin was cleaved by neutrophil elastase, but the site(s) of the limited cleavage are independent of the competitive inhibition of elastase activity by thrombospondin. Neutrophil elastase inactivated with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride did not compete with active elastase for binding to thrombospondin, implying that a functional active site is important for the interaction of elastase with thrombospondin. Thrombospondin protected fibronectin from cleavage by neutrophil elastase. In summary, the binding of neutrophil elastase to thrombospondin is tight, reversible, and close enough to the active site of elastase to exclude small synthetic tripeptidyl p-nitroanilide substrates and macromolecular protein substrates. Two potential reactive centers that may be involved in binding elastase have been identified in the calcium-binding type 3 domains of thrombospondin. Neutrophil elastase is the enzyme primarily responsible for degrading and solubilizing connective tissue during inflammatory processes. These findings suggest a previously unsuspected mechanism for regulation of elastase activity at inflammatory sites."
https://openalex.org/W1558819606,"Subunit A of the vacuolar proton pump appears to be responsible for the ATP hydrolysis which is coupled to the pumping of protons into a variety of intracellular acid compartments, including the fungal vacuole. We report here the cloning and sequence determination of the gene encoding subunit A from Candida tropicalis. Southern blot hybridization analysis indicates that there is a single gene which encodes this protein. The gene contains a single intron at the extreme 5'-end of the coding region. The gene is predicted to encode a polypeptide of 1088 residues with a calculated molecular mass of 119,019 daltons, yet the mature polypeptide appears to be approximately 67 kDa, indicating that this protein probably undergoes the same sort of processing that is evidenced in the homologous protein from Saccharomyces cerevisiae in which an approximately 50-kDa polypeptide (the spacer) is spliced out of the mature protein. The Candida gene, with and without this middle portion, has been expressed in S. cerevisiae and found to restore a Saccharomyces subunit A deletion mutant (tfp1-delta 8) to apparently wild-type growth at pH 7.6, and normal vacuolar acidification. The peptide sequence of the two predicted mature ends is very similar to the sequences of the analogous proteins from Daucus carota, S. cerevisiae, and Neurospora crassa (60.5, 87.4, and 72.9% identity, respectively), but the middle portion bears only very limited homology with the Saccharomyces protein sequence. Processing of the gene product occurs in S. cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, and in rabbit reticulocyte-mediated in vitro translation, indicating that the excision is probably autocatalytic. The limited sequence identity seen between the Saccharomyces and Candida spacer domains may considerably narrow the functionally important regions responsible for the excision event."
https://openalex.org/W6280262,"A procedure has been established for the isolation of intact and import-competent glyoxysomes from the cotyledons of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seedlings. Radiolabeled isocitrate lyase (a glyoxysomal matrix protein) was produced by in vitro transcription of the castor bean cDNA and translation of the RNA in a wheat germ lysate. The heterologous isocitrate lyase was imported into isolated sunflower glyoxysomes and protease-protected. Dihydrofolate reductase, a cytoplasmic protein, neither bound to nor imported into the glyoxysomes. Import of isocitrate lyase was not observed when the glyoxysome fraction was replaced by a mitochondrial fraction. The import of isocitrate lyase into glyoxysomes was temperature- and ATP-dependent. Progressive carboxyl-terminal truncations of the isocitrate lyase gene were transcribed and translated to yield polypeptides with the same amino terminus but lacking varying amounts of the carboxyl terminus. All these polypeptides imported with the same characteristics as the full-length protein, suggesting that targeting information must be present within the first 168 amino acids, and, unlike some other peroxisomal proteins, the carboxyl terminus is dispensable for targeting and import."
https://openalex.org/W1590500446,"Band shift and UV cross-linking assays were used to analyze the major single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding activity in lysates of primate and rodent cells. The ssDNA binding activity behaved chromatographically similar to that of replication protein A (RP-A), a multisubunit protein containing three polypeptides of molecular mass 70, 34, and 14 kDa. A 70-kDa protein was found to harbor the ssDNA binding activity when UV cross-linked to long ssDNA or to oligonucleotide probes. Monoclonal antibodies against the 70- and the 34-kDa subunits produced super-gel-shift patterns, demonstrating that the reactive protein is indeed RP-A and that the retarded native binding complex included both subunits. RP-A displayed oligonucleotide-specific binding dependent on oligomer length. Increasing oligonucleotide length led to the formation of slow migrating complexes harboring multiple RP-A molecules, suggesting that an interval of about 20-30 bases is required for the binding of RP-A molecules. While similar binding activity was detected in cell extracts derived from proliferating and quiescent cells, a sharp decline in ssDNA binding activity was observed in the SV40-transformed Chinese hamster cell line 631 following UV irradiation. The nature of this decrease in activity and its possible effect on DNA replication is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1599884038,"rab9 is a ras-like GTPase which has been implicated in the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors between late endosomes and the trans Golgi network. We have expressed recombinant rab9 in Escherichia coli, purified the protein to homogeneity, and initiated a biochemical analysis of this enzyme. rab9 hydrolyzed GTP with a rate constant of 0.0052 min-1 at 37 degrees C. rab7, a highly homologous endosomal GTPase, hydrolyzed GTP with a rate constant of 0.0023 min-1 at 37 degrees C. At this temperature, GDP and GTP each dissociated from rab9 with first-order rate constants of 0.017 min-1. GDP and GTP dissociated from rab7 at 37 degrees C with first-order rate constants of 0.0054 and 0.0024 min-1, respectively. We modified the procedure of John et al. (John, J., Sohmen, R., Feuerstein, J., Linke, R., Wittinghofer, A., and Goody, R. (1990) Biochemistry 29, 6058-6065) for the preparation of nucleotide-free ras such that the procedure can now be applied to 1000-fold smaller quantities of protein. Using this method, we prepared microgram quantities of nucleotide-free rab9 in a form which is heat-stable, free of exogenous nucleotide-degrading enzymes and which can be stored at -80 degrees C. At 37 degrees C for GDP and GTP, the second-order rate constants for association with nucleotide-free rab9 were 1.7 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 and 1.2 x 10(5) M-1 s-1, respectively, and equilibrium binding constants were 170 pM and 2.4 nM, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1504073109,"Ferritin is the major intracellular iron-storage protein in eucaryotic cells and plays a prominent role in maintaining intracellular iron homeostasis. We observed that transfection of NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts with the adenovirus E1A oncogene specifically repressed the mRNA for one of the subunits of ferritin, ferritin H. This occurred in the absence of any effect of E1A on the mRNA for the L subunit of ferritin. The repression of ferritin H was not a general feature of oncogene expression since transfection of NIH-3T3 cells with H-ras did not affect ferritin composition. Deletion of the conserved regions of E1A responsible for immortalization and transcriptional repression impaired the ability of E1A to repress ferritin H. Immunoprecipitation of ferritin in E1A transfectants demonstrated that the decrease in the ferritin H/L ratio observed at the mRNA level was also exhibited at the protein level. The E1A-dependent inhibition of ferritin H was also observed in a chimeric gene containing the ferritin H promoter ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, but was not observed in control genes in which chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was dependent on promoters derived from SV40 or the interleukin-3 gene. This suggests that E1A may repress ferritin H at the transcriptional level. These results demonstrate that the adenovirus E1A oncogene specifically modulates ferritin H expression. They also suggest that alterations in cellular iron metabolism may be among the diverse array of cellular responses induced by E1A."
https://openalex.org/W1591163080,"A cDNA encoding a naturally occurring variant of cytochrome P450 (P450) 2C3 that catalyzes the 6 beta- and 16 alpha-hydroxylation of progesterone exhibits six differences of nucleotide sequence leading to five amino acid substitutions from that encoding 2C3, a progesterone 16 alpha-hydroxylase that does not catalyze 6 beta-hydroxylation. Analysis of chimeric and mutant enzymes indicates that a Ser/Thr difference at position 364 underlies the difference between the two enzymes in 6 beta-hydroxylase activity as well as sensitivity to the inhibitor, 16 alpha-methylprogesterone. In addition, an Ile/Met difference at position 178 influences the apparent Km for progesterone. The two mutations, S364T and 1178M, together convert 2C3 to a form that exhibits kinetic properties which are similar to the 2C3v enzyme, and the reciprocal mutations in 2C3v convert it to an enzyme that resembles 2C3. Interestingly, position 364 of 2C3 maps to a substrate-contacting domain suggested by models for mammalian P450 enzymes based on the structure of P450cam. Ile178 is highly conserved among mammalian microsomal P450s with the exception of CYP4A and CYP19 enzymes which exhibit a Met at this alignment position."
https://openalex.org/W1578008908,"Abstract Bordetella avium is the etiological agent of an upper respiratory disease in birds which, symptomatically and pathologically, resembles bordetellosis in humans. Studies of the virulence of this organism revealed a novel cytotoxic protein, designated osteotoxin, that was lethal for MC3T3-E1 osteogenic cells, fetal bovine trabecular cells, UMR106-01(BSP) rat osteosarcoma cells, and embryonic bovine tracheal cells. The osteotoxin lacked dermonecrotic toxin activity, exhibited no cross-reactivity with antibody against B. avium dermonecrotic toxin, and was non-proteolytic. Osteotoxin (M(r) approximately 80,000 by gel filtration, pI 5.4) was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from B. avium 197. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric analyses showed that the native protein was a homodimer and that each of the non-covalently linked subunits (M(r) approximately 41,000) contained one molecule of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate. Microsequencing of the first 32 amino acids from the NH2 terminus allowed the synthesis of two oligonucleotide probes, which, together with polyclonal antibody to the purified protein, facilitated cloning, sequencing, and expression of the osteotoxin gene product in Escherichia coli. The open reading frame encodes a polypeptide of 396 amino acid residues (M(r) = 42,606, calculated pI 5.9), whose sequence exhibits approximately 38% identity (approximately 60% similarity) to pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent beta-cystathionase(s) from E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, and rat liver. The characteristic motif, TKYXXGHSD, associated with binding the cofactor in these enzymes is also present in osteotoxin. Physicochemical and enzymatic analyses established the coidentity of osteotoxin with beta-cystathionase. The region upstream of the beta-cystathionase (metC) gene in B. avium 197 lacked regulatory sequences (Met boxes) described for metC in enteric species, and enzyme production was not repressed by methionine. Incubation of MC3T3-E1 osteogenic cells in medium containing L-[35S]cystine and purified beta-cystathionase resulted in 35S-labeling of the enzyme and at least one major MC3T3-E1 cell protein (M(r) approximately 50,000). cytotoxicity can be attributed to: 1) beta-cystathionase-catalyzed cleavage of L-cystine in the medium and formation of reactive sulfane-containing derivative(s), and 2) transfer of sulfane sulfur to metabolically sensitive or structurally important proteins in the osteogenic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1493303449,"The cDNA sequence encoding precursor forms of human cathepsin E (CE), an intracellular aspartic proteinase, was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using an SV40 promotor-driven expression vector. By immunoelectron microscopic studies using an anti-human CE antibody and by Percoll density gradient fractionation, the expressed CE was found to be in two different intracellular fractions; the cytosolic compartment and the vacuolar system. The CEs in both the cytosolic and the vacuolar fractions were highly purified by a simple method involving Percoll density gradient fractionation, chromatography on concanavalin A-Sepharose, Mono Q, and TSK-GelG2000SW, and termed s-CE and v-CE, respectively. The v-CE was further separated into a major (v-CE1) and a minor (v-CE2) form by Mono Q chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting revealed that the s-CE and v-CE1 consists of two polypeptides of 90 and 84 kDa, whereas v-CE2 is composed of 84- and 82-kDa polypeptides. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analyses showed that the 90- and 84-kDa proteins from both s-CE and v-CE started with Ser3 and Lys30 of the sequence of human gastric CE predicted from its cDNA sequence, respectively, and that the NH2 terminus of the 82-kDa protein of v-CE2 is the Ile37. Upon acid treatment at pH 3.5 and 37 degrees C for 5 min, the 90- and 84-kDa forms are rapidly converted to the 82-kDa form, indicating that the 90-, 84- and 82-kDa proteins are the pro-CE, the intermediate form, and the mature CE, respectively. All the forms of CE are N-glycosylated with high-mannose-type oligosaccharides. The catalytic properties of s-CE and v-CE are comparable to those of natural human CE. These results suggest that the recombinant CE is initially synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes as a N-glycosylated preproenzyme and that, after cleavage of the signal segment, the 90-kDa proenzyme is proteolytically processed to the intermediate (84 kDa) and mature (82 kDa) forms by the transport system."
https://openalex.org/W1690273738,"Rod photoreceptor outer segments are elaborated at approximately 6 months gestation in the cow coinciding with a dramatic increase in mRNAs encoding many visual transduction and associated proteins. Nuclear run-on determination of relative transcription rates demonstrates that gene expression follows three distinct patterns. Opsin, S-antigen, and transducin are all minimally detectable at 5.2 months gestation and increase throughout development. Only opsin demonstrates an additional sharp increase in transcriptional activity which resembles a positive gene-specific enhancer that is first effective between 6.3 and 7.4 months gestation. In contrast, interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein (IRBP) transcription is already at 43% of its adult level at 5.2 months gestation. To further understand these differences, the relative contributions of initiation and elongation to nuclear run-on signals were examined using either Sarkosyl or ammonium sulfate. Transcriptional rates for S-antigen and transducin were not affected, however, opsin was reduced approximately 4-fold and IRBP was increased approximately 2-fold. Opsin is therefore likely to be initiated de novo during the run-on reaction and responds to a gene-specific positive regulator. The increase in IRBP transcription rate suggests the removal of an elongation inhibitory factor and supports the idea that a negative regulatory element may be involved in controlling IRBP expression."
https://openalex.org/W1604450939,"A protein kinase C homologue of Schizosaccharomyces pombe, pkc1+, was isolated from a genomic library by screening with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PKC1 probe. From its primary sequence and biochemical properties, we conclude that S. pombe pkc1+ encodes a phospholipid-activated Ca(2+)-independent protein kinase, homologous to the delta/epsilon classes of mammalian protein kinase C. Gene disruption experiments show that pkc1+ is not essential for cell viability; however, overexpression of the protein leads to an abnormal cell morphology and a block in cell separation following mitosis suggestive of a role in cell division. In vitro phosphorylation experiments reveal several potential pkc1+ substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1523855184,"The homology A (glycine-rich or P-loop) consensus sequence occurs in the catalytic sites of F1F0 ATP synthase enzymes. The conserved lysine of this motif is beta-subunit Lys-155 in Escherichia coli F1. The role of this lysine in binding and catalysis at the high affinity ATP binding site was studied with the mutants beta K155Q and beta K155E by measuring the rates of ATP binding/release, ATP hydrolysis/synthesis, and Pi release as a function of pH varied from 5.5 to 9.5. In wild type, protonated beta Lys-155 appears to contribute significantly to high affinity binding of ATP, probably through hydrogen bonding to the gamma-phosphate. ATP hydrolysis and synthesis were impaired strongly in the mutants, and the reaction equilibrium constant, which was pH-independent in wild type, was highly pH-dependent in beta K155Q and beta K155E. Studies of steady-state ATPase turnover showed that positive catalytic cooperativity was virtually absent and the pH-dependent component of positive catalytic cooperativity was abolished or reversed in the mutants. The data demonstrate that residue beta K155 is a critical catalytic residue in F1 ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1492349213,"The integrin alpha 4 beta 1 (VLA-4) is a versatile cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion receptor. The alpha 4 subunit can be expressed on the cell surface in two forms: an intact form (alpha 4/150) and a cleaved form (alpha 4/80,70). Here we have characterized a third form of alpha 4, called alpha 4/180. Although alpha 4/180 (M(r) 180, nonreduced) is different in size than alpha 4/150 (M(r) 150, nonreduced), these two forms are clearly related, as they (i) shared the same amino-terminal sequence, (ii) were both recognized in Western blots by an anti-alpha 4 COOH-terminal antiserum, (iii) migrated with the same apparent size and charge when reduced, and (iv) were both immunoprecipitated using anti-VLA-4 reagents. In pulse-chase experiments, precursors to both forms appeared simultaneously and matured at the same rate, indicating that one is most likely not the biosynthetic precursor of the other. Although reduction of alpha 4/180 to yield alpha 4/150 suggested the release of a cysteine-linked 30-kDa fragment, seven different biochemical techniques failed to identify such a fragment. Also, alpha 4/180 was converted to alpha 4/150 by incubation at pH 11, by treatment with EDTA at 56 degrees C, or by heating in the presence of elevated SDS levels. Together our findings suggest that alpha 4/180 and alpha 4/150 represent different conformations of the same alpha 4 polypeptide, with the former having anomalous slower migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This unusual biochemical feature of alpha 4 is not shared by other beta 1-associated integrin alpha subunits and suggests that VLA-4 has unique structural properties."
https://openalex.org/W1608704792,"Abstract Fluorescence resonance energy transfer was measured between probes attached to Troponin-I and actin in the reconstituted skeletal muscle thin filament. Cys-133 on TnI was labeled with 4-acetamido-4'-maleimidylstilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid, and Lys-61 on actin was labeled with fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate. A large difference in the efficiency of resonance energy transfer was observed between the presence (0.55) and absence (0.76) of Ca2+, which corresponds to the change in the distance of 0.53 nm and is in good accordance with a previous report (Miki, M. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 187, 155-162). The fluorescence titration curve of this reconstituted thin filament was measured versus free Ca2+ concentration under physiological conditions in the presence of 8 mM MgCl2. The transfer efficiency changed sharply between pCa 6.9 and 5.75, with a midpoint at pCa 6.25, suggesting that a conformational change of thin filaments occurs with a highly cooperative mode. The time course of this conformational change was followed by measuring the fluorescence intensity change (energy transfer efficiency change) of the labeled reconstituted thin filament after rapid decrease or increase of free Ca2+ concentration with a stopped-flow fluorometer. When the free Ca2+ concentration was increased in the presence of 5 mM MgCl2, the fluorescence intensity increased (the transfer efficiency decreased) with a rate constant of 530 +/- 170 s-1 at 20 degrees C. On the other hand, when the free Ca2+ concentration was decreased, the fluorescence intensity decreased with a rate constant of 43 +/- 5 s-1. The results indicate that the conformational change observed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer corresponds well to the regulation mechanism by troponin-tropomyosin on the reconstituted skeletal muscle thin filament."
https://openalex.org/W1512237526,"Rat p70s6k and p85s6k have been expressed in baculovirus recombinants propagated in Sf9 insect cells. Surprisingly, both recombinant isoforms were active without coinfection of other kinases which lie upstream in the signaling pathway. Treatment of either recombinant form with phosphatase 2A leads to immediate inactivation in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. Further studies show that the same four major Ser/Thr-Pro sites associated with p70s6k activation following mitogenic stimulation in vivo are also the four major sites phosphorylated in both the p70s6k and p85s6k during the infection process. It is proposed that the production of phosphorylated and activated recombinant p70s6k and p85s6k is due to activation of a host cell signaling pathway which is triggered by viral infection. In support of this hypothesis, wild-type virus-, but not mock-infected cells, exhibit the multiple phosphorylation of a ribosomal protein which migrates similar to ribosomal protein S6 on two-dimensional-polyacrylamide gels and extracts from these same cells contain elevated levels of S6 kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1557859411,"Mutation of the alpha subunit of the Escherichia coli F1-ATPase to convert Arg-376 to a Cys (alpha R376C) lowers multisite ATPase activity 400-1,000-fold while affecting unisite catalysis only around 6-fold, suggesting that the mutation is in a region important for transmission of conformational changes between catalytic sites (Soga, S., Noumi, T., Takeyama, M., Maeda, M., and Futai, M. (1989) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 268, 643-648; this study). To learn more of the structural features of the segment of the alpha subunit around Arg-376, mutant enzyme with a Cys at this position was modified with several maleimides. N-[14C]Ethylmaleimide reacted rapidly with this Cys in one of the three alpha subunits/F1 (2,500 M-1 s-1); more slowly with a second alpha subunit (390 M-1 s-1); and the same Cys in the third copy of the alpha subunit was completely unreactive to the reagent, indicating asymmetry of alpha subunits in the ECF1 complex. The photoactivatable cross-linker N-(4-azido-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorobenzyl)-3-maleimidopropionamide++ +, when reacted via its maleimide to alpha Cys-376 of the mutant, covalently linked alpha to beta subunits upon photolysis, indicating that Cys-376 of alpha is close to an interface between the alpha and beta subunits. The EDTA-induced exchangeable noncatalytic site could be filled by TNP-ATP in both wild type and alpha R376C mutant ECF1. Occupancy of this site in the alpha R376C mutant altered the rate of reaction of the second-fastest reacting Cys-376 from 390 M-1 s-1 to below 130 M-1 s-1, suggesting that the two sites are on the same alpha subunit. TNP-ATP in the EDTA-induced exchangeable noncatalytic site was quenched by reacting Cys-376 with 4-maleimido-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N(oxyl), indicating that the region around Cys-376, which is involved in transmission of conformational changes between alpha and beta, and noncatalytic sites are maximally 10-12 A from each other."
https://openalex.org/W1562429746,"Taurocholate efflux was studied in Xenopus laevis oocytes and is consistent with a carrier-mediated process. This carrier can be competitively inhibited and trans stimulated by glycocholate. Transport is also trans stimulated by taurochenodeoxycholate and S-hexylglutathione, but not taurolithocholate or daunomycin, reflecting a range of specificity including substrates of both the hepatic canalicular bile acid transporter and the multispecific organic anion transporter. In addition, ATP added to the outside of the oocyte results in an increase in the maximal velocity of this transport process. The physiologic function of this endogenous carrier is not known, but it may act as a generalized system for the efflux of potentially toxic organic anions."
https://openalex.org/W1541367304,"The cDNA of rat amidophosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.14, ATase), which is the supposed regulatory allosteric enzyme of de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, has been cloned by polymerase chain reaction. The predicted open reading frame encodes a protein of 517 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 57,436 including a supposed 11-amino acid propeptide. The 16 amino acid residues next to the propeptide were identical to the N-terminal amino acid microsequence of a purified rat liver ATase, which is consistent with the cleavage of the propeptide from the proenzyme in rat liver. The derived amino acid sequence is the first sequence reported for a mammalian ATase and it exhibits 81, 41, 36, and 31% identity with the sequences of chicken, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATases, respectively. The molecular weight (M(r)) of 57,436 suggests a tetrameric structure of native ATase with a M(r) of 240,000-248,000. Southern blot analysis suggested that the ATase gene exists as a single copy in the rat genome. Northern blot analysis revealed that ATase is expressed at a high level in brain, heart, liver, and stomach. The ATase mRNA in brain, heart, and stomach was 3.5 kilobases (kb) and in liver the 3.5-kb band was observed as well as an additional band of 4.2 kb. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that ATase is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined. Comparison with chicken ATase showed that 2 cysteine residues for an iron-sulfur cluster were conserved. Three conserved and two non-conserved consensus phosphorylation sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase were found."
https://openalex.org/W1531677604,"The kinetics of formation and dissociation of heparin-resistant transcription initiation complexes between Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and the rrnB P1 and P2 promoters from Bacillus subtilis were investigated using a gel retardation assay. The results suggest that the formation of polymerase-promoter complexes proceeds by a three-step reaction mechanism. The bimolecular collision between free RNA polymerase and the promoter creates a heparin-sensitive complex, which then isomerizes to an initial, and then a subsequent, heparin-resistant complex. We propose that a sequential mechanism best describes the bimolecular collision and that the forward rate constants predominate in the overall rate of heparin-resistant complex formation. At 35 degrees C, the association of polymerase with P1 and P2 was very rapid (ka = 1.5 - 2.1 x 10(8) M-1 s-1; kf > or = 0.56 s-1). Direct information on the formation of the closed and intermediate transcription complexes and indirect information on the formation of open complexes suggest that guanosine tetraphosphate did not differentially affect any step between growth rate-regulated and non-growth rate-regulated rRNA promoters by more than 2-fold."
https://openalex.org/W1607044669,"Ribonucleotide reductase has been suggested as a rate-limiting enzyme in DNA synthesis, partly because activities of the enzyme in cell-free preparations are low relative to rates needed to sustain DNA replication at observed rates. Vaccinia virus, with a large duplex DNA genome, encodes both subunits of a specific ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase. In this report, we describe quantitative analysis of ribonucleotide reductase protein levels and DNA accumulation in vaccinia virus-infected cell extracts, to correlate the supply of deoxyribonucleotides with the demand for these precursors in viral DNA synthesis. To do this, we generated polyclonal antisera to TrpE fusion proteins constructed from the carboxyl termini of both subunits of viral ribonucleotide reductase. We used S1 nuclease and immunoprecipitation analysis to determine the transcriptional and translational kinetics of vaccinia virus ribonucleotide reductase expression. Enzyme activity and ribonucleotide reductase protein stability were also assayed during the time course of viral infection. Enzyme-linked immunoassays were used to quantitate protein levels, and filter hybridizations were used to measure the accumulation of viral DNA. We show that ribonucleotide reductase activity in vaccinia virus-infected cells is severalfold higher than needed to provide deoxyribonucleotides at rates commensurate with DNA synthesis. Thus, while the enzyme is important as catalyst for the first committed reaction in DNA replication, it is not rate-limiting for this process."
https://openalex.org/W1542658014,This work characterizes a 250-base pair (bp) fragment of the mouse carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) gene as an efficient but not cell-specific promoter. This fragment contains multiple consensus cis regulatory regions that interact in a complex fashion to regulate transcriptional activity from the promoter. Truncated fragments of the 250-bp promoter retain transcriptional activity. The 90-bp 5' GC-rich portion of the promoter can direct transcription independently from the consensus TATA box and also contains a silencer that diminishes transcription from the 3' 160-bp portion of the CAII promoter as well as from the SV40 promoter. There are two nonconsensus dual functioning Ap2-like elements on the promoter that are essential for core promoter activity and cAMP-mediated increases in transcription of the gene. A nuclear protein of approximately 65 kDa binds to these elements and is present in nuclear extracts of nonstimulated and forskolin-stimulated NIH-3T3 cells. I conclude that these nonconsensus Ap2-like elements and their cognitive binding protein play a major role in the expression of the CAII gene.
https://openalex.org/W1590974352,"A hypothesis has been proposed for Ca(2+)-binding proteins that a regulatory Ca2+ binding step is endothermic and is driven solely by entropy in the absence of Mg2+ (Imaizumi, M., Tanokura, M., and Yamada, K. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 7963-7966). To confirm this idea, microcalorimetric titrations of wheat germ calmodulin, with Ca2+ in the presence and absence of Mg2+ and with Mg2+ in the absence of Ca2+, have been carried out at 25 degrees C and at pH 7.0. The results indicate that the four binding sites in each molecule are thermodynamically equivalent to one another for both Ca2+ and Mg2+ binding and that the reaction is endothermic for Ca2+ binding in the absence of Mg2+. As compared with bovine brain calmodulin on Ca2+ binding in the absence of Mg2+, Ca2+ binding in both proteins is driven solely by a large favorable entropy change despite unfavorable enthalpy change. Therefore, the above idea seems plausible."
https://openalex.org/W1514075036,"2'-Deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate, 3'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate, and 3'-amino-3'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate were substituted for ATP in the Ca2+ pumping cycle of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. The rate of phosphorylation of the enzyme decreased by more than an order of magnitude when either of the hydroxyl groups was eliminated from the ribose ring. This resulted in low rates of hydrolysis and low levels of phosphoenzyme intermediate. In addition, the Km(1) of hydrolysis and the K1/2 of phosphorylation of the derivatives modified in the 3' position were decreased by a factor of 5-10. Otherwise, the 3'-amino-3'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate was utilized in a manner equivalent to ATP. Because the observed rates of phosphoenzyme formation with the deoxynucleotides were lowered to the extent that they would be rate-limiting in the enzyme cycle, and the level of phosphoenzyme intermediate remained low when the enzyme was back-inhibited by high Ca2+ concentrations, it was concluded that the majority of the enzyme remained in a preliminary conformation, in which the phosphorylation reaction could not proceed although substrate and Ca2+ were bound. It was then proposed that, following Ca(2+)-induced changes in conformation, the hydroxyl groups are able to form hydrogen bonds with pertinent segments of the phosphorylation domain, helping to stabilize an enzyme-substrate complex, one function of which may be to provide the proper stereochemistry for phosphate transfer."
