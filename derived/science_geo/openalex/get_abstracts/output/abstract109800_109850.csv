https://openalex.org/W1983348452,"A putative tumor suppressor locus on the short arm of human chromosome 9 has been localized to a region of less than 40 kilobases by means of homozygous deletions in melanoma cell lines. This region contained a gene, Multiple Tumor Suppressor 1 (MTS1), that encodes a previously identified inhibitor (p16) of cyclin-dependent kinase 4. MTS1 was homozygously deleted at high frequency in cell lines derived from tumors of lung, breast, brain, bone, skin, bladder, kidney, ovary, and lymphocyte. Melanoma cell lines that carried at least one copy of MTS1 frequently carried nonsense, missense, or frameshift mutations in the gene. These findings suggest that MTS1 mutations are involved in tumor formation in a wide range of tissues."

Under conditions that allowed only a limited number of molecular pairs to interact, the force required to separate tip and bead was found to be quantized in integer multiples of 160 +/- 20 piconewtons for biotin and 85 +/- 15 piconewtons for iminobiotin. The measured force quanta are interpreted as the unbinding forces of individual molecular pairs."

https://openalex.org/W2144942522,"Most cells of the dorsal epidermis exit from the mitotic cycle after division 16 in Drosophila embryogenesis. This exit is dependent on the down-regulation of Drosophila cyclin E (DmcycE) during the final mitotic cycle. Ectopic expression of DmcycE after the final mitosis induces entry into S phase and reaccumulation of G2 cyclins and results in progression through a complete additional cell cycle. Conversely, analyses in DmcycE mutant embryos indicate that cyclin E is required for progression through S phase of the mitotic cycle. Moreover, endoreplication, which occurs in late wild-type embryos in the same pattern as DmcycE expression, is not observed in the mutant embryos. Therefore, Drosophila cyclin E, which forms a complex with the Dmcdc2c kinase, controls progression through S phase and its down-regulation limits embryonic proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2040620685,"In response to NGF, the Trk receptor tyrosine kinase forms a complex with SHC, a protein that couples receptor tyrosine kinases to p21ras. Complex formation between Trk and SHC, SHC tyrosine phosphorylation, and association of SHC with Grb2 were mediated by autophosphorylation at Y490 in Trk [sequence: see text]. To determine the role of SHC and other Trk substrates in NGF signaling, Trk receptors with mutations in Y490 and Y785 (the PLC-gamma 1 association site) were introduced into PC12nnr5 cells. NGF treatment of PC12nnr5 cells expressing Trk with mutations in either substrate-binding site resulted in normal neurite outgrowth and Erk1 activity and tyrosine phosphorylation. However, PC12nnr5 cells expressing Trk with mutations at both sites failed to stably extend neurites and efficiently induce Erk1 activity and tyrosine phosphorylation in response to NGF. We postulate that Trk receptors can activate Erk1 by either SHC- or PLC-gamma 1-dependent signaling pathways. These results suggest a model whereby Trk receptors utilize at least partially redundant signal transduction pathways to mediate NGF responses."

https://openalex.org/W2092652351,"The most frequently occurring resistance of Gram-negative bacteria against tetracyclines is triggered by drug recognition of the Tet repressor. This causes dissociation of the repressor-operator DNA complex and enables expression of the resistance protein TetA, which is responsible for active efflux of tetracycline. The 2.5 angstrom resolution crystal structure of the homodimeric Tet repressor complexed with tetracycline-magnesium reveals detailed drug recognition. The orientation of the operator-binding helix-turn-helix motifs of the repressor is inverted in comparison with other DNA binding proteins. The repressor-drug complex is unable to interact with DNA because the separation of the DNA binding motifs is 5 angstroms wider than usually observed."
https://openalex.org/W2122268699,"Using a defined RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription system, we have investigated the roles of basal factors at discrete stages during the transcription cycle (e.g., initiation, promoter clearance, and transcript elongation). Abortive initiation assays revealed that TATA-binding protein, transcription factors TFIIB and TFIIF, and pol II were necessary and sufficient to form functional initiation complexes on both linear and supercoiled templates. By contrast, TFIIE, TFIIH, and ATP hydrolysis were additionally required during promoter clearance from linear templates, while negative supercoiling obviated the need for these auxiliary factors. Furthermore, TFIIE, TFIIH, and supercoiling were not required during elongation. Our results suggest a role for TFIIH-associated helicase activity or supercoiling during promoter clearance rather than open complex formation. These results establish abortive initiation as a useful assay for studying functional initiation complex formation in defined eukaryotic transcription systems and provide a framework for investigating regulation at different stages of the eukaryotic transcription cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2038733481,"We have characterized a cell, the Schwann cell precursor, that represents a distinct intermediate differentiation stage in the process by which Schwann cells are generated from neural crest cells. The Schwann cell precursor shows radical differences from Schwann cells which include death regulation, antigenic phenotype, pattern of cell-cell interaction, migratory behavior, and morphology. In the nerves of the rat hind limb, Schwann cells are irreversibly generated from these during a brief period, essentially embryonic days 15-17. We also provide evidence that the survival of Schwann cell precursors is regulated by neurons and identify basic fibroblast growth factor as a potential key regulator of apoptosis in Schwann cell precursors and of precursor to Schwann cell conversion. These findings have implications for our understanding of gliogenesis in the peripheral nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2088347811,"Transgenic flies carrying a 7.2 kb piece of DNA from the period (per) gene were analyzed for the presence of circadian locomotor activity rhythms and fluctuations of per-encoded mRNA and protein. The 5' end of this genomic fragment is within the first intron, which precedes the coding region. This promotorless fragment could rescue circadian behavioral rhythms and mediate spatial expression of PER in a subset of wild-type per cells within the CNS and PNS. In one behaviorally rhythmic line, PER protein was found in only ""per lateral neurons."" In the rhythmic transgenics, per mRNA and protein levels undergo circadian cycling, as previously described for wild type. Cycling of PER in brain cells of flies carrying the same 7.2 kb piece of per DNA under the control of a heat shock promoter corroborated the hypothesis that per's molecular cyclings and behavioral rhythmicity are causally related."
https://openalex.org/W1992214487,"Precursor B (pre-B) cells in bone marrow of normal and B cell-deficient mutant mice were analyzed for the expression of Vpre-B/λ5 surrogate light chain (SL). The surface expression of SL is confined to the early stages (pro-B and pre-B-I) of pre-B cell development and becomes undetectable once μ heavy chain (μH) is produced. The cell-cycle analysis revealed that cytoplasmic μH+ large cells (large pre-B-II), ∼30% of which coexpressed SL in the cytoplasm, were most actively cycling, whereas cytoplasmic μH+ small cells (small pre-B-II) were SL− and not in cycle. The analysis of pre-B cells in B cell-deficient mice suggests that the large pre-B-II stage is a critical step for the selection and amplification of cells carrying functionally rearranged μH genes."
https://openalex.org/W2028825267,"cDNA (ClC-3) encoding a protein kinase C-regulated chloride channel was cloned and characterized. The open reading frame encodes 760 amino acids, which possess significant amino acid identity with previously cloned ClC chloride channels. The chloride currents expressed in Xenopus oocytes injected with ClC-3 cRNA were completely blocked by activation of protein kinase C by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate. Abundant expression of ClC-3 mRNA was observed in rat brain, especially in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus, and cerebellum. These findings suggest that ClC-3 may play an important role in neuronal cell function through regulation of membrane excitability by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2005532410,"The pharynx of C. elegans, a model system for neural networks and for membrane excitability, has been chiefly studied by observing its behavior in normal worms, in mutant worms, and in worms lacking pharyngeal neurons. To complement this behavioral approach, we devised a method for recording currents produced by changes in pharyngeal muscle membrane potential. The electrical records, called electropharyngeograms, contain transients caused by pharyngeal muscle action potentials and by inhibitory synaptic transmission between pharyngeal neuron M3 and the muscle. Using the electropharyngeograms, we show that gamma-aminobutyric acid is not likely to be the M3 neurotransmitter, that synaptic transmission is present but abnormal in mutants lacking synaptotagmin, and that worms mutant in the eat-4 gene are defective for M3 function or transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2091194839,"The sensitivity of synaptic transmission to antagonists of different calcium channels was examined at the powerful climbing fiber synapse between neurons from the inferior olive and cerebellar Purkinje cells. In rat brain slices, climbing fibers were activated with extracellular electrodes, and synaptic currents were recorded with whole-cell patch clamp. Dihydropyridines did not discernibly affect synaptic strength. omega-Conotoxin GVIA, a potent antagonist of N-type calcium channels, reduced synaptic currents by an average of 29%. omega-Agatoxin-IVA, a high affinity blocker of P-type calcium channels, reduced synaptic strength by an average of 77%. Together, the two toxins virtually eliminated synaptic transmission (91% inhibition). These results indicate that omega-agatoxin-IVA-sensitive calcium channels play an important role in transmission at the climbing fiber synapse. They also suggest that in single climbing fibers, release is evoked by at least two pharmacologically distinct calcium currents, one sensitive to omega-agatoxin-IVA, the other to omega-conotoxin GVIA."
https://openalex.org/W2083091935,"A complementation strategy was developed to define the signaling pathways activated by the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase. Transformation inactive point mutants of Bcr-Abl were tested for complementation with c-Myc. Single point mutations in the Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain, the major tyrosine autophosphorylation site of the kinase domain, and the Grb-2 binding site in the Bcr region impaired the transformation of fibroblasts by Bcr-Abl. Hyperexpression of c-Myc efficiently restored transformation activity only to the Bcr-Abl SH2 mutant. These data support a model in which Bcr-Abl activates at least two independent pathways for transformation. This strategy may be useful for discerning signaling pathways activated by other oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W2058058541,"We report the cloning and subcellular localization of a novel Schwann cell-specific protein of 147 kd that we have named periaxin. Periaxin has a remarkable domain of repetitive pentameric units in the primary sequence. It is expressed in the first uncompacted whorls of membrane that ensheathe the axon, and further synthesis of the protein in the rat sciatic nerve parallels the deposition of myelin. In mature myelin, periaxin colocalizes with the myelin-associated glycoprotein in the cytoplasm-filled periaxonal regions of the sheath but is excluded from compact myelin. We propose that periaxin has a role in axon-glial interactions, possibly by interacting with the cytoplasmic domains of integral membrane proteins such as myelin-associated glycoprotein in the periaxonal regions of the Schwann cell plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2008062776,"The structural basis for the synthesis of specific proteins within distinct intraneuronal compartments is unknown. We studied the distribution of poly(A) mRNA within cultured cerebrocortical neurons using high resolution in situ hybridization to identify cytoskeletal components that may anchor mRNA. After 1 day in culture, poly(A) mRNA was distributed throughout all of the initial neurites, including the axon-like process. At 4 days in culture, poly(A) mRNA was distributed throughout the cell body and dendritic processes, but confined to the proximal segment of the axon. Poly(A) mRNA was bound to the cytoskeleton as demonstrated by resistance to detergent extraction. Perturbation of microtubules with colchicine resulted in a major reduction of dendritic poly(A) mRNA; however, this distribution was unaffected by cytochalasin. Ultrastructural in situ hybridization revealed that poly(A) mRNA and associated ribosomes were excluded from tightly bundled microtubules."
https://openalex.org/W2090876685,The molecular weights of femtomole quantities of small peptides attached to polystyrene beads have been determined with imaging time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The analysis is made possible by the selective clipping of the bond linking the peptide to a bead with trifluoroacetic acid vapor before the secondary ion mass spectrometry assay. The approach can be applied to large numbers of 30- to 60-micrometer polystyrene beads for the direct characterization of massive combinatorial libraries.
https://openalex.org/W2045402029,"The survival of neurons in the developing isthmo-optic nucleus (ION) is believed to depend on the retrograde transport of trophic molecules from the target, the contralateral retina. We now show that ION neurons transport nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) retrogradely and that BDNF and NT-3 support the survival of ION neurons in vivo and promote neurite outgrowth in vitro. Surprisingly, NGF enhanced normal developmental cell death in vivo in a dose-dependent way. These findings show that increased levels of NGF can have adverse effects on differentiated neurons. The negative effect of NGF could be mimicked by intraocular injection of antibodies that block binding of neurotrophins to the 75 kd neurotrophin receptor (p75). These data implicate a role for the p75 receptor in NGF's neurotoxicity and indicate that this receptor is involved in the mechanism by which ION neurons respond to BDNF and NT-3 in the target."
https://openalex.org/W1999719590,"Three different experimental approaches were used to establish that the first transmembrane segment (S1) is important for K+ channel assembly. First, hydrodynamic analyses of in vitro translated Kv1.1 N-terminal domain containing the S1 segment coassembles to form homotetrameric complexes, whereas deletion of the S1 segment abolishes coassembly. Second, coimmunoprecipitation experiments of cotranslated Kv1.1 and Kv1.5 truncated polypeptides show that the S1 segment is essential for coimmunoprecipitation. Third, dominant negative experiments in Xenopus oocytes confirm that over-expression of either the S1 segment or the N-terminal domain is sufficient for abolishing the expression of functional Kv1.1 and Kv1.5 K+ channels. These data indicate that S1 segment plays an important role in the coassembly of homo- and heterotetrameric K+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1979699887,"We have used the T7 DNA replication system to examine coordination of leading and lagging strand synthesis at a replication fork. The 63 kd gene 4 protein provides both helicase and primase activities; we demonstrate that primer synthesis inhibits helicase activity on a synthetic replication fork. Lagging strand DNA synthesis by a complex of gene 4 protein and T7 DNA polymerase decreases the rate of leading strand synthesis. Both leading and lagging strand synthesis are resistant to dilution of the replication proteins, and to challenge with heparin. Furthermore, dilution does not increase the average length of Okazaki fragments. We propose that leading and lagging strand synthesis at a T7 replication fork are coupled and that the replication proteins are recycled."
https://openalex.org/W1975856831,"The tandemly repeated DNA sequence poly(CA).poly(TG) is found in tracts up to 60 base pairs long, dispersed at thousands of sites throughout the genomes of eukaryotes. Double-stranded DNA fragments containing such sequences associated spontaneously with each other in vitro, in the absence of protein, forming stable four-stranded structures that were detected by gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. These structures were recognized specifically by the nuclear nonhistone high mobility group (HMG) proteins 1 and 2 as evidenced by gel retardation. Such sequence-specific complexes might be involved in vivo in recombination or other processes requiring specific association of two double-stranded DNA molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1986574221,"Cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channels in photoreceptors and olfactory neurons are activated by intracellular ligands (cAMP and cGMP) rather than voltage. Surprisingly, these channels share amino acid sequence homology with voltage-gated channels. Here we show that the distinct gating mechanisms exhibited by CNG and voltage-gated channels share features that reflect this structural homology. Thus, a 20 amino acid peptide (""ball peptide"") derived from the Shaker-type K+ channel and responsible for its rapid inactivation also blocks CNG channels. Moreover, the peptide selectively blocks open CNG channels and prevents channel closure, showing that CNG channel activation, like activation of voltage-dependent K+ channels, involves the opening of a gate located on the intracellular side of the peptide-binding site. Amino acid substitutions in the peptide cause similar changes in blocking affinity of CNG and K+ channels, suggesting a conserved binding site. Using a chimeric retinal/olfactory channel, we show that the difference in the peptide affinity of the two CNG channels is due to a difference in the amino acid sequence of the conserved pore-forming region, demonstrating that this domain forms part of the peptide receptor."
