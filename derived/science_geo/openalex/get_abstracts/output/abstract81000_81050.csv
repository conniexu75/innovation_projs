https://openalex.org/W1524333424,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF)-enhanced protein kinase activity in plasma membrane preparations of A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells was shown to involve the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues. Phosphotyrosine was detected in both endogenous membrane proteins and in histone when added as an exogenous protein substrate. The major phosphorylated amino acid in partial acid hydrolysates of 32P-labeled A-431 membranes was identified as phosphotyrosine on the basis of its identical behavior to authentic phosphotyrosine on paper electrophoresis and thin layer chromatography; its 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl (dansyl) derivative was indistinguishable from that of the authentic compound. Only traces, if any, of phosphoserine or phosphothreonine were detected. [32P]Phosphotyrosine was also detected in pronase digests of 32P-labeled membrane proteins. The EGF receptor . protein kinase complex, which was solubilized with Triton X-100 and purified by EGF affinity chromatography, was shown to phosphorylate tyrosine residues of the isolated membrane protein."

https://openalex.org/W2090389394,"Numerous peptides appear to be neurotransmitter candidates in the brain. Some, such as the opioid peptide enkephalins, neurotensin, and substance P, were first isolaterd from the brain. Peptides, such as cholecystokinin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, were known as intestinal hormones and later recognized as brain constituents. Certain hypothalamic-releasing hormones, pituitary peptides, and blood-derived peptides like angiotensin II and bradykinin, may also be central neurotransmitters. The diversity of localization of these peptides throughout the brain implies a multiplicity of potential roles."
https://openalex.org/W2013750006,"This report identifies a component of normal human fibroblasts that forms a covalent linkage with thrombin and urokinase (urinary plasmingoen activator) and mediates most of the specific cellular binding of these proteases. This component, here named protease-nexin (PN), is both associated with the cell surface and released into the culture medium. In several ways PN resembles antithrombin III (AT3), a prominent inhibitor of thrombin in serum: PN links thrombin, probably via an ester bond; PN does not link thrombin blocked at its catalytic site serine; PN has a high-affinity heparin-binding site; and heparin greatly accelerates the rate of linkage between soluble PN and thrombin. Despite these similarities, PN and AT3 are distinct; they differ in size and are not immunologically cross-reactive. Whereas AT3 regulates the proteolytic activity of thrombin in serum, PN may regulates the activity of serine proteases at and near the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2094635321,"Receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific ligands is mediated through clustering of receptor-ligand complexes in coated pits on the cell surface. Following this clustering event, the ligand is internalized into a noncoated intracellular vesicle, the receptosome, which selectively avoids fusion with lysosomes and moves toward the Golgi region of the cell by saltatory motion. Using alpha 2-macroglobulin as the ligand and electron microscopic cytochemical methods, we have shown the unusual appearance of this previously undescribed organelle and have followed the labeled ligand in these vesicles in the cytoplasm. To accomplish this, cells were incubated with immunolabeled alpha 2-macroglobulin at 4C under conditions where ligand-receptor complexes cluster into coated pits on the cell surface. Formation of the receptosome occurs between 2 and 5 min after raising the temperature of cells to 37C. These labeled receptosomes were seen to associate with many small vesicular elements in the cytoplasm, and were often found near the Golgi or GERL region after 15 min. Between 15 and 30 min a significant transfer of labeled ligand occurred from the receptosomal population to a population of small uniform lysosomes. By 60 min, all of the label was contained in these small lysosomes. Immunocytochemical studies showed that the receptosomes were not associated with clathrin, actin, myosin or tubulin. This unique, short-lived, specialized organelle selectively delivers the products of receptor-mediated endocytosis to intracellular sites."
https://openalex.org/W2028518884,"Anchorage-dependent mouse fibroblasts grow only if attached to and spread on a solid substrate. The suspension of cells in methyl-cellulose results in dramatic, coordinated inhibition of the major RNA and protein synthesis systems, and these systems are sequentially restored when cells are replated on a tissue culture dish surface. In the present report the effects on metabolism of cell reattachment are separated from those of subsequent spreading by controlling cell shape. Macromolecular metabolism is first strongly suppressed by long-term suspension culture. The cells are then replated in the presence of a variety of spreading inhibitors. The recovery of protein synthesis, which rapidly follows reattachment, does not require extensive cell spreading. Contact of a limited portion of the plasma membrane with the solid culture dish surface is apparently a sufficient signal by itself. A very different method of controlling cell shape is afforded by changing culture dish surface adhesivity. Suspended cells are replated on dishes precoated with thin layers of the hydrophilic hydrogen poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate). The final mean cell diameter is then varied over wide limits. As before, protein synthesis recovery is unaffected. However, nuclear events such as DNA and rRNA synthesis and mRNA production are profoundly affected by cell shape. Thus, cell surface contact and cell shape give rise to distinctly different regulatory responses."

https://openalex.org/W1607780302,"A number of enzymes, including amylases, dehydrogenases, and proteases, were shown to be renaturable after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Enzyme activity was detected in situ by action on substrates introduced into the gel and subsequent staining of either the product or unreacted substrate. This technique combines the advantage of enzyme identification with the resolution and molecular weight dependence of gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Enzymes appeared to recover activity as soon as the detergent diffused out of the gel. Most monomeric enzymes could be renatured even after disruption of their disulfide bonds, but several proteases, including trypsin, could not. Oligomeric enzymes composed of identical subunits were poorly renaturable. Renatured enzymes were retained in gels after electrophoresis longer than native enzymes which had been subjected to electrophoresis in the absence of detergent. Re-electrophoresis of the renatured enzymes showed that part of the retained activity was physically anchored to the gel, possibly by the folding of polypeptide aroung the gel matrix as the enzymes were renatured."
https://openalex.org/W2095413803,"We have determined the nucleotide sequence of two different mouse alpha-amylase mRNAs, one found in the pancreas and the other in the salivary gland. The 1577 and 1659 nucleotide mRNAs from pancreas and salivary gland, respectively are the major alpha-amylase species which accumulate in each tissue. Differences in mRNA length are primarily in the 5' noncoding regions. Comparable portions of the mRNAs are 89% homologous. The mRNA sequences predict alpha-amylase precursor proteins of 508 and 511 amino acid residues, accounting for nearly the entire coding capacity of the mRNAs; differences in protein length occur as a result of a nine nucleotide segment present within the translated portion of salivary gland, but not pancreas, mRNA. The lengths and amino acid compositions of the predicted proteins concur with those determined empirically by others. These proteins differ 12% in amino acid sequence, explaining previously observed differences in net charge and antigenic properties. Finally, translation of the salivary gland alpha-amylase mRNA is not initiated at the AUG codon nearest the 5' terminus since that codon is almost immediately followed by the termination triplet UAA. This observation may have implications for the mechanism of translation initiation in eucaroytes."

By measuring the synthesis of individual r proteins after specific oversynthesis of nine different ribosomal proteins from the S10 operon, we now find that one, L4, affects the expression of the operon. Moreover, the induction of L4 synthesis results in a strong reduction of the synthesis of mRNA from at least four genes of the S10 operon."

The possibility that this effect is mediated by interferon is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2006168559,"The patterns of protein synthesis in barley aleurone layers treated with gibberellic acid (GA3) and abscisic acid (ABA) are compared with the patterns observed in wheat germ in vitro translation assays directed by RNA isolated from similarly treated layers. When used alone, GA3 and ABA both induce the formation of new translatable mRNAs and cause new proteins to be synthesized. The effects of GA3 are more dramatic than those of ABA. In GA3-treated tissues, overall protein synthesis is redirected to produce large quantities of α-amylase and a few other GA3-induced proteins, while other protein synthesis is reduced or stopped. Large amounts of new translatable mRNA for α-amylase are also induced such that the dominant in vitro translation product is α-amylase. These changes are blocked by the simultaneous addition of ABA to the tissue. In GA3 plus ABA-treated layers, few changes in protein synthesis in vivo are observed when compared to protein synthesis in untreated tissue, although the induction of mRNA for α-amylase and the other GA3-induced mRNAs does occur. This indicates that ABA does not interfere with GA3 induction of translatable mRNAs but prevents the translation of these mRNAs in vivo. Thus ABA and potentially GA3 regulate the translation of proteins in vivo in barley aleurone layers."
https://openalex.org/W1499644887,"Bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycan monomer which had been digested with chondroitinase ABC to form the keratan sulfate-protein core was injected into rabbits. High titer antiserum was obtained as judged by the binding of 125I-labeled keratan sulfate-protein core. Native proteoglycan did not inhibit the interaction of the antiserum with labeled keratan sulfate-protein core. However, the disaccharide obtained from chondroitin 4-sulfate by the action of chondroitinase ABC, 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-3-O-(beta-D-gluco-4-enepyranosyluronic acid)-4-O-sulfo-D-galactose, inhibited the interaction 50% at a concentration of 500 microM. The corresponding 6-sulfated and nonsulfated disaccharides at the same concentration gave 15% and 10% inhibition, respectively. Chondroitinase-digested proteoglycan from Swarm rat chondrosarcoma was strongly inhibitory, while the hyaluronidase-digested chondrosarcoma proteoglycan exhibited no detectable inhibition. Evidently, the antiserum raised against chondroitinase ABC-digested bovine nasal cartilage proteoglycan contains antibodies which recognize the unsaturated uronic acid residue linked to N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate. These antibodies will be valuable for identifying and quantitating chondroitin 4-sulfate-containing proteoglycans in tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1544598568,"A hen oviduct membrane preparation that catalyzes both the N- and O-glycosylation of exogenous acceptor peptides was used to examine the possible involvement of lipid intermediates in enzymatic O-glycosylation. The results indicate that, under a variety of experimental conditions in which the dolichol-linked saccharides involved in N-glycosylation are readily observed, no lipid-linked intermediates for O-glycosylation could be detected. Whereas N-glycosylation is abolished by tunicamycin treatment and stimulated by dolichol phosphate addition, O-glycosylation is unaffected by such treatments. Further, the results of subcellular fractionation of oviduct membranes suggest that N-acetylgalactosaminyl:polypeptide transferase is localized primarily in membranes derived from the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. This is in contrast to the subcellular site of N-glycosylation, which has previously been shown to be primarily the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These findings are discussed in relation to the function of dolichol phosphate in protein glycosylation."

https://openalex.org/W2408736732,"Ribonuclease P from Bacillus subtilis cleaves a Gln-Leu tRNA dimeric precursor from bacteriophage T4-infected Escherichia coli, yielding products identical with those generated by the E. coli RNase P. Using this tRNA dimer as an assay substrate, the RNase of P of B. subtilis was shown to consist of at least two components, one of which bands in CsCl equilibrium buoyant density centrifugation at 1.7 g/ml, characteristic of a protein x nucleic acid complex. Both this component and a second, retrieved from the low density (less than 1.4 g/ml) regions of CsCl gradients, are required for RNase P activity. Enzyme activity is abolished by treating the component of density 1.7 g/ml with insoluble RNase A prior to assay. These observations suggest that the RNase P of B. subtilis, like that of E. coli, contain a RNA component essential for activity. That this RNA component is of functional importance, and not an artifact of isolation procedures, is supported by the fact that it is observed in these two phylogenetically disparate organisms."
https://openalex.org/W274425567,"Human alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M) is inhibited by covalent reaction with alkylamines. The site of methylamine incorporation has been proposed to be an activated glutamyl residue (Swenson, R. P., and Howard, J. B. (1979) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 76, 4313-4316). A large, 56-amino acid residue glycopeptide derived from tryptic cleavage of [14C]methylamine-labeled alpha 2M was isolated. Based upon recovery of the specific radioactivity in the peptide, there appears to be only a single site of incorporation per Mr = 185,000 subunit. The complete amino acid sequence was deduced from Edman degradation and carboxypeptidase Y digestion of the tryptic peptide and of several small peptides derived from it. The structure of the radiolabeled amino acid was determined to be gamma-glutamylmethylamide by mass spectral analysis of the phenylthiohydantoin and N-benzoyl-O-methylester derivatives. The putative structure was confirmed by a comparison of the mass spectral and chromatographic properties of the authentic compound and the protein-derived amino acid residue. The 10 amino acid residues following the methylamine-reactive glutamyl residue were identical with the first 10 amino acid residues of the pyroglutaminase-deblocked, Mr = 65,000 fragment generated by heat denaturation of alpha 2M (Howard, J. B., Vermeulen, M., and Swenson, R. P. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3820-3823)."

https://openalex.org/W1585952720,"Enzyme activities of the sn-glycerol 3-phosphate (glycerol-P) and of the dihydroxyacetone-phosphte (DHAP) pathway of glycerolipid biosynthesis were investigated during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes. Total particulate glycerol-P and DHAP acyltransferase activities increased 70- and 30-fold, respectively, during differentiation induced with methylisobutylxanthine and dexamethasone. The N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive (microsomal) glycerol-P and DHAP acyltransferase activities were virtually undetectable in nondifferentiated cells, and increased in parallel over 70-fold during differentiation. These and several kinetic observations are consistent with the induction of a single microsomal enzyme having dual activity. During differentiaion, the N-ethylmaleimide-resistant DHAP acyltransferase activity increased 10-fold, suggesting the presence of at least two DHAP acyltransferase isoenzymes. Qualitatively similar changes in microsomal glycerol-P and DHAP acyltransferase activities were observed when cell differentiation was induced with insulin or with insulin plus dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine. Acyl-DHAP oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.101) specific activity increased only 3- to 5-fold during adipocyte differentiation. Alkyl-DHAP synthase activity was not detected. These data demonstrate that selective changes in enzyme activities of the gycerol-P pathways of glycerolipid synthesis occur during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1540379142,"Poly(A)+RNA from phenol-extracted rat liver polysomes was translated in a heterologous cell-free system derived from wheat germ. The RNA stimulated the incorporation of [35S]methionine into proteins 20- to 30-fold. The labeled translation products were incubated with an antiserum against cytochrome c oxidase. After binding of the antigen x immunoglobulin complex to and elution from protein A-Sepharose and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide step gel electrophoresis, autoradiography was carried out. Mainly one major protein with an apparent molecular weight of 19,500 was visualized. When the unlabeled individual cytochrome c oxidase subunits IV, V, VI, or VII, isolated from preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gels, were added to the translation mixture, it was found that only subunit IV could compete with the in vitro-synthesized protein of 19.5 kilodaltons in respect to the binding to the cytochrome c oxidase antiserum. The in vitro-synthesized product was 3,000 daltons larger than the cytochrome c oxidase subunit polypeptide IV. It is concluded that the subunit IV is synthesized as a precursor. Evidence for the precursor form was obtained from translation experiments with [35S]methionine bound to a specific initiator tRNA which led to a radioactively labeled product of identical electrophoretic mobility as the 19.5 kilodalton protein. Furthermore, two dimensional tryptic fingerprints of subunit IV and its precursor show a high degree of similarity."

https://openalex.org/W2132313233,"Insertions of the transposon Tn 10 have been obtained in an E. coli ribosomal RNA operon (rrnX). These insertions were used to determine whether present models of polarity are sufficient to explain transcriptional properties of operon which are transcribed but not translated. Most models of polarity suggest that transcription of mRNA requires simultaneous translation of nascent mRNA, or else premature termination of transcription will result. This model as stated does not encompass rrn operons. In this study three Tn 10 insertions into rrnX were characterized. All three Tn 10 insertions do not completely eliminate in vivo transcription of the most distal tRNA gene of rrnX. In ultraviolet-irradiated cells one Tn 10 insertion reduces synthesis of downstream portions of rrnX by at most 2--3 fold. Two other insertions may have more extensive polar effects, although the exact level of polarity is difficult to evaluate because these Tn 10 insertions may affect RNA maturation and stability."
https://openalex.org/W1514340368,"Low concentrations (0.10 to 1.0 microgram/ml) of alpha-amanitin inhibit wheat embryo germination. Labeled RNA, synthesized in vivo by embryos imbibed in the presence of [3H]uridine and various concentrations of alpha-amanitin, was analyzed by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatograhy and by gel electrophoresis (acrylamide and agarose) coupled with fluorography. Low concentrations of alpha-amanitin (0.10 to 1.0 microgram/ml) strongly and selectively inhibited in vivo poly(A) + RNA synthesis in a manner which closely paralleled alpha-amanitin inhibition of purified RNA polymerase II. These results suggest that de novo mRNA transcription is required for germination. Higher concentrations of alpha-amanitin inhibited in vivo 5 S rRNA and tRNA synthesis in a manner which closely paralleled alpha-amanitin inhibition of purified RNA polymerase III. High concentrations of alpha-amanitin also inhibited accumulation of radioactivity into the rRNA precursor as well as into mature 25 S and 18 S rRNAs in a manner which also closely paralleled alpha-amanitin inhibition of RNA polymerase III. The discrepancy of the in vivo inhibitory effect of high alpha-amanitin concentrations on rRNA synthesis versus a lack of effect on purified RNA polymerase I, which presumably transcribes these genes, can be explained if continued transcription of the large rRNA precursor by RNA polymerase I requires ongoing transcription by RNA polymerase III, or if there is degradation (wastage) of rRNA precursor and/or processed products in the absence of transcription by RNA polymerase III."
https://openalex.org/W2094403074,"Scald injury to one ear of the hairless mouse induced significant (P < .05) delayed edema formation in remote, uninjured skin. This remote edema formation was completely inhibited by immediate cold-water treatment of the scalded ear. Cold-water treatment significantly reduced histamine loss from the scalded ear, and the edema-inhibiting effect of the treatment could be mimicked by treating the animal prior to injury with the H2-histamine receptor antagonist cimetidine or a drug that causes histamine depletion. These observations suggest (i) that a histamine-mediated, delayed permeability response occurs after thermal injury that causes remote edema formation and (ii) that one mechanism of remote edema inhibition by cold-water treatment is the prevention of histamine release from thermally injured tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1590142736,"Abstract Ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) sedimenting between 10 and 15 S were isolated from the postpolysomal cytoplasmic fraction of embryonic chicken muscle. These RNP complexes lack mRNA but contain RNA with a sedimentation coefficient of 4.4 S. The 4.4 S RNA did not arise as a product of degradation during the course of the isolation procedure nor did it contain oligo(U)- or poly(A)-rich regions. Furthermore, the 4.4 S RNA-containing RNP complex was easily separable from free mRNPs and, therefore, is not considered as part of the free mRNP complexes. Both the 4.4 S RNA and 10 to 15 S RNP were able to inhibit translation of either capped or uncapped mRNA in a heterologous cell-free system. This inhibitory effect may result from interference of 4.4 S RNA with an early event in mRNA translation. A large number of polypeptides of Mr = 14,000 to 220,000 were present in the 10 to 15 S RNP. Among these, the most prominent polypeptides were of Mr = 36,000; 48,000; 52,000; 58,000; 65,000; 78,000; 84,000; 96,000; 105,000; 165,000; and 220,000.

https://openalex.org/W1508937650,"Abstract Antibodies elicited in rabbits against horse cytochrome c cross-react in varying degree with the cytochromes c of other species. Radioimmunoassay experiments are described in which 23% of the immunoglobulin shown to bind to horse cytochrome c fails to react with beef cytochrome c, and 14% of that bound by beef cytochrome c does not react with rabbit cytochrome c. Studies of hybrid cytochromes, prepared by a reconstitution procedure involving the cleavage and re-formation of peptide bond 65-66, show that these differences result from single amino acid replacements, Beef cytochrome c differs in binding capacity from horse cytochrome c as a result of the substitution of a glycine for a lysine residue in sequence position 60, and the difference between rabbit cytochrome c and beef cytochrome c reflects the substitution of a valine for a proline residue in position 44. Reconstituted horse cytochrome c and reconstituted beef cytochrome c have binding capacities indistinguishable from those of the parent proteins. The presence of a homoserine rather than a methionine residue in position 65 results, in the case of the reconstituted horse molecule, in a slightly lower affinity for the antibody population directed against the lysine-60 region. A corresponding difference is not observed in the case of beef cytochrome c and its reconstitution product, which do not bind the population in question."

We show here that wheat embryonic axes further metabolize 6-azauridine to the 5'-triphosphate and incorporate the analogue into RNA, thus offering an alternative mechanism for growth inhibition. At a level of 6-azauridine required to maximally inhibit UTP biosynthesis, the ratio of 6-azaUTP to UTP is about 2:1 and substitution of 6-azauridine for uridine in new RNA is on the order of 1 in 18. The new metabolites of 6-azauridine are identified by high pressure and thin layer chromatography coupled with enzyme treatments."

The protection of the carriers toward enzymatic oxidation by 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase from rat liver has been studied. Concentrations of carrier protein and estradiol were adjusted to give free estradiol concentrations varying from Km/10 to Km/100 and the ratio of the catalytic velocity to that observed for the same concentration of free estradiol in the absence of carrier protein were recorded. With alpha-fetoprotein the ratio fell as expected as the carrier concentration was increased, but with serum albumin the ratio was close to unity when the concentration of carrier protein was increased from 70 to 700 microM. Thus, a fetoprotein but not albumin protected the steroid against catalytic oxidation. Similar experiments were carried out replacing the mammalian enzyme by the dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas testosteroni, and in this case, both carrier proteins protected the substrate. The lack of protection by albumin against the dehydrogenation by the mammalian enzyme is discussed."
