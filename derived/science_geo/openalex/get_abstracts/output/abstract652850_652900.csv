https://openalex.org/W3012327875,"Applications of adenine base editors (ABEs) have been constrained by the limited compatibility of the deoxyadenosine deaminase component with Cas homologs other than SpCas9. We evolved the deaminase component of ABE7.10 using phage-assisted non-continuous and continuous evolution (PANCE and PACE), which resulted in ABE8e. ABE8e contains eight additional mutations that increase activity (kapp) 590-fold compared with that of ABE7.10. ABE8e offers substantially improved editing efficiencies when paired with a variety of Cas9 or Cas12 homologs. ABE8e is more processive than ABE7.10, which could benefit screening, disruption of regulatory regions and multiplex base editing applications. A modest increase in Cas9-dependent and -independent DNA off-target editing, and in transcriptome-wide RNA off-target editing can be ameliorated by the introduction of an additional mutation in the TadA-8e domain. Finally, we show that ABE8e can efficiently install natural mutations that upregulate fetal hemoglobin expression in the BCL11A enhancer or in the the HBG promoter in human cells, targets that were poorly edited with ABE7.10. ABE8e augments the effectiveness and applicability of adenine base editing. A continuously evolved adenine base editor is compatible with various Cas proteins and mediates efficient A•T-to-G•C base conversions at a wide variety of PAM sites."
https://openalex.org/W3024213468,"Triacylglycerols store metabolic energy in organisms and have industrial uses as foods and fuels. Excessive accumulation of triacylglycerols in humans causes obesity and is associated with metabolic diseases1. Triacylglycerol synthesis is catalysed by acyl-CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) enzymes2–4, the structures and catalytic mechanisms of which remain unknown. Here we determined the structure of dimeric human DGAT1, a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family, by cryo-electron microscopy at approximately 3.0 A resolution. DGAT1 forms a homodimer through N-terminal segments and a hydrophobic interface, with putative active sites within the membrane region. A structure obtained with oleoyl-CoA substrate resolved at approximately 3.2 A shows that the CoA moiety binds DGAT1 on the cytosolic side and the acyl group lies deep within a hydrophobic channel, positioning the acyl-CoA thioester bond near an invariant catalytic histidine residue. The reaction centre is located inside a large cavity, which opens laterally to the membrane bilayer, providing lipid access to the active site. A lipid-like density—possibly representing an acyl-acceptor molecule—is located within the reaction centre, orthogonal to acyl-CoA. Insights provided by the DGAT1 structures, together with mutagenesis and functional studies, provide the basis for a model of the catalysis of triacylglycerol synthesis by DGAT. Cryo-electron microscopy structures and functional and mutagenesis studies provide insights into the catalysis of triacylglycerol synthesis by human acyl-CoA diacylglycerol acyltransferase at its intramembrane active site."
https://openalex.org/W3024416844,"This paper studied the relationship between personality traits and mental health conditions of medical personnel to provide a basis and reference for the implementation of targeted education on mental health. A self-report inventory, the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), was used to investigate the mental health status of 548 medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus pneumonia in eight provinces and cities of China. The overall mean SCL-90 score and mean values of factors (somatization, obsessive-compulsive, anxiety, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism) of the medical personnel were significantly higher than in the norm group (p < 0.05), while their average interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly lower (p < 0.01). In addition, personal factors affecting the mental health status of medical personnel were identified (all p < 0.05). The overall mental health status of medical personnel responding to new coronavirus pneumonia is generally higher than that of the norm group in China. The results of this study should contribute to measures to alleviate the psychological pressures on medical personnel dealing with the new coronavirus epidemic in China."
https://openalex.org/W3024565489,"Diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) synthesizes triacylglycerides and is required for dietary fat absorption and fat storage in humans1. DGAT1 belongs to the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) superfamily, members of which are found in all kingdoms of life and are involved in the acylation of lipids and proteins2,3. How human DGAT1 and other mammalian members of the MBOAT family recognize their substrates and catalyse their reactions is unknown. The absence of three-dimensional structures also hampers rational targeting of DGAT1 for therapeutic purposes. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of human DGAT1 in complex with an oleoyl-CoA substrate. Each DGAT1 protomer has nine transmembrane helices, eight of which form a conserved structural fold that we name the MBOAT fold. The MBOAT fold in DGAT1 forms a hollow chamber in the membrane that encloses highly conserved catalytic residues. The chamber has separate entrances for each of the two substrates, fatty acyl-CoA and diacylglycerol. DGAT1 can exist as either a homodimer or a homotetramer and the two forms have similar enzymatic activity. The N terminus of DGAT1 interacts with the neighbouring protomer and these interactions are required for enzymatic activity. The structure of human diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1, a membrane protein that synthesizes triacylglycerides, is solved with cryo-electron microscopy, providing insight into its function and mechanism of enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3028060581,"Ziziphus lotus L. (Lam.) and Z. mauritiana Lam., as a widespread species in Tunisia, are well known for their medicinal and food uses. The aim of the present study was to screen the content of total polyphenols, flavonoids, and condensed tannins together with the radical scavenging capacity and the antimicrobial activity of leaves, fruits and seeds extracts of Z. lotus and Z. mauritiana from different localities. Results showed that leaves extracts presented the highest phenolic compounds content for both species. Furthermore, LC-ESI-MS analysis allowed the identification of 28 bioactive compounds regardless of species and organs, with the predominance of quinic acid and rutin. Leaves extract of Z. mauritiana possessed the highest total antioxidant capacity. The antimicrobial tests showed that leaves extracts of Z. mauritiana and Z. lotus from Oued Esseder exhibited the highest activity against four bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli). The main results showed that the studied species of Ziziphus genus are an excellent source of natural bioactive molecules that could be an interesting material for industrial and food purposes."
https://openalex.org/W3028081597,"Most studies on HIV testing among young people in Nigeria are not nationally representative. As such, recent nationally representative data, such as the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS), could help assess the current level of HIV testing among young people, a key target population for HIV prevention in the country. In this study, we examined the coverage and factors associated with HIV testing among adolescents and young adults (AYA).We used the data for 14,312 AYA that examined recent and lifetime HIV testing from the 2017 MCIS. Our outcomes of interest were ever tested for HIV and recently tested for HIV. We examined the association between socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, marital status, education attainment, wealth status), stigma belief, exposure to media and HIV knowledge, and uptake of HIV testing using adjusted and unadjusted logistic regression models.Less than a quarter of the AYA (23.7%) had ever tested for HIV, and an even lower proportion (12.4%) tested in the year preceding the survey. More females (25.4%) compared to males (20.8%) had ever tested for HIV. Young people who were aged 20-24 years (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34-1.72), married (AOR 2.42, 95% CI 1.98-2.97), had higher educational attainment (AOR 5.85, 95% CI 4.39-7.81), and belonged to the wealthiest quintile (AOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.53-2.60), had higher odds of having ever tested for HIV compared to those aged 15-19 years, never married, had no formal education and belonged to the poorest wealth quintile. Also, those who had positive stigma belief towards people living with HIV (AOR 2.93, 95% CI 2.47-3.49), had higher HIV knowledge (AOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.11), and higher media exposure (AOR 1.64, 95% CI 1.36-1.97), had higher odds of having ever tested compared to those who had more negative stigma belief, had low knowledge of HIV and low media exposure.The HIV testing coverage among AYA in Nigeria is well below the national target of 95% indicated in the national HIV/AIDS strategic framework (2017-2021). Also, the low rate of HIV testing found in this study means realising the UNAIDS first 95 will require interventions targeting AYA. These interventions should focus on improving young people's knowledge of HIV, reducing negative stigma belief through media campaigns and increasing access to HIV testing through home-based testing and ""opt-out"" strategy at the point of care."
https://openalex.org/W3028575925,"Nitrogen is an important nutrient for plant growth and tuber quality of potato. Since potato crop requires high dose of N, improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of plant is an inevitable approach to minimize N fertilization. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize microRNAs (miRNAs) by small RNA sequencing in potato plants grown in aeroponic under two contrasting N (high and low) regimes. A total of 119 conserved miRNAs belonging to 41 miRNAs families, and 1002 putative novel miRNAs were identified. From total, 52 and 54 conserved miRNAs, and 404 and 628 putative novel miRNAs were differentially expressed in roots and shoots, respectively under low N stress. Of total 34,135 predicted targets, the gene ontology (GO) analysis indicated that maximum targets belong to biological process followed by molecular function and cellular component. Eexpression levels of the selected miRNAs and targets were validated by real time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. Two predicted targets of potential miRNAs (miR397 and miR398) were validated by 5’ RLM-RACE (RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends). In general, predicted targets are associated with stress-related, kinase, transporters and transcription factors such as universal stress protein, heat shock protein, salt-tolerance protein, calmodulin binding protein, serine-threonine protein kinsae, Cdk10/11- cyclin dependent kinase, amino acid transporter, nitrate transporter, sugar transporter, transcription factor, F-box family protein, and zinc finger protein etc. Our study highlights that miR397 and miR398 play crucial role in potato during low N stress management. Moreover, study provides insights to modulate miRNAs and their predicted targets to develop N-use efficient potato using transgenic/genome-editing tools in future."
https://openalex.org/W3025176977,"Across sensory areas, neural microcircuits consolidate streams of information into unified representations of the external world. In the carnivore visual cortex, where eye-specific inputs first converge, it has been posited that a single, binocularly aligned modular orientation representation develops independent of sensory experience. In this study of ferret visual cortex using in vivo calcium imaging, we find evidence for a different developmental process. Early in development, contralateral, ipsilateral, or binocular stimulation each yield well-organized modular representations of orientation that display features of mature cortex. However, comparison of these representations reveals considerable misalignment that is evident at both modular and cellular scales. Experience-dependent processes drive reorganization of these three representations toward a single binocularly aligned representation resembling the early binocular representation through shifts in cellular orientation preference. Thus, while orderly modular networks of orientation preference initially arise independent of visual experience, experience is critical for the alignment of these early representations."
https://openalex.org/W3026605731,"This research estimates the economic and epidemiological impact of youth suicide in countries with the highest human development index. The study relied on secondary analysis of suicide mortality data for youth aged between 15–24 years in countries with the highest human development index–Norway, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Singapore, Netherlands, Ireland, Canada and the United States. The impact of youth suicide is measured using years of life lost, years of productive life lost and present economic value of lost productivity. Costs are expressed in 2014 International dollars. Future earning potential is estimated using adjusted gross domestic product per capita, employment potential and historical trends in productivity and real interest rates. In 2014, an estimated 6,912 young people living in the most developed countries in the world lost their lives to suicide. These preventable deaths resulted in a loss of 406,730 years of life at a cost of $5.53 billion in lost economic income with the average cost of suicide estimated at $802,939. The United States stands out as a country with the most significant youth suicide problem accounting for 77% of total costs. Reducing youth suicide requires a multifaceted approach and significant investment by governments."
https://openalex.org/W3026790891,"The treatment of upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) accounts for the majority of antibiotic prescriptions in primary care, although an antibiotic therapy is rarely indicated. Non-clinical factors, such as time pressure and the perceived patient expectations are considered to be reasons for prescribing antibiotics in cases where they are not indicated. The improper use of antibiotics, however, can promote resistance and cause serious side effects. The aim of the study was to clarify whether the antibiotic prescription rate for infections of the upper respiratory tract can be lowered by means of a short (2 x 2.25h) communication training based on the MAAS-Global-D for primary care physicians.In total, 1554 primary care physicians were invited to participate in the study. The control group was formed from observational data. To estimate intervention effects we applied a combination of difference-in-difference (DiD) and statistical matching based on entropy balancing. We estimated a corresponding multi-level logistic regression model for the antibiotic prescribing decision of German primary care physicians for URTIs.Univariate estimates detected an 11-percentage-point reduction of prescriptions for the intervention group after the training. For the control group, a reduction of 4.7% was detected. The difference between both groups in the difference between the periods was -6.5% and statistically significant. The estimated effects were nearly identical to the effects estimated for the multi-level logistic regression model with applied matching. Furthermore, for the treatment of young women, the impact of the training on the reduction of antibiotic prescription was significantly stronger.Our results suggest that communication skills, implemented through a short communication training with the MAAS-Global-D-training, lead to a more prudent prescribing behavior of antibiotics for URTIs. Thereby, the MAAS-Global-D-training could not only avoid unnecessary side effects but could also help reducing the emergence of drug resistant bacteria. As a consequence of our study we suggest that communication training based on the MAAS-Global-D should be applied in the postgraduate training scheme of primary care physicians."
https://openalex.org/W3028221785,"Intramuscular fat content (IMF) is a complex trait influencing the technological and sensorial features of meat products and determining pork quality. Thus, we aimed at analyzing through RNA-sequencing the Semimembranosus muscle transcriptome of Italian Large White pigs to study the gene networks associated with IMF deposition. Two groups of samples were used; each one was composed of six unrelated pigs with extreme and divergent IMF content (0.67 ± 0.09% in low IMF vs. 6.81 ± 1.17% in high IMF groups) that were chosen from 950 purebred individuals. Paired-end RNA sequences were aligned to Sus scrofa genome assembly 11.1 and gene counts were analyzed using WGCNA and DeSeq2 packages in R environment. Interestingly, among the 58 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), several were related to primary cilia organelles (such as Lebercilin 5 gene), in addition to the genes involved in the regulation of cell differentiation, in the control of RNA-processing, and G-protein and ERK signaling pathways. Together with cilia-related genes, we also found in high IMF pigs an over-expression of the Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) gene, which in other animal species was found to be a regulator of ciliogenesis. Four WGCNA gene modules resulted significantly associated with IMF deposition: grey60 (P = 0.003), darkturquoise (P = 0.022), skyblue1 (P = 0.022), and lavenderblush3 (P = 0.030). The genes in the significant modules confirmed the results obtained for the DEGs, and the analysis with “cytoHubba” indicated genes controlling RNA splicing and cell differentiation as hub genes. Among the complex molecular processes affecting muscle fat depots, genes involved in primary cilia may have an important role, and the transcriptional reprogramming observed in high IMF pigs may be related to an FGF-related molecular cascade and to ciliogenesis, which in the literature have been associated with fibro-adipogenic precursor differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W3026387273,"Objective Damage to locus ceruleus neurons could play a part in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and multiple sclerosis because of impairment of the blood-brain barrier and enhanced neuroinflammation. The locus ceruleus has connections throughout the brain and spinal cord, so the characteristic widespread multifocal pathology in these disorders could be due to damage to different subsets of locus ceruleus neurons. Previous studies have shown that only certain locus ceruleus neurons accumulate the neurotoxic metal mercury. To find out if concentrations of other toxic metals or of essential trace elements also vary between individual locus ceruleus neurons, we used synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy on frozen sections of locus ceruleus neurons taken from people with multiple sclerosis, in whom the locus ceruleus is structurally intact. Materials and methods Paraffin embedded sections containing the locus ceruleus from seven people with multiple sclerosis were stained with autometallography that demonstrates accumulations of mercury, silver and bismuth. These were compared to maps of multiple elements obtained from frozen sections of locus ceruleus neurons from the same people using X-ray fluorescence microscopy. Neurons in the anterior pons from three of these donors were used as internal controls. Results Autometallography staining was observed in scattered locus ceruleus neurons from three of the seven donors. X-ray fluorescence microscopy showed variations among individual locus ceruleus neurons in levels of mercury, selenium, iron, copper, lead, bromine, and rubidium. Variations between donors of locus ceruleus neuronal average levels of mercury, iron, copper, and bromine were also detected. Anterior pons neurons contained no mercury, had varied levels of iron, and had lower copper levels than locus ceruleus neurons. Conclusions Individual human locus ceruleus neurons contain varying levels of toxic metals and essential trace elements. In contrast, most toxic metals are absent or at low levels in nearby anterior pons neurons. The locus ceruleus plays a role in numerous central nervous system functions, including maintaining the blood-brain-barrier and limiting neuroinflammation. Toxic metals, or alterations in essential trace metals within individual locus ceruleus neurons, could be one factor determining the non-random destruction of locus ceruleus neurons in normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and subsequently the sites of the widespread multifocal central nervous system pathology in these disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3028183229,"Spatial conservation prioritization is used worldwide for designing marine protected areas (MPA) that achieve set conservation objectives with minimal impacts to marine users. People involved in small-scale fisheries (SSF) may incur negative and disproportionate impacts from implementing MPAs, yet limited available data often restricts their representation in MPA planning. Using a Philippines case study, we focus here on the systematic design of a MPA network that aims to minimize and distribute costs equitably for SSF whilst achieving representation targets for biodiversity conservation. The objectives of the study are to: (1) document a participatory mapping approach for collecting SSF data for prioritization using the local knowledge of fishers; and (2) examine how the completeness and resolution of SSF data may affect prioritization outputs in terms of biodiversity representation, spatial efficiency, and distribution equity. In the data-poor region, we conducted participatory mapping workshops with fishers in 79 communities to collect data on the spatial distribution patterns of different SSF fisheries and communities, and employed remote sensing techniques to define coastal habitats, which were targeted for inclusion in MPAs. The datasets were integrated within the decision-support tool Marxan with Zones to develop three scenarios. The SSF data incorporated in each scenario varied based on their completeness (considered all fishing methods or only dominant methods) and resolution (fishing methods itemized by community or municipality). All scenarios derived MPA plans that met representation targets with similar area coverage. The outputs, however, varied in terms of distribution equity, measured by the distribution of opportunity costs (loss of fishing grounds) across different fisheries and communities. Scenarios that did not include minority fisheries or variations between communities, led to inequitable costs. These results highlight the need to incorporate detailed data on SSF at appropriate resolutions, and how this can be achieved through participatory approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3026973362,"The western tarnished plant bug, Lygus hesperus Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae) and the whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) are key hemipteran pests of numerous crop plants throughout the western United States and Mexico. Management in the U.S. currently relies on only a few insecticides and is threatened by the evolution of resistance. New chemistries or alternative management strategies are needed to reduce selection pressure on current insecticides and enhance control. Here, we investigated the bio-insecticidal toxicity of the French marigold, Tagetes patula Linnaeus (Asterales: Asteraceae), against both L. hesperus and B. tabaci. Assays indicated significantly reduced survival of both pest species on T. patula plants, and in diet incorporation assays containing aqueous and methanolic marigold foliar extracts. Mortality was concentration-dependent, indicating the presence of one or more extractable toxicants. These data suggest that T. patula plants have insecticidal constituents that might be identified and developed as novel alternatives to conventional chemical treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3027009022,"Background Social accountability approaches are increasingly being employed in low-resource settings to improve government services. In line with the continuous quality improvement (CQI) philosophy that quality is the product of a linked chain, collaborative social accountability approaches like the Community Score Card (CSC) aim to empower clients and frontline service providers to transform their own lives and hold public officials to account for state obligations. Despite being a critical focus of collaborative social accountability approaches, to our knowledge, a quantitative survey of health workers to understand the impact of these approaches on their self-reported responsibilities and service provision has not been conducted. To fill this gap, we carried out a quantitative survey with health workers to assess the CSC’s impact on health worker-reported service responsibilities and provision and complement women’s self-reports. Methods We evaluated the effect of the CSC on reproductive health-related outcomes using a cluster-randomized design in Ntcheu district, Malawi. We matched 10 pairs of health facilities and surrounding catchment communities; one from each pair was randomly assigned to the intervention and control arms. The intervention communities and health workers each completed 3–4 cycles of the CSC process by endline. We then surveyed all health workers in the 20 intervention and comparison sites at endline (n = 412) to estimate the intervention’s impact. Results Significantly (p < .05) more health workers in the CSC intervention areas compared to control areas reported responsibility for antenatal care, comprehensive antenatal care counseling, recording of the number of pregnant and postpartum women seen each month, and the average age of their last family planning client was younger. In addition, marginally significantly (p < .10) more health workers in treatment versus control areas report visiting women at their home at least once during their pregnancy. However, health worker-reported responsibility for HIV testing was significantly lower in intervention areas than in control. Conclusions The CSC aims to empower health workers to collaborate with the community and rest of the health system to identify and overcome the diverse and context-specific range of performance barriers they face. In doing so, it aims to support them to demand and ensure quality care for themselves from the health system so they can, in turn, deliver quality services to clients. Our results contribute to the evidence that the CSC may hold promise at improving service provision. While there is increasing evidence that collaborative social accountability approaches like the CSC are effective means to improving reproductive health-related service provision and outcomes in low-resource settings, additional research is needed."
https://openalex.org/W3027093556,"Given that a group of cities follows a scaling law connecting urban population with socio-economic or infrastructural metrics (transversal scaling), should we expect that each city would follow the same behavior over time (longitudinal scaling)? This assumption has important policy implications, although rigorous empirical tests have been so far hindered by the lack of suitable data. Here, we advance the debate by looking into the temporal evolution of the scaling laws for 5507 municipalities in Brazil. We focus on the relationship between population size and two urban variables, GDP and water network length, analyzing the time evolution of the system of cities as well as their individual trajectory. We find that longitudinal (individual) scaling exponents are city-specific, but they are distributed around an average value that approaches to the transversal scaling exponent when the data are decomposed to eliminate external factors, and when we only consider cities with a sufficiently large growth rate. Such results give support to the idea that the longitudinal dynamics is a micro-scaling version of the transversal dynamics of the entire urban system. Finally, we propose a mathematical framework that connects the microscopic level to global behavior, and, in all analyzed cases, we find good agreement between theoretical prediction and empirical evidence."
https://openalex.org/W3028314233,"Background Insight in hospitalizations in long-term childhood cancer survivors (CCS) is useful to understand the impact of long-term morbidity. We aimed to investigate hospitalization rates and underlying types of diagnoses in CCS compared to matched controls, and to investigate the determinants. Methods We linked 5,650 five-year CCS from the Dutch nationwide Dutch LATER cohort and 109,605 age- and sex-matched controls to the Dutch Hospital Discharge register, which contained detailed information on inpatient hospitalizations from 1995–2016. Relative hospitalization rates (RHRs) were calculated using a Poisson regression model. Adjusting for multiple hospitalizations per person via a Poisson model for generalized estimated equations, we investigated determinants for hospitalizations for all types of underlying diagnoses among CCS. Results CCS were twice as likely to be hospitalized as reference persons (hospitalization rate 178 and 78 per 1,000 person-years respectively; RHR 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.9–2.2). Although CCS had more hospitalizations for 17 types of underlying diagnoses, they were especially more likely to be hospitalized for endocrine conditions (RHR: 6.0, 95% CI 4.6–7.7), subsequent neoplasms (RHR: 5.6, 95% CI 4.6–6.7) and symptoms without underlying diagnoses (RHR: 5.2, 95% CI 4.6–5.8). For those types of underlying diagnoses, female sex and radiotherapy were determinants. Conclusion This study provides new insights in the high risk of hospitalizations for many types of underlying diagnoses in CCS and treatment related determinants. CCS are especially at high risk for hospitalizations for endocrine conditions, subsequent neoplasms and symptoms without an underlying diagnosis. This new knowledge is important for survivorship care and to identify possible preventable hospitalizations among CCS."
https://openalex.org/W3028486576,"Background Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the major source of active TB and is an obstacle to the strategy of World Health Organization to end TB by 2035. In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of prisons and they are conducive settings for the transmission of TB and could serve as the sources of infection to the general public. However, there is little data on the epidemiology of TB in prisons in Ethiopia. The objective of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of LTBI and evaluate associated risk factors in prisons in East Wollega Zone in western Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional design and systematic sampling technique were used to select 352 prisoners from a total of 2620 prisoners during the two months (May and June, 2019). The selected inmates were consented for their willingness to participate in the study. Thereafter, they were interviewed and 2ml of blood sample was collected from each prisoner and screened for LTBI using interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 25 and logistic regression was used to model the likelihood of LTBI occurrence and to identify risk factors associated with LTBI. Results The prevalence of LTBI was 51.2% (95% CI: 46.45–57%) and higher prevalence was recorded in males (53%) than in females (43.5%) although the difference was not significant. Prisoners whose age ≥45 years (AOR = 2.48, 95%CI, 1.04–5.9), who chewed khat (AOR = 2.27; 95% CI, 1.27–4.19), who were prisoned over a year (AOR = 1.81, 95%CI, 1.04–3.18) and who were in overcrowded pens (AOR = 1.91, 95% CI, 1.002–3.65) were at higher risk of LTBI. Conclusions The prevalence of LTBI in prisoners in West Wollega Zone of western Ethiopia was high and could serve as sources of infection to the public. Hence optimum handling of prisoners, and regular follow up and treatment of TB cases in prisons were recommended to minimize the burden of TB in the Zone."
https://openalex.org/W3027453803,"To facilitate functional investigation of the role of NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) and associated reactive oxygen species in cancer cell signaling, we report herein the development and characterization of a novel mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes the C-terminal region of the NOX1 protein. The antibody was validated in stable NOX1 overexpression and knockout systems, and demonstrates wide applicability for Western blot analysis, confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. We employed our NOX1 antibody to characterize NOX1 expression in a panel of 30 human colorectal cancer cell lines, and correlated protein expression with NOX1 mRNA expression and superoxide production in a subset of these cells. Although a significant correlation between oncogenic RAS status and NOX1 mRNA levels could not be demonstrated in colon cancer cell lines, RAS mutational status did correlate with NOX1 expression in human colon cancer surgical specimens. Immunohistochemical analysis of a comprehensive set of tissue microarrays comprising over 1,200 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue cores from human epithelial tumors and inflammatory disease confirmed that NOX1 is overexpressed in human colon and small intestinal adenocarcinomas, as well as adenomatous polyps, compared to adjacent, uninvolved intestinal mucosae. In contradistinction to prior studies, we did not find evidence of NOX1 overexpression at the protein level in tumors versus histologically normal tissues in prostate, lung, ovarian, or breast carcinomas. This study constitutes the most comprehensive histopathological characterization of NOX1 to date in cellular models of colon cancer and in normal and malignant human tissues using a thoroughly evaluated monoclonal antibody. It also further establishes NOX1 as a clinically relevant therapeutic target in colorectal and small intestinal cancer."

Then, the methods of GIS and the geographical detector are used to study the spatiotemporal evolution process and the influencing factors of Beijing hotel industry during 2003–2018. The results are as follows: a. During the period of 2003–2018, the hotel industry in Beijing maintained a high growth rate and had three growth peaks in 2008, 2010 and 2014. Meanwhile, major historical events, such as the Olympic Games had a significant influence on the development of the hotel industry. b. Between 2003 and 2018, the hotel industry in Beijing gradually developed from the centripetal agglomeration to aggregation + diffusion, and also from the single center to the multi-center. Besides, various hotels presented two characteristics of city orientation and scenic orientation. c. The natural geographical environment had shaped the overall pattern and characteristics of the spatial distribution of the hotel industry in Beijing, and the socio-economic factors such as commercial activities, public facilities, tourism services and traffic conditions significantly influenced the location selection of the hotel industry. Therefore, the urban center is the ideal area for the spatial layout of the hotel industry. d. Geographical detector research showed that the factors, such as administrative organs, road network density, leisure and recreational facilities, and companies have strong explanatory power for hotel location selection, which is an important reference index for hotels to select the micro location. This paper is a beneficial supplement to the existing research and has certain guiding significance for the sustainable development of Beijing hotel industry."
https://openalex.org/W3028566816,"Introduction Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are rare inherited metabolic diseases characterized by an abnormal accumulation of various toxic materials in the cells as a result of enzyme deficiencies leading to tissue and organ damage. Among clinical manifestations, cardiac diseases are particularly important in Pompe glycogen storage diseases (PD), in glycosphingolipidosis Fabry disease (FD), and mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS). Here, we evaluated the occurrence of aortopathy in knock out (KO) mouse models of three different LSDs, including PD, FD, and MPS IIIB. Methods We measured the aortic diameters in 15 KO male mice, 5 for each LSD: 5 GLA-/- mice for FD, 5 NAGLU-/- mice for MPS IIIB, 5 GAA-/- mice for PD, and 15 wild type (WT) mice: 5 for each strain. In order to compare the aortic parameters between KO and WT mice deriving from the same colonies, different diameters were echocardiographically measured: aortic annulus, aortic sinus, sino-tubular junction, ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending aorta. Storage material content and aortic defects of the KO mice were also analyzed by histology, when available. Results Compared to their correspondent WT mice: GAA-/- mice showed greater diameters of ascending aorta (1.61mm vs. 1.11mm, p-value = 0.01) and descending aorta (1.17mm vs 1.02mm, p-value 0.04); GLA-/- mice showed greater diameters of aortic annulus (1.35mm vs. 1.22mm, p-value = 0.01), sinus of Valsalva (1.6mm vs. 1.38mm, p-value<0.01), ascending aorta (1.57mm vs. 1.34mm, p-value<0.01), aortic arch (1.36mm vs. 1.22mm, p-value = 0.03) and descending aorta (1.29mm vs. 1.11mm, p-value<0.01); NAGLU-/- mice showed greater diameters of sinus of Valsalva (1.46mm vs. 1.31mm, p-value = 0.05), ascending aorta (1.42mm vs. 1.29mm, p-value<0.01), aortic arch (1.34mm vs. 1.28mm, p-value<0.01) and descending aorta (1.18mm vs. 1.1mm, p-value 0.01). Conclusions We evaluated for the first time the aortic diameters in 3 LSD mouse models and identified different aortopathy patterns, in concordance with recent human findings. Our results are relevant in view of using KO mouse models for efficiently testing the efficacy of new therapies on distinct cardiovascular aspects of LSDs."
https://openalex.org/W3026210083,"Fluorizoline (FLZ) binds to prohibitin-1 and -2 (PHB1/2), which are pleiotropic scaffold proteins known to affect signaling pathways involved in several intracellular processes. However, it is not yet clear how FLZ exerts its effect. Here, we show that exposure of three different human cancer cell lines to FLZ increases the phosphorylation of key translation factors, particularly of initiation factor 2 (eIF2) and elongation factor 2 (eEF2), modifications that inhibit their activities. FLZ also impaired signaling through mTOR complex 1, which also regulates the translational machinery, e.g. through the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-BP1. In line with these findings, FLZ potently inhibited protein synthesis. We noted that the first phase of this inhibition involves very rapid eEF2 phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by a dedicated Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, eEF2 kinase (eEF2K). We also demonstrate that FLZ induces a swift and marked rise in intracellular Ca2+ levels, likely explaining the effects on eEF2. Disruption of normal Ca2+ homeostasis can also induce endoplasmic reticulum stress, and our results suggest that induction of this stress response contributes to the increased phosphorylation of eIF2, likely because of activation of the eIF2-modifying kinase PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). We show that FLZ induces cancer cell death and that this effect involves contributions from the phosphorylation of both eEF2 and eIF2. Our findings provide important new insights into the biological effects of FLZ and thus the roles of PHBs, specifically in regulating Ca2+ levels, cellular protein synthesis, and cell survival.

Our findings provide important new insights into the biological effects of FLZ and thus the roles of PHBs, specifically in regulating Ca2+ levels, cellular protein synthesis, and cell survival. Dysregulation of protein synthesis (mRNA translation) plays an important roles in many diseases, in particular, cancers (1Robichaud N. Sonenberg N. Ruggero D. Schneider R.J. Translational control in cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2019; 11 (29959193): a03289610.1101/cshperspect.a032896Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The rate of protein synthesis can be modulated by changes in the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the initiation and elongation stages of the process of mRNA translation; these are termed eukaryotic initiation or elongation factors (eIFs, eEFs), respectively. For example, phosphorylation of the heterotrimer eIF2 on its α-subunit (eIF2α) leads to inhibition of translation initiation and thus general protein synthesis (2Wek R.C. Role of eIF2α kinases in translational control and adaptation to cellular stress.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10 (29440070): a03287010.1101/cshperspect.a032870Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Several kinases can perform this modification and are generally activated by stress conditions such as the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum or absence of a given amino acid. eEF2 also undergoes phosphorylation, which inhibits its activity and thus slows down translation elongation (3Kenney J.W. Moore C.E. Wang X. Proud C.G. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase, an unusual enzyme with multiple roles.Adv.Biol.Regul. 2014; 55 (24853390): 15-2710.1016/j.jbior.2014.04.003Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Carlberg U.

This event is catalyzed by a single kinase, eEF2 kinase (eEF2K), which is activated under certain stress conditions. Its activity is normally dependent on calcium ions that activate it through calmodulin, which binds to and stimulates eEF2K, thereby inhibiting translation elongation (5Ryazanov A.G. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of elongation factor 2.FEBS Lett. 1987; 214 (3569528): 331-33410.1016/0014-5793(87)80081-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Nairn A.C.

Several signaling pathways can regulate the phosphorylation of translation factors, including the mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and ERK (classical MAP kinase) pathways (7Proud C.G.

PHBs regulate the activation of RAF1 (C-RAF) by Ras, and consequently the oncogenic MEK/ERK/MNK/eIF4E pathway, which has multiple downstream effectors including components of the protein synthesis machinery. However, whether PHBs regulate mRNA translation by additional mechanisms remains unexplored. Several classes of PHB ligands displaying diverse profiles of pharmacological activities, such as FL3, Mel6, Mel41, JI130, and fluorizoline (FLZ), have been reported. Because the genetic deletion of PHB is lethal, these ligands are invaluable to examine the cellular function of PHBs. FL3 binds to PHBs to block the activation of C-RAF (Raf-1) and KRAS (22Polier G.

Here we built upon earlier data indicating that PHBs (in particular PHB2) interact with certain components of the translational (protein synthesis) machinery, including ribosomal proteins, or kinases that act upon them (RRID:SCR_018711), and with some signaling proteins involved in the regulation of translation such as ERK (MAP kinase), the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) or mTORC1. We now show that FLZ induces the phosphorylation of two key components of the protein synthetic machinery, initiation factor eIF2 and elongation factor eEF2. The phosphorylation of each of these general translation factors inhibits its function. Consistent with this, FLZ induces the inhibition of overall protein synthesis. FLZ also elicits a marked increase in intracellular calcium ion levels, which activate eEF2 kinase and evoke endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which causes enhanced phosphorylation of eIF2. FLZ also inhibits of mTORC1 signaling and thus affects S6K and eIF4E-BP1, all of which effects likely contribute to the inhibition of overall protein synthesis caused by FLZ. FLZ also induces cell death, and this appears to involve the phosphorylation of both eEF2 and eIF2. Our data substantially extend understanding of the physiological roles of PHBs. We began by testing a range of PHB-binding compounds for their effects, in A549 lung carcinoma cells, on translation factors or signaling pathways linked to them. As shown in Fig. 1A, FLZ caused a very marked increase in the phosphorylation of eEF2 rapidly by 15 min, whereas the other compounds had little or no effect, even after 60-min exposure. By 15 min, FLZ also elicited a rise in the phosphorylation of the AMPK, a metabolic sensor which can activate eEF2K (34Horman S. Browne G.J. Krause U. Patel J.V. Vertommen D. Bertrand L. Lavoinne A.

The effect on phosphorylated (P)-eEF2 occurred at concentrations lower than 20 μM, but the increased phosphorylation of AMPK did not (Fig. S1A), suggesting the change in eEF2 phosphorylation was not because of activation of AMPK. Further experiments to test the role of eEF2K are described below. At 60 min, FLZ did not exert a noticeable effect on other proteins tested, apart from causing a small shift in the electrophoretic behavior of 4E-BP1 toward faster-migrating species, which correspond to less phosphorylated variants of this protein (cf. decrease in signal for P–Ser-65 in 4E-BP1 (Fig. 1A). This suggests that FLZ causes mild impairment of mTORC1 signaling, which was confirmed by a large decrease in the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, a direct substrate for mTORC1 (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1B). However, little if any change was seen for S6, a substrate for p70 S6K (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1B). A slight increase in the phosphorylation of ERK was consistently observed (Fig. 1A), which likely accounts for the small rise in the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF4E, which is linked to ERK signaling via the eIF4E kinases, the MNKs (9Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. Mitogen-activated kinases activate the serine/threonine kinases Mnk1 and Mnk2.EMBO J. 1997; 16 (9155017): 1909-192010.1093/emboj/16.8.1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 36Wang X.

When treatment with FLZ was extended to 120 min, it was clear that the increased phosphorylation of eEF2 was sustained (Fig. 1B and Fig. S2, A–C) and that FLZ also induced, albeit more slowly, the phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 1B). Activation of AMPK (as judged from P-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) levels) declined by the final time point (Fig. 1B). The FLZ-induced rise in the phosphorylation of eEF2 was very fast, being evident as early as 1 min (Fig. S2A). Given these striking effects of FLZ on phosphorylation of regulators of mRNA translation in A549 cells, we considered it important to assess its effects in other cancer cell lines. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells FLZ also increased the phosphorylation of eEF2 and eIF2 (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2, D and E), but had little or no effect on P-ERK or P-eIF4E. Other compounds tested had little, if any, effect on the proteins studied in MDA-MB-231 cells, apart from some activation of ERK by FL3 (and FLZ) (Fig. S3A). The FLZ-induced phosphorylation of eEF2 was transient, being maximum at 30-60 min (Fig. 1C and Fig. S2, D and E); eIF2α phosphorylation again rose markedly but more slowly; it was still elevated at 120 min (Fig. 1, B–D). FLZ had little effect on the AKT/mTORC1 pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells, apart from a minor inhibitory effect on P-AKT (Ser-473), a substrate for mTORC2 (Fig. S3B). FL3 but not the other PHB ligands inhibited the phosphorylation of S6K1 (Fig. S3, A and B), a readout of mTORC1 activity in MDA-MB-231 cells, concomitant with a reduction in the phosphorylated levels of eEF2 (Fig. S3, A and B). A broadly similar pattern of changes in the phosphorylation of eEF2 and eIF2 was also observed in a third cell line, cervical cancer HeLa cells (Fig. 1D and Fig. S2, F and G). These data show that FLZ rapidly enhances the phosphorylation of eIF2 and eEF2 in all three cell lines, with the effect on P-eEF2 being considerably faster (already higher at 5 min in all three lines) than the rise in P-eIF2 (evident by 30 min). Because FLZ increases the phosphorylation of eIF2α and eEF2 and these modifications impair the functions in the elongation and initiation phases of mRNA translation (2Wek R.C. Role of eIF2α kinases in translational control and adaptation to cellular stress.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10 (29440070): a03287010.1101/cshperspect.a032870Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 37Proud C.G. Control of the elongation phase of protein synthesis.in: Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational control of gene expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 719-739Google Scholar), we asked whether FLZ affected the rate of protein synthesis. To do this, we employed the widely used SunSET assay (38Schmidt E.K. Clavarino G. Ceppi M. Pierre P. SUnSET, a nonradioactive method to monitor protein synthesis.Nat. Methods. 2009; 6 (19305406): 275-27710.1038/nmeth.1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), whereby cells are incubated with puromycin, which becomes incorporated into newly made proteins. Proteins are then resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-puromycin antibody. The signal observed reports newly made proteins. The assay was configured such that puromycin was added after a 15- or 45-min pretreatment of the cells with FLZ to allow us to assess effects of protein synthesis over two different time windows, 15–30 or 45–60 min. FLZ modestly reduced puromycin incorporation over the 15- to 30-min interval in A549, MDA-MB-231 or HeLa cells (Fig. 2, A–C) and more markedly decreased it over the 45- to 60-min time period. Indeed, when corrected for nonspecific labeling by comparing with the signal seen in the presence of an inhibitor of translation, cycloheximide (CHX), net puromycin incorporation was very low over the 45- to 60-min time period in FLZ-treated A549 or HeLa cells (Fig. 2, A–C). Thus, FLZ inhibits protein synthesis and does so more strongly at time points later than the initial increase in eEF2 phosphorylation. The timing of this inhibition correlates with the increased phosphorylation of eIF2, which is well-known to cause a general inhibition of translation (2Wek R.C. Role of eIF2α kinases in translational control and adaptation to cellular stress.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2018; 10 (29440070): a03287010.1101/cshperspect.a032870Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This suggested that the inhibition of protein synthesis caused by FLZ was not only, or not primarily, because of the rise in P-eEF2. To assess whether the inhibition of protein synthesis caused by FLZ did indeed involve the phosphorylation of eEF2, we made use of MDA-MB-231 cells in which the gene for eEF2K had been knocked out (39Xie J. Shen K. Lenchine R.V. Gethings L.A. Trim P.J. Snel M.F. Zhou Y. Kenney J.W. Kamei M. Kochetkova M. Wang X. Proud C.G. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase upregulates the expression of proteins implicated in cell migration and cancer cell metastasis.Int. J. Cancer. 2018; 142 (29235102): 1865-187710.1002/ijc.31210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); in such cells, as expected, no phosphorylation of eEF2 was observed (Fig. 2D). When compared with WT MDA-MB-231 cells, it was evident that the rapid phase of FLZ-induced inhibition was essentially lost, whereas the inhibition seen at later times was hardly affected (Fig. 2, E and F; compare quantification with that in Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data are consistent with the conclusion that the rapid phase of the inhibition of protein synthesis by FLZ involves the phosphorylation of eEF2, and the longer-term inhibition (at 45-60 min) involves additional effects, which likely include the increased phosphorylation of eIF2α and/or accumulation of 4E-BPs (see below). Lastly, we noted that the early phase of the inhibition of protein synthesis caused by FLZ was stronger in HeLa cells than in A549 cells (Fig. 2, A and C). Interestingly, direct comparison on the same immunoblots showed that FLZ induced higher levels of P-eEF2 in HeLa than in A549 cells, which is consistent with eEF2 phosphorylation being largely responsible for the rapid inhibition of translation by FLZ in HeLa cells but playing a lesser role in A549 cells (Fig. S4). FLZ can also inhibit 4E-BP1 phosphorylation over longer (i.e. 60 min) periods of time (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1), dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 associates with eIF4E and hence interferes with cap-dependent translation. It was therefore important to determine whether FLZ affected 4E-BP1–eIF4E binding. There was an increase in the signal for total 4E-BP1 in response to FLZ in A549 cells, which probably reflects an accumulation of dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 (cf. decreased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr-37/46) (Fig. 3A). Dephosphorylated 4E-BP1 is stabilized by its association with eIF4E (40Yanagiya A. Suyama E. Adachi H. Svitkin Y.V. Aza-Blanc P. Imataka H. Mikami S. Martineau Y. Ronai Z.A. Sonenberg N. Translational homeostasis via the mRNA cap-binding protein, eIF4E.Mol.

As shown by m7GTP affinity chromatography, although FLZ did not alter the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E at 15 min, it did increase 4E-BP1-eIF4E binding after 60 min (Fig. 3, B–D). However, FLZ did not alter levels of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation or total 4E-BP1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. S3, C and D). These data imply that inhibition of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and increased binding of this protein to eIF4E are likely to contribute to the inhibitory effect of FLZ, at least in A549 cells, on the late (60 min) but not the rapid (15 min"

To clarify the importance of ERECTA signaling for the development of soybean (Glycine max), we expressed the dominant-negative ERECTA gene from Arabidopsis thaliana that is truncated in the kinase domain (AtΔKinase). Expression of AtΔKinase in soybean resulted in the short stature, reduced number of leaves, reduced leaf surface area and enhanced branching in the transgenic plants. The transgenic AtΔKinase soybean plants exhibited increased tolerance to water deficit stress due to the reduction of total leaf area and reduced transpiration compared to the wild-type plants. Production of seeds in AtΔKinase lines was higher compared to wild type at regular conditions of cultivation and after exposure to drought stress. Transgenic seedlings expressing AtΔKinase were also able to withstand salt stress better than the wild-type. Established results demonstrated the significance of native soybean genes (GmER and GmERL) in development and stress response of soybean, and suggested that the truncated ERECTA gene of Arabidopsis thaliana can be used to manipulate the growth and stress response of different crop species."
https://openalex.org/W3026303086,"Introduction Atorvastatin-80mg/day and Rosuvastatin-40mg/day are the commonest high-dose statin (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors) regimes for post-PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Interventions) patients to lower (by ≥50%) blood low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Dearth of conclusive evidence from developing world, regarding overall safety, tolerability and comparative effectiveness (outcome/safety/tolerability/endothelial inflammation control) of Rosuvastatin over Atorvastatin in high-dose, given its higher cost, called for an overall and comparative assessment among post-PCI patients in a tertiary cardiac-care hospital of Kolkata, India. Methods A record-based non-concurrent cohort study was conducted involving 942 post-PCI patients, aged 18–75 years, on high-dose statin for three months and followed up for ≥one year. Those on Atorvastatin-80mg (n = 321) and Rosuvastatin-40mg (n = 621) were compared regarding outcome (death/non-fatal myocardial infarction: MI/repeated hospitalization/target-vessel revascularisation/control of LDL and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein: hsCRP), safety (transaminitis/myopathy/myalgia/myositis/rhabdomyolysis), tolerability (gastroesophageal reflux disease: GERD/gastritis) and inflammation control adjusting for socio-demographics, tobacco-use, medications and comorbidities using SAS-9.4. Results Groups varied minimally regarding distribution of age/gender/tobacco-use/medication/comorbidity/baseline (pre-PCI) LDL and hs-CRP level. During one-year post-PCI follow up, none died. One acute MI and two target vessel revascularizations occurred per group. Repeated hospitalization for angina/stroke was 2.18% in Atorvastatin group vs. 2.90% in Rosuvastatin group. At three-months follow up, GERD/Gastritis (2.18% vs 4.83%), uncontrolled hs-CRP (22.74% vs 31.08%) and overall non-tolerability (4.67% vs. 8.21%) were lower for Atorvastatin group. Multiple logistic regression did show that compared to Atorvastatin-80mg, Rosuvastatin-40mg regime had poorer control of hs-CRP (A3OR = 1.45,p = 0.0202), higher (A3OR = 2.07) adverse effects, poorer safety profile (A3OR = 1.23), higher GERD/Gastritis (A3OR = 1.50) and poorer overall tolerability (A3OR = 1.50). Conclusion Post-PCI high dose statins were effective, safe and well-tolerated. High dose Rosuvastatin as compared to high dose Atorvastatin were similar in their clinical efficacy. Patients treated with Atrovastatin had significantly lower number of patients with hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein)/C-reactive protein (CRP) level beyond comparable safe limit and relatively better tolerated as opposed to Rosuvastatin-40mg.Thus given the lower price, Atorvastatin 80mg/day appeared to be more cost-effective. A head-to-head cost-effectiveness as well as efficacy trial may be the need of the hour."
https://openalex.org/W3026431821,"Background We developed, and pilot tested a family focused intervention Sammanit Jeevan “Living with Dignity” to reduce gender-based violence by husbands, change harmful social and gender norms and improve the economic conditions of women through young married women-led income generating activities (IGAs). Methods We conducted a modified interrupted time series study and qualitative research to evaluate the intervention in two migrant communities in Baglung district, Nepal. We enrolled young married women, their husbands and in-laws from 100 families. 200 women and 157 men completed questionnaires before the programme, and 6, 12 and 18 months afterwards. 18 in-depth interviews were conducted before the programme and 6 and 12 months later. We analysed the data for trends. Results The intervention positively impacted young married women’s economic conditions, exposure to violence and changed inequitable gender attitudes. Some positive outcomes were observed among older women and men. Young women’s past month earnings (35.0% - 81.3%, β = 0.11, p-value<0.001) and savings (29.0% - 80.2%, β = 0.14, p-value<0.001) more than doubled over time. Young women experienced much less past year physical IPV over time (10% - 4.4%, β = -0.08, p-value = 0.077). They also perceived that their mothers-in-law were less cruel (mean 9.0–8.6, β = -0.03, p-value = 0.035). Improvements were observed in young women’s individual (mean 44.4–43.3, β = -0.04, p-value = 0.297) and perceived community gender attitudes (mean 54.4–51.4, β = -0.19, p-value<0.001) and they reported that their husbands were less controlling (mean 17.5–16.1, β = -007, p-value<0.001). These changes were supported by qualitative findings. Conclusions Whilst caution is needed in attributing the effect due to lack of control arm, the results suggest that with adequate time and seed funding, Sammanit Jeevan enabled considerable income generation, a strengthened the position of young women in the households and it reduced their exposure to violence in this community. It warrants further research to optimise its impact."
https://openalex.org/W3028218322,"Objectives The objectives of the study were to estimate the prevalence of different clinical signs of trachoma and identify possible factors associated with TF. Methodology Following the approval of the study protocol by the ethics committee, a cross-sectional study was conducted in Vaupés, a department of the Colombian Amazon, between the years 2012 and 2013 in two districts. Based on the records obtained from a standardized format for the clinical evaluation of the participants and the factors associated with follicular trachoma, an excel database was built and debugged, which was analyzed using IBM SPSS, Statistics Version 23 and Stata STATA (Version 14, 2015, StataCorp LLC, Texas, USA). Results The records of 13,091 individuals was collected from 216 rural indigenous communities, of which 12,080 were examined (92.3%); 7,274 in the Western and 4,806 in the Eastern districts. A prevalence of trachomatous inflammation–follicular (TF) of 21.7% (n = 599; 95% CI 20.2–23.3) in the Western and 24.9% (n = 483; 95% CI 23.1–26.9) in the Eastern district was found in children aged 1 to 9 years. Regarding trachomatous trichiasis (TT), 77 cases were found, of which 14 belonged to the Western district (prevalence 0.3%, CI 95% 0.2–0.5) and 63 to the Eastern district (1.8%, CI 95% 1.4–2.4). Children aged between 1 to 9 years were significantly more likely to have TF when there was the presence of secretions on the face (OR: 3.2; 95% CI: 2.6–3.9). Conclusions Trachoma is a public health problem in Vaupés that requires the implementation of the SAFE strategy (S = Surgery, A = Antibiotics, F = Face Washing, E = Environment) in the Eastern and Western districts, for at least 3 consecutive years, in accordance with WHO recommendations."

However, the mechanisms that connect hearing impairments and cognitive decline are still unknown. Here we propose that a suprathreshold auditory-nerve impairment is associated with cognitive decline and brain atrophy.audiological, neuropsychological, and brain structural 3-Tesla MRI data were obtained from elders with different levels of hearing loss recruited in the ANDES cohort. The amplitude of waves I (auditory nerve) and V (midbrain) from auditory brainstem responses were measured at 80 dB nHL. We also calculated the ratio between wave V and I as a proxy of suprathreshold brainstem function.we included a total of 101 subjects (age: 73.5 ± 5.2 years (mean ± SD), mean education: 9.5 ± 4.2 years, and mean audiogram thresholds (0.5-4 kHz): 25.5 ± 12.0 dB HL). We obtained reliable suprathreshold waves V in all subjects (n = 101), while replicable waves I were obtained in 92 subjects (91.1%). Partial Spearman correlations (corrected by age, gender, education and hearing thresholds) showed that reduced suprathreshold wave I responses were associated with thinner temporal and parietal cortices, and with slower processing speed as evidenced by the Trail-Making Test-A and digit symbol performance. Non-significant correlations were obtained between wave I amplitudes and other cognitive domains.These results evidence that reduced suprathreshold auditory nerve responses in presbycusis are associated with slower processing speed and brain structural changes in temporal and parietal regions."
https://openalex.org/W3027328916,"Oral anticoagulant (OAC) therapy has been the main treatment approach for stroke prevention for decades. Warfarin is the most widely prescribed OAC in the United States, but is difficult to manage due to variability in dose requirements across individuals. Pharmacogenomics may mitigate risk concerns related to warfarin use by fostering the opportunity to facilitate individualized medicine approaches to warfarin treatment (e.g., genome-guided dosing). While various economic evaluations exist examining the cost-effectiveness of pharmacogenomics testing for warfarin, few observational studies exist to support these studies, with even fewer using genotype as the main exposure of interest. We examined a cohort of individuals initiating warfarin therapy between 2004 and 2017 and examined bleeding and cost outcomes for the year following initiation using Mayo Clinic’s billing and administrative data, as well the Mayo Clinic Rochester Cost Data Warehouse. Analyses included descriptive summaries, comparison of characteristics across exposure groups, reporting of crude outcomes, and multivariate analyses. We included N = 1,143 patients for analyses. Just over a third of our study population (34.9%) carried a warfarin-sensitive phenotype. Sensitive individuals differed in their baseline characteristics by being of older age and having a higher number of comorbid conditions; myocardial infarction, diabetes, and cancer in particular. The occurrence of bleeding events was not significantly different across exposure groups. No significant differences across exposure groups existed in either the likelihood of incurring all-cause healthcare costs or in the magnitude of those costs. Warfarin-sensitive individuals were no more likely to utilize cardiovascular-related healthcare services; however, they had lower total and inpatient cardiovascular-related costs compared to warfarin-insensitive patients. No significant differences existed in any other categories of costs. We found limited evidence that warfarin-sensitive individuals have different healthcare spending than warfarin-insensitive individuals. Additional real-world studies are needed to support the traditional economic evaluations currently existing in the literature."
https://openalex.org/W3026296954,"Insight into motivational processes may be gained by examining measures of willingness to exert effort for rewards, which have been linked to neuropsychiatric symptoms of anhedonia and apathy. However, while much work has focused on the development of models of motivation based on classic tasks of externally-generated levels of effort for reward, there has been less focus on the question of self-generated motivation or volition. We developed a task that aims to capture separate measures of self-generated and externally-generated motivation, with two task variants for physical and cognitive effort, and sought to test and validate this measure in two populations of healthy volunteers (N = 27 and N = 28). Similar to previous reports, a sigmoid function represented a better overall fit to the effort-reward data than a linear or Weibull model. Individual sigmoid function shapes were governed by two free parameters: bias (the amount of reward needed for effort initiation) and reward insensitivity (the amount of increase in reward needed to accelerate effort expenditure). For both physical and cognitive effort, bias was higher in the self-generated condition, indicating reduced self-generated volitional effort initiation, compared to externally-generated effort initiation, across effort domains. Bias against initial effort initiation in the self-generated condition was related to a specific dimensional measure of anticipatory anhedonia. For physical effort only, reward insensitivity was also higher in the self-generated condition compared to the externally-generated motivation condition, indicating lower self-generated effort acceleration. This work provides a novel objective measure of self-generated motivation that may provide insights into mechanisms of anhedonia and related symptoms."

https://openalex.org/W3027658893,"Much work has been done to find markers of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that distinguish them from the tumor bulk cells and normal cells. Recent CSC research has applied the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) concept. In this study, we investigated the expression of a panel of iPSC markers in primary colon adenocarcinoma (CA)-derived cell lines.Expression of iPSC markers by CA-derived primary cell lines was interrogated using immunocytochemistry, western blotting and RT-qPCR. The stem cell function of these cells was then assessed in vitro using differentiation and tumorsphere assays.Expression of iPSC markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4 and c-MYC was more widespread in high-grade CA (HGCA) cell lines than low-grade CA (LGCA) cell lines, as demonstrated by western blotting and RT-qPCR. These cells could be induced to differentiate down the three embryonic lineages. Cells derived from HGCA were more capable of forming tumorspheres than those derived from LGCA. EpCAM sorting revealed that a population enriched for EpCAMHigh cells formed larger tumorspheres than EpCAMLow cells. Pluripotency markers, SSEA4 and TRA-1-60, were co-expressed by a small subpopulation of cells that also co-expressed SOX2 in 75% and OCT4 in 50% of the cell lines.CA-derived primary cell lines contain tumorsphere-forming cells which express key pluripotency genes and can differentiate down 3 embryonic lineages, suggesting a pluripotent CSC-like phenotype. There appear to be two iPSC-like subpopulations, one with high EpCAM expression which forms larger tumorspheres than another with low EpCAM expression. Furthermore, these cells can be characterized based on iPSC marker expression, as we have previously demonstrated in the original CA tumor tissues."
https://openalex.org/W3028014901,"The marine phase of anadromous Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is the least known yet one of the most crucial with regards to population persistence. Recently, declines in many salmon populations in eastern Canada have been attributed to changes in the conditions at sea, thus reducing their survival. However, marine survival estimates are difficult to obtain given that many individuals spend multiple winters in the ocean before returning to freshwater to spawn; therefore, multiple parameters need to be estimated. We develop a model that uses an age-structured projection matrix which, coupled with yearly smolt and return abundance estimates, allows us to resample a distribution of matrices weighted by how close the resulting return estimates match the simulated returns, using a sample-importance-resampling algorithm. We test this model by simulating a simple time series of salmon abundances, and generate six different scenarios of varying salmon life histories where we simulate data for one-sea-winter (1SW)-dominated and non-1SW dominated populations, as well as scenarios where the proportion returning as 1SW is stable or highly variable. We find that our model provides reasonable estimates of marine survival for the first year at sea (S1), but highly uncertain estimates of proportion returning as 1SW (Pr) and survival in the second year at sea (S2). Our exploration of variable scenarios suggests the model is able to detect temporal trends in S1 for populations that have a considerable 1SW component in the returns; the ability of the model to detect trends in S1 diminishes as the proportion of two-sea-winter fish increases. Variability in the annual proportion of fish returning as 1SW does not seem to impact model accuracy. Our approach provides an instructive stepping-stone towards a model that can be applied to empirical abundance estimates of Atlantic salmon, and anadromous fishes in general, and therefore improve our knowledge of the marine phase of their life cycles as well as examining spatial and temporal trends in their variability."
https://openalex.org/W3028425613,"Speakers occasionally produce verbs that agree with an element that is not the subject, a so-called 'attractor'; likewise, comprehenders occasionally fail to notice agreement errors when the verb agrees with the attractor. Cross-linguistic studies converge in showing that attraction is modulated by the hierarchical position of the attractor in the sentence structure. We report two experiments exploring the link between structural position and memory representations in attraction. The method used is innovative in two respects: we used jabberwocky materials to control for semantic influences and focus on structural agreement processing, and we used a Speed-Accuracy Trade-off (SAT) design combined with a memory probe recognition task, as classically used in list memorization tasks. SAT enabled the joint measurement of retrieval speed and retrieval accuracy of subjects and attractors in sentences that typically elicit attraction errors. Experiment 1 first established that attraction arises in jabberwocky sentences, to a similar extent and showing structure-dependency effects, as in natural sentences. Experiment 2 showed a close alignment between the attraction profiles found in Experiment 1 and memory parameters. Results support a content-addressable architecture of memory representations for sentences in which nouns' accessibility depends on their syntactic position, while subjects are kept in the focus of attention."

Mean IMT values were averaged from mean values of both sides. Associations between early life factors and adult IMT were analyzed using multivariable linear regression models with adjustment for potential confounders.Adult mean IMT was 0.56mm, SD 0.03, (range: 0.41 mm-0.78 mm). Maternal age at child birth was of relevance for adult IMT, which was sex specific: Advanced maternal age at child birth was associated with an increased adult IMT among female offspring only (β 0.03, SE 0.009 mm/decade, P = 0.003), this was not affected by adult waist circumference, BMI or blood pressure. Other early life factors were not relevant for IMT levels in males and females.This study suggests that advanced maternal age at child birth is of prospective relevance for adult IMT levels in a healthy German population and this association may be of adverse relevance for females only."
https://openalex.org/W3026305407,"The oriental red spider mite, Eutetranychus orientalis (Klein) is a major pest of citrus in many countries including Saudi Arabia (SA). The morphological variations among the different populations of E. orientalis were reported. In the present study, phenotypic variations based on 40 different morphological characteristics were evaluated in 10 E. orientalis populations collected from different hosts and regions of SA. Further, ITS2-rDNA sequences were used to confirm the identity of these phenotypically varying populations. Phenotypic variations in all populations were found in the shape and length of dorsal setae, striation pattern between setae d1 and e1, and leg chaetotaxy. The rDNA sequence analysis of these morphologically varying populations resulted in 10 different ITS2 Saudi haplotypes. The phenotypic and genetic variations were more related to the host plants rather than their geographic distribution. The E. orientalis population collected from Phoenix dactylifera was phenotypically distinct and genetically divergent. The populations collected from citrus species were also more phenotypically and genetically related to each other than to populations collected from non-citrus host plants. The haplotypes recovered from Ziziphus sp., Morus sp., and Azadirecta indica from different regions were grouped in the same sub-clade. Further, the ITS2 haplotypes of Saudi E. orientalis recovered from Citrus reticulata from Riyadh and Al Ula were 100% identical to the ITS2 haplotypes recovered from Citrus sp. from Israel. It is concluded that phenotypic variations exist among different populations of E. orientalis inhabiting different host plants. This species should be identified carefully by considering phenotypic intraspecific variations."

Brazilian government recommendations have focused screening on the female population aged from 25 to 64 years old. In this study, we examined the incidence and mortality rates of invasive cervical cancer lesions and the incidence rates of in situ precancerous cervical lesions, aiming to calculate their respective statistics over time in a mid-sized Brazilian city, Aracaju. The 1996-2015 database from the Aracaju Cancer Registry and Mortality Information System was used to calculate age standardized rates for all invasive cervical tumors (International code of diseases, ICD-10: C53) and preinvasive cervical lesions (ICD-10: D06) in the following patient age ranges; ≤ 24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64 and ≥ 65 years old. We identified 1,030 cancer cases, 1,871 in situ lesions and 334 deaths. Using the Joinpoint Regression Program, we calculated the annual percentage incidence changes and our analyses show that cervical cancer incidence decreased up to 2008, increased up to 2012 and decreased again thereafter, a significant trend in all age groups from 25 years. The incidence of precursor lesions increased from 1996 to 2005 and has since decreased, a result significant in all age groups until 64 years. Cervical cancer mortality has decreased by 3.8% annually and trend analysis indicates that Pap smears have been effective in decreasing cancer incidence and mortality. However, recent trends shown here show a decreasing incidence of in situ lesions and may indicate either a real decrease or incomplete catchment. Thus, we suggest health policies should be re-considered and include sufficient screening and HPV vaccination strategies to avoid cervical cancer resurgence in the population."
https://openalex.org/W3027043850,"The use of instruments originally developed for measuring gambling activity in younger populations may not be appropriate in older age individuals. The aim of this study was to examine the presence of problematic and disordered gambling in seniors aged 50 or over, and study the reliability and validity properties of the SOGS (a screening measure to identify gambling related problems). Two independent samples were recruited: a clinical group of n = 47 patients seeking treatment at a Pathological Gambling Outpatient Unit, and a population-based group of n = 361 participants recruited from the same geographical area. Confirmatory factor analysis verified the bifactor structure for the SOGS with two correlated underlying dimensions [measuring the impact of gambling on the self primarily (Cronbach’s alpha α = 0.87) or on both the self and others also (α = 0.82)], and a global dimension of gambling severity (also with excellent internal consistency, α = 0.90). The SOG obtained excellent accuracy/validity for identifying gambling severity based on the DSM-5 criteria (area under the ROC curve AUC = 0.97 for discriminating disordered gambling and AUC = 0.91 for discriminating problem gambling), and good convergent validity with external measures of gambling (Pearson’s correlation R = 0.91 with the total number of DSM-5 criteria for gambling disorder, and R = 0.55 with the debts accumulated due to gambling) and psychopathology (R = 0.50, 0.43 and 0.44 with the SCL-90R depression, anxiety and GSI scales). The optimal cutoff point for identifying gambling disorder was 4 (sensitivity Se = 92.3% and specificity Sp = 98.6%) and 2 for identifying problem gambling (Se = 78.8% and Sp = 96.7%). This study provides empirical support for the reliability and validity of the SOGS for assessing problem gambling in elders, and identifies two specific factors that could help both research and clinical decision-making, based on the severity and consequences of the gambling activity."
https://openalex.org/W3026188696,"Effective biological treatment of marine wastewater is not well-known. Accumulation of nitrogen and phosphorus from land-based effluent is a crucial cause of red-tide in marine systems. The purpose of the study is to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus in marine wastewater with a pilot plant-scale sequencing batch reactor (SBR) system by using marine sediment as eco-friendly and effective biological materials, and elucidate which bacterial strains in sludge from marine sediment influence the performance of SBR. By applying eco-friendly high efficiency marine sludge (eco-HEMS), the treatment performance was 15 m3 d-1 of treatment amount in 4.5 m3 of the reactor with the average removal efficiency of 89.3% for total nitrogen and 94.9% for total phosphorus at the optimal operation condition in summer. Moreover, the average removal efficiency was 84.0% for total nitrogen and 88.3% for total phosphorus in winter although biological treatment efficiency in winter is generally lower due to bacterial lower activity. These results were revealed by the DNA barcoding analysis of 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing of samples from the sludge in winter. The comparative analysis of the bacterial community composition in sludge at the high efficiency of the system showed the predominant genera Psychromonas (significantly increased to 45.6% relative abundance), Vibrio (13.3%), Gaetbulibacter (5.7%), and Psychroserpens (4.3%) in the 4 week adaptation after adding marine sediment, suggesting that those predominant bacteria influenced the treatment performance in winter."
https://openalex.org/W3027216774,"Stress-associated proteins (SAPs) are favorable targets to improve stress tolerance in plants, owing to their roles in developmental processes and stress responses. However, the role of SAPs and the molecular mechanisms by which they regulate plant stress responses remain poorly understood. Previously, it was reported that LmSAP expression was upregulated by various abiotic stressors in Lobularia maritima, and that transgenic tobacco lines with constitutively expressed LmSAPΔA20 and LmSAPΔA20-ΔAN1 showed dwarf phenotypes due to the deficiency of cell elongation under salt and osmotic stresses. In this study, we examined the function of A20 domain in the GA pathway in response to abiotic stresses. Transient expression of acGFP-LmSAPΔA20 and acGFP-LmSAPΔA20-ΔAN1 in onion epidermal cells demonstrated that these fused proteins were localized in the nucleo-cytoplasm. However, the truncated form acGFP-LmSAPΔAN1 was localized in the nucleus. Moreover, comparison of native and truncated LmSAP showed dramatic structural changes caused by the deletion of the A20 domain, leading to loss of function and localization. Interestingly, overexpression LmSAP and truncated LmSAPΔAN1 led to up-regulation of GA biosynthetic genes and increased total gibberellins (GAs) content, corresponding with accelerated development in transgenic tobacco plants. Moreover, the dwarf phenotype of the transgenic lines that express LmSAPΔA20 and LmSAPΔA20-ΔAN1 under stress conditions was fully restored by the application of exogenous GA3. These findings improve our understanding of the role of LmSAP in regulating GA homeostasis, which is important for regulating plant development under abiotic stress conditions."

However, little is known about their effect on the structure and function of proteins. Previously, we reported that using the aroma form of TEMED (a diamine), representative of the ""smell of death"", could completely inhibit the fibril formation of HEWL, as an antibacterial enzyme, and a model protein for fibrillation studies. To take this further, in this study we investigated the kinetics of TEMED using a number of techniques and in particular X-ray crystallography to identify the binding site(s) of TEMED and search for hotspot(s) necessary to inhibit fibril formation of HEWL. Structural data, coupled with other experimental data reported in this study, revealed that TEMED completely inhibited fibril formation and stabilized the structure of HEWL through enhancement of the CH-Π interaction and binding to an inhibitor hotspot comprised of residues Lys33, Phe34, Glu35 and Asn37 of HEWL. Additionally, results from this study showed that the binding of TEMED increased the activity and thermal stability of HEWL, helping to improve the function of this antibacterial enzyme. In conclusion, the role of the ""smell of death”, as an important signal molecule affecting the activity and stability of HEWL was greatly highlighted, suggesting that aroma producing small molecules can be signals for structural and functional changes in proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3026459187,"Worldwide, nearly 3 million people die every year because of being overweight or obese. Although obesity is a metabolic disease, behavioral aspects are important in its etiology. Hunger changes the rewarding potential of food in normal-weight controls. In obesity, impairments related to reward processing are present, but it is not clear whether these are due to mental disorders more common among this population. Therefore, in this pilot study, we aimed at investigating whether fasting influence mood reactivity to reward in people with obesity. Women with obesity (n = 11, all mentally healthy) and normal weight controls (n = 17) were compared on a computerized monetary reward task (the wheel of fortune), using self-reports of mood and affect (e.g., PANAS and mood evaluation during the task) as dependent variables. This task was done in 2 satiety conditions, during fasting and after eating. Partially, in line with our expectation of a reduced affect and mood reactivity to monetary reward in participants with obesity accentuated by fasting, our results indicated a significant within-group difference across time (before and after the task), with monetary gains significantly improving positive affect in healthy controls (p>0.001), but not in individuals with obesity (p = 0.32). There were no significant between-group differences in positive affect before (p = 0.328) and after (p = 0.70) the task. In addition, women with obesity, compared to controls, reported more negative affect in general (p < 0.05) and less mood reactivity during the task in response to risky gains (p < 0.001) than healthy controls. The latter was independent of the level of satiety. These preliminary results suggest an impairment in mood reactivity to monetary reward in women with obesity which is not connected to the fasting state. Increasing the reinforcing potential of rewards other than food in obesity may be one target of intervention in order to verify if that could reduce overeating."
https://openalex.org/W3026559900,"Polyploidy has been an influential force in plant evolution, playing a crucial role in diversification. Differences in polyploid and diploid distributions have been long noted, with polyploid taxa especially abundant in harsh environments. These plants have higher photosynthetic rates and/or higher tolerance to water deficits. Moreover, there is data pointing to an increase in the rate of unreduced gamete formation by plants under conditions of stress. Accordingly, a higher frequency of polyploid individuals would be expected in populations living under extreme environments, a phenomenon that may be relevant when considering the origin of allopolyploid species. Hybridization between distinct autopolyploids is known to produce allopolyploids and hence, a high frequency of compatible autopolyploids in an area could enhance the formation of stable populations of the corresponding allopolyploid hybrid. Here we consider the allopolyploid species Gypsophila bermejoi G. López and its parental taxa G. struthium L. subsp. struthium and G. tomentosa L. We have used Species Distribution Models to locate areas with low bioclimatic suitability for both parental taxa during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), hypothesizing that the rate of tetraploid hybrid formation would be higher than expected where low suitability areas of both parental species overlap. We selected those areas taking into account the strict gypsophyllic nature of these taxa. There is data pointing to a post-glacial origin of the current G. bermejoi populations and according to our hypothesis, such locations could be centers for hybrid tetraploid formation or potential cradles of this species. Indeed, potential Mid-Holocene cradles were also identified in this manner. The evolution of bioclimatic suitability in both LGM and Mid-Holocene cradles was studied to assess the possible survival of the hybrids, and the current distribution of G. bermejoi proved to be consistent with our hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W3026574407,"Gaze-tracking techniques have advanced our understanding of visual attention and decision making during walking and athletic events, but little is known about how vision influences behavior during running over common, natural obstacles. This study tested hypotheses about whether runners regularly collect visual information and pre-plan obstacle clearance (feedforward control), make improvisational adjustments (online control), or some combination of both. In this study, the gaze profiles of 5 male and 5 female runners, fitted with a telemetric gaze-tracking device, were used to identify the frequency of fixations on an obstacle during a run. Overall, participants fixated on the obstacle 2.4 times during the run, with the last fixation occurring on average between 40% and 80% of the run, suggesting runners potentially shifted from a feedforward planning strategy to an online control strategy during the late portions of the running trial. A negative association was observed between runner velocity and average number of fixations. Consistent with previous studies on visual strategies used during walking, our results indicate that visual attentiveness is part of an important feedforward strategy for runners allowing them to safely approach an obstacle. Thus, visual obstacle attention is a key factor in the navigation of complex, natural landscapes while running."
https://openalex.org/W3027096385,"Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is essential for the accuracy of systems for automatic recognition of tree species for wood samples. In this study, a No-Reference IQA (NR-IQA), wood NR-IQA (WNR-IQA) metric was proposed to assess the quality of wood images. Support Vector Regression (SVR) was trained using Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) and Asymmetric Generalized Gaussian Distribution (AGGD) features, which were measured for wood images. Meanwhile, the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) was obtained from the subjective evaluation. This was followed by a comparison between the proposed IQA metric, WNR-IQA, and three established NR-IQA metrics, namely Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE), deepIQA, Deep Bilinear Convolutional Neural Networks (DB-CNN), and five Full Reference-IQA (FR-IQA) metrics known as MSSIM, SSIM, FSIM, IWSSIM, and GMSD. The proposed WNR-IQA metric, BRISQUE, deepIQA, DB-CNN, and FR-IQAs were then compared with MOS values to evaluate the performance of the automatic IQA metrics. As a result, the WNR-IQA metric exhibited a higher performance compared to BRISQUE, deepIQA, DB-CNN, and FR-IQA metrics. Highest quality images may not be routinely available due to logistic factors, such as dust, poor illumination, and hot environment present in the timber industry. Moreover, motion blur could occur due to the relative motion between the camera and the wood slice. Therefore, the advantage of WNR-IQA could be seen from its independency from a “perfect” reference image for the image quality evaluation."

The A family of polymerases includes T7 gp5, the eukaryotic mitochondrial polymerase γ, and Escherichia coli DNA Pol I. In E. coli Pol I, the carboxylates are present as aspartate 705 and aspartate 882. Mutation of either of these residues to alanine results in undetectable polymerase activity (7Polesky A.H.

Aspartate 882 functions in the finger-closing transition, whereas aspartate 705 functions to facilitate entry of a metal associated with the dNTP delivered into the active site. Although no similar mutants for gp5 have been identified, it seems likely that metal-coordinating aspartate residues in gp5 will play an analogous role as asp 705 and 882 in DNA Pol I because of the conservation of the nucleotidyl transfer step among all DNA polymerases (9Patel S.S.

Expression of this inactive polymerase (gp5-D475A/D654A) was deleterious to E. coli, as evidenced by a lack of growth of E. coli containing gene 5 expression plasmids. This toxic effect depended on the co-expression of thioredoxin by E. coli. In the present study we show that both in vivo and in vitro, the inactive T7 gp5 and thioredoxin form a complex that inhibits DNA synthesis mediated by the E. coli and T7 replisomes. The X-ray crystallographic structure of T7 DNA polymerase in complex with a primer/template shows that aspartate residues at position 475 and 654 in gp5 coordinate the two Mg2+ ions observable in the polymerase domain (Fig. 1) (12Doublié S.

We constructed gp5 variants with aspartate-to-alanine substitution at positions 475 and 654 and examined their ability to complement a T7 phage with a deletion in gene 5 (T7Δ5). None of the gp5 alleles we constructed containing alanine substitutions of the invariant Mg2+-binding active site aspartates were able to complement T7Δ5 (Table 1), suggesting that the mutations disrupted the enzymatic activity of gp5.Table 1Effect of T7 DNA polymerase (gp5) expression on E. coli and T7 growthView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)a T7 gene 5 coding both exonuclease and polymerase is located downstream of T7 promoter.b Efficiency of transformation.

Open table in a new tab a T7 gene 5 coding both exonuclease and polymerase is located downstream of T7 promoter. b Efficiency of transformation. All values are normalized against number of colonies obtained with WT gene 5 protein. To our surprise we were unable to transform the E. coli expression strain BL21 (DE3) with plasmids containing mutant gene 5 alleles under the control of the T7 promoter. Interestingly, transformation was successful with E. coli A307 (DE3) (data not shown), a protein overexpression strain that lacks the gene encoding thioredoxin (trxA), the processivity factor for T7 DNA polymerase, and that is routinely used in our laboratory to purify gp5 devoid of thioredoxin contamination. This result suggests that mutations in the polymerase active site of gp5 result in toxicity for E. coli growth, but this toxicity only occurs in the presence of thioredoxin. To examine the effect of thioredoxin on transformation efficiency in the same genetic background as E. coli BL21(DE3), we constructed an E. coli BL21(DE3) strain lacking gene trxA but that still retains the λDE3 lysogen designated E. coli BL21(DE3) ΔtrxA. The λDE3 lysogen integrated into this strain’s genome encodes T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the lactose-inducible lacUV5 promoter and is equally capable of expressing plasmid-encoded genes under the control of a T7 promoter as the parental BL21 (DE3) (data not shown). Plasmids harboring polymerase-inactive gp5 alleles can be transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) ΔtrxA as efficiently as the plasmid encoding WT gp5 (Table 1). This result confirms the necessity of thioredoxin in E. coli for inhibition of E. coli growth by expression of polymerase-inactive gp5 (gp5-D475A/D654A) (Table 1). Transformation efficiency in E. coli BL21, a strain that lacks the gene for T7 RNA polymerase in its chromosome, was also examined. This strain would be unable to express the plasmid-encoded gene 5, and comparison of transformation efficiency shows that the lack of expression of gp5-D475A/D654A or gp5-D475A does not produce a toxic effect, suggesting that the toxicity requires expression of mutant gp5. However, we observed a lower transformation efficiency of BL21 with a plasmid encoding the single gp5-D654A mutation (Table 1). The expression levels resulting from leaky basal expression of T7 RNA polymerase in (DE3) host cells are sufficient to drive the production of gp5-D475A/D654A to toxic levels, because isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was not present to induce high levels of expression. Toxicity is observed only when host cells containing both the trxA gene and a λDE3 lysogen are transformed with plasmids encoding gp5-D475A/D654A (Table 1). The genetic requirement for trxA for toxicity and the strong interaction between the two proteins (13Hamdan S.M. Marintcheva B. Cook T. Lee S.J. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. A unique loop in T7 DNA polymerase mediates the binding of helicase-primase, DNA binding protein, and processivity factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Additionally, a single substitution of alanine for aspartate at positions 475 or 654 in gp5 is sufficient for inhibition of E. coli growth (Table 1). The 3′–5′ exonuclease activity of gp5 is not required for the toxic effect, because gene 5 alleles expressing gp5 with or without exonuclease activity exhibit toxicity (data not shown). Further, no toxicity is observed in control experiments when E. coli is transformed by a polymerase-inactive version of E. coli Klenow fragment (KF-D705A/D882A-TBD) bearing an insertion of the gp5 thioredoxin-binding domain (TBD), which we previously showed confers increased processivity (Table 1) (14Bedford E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. The thioredoxin binding domain of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase confers processivity on Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94 (9012809): 479-48410.1073/pnas.94.2.479Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The observation that KF-D705A/D882A-TBD did not exhibit toxicity could be because although this chimeric protein has enhanced processivity in the presence of thioredoxin compared with WT Klenow fragment, it binds thioredoxin with a 10-fold lower affinity, its polymerase activity is only stimulated ∼8-fold by thioredoxin (compared with >2,500-fold for gp5), and it shows a 3-fold lower specific activity than gp5 in the presence of thioredoxin (14Bedford E. Tabor S. Richardson C.C. The thioredoxin binding domain of bacteriophage T7 DNA polymerase confers processivity on Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94 (9012809): 479-48410.1073/pnas.94.2.479Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition we found that gp5-D475A/D654A is similarly toxic for T7 phage growth. WT T7 phage is unable to grow in E. coli cells containing an expression plasmid bearing alleles encoding polymerase-inactive variants of gp5, whereas the presence of an expression plasmid with WT gp5 shows no inhibition of growth (Table 1). We expressed and purified gp5-D475A/D654A as well as an exonuclease-deficient variant (gp5-D5A/D65A/D475A/D654A) in E. coli A307 (DE3), an expression strain in which the endogenous trxA gene is deleted. Substitution of Asp475 and Asp654 to Ala selectively inactivated the polymerase activity of gp5. Both purified gp5-D475A/D654A versions have no detectable polymerase activity (<0.2%) as compared with WT T7 DNA polymerase using primed M13 (Fig. 2A). The selectivity of the mutations in targeting polymerase activity is underscored by the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity displayed by purified exonuclease-competent gp5-D473A/D654A (Fig. 2B). A plausible explanation for the inhibition of E. coli growth by the presence of an inactive T7 DNA polymerase is that the inhibition results from an interference of the E. coli replisome by the inactive polymerase. To determine whether this is the case, the effect of T7 gp5-D475A/D654A on an in vitro E. coli replication system was examined. This reconstituted system results in coordinated synthesis of leading and lagging strands, with rates comparable with those determined for E. coli DNA replication in vivo (15Wu C.A. Zechner E.L.

The addition of a complex of gp5-D475A/D654A and Trx into DNA replication reactions catalyzed by the E. coli replisome led to a greater than 95% reduction in DNA synthesis (Fig. 3A). We conclude that gp5-D475A/D654A inhibits E. coli growth by interfering directly with DNA synthesis mediated by the bacterial replisome. The inhibition of DNA synthesis by gp5-D475A/D654A depends on the presence of thioredoxin. The addition of gp5-D475A/D654A in the absence of thioredoxin to DNA synthesis reactions mediated by the E. coli replisome, up to a concentration of 320 nm, does not result in any significant decrease in DNA synthesis (Fig. 3). Likewise, the presence of thioredoxin alone fails to inhibit E. coli Pol III–dependent DNA synthesis (Fig. 3B). Although WT gp5/Trx was able to attenuate E. coli replication at high concentrations, it did so with markedly lower potency than gp5-D75A/D654A/Trx. At concentrations greater than 80 nm, gp5-D475A/D654A/Trx essentially eliminated DNA synthesis by E. coli Pol III, whereas significant levels of DNA synthesis by Pol III persisted even at the highest concentration of WT gp5/Trx tested (Fig. 3A). The decrease in DNA synthesis by WT gp5/Trx may arise from an indirect effect on DNA synthesis (see “Discussion”). Given that polymerase-inactive gp5 alleles are also toxic for T7 phage growth (Table 1), we examined the effect of gp5-D475A/D654A on the T7 DNA replication system. The presence of gp5-D475A/D654A partially inhibits the activity of WT T7 DNA polymerase and the T7 replisome. We first tested the effect of gp5-D475A/D654A on primer extension by T7 DNA polymerase. There is significant inhibition of the extension of a primer annealed to M13 ssDNA by WT T7 DNA polymerase only at gp-5D475A/D654A concentrations equivalent or higher than the concentration of WT polymerase present in the reaction (Fig. 4A). In the absence of gp5-D475A/D654A, partially extended intermediates that arise from polymerase pausing at regions of secondary structure accumulate at earlier time points but diminish as synthesis progresses through the structured region (Fig. 4A, second and fourth lanes, black arrow) At concentrations of gp5-D475A/D654A approximately equimolar or in excess to WT gp5, these intermediates persist even at the longest time points, with a concomitant decrease in fully extended products (Fig. 4A, eighth through sixteenth lanes, white arrow). gp5-D475A/D654A inhibits leading strand DNA synthesis, catalyzed by T7 DNA polymerase and the T7 helicase gp4 (Fig. 4B). During leading strand DNA synthesis, gp4 unwinds upstream dsDNA, generating the single-stranded template for nucleotide polymerization by T7 DNA polymerase. Together, gp4 and T7 DNA polymerase display a processivity of >17 kb (3Kulczyk A.W. Richardson C.C.

The presence of gp5-D475A/D654A leads to a dose-dependent decrease in deoxyribonucleotide incorporation. At a concentration of 30 nm, gp5-D475A/D654A inhibits DNA synthesis by ∼50%. However, at the highest concentration of gp5-D475A/D654A tested (320 nm), synthesis of the leading strand still occurs at a value of ∼20% of control reactions (Fig. 4C). The effect of gp5-D475A/D654A was also examined under conditions where leading and lagging strands are synthesized in a coordinated manner (Fig. 4C). The presence of gp5-D475A/D654A leads to a similar degree of inhibition of DNA synthesis of leading and lagging strands (Fig. 4C). Similar to the results observed for leading strand synthesis, significant DNA synthesis persists even at high concentrations of gp5-D475A/D654A. In conclusion, gp5-D475A/D654A also inhibits T7 DNA replication in vitro, but to a lesser extent than the inhibition observed for the E. coli replisome in vitro. T7 DNA polymerase has a high affinity for a primer template, with a Kd of 20 nm (9Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A.

One possibility for the inhibitory effect of gp5-D475A/D654A/Trx is that it retains its ability to bind to a primer template but is locked in position, because it is unable to covalently link the incoming nucleotide to the primer. We compared the ability of WT gp5 and gp5-D475A/D654A to bind to a primer template and to ssDNA using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), in both the presence and the absence of Trx (Fig. 5A). gp5-D475A/D654A exhibits the same binding characteristics as WT gp5. In the case of both gp5 variants, no significant binding is observed to either ssDNA or primer/template in the absence of Trx (Fig. 5A, lanes 2–5 and 15–18). Like WT gp5, gp5-D4754A/D654A binds the primer/template stably only in the presence of thioredoxin (Fig. 5A, lanes 19–26). This strong binding is specific for a primer/template configuration because only weak binding to ssDNA is observed (Fig. 5A, lanes 2–5 and 15–18). The presence of thioredoxin slightly increases the affinity of gp5-D475A/D654A for ssDNA (Fig. 5A, lanes 4, 5, and 10–13). However, the polymerase–DNA complex formed is unstable under these electrophoretic conditions. Nevertheless, a decrease in the signal for free, labeled ssDNA and a smear representing labile protein–DNA complexes during electrophoresis is observed (Fig. 5A, lanes 2–13). We used surface plasmon resonance to obtain a more quantitative description of the DNA-binding characteristics of gp5-D475A/D654. We used a series of binding experiments in which a concentration series of either WT gp5/Trx or gp5-475A/D654A/Trx was flowed over a immobilized primer template in the absence of deoxyribonucleotides and determined the kinetic parameters for their interaction (Fig. 5B and C). The results show that gp5-D475A/D654A/Trx binds a primer/template DNA with a 4-fold greater affinity than WT gp5/Trx. The increased affinity of gp5-D475A/D654A/Trx for primer/template DNA is solely due to enhanced association kinetics. As suggested in the experiment presented in Fig. 5B, the dissociation rate constant (koff) is identical between both gp5 variants. However, the association rate constant (kon) of gp5-D475A/D654A/Trx for primer/template DNA is roughly four times greater than for WT gp5/Trx. These results suggest that although the active site in gp5-D475/D654A/Trx cannot incorporate a nucleotide because it lacks the catalytic aspartates for polymerization, it associates with primer/template DNA faster, resulting in a higher affinity compared with WT gp5/Trx (17Florián J.

We targeted these postulated catalytic residues by replacing each or both aspartates with alanine. We were surprised when we were unable to obtain transformants of singly or doubly substituted aspartate-to-alanine gene 5 alleles using common E. coli expression strains. We find that expression of polymerase-inactive gp5 is toxic if the host cells contain a functional allele for thioredoxin; no toxicity is observed in cells lacking thioredoxin. In addition, we find that the toxic effect is not observed in E. coli strains lacking the (DE3) lysogen, which encodes T7 RNA polymerase. This finding suggests that the levels of gp5-D475A/D654A protein that accumulate as a result of “leaky expression” of T7 RNA polymerase from the lacUV5 promoter in the (DE3) lysogen are sufficient to inhibit E. coli growth. In other words, our genetic analysis indicates that the toxic effect is manifest with very low expression of the altered polymerase. Combined, these results show that a complex of polymerase-inactive gene 5 DNA polymerase with thioredoxin is toxic for E. coli growth. We do not observe a toxic effect with WT gp5 or other polymerase active site gp5 variants. Toxicity depends on the presence of thioredoxin and is specific for gp5; no toxicity is observed in trxA− strains. Furthermore, a pol− Klenow fragment bearing homologous mutations corresponding to the magnesium-coordinating residues in the polymerase active site of gp5 and containing the TBD of gp5 did not exhibit toxicity. This latter result is not too surprising, considering that the chimeric protein shows a marginal level of stimulation in the presence of thioredoxin compared with gp5, has a 10-fold lower affinity for Trx than does T7 gp5, and is 3-fold less active than gp5/Trx, and its complex with Trx has a lower processivity compared with gp5/Trx (14Bedford E.

https://openalex.org/W3026145707,"Digital natives developed in an electronic dual tasking world. This paper addresses two questions. Do digital natives respond differently under a cognitive load realized during a locomotor task in a dual-tasking paradigm and how does this address the concept of safety? We investigate the interplay between cognitive (talking and solving Raven's matrices) and locomotor (walking on a treadmill) tasks in a sample of 17 graduate level participants. The costs of dual-tasking on gait were assessed by studying changes in stride interval time and its variability at long-range. A safety index was designed and computed from total relative change between the variability indices in the single walking and dual-task conditions. As expected, results indicate high Raven's scores with gait changes found between the dual task conditions compared to the single walking task. Greater changes are observed in the talking condition compared to solving Raven's matrices, resulting in high safety index values observed in 5 participants. We conclude that, although digital natives are efficient in performing the dual tasks when they are not emotional-based, modification of gait are observable. Due to the variation within participants and the observation of high safety index values in several of them, individuals that responded poorly to low cognitive loads should be encouraged to not perform dual task when executing a primate task of safety to themselves or others."
https://openalex.org/W3027817010,"Chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection and liver fibrosis have been a major health problem worldwide. However, less research has been conducted owing to the lack of animal models. The key purpose of this study was to determine the effects of different hepatotoxins in HBV-affected liver. In this study, we successfully generated a combined liver fibrosis model by administering HBV 1.2 plasmid and thioacetamide/ethanol (TAA/EtOH). To our knowledge, this is the first study in which an increase in the liver fibrosis level is observed by the intraperitoneal administration of TAA and EtOH in drinking water after the hydrodynamic transfection of the HBV 1.2 plasmid in C3H/HeN mice. The HBV+TAA/EtOH group exhibited higher level of hepatic fibrosis than that of the control groups. The hepatic stellate cell activation in the TAA- and EtOH-administered groups was demonstrated by the elevation in the level of fibrotic markers. In addition, high levels of collagen content and histopathological results were also used to confirm the prominent fibrotic levels. We established a novel HBV mice model by hydrodynamic injection-based HBV transfection in C3H/HeN mice. C3H/HeN mice were reported to have a higher HBV persistence level than that of the C57BL/6 mouse model. All the results showed an increased fibrosis level in the HBV mice treated with TAA and EtOH; hence, this model would be useful to understand the effect of hepatotoxins on the high risk of fibrosis after HBV infection. The acceleration of liver fibrosis can occur with prolonged administration as well as the high dosage of hepatotoxins in mice."
