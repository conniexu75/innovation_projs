https://openalex.org/W2091375917,An experiment in which 150 proposals submitted to the National Science Foundation were evaluated independently by a new set of reviewers indicates that getting a research grant depends to a significant extent on chance. The degree of disagreement within the population of eligible reviewers is such that whether or not a proposal is funded depends in a large proportion of cases upon which reviewers happen to be selected for it. No evidence of systematic bias in the selection of NSF reviewers was found.

Most are treated as if they pose equal potential risk to humans, and this is not consistent with the available data. Without knowledge of carcinogenic mechanisms, the evaluation of responses in intact mammalian surrogates best reflects the potential levels of human risk. An example of a scoring system is proposed by which animal carcinogens are ranked according to the most relevant toxicological evidence derived from animal and genotoxicity studies. Different classes of animal carcinogens could thus be recognized and would permit several regulatory options and provide a means to establish priorities for public and scientific concerns."

When the same muscle acts as a synergist as opposed to a prime mover, about 8 percent of the unit pairs consistently reversed their recruitment order. Motor commands appear to be patterned in terms of movements rather than muscles and to involve different connectivities to the motoneuron pool of a muscle executing movements in different directions."
https://openalex.org/W2002351343,"Leucine catabolism is regulated by either of the first two degradative steps: (reversible) transamination to the keto acid or subsequent decarboxylation. A method is described to measure rates of leucine transamination, reamination, and keto acid oxidation. The method is applied directly to humans by infusing the nonradioactive tracer, L-[15N,1-13C]leucine. Leucine transamination was found to be operating several times faster than the keto acid decarboxylation and to be of equal magnitude in adult human males under two different dietary conditions, postabsorptive and fed. These results indicate that decarboxylation, not transamination, is the rate-limiting step in normal human leucine metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1533674371,"The sudden addition of Na+ to mouse neuroblastoma cells suspended in Na+-free medium causes a rapid but transient increase in the rate of H+ release from the cells. Li+ can substitute for Na+, but addition of choline, K+, or Ca2+ has no effect. This process has the following properties: it is distinct from metabolic acid production, it does not require ATP, and it saturates at about 40 mM external Na+; it is independent of membrane potential and can be mimicked by addition of the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin to cells in Na+-containing media. In contrast, a net uptake of protons is observed when Na+-loaded cells are suddenly exposed to Na+-free medium. Na+-induced H+ extrusion is accompanied by a rise in intracellular pH, as inferred from an enhanced net uptake of weak acids and from direct pH measurements on lysed cells. Conversely, Na+ uptake by the cells is stimulated upon lowering the intracellular pH with externally applied acetate. Na+-dependent proton transport, intracellular alkalinization, and acetate-stimulated Na+ uptake are completely inhibited by the diuretic amiloride (0.2 mM) and do not occur in digitonin-permeabilized cells. It is concluded that the plasma membrane of neuroblastoma cells contains an electroneutral Na+/H+ exchange system which is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH."

https://openalex.org/W1507242932,"Equilibrium-binding data of highly purified avian lipoprotein lipase to cultured bovine endothelial cells demonstrate the presence of a class of high affinity sites. Analysis of the binding function by weighted least squares technique yielded an association constant of K = 0.7 X 10(7) M-1 and a maximum binding capacity of 1.6 micrograms/1.9 X 10(6) cells. Lipoprotein lipase was monitored both by its catalytic activity and a sensitive radioimmunoassay which permitted the accurate measurement of nanogram quantities of enzyme protein. Specific activity of the bound enzyme was similar to that of the initial purified enzyme. Lipoprotein lipase binding to endothelial cells was inhibited 80% by preincubating cells in 0.1% trypsin for 3 min at 37 degrees C, 92% by 0.01% pronase, and 91% by 0.008% proteinase K. Heparin was most efficient in releasing lipoprotein lipase from endothelial cells. Fifty per cent of the enzyme appeared in the medium at a concentration of 3 micrograms/ml of heparin. At the same concentration of heparan sulfate, 20% of the enzyme was released. Hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate were not effective in stimulating enzyme release. Preincubating endothelial cells with purified human platelet endoglucuronidase for 1 h at 37 degrees C led to a 90% reduction in lipoprotein lipase binding. Endoglucuronidase was purified 20,000-fold as compared to the initial platelet lysate by a 5-step purification method. The extent of inhibition of binding was shown to be dependent on concentration of endoglucuronidase in the preincubation medium. The specificity of platelet endoglucuronidase and the demonstration that the preparation utilized contained no detectable protease activity is further evidence that lipoprotein lipase is bound to endothelial cell heparan sulfate or heparan sulfate-like molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1980012082,"The persistence of synthetic herbicides such as 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T) and its release in massive amounts as a herbicide (Agent Orange) have created toxicological problems in many countries. In nature, 2,4,5-T is slowly degraded by cooxidation and is not utilized as a sole source of carbon and energy. The technique of plasmid-assisted molecular breeding has led to the development of bacterial strains capable of totally degrading 2,4,5-T by using it as their sole source of carbon at high concentrations (greater than 1 mg/ml). Spectrophotometry and gas chromatography reveal various intermediates during growth of the culture with 2,4,5-T."
https://openalex.org/W1983994437,"In vitamin D-deficient rats intestinal calcium transport increased significantly 4 hours after an injection of prolactin, reached a maximum after 8 hours, and declined to preinjection levels after 24 hours. Similarly, in vitamin D-deficient rats fed a diet low in calcium or phosphorus prolactin stimulated an increase in serum calcium in both groups and an increase in serum phosphorus in the rats fed the diet low in phosphorus. Thus it appears that prolactin affects organs involved in calcium regulation in a manner that is independent of the vitamin D endocrine system."
https://openalex.org/W1989230773,When pregnant rats were fed a 50 percent galactose diet there was a striking reduction in oocyte number in the offspring. The most prominent effects were noted after exposure to galactose during the premeiotic stages of oogenesis. Prenatal exposure to galactose or its metabolites may contribute to the premature ovarian failure characteristic of human galactosemia.
https://openalex.org/W2077773437,The dimensions of the small intestinal diffusion barrier interposed between luminal nutrients and their membrane receptors were determined from kinetic analysis of substrate hydrolysis by integral surface membrane enzymes. The calculated equivalent thickness of the unstirred water layer was too large to be compatible with the known dimensions of rat intestine. The discrepancy could be reconciled by consideration of the mucous coat overlying the intestinal surface membrane. Integral surface membrane proteins could not be labeled by an iodine-125 probe unless the surface coat was first removed. The mucoprotein surface coat appears to constitute an important diffusion barrier for nutrients seeking their digestive and transport sites on the outer intestinal membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2089384209,"Clear delineation of breast architecture was achieved with compound pulse echo ultrasound imaging in which the images were acquired in the coronal planes used for quantitative transmission ultrasonic computed tomography. Since most connective tissue planes in the breast radiate toward the nipple, compound scans from the sides of the breast record normal interfaces more consistently and reveal greater symmetries in normal portions of relatively full breasts than do conventional scans in sagittal or transverse planes. Simultaneous acquisition of the pulse echo images and images representing the local ultrasound attenuation coefficient and speed of ultrasound suggested complementary role for reflection and through-transmission images in breast cancer detection. The high quality of pulse echo images in coronal planes provides the potential for more complete pulse echo diagnosis and the basis for spatial correlation of lesions viewed in pulse echo and ultrasonic computed tomograms. These observations may permit routine ultrasonic computed tomography of the breast in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W1503766585,"Two different calcium-binding proteins, S-100 and calmodulin, have been isolated from bovine brain by calcium-dependent affinity chromatography on calmodulin antagonist coupled to Sepharose. Calmodulin antagonist N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-l-napthdenesulfonamide (W-7) has been coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B or cyanogen bromide-acitivated Sepharose 4B. S-100-like protein bound to W-7 coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B in the presence of Ca2+ was eluted with the buffer containing 4 m~ ethylene glycol bis(j3-aminoethyl ether)-N,NJ?’,iV-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) instead of Ca2+. This protein did not stimulate cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and was identified as S-100 by demonstrating its cross-reaction with rabbit antisera to bovine 5-100. Amino acid composition together with electrophoretic evidence shows that S-100-like protein is a mixture of S-100a and S100b. Calmodulin-like protein bound to W-7 coupled to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B in the presence of Ca2+ was eluted with buffer containing 4 m~ EGTA. This protein could stimulate cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and had an amino acid compostion and electrophoretic mobility very similar to those of calmodulin, indicating that this protein is calmodulin. When N-6-aminohexyl)-l-naphthalene sulfonamide (W5), a chloro-deficient analogue which has lower affinity for calmodulin than W-7, was coupled to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B, calmodulin instead of S-100 did bind to this Sepharose in the presence of Ca2+ and was eluted with the buffer containing 4 mM EGTA. These results indicate that different immobilized naphthalenesulfonamide derivatives interact differently with S100 and calmodulin in a calcium-dependent manner and provide a rapid purification procedure for S-100 and calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1541059747,"Ferrochelatase from rat liver mitochondria was purified 628-fold with a 25% yield to apparent homogeneity. The purification procedure involved solubilization of the enzyme with sodium cholate, followed by ammonium sulfate fractionation and blue Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 42,000 by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Sepharose 6B gel filtration gave a molecular weight of 240,000. The purified enzyme was analyzed for amino acid composition and shown to have abundant amounts of lysine (11%) and hydrophobic amino acid residues (48%). The enzyme was quite stable in a buffer containing 20% glycerol and 1 mM dithiothreitol. When the enzyme was assayed in the presence of palmitic acid, the specific activity for mesoheme synthesis was approximately 12,000 nmol formed/30 min/mg of protein at 37 degrees C; for protoheme synthesis, a value of 3,500 nmol formed/30 min/mg of protein was obtained. The optimum pH for the reaction was 7.8, and the Km values for the substrates were as follows: protoporphyrin IX, 28.5 microM; mesoporphyrin IX, 26.7 microM; iron with protoporphyrin IX, 33.1 microM; and iron with mesoporphyrin IX, 37.4 microM. Enzyme activity was inhibited by metals such as Co, Zn, Pb, Cu, or Mn and was highly sensitive to sulfhydryl inhibitors. The purified enzyme contained fatty acids, and its activity was markedly stimulated by their addition. Phospholipids slightly stimulated enzyme activity. Short chain carbonic acids and neutral lipids produced no effects."
https://openalex.org/W2008019000,"An in vitro preparation of the dorsal epithelium of the dog tongue actively transports ions, producing a transepithelial potential difference characteristic of the ions and their concentration. Hypertonic sodium chloride solutions generally cause increased potentials and short-circuit currents and reduced resistances when placed on the mucosal surface. This hypertonic flux is eliminated by ouabain and is not found in ventral lingual epithelia. When either sodium acetate or tetramethylammonium chloride is substituted for sodium chloride in the mucosal medium, the currents are diminished but their sum at a given concentration approximates that for sodium chloride at the same concentration. This result suggests a current composed of inward sodium ion movement and outward chloride ion movement. Actively regulated potentials and currents, whether generated in the taste buds or in supporting cells, may be important in both normal chemotransduction and in taste responses evoked by currents passing through the tongue."
https://openalex.org/W2037829918,Global food insecuity is growing as the worldwide attempt to expand food production loses momentum. The grain surpluses that accumulated in the food exporting countries during the decades of the 1950s and the 1960s have disappeared. World food supplies are tightening and the slim excess of growth in food production over population is narrowing. Throughout the world pressures on the cropland are intensifying. Focus in this discussion of world population growth is on the loss of momentum the return of famine the North American breadbasket declining food security the conversion of cropland to nonfarm use thinning topsoil land productivity trends and the loss of irrigated land. As the decade of 1980 begins the growth in world food production is losing momentum and its excess over population growth is narrowing. In Africa if soils continue to deteriorate the 10 year decline in food output per person there could become chronic. If soil erosion and the other forces that have slowed food production in the world as a whole continue to intensify and the projected population increases occur then growth in food production could drop below that of population for the world as a whole. Responding effectively to the cropland threats associated with mounting food demands creates a dilemma for both farmers and governmental planners. Economic forces and political instincts encourage short-term measures yet pressures to wring too much from the land in the short run could destroy it over the long run. Wider public understanding of the longterm effect of cropland conversion and topsoil loss on food prices is the key to an effective worldwide response. The US Soil Conservation Service has outlined a national plan that would bring the annual loss of topsoil down to a tolerable level. Along with maintaining the conservation systems now in place some 158 million acres of the 413 million acre cropland base need additional attention. Of this total 17 million acres of cropland are eroding so rapidly that the Soil Conservation Service recommends that it be shifted from continuous row cropping and converted to either woodland grassland or longterm rotation. The remaining 141 million acres of cropland that are presently losing over 5 tons of soil per year are in need of the adoption of some form of conservation tillage. Officials in India are struggling with the same issues as officials and soil scientists in the US. Governments everywhere must consider the realignment of priorities that will allow soils to be stabilized.

Total values ranged from 9.2 to 25.6 micrograms/100 ml of which 31-35% was free sterol.

https://openalex.org/W1561135914,"Three separate techniques have been employed to estimate the critical micelle concentration: spin labeling using 6-doxylstearoyl-CoA, gel permeation chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation. The first method is a labeling technique. The latter two methods utilize no potentially interfering probe and provide a value for the aggregation number for palmitoyl-CoA. All three methods provide a critical micelle concentration for palmitoyl-CoA no lower than 30 to 60 microM. The latter methods provide an aggregation number near 40 and certainly no larger than 200. These values are inconsistent with the values suggested earlier (Zahler, W. L., Barden, R. E., and Cleland, W. W. (1968) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 164, 1-11). The spin-labeled analogues, 6- and 16-doxylstearoyl-CoA, were shown not to micellize, yet these analogues were good inhibitors for citrate synthase. These observations will require the re-examination of a large body of literature in which inhibition of enzymes by fatty acyl-CoA at concentrations below 30 microM was simply ascribed to the formation of micelles."
https://openalex.org/W1601698275,"The membrane receptor of epithelial cells which binds polymeric immunoglobulins and mediates their transepithelial translocation is antigenically related to secretory component (SC), a glycoprotein produced by the epithelial cells. In rabbit milk, secreted SC is found either bound to polymeric immunoglobulin A (IgA) or in a free form. It is comprised of a heterogeneous population of molecules with apparent Mr = 83,000 and 80,000 (upper doublet) and 58,000 and 55,000 (lower doublet). Membrane SC was isolated by immunoadsorption from deoxycholate-solubilized plasma membranes of rabbit liver and mammary gland. The purified proteins, heterogenous in size with apparent Mr = 120,000 and 116,000 (upper doublet) and 95,000 and 91,000 (lower doublet), were amphiphilic. One-dimensional peptide maps revealed extensive structural homology between both the upper doublets of the membrane and secreted SC, as well as between the lower doublets. This indicates that the high Mr membrane SC of hepatocytes and mammary cells are precursors of the lower Mr secreted SC found in bile and milk. All four membrane SC, purified in high yield from rabbit liver by immunoadsorption and preparative electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, bound IgA dimer specifically. The affinity (Kd approximately equal to 10 nM) was similar to the one observed in free SC-IgA dimer interaction. Only the membrane proteins recognized by the anti-SC antibodies were able to bind polymeric IgA. In liver membrane preparations, the receptor was localized at the surface of smooth vesicles, using IgA dimer-biotin and avidin-gold. Our results indicate that the high Mr membrane SC is the plasma membrane receptor for polymeric immunoglobulin."

These nerves can regenerate readily in the adult, however, and such regenerating nerves do not respect domain borders; moreover, they functionally displace endings of intact nerves that earlier had sprouted into denervated skin."

Mucus is obtained in nonhydrated form by electrically stimulating the anesthetized hagfish and the secretions are stirred into ammonium sulfate. Centrifugation and filtration are than used to isolate the two major secretory products, mucous vesicles and threads.

https://openalex.org/W1541946496,"The reactions of protocatechuate dioxygenase (protocatechuate:oxygen 3,4-oxidoreductase, EC 1.13.11.3) with substrates and oxygen have been studied at 4 degrees C using rapid kinetic techniques. In this study, two oxygenated intermediates were kinetically and spectrally characterized. The rate of oxygen addition to the enzyme-substrate complex was determined to be 5 X 10(5) M-1 s-1. This oxygenated complex rapidly converts (450 s-1) to another spectrally identifiable compound which then breaks down into free enzyme and the product, beta-carboxy-cis,cis-muconic acid. To carry out these experiments properly, it was necessary to use hyperbaric oxygen, thus obtaining approximately 6 mM final concentration of oxygen. The procedure is described in this work. It was also shown that the normally slow substrate, dihydroxyphenyl propionate, when reacted with the enzyme and oxygen, rapidly forms two sequential intermediates. However, the second intermediate was not spectrally the same as that observed with protocatechuate, but was more like that of enzyme-product complexes. Similar, although less extensive, studies using the protocatechuate dioxygenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed that very analogous behavior occurred with both substrates as did with the Pseudomonas putida enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2152976766,"The basic realities of the distribution of the world's population, wealth, and agricultural production base are not conducive to an automatic stabilizing process for the world's hungry. Increasing volatility in the world grain production in the 1980's could create a problem of major proportions. By 1990, the developed world will account for 24 percent of the world's population, 85 percent of the world's economic activity, and around 50 percent of the world's grain production and consumption. On a per capita basis, the developed world will consume nearly three times as much grain as the developing countries which account for three-fourths of the world's population. Increased food aid, which is essential, is not the solution to the basic problem. The low-income countries need a massive infusion of capital investment, research support, and education if they are to build infrastructures that have the capacity to produce, distribute, and market food supplies. Other options serve only to prolong and aggravate the current disparities."

The enzyme was completely separated from mannosyltransferases that synthesize alpha-1,2-mannosyl-mannose linkages, but the purified preparation still contained some activity which synthesized alpha-1,6-mannosyl linkages. The enzyme has a requirement for divalent cations and a pH optimum between 6.8 and 7.3, and the purified enzyme was very sensitive to detergent concentration with optimal activity at 0.0225% Nonidet P-40. The extent of purification of the enzyme and its resistance to inhibition by amphomycin strongly suggest that the enzyme catalyzes direct transfer from nucleotide-sugar to the oligosaccharide-lipid acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1559580242,"The relationship of the phosphate potential (delta GP) to the free energy released by the oxidation of NADH (redox potential or delta GR) was studied in suspensions of inverted inner membrane vesicles prepared from rat liver mitochondria. At delta GR values less negative than -52.2 kcal/mol, delta GP was a linear function of delta GR during oxidative phosphorylation at static head. At more negative delta GR, delta GP no longer increased but remained, more or less, at a constant value. At all values of delta GR, delta GP increased as Pi decreased. At high Pi, ATP/ADP was relatively independent of Pi, but at low Pi there was a strong interdependence of ATP/ADP and Pi. The experimental data were analyzed in terms of the theory of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The degree of coupling, q, averaged 0.8 as estimated from the dependence of respiratory rate on delta GP. From measurements of -delta GR/delta GP at static head and from the estimates of q, an average value of four was calculated for Z, the phenomenological stoichiometry. The results support a 4-proton model of chemiosmotic coupling in which proton stoichiometries are 4H+/site, 3H+/ATPase, and 1H+/translocation of ATP for ADP and Pi. The results further indicate that the site by site reactions of oxidative phosphorylation operate close to thermodynamic equilibrium. This implies that ATP/site ratios are proportional to the redox potentials across each site at static head. Based on the oxidation-reduction potentials of NADH, ubiquinone, and cytochrome c, it follows that the ideal ATP/site ratios of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are 1, 1/2, and 1 1/2, respectively, for sites 1, 2, and 3."
https://openalex.org/W1586090088,"The monomeric unit of the acetylcholine receptor of electric tissue of Torpedo californica has previously been shown to have a subunit composition of alpha 2 beta gamma delta. Receptor in membrane isolated from Torpedo electric tissue occurs as both monomer and dimer. In the dimer which is the predominant form, the monomeric units are cross-linked via a disulfide bond between delta chains. The addition of diamide to receptor-rich membrane causes the formation of trimer and higher oligomers in which the monomeric units are linked by disulfide bonds alternately between pairs of delta chains and between pairs of beta chains. We have isolated receptor trimer and determined the relative locations of the monomeric units by scanning transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained preparations. In face view, the trimer appears as three approximately 90 A disks, each with a central, densely staining pit. From the angles of the triangle formed by the lines connecting the centers of the monomers in the trimer, we infer that the beta-beta disulfide bond is separated from the delta-delta disulfide bond by an angle in the range of 50-80 degrees."

https://openalex.org/W1643900776,"A simple, efficient method to couple covalently DNA to cellulose is described. It utilizes the bifunctional oxirane 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether to activate cellulose and subsequently to link DNA to the cellulose. The optimal conditions for the latter reaction included use of a dehydration technique whereby DNA and activated cellulose were allowed to react on a glass slide in 0.1 N NaOH. Initial volume of the reaction was important; less than or equal to 250 microliters/50 mg cellulose was necessary for maximum efficiency. At DNA concentrations of less than or equal to 4 micrograms/mg cellulose, efficiency of binding was 90%. Binding studies using nucleotide homopolymers indicated that the order of the relative efficiencies of binding was poly(dT) greater than poly(dC) = poly(dA) greater than poly(dG). DNAs subjected to the binding conditions had an average of 0-1 breaks/molecule (for a 915-base DNA). A cloned double-stranded cDNA was coupled to cellulose by this technique. The cDNA was coupled to cellulose by this technique. The DNA-cellulose matrix was successfully used to purify the complementary mRNA from total poly(A)-enriched RNA by affinity chromatography. This method is very simple and highly efficient and can be conveniently adapted for the covalent coupling of various DNA species to cellulose for affinity chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W2081895280,"When the image of a stationary, sinusoidal luminance grating is stabilized on the retina of a human subject, he becomes unable to detect this stimulus at contrasts that are readily visible in normal, unstabilized vision. At much higher contrasts, such stabilized gratings can still be seen over most of the normal range of spatial frequencies, although the threshold contrast may be increased by as much as 20 or 30 times. When the analogous experiment is performed with an isoluminance chromatic grating, however, there is no contrast that can restore the visibility of the stabilized grating; the threshold elevations for stabilized chromatic gratings are too great to measure. Saturated red/green gratings fade out and disappear at 100 percent contrast (even where this is 45 times the unstabilized threshold), and they do not reappear as long as stabilization is maintained. Without some kind of temporal variation of the proximal stimulus, the opponent-color pathways apparently do not respond to spatial patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1521982069,"Synthesis of acetylcholine receptor of muscle cells in culture is regulated by the activity of the muscle fibers. We have investigated the effect of ryanodine on acetylcholine receptor metabolism. Ryanodine is a plant alkaloid which at micromolar concentrations causes contraction of skeletal muscle due to depletion of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, while at higher concentrations it stimulates efflux of calcium from the muscle cell. We found that, after a 48-h exposure of chick myofiber cultures, micromolar concentrations of ryanodine decreased receptor levels to approximately 60% of control, while millimolar concentrations increased receptor levels to over 200% of control. This appears to be a specific effect on the synthesis of the receptor since appearance rates but not degradation rates are altered by the drug. Intracellular transport is not affected as both surface and total receptor content are changed in parallel. The differences in receptor levels probably do not reflect a general alteration of"
https://openalex.org/W1594855139,"The reactions of human hemoglobin and sperm whale myoglobin with ethyl nitrite under aerobic conditions have been examined in kinetic detail. Ethyl nitrite converts two equivalents of oxyhemoglobin or oxymyoglobin to their oxidized counterparts with concurrent production of one equivalent each of molecular oxygen, nitrate ion, and ethyl alcohol. Inverse first order kinetic dependence on the concentration of molecular oxygen has been observed and is interpreted by a mechanism in which oxygen dissociation from the oxyhemoprotein occurs prior to rate-limiting oxidation by ethyl nitrite. The rate constant for ethyl nitrite oxidation of hemoglobin from which the fourth oxygen has dissociated is calculated to be 45 times greater than the corresponding rate constant for oxidation of deoxyhemoglobin. This rate enhancement is proposed to be a reflection of the oxidative susceptibility of the R and T conformational states of hemoglobin. Results obtained for the oxidation of myoglobin confirm this interpretation as do kinetic data for hemoglobin and myoglobin oxidations by iron(III) and copper(II) complexes. The effects of organic phosphates on rates for hemoglobin oxidations are interpreted in terms of oxidation inhibition by molecular oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1532365081,"The adenosine analog xylosyladenine is a potent inducer of hemoglobin synthesis in Friend virus-infected murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. In cultures treated with 0.1 microM xylosyladenine and an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, 80% of the cells accumulated hemoglobin. Under these conditions, cell growth was inhibited by 50%. No effect was observed in the absence of adenosine deaminase inhibition. An adenosine kinase-deficient MEL subline was isolated and was found to be resistant to induction by xylosyladenine. Treated cells accumulated substantial amounts of the xylofuranosyl analogs of ATP, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine, indicating that metabolites of xylosyladenine participate in S-adenosylmethionine-mediated transmethylation reactions. Measurements of in vivo nucleic acid methylation showed that xylosyladenine causes a marked inhibition of 2'-O-methyluridine, 2'-O-methylcytidine, 5-methyluridine, and 5-methylcytidine formation in the RNA of treated cells. DNA methylation was not inhibited. These data suggest that the xylofuranosyl analogs of S-adenosylmethionine and/or S-adenosylhomocysteine can inhibit intracellular RNA methylation in MEL cells while having little or no such effect on DNA methylation."
https://openalex.org/W2139624634,"Abstract In an attempt to gain an understanding of the mechanism by which toxins enter cells, we have analyzed the intoxication of diphtheria toxin in the toxin-resistant L cell and compared these results with those previously reported for toxin-sensitive HeLa and KB cells (Uchida, T., Pappenheimer, A. M., Jr., and Harper, A. A. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3845-3850; Moehring, J. M., and Moehring, T. J. (1976) Infect. Immun. 13, 221-228). The inactivation of protein synthesis in diphtheria toxin-treated L cells is characterized by first order inactivation kinetics and a concentration-dependent lag phase. The log rate of inactivation of protein synthesis when plotted versus toxin concentration yields a complex hyperbola with a saturable component detected in the range of 5 to 10 X 10(-5) M. We conclude that the intoxication of L cells by diphtheria toxin in the range of 10(-8) to 5 X 10(-6) M occurs via a saturable process and that the saturable component probably represents a plasma membrane toxin receptor with an affinity 200-fold lower than that found in sensitive HeLa cells. Since L cells require a 10(4)- to 10(5)-fold higher toxin dose than HeLa cells, a 200-fold affinity difference cannot fully explain the resistance of L cells to diphtheria toxin. In addition, L cells must have either fewer toxin receptors or a deficiency in the transport step(s). Because toxin-exposed L cells in contrast to sensitive cells exhibit different behavior with respect to pH and pH reversal of NH4Cl protection, a deficiency in the transport step is considered the more likely case."
https://openalex.org/W1575911069,"Abstract The spectral changes of cytochrome P-450 associated with mixed-function oxidation of hexobarbital and aminopyrine were investigated in perfused rat liver, using reflectance spectrophotometry. Simultaneously, the oxidation-reduction state of pyridine nucleotide(s) and oxygen uptake were measured from the same liver. Difference spectra were observed after infusion of hexobarbital or aminopyrine. Spectra obtained from livers of fasted, sodium phenobarbital-treated rats were similar to those of cytochrome P-450 . substrate complex (type I); the spectrum from fed, sodium phenobarbital-treated rats was a mixture of substrate . cytochrome P-450 complex and reduced (an oxygenated) cytochrome P-450. In fed, sodium phenobarbital-treated rats, the steady state level of reduced (an oxygenated) cytochrome P-450 was dependent on the concentration and the kind of substrates added, and the level correlated well with mixed-function oxidase activity. In the absence of exogenous substrates, the degree of the formation of reduced (an oxygenated) cytochrome P-450 was small. These results indicate that mixed-function oxidase activity in the intact cell is regulated by substrate-binding to cytochrome P-450. In fasted, sodium phenobarbital-treated rats, a substantial oxidation of pyridine nucleotide was observed in the presence of hexobarbital. The increase of oxygen uptake was a 2- to 2.5-fold smaller rate than in livers from fed, sodium phenobarbital-treated rats. Infusion of sorbitol (2 mM), a glycogenic substrate in fasted rats, stimulated oxygen uptake about 3-fold. Furthermore, reduced (an oxygenated) cytochrome P-450 increased in the presence of sorbitol. These results indicate that the rate of NADPH supply is rate-limiting for mixed-function oxidation in livers of fasted, sodium phenobarbital-treated rats. Finally, the difference spectrum of cytochrome P-450, the surface fluorescence of pyridine nucleotide, and the oxygen uptake were compared using livers from untreated, alloxan-treated and sodium phenobarbital-treated rats."
https://openalex.org/W1604422815,"The binding of 125I-asialoorosomucoid and the isolated rabbit hepatic lectin were studied at 0 degrees C. The steady state binding data were analyzed both by a direct curve-fitting procedure that utilizes nonlinear least squares regression analysis, and by conventional Scatchard plot analysis. Two classes of binding sites, present in approximately equal concentrations, were detected by both analytical procedures. The total amount of 125I-asialoorosomucoid bound was between 0.2 and 1.0 mol/mol of lectin for each class of lectin binding sites, if the molecular weight of the lectin is between 100,000 and 500,000. The estimated apparent equilibrium dissociation constants were Kapp = 0.87 nM and 1100 nM using the direct curve-fitting method and 0.63 nM and 43 nM from Scatchard plot analysis. Analysis of the forward binding reaction yielded apparent rate constants k1 = 6.8 X 10(6) M-1 and k-1 = 1.5 X 10(-2) min-1, and, therefore, Kapp = 2.1 nM. (Kapp is the apparent dissociation constant of the complex between asialoorosomucoid and hepatic lectin, K1 is the bimolecular rate constant for association of asialoorosomucoid and hepatic lectin, and K-1 is the rate constant for dissociation of the asialoorosomucoid-hepatic lectin complex.) In contrast, the reverse reaction was too slow in the presence of excess unlabeled asialoorosomucoid, and too fast in the presence of methyl beta-D-galactopyranoside to be accommodated by the simple bimolecular reaction model."
https://openalex.org/W1487437829,"The effect of erythropoietin on the synthesis of the proteins characteristic of mature erythrocyte membranes was studied in cultures of bone marrow cells from adult, polycythemic rats. Stimulated synthesis of the major glycoprotein, glycophorin, was maximal at 30 h and fell to control level by 66 h. Stimulated synthesis of the major integral membrane protein, band 3, occurred at about 18 h was maximal at 66 h, and fell to control level by 114 h. In contrast, stimulated hemoglobin synthesis did not start until after 24 h, was maximal at 96 h, and was at control level at 114 h. Erythropoietin had, in addition, a transient effect on the synthesis of some membrane proteins found in marrow cells but not in mature red cells."
https://openalex.org/W1525866540,"Earlier we described the synthesis of a toxic, disulfide-linked conjugate between Fragment A from diphtheria toxin (DTA) and the lectin concanavalin A (Con A). Here we report further characterization of this Con A-SS-DTA conjugate and of a nontoxic conjugate containing DTA linked through a disulfide bridge to the binding subunit of ricin toxin, RTB. The Con A-SS-DTA conjugate preparation was heterogeneous, and contained both divalent and tetravalent forms of Con A linked to DTA. The divalent form of the conjugate, which lacked hemagglutination activity, was as toxic as the tetravalent form for 3T3 cells. Consistent with this result, Con A-SS-DTA analogs prepared with the chemically modified dimeric derivatives of Con A, succinyl-Con A and acetyl-Con A, were as toxic as DTA disulfide linked to tetravalent Con A. Two analogs of Con A-SS-DTA containing nonreducible intermolecular linkages between DTA and Con A were at least 1000-fold less toxic than Con A-SS-DTA, although they were indistinguishable from unmodified Con A in binding to 3T3 cells. This suggests that reduction of the disulfide bridge between Con A and DTA may be necessary for conjugate toxicity. Con A-SS-DTA was equally toxic for a variety of cell lines varying in sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, including Vero, CHO, HeLa, and 3T3. The conjugate was also toxic for a diphtheria toxin-resistant variant of V79 cells (V79 Dtxr-3) that has lower affinity than wild type cells for diphtheria toxin. Chloroquine, colchicine, cytochalasin B, and ammonium chloride had no effect on Con A-SS-DTA toxicity for Vero cells, although ammonium chloride and chloroquine inhibited diphtheria toxin action."
