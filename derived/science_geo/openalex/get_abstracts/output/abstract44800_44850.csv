https://openalex.org/W2007027096,"Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) is a 90 kd inducible surface glycoprotein that promotes adhesion in immunological and inflammatory reactions. ICAM-1 is a ligand of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), an alpha beta complex that is a member of the integrin family of cell-cell and cell-matrix receptors. ICAM-1 is encoded by an inducible 3.3 kb mRNA. The amino acid sequence specifies an integral membrane protein with an extracellular domain of 453 residues containing five immunoglobulin-like domains. Highest homology is found with neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which also contain five Ig-like domains. NCAM and MAG are nervous system adhesion molecules, but unlike ICAM-1, NCAM is homophilic. The ICAM-1 and LFA-1 interaction is heterophilic and unusual in that it is between members of the immunoglobulin and intergrin families. Unlike other integrin ligands, ICAM-1 does not contain an RGD sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2037824747,"We have characterized three distinct proteins present in HeLa cell extracts that specifically recognize different subsets of transcriptional elements containing the pentanucleotide sequence CCAAT. One of these CCAAT-binding proteins, CP1, binds with high affinity to CCAAT elements present in the human alpha-globin promoter and the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP). A second protein, CP2, binds with high affinity to a CCAAT element present in the rat gamma-fibrinogen promoter. Finally, the third CCAAT-binding protein is nuclear factor I (NF-I), a cellular DNA-binding protein that binds to the adenovirus origin of replication and is required for the initiation of adenoviral replication. CP1, CP2, and NF-I are distinct activities in that each binds to its own recognition site with an affinity that is at least three orders of magnitude higher than that with which it binds to the recognition sites of the other two proteins. Surprisingly, CP1, CP2, and NF-I each appear to recognize their binding site with highest affinity as a multisubunit complex composed of heterologous subunits. In the case of CP1, two different types of subunits form a stable complex in the absence of a DNA-binding site. Moreover, both subunits are present in the CP1-DNA complex. We thus propose the existence of a family of related multisubunit CCAAT-binding proteins that are composed of heterologous subunits."

https://openalex.org/W2029750351,"Isolated human mitochondria containing a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) coded chloramphenicol resistance marker were injected into cells from two different human sensitive cell lines, 143BTK- and HT1080-6TG, which had been partially depleted of their mtDNA by ethidium bromide treatment. On the basis of the available evidence concerning the tolerance of introduced volumes into mammalian cells, it is estimated that, on the average, less than one mitochondrion was introduced into each cell. Under selective conditions, the mitochondria became established in the recipient cells with a frequency greater than 2-3 x 10(-3). An analysis of multiple mtDNA and nuclear DNA polymorphisms revealed a rapid replacement of the resident mtDNA by the exogenous mtDNA. Six to ten weeks after microinjection, this replacement was complete in all but one of the HT1080-6TG transformants, and nearly complete in the majority of the 143BTK- transformants. The quantitative behavior of the mtDNA of the transformants at very early stages of selection strongly suggests that intracellular mtDNA selection played a crucial role in this replacement, with significant implications for mitochondrial genetics."

https://openalex.org/W2089017374,"Complementary DNA clones were isolated that represent the 5â€² terminal 2.5 kilobases of the murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Dmd) messenger RNA (mRNA). Mouse Dmd mRNA was detectable in skeletal and cardiac muscle and at a level approximately 90 percent lower in brain. Dmd mRNA is also present, but at much lower than normal levels, in both the muscle and brain of three different strains of dystrophic mdx mice. The identification of Dmd mRNA in brain raises the possibility of a relation between human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene expression and the mental retardation found in some DMD males. These results also provide evidence that the mdx mutations are allelic variants of mouse Dmd gene mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1921601722,"The relationship between apoB-100 and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been studied by a combination of pulse-chase methodology and subcellular fractionation. HepG2 cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 3 min and chased with cold methionine for periods between 0 and 20 min. ApoB-100 and albumin, present in the membrane as well as in the luminal content of the ER vesicles, were isolated after each chase period. The results indicated that apoB-100 was cotranslationally bound to the membrane of the ER, and from this membrane-bound form, was transferred to the lumen after a delay of 10-15 min. Albumin was, as could be expected for a typical secretory protein, cotranslationally sequestered in the lumen of the ER. Apo-B-100-containing lipoproteins present in the microsomal lumen were analyzed by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient. ApoB-100 occurred on rounded particles in three density regions: (i) d 1.1065-1.170 g/ml (Fraction I), (ii) d 1.011-1.045 g/ml (Fraction II), and (iii) d less than 1.011 g/ml (Fraction III). Fraction I, isolated from cells cultured in the absence of oleic acid, contained a homogenous population of particles with a mean diameter of approximately 200 A. Fraction I isolated from cells cultured in the presence of oleic acid was slightly more heterogeneous and had a mean diameter of approximately 250 A. Fractions II and III had mean diameters of 300 and 500 A, respectively. Cholesterol esters and triacylglycerol were the quantitatively dominating lipid constituents of all three fractions. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that Fraction I contained the newly assembled lipoproteins. With increasing chase time, the apoB-100 radioactivity was redistributed from Fraction I to Fractions II and III, indicating that Fraction I is converted into Fractions II and III during the intracellular transfer. Particles corresponding to Fractions II and III were by far the most abundant lipoproteins found in the medium. The results presented support the possibility of a sequential assembly of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2070701919,"Using retroviral recombination substrates, we investigated the developmental stage of expression of V(D)J recombinase activity and the activation of recombinase activity in nonlymphoid cells. V(D)J recombinase activity was detected only in pre-B cells, but a DNA transfer protocol successfully activated V(D)J recombination in an NIH 3T3 cell line. The V(D)J recombinase activity was transferred in a second round of transfection and was then stably expressed in fibroblasts at a level comparable to that of a recombinationally active pre-B cell. It is likely that expression of a single, lymphoid-specific gene in a fibroblast is sufficient to confer V(D)J recombinase activity on that cell."
https://openalex.org/W1512614115,"Abstract Golgi membranes from rat liver have been shown to contain an endo-alpha-D-mannosidase which can convert Glc1Man9GlcNAc to Man8GlcNAc with the release of Glc alpha 1----3Man (Lubas, W. A., and Spiro, R. G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 3775-3781). We now report that this enzyme has the capacity to cleave the alpha 1----2 linkage between the glucose-substituted mannose residue and the remainder of the polymannose branch in a wide range of oligosaccharides (Glc3Man9GlcNAc to Glc1Man4GlcNAc) as well as glycopeptides and oligosaccharide-lipids. Whereas the tri- and diglucosylated species (Glc3Man9GlcNAc and Glc2Man9GlcNAc), which yielded Glc3Man and Glc2Man, respectively, were processed more slowly than Glc1Man9GlcNAc, the monoglucosylated components with truncated mannose chains (Glc1Man8GlcNAc to Glc1Man4GlcNAc) were trimmed at an increased rate which was inversely related to the number of mannose residues present. The endomannosidase was not inhibited by a number of agents which are known to interfere with N-linked oligosaccharide processing by exoglycosidases, including 1-deoxynojirimycin, castanospermine, bromoconduritol, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, swainsonine, and EDTA. However, Tris and other buffers containing primary hydroxyl groups substantially decreased its activity. After Triton solubilization, the endomannosidase was observed to be bound to immobilized wheat germ agglutinin, indicating the presence of a type of carbohydrate unit consistent with Golgi localization of the enzyme. The Man8GlcNAc isomer produced by endomannosidase action was found to be processed by Golgi enzymes through a different sequence of intermediates than the rough endoplasmic reticulum-generated Man8GlcNAc variant, in which the terminal mannose of the middle branch is absent. Whereas the latter oligosaccharide is converted to Man5GlcNAc via Man7GlcNAc and Man6GlcNAc at an even rate, the processing of the endomannosidase-derived Man8GlcNAc stalls at the Man6GlcNAc stage due to the apparent resistance to Golgi mannosidase I of the alpha 1,2-linked mannose of the middle branch. The results of our study suggest that the Golgi endomannosidase takes part in a processing route for N-linked oligosaccharides which have retained glucose beyond the rough endoplasmic reticulum; the distinctive nature of this pathway may influence the ultimate structure of the resulting carbohydrate units."
https://openalex.org/W1484991497,"The kinetics of the assembly of the prothrombinase complex was studied using factor Xa modified with the active site-directed fluorophore dansylglutamylglycylarginyl chloromethyl ester (DEGR.Xa) as a reporter for the process. Stopped-flow kinetic studies of prothrombinase assembly were undertaken at saturating concentrations of calcium ion, using vesicles composed of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (PCPS), factor Va, and DEGR.Xa. The rate of complex formation, studied under pseudo first-order conditions, depended on the premixing protocol used to initiate complex assembly and was most rapid when prothrombinase assembly was initiated by reacting Va with the preformed DEGR.Xa.PCPS complex. Under these conditions, reaction rate was linearly dependent on the concentration of PCPS with no evidence for saturation and was independent of the concentration of VA. Essentially identical reaction rates were observed when the association of Va with PCPS was independently assessed by stopped-flow light scattering. The data indicate that prothrombinase assembly initiated by mixing Va with the DEGR.Xa.PCPS complex is rate limited by the initial reaction between Va and available combining sites on the vesicle surface (k = 5.7 x 10(7) M-1.s-1) followed by extremely rapid reactions (k greater than 1 x 10(9) M-1.s-1) between PCPS-bound DEGR.Xa and PCPS-bound Va. The formation of a separate Va.PCPS complex is therefore required for prothrombinase assembly to proceed. Reaction rates obtained when prothrombinase assembly was initiated by reacting DEGR.Xa with the preformed Va.PCPS complex or by reacting PCPS with a mixture of DEGR.Xa and Va were lower. Under these initiation conditions, reaction rates were inhibited by increasing concentrations of factor Va. These data indicate that the formation of the DEGR.Xa.PCPS binary complex is also a prerequisite for prothrombinase assembly. The second-order rate constant for the reaction between factor Xa and PCPS (k = 2.9 x 10(7) M-1.s-1) and the first-order rates of dissociation of the Va.PCPS complex (koff = 0.17 s-1) and the Xa.PCPS complex (koff = 3.3 s-1) were independently determined by stopped-flow light scattering. Collectively, the data are consistent with the interpretation that prothrombinase assembly proceeds via the initial formation of separate Xa.PCPS and Va. PCPS binary complexes at near diffusion-limited rates on the same vesicle. The lipid-bound constituents then react rapidly via rearrangements on the vesicle surface to form prothrombinase."
https://openalex.org/W1640074353,"Type IV collagen has the ability to self-assemble by amino end, carboxyl end, and lateral associations to complex network-like structures which can be visualized by rotary shadowing. The main noncollagenous NC1 domain which is located at the carboxyl end of type IV collagen molecules binds to itself to form dimers and also binds along the length of type IV collagen. The latter binding initiates lateral assembly. Following in vitro nonenzymatic glucosylation of the isolated NC1 domain, binding to the helix-rich domain of type IV collagen was impaired. In turbidity experiments, the nonenzymatically glucosylated NC1 domain minimally suppressed the development of turbidity of collagen solutions when compared to control NC1 domain. In rotary shadowing experiments nonenzymatically glucosylated NC1 domain did not significantly inhibit lateral associations or networks formed by type IV collagen, whereas control NC1 domain caused a drastic decrease in laterally assembled structures. These data suggest that nonenzymatic glucosylation of the NC1 domain may interfere with normal assembly of type IV collagen in diabetes mellitus and may be related to abnormal functions of basement membranes in this pathological condition."
https://openalex.org/W1601237905,"MAM-6 is a major epithelial sialomucin which is abundantly present at the apical surface of ductal and alveolar cells of normal tissues and on many different carcinoma cells. MAM-6, as defined by monoclonal antibodies, consists of one or two sialylated glycoproteins with apparent molecular masses of over 400 kDa under reducing as well as nonreducing conditions. The mobility and number of glycoproteins immunoprecipitated vary depending on the cell line of origin. We have employed immunoprecipitation techniques to study the biosynthesis and glycosylation of this mucin. The biosynthesis of MAM-6 was studied in the ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell line. Two glycoproteins with apparent molecular masses of approximately 450 and 650 kDa, representing the mature form, were immunoprecipitated. By pulse-chase analysis, we show that the biosynthesis of the 450-kDa glycoprotein proceeded through intermediates of 220, 200, and 500 kDa which became perceptible after 1, 4, and 30 min, respectively. The biosynthesis of the 650-kDa glycoprotein followed a similar course through 380, 350, and 700-kDa intermediates. The processing of the 220- and 350-kDa precursors involves a rare proteolytic cleavage step which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. The late precursors of 500/700 kDa, observed after 30 min chase, and the mature glycoproteins were generated by extensive O-linked glycosylation. The formation of the 500/700-kDa precursors was not affected by monensin. However, the final step of maturation, sialylation of the 500/700-kDa precursors, could be inhibited by monensin. The extensive O-linked glycosylation causes the apparent high molecular weight as observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Our data on the biosynthesis show that the early MAM-6 precursors contain N-linked glycans, suggesting the presence of N-linked glycans on the mature MAM-6 molecule. Although the copresence of N- and O-linked glycans has been found on many molecules, no N-linked glycans have been reported on mucus glycoproteins previously."
https://openalex.org/W1495919075,"5-Enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase is an enzyme of the shikimate pathway which is located in the chloroplasts in higher plants. This enzyme is the target of the nonselective herbicide glyphosate. We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding EPSP synthase from petunia and tomato. The deduced amino acid sequences of the two enzyme precursors show 93% identity in the mature protein regions and 58% identity in the transit peptides. The sequences of the plant enzymes show significantly greater similarity to bacterial EPSP synthases than to fungal EPSP synthases. A genomic clone containing an EPSP synthase gene was isolated from a library of petunia DNA and was shown to contain seven intervening sequences. This gene is expressed approximately 25-fold higher in flower petals than in other organs of petunia. Transcription of this gene is initiated at multiple sites in petunia leaves and in a glyphosate-tolerant petunia cell line overproducing EPSP synthase mRNA. In petals, however, transcription of this gene is initiated almost entirely from only one of these sites. In contrast to petunia, the levels of EPSP synthase mRNA in different organs of tomato do not differ significantly."
https://openalex.org/W1548569239,"We have cloned the cDNA encoding a new isozyme of glycogen phosphorylase (1,4-D-glucan:orthosphosphate D-glucosyltransferase, EC 2.4.1.1) from a cDNA library prepared from a human brain astrocytoma cell line. Blot-hybridization analysis reveals that this message is preferentially expressed in human brain, but is also found at a low level in human fetal liver and adult liver and muscle tissues. Although previous studies have suggested that the major isozyme of phosphorylase found in all fetal tissues is the brain type, our data show that the predominant mRNA in fetal liver (24-week gestation) is the adult liver form. The protein sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the brain phosphorylase cDNA is 862 amino acids long compared with 846 and 841 amino acids for the liver and muscle isozymes, respectively; the greater length of brain phosphorylase is entirely due to an extension at the far C-terminal portion of the protein. The muscle and brain isozymes share greater identity with regard to nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences, codon usage, and nucleotide composition than either do with the liver sequence, suggesting a closer evolutionary relationship between them. Spot blot hybridization of the brain phosphorylase cDNA to laser-sorted human chromosome fractions, and Southern blot analysis of hamster/human hybrid cell line DNA reveals that the exact homolog of the newly cloned cDNA maps to chromosome 20, but that a slightly less homologous gene is found on chromosome 10 as well. The liver and muscle genes have previously been localized to chromosomes 14 and 11, respectively. This suggests that the phosphorylase genes evolved by duplication and translocation of a common ancestral gene, leading to divergence of elements controlling gene expression and of structural features of the phosphorylase proteins that confer tissue-specific functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W1564619302,"The gamma-glutamyl peptide induced in Schizosaccharomyces pombe in response to metal stress has been purified following exposure of the organism to cadmium and copper salts. Induction of the peptide enables S. pombe to proliferate in media containing high concentrations of cadmium and copper. Two Cd-gamma-Glu peptide complexes are produced which differ in the content of acid-labile sulfur. One Cu-gamma-Glu peptide complex is induced, and it lacks acid-labile sulfur in the metal-binding cluster. The peptides are composed of repeating dipeptide units of gamma-Glu-Cys with a carboxyl-terminal glycine with heterogeneity observed in the repeat unit n. The number of repeats averages 3.2 and 3.8 for the Cd-peptides I and II and 3.6 for the Cu-peptide, in the case of the Cu-complex peptides with n values from 2 to 4 were separated by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The Cu-gamma-Glu peptide complex is oligomeric, but the exact number of peptide units per complex is not known. The copper binding stoichiometry averages 2.3 g atoms of Cu/mol of peptide, whereas Cd-peptides I and II average 1.8 and 2.7 mol eq of Cd(II)/peptide unit. The pH of half-dissociation of Cu ions from the gamma-Glu peptide is near 1.3, whereas pH values of 4 and 5.4 are sufficient for half-displacement of Cd ions from the sulfide-containing and -lacking peptides II and I, respectively. In the Cu-peptide complex copper is bound as Cu(I) as the complex exhibits luminescence characteristic of Cu(I)-S chelation. The luminescence emission peaks at 619 nm with a corrected excitation peak centered at 290 nm. The luminescence of the Cu-complex indicates the clustering of Cu(I) ions within a solvent-inaccessible complex. The complex is air-labile as the luminescence emission is gradually lost upon air exposure."
https://openalex.org/W1482108000,"A chemical cross-linking approach has been used to characterize the interaction of platelets with small peptides of 7 and 14 residues containing the arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD) sequence recognized by a variety of cellular adhesion receptors. The radioiodinated peptides were bound to platelets, and chemical cross-linking was attained by subsequent addition of bifunctional reagents. Three different cross-linking reagents coupled the RGD-containing peptides to platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb-IIIa (GPIIb-IIIa), and both subunits of this platelet membrane glycoprotein became radiolabeled with the RGD peptides. Platelet stimulation with agonists including thrombin, phorbol myristrate acetate, and ADP increased the extent of cross-linking by predominantly enhancing the coupling of the RGD peptides to the GPIIIa subunit. Cross-linking of the labeled RGD peptides to GPIIb and GPIIIa on stimulated and nonstimulated platelets exhibited structural specificity and was inhibited by excess nonlabeled RGD peptides. The interactions were inhibited by nonlabeled RGD peptides and a peptide with an amino acid sequence corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the gamma chain of fibrinogen but less effectively by an arginyl-glycyl-glutamic acid peptide. Cross-linking of the RGD peptides to GPIIb-IIIa was divalent ion-dependent and, on stimulated platelets, was inhibited by the adhesive proteins fibrinogen and fibronectin, but not by albumin. These results indicate that the RGD-binding sites on platelets reside in close proximity to both subunits of GPIIb-IIIa and that platelet stimulation alters the topography of these sites such that the peptides become more efficiently cross-linked to GPIIIa."
https://openalex.org/W1580686692,"Protoporhyrinogen oxidase (EC 1.3.3.4), the penultimate enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, catalyzes the removal of six hydrogens from protoporphyrinogen IX to form protoporphyrin IX. The enzyme in eukaryotes is associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the present study we have examined requirements for solubilization of this enzyme and find that it behaves as an intrinsic membrane protein that is solubilized only with detergents such as sodium cholate. The in situ orientation of the enzyme with respect to the inner mitochondrial membrane places the active site on the cytosolic face of this membrane rather than the matrix side where the active site of ferrochelatase, the terminal pathway enzyme, is located. Examination of the kinetics of the two terminal enzymes in mitochondrial membranes demonstrates that substrate channeling occurs between these terminal two-pathway enzymes. However, examination of solubilized and membrane-reconstituted enzymes shows no evidence for a stable complex. Based upon these and previous data a model for the terminal three-pathway enzymes is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1564273292,"The structure of horse heart metmyoglobin has been determined with a molecular replacement approach and subsequently refined using rigid body and restrained-parameter least squares methods to a conventional crystallographic R-factor of 0.16 for all observed reflections in the 6.0-2.8-A resolution range. The polypeptide chain of this protein is found to be organized into eight helical regions (labeled A-H) which collectively form a hydrophobic pocket in which the heme prosthetic group is bound. Our results show that the overall thermal motions of individual residues of horse heart metmyoglobin are correlated with their mean distances from the heme group. In comparisons with the structure of sperm whale metmyoglobin it has been found that horse heart metmyoglobin has unique polypeptide chain conformations in four regions. These include residues in the immediate vicinity of the amino and carboxyl termini, residues about Lys-16, and residues 117-124 which are in the interhelical region between helices G and H. Many of these conformational changes appear to occur as a consequence of a different pattern of salt-bridging interactions between charged residues on the surface of horse heart metmyoglobin. The overall average positional deviation observed between corresponding alpha-carbons in the polypeptide chains of horse heart and sperm whale metmyoglobin is 0.50 A. This value for atoms of the porphyrin core of the central heme group is 0.39 A. A total of 12 well defined water molecules and 1 sulfate ion are included in the current structural model of horse heart metmyoglobin. One of these water molecules is found to be coordinated to the heme iron atom and hydrogen bonded to the side chain of His-64. The sulfate ion is hydrogen bonded to amide groups at the amino-terminal end of the E-helix and, as well, forms similar interactions with the amino-terminal end of the D-helix of an adjacent protein molecule in the crystalline lattice."
https://openalex.org/W1494876798,"Inhibitors of endocytosis have been used to show that internalization of superoxide dismutase is required for the enzyme to protect hepatocytes from the cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide. As shown previously (Starke, P. E., and Farber, J. L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 10099-10104), superoxide dismutase prevented the killing of cultured hepatocytes by H2O2 generated in the medium by glucose oxidase. Five inhibitors of endocytosis, methylamine, monensin, benzyl alcohol, cytochalasin B, and oligomycin, each abolished the protective effect of superoxide dismutase. Cell-associated superoxide dismutase activity was increased 4-fold in hepatocytes after exposure to superoxide dismutase for 1 h. Each of the inhibitors abolished this increase in the cell-associated superoxide dismutase activity. The uptake of horseradish peroxidase, a measure of fluid phase endocytosis, differed from that of superoxide dismutase in its lower rate, reduced sensitivity to methylamine, and its insensitivity to cytochalasin B. The results of the present study demonstrate that endocytosis of superoxide dismutase is required to protect hepatocytes from the cytotoxicity of hydrogen peroxide. This conclusion may account for some of the conflicting results in the literature with respect to the protective action of superoxide dismutase."
https://openalex.org/W1592957780,"The production of tropoelastin isoforms was examined by cell-free translation of nuchal ligament RNA from cows of various ages ranging from 110 days of gestation to adult. Tropoelastin polypeptides synthesized in vitro were immunoprecipitated with a specific monoclonal antibody and separated by high resolution sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. From these experiments three distinct tropoelastin isoform patterns were detected at different developmental periods. 1) The fetal period was characterized by three polypeptides of about 67, 65, and 63 kDa produced in a ratio of 1:3:2. 2) In neonatal tissue, the same molecular mass forms were detected; however, the relative isoform ratio changed to 2:3:1. 3) From adult ligament RNA, only the 67- and 65-kDa forms of tropoelastin were detected, and these were produced in equal amounts. The pattern of tropoelastin isoforms produced from RNA isolated from other fetal elastic tissues was the same as for fetal ligament. Additional studies demonstrated that the relative amount of functional tropoelastin mRNA correlated with steady state levels of mRNA consistent with transcriptional regulation of tropoelastin synthesis. Although the significance of developmental switching of individual tropoelastin isoforms is unknown, it is likely that this process is required for proper assembly and, thus, function of elastic tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1520190004,"Testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase activities and its mRNA levels are higher in kidneys than in livers from male 129/J mice. Castration of 129/J male mice resulted in repression of P-450(15 alpha) in kidney, but increased it in liver. Two types of cDNA (p15 alpha-29 (Type I) and -15 (Type II)) encoding P-450(15 alpha) were previously cloned from 129/J female livers (Burkhart, B.A., Harada, N., and Negishi, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 15357-15361). With the use of p15 alpha-29 as a probe, Type I and II P-450(15 alpha) cDNAs were isolated from libraries of 129/J kidney poly(A)+ RNA. The nucleotide sequences of the cDNAs showed that Type I and II cDNAs from liver and kidney were identical and shared 98.3% similarity. The deduced amino acid sequence from a full-length Type I cDNA indicated that Type I P-450(15 alpha) consists of 494 amino acids with a molecular weight of 56,594. Nine amino acid substitutions were found in the Type II clone in 432 amino acids overlapping Type I. Type I cDNA clones accounted for approximately 90% P-450(15 alpha) clones isolated from a male kidney library, whereas approximately 90% of cDNA clones in a female kidney library were Type II. Liver cDNA libraries from males and females contained similar ratios of Type I and II. Effects of castration on Type I and II mRNAs were determined by Southern hybridization of a 32P-labeled ClaI-ClaI fragment from p15 alpha-29 to cDNAs synthesized from kidney and liver poly(A)+ RNAs prepared from sham-operated, castrated 129/J mice. The double-stranded cDNAs were digested with ClaI and PstI prior to gel electrophoresis to create the diagnostic restriction fragments specific for Type I or II. Castration resulted in decreased levels of Type I mRNA in male kidney. In male liver, only Type I mRNA rose significantly in response to castration. Testosterone administration returned the Type I mRNA to normal levels in castrated mice. It therefore appears that the high levels of P-450(15 alpha) in male kidney were due to androgen-dependent induction of Type I mRNA. Both Types I and II were repressed in male liver, which results in decreased levels of P-450(15 alpha). Androgen was responsible for the repression and expression of Type I in liver and kidney, but not Type II."
https://openalex.org/W1925941809,"We have investigated polyamine metabolism in primary cultures of mouse epidermal cells. These cells, which grow at low Ca2+ levels as a monolayer with characteristics of basal cells, terminally differentiate when the extracellular Ca2+ level is raised above 1 mM. The cellular levels of free polyamines were measured, and, after incubation of cell cultures with [3H]putrescine, the distribution of label in both acid-soluble and acid-insoluble cellular components was examined. Free polyamine levels were reduced in cells induced to differentiate. Treatment with retinoic acid, which prevents differentiation and causes increased proliferation, resulted in an increase in free putrescine. Upon adjustment of the calcium concentration to a level that induces differentiation, the enzyme transglutaminase was activated, and a concomitant increase in the level of both protein-bound mono- and bis-gamma-glutamyl derivatives of putrescine and spermidine was observed. Isolation of a material of apparent molecular weight about 6000 which contains only mono-gamma-glutamylpolyamines and the finding of both mono- and bis-gamma-glutamylpolyamines in the protein fraction containing cornified cell envelopes provided the basis for speculation on polyamines in envelope formation. Our data suggest that polyamines play a role during epidermal cell differentiation through transglutaminase-mediated post-translational modification."
https://openalex.org/W1606017721,"Complementary DNA (cDNA) clones encoding a transcription factor S-II were isolated and characterized. The primary structure of S-II was determined by nucleotide sequence analysis of these clones. The predicted primary structure was consistent with the model that we proposed previously from the results of biochemical analyses of S-II. Using these clones as probes, we analyzed the mRNA for S-II. RNA blot analysis demonstrated the presence of four species of mRNA that hybridized with S-II cDNA in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. This is the first evidence of polymorphism of mRNA encoding a transcription factor of RNA polymerase II. The results of analysis of the genomic structure suggested that the polymorphism of mRNA may be due to alternative splicing, or differences in initiation or termination of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1604012490,"We are interested in determining whether incorporation of the drug 5-fluorouracil into pre-mRNA can alter RNA processing. The effect of 5-fluorouracil (FUra) substitution on the in vitro splicing of pre-mRNA was studied. 32P-Labeled human beta-globin pre-mRNA containing the first two exons and the first intervening sequence was synthesized in the presence of UTP, FUTP, or both. In vitro splicing reactions generated several abnormal intermediates and products from FUra-substituted transcripts. The appearance of a new minor spliced product was dependent on both the pH of the splicing reaction and the extent of FUra incorporation into pre-mRNA. Abnormal splicing was observed at pH 8.4 and 7.7 but not at pH 6.7. The new minor spliced product was sequenced and found to contain an additional 20 bases derived from the 3'-end of the intervening sequence. The abnormally migrating intermediate had the same structure as the normal lariat-exon intermediate. These results suggest that FUra substitution into pre-mRNA can alter splicing in vitro."

https://openalex.org/W1659311663,"A ferredoxin, which functions as an electron acceptor for the CO dehydrogenase complex from Methanosarcina thermophila, was purified from acetate-grown cells. It was isolated as a trimer having a native molecular weight of approximately 16,400 and monomer molecular weight of 4,888 calculated from the amino acid composition. The ferredoxin contained 2.80 +/- 0.56 Fe atoms and 1.98 +/- 0.12 acid-labile sulfide. UV-visible absorption maxima were 395 and 295 nm with monomeric extinction coefficients of epsilon 395 = 12,800 M-1 cm-1 and epsilon 295 = 14,460 M-1 cm-1. The A395/A295 ratio ranged from 0.80 to 0.88. There were 5 cysteines per monomer but no methionine, histidine, arginine, or aromatic amino acids. The N-terminal amino acid sequence showed a 4-cysteine cluster with potential to coordinate a Fe:S center. The protein was stable for 30 min at 70 degrees C, but denatured during incubation at 85 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1572923215,"Partial specific volume and properties of the extended state of proteins are estimated from additivity schemes using revised amino acid and peptide data. These calculated properties are compared with the experimental data of the native state in order to assess the contribution from folding. Results of this treatment show that, in the case of partial specific volumes, there is close agreement between the two data sets for a number of proteins. The implication is that subtle compensatory contributions in volume occur during the folding process. In the case of compressibilities, however, a substantial difference is observed which is believed to arise because of the hydrophobic interior created in the native protein as a result of the folding process. Using suitable measures of protein hydrophobicities and estimates of the fraction of buried apolar residues, a micellar model of protein compressibility is proposed and tested for several proteins. Results obtained from this model show good agreement with the experimental data for the native state of a number of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1505667372,"X-ray crystallographic studies of troponin C (Herzberg, O., and James, M.N.G. (1985) Nature 313, 653-659; Sundaralingam, M., Bergstrom, R., Strasburg, G., Rao, S.T., and Roychowdhury, P. (1985a) Science 227, 945-948) have revealed a novel protein structure consisting of two globular domains, each containing two Ca2+-binding sites, connected via a nine-turn alpha-helix, three turns of which are fully exposed to solvent. Since the crystals were grown at pH approximately 5, it is of interest to determine whether this structure is applicable to the protein in solution under physiological conditions. We have used small-angle x-ray scattering to examine the solution structure of troponin C at pH 6.8 and the effect of Ca2+ on the structure. The scattering data are consistent with an elongated structure in solution with a radius of gyration of approximately 23.0 A, which is quite comparable to that computed for the crystal structure. The experimental scattering profile and the scattering profile computed from the crystal structure coordinates do, however, exhibit differences at the 40-A level. A weak Ca2+-facilitated dimerization of troponin C was observed. The data rule out large Ca2+-induced structural changes, indicating rather that the molecule with Ca2+ bound is only slightly more compact than the Ca2+-free molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1484741957,"Circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy have been used to investigate the structures of the influenza virus membrane glycoprotein hemagglutinin, acid-treated hemagglutinin, and fragments of hemagglutinin derived by proteolysis. The conformational change in hemagglutinin which occurs at the pH of membrane fusion (pH 5-6) was associated with a significant change of the environment of tyrosine residues, a change in the environment of tryptophan residues, but no changes in secondary structure. Tryptic digestion of the hemagglutinin in its low pH conformation which releases one of the subunit polypeptides (HA1) caused minimal changes in tyrosine and tryptophan environments but a small secondary structural change in HA1. The secondary structure of the remainder of the molecule (HA2) was very similar to that predicted from the known x-ray crystallographic structure of the native molecule. However, fluorescence spectroscopy indicated a tertiary change in structure in the coiled coil of alpha-helices which form the fibrous central stem of the molecule. These results are consistent with a conformational change required for membrane fusion which involves a decrease of HA1/HA1, HA1/HA2 interactions and changes in tertiary structure not accompanied by changes in secondary structure."

https://openalex.org/W1587647856,"The metabolism of 5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol-15-one has been studied after intravenous administration to bile duct-cannulated rats. Very rapid and substantial conversion of the 15-ketosterol to polar biliary metabolites was observed in both male and female rats. For example, upon intravenous injection of [4-14C]5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol-15-one to male bile duct-cannulated rats, approximately 86% of the administered 14C was recovered in bile in the first 38 h. Of the total amount of 14C recovered in bile in 38 h, approximately 50% was excreted in bile in the first 70 min and approximately 90% was excreted within 8 h after the injection of the 15-ketosterol. A substantial fraction of the polar biliary metabolites was shown to undergo enterohepatic circulation. Of the radioactivity derived from the labeled 15-ketosterol which was not recovered in bile or other excreta at 48 h after the intravenous administration of the 15-ketosterol, most (approximately 79%) was recovered in the form of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters of blood and the various tissues. The very substantial and rapid biliary excretion of polar metabolites of the 15-ketosterol (or of cholesterol derived from the 15-ketosterol), coupled with inhibition of the intestinal absorption of cholesterol by the 15-ketosterol, may contribute to the overall hypocholesterolemic action of the 15-ketosterol which has been observed in rodents and in nonhuman primates by providing a metabolic pathway(s) wherein a substantial fraction of the absorbed 15-ketosterol is rapidly removed from the body by biliary excretion in the form of polar metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1581784168,"2-Carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate is a tightly bound intermediate of the carboxylase reaction of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase. Two stereoisomers of an analog of this intermediate, 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (2CABP) and 4-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1,5-bisphosphate (4CABP), are exceptionally potent, virtually irreversible inhibitors of the spinach carboxylase, presumably due to their structural similarity to the gem-diol (hydrated carbonyl at C-3) form of the intermediate. Incubation of the enzyme with either leads to time-dependent loss of activity. Inhibition of the enzyme is biphasic, with initial dissociation constants of 0.47 and 0.19 microM and maximal rates for tight complex formation of 2.2 and 1.8 min-1 for 2CABP and 4CABP, respectively. These values give second-order rate constants for tight complex formation of 7.8 x 10(4) and 1.6 x 10(5) M-1 s-1. To determine the overall affinity of the spinach enzyme for 2CABP and 4CABP, the release rates were determined by dual isotope exchange (3H-inhibitor complex with free 14C-inhibitor). Exchange half-times of 1.82 and 530 days were observed for 4CABP and 2CABP, respectively. Overall dissociation constants of 28 pM (2.8 x 10(-11) M) and 190 fM (1.9 x 10(-13) M) were calculated from these dissociation rates together with the rates of association determined by inactivation kinetics. The difference in affinity of 2CABP and 4CABP corresponds to 2.9 kcal/mol, presumably reflecting the difference in interaction of the enzyme with the two hydroxyls of the intermediate's gem-diol. The kinetic behavior of these two inhibitors, in particular the rather slow maximal rates of association, are consistent with the expected behavior of analogs of a labile intermediate of an enzymic reaction that is far more stable than a transition state."
https://openalex.org/W1506579004,"The metabolism of 5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol-15-one, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis with marked hypocholesterolemic activity, has been studied after the intravenous administration of a mixture of [2,4-3H]5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol-15-one and [4-14C] cholesterol to a baboon. The levels of 3H in plasma which was associated with the free 15-ketosterol decreased very rapidly (T1/2 approximately 9 min) after injection of the labeled sterol. By 4 h, the level of the [3H]15-ketosterol in plasma was negligible. The rapid decrease in the levels of the free 15-ketosterol was associated with rapid formation of fatty acid esters of the 15-ketosterol. The maximum level of 3H-labeled 15-ketosteryl esters was observed at 20 min after the injection of the 15-ketosterol. Thereafter, the levels of the 15-ketosteryl esters decreased rapidly with an apparent T1/2 of approximately 3.5-4.0 h. The results also indicated rapid formation of 3H-labeled cholesterol and cholesteryl esters. Substantial formation of [3H]cholesterol was observed at 20 min after the injection of the 15-ketosterol and reached a maximum level in plasma at 2 h. The maximum levels of [3H]cholesteryl esters in plasma were observed much later. These and other findings indicated that the observed slow clearance of total 3H from plasma is a consequence of metabolism of the 15-ketosterol to cholesterol and cholesteryl esters, normal constituents of plasma whose turnover in the whole animal is known to be relatively slow."

We have used cytosolic extracts of mutant CHO-K1 cells to study the biosynthesis of diphthamide in vitro. We have identified chromatographically a precursor form of diphthamide that exists in one complementation group of mutant cells and have documented the addition of 3 methyl residues from S-adenosylmethionine to this precursor.

The detailed structure of the entire pentasaccharide has been established by high field 1H and 13C NMR, fast atom bombardment/mass spectrometry, and various specific degradations as 3,4-di-O-Me-beta-D-GlcAp-(1----3)-2,4-di-O-Me-3-C-Me-3,6-dideox yhexosyl-(1----3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1----3)-alpha-L-Rhap-( 1----2)-6-dT al; the extreme acid lability of the novel penultimate sugar presented special structural challenges. Thus, the task of defining the variable epitopes of M. avium serovariants in order to charter the epidemiology of opportunistic mycobacterial diseases continues to reveal an unexpected order of sugar diversity and complexity."

Cross-linking of 125I-bovine growth hormone to a Triton X-100-treated low density fraction isolated from livers of late pregnant rats followed by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions showed three major binders with Mr 95,000, 86,000, and 43,000 and a minor binder of Mr 55,000, after correction for bound ligand assuming a 1:1 binding ratio of ligand-receptor. The Mr 86,000, 55,000, and 43,000 species were recovered in the detergent-soluble supernatant after high-speed centrifugation, whereas the Mr 95,000 species remained Triton X-100 insoluble. Detergent-soluble 125I-bGH-receptor complexes were further analyzed by sedimentation into sucrose density gradients. The sedimentation coefficient was S20,w = 5.2 S and the partial specific volume v = 0.72 ml/g. Gel permeation chromatography on a Sepharose S-400 column indicated a Stokes radius of 61 A for the 125I-bGH-receptor-Triton X-100 complex. Based on these figures, the molecular weight of the complex was calculated as 131,100. The molecular weight of the ligand-free receptor-Triton X-100 complex was calculated as Mr 109,100. Affinity cross-linking and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the 61 A peak from Sephacryl S-400 chromatography (cf. above) showed two binding entities, one major and one minor with Mr values 86,000 and 43,000, respectively, in the absence of reductant. When electrophoresis was run in the presence of reductant the Mr 43,000 species was the major binding entity. Furthermore, two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (first dimension, nonreducing and second dimension, reducing) showed that a disulfide-linked binder at Mr 43,000 is contained within the Mr 86,000 species. As with pregnant rats, female and male rats both showed 125I-bovine growth hormone binders of Mr 95,000, 84,000, 55,000, 43,000, and additionally an Mr 35,000 binder."
https://openalex.org/W1497198058,"An RNA-excess filter hybridization assay was established to measure the absolute amount of calbindin mRNA in chick tissues. The tissue with the highest level of mRNA is intestine, followed by kidney and cerebellum; the mRNA was not detected in liver and skin. Calbindin mRNA in intestine and kidney is vitamin D-dependent. The maximum concentration of calbindin and its mRNA found after dosing vitamin D-deficient chicks with dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) is less than 5% of that found with vitamin D dosing. Secondary 1,25-(OH)2D3 stimulation produced greatly increased amounts of both calbindin mRNA and the protein, at least reaching levels similar to those found after vitamin D dosing. In this last case, each mucosal cell contains about 2000 calbindin mRNA molecules which are translated at a rate sufficient to account for the levels of calbindin found. Calbindin mRNA is translated most rapidly in the very short time periods after its release into the cytoplasm. 1,25-(OH)2D3 has two effects on calbindin mRNA formation: first, to permit the expression of the calbindin gene and a second effect, of slower onset but more persistent, which increases either the rate of calbindin gene transcription or the stability of calbindin mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1546112227,"A DNA methyltransferase of Mr = 140,000 that is active on both unmethylated and hemimethylated DNA substrates has been purified from the murine plasma-cytoma cell line MPC 11. The maximal rate of methylation was obtained with maintenance methylation of hemimethylated Micrococcus luteus or M13 DNAs. At low enzyme concentrations, the highest rate of de novo methylation occurred with single-stranded DNA or relatively short duplex DNA containing single-stranded regions. Strong substrate inhibition was observed with hemimethylated but not unmethylated DNA substrates. Fully methylated single-stranded M13 phage DNA inhibited neither the de novo nor the maintenance reactions, but unmethylated single-stranded M13 DNA strongly inhibited the maintenance reaction. The kinetics observed with hemimethylated and single-stranded substrates could be explained if the enzyme were to bind irreversibly to a DNA molecule and to aggregate if present in molar excess. Such aggregates would be required for activity upon hemimethylated but not single-stranded DNA. For de novo methylation of duplex DNA, single-stranded regions or large amounts of methyltransferase appear to be required. The relative substrate preference for the enzyme is hemimethylated DNA greater than fully or partially single-stranded DNA greater than fully duplex DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1529379280,"The amino acid sequences of five monoclonal antibodies (designated mAbs A-E) which bind to the dopaminergic D-2 antagonist, haloperidol, with a variety of affinities (Kd = 4-810 nM), have been used to build theoretical, three-dimensional, computer models of the variable region combining sites. Physiocochemical interactions which have been previously determined from in vitro binding data have been used to orient the drug molecule within the combining site model. The results indicate that hydrophobic, aromatic, and ionic amino acids are involved in specific interactions with the antagonist molecule. For example, fluorescence quenching data suggests that a tryptophan residue is intimately involved in the binding of haloperidol by mAb A. Examination of the modeled structure reveals five tryptophans within the variable fragment, only one of which (H-50) is within the classical beta-barrel binding pocket and is readily accessible to the antigen. Haloperidol's relatively electron poor fluorophenyl ring system stacks with the electron-rich tryptophan ring system at a distance of 3.3 A and in so doing, places haloperidol's positively charged piperidinyl nitrogen atom within hydrogen bond distance of the negatively charged Glu-95 and Asp-100A residues of the H3 loop (Glu-H-95 and Asp-H-100A). This type of analysis for each antibody provides an interesting profile of changes in amino acid composition and hypervariable loop length which markedly effect binding affinity and specificity for a series of proteins which have similar combining site."

A 130-kDa integral membrane glycoprotein from brush border membrane was shown to bind specifically to 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate immobilized on Affi-Gel 102 resin. The bound protein could be eluted effectively with 1 mM 4-benzamido-4'-aminostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (BADS). The 130-kDa protein did not bind to the affinity resin in the presence of 1 mM BADS or when the solubilized extract was covalently labeled with 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate (DIDS). This protein was labeled with [3H]H2DIDS, and the labeling was prevented by BADS. The 130-kDa protein did not cross-react with antibody raised against human or dog erythrocyte Band 3 protein. The 130-kDa protein was accessible to proteinase K and chymotrypsin digestion in vesicles but not to trypsin. The 130-kDa protein was sensitive to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase F treatment both in the solubilized state and in brush border membrane vesicles showing that it was a glycoprotein and that the carbohydrate was on the exterior of the vesicles. This glycoprotein was resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment suggesting a complex-type carbohydrate structure. The protein bound concanavalin A, wheat germ agglutinin, and Ricinus communis lectins, and it could be purified using wheat germ agglutinin-agarose."
https://openalex.org/W1496045335,"We have used differential polarization microscopy, which provides images of linear dichroism, to measure the percentage of aligned hemoglobin (Hb) in 1086 deoxygenated red blood cells from subjects with sickle cell anemia. The percentage was found to be only slightly dependent on the speed of deoxygenation, thus showing that the percentage of aligned Hb was thermodynamically controlled (as has been found previously for the percentage of polymerized Hb in vitro). A slight decrease in the percentage of aligned Hb due to increasing speed of deoxygenation is primarily due to the increase in the number of cells containing no detectable aligned Hb. This class of cells was also the most variable between the different subjects studied. We were able to identify two other groups of cells that contain different numbers of domains of aligned Hb and show that these groups contain statistically different percentages of aligned Hb. The differences between these classes of cells was shown to be primarily due to different numbers of initial nucleation sites within each cell. It appears that the presence of preformed nucleation sites within cells at ambient oxygen tensions results in the thermodynamic control of aligned Hb polymer."
https://openalex.org/W1519537394,"The precursor of mitochondrial aspartate aminotransferase accumulates in the cytosol of cultured chicken embryo fibroblasts if its import into mitochondria is inhibited by an uncoupling agent. However, its accumulation is limited by degradation with a half-life of only approximately 5 min (Jaussi, R., Sonderegger, P., Fluckiger, J., and Christen, P. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 13334-13340). The aim of the present study was the characterization of the proteolytic system(s) responsible for this very rapid intracellular degradation. On depleting chicken embryo fibroblasts of ATP, the rate of degradation of the precursor was lowered by approximately 70%. Chicken embryo fibroblasts depleted of divalent metal ions showed a degradative activity of 10% of the initial value. Reconstitution of these cells with Mg2+ and Ca2+ increased the degradative activity from 10 to 107 and 24%, respectively. Thiol reagents almost completely prevented the degradation, whereas specific peptide inhibitors of cysteine proteases or inhibitors of intralysosomal proteolysis decreased the rate of degradation by only approximately 30%. Inhibitors of serine proteases had little effect. No rapid degradation of the precursor was observed in crude extracts of chicken embryo fibroblasts. The data indicate that the bulk of the precursor accumulated under conditions of import block is degraded by one or several cytosolic proteases dependent on ATP, Mg2+, and thiol groups of unknown localization, conceivably by proteolytic enzymes identical with or similar to one of the high molecular weight cytosolic proteases (Waxman, L., Fagan, J.M., Tanaka, K., and Goldberg, A. L. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11994-12000). The rest of the precursor appears to be degraded by lysosomes."

https://openalex.org/W1586652555,"Some types of secretory vesicles, such as the chromaffin vesicles of the adrenal medulla, have cytochrome b561 which is believed to mediate the transfer of electrons across the vesicle membrane. To characterize the kinetics of this process, we have examined the rate of electron transfer from ascorbate trapped within chromaffin vesicle ghosts to external ferricyanide. The rate of ferricyanide reduction saturates at high ferricyanide concentrations. The reciprocal of the rate is linearly related to the reciprocal of the ferricyanide concentration. The internal ascorbate concentration affects the y intercept of this double-reciprocal plot but not the slope. These observations and theoretical considerations indicate that the slope is associated with a rate constant k1 for the oxidation of cytochrome b561 by ferricyanide. The intercept is associated with a rate constant k0 for the reduction of cytochrome b561 by internal ascorbate. From k0 and standard reduction potentials, the rate constant k-0 for the reduction of internal semidehydroascorbate by cytochrome b561 can be calculated. Under conditions prevailing in vivo, this rate of semidehydroascorbate reduction appears to be much faster than the expected rate of semidehydroascorbate disproportionation. This supports the hypothesis that cytochrome b561 functions in vivo to reduce intravesicular semidehydroascorbate thereby maintaining intravesicular ascorbic acid."
