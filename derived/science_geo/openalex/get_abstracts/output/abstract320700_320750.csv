https://openalex.org/W1968359559,"Efforts by scientists to locate the sources of copper used in ancient Mediterranean and Near Eastern cultures through comparative chemical analyses of copper ores and archeological artifacts have largely failed for various mineralogical and metallurgical reasons. The isotopic composition of lead, an element present in a minor amount in many copper ores and bronze objects, is unchanged through metallurgical processes and may in principle be used to determine the sources of the copper used in Bronze Age artifacts. Results suggest that for Late Bronze Age Crete the Laurion region in Attica, Greece, may have been a more important copper source than Cyprus."

The basis for this effect is thought to be one of substrate competition between penicillin, which is excreted by the tubules, and 4'-carboxyphenyl-methanesulfonanilide, which is essentially refractory to excretion by that transport mechanism."

In southern Texas, this heavy treatment resulted in insecticide- resistant strains of major pests which almost destroyed the industry in the late 1960's and early 1970's. An integrated insect control program based on new short-season cotton varieties and traditional cultural practices has restored production in the area. The new system has been widely implemented because it produces greater net returns by reducing the use of insecticides, fertilizer, and irrigation."

https://openalex.org/W1988642066,"The considerations involved in defining appropriate roles for the public and private sectors in agricultural research are examined with respect to mechanization, plant variety, and insecticide research and development. It is concluded that the public sector should continue to give mechanization a low priority. Varietal improvement should remain a relatively high priority until the effects of plant variety protection legislation become more apparent. Simultaneous achievement of safety, environmental, and productivity objectives in insect pest control will require that the public sector play a larger role in research and development."

https://openalex.org/W2125996987,"Early this year, the U.S. land-based force of nuclear missiles became vulnerable to a preemptive attack by the Soviet Union, as the Soviets deployed a large number of highly accurate warheads on their own missiles. They first demonstrated this capability in 1977. Since then, U.S. missile vulnerability has come to assume great importance in superpower relations. Western observers have portrayed the Soviet achievement as a sign of aggression, and made missile vulnerability into a symbol of declining American military strength. The government has proposed a vast military buildup of nuclear weapons, supposedly made necessary by this new threat. But the public is increasingly skeptical, and support for some form of arms control is growing."

This syndrome occurred following intraperitoneal inoculation of fecal material obtained from contacts and from patients with infantile paralysis in an epidemic in a rural community. When intranasal as well as intraperitoneal inoculation was practiced, the olfactory bulbs were sometimes involved."
