https://openalex.org/W2036376138,"A report of glucose translocation, an apparent exception to the hypothesis that sucrose is the major carbohydrate translocated in plants, was investigated. Carbon-14 studies of the carbohydrates in the bark of apple suggest that rather than glucose the sugar alcohol, sorbitol, in addition to sucrose, is a principal compound translocated in this species."

Indexes of precipitation in the continental United States over a continuous 50-year period, and 91-year daily histories of individual stations, reveal that heavy rains occur most frequently in the first and third weeks of the synodical month."

https://openalex.org/W1991751224,"IN a recent communication1, Dr. Kohman suggests that tektites are meteorites which originate in interstellar space and collide with the solar system. I should like to direct attention again to the various facts that must be explained by any acceptable postulated history of these objects. (1) Tektites have chemical compositions remarkably similar to those of the more acid sedimentary rocks. This is true for the major and minor constituents. (I have been privileged to see analyses as yet unpublished on these minor constituents.) Such a chemical composition is not produced by any other naturally occurring chemical processes that we know of, except perhaps in very rare and special circumstances. (2) Tektites obviously have been melted, and this means that a temperature of some 1,500Â° C. or more was supplied by some means. In fact some appear to have been reheated to the melting point by passage through gas or by a blast of gas over the object. No terrestrial source of heat is known which could produce such high temperatures. (3) They are distributed thinly over areas of hundreds and thousands of kilometres in linear dimensions. (4) They are reported to contain aluminium-26 and beryllium-10. This observation is due to Dr. Kohman and Dr. Ehmann."

https://openalex.org/W2074619385,Salmonella spp. occur abundantly in the feces of the turtles Testudo graeca and T. hermanni but rarely in other testudines. These organisms do not seem to produce any kind of infection in the turtles. One possible explanation for the infestation is the coprophagic habit of T. graeca and T. hermanni..

https://openalex.org/W2086805958,"Cordierite-bearing, hyper-sthene-quartz monzonite porphyry, the most widespread rock unit, is intruded by biotite granite and porphyritic biotite granite. Sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks, mainly quartzites and argillites, have been metamorphosed locally to hornfels and have been involved in high-angle faulting. Shear zones are common in the plutonic rocks."
https://openalex.org/W1980328998,"Chlorambucil, 4-{p-[bis(2-chloroethyl) amino] phenyl} butyrate, administered in food to the Mexican fruit fly Anastrepha Iudens (Loew) inhibits the growth of testes and reduces egg hatch to almost nothing. Oviposition is not affected. The compound 4-amino-1H-pyrazolo (3.4-d) pyrimidine sulfate inhibits the growth of ovaries and reduces oviposition and fertility."

https://openalex.org/W2074505059,"The Clinton administration is proposing to stretch the timetable for the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC), some nuclear reactor research would be phased out, and much of the funding for defense research programs at the DOE national laboratories would be cut or shifted to nondefense labs. The timetable for the SSC would stretch the project completion date to 2003 and would increase the cost from $8.3 to $10 billion."
