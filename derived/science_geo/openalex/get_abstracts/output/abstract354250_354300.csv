https://openalex.org/W1990599339,"Single crystals of titanium dioxide (TiO2), with highly reactive surfaces, show promise for energy and environmental applications. Unfortunately, the highly reactive surfaces tend to disappear during crystal growth as a result of the minimization of surface energy. Most available samples of anatase, a naturally occurring crystalline form of TiO2, are therefore dominated (to over 90%) by thermodynamically stable {101} facets, rather than the more reactive {001} type. Hua Gui Yang et al. use hydrofluoric acid treatment of anatase TiO2 to remedy this situation. Based on theoretical predictions, they synthesized uniform anatase TiO2 single crystals containing 47% of the reactive {001} facets. This work may pave the way for the more general use of non-metallic atoms as surface controlling agents. Extensive first principles calculations carried out show that the relative stability of facets of anatase can be switched by terminating the surfaces with fluorine. It is then demonstrated that uniform anatase single crystals with a high percentage of {001} facets can be generated using hydrofluoric acid as a structure directing agent. Subsequently, surfaces can be freed of fluorine using a simple heat treatment. Owing to their scientific and technological importance, inorganic single crystals with highly reactive surfaces have long been studied1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13. Unfortunately, surfaces with high reactivity usually diminish rapidly during the crystal growth process as a result of the minimization of surface energy. A typical example is titanium dioxide (TiO2), which has promising energy and environmental applications14,15,16,17. Most available anatase TiO2 crystals are dominated by the thermodynamically stable {101} facets (more than 94 per cent, according to the Wulff construction10), rather than the much more reactive {001} facets8,9,10,11,12,13,18,19,20. Here we demonstrate that for fluorine-terminated surfaces this relative stability is reversed: {001} is energetically preferable to {101}. We explored this effect systematically for a range of non-metallic adsorbate atoms by first-principle quantum chemical calculations. On the basis of theoretical predictions, we have synthesized uniform anatase TiO2 single crystals with a high percentage (47 per cent) of {001} facets using hydrofluoric acid as a morphology controlling agent. Moreover, the fluorated surface of anatase single crystals can easily be cleaned using heat treatment to render a fluorine-free surface without altering the crystal structure and morphology."

https://openalex.org/W2032980114,"Much like high-Tc copper oxides, superconductivity in the newly discovered the rare-earth iron-based oxide systems is derived from either electron or hole doping of their non-superconducting parent compounds. The parent LaOFeAs material is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and d.c. magnetic susceptibility. While optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin-density-wave (SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping electrons to form superconductivity, there has been no direct evidence of SDW order. de la Cruz et al. report neutron-scattering experiments that demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt structural distortion below ∼150 K, followed by the development of long-range SDW-type antiferromagnetic order at ∼137 K with a small moment but simple magnetic structure. Doping the system with fluorine suppresses both the magnetic order and structural distortion in favour of superconductivity. Therefore, like high-Tc copper oxides, the superconducting regime in these iron-based materials occurs in close proximity to a long-range ordered antiferromagnetic ground state. Following the discovery of long-range antiferromagnetic order in the parent compounds of high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) copper oxides1,2, there have been efforts to understand the role of magnetism in the superconductivity that occurs when mobile ‘electrons’ or ‘holes’ are doped into the antiferromagnetic parent compounds. Superconductivity in the newly discovered rare-earth iron-based oxide systems ROFeAs (R, rare-earth metal) also arises from either electron3,4,5,6,7 or hole8 doping of their non-superconducting parent compounds. The parent material LaOFeAs is metallic but shows anomalies near 150 K in both resistivity and d.c. magnetic susceptibility3. Although optical conductivity and theoretical calculations suggest that LaOFeAs exhibits a spin-density-wave (SDW) instability that is suppressed by doping with electrons to induce superconductivity9, there has been no direct evidence of SDW order. Here we report neutron-scattering experiments that demonstrate that LaOFeAs undergoes an abrupt structural distortion below 155 K, changing the symmetry from tetragonal (space group P4/nmm) to monoclinic (space group P112/n) at low temperatures, and then, at ∼137 K, develops long-range SDW-type antiferromagnetic order with a small moment but simple magnetic structure9. Doping the system with fluorine suppresses both the magnetic order and the structural distortion in favour of superconductivity. Therefore, like high-Tc copper oxides, the superconducting regime in these iron-based materials occurs in close proximity to a long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic ground state."
https://openalex.org/W2117151438,"Brain-machine interfaces have mostly been used previously to move cursors on computer displays. Now experiments on macaque monkeys show that brain activity signals can control a multi-jointed prosthetic device in real-time. The monkeys used motor cortical activity to control a human-like prosthetic arm in a self-feeding task, with a greater sophistication of control than previously possible. This work could be important for the development of more practical neuro-prosthetic devices in the future. A system where monkeys use their motor cortical activity to control a robotic arm in a real-time self-feeding task, showing a significantly greater sophisitication of control than in previous studies, is demonstrated. This work could be important for the development of more practical neuro-prosthetic devices in the future. Arm movement is well represented in populations of neurons recorded from the motor cortex1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Cortical activity patterns have been used in the new field of brain–machine interfaces8,9,10,11 to show how cursors on computer displays can be moved in two- and three-dimensional space12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22. Although the ability to move a cursor can be useful in its own right, this technology could be applied to restore arm and hand function for amputees and paralysed persons. However, the use of cortical signals to control a multi-jointed prosthetic device for direct real-time interaction with the physical environment (‘embodiment’) has not been demonstrated. Here we describe a system that permits embodied prosthetic control; we show how monkeys (Macaca mulatta) use their motor cortical activity to control a mechanized arm replica in a self-feeding task. In addition to the three dimensions of movement, the subjects’ cortical signals also proportionally controlled a gripper on the end of the arm. Owing to the physical interaction between the monkey, the robotic arm and objects in the workspace, this new task presented a higher level of difficulty than previous virtual (cursor-control) experiments. Apart from an example of simple one-dimensional control23, previous experiments have lacked physical interaction even in cases where a robotic arm16,19,24 or hand20 was included in the control loop, because the subjects did not use it to interact with physical objects—an interaction that cannot be fully simulated. This demonstration of multi-degree-of-freedom embodied prosthetic control paves the way towards the development of dexterous prosthetic devices that could ultimately achieve arm and hand function at a near-natural level."
https://openalex.org/W1969015262,"Somatic cells can be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state through the ectopic expression of defined transcription factors. Understanding the mechanism and kinetics of this transformation may shed light on the nature of developmental potency and suggest strategies with improved efficiency or safety. Here we report an integrative genomic analysis of reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts and B lymphocytes. Lineage-committed cells show a complex response to the ectopic expression involving induction of genes downstream of individual reprogramming factors. Fully reprogrammed cells show gene expression and epigenetic states that are highly similar to embryonic stem cells. In contrast, stable partially reprogrammed cell lines show reactivation of a distinctive subset of stem-cell-related genes, incomplete repression of lineage-specifying transcription factors, and DNA hypermethylation at pluripotency-related loci. These observations suggest that some cells may become trapped in partially reprogrammed states owing to incomplete repression of transcription factors, and that DNA de-methylation is an inefficient step in the transition to pluripotency. We demonstrate that RNA inhibition of transcription factors can facilitate reprogramming, and that treatment with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors can improve the overall efficiency of the reprogramming process."
https://openalex.org/W2088017477,"With the recent recognition of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) flanking many genes, a central issue is to obtain a full understanding of their potential roles in regulated gene transcription programmes, possibly through different mechanisms. Here we show that an RNA-binding protein, TLS (for translocated in liposarcoma), serves as a key transcriptional regulatory sensor of DNA damage signals that, on the basis of its allosteric modulation by RNA, specifically binds to and inhibits CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 histone acetyltransferase activities on a repressed gene target, cyclin D1 (CCND1) in human cell lines. Recruitment of TLS to the CCND1 promoter to cause gene-specific repression is directed by single-stranded, low-copy-number ncRNA transcripts tethered to the 5' regulatory regions of CCND1 that are induced in response to DNA damage signals. Our data suggest that signal-induced ncRNAs localized to regulatory regions of transcription units can act cooperatively as selective ligands, recruiting and modulating the activities of distinct classes of RNA-binding co-regulators in response to specific signals, providing an unexpected ncRNA/RNA-binding protein-based strategy to integrate transcriptional programmes."

https://openalex.org/W2047475712,"The synthesis of the novel superconductor LaFeAsO0.89F0.11 with transition temperature Tc ∼ 26 K has been quickly followed by reports of even higher Tcs. These discoveries have generated much interest in the mechanisms and manifestations of unconventional superconductivity in the family of doped quaternary layered oxypnictides, because many features of these materials set them apart from other superconductors. Hunte et al. report very high-field resistance measurements of LaFeAsO0.89F0.11 up to 45 T, which show a remarkable enhancement of the upper critical field Bc2 as compared to values expected from the slopes dBc2/dT ≈ 2 T/K near Tc, particularly at low temperatures where the deduced Bc2(0) ≈ 63–65 T exceeds the paramagnetic limit. The recent synthesis of the superconductor LaFeAsO0.89F0.11 with transition temperature Tc ≈ 26 K (refs 1–4) has been quickly followed by reports of even higher transition temperatures in related compounds: 41 K in CeFeAsO0.84F0.16 (ref. 5), 43 K in SmFeAsO0.9F0.1 (ref. 6), and 52 K in NdFeAsO0.89F0.11 and PrFeAsO0.89F0.11 (refs 7, 8). These discoveries have generated much interest9,10 in the mechanisms and manifestations of unconventional superconductivity in the family of doped quaternary layered oxypnictides LnOTMPn (Ln: La, Pr, Ce, Sm; TM: Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; Pn: P, As), because many features of these materials set them apart from other known superconductors. Here we report resistance measurements of LaFeAsO0.89F0.11 at high magnetic fields, up to 45 T, that show a remarkable enhancement of the upper critical field Bc2 compared to values expected from the slopes dBc2/dT ≈ 2 T K-1 near Tc, particularly at low temperatures where the deduced Bc2(0) ≈ 63–65 T exceeds the paramagnetic limit. We argue that oxypnictides represent a new class of high-field superconductors with Bc2 values surpassing those of Nb3Sn, MgB2 and the Chevrel phases, and perhaps exceeding the 100 T magnetic field benchmark of the high-Tc copper oxides."

https://openalex.org/W1983915780,"Quantum criticality is the intriguing possibility offered by the laws of quantum mechanics when the wave function of a many-particle physical system is forced to evolve continuously between two distinct, competing ground states. This phenomenon, often related to a zero-temperature magnetic phase transition, is believed to govern many of the fascinating properties of strongly correlated systems such as heavy-fermion compounds or high-temperature superconductors. In contrast to bulk materials with very complex electronic structures, artificial nanoscale devices could offer a new and simpler means of understanding quantum phase transitions. Here we demonstrate this possibility in a single-molecule quantum dot, where a gate voltage induces a crossing of two different types of electron spin state (singlet and triplet) at zero magnetic field. The quantum dot is operated in the Kondo regime, where the electron spin on the quantum dot is partially screened by metallic electrodes. This strong electronic coupling between the quantum dot and the metallic contacts provides the strong electron correlations necessary to observe quantum critical behaviour. The quantum magnetic phase transition between two different Kondo regimes is achieved by tuning gate voltages and is fundamentally different from previously observed Kondo transitions in semiconductor and nanotube quantum dots. Our work may offer new directions in terms of control and tunability for molecular spintronics."

https://openalex.org/W1986503994,"Adults with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer neurofibrillary degeneration in the brain, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we report that the presence of an extra copy of the dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) gene due to trisomy 21 resulted in overexpression of Dyrk1A and elevated kinase activity in DS brain. Dyrk1A phosphorylated tau at several sites, and these sites were hyperphosphorylated in adult DS brains. Phosphorylation of tau by Dyrk1A primed its further phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). Dyrk1A-induced tau phosphorylation inhibited tau's biological activity and promoted its self-aggregation. In Ts65Dn mouse brain, an extra copy of the Dyrk1A gene caused increased expression and activity of Dyrk1A and resulted in increased tau phosphorylation. These findings strongly suggest a novel mechanism by which the overexpression of Dyrk1A in DS brain causes neurofibrillary degeneration via hyperphosphorylating tau."
https://openalex.org/W2015417822,"Malaria parasites and related Apicomplexans are the causative agents of the some of the most serious infectious diseases of humans, companion animals, livestock and wildlife. These parasites must undergo sexual reproduction to transmit from vertebrate hosts to vectors, and their sex ratios are consistently female-biased. Sex allocation theory, a cornerstone of evolutionary biology, is remarkably successful at explaining female-biased sex ratios in multicellular taxa, but has proved controversial when applied to malaria parasites. Here we show that, as predicted by theory, sex ratio is an important fitness-determining trait and Plasmodium chabaudi parasites adjust their sex allocation in response to the presence of unrelated conspecifics. This suggests that P. chabaudi parasites use kin discrimination to evaluate the genetic diversity of their infections, and they adjust their behaviour in response to environmental cues. Malaria parasites provide a novel way to test evolutionary theory, and support the generality and power of a darwinian approach. Malaria parasites need to reproduce sexually before they can transmit to vectors, but despite extensive research on ways of blocking transmission, little is known about their reproductive strategies. Reece et al. use novel experiments to show that the assumptions of sex-allocation theory, previously controversial when used to explain sex ratios in malaria parasites, are in fact valid. As predicted by this plank of evolutionary theory, Plasmodium chabaudi parasites adjust their sex-allocation in response to the presence of unrelated conspecifics. By means of this kin discrimination they evaluate the genetic diversity of their infections, and adjust their behaviour in response to environmental cues. Malaria parasites must reproduce sexually to transmit to vectors, but very little is understood about their reproductive strategies. This paper details that malaria parasites adjust their sex ratios in response to unrelated conspecifics, as predicted by evolutionary theory."
https://openalex.org/W2037116004,"In humans, 1011 neutrophils are released from the bone marrow per day, and these cells have a half-life in the blood of only ~6.5 h. Although it is generally believed that neutrophils are cleared from the circulation via the liver and spleen, in this study using 111In-labeled senescent neutrophils, we show that in mice, 32% of neutrophils are cleared from the circulation via the bone marrow. We have previously shown that senescent neutrophils home to the bone marrow in a CXCR4-dependent manner, and we show here that pretreatment of neutrophils with pertussis toxin significantly inhibits neutrophil clearance via the bone marrow (75%), consistent with a role for chemokines in this process. By labeling senescent neutrophils with inert fluorescent microspheres, we have tracked their fate and shown that in vivo, they are ultimately phagocytosed by bone marrow stromal macrophages. Finally, we show that under noninflammatory conditions, circulating levels of neutrophils are regulated by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), but not interleukin-17. Interestingly, we report that the uptake of apoptotic neutrophils by bone marrow macrophages stimulates their production of G-CSF in vitro. Taken together, these data provide evidence that the bone marrow represents a major site of neutrophil clearance in mice.—Furze, R. C., Rankin, S. M.

https://openalex.org/W1981637853,"Since late 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks caused by infection with H5N1 virus has led to the deaths of millions of poultry and more than 10 thousands of wild birds, and as of 18-March 2008, at least 373 laboratory-confirmed human infections with 236 fatalities, have occurred. The unrestrained worldwide spread of this disease has caused great anxiety about the potential of another global pandemic. However, the effect of environmental factors influencing the spread of HPAI H5N1 virus is unclear.A database including incident dates and locations was developed for 128 confirmed HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry and wild birds, as well as 21 human cases in mainland China during 2004-2006. These data, together with information on wild bird migration, poultry densities, and environmental variables (water bodies, wetlands, transportation routes, main cities, precipitation and elevation), were integrated into a Geographical Information System (GIS). A case-control design was used to identify the environmental factors associated with the incidence of the disease. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that minimal distance to the nearest national highway, annual precipitation and the interaction between minimal distance to the nearest lake and wetland, were important predictive environmental variables for the risk of HPAI. A risk map was constructed based on these factors.Our study indicates that environmental factors contribute to the spread of the disease. The risk map can be used to target countermeasures to stop further spread of the HPAI H5N1 at its source."
https://openalex.org/W2114974417,"Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium contaminated vegetables and fruits are considerable sources of human infections. Bacteria present in raw plant-derived nutrients cause salmonellosis, the world wide most spread food poisoning. This facultative endopathogen enters and replicates in host cells and actively suppresses host immune responses. Although Salmonella survives on plants, the underlying bacterial infection mechanisms are only poorly understood. In this report we investigated the possibility to use Arabidopsis thaliana as a genetically tractable host system to study Salmonella-plant interactions. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) marked bacteria, we show here that Salmonella can infect various Arabidopsis tissues and proliferate in intracellular cellular compartments. Salmonella infection of Arabidopsis cells can occur via intact shoot or root tissues resulting in wilting, chlorosis and eventually death of the infected organs. Arabidopsis reacts to Salmonella by inducing the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades and enhanced expression of pathogenesis related (PR) genes. The induction of defense responses fails in plants that are compromised in ethylene or jasmonic acid signaling or in the MKK3-MPK6 MAPK pathway. These findings demonstrate that Arabidopsis represents a true host system for Salmonella, offering unique possibilities to study the interaction of this human pathogen with plants at the molecular level for developing novel drug targets and addressing current safety issues in human nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W2046214587,"Background Indolent forms of mastocytosis account for more than 90% of all cases, but the types and type and severity of symptoms and their impact on the quality of life have not been well studied. We therefore performed a case-control cohort study to examine self-reported disability and impact of symptoms on the quality of life in patients with mastocytosis. Methodology/Principal Findings In 2004, 363 mastocytosis patients and 90 controls in France were asked to rate to their overall disability (OPA score) and the severity of 38 individual symptoms. The latter was used to calculate a composite score (AFIRMM score). Of the 363 respondents, 262 were part of an ongoing pathophysiological study so that the following data were available: World Health Organization classification, standard measures of physical and psychological disability, existence of the D816V KIT mutation, and serum tryptase level. The mean OPA and AFIRMM scores and the standard measures of disability indicated that most mastocytosis patients suffer from disabilities due to the disease. Surprisingly, the patient's measurable and perceived disabilities did not differ according to disease classification or presence or absence of the D816V KIT mutation or an elevated (≥20 ng/mL) serum tryptase level. Also, 32 of the 38 AFIRMM symptoms were more common in patients than controls, but there were not substantial differences according to disease classification, presence of the D816V mutation, or the serum tryptase level. Conclusions On the basis of these results and for the purposes of treatment, we propose that mastocytosis be first classified as aggressive or indolent and that indolent mastocytosis then be categorized according to the severity of patients' perceived symptoms and their impact on the quality of life. In addition, it appears that mastocytosis patients suffer from more symptoms and greater disability than previously thought, that mastocytosis may therefore be under-diagnosed, and that the symptoms of the indolent forms of mastocytosis might be due more to systemic release of mediators than mast cell burden."
https://openalex.org/W2050179335,"The T lymphocyte plasma membrane condenses at the site of activation but the functional significance of this receptor-mediated membrane reorganization is not yet known. Here we demonstrate that membrane condensation at the T cell activation sites can be inhibited by incorporation of the oxysterol 7-ketocholesterol (7KC), which is known to prevent the formation of raft-like liquid-ordered domains in model membranes. We enriched T cells with 7KC, or cholesterol as control, to assess the importance of membrane condensation for T cell activation. Upon 7KC treatment, T cell antigen receptor (TCR) triggered calcium fluxes and early tyrosine phosphorylation events appear unaltered. However, signaling complexes form less efficiently on the cell surface, fewer phosphorylated signaling proteins are retained in the plasma membrane and actin restructuring at activation sites is impaired in 7KC-enriched cells resulting in compromised downstream activation responses. Our data emphasizes lipids as an important medium for the organization at T cell activation sites and strongly indicates that membrane condensation is an important element of the T cell activation process."
https://openalex.org/W2020792961,"Background Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock that causes severe economic loss in susceptible cloven-hoofed animals. Although the traditional inactivated vaccine has been proved effective, it may lead to a new outbreak of FMD because of either incomplete inactivation of FMDV or the escape of live virus from vaccine production workshop. Thus, it is urgent to develop a novel FMDV vaccine that is safer, more effective and more economical than traditional vaccines. Methodology and Principal Findings A recombinant silkworm baculovirus Bm-P12A3C which contained the intact P1-2A and 3C protease coding regions of FMDV Asia 1/HNK/CHA/05 was developed. Indirect immunofluorescence test and sandwich-ELISA were used to verify that Bm-P12A3C could express the target cassette. Expression products from silkworm were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle. Specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals. After challenge with virulent homologous virus, four of the five animals were completely protected, and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one. Furthermore, a PD50 (50% bovine protective dose) test was performed to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine. The result showed the subunit vaccine could achieve 6.34 PD50 per dose. Conclusion The results suggest that this strategy might be used to develop the new subunit FMDV vaccine."

In the fourth movement of our series on music, Laurel Trainor relates the emotional power of music to human biology. Rhythm and pitch derive directly from the structure of the ear and our basic mechanisms of encoding information. And neural constraints mean that certain sound patterns are easier to perceive than others, giving rise to some near-universal features of music.

https://openalex.org/W2130263229,"Background RRP is a devastating disease in which papillomas in the airway cause hoarseness and breathing difficulty. The disease is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) 6 or 11 and is very variable. Patients undergo multiple surgeries to maintain a patent airway and in order to communicate vocally. Several small studies have been published in which most have noted that HPV 11 is associated with a more aggressive course. Methodology/Principal Findings Papilloma biopsies were taken from patients undergoing surgical treatment of RRP and were subjected to HPV typing. 118 patients with juvenile-onset RRP with at least 1 year of clinical data and infected with a single HPV type were analyzed. HPV 11 was encountered in 40% of the patients. By our definition, most of the patients in the sample (81%) had run an aggressive course. The odds of a patient with HPV 11 running an aggressive course were 3.9 times higher than that of patients with HPV 6 (Fisher's exact p = 0.017). However, clinical course was more closely associated with age of the patient (at diagnosis and at the time of the current surgery) than with HPV type. Patients with HPV 11 were diagnosed at a younger age (2.4y) than were those with HPV 6 (3.4y) (p = 0.014). Both by multiple linear regression and by multiple logistic regression HPV type was only weakly associated with metrics of disease course when simultaneously accounting for age. Conclusions/Significance Abstract The course of RRP is variable and a quarter of the variability can be accounted for by the age of the patient. HPV 11 is more closely associated with a younger age at diagnosis than it is associated with an aggressive clinical course. These data suggest that there are factors other than HPV type and age of the patient that determine disease course."
https://openalex.org/W2109571718,"Exposure of adherent cells to DNA damaging agents, such as the bacterial cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) or ionizing radiations (IR), activates the small GTPase RhoA, which promotes the formation of actin stress fibers and delays cell death. The signalling intermediates that regulate RhoA activation and promote cell survival are unknown.We demonstrate that the nuclear RhoA-specific Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) Net1 becomes dephosphorylated at a critical inhibitory site in cells exposed to CDT or IR. Expression of a dominant negative Net1 or Net1 knock down by iRNA prevented RhoA activation, inhibited the formation of stress fibers, and enhanced cell death, indicating that Net1 activation is required for this RhoA-mediated responses to genotoxic stress. The Net1 and RhoA-dependent signals involved activation of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase p38 and its downstream target MAPK-activated protein kinase 2.Our data highlight the importance of Net1 in controlling RhoA and p38 MAPK mediated cell survival in cells exposed to DNA damaging agents and illustrate a molecular pathway whereby chronic exposure to a bacterial toxin may promote genomic instability."
https://openalex.org/W1967831157,"Ammonium transport proteins of the Mep/Amt/Rh family include microbial and plant Mep/Amt members, crucial for ammonium scavenging, and animal Rhesus factors likely involved in ammonium disposal. Recent structural information on two bacterial Mep/Amt proteins has revealed the presence, in the hydrophobic conducting pore, of a pair of preserved histidines proposed to play an important role in substrate conductance, by participating either in NH4+ deprotonation or in shaping the pore. Here we highlight the existence of two functional Mep/Amt subfamilies distinguishable according to whether the first of these histidines is conserved, as in yeast ScMep2, or replaced by glutamate, as in ScMep1. Replacement of the native histidine of ScMep2 with glutamate leads to conversion from ScMep2 to ScMep1-like properties. This includes a two-unit upshift of the optimal pH for transport and an increase of the transport rate, consistent with alleviation of an energy-limiting step. Similar effects are observed when the same substitution is introduced into the Escherichia coli AmtB protein. In contrast to ScMep1, ScMep2 is proposed to play an additional signaling role in the induction of filamentous growth, a dimorphic change often associated with virulence in pathogenic fungi. We show here that the histidine to glutamate substitution in ScMep2 leads to uncoupling of the transport and sensor functions, suggesting that a ScMep2-specific transport mechanism might be responsible for filamentation.

Considering Mep/Amt-type proteins, the Escherichia coli AmtB and Archaeglobus fulgidus Amt1 monomers comprise 11 transmembrane helices and are assembled into tightly packed trimers. In each monomer, below the proposed NH4+ site, the pore is sterically blocked by the side chains of two conserved phenylalanines (8Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y.

Although electrophysiological data have shown plant Mep/Amt-type proteins to perform electrogenic transport of ammonium (13Ludewig U. Von Wiren N. Frommer W.B. J. Biol.

Analysis of the EcAmtB crystal structures suggests that after a NH4+ deprotonation step, NH3 is the molecule conducted further by the protein, as the residues lining the pore are predominantly nonpolar, with the exception of two centrally located and highly conserved histidines (His168 and His318) (8Khademi S.

To date, however, the crystal data and the subsequent molecular dynamics simulations do not converge to a common mechanism for the proposed NH4+ deprotonation (16Lin Y. Cao Z. Mo Y. J. Am. Chem.

It remains to be uncovered whether NH4+ is deprotonated and, if so, whether this occurs before or after passage through the phenylalanine doors. Also unknown is whether the released proton moves out to the periplasm, or rather follows its own path into the cytoplasm as proposed by Andrade and co-workers (10Andrade S.L. Dickmanns A. Ficner R. Einsle O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14994-14999Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 22Andrade S.L. Einsle O. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 357-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). According to one view, the two centrally located conserved histidine residues are involved in NH4+ deprotonation before NH3 traverses the pore (8Khademi S. O'Connell J. II I Remis J. Robles-Colmenares Y. Miercke L.J. Stroud R.M. Science. 2004; 305: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These two histidines are arranged so that an unusual lateral hydrogen bond is formed between their two δ1 nitrogens. Recent in vivo data show that the twin-histidine structure is required for optimum substrate conductance in EcAmtB, His168 to glutamate being the sole tolerated, albeit transport activity reducing, substitution (23Javelle A. Lupo D. Zheng L. Li X.D. Winkler F.K. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39492-39498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Three Mep/Amt ammonium transport systems are found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, displaying different but somewhat overlapping kinetic properties (24Marini A.M. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Although ScMep2 is highly similar to ScMep1 and ScMep3 (about 40% identity), the two latter proteins share higher amino acid identity (79%) (25Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and likely emerged from the whole genome duplication event that occurred in the hemiascomycete branch (26Wolfe K.H. Shields D.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 708-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). Yeast Mep proteins are required for ammonium uptake (25Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) and ammonium leakage compensation (25Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell.

Microbiol. 2007; 64: 534-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and the ScMep2 glycoprotein is further proposed to act as a sensor in ammonium limitation-induced pseudohyphal growth (28Lorenz M.C. Heitman J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1236-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 29Marini A.M. Andre B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 552-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the first of the two crucial histidine residues in the conducting pore of EcAmtB is conserved in ScMep2 (His194), it is replaced by a glutamate in both ScMep1 (Glu181) and ScMep3 (Glu180). To better understand the potential biological significance of this divergence, we have analyzed the consequences of an H194E substitution in ScMep2 and of an E181H conversion in ScMep1. Our data suggest that there exist two functionally distinct subgroups of Mep/Amt-type proteins, likely having different transport mechanisms and distinct impacts on cell physiology and signaling.

To this medium, nitrogen sources were added as required by the experiment and as specified in the text. The nitrogen sources used were 0.1% glutamate, 0.1% proline, or (NH4)2SO4 at the specified concentrations.

The ScMep1 and ScMep2 proteins were probed with a rabbit antiserum (1:1,000) raised against the C-terminal region of the proteins (29Marini A.M. Andre B. Mol.

Primary antibodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG followed by measurement of chemiluminescence (Lumi-LightPLUS, Roche). Subcellular Fractionation—Fractionation was performed essentially as described previously (37Bagnat M. Chang A. Simons K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 4129-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). About 108 yeast cells were filtered (Millipore, 0.45 μm), washed with cold water, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of buffer L (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2.5 mm EDTA) containing proteinase inhibitors (Complete-Mini, Roche). An equal volume of glass beads was added and cells were lysed at 4 °C by vortex mixing for 10 min. The extracts were diluted with 500 μl of buffer L and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 × g to remove unbroken cells and large debris. The cleared lysate was centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 20 min in a SW55 Ti rotor (Beckman). The pellet (P20) was then resuspended in 20% glycerol in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol). The samples (500 μl) were loaded onto the top of a sucrose step gradient (0.5 ml, 53%; 1 ml, 43%, in buffer B) and centrifuged at 33,000 × g for 2 h in a SW55 Ti rotor (Beckman). After centrifugation, six fractions of equal volumes were collected from the top of the gradient, and the distribution of Pma1, Mep1, and Dpm1 was analyzed by Western blotting. [14C]Methylammonium Uptake Assays—Initial rates of [14C]methylammonium (Amersham Biosciences) uptake were measured as described for amino acids (38Grenson M. Mousset M. Wiame J.M. Bechet J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 127: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) with cells grown in minimal medium containing proline as the nitrogen source. Briefly, 5-ml samples of an exponentially growing culture corresponding to about 0.25 mg of protein/ml were put, without any change of the medium, into vessels containing the labeled methylammonium (0.5 mm) and preheated to 29 °C in a rotary water bath. One-milliliter samples were then removed at intervals and poured onto filters (Millipore, 0.45 μm) that were immediately washed 5 times with 2 ml of iced water before counting. To determine the optimal pH of [14C]methylammonium (0.5 mm) transport, cells were transferred to fresh proline medium buffered at the desired pH, 30 min before measuring the initial uptake rate. To measure the effect of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) on ScMep activities, proline-grown cells were preincubated with the protonophore (50 μm CCCP in ethanol), or an equivalent volume of the solvent as control, 5 min prior to measuring the uptake of [14C]methylammonium (0.5 mm) transport at pH 6.1. Photomicroscopy—Yeast colonies were photographed directly on Petri plates with a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope, and images were captured with a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera. The Conserved Histidine 194 Residue in the Conducting Pore of ScMep2 Can Be Efficiently Replaced by a Glutamate—The presence of multiple Mep/Amt-, as well as Rh-type, proteins is frequent in both unicellular and pluricellular organisms. Whether this reflects functional differences between members whithin each subfamily may not be evident. Interestingly, the pair of largely conserved histidine residues is not ubiquitous in fungal Mep/Amts, although it is crucial for the activity of EcAmtB (23Javelle A. Lupo D. Zheng L. Li X.D. Winkler F.K. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39492-39498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, we will call these positions His1 and His2. Our sequence analyses indicate that fungal Mep/Amts closer to the ScMep2 ammonium transport/sensor protein contain a histidine at position His1 (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1). To this class belong the Mep/Amt proteins so far shown to play a sensor role in morphogenesis such as the Mep2 protein of Candida albicans. On the contrary, Mep/Amts closer to ScMep1/ScMep3 have a glutamate at position His1, and none has been shown to induce filamentation to date. In most cases where a glutamate occupies position His1, another glutamate residue precedes the His2 histidine, as in ScMep1. When a histidine occupies position His1, the position preceding His2 is frequently occupied by a nonpolar residue (Ile, Leu, Val, and Ala, an isoleucine in ScMep2) or rarely by a threonine or a serine. To test whether the presence of different residues at His1 in ScMep1/3 and ScMep2 might have functional significance, we used site-directed mutagenesis to produce an H194E substitution in ScMep2 and an E181H replacement in ScMep1. Cells lacking all three MEP genes are unable to grow at pH 6.1 on ammonium supplied as sole nitrogen source at a concentration below 5 mm, whereas expression of any single MEP gene restores growth under these conditions (25Marini A.M. Soussi-Boudekou S. Vissers S. Andre B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4282-4293Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The ScMep2H194E protein was able to complement the growth defect of triple mepΔ cells, indicating that this altered protein has retained its transport function (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). Like most Mep/Amt proteins, all three S. cerevisiae Mep proteins can transport the radiolabeled ammonium analogue [14C]methylammonium. Methylammonium is not metabolized by yeast cells and inhibits growth at high concentrations. Yet this compound proves cytotoxic only when taken up via ScMep1 or ScMep3, probably because of their higher transport rates compared with ScMep2 (39Dubois E. Grenson M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 175: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). ScMep2H194E showed a markedly lower affinity for [14C]methylammonium than native ScMep2 but a more than tripled maximal transport rate (Table 2). Interestingly, the novel kinetic parameters associated with ScMep2H194E are closer to those of native ScMep1 (24Marini A.M. Vissers S. Urrestarazu A. Andre B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3456-3463Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In keeping with this, ScMep2H194E was shown to complement more efficiently than native ScMep2 the growth defect of triple mepΔ cells on low ammonium at pH 6.1 (Fig. 2 and data not shown). Furthermore, it acquired the ability to mediate methylammonium-induced intoxication of yeast cells, and thereby behaved similarly to native ScMep1.TABLE 2Kinetic parameters of Mep1, Mep2, EcAmtB, and their His-Glu variantsVmaxKmnmol/min/mg proteinmmYCp Mep140aValues from Ref. 24.2aValues from Ref. 24.YCp Mep1E181HNDbN.D., not determined.NDYCp Mep217.5cValues from Ref. 29.0.34cValues from Ref. 29.YCp Mep2H194E64.0 ± 1.73.46 ± 0.44p426 EcAmtB4.6 ± 0.30.24 ± 0.03p426 EcAmtBH168E10.4 ± 0.91.50 ± 0.28a Values from Ref. 24Marini A.M.

This protein instability has, however, no negative consequences on the transport rate because the complementation efficiency of ScMep2H194E is even improved compared with native ScMep2 (Fig. 2). Moreover, as ScMep2H194E underwent N-linked glycosylation, it appears to progress properly into the secretion path (Fig. 3a). These results show that a histidine at position 194 in ScMep2 is not strictly required for the transport function and can be efficiently replaced by a glutamate. Furthermore, histidine to glutamate substitution appears to ease the passage of ammonium through the pore because the Vmax is markedly increased despite the lesser abundance of the altered protein. A Histidine to Glutamate Substitution at Position 168 Improves the Transport Rate of EcAmtB Expressed in Yeast—As a control, we investigated the functional consequences of an H168E substitution on the EcAmtB transport system expressed in yeast. Native EcAmtB restored, although poorly, the growth defect of triple mepΔ cells on 3 mm ammonium at pH 6.1 (34Javelle A. Thomas G. Marini A.M. Kramer R. Merrick M. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). The EcAmtBH168E version retained its transport function, in keeping with the observation that the conserved histidine at position His1 is not indispensable for the transport function of EcAmtB (23Javelle A. Lupo D. Zheng L. Li X.D. Winkler F.K. Merrick M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39492-39498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Yet in contrast to the limited uptake activity observed for EcAmtBH168E in E. coli, the altered protein restored growth of the yeast triple mepΔ cells more efficiently than native EcAmtB, as observed for ScMep2H194E compared with ScMep2 (Fig. 2). Consistently with this observation, EcAmtBH168E displayed a nearly 2.5-fold higher Vmax for [14C]methylammonium than native EcAmtB, although its affinity proved to be lower (Table 2). Hence, the H168E substitution in EcAmtB and the H194E substitution in yeast ScMep2 have similar consequences, indicating that in both proteins a limiting step for transport has been alleviated. Histidine Cannot Replace the Function of Glutamate 181 in the Conducting Pore of ScMep1—In contrast to ScMep2H194E, the ScMep1E181H version proved unable to complement the growth defect of triple mepΔ cells, indicating that this altered protein has lost its transport function (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). ScMep1E181H did not display any [14C]methylammonium uptake activity (data not shown) and appeared to have lost its ability to mediate cell intoxication in the presence of high methylammonium concentrations (Fig. 2). ScMep1E181H was inactive even when overproduced from an episomal plasmid. On Western blots, the ScMep1E181H protein proved similar to ScMep1 in abundance and migration pattern (Fig. 3b). Subcellular fractionation showed that ScMep1E181H correctly reaches the plasma membrane, because it co-fractionates with the plasma membrane proton ATPase Pma1 (Fig. 4). Thus, loss of function of ScMep1E181H is not linked to instability or mislocalization of the protein and likely reflects loss of intrinsic uptake activity. Glutamate at His1 in ScMep1 appears to play a particular role. Although the ionization state of this glutamate residue is unknown, its replacement by aspartate, another acidic residue, also led to loss of transport function (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). The altered protein was less abundant than ScMep1 (Fig. 3b), suggesting that ScMep1E181D is less stable. Subcellular fractionation showed that at least part of the ScMep1E181D, about half of it, reached the plasma membrane, the remainder being associated with internal membranes (Fig. 4). Protein destabilization often occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum when the protein is misfolded. The E181D substitution might thus alter the structure of ScMep1 and also, possibly, that of the conducting pore, this resulting in a strongly functionally altered protein. Overproduction of ScMep1E181D led to an increased ability to mediate cell intoxication in the presence of high methylammonium (Fig. 2). Hence, in contrast to ScMep1E181H, the ScMep1E181D variant is partially active. When a glutamate occupies position His1, a second glutamate residue generally precedes the His2 histidine, instead of a nonpolar residue, like isoleucine in ScMep2. To better mimic the ScMep2 situation, we tested whether the activity of ScMep1E181H might be restored by adding an E329I mutation. The immunodetected ScMep1E181H,E329I protein was less abundant than ScMep1 (Fig. 3b). Although subcellular fractionation showed that it reaches the plasma membrane (Fig. 4), the ScMep1E181H,E329I protein was inactive, even when overproduced (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). Actually, the single E329I substitution in ScMep1 reduced the transport efficiency although ScMep1E329I was stable and reached the plasma membrane (Figs. 2 and 3b and data not shown). This protein displayed barely detectable methylammonium uptake activity compared with native ScMep1 (1.3 versus 9.0 nmol/min/mg of protein), but this activity rose to about half that of overexpressed native ScMep1 (16.0 versus 29.2 nmol/min/mg of protein) when ScMep1E329I was also overexpressed. Accordingly, ScMep1E329I overexpression led to better growth on low ammonium and to enhanced intoxication by methylammonium (Fig. 2 and suppl"

Sixteen additional isoforms of syt have been identified, but little is known concerning their biochemical or functional properties. Here, we assessed the abilities of fourteen syt isoforms to directly regulate SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF) attachment protein receptor)-catalyzed membrane fusion. One group of isoforms stimulated neuronal SNARE-mediated fusion in response to Ca(2+), while another set inhibited SNARE catalyzed fusion in both the absence and presence of Ca(2+). Biochemical analysis revealed a strong correlation between the ability of syt isoforms to bind 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (PS) and t-SNAREs in a Ca(2+)-promoted manner with their abilities to enhance fusion, further establishing PS and SNAREs as critical effectors for syt action. The ability of syt I to efficiently stimulate fusion was specific for certain SNARE pairs, suggesting that syts might contribute to the specificity of intracellular membrane fusion reactions. Finally, a subset of inhibitory syts down-regulated the ability of syt I to activate fusion, demonstrating that syt isoforms can modulate the function of each other."
https://openalex.org/W1963665150,"Background Recycled treated or untreated wastewater represents an important health challenge in developing countries due to potential water related microbiological exposure. Our aim was to assess water quality and health implications in a Mexico City periurban agricultural area. Methodology/Principal Findings A longitudinal study in the Xochimilco wetland area was conducted, and 42 sites were randomly selected from 211, including irrigation water canals and effluents of treatment plants. Sample collection took place during rainy and dry seasons (2000–2001). Microbiological parameters (total coliforms, fecal coliforms, streptococci/enterococci, and bacteria other than Vibrio grown on TCBS), Helicobacter pylori, and physicochemical parameters including trihalomethanes (THM) were determined. Fecal coliforms and fecal streptococci are appropriate indicators of human or animal fecal contamination. Fecal coliform counts surpass Mexican and World Health Organization irrigation water guidelines. Identified microorganisms associated with various pathologies in humans and domestic animals comprise Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Salmonella spp., Enterobacter spp., Enterococcus spp., and Pseudomonas spp; H. pylori was also present in the water. An environmental characteristic of the canal system showed high Total Organic Carbon content and relatively low dissolved oxygen concentration; residual chlorine as a disinfection control is not efficient, but THMs do not represent a problem. During the rainy season, temperature and conductivity were higher; in contrast, pH, dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and residual chlorine were lower. This is related with the continuous load of feces from human and animal sources, and to the aquatic systems, which vary seasonally and exhibit evidence of lower water quality in effluents from treatment plants. Conclusions/Significance There is a need for improvement of wastewater treatment systems, as well as more efficient monitoring, regulation, and enforcement procedures for wastewater disposal into bodies of water."
https://openalex.org/W2060523581,"Performance of externally paced rhythmic movements requires brain and behavioral integration of sensory stimuli with motor commands. The underlying brain mechanisms to elaborate beat-synchronized rhythm and polyrhythms that musicians readily perform may differ. Given known roles in perceiving time and repetitive movements, we hypothesized that basal ganglia and cerebellar structures would have greater activation for polyrhythms than for on-the-beat rhythms.Using functional MRI methods, we investigated brain networks for performing rhythmic movements paced by auditory cues. Musically trained participants performed rhythmic movements at 2 and 3 Hz either at a 1:1 on-the-beat or with a 3:2 or a 2:3 stimulus-movement structure. Due to their prior musical experience, participants performed the 3:2 or 2:3 rhythmic movements automatically. Both the isorhythmic 1:1 and the polyrhythmic 3:2 or 2:3 movements yielded the expected activation in contralateral primary motor cortex and related motor areas and ipsilateral cerebellum. Direct comparison of functional MRI signals obtained during 3:2 or 2:3 and on-the-beat rhythms indicated activation differences bilaterally in the supplementary motor area, ipsilaterally in the supramarginal gyrus and caudate-putamen and contralaterally in the cerebellum.The activated brain areas suggest the existence of an interconnected brain network specific for complex sensory-motor rhythmic integration that might have specificity for elaboration of musical abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2160363565,"In the cerebellum, Delphilin is expressed selectively in Purkinje cells (PCs) and is localized exclusively at parallel fiber (PF) synapses, where it interacts with glutamate receptor (GluR) δ2 that is essential for long-term depression (LTD), motor learning and cerebellar wiring. Delphilin ablation exerted little effect on the synaptic localization of GluRδ2. There were no detectable abnormalities in cerebellar histology, PC cytology and PC synapse formation in contrast to GluRδ2 mutant mice. However, LTD induction was facilitated at PF-PC synapses in Delphilin mutant mice. Intracellular Ca2+ required for the induction of LTD appeared to be reduced in the mutant mice, while Ca2+ influx through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and metabotropic GluR1-mediated slow synaptic response were similar between wild-type and mutant mice. We further showed that the gain-increase adaptation of the optokinetic response (OKR) was enhanced in the mutant mice. These findings are compatible with the idea that LTD induction at PF-PC synapses is a crucial rate-limiting step in OKR gain-increase adaptation, a simple form of motor learning. As exemplified in this study, enhancing synaptic plasticity at a specific synaptic site of a neural network is a useful approach to understanding the roles of multiple plasticity mechanisms at various cerebellar synapses in motor control and learning."
https://openalex.org/W2145693418,"Malaria transmission depends on infective stages in the mosquito salivary glands. Plasmodium sporozoites that mature in midgut oocysts must traverse the hemocoel and invade the mosquito salivary glands in a process thought to be mediated by parasite ligands. MAEBL, a homologue of the transmembrane EBP ligands essential in merozoite invasion, is expressed abundantly in midgut sporozoites. Alternative splicing generates different MAEBL isoforms and so it is unclear what form is functionally essential. To identify the MAEBL isoform required for P. falciparum (NF54) sporozoite invasion of salivary glands, we created knockout and allelic replacements each carrying CDS of a single MAEBL isoform. Only the transmembrane form of MAEBL is essential and is the first P. falciparum ligand validated as essential for invasion of Anopheles salivary glands. MAEBL is the first P. falciparum ligand experimentally determined to be essential for this important step in the life cycle where the vector becomes infectious for transmitting sporozoites to people. With an increasing emphasis on advancing vector-based transgenic methods for suppression of malaria, it is important that this type of study, using modern molecular genetic tools, is done with the agent of the human disease. Understanding what P. falciparum sporozoite ligands are critical for mosquito transmission will help validate targets for vector-based transmission-blocking strategies."

https://openalex.org/W2097850982,"We have shown previously that, in astrocytoma cells, synemin is present at the leading edge, an unusual localization for an intermediate filament (IF) protein. Here, we report that synemin down-regulation with specific small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) sharply decreased the migration of astrocytoma cells. The presence of synemin at the leading edge also correlated with a high migratory potential, as shown by comparing astrocytoma cells to carcinoma cells without synemin at the leading edge. Synemin-silenced astrocytoma cells were smaller and spread more slowly than controls. In addition, synemin silencing reduced proliferation without increasing apoptosis. The adhesion to substratum and distribution of vinculin in focal contacts of synemin-silenced astrocytoma cells were similar to those of controls. Synemin-silenced cells, however, exhibited a reduction in the amount of filamentous (F) -actin and of alpha-actinin, but not of vinculin, associated with F-actin. Altogether, these results demonstrate that synemin is important for the malignant behavior of astrocytoma cells and that it contributes to the high motility of these cells by modulating the dynamics of alpha-actinin and actin."
https://openalex.org/W1971761299,"Background Since its first detection, characterization of R. felis has been a matter of debate, mostly due to the contamination of an initial R. felis culture by R. typhi. However, the first stable culture of R. felis allowed its precise phenotypic and genotypic characterization, and demonstrated that this species belonged to the spotted fever group rickettsiae. Later, its genome sequence revealed the presence of two forms of the same plasmid, physically confirmed by biological data. In a recent article, Gillespie et al. (PLoS One. 2007;2(3):e266.) used a bioinformatic approach to refute the presence of the second plasmid form, and proposed the creation of a specific phylogenetic group for R. felis. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present report, we, and five independent international laboratories confirmed unambiguously by PCR the presence of two plasmid forms in R. felis strain URRWXCal2T, but observed that the plasmid content of this species, from none to 2 plasmid forms, may depend on the culture passage history of the studied strain. We also demonstrated that R. felis does not cultivate in Vero cells at 37°C but generates plaques at 30°C. Finally, using a phylogenetic study based on 667 concatenated core genes, we demonstrated the position of R. felis within the spotted fever group. Significance We demonstrated that R. felis, which unambiguously belongs to the spotted fever group rickettsiae, may contain up to two plasmid forms but this plasmid content is unstable."
https://openalex.org/W2087914496,"Background Epidemiological studies suggest that radiation exposure may be a potential risk factor for schizophrenia in adult humans. Here, we investigated whether adult irradiation in rats caused behavioral abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia. Methodology/Principal Findings A total dose of 15-Gy irradiation in six fractionations during 3 weeks was exposed to the forebrain including the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) with male rats in the prone position. Behavioral, immunohistochemical, and neurochemical studies were performed three months after fractionated ionizing irradiation. Three months after fractionated ionizing irradiation, the total numbers of BrdU-positive cells in both the SVZ and SGZ zones of irradiated rats were significantly lower than those of control (sham-irradiated) rats. Hyperactivity after administration of the dopaminergic agonist methamphetamine, but not the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist dizocilpine, was significantly enhanced in the irradiated rats although spontaneous locomotion in the irradiated rats was significantly lower than that of controls. Behavioral abnormalities including auditory sensory gating deficits, social interaction deficits, and working memory deficits were observed in the irradiated rats. Conclusion/Significance The present study suggests that irradiation in adulthood caused behavioral abnormalities relevant to schizophrenia, and that reduction of adult neurogenesis by irradiation may be associated with schizophrenia-like behaviors in rats."
https://openalex.org/W1972335606,"One of the processes that regulate intracellular levels of polyamines in mammalian cells is polyamine uptake. We have measured polyamine uptake in COS7 cells for putrescine, spermidine, and spermine, obtaining K(m) values of 4.5, 1.0, and 0.8 mum, respectively. Treatment of nonconfluent cells with cycloheximide stimulated polyamine uptake and prevented the inhibitory effect found in cells preloaded with polyamines, suggesting the existence of a feedback repression mechanism mediated by antizymes. Transient transfected cells with mutated antizyme forms of AZ1, AZ2, and AZ3, which do not require frameshifting, showed a total blockade of polyamine uptake. Transfection of COS7 cells with mouse or human AZIN2, a novel member of the antizyme inhibitor family, recently characterized by our group, markedly stimulated polyamine uptake and counteracted the action of any of the three antizymes in co-transfected cells. The stimulatory effect of AZIN2 on polyamine uptake was abrogated when the putative antizyme binding sequence, formed by residues 117-140 in AZIN2, was deleted. Real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of antizyme inhibitor transcripts revealed that in brain and testes AZIN2 is more expressed than AZIN1, especially in the testes where the relative expression was about 25-fold higher. Collectively, our results clearly indicate that AZIN2 affects polyamine homeostasis not only by increasing ornithine decarboxylase activity but also by stimulating polyamine uptake, through negating the inhibitory effect of the antizymes. This finding may have physiological relevance, mostly in testes where AZ3 and AZIN2 are mainly expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2045431811,"Five pivotal clinical trials (Intensive Insulin Therapy; Recombinant Human Activated Protein C [rhAPC]; Low-Tidal Volume; Low-Dose Steroid; Early Goal-Directed Therapy [EGDT]) demonstrated mortality reduction in patients with severe sepsis and expert guidelines have recommended them to clinical practice. Yet, the adoption of these therapies remains low among clinicians.We selected these five trials and asked: Question 1--What is the current probability that the new therapy is not better than the standard of care in my patient with severe sepsis? Question 2--What is the current probability of reducing the relative risk of death (RRR) of my patient with severe sepsis by meaningful clinical thresholds (RRR >15%; >20%; >25%)?Bayesian methodologies were applied to this study. Odds ratio (OR) was considered for Question 1, and RRR was used for Question 2. We constructed prior distributions (enthusiastic; mild, moderate, and severe skeptic) based on various effective sample sizes of other relevant clinical trials (unfavorable evidence). Posterior distributions were calculated by combining the prior distributions and the data from pivotal trials (favorable evidence).Answer 1--The analysis based on mild skeptic prior shows beneficial results with the Intensive Insulin, rhAPC, and Low-Tidal Volume trials, but not with the Low-Dose Steroid and EGDT trials. All trials' results become unacceptable by the analyses using moderate or severe skeptic priors. Answer 2--If we aim for a RRR>15%, the mild skeptic analysis shows that the current probability of reducing death by this clinical threshold is 88% for the Intensive Insulin, 62-65% for the Low-Tidal Volume, rhAPC, EGDT trials, and 17% for the Low-Dose Steroid trial. The moderate and severe skeptic analyses show no clinically meaningful reduction in the risk of death for all trials. If we aim for a RRR >20% or >25%, all probabilities of benefits become lower independent of the degree of skepticism.Our clinical threshold analysis offers a new bedside tool to be directly applied to the care of patients with severe sepsis. Our results demonstrate that the strength of evidence (statistical and clinical) is weak for all trials, particularly for the Low-Dose Steroid and EGDT trials. It is essential to replicate the results of each of these five clinical trials in confirmatory studies if we want to provide patient care based on scientifically sound evidence."
https://openalex.org/W1976896987,"Lack of protective antibodies and inefficient cytotoxic responses are characteristics of chronic hepatitis C infection. A defect in dendritic cell (DC) function has thus been suspected, but this remains a controversial issue.Here we show that monocyte-derived DC (MoDC) from chronically-infected patients can mature in response to TLR1/2, TLR2/6 or TLR3 ligands. In contrast, when stimulated with the TLR4 ligand LPS, MoDC from patients show a profound defect in inducing IFNgamma secretion by allogeneic T cells. This defect is not due to defective phenotypic maturation or to the presence of HCV-RNA in DC or monocytes but is correlated to reduced IL-12 secretion by DC. Restoration of DC ability to stimulate IFNgamma secretion can be obtained by blocking MEK activation in DC, indicating that MEK/ERK pathway is involved in the Th1 defect of MoDC. Monocytes from HCV patients present increased spontaneous secretion of cytokines and chemokines, especially MIP-1beta. Addition of MIP-1beta on healthy monocytes during differentiation results in DC that have Th1 defect characteristic of MoDC from HCV patients, suggesting that MIP-1beta secretion by HCV monocytes participates in the Th1 defect of DC.Our data indicate that monocytes from HCV patients are activated in vivo. This interferes with their differentiation into DC, leading to deficient TLR4 signaling in these cells that are enable to induce a Th1 response. This specific defect is linked to the activation of the MEK/ERK pathway."

To understand this process, we transfected Δ264 CFTR plasmid cDNA into COS7 cells, and we noted that protein expression from the truncation mutant is barely detectable when compared with wild type or ΔF508 CFTR. Δ264 CFTR protein expression increases dramatically when cells are treated with proteasome inhibitors. Cycloheximide experiments show that Δ264 CFTR is degraded faster than ΔF508 CFTR.

Because of this, ΔF508 CFTR cannot function at the plasma membrane. How WT and mutant CFTR are processed and trafficked to the plasma membrane has been studied extensively (4Amaral M.D. J. Mol.

Very little core-glycosylated CFTR can be detected in the cells, but significant amounts of both B and C bands of WT CFTR can be detected especially in transfected cells (3Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J.

A major limitation to the success of AAV gene therapy for CF is that the large size of the CFTR cDNA insert fills the packaging capacity of AAV viral particles precluding inclusion of a highly efficient promoter.

Beads were washed once with lysis buffer, followed with two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. The beads were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer (30 μl) containing β-mercaptoethanol, vortexed for 1 min, resolved by 4–10% SDS-PAGE, and detected using the respective primary antibodies as described below. Immunoblotting—Cells were harvested and processed as described previously (16Cheng J. Moyer B.D. Milewski M. Loffing J. Ikeda M. Mickle J.E. Cutting G.R. Li M. Stanton B.A. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3520-3529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40) and in complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet-insoluble material. The supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The chemiluminescence signal on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was directly captured by FujiFilm LAS-1000 plus system with a cooled CCD camera. Quantification was carried out within the linear range using the ImageGauge version 3.2 software (FujiFilm). CFTR was detected with monoclonal anti-human CFTR (C terminus) antibody (1:1500; R & D Systems, Inc.). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), used as a loading control, was detected with monoclonal GAPDH antibody (1:10,000; US Biological). Rabbit polyclonal VCP and HDAC6 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and used at final concentration of 2 μg/ml. Processing of Δ264 CFTR—When Δ264 CFTR cDNA was transfected into COS7 cells, Δ264 CFTR protein expression is barely detectable (Fig. 1). This could be the consequence of an inefficient promoter driving only small amounts of gene transcription or of enhanced protein degradation resulting in reduced steady state amounts of detectable protein. The former is unlikely because we utilized a powerful CBA promoter with a cytomegalovirus enhancer known to express mRNA in high levels in these cells (8Sirninger J. Muller C. Braag S. Tang Q. Yue H. Detrisac C. Ferkol T. Guggino W.B. Flotte T.R. Hum. Gene Ther. 2004; 15: 832-841PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate this, we transfected into COS7 cells the same amount of CBA-WT CFTR, CBA-ΔF508 CFTR, or CBA-Δ264 CFTR cDNA. In Western blot experiments, WT and ΔF508 CFTR proteins are detectable at very high levels, whereas Δ264 CFTR is barely detectable. The results verified that CBA is a powerful promoter and is not the cause of low amounts of detectable Δ264 CFTR protein in transfection experiments. To evaluate the degradation of Δ264 CFTR, we treated cells with the inhibitor, MG132, a nonspecific inhibitor of proteasomal degradation. Fig. 2 shows that in the absence of MG132 (lane 5), Δ264 CFTR is barely detectable under these exposure conditions. In sharp contrast, in the presence of MG132, large amounts of Δ264 CFTR can be detected. We have obtained the same results with the proteasomal inhibitors, lactacystin (data not shown) and PS341 (discussed later), confirming that the data were indeed the result of proteasome inhibition. To study this further, we compared Δ264 to ΔF508 CFTR protein levels in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 2A, in the absence of MG132, again Δ264 CFTR protein is barely detectable. In contrast, even though only half the amount of ΔF508 cDNA was transfected compared with that of Δ264 CFTR, ΔF508 CFTR detectable protein is much higher than the protein detected from Δ264 CFTR. Comparing the sensitivities of Δ264 and ΔF508 CFTR to MG132, Fig. 2B shows clearly that ΔF508 CFTR is not as sensitive to MG132 (compare lanes 4 with 2) as Δ264 CFTR (compare lanes 3 with 1). To evaluate how much is degraded by the lysosome, we utilized the inhibitor E64. As shown in Fig. 2C, the amounts of Δ264 CFTR protein detected is not significantly affected by lysosomal inhibition. Summary data are shown in Fig. 2D. To evaluate how fast Δ264 protein is degraded compared with ΔF508 and WT CFTR, we treated transfected cells with cycloheximide. As shown in Fig. 3A, WT CFTR protein is relatively stable following cycloheximide treatment. This is in sharp contrast to ΔF508 and Δ264 CFTR whose proteins are degraded much faster. Among the three forms shown in Fig. 3, A and B, Δ264 CFTR protein is degraded the fastest. Because Δ264 is more efficiently degraded compared with ΔF508 CFTR, we hypothesized that it would interact with key components involved in CFTR degradation. CFTR can be degraded either in the proteasome (17Gelman M.S. Kannegaard E.S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11709-11714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or sequestered and perhaps degraded in aggresomes (18Johnston J.A. Ward C.L. Kopito R.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1883-1898Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). To evaluate these two routes, we tested for possible interactions of Δ264 CFTR with VCP, a member of the protein complex involved in extraction of CFTR from the ER membrane and retrograde translocation of CFTR to the proteasome (19Goldstein R.F. Niraj A. Sanderson T.P. Wilson L.S. Rab A. Kim H. Bebok Z. Collawn J.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2007; 36: 706-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and with HDAC6, the ubiquitin interacting deacetylase that promotes the movement of CFTR to aggresomes (20Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Matthias P. Muller C.W. Khochbin S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As expected, both Δ264 and ΔF508 CFTR do indeed associate both with VCP and HDAC6 (Fig. 4). We also observed that even though steady state levels of Δ264 CFTR protein are hardly detectable by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation with anti-CFTR antibody (supplemental Fig. 1), we were still able to pull down both VCP and HDAC6 by immunoprecipitation. Pull down of both VCP and HDAC6 by Δ264 CFTR indicates that Δ264 CFTR uses a similar degradation pathway as reported earlier for ΔF508 and WT CFTR (20Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Matthias P. Muller C.W. Khochbin S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To evaluate this further, we utilized the HDAC6 inhibitor, tubacin (21Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4389-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Tubacin is a recently identified and highly specific small molecule inhibitor of HDAC6-mediated aggresome formation (21Haggarty S.J. Koeller K.M. Wong J.C. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4389-4394Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). We compared the effects of tubacin on both Δ264 and ΔF508 CFTR protein levels to those obtained with the more specific proteasome inhibitor, PS-341/Bortezomib (Fig. 5). As expected, the steady state amounts of Δ264 CFTR protein detected by Western blotting are again dramatically increased (∼60-fold) either by MG132 or PS-341, showing again that the amount of Δ264 CFTR protein is exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. Tubacin, on the other hand, has a very small effect on the amount of Δ264 CFTR protein (∼40-fold less than PS-341). The small effect of tubacin on the amounts of Δ264 CFTR protein demonstrates that the majority of this truncated CFTR protein is processed through proteasomal degradation.FIGURE 5Δ264 CFTR is degraded primarily by the proteasome. Cells were transfected either with Δ264 CFTR or ΔF508 CFTR and were treated either with MG132, tubacin alone, or MG132 plus tubacin at 10 μm for 16 h (A). B, cells transfected either with Δ264 CFTR or ΔF508 CFTR were treated either with MG132 or PS341. Δ264 CFTR or ΔF508 CFTR control bands (absence of inhibitors) were quantified and normalized to control = 1. The following fold increases were obtained for Δ264 CFTR with inhibitors: MG132 = 54 ± 22 (p < 0.001); PS341 = 62 ± 21 (p < 0.001); tubacin alone = 1.5 ± 0.08 (p < 0.001); tubacin plus MG132 = 59 ± 8 (p < 0.001). The following fold increases were obtained for ΔF508 CFTR. Band B: MG132 = 4 ± 0.04 (p < 0.001); PS341 = 2.7 ± 0.05 (p < 0.001); tubacin alone = 1.8 ± 0.3 (p < 0.005); tubacin plus MG132 = 5.4 ± 0.2 (p < 0.001). The following fold increases were obtained for ΔF508 CFTR. Band C: MG132 = 7 ± 2 (p < 0.001); PS341 = 2 ± 0.5 (p < 0.001); tubacin alone = 2 ± 0.5 (p < 0.01); tubacin plus MG132 = 11 ± 3 (p < 0.001). All fold increases were log-transformed and tested for significance and found to be significantly different from control. Note that the fold changes following inhibition of the proteasome either with MG132 or PS341 are much greater for Δ264 CFTR than for ΔF508 CFTR. Also note that there is a highly significant increase in band C of ΔF508 CFTR compared with control when cells are treated with MG132, PS341, or tubacin plus MG132. n = 3 for all experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Neither proteasome nor HDAC6 inhibition has large effects on the B band of ΔF508 CFTR suggesting that at the steady state a significant pool of the immature band of ΔF508 CFTR protein resides in the ER. In contrast, the most dramatic effect is on band C. When MG132 is applied alone, there is an ∼7-fold increase, and when both MG132 and tubacin are applied together, there is an 11-fold increase in the steady state levels of band C of ΔF508 CFTR detected by Western blot. This indicates that if both proteasomal degradation and aggresome formation pathways are inhibited, we rescue the ΔF508 CFTR targeted for degradation and at the same time favor the processing of ΔF508 to mature band C. Taken together, our data suggest that Δ264 CFTR is efficiently degraded by the proteasome as compared with ΔF508 CFTR and lacks the biosynthetic arrest in the ER. The mechanism of the efficient degradation of Δ264 CFTR involves interactions with key elements of the quality control mechanism of the cell such as VCP and HDAC6. Δ264 CFTR Increases Expression of WT CFTR—In our previous experiments, when we infected the lungs of Rhesus monkeys with AAV5 Δ264 CFTR virus, we expected to detect robust expression of Δ264 CFTR protein, instead, to our surprise we saw increased amounts of the monkey's endogenous WT CFTR protein (7Fischer A.C. Smith C.I. Cebotaru L. Zhang X. Askin F.B. Wright J. Guggino S.E. Adams R.J. Flotte T. Guggino W.B. Mol. Ther. 2007; 15: 756-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We tested this further in transfection and cotransfection experiments of WT and Δ264 CFTR cDNA into COS7 cells. When Δ264 CFTR cDNA is transfected alone, Δ264 CFTR protein is again barely detectable (Fig. 6A, 1st lane) compared with the transfection of WT CFTR cDNA alone (2nd and 4th lanes). Note the increase in mature band C protein when WT CFTR is cotransfected with Δ264 CFTR cDNA (Fig. 6A, 3rd and 5th lanes). One possibility is that the increase in detectable WT CFTR protein is caused simply by transfecting two genes into the cells. To eliminate this possibility, we cotransfected WT CFTR and Δ264 CFTR with CD4 cDNA, a non-CFTR membrane protein. Fig. 6A shows that CD4 cDNA cotransfection reduces both Δ264 CFTR (compare lane 1 to 2) and WT CFTR (lane 5) protein, and cotransfection with Δ264 CFTR cDNA increases the amount of WT CFTR protein detected. Fig. 6B shows the summary data where the total amount of cDNA transfected was kept constant at 8 μg. Note that when coexpressed with Δ264 CFTR, there is a significant increase in detectable C band of WT CFTR. The result shows that cotransfection of Δ264 cDNA significantly increases WT CFTR protein. The observation that cotransfection with CD4 cDNA produces a reduction in detectable protein for both WT and Δ264 CFTR is strong evidence that the enhanced effect of Δ264 on WT CFTR is not caused simply by transfecting two plasmids. However, to be sure that this is not the case, we transfected CFBE41o– cells that were stably transduced previously with WT CFTR cDNA. Fig. 7 clearly shows that WT CFTR protein is increased when Δ264 CFTR cDNA is transiently transfected into the cells. Thus, the conclusion from this work is that Δ264 CFTR does indeed enhance the processing of WT CFTR. Δ264 CFTR Rescues ΔF508 CFTR—To study whether Δ264 CFTR affects the maturation of ΔF508 CFTR, additional transfection and cotransfection experiments in COS7 cells were performed (Fig. 8, A and B). Mature C band from ΔF508 CFTR was significantly increased by 55% in cells cotransfected with ΔF508 CFTR and Δ264 CFTR versus cells transfected with ΔF508 CFTR cDNA alone (Fig. 8, A and B). Note that when cotransfected with ΔF508 CFTR cDNA, Δ264 CFTR protein is not detectable (Fig. 8A). Fig. 9 shows the results of experiments on CFBE41o-ΔF508. The CFBE41o-ΔF508 CFTR cells were previously stably transduced with a lentivirus containing ΔF508 CFTR cDNA (14Bebok Z. Collawn J.F. Wakefield J. Parker W. Li Y. Varga K. Sorscher E.J. Clancy J.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2005; 569: 601-615Crossref Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Fig. 9, lane 7, note that even though the cells were transduced prior to our experiments with a lentivirus containing ΔF508 CFTR, in the absence of Δ264 CFTR bands B and C of ΔF508 CFTRs are barely detectable in cells. When the cells were transiently transfected with an additional amount of ΔF508 CFTR cDNA (Fig. 9, lane 6), the primary effect is an increase in band B and a small increase in detectable band C protein. In contrast, when increasing amounts of Δ264 CFTR cDNA were transiently transfected into these cells (Fig. 9, lanes 1–5), the detectable band C protein originating from the stably expressed ΔF508 CFTR is increased to a much greater extent than band B. To check the difference in mass between C and B bands, we used two different glycosidases (data not shown). Peptide N-glycosidase F (N-glycanase), which completely removes core and complex glycosylation from CFTR, and endoglycosidase H, which removes only unprocessed core oligosaccharides, were used (22Farinha C.M. Penque D. Roxo-Rosa M. Lukacs G. Dormer R. McPherson M. Pereira M. Bot A.G. Jorna H. Willemsen R. Dejonge H. Heda G.D. Marino C.R. Fanen P. Hinzpeter A. Lipecka J. Fritsch J. Gentzsch M. Edelman A. Amaral M.D. J. Cyst. Fibros. 2004; 3: 73-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Endoglycosidase H was very effective in removing the B band. Peptide N-glycosidase F in our experiments reduces C band (data not shown). Δ264 CFTR Is Functional—A full structure of CFTR has yet to be solved, but homology modeling based upon the structural information for other ABC transporters such as SAV1866 (23Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) suggests that cytosolic loops 1 and 2 may interact with one or two of the nucleotide binding domains of CFTR (24Mendoza J.L. Thomas P.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2007; 39: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Because Δ264 CFTR is missing cytosolic loops 1 and 2 as well as the first four membrane-spanning domains, the question then can be raised about the protein conformation and functionality of Δ264 CFTR. Functional data are available from electrophysiological experiments in Xenopus oocytes expressing CFTR truncation mutants where membrane-spanning domains 1–4 were progressively removed (9Carroll T.P. Morales M.M. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Flotte T.R. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11941-11946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Functional Cl– channels with ion selectivity identical to wild type CFTR were generated by all of these mutants, including Δ264 CFTR. On the other hand, removing more than four membrane-spanning segments did not produce functional channels. Thus, despite missing these predicted domains and inter-domain interactions with nucleotide binding domains, these mutants are still capable of forming selective ion channels (9Carroll T.P. Morales M.M. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Flotte T.R. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11941-11946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We also observed in previous studies single channel activity similar to wild type CFTR when Δ264 CFTR cDNA was transfected into IB3-1 cells (8Sirninger J. Muller C. Braag S. Tang Q. Yue H. Detrisac C. Ferkol T. Guggino W.B. Flotte T.R. Hum. Gene Ther. 2004; 15: 832-841PubMed Google Scholar). IB3-1 are CF bronchial epithelial cells containing two mutant alleles of CFTR, ΔF508/W1282X. There are low levels of ΔF508 CFTR protein expression but no expression of W1282X protein (25Zeitlin P.L. Lu L. Rhim J. Cutting G. Stetten G. Kieffer K.A. Craig R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Based upon the experiments reported here, the channel activity noted in the IB3-1 cell experiments could have come either directly from Δ264 CFTR or from ΔF508 rescued through transcomplementation of the endogenous ΔF508 CFTR. It is difficult to ascribe the channel activity measured in the IB3-1 cells transfected with Δ264 CFTR cDNA to channels expressed from Δ264 CFTR protein. However, ΔF508 CFTR is well known to have a very low single channel activity when rescued to the cell surface (26Dalemans W. Barby P. Champigny G. Jallat S. Dott K. Dreyer D. Crystal R.G. Pavirani A. Lecocq J.-P. Lazdunski M. Nature. 1992; 354: 526-528Crossref Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In contrast, the single channel activity of Δ264 CFTR observed in Xenopus oocytes injected with Δ264 CFTR mRNA is closer to that of WT CFTR than to ΔF508-CFTR (9Carroll T.P. Morales M.M. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Flotte T.R. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11941-11946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, based upon these distinct differences in open probabilities of ΔF508 CFTR versus Δ264 CFTR, we surmise that the single channel recordings in the IB3-1 cells transfected with Δ264 CFTR cDNA are indeed from Δ264 CFTR channels at the cell surface or at least a combination of channel activity both from Δ264 and ΔF508 CFTR. In another functional assay, a model of airway inflammation in a CFTR knock-out mouse was created utilizing A. fumigatus crude protein extract (Af-cpe) to mimic allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Intratrachial infection of these mice with AAV5 Δ264 CFTR partially corrected aberrant cytokine signaling and ameliorated the allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in gut-corrected CFTR knock-out mice (11Mueller C. Torrez D. Braag S. Martino A. Clarke T. Campbell-Thompson M. Flotte T.R. J. Gene Med. 2008; 10: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, despite our observations that Δ264 CFTR is rapidly degraded, it has been shown in CF knock-out mice that Δ264 CFTR is capable of at least of partial correction of the induced inflammatory pathology. How Δ264 CFTR is functioning was not studied. But because these knock-out mice did not have ΔF508 CFTR, it is likely that the functional correction is indeed coming from Δ264 CFTR protein expression at the surface of the mice airway cells. Δ264 and ΔF508 CFTR Degradation—Our data show that when large amounts of Δ264 CFTR cDNA are transfected into cells, the mutant protein is barely detectable. This is in contrast to ΔF508 CFTR whose immature B band is readily detectable. It is known that newly synthesized core-glycosylated ΔF508 CFTR is produced at the same rate as core-glycosylated WT CFTR band B (27Du K. Sharma M. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This suggests that the quality control mechanism is not able to distinguish between WT and ΔF508 CFTR before the formation of band B. The impact of the ΔF508 CFTR mutation is to limit the conversion of immature band B into mature band C, the more complex-glycosylated form of CFTR. In contrast to ΔF508 CFTR, which in the steady state we show resides in the ER, Δ264 CFTR is recognized by the quality control mechanism and rapidly degraded. As shown by others, portions of transmembrane segments 1–4 do play a role in the stability of CFTR (28Lu Y. Xiong X. Helm A. Kimani K. Bragin A. Skach W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 568-576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the maturation of ΔF508 CFTR toward biosynthetic arrest in the ER is likely to involve the formation of a stable intermediate early in biosynthesis (27Du K. Sharma M. Lukacs G.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), a situation that does not occur for Δ264 CFTR. The relative stability of the immature band of ΔF508 CFTR compared with other more efficiently degraded forms of CFTR, such as Δ264 CFTR, makes it possible to develop CF therapeutics targeted specifically at continuing the processing of ΔF508 CFTR to the plasma membrane (4Amaral M.D. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2004; 23: 41-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data show that Δ264 CFTR is very sensitive to proteasome inhibitors. To understand this phenomenon, we showed that Δ264 is associated with VCP and HDAC6, both known to be involved in the ER-associated degradation of CFTR (20Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Matthias P. Muller C.W. Khochbin S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). p97/VCP and gp78 form complexes with polyubiquinated, misfolded proteins for translocation from the ER for proteasomal degradation. Interference in the VCP-CFTR complex leads to accumulation of immature ΔF508 CFTR in the ER and partial rescue of ΔF508 CFTR to the cell surface (29Vij N. Fang S. Zeitlin P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17369-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). HDAC6, on the other hand, is the microtubule-associated deacetylase, which by coupling with dynein motors translocates polyubiquitinated misfolded proteins to aggresomes (30Kawaguchi Y. Kovacs J.J. McLaurin A. Vance J.M. Ito A. Yao T.P. Cell. 2003; 115: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). HDAC6 is known to bind to polyubiquitinated CFTR (20Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Matthias P. Muller C.W. Khochbin S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). p97/VCP and HDAC6 work together in controlling polyubiquinated CFTR with p97/VCP enhancing chain turnover favoring proteasome degradation and HDAC6 inhibiting turnover to promote aggresome accumulation (20Boyault C. Gilquin B. Zhang Y. Rybin V. Garman E. Meyer-Klaucke W. Matthias P. Muller C.W. Khochbin S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3357-3366Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Both p97/VCP and HDAC6 associate with Δ264 CFTR and with ΔF508 CFTR suggesting that they share similar degradation pathways. Our data also indicate that the majority of the Δ264 CFTR is likely to process primarily through the proteasomal degradation pathway because proteasomal inhibition results in the appearance of much more detectable protein, whereas inhibiting HDAC6 with tubacin has little effect. Transcomplementation—Previous studies have reported transcomplementation of ΔF508 CFTR in cells transfected with only parts of CFTR (12Cormet-Boyaka E. Jablonsky M. Naren A.P. Jackson P.L. Muccio D.D. Kirk K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8221-8226Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These fragments are themselves extremely efficiently degraded and thereby improve the maturation of ΔF508 CFTR from B to C bands. We show here that Δ264 CFTR increases the amount of WT CFTR protein expression and causes maturation of immature band B to mature band Cof ΔF508 CFTR. How does Δ264 CFTR allow for the processing of mutant CFTR? Our data show that one way to increase processing of bands B to C of ΔF508 CFTR is to inhibit both proteasomal degradation and HDAC6 together. Perhaps by associating with both p97/VCP and HDAC6, Δ264 CFTR affects both proteasomal degradation and aggresomal accumulation of ΔF508 CFTR allowing for the processing of bands B to C. Consistent with this is that inhibition of 97/VCP is already known to rescue ΔF508 CFTR (29Vij N. Fang S. Zeitlin P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17369-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that by engaging the processes involved in extraction of ΔF508 CFTR from the ER membrane, necessary for proteasome degradation, Δ264 CFTR redirects a pool of ΔF508 CFTR toward maturation of the C band. It is possible that Δ264 CFTR also engages the quality control machinery prior to the proteasome and thus induces the maturation of the ER-localized form of ΔF508 CFTR. Alterations of components of early quality control, involved in recognition of misfolded protein, are known to rescue ΔF508 CFTR. One of the first CFTR binding partners to be identified and documented to affect CFTR processing was the molecular chaperone Hsp70 (31Yang Y. Janich S. Cohn J.A. Wilson J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). It was later demonstrated that Hsp70 disassociates from WT CFTR during its movement to the Golgi. In contrast, Hsp70 remains associated with ΔF508 CFTR in the ER suggesting that Hsp70 plays a role in blocking ΔF508 CFTR transport out of the ER (32Brooks D.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 441-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Several other early quality control proteins have more recently been added to the list. For example, the co-chaperone HspBP1 inhibits the C terminus of Hsp70-interacting protein (CHIP) to stimulate CFTR maturation (33Alberti S. Bohse K. Arndt V. Schmitz A. Hohfeld J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4003-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clearly possible that Δ264 CFTR engages other components of quality control involved in the recognition of misfolded proteins to allow for the continued processing of ΔF508 CFTR out of the ER. In summary, our data suggest that transcomplementation of ΔF508 CFTR by Δ264 CFTR most likely occurs because Δ264 CFTR interacts with proteins in the ER-associated degradation pathway. Our previous data show that Δ264 CFTR can function as an ion channel at the plasma membrane in Xenopus oocytes (9Carroll T.P. Morales M.M. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Flotte T.R. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B.

When rAAV-Δ264 CFTR is transfected into CF cells, Δ264 CFTR itself can function as a Cl– channel (9Carroll T.P. Morales M.M. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Flotte T.R. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

This dual effect makes the rAAV-Δ264 CFTR a highly promising CF gene therapy vector. We thank Dr. Stuart L. Schreiber (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for providing tubacin.

https://openalex.org/W2017529872,"Annexin A2 (AnxA2) is a Ca2+- and acidic phospholipid-binding protein involved in many cellular processes. It undergoes Ca2+-mediated membrane bridging at neutral pH and has been demonstrated to be involved in an H+-mediated mechanism leading to a novel AnxA2-membrane complex structure. We used fluorescence techniques to characterize this H+-dependent mechanism at the molecular level; in particular, the involvement of the AnxA2 N-terminal domain. This domain was labeled at Cys-8 either with acrylodan or pyrene-maleimide fluorescent probes. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence analysis for acrylodan and fluorescence quenching by doxyl-labeled phospholipids revealed direct interaction between the N-terminal domain and the membrane. The absence of pyrene excimer suggested that interactions between N termini are not involved in the H+-mediated mechanism. These findings differ from those previously observed for the Ca2+-mediated mechanism. Protein titration experiments showed that the protein concentration for half-maximal membrane aggregation was twice for Ca2+-mediated compared with H+-mediated aggregation, suggesting that AnxA2 was able to bridge membranes either as a dimer or as a monomer, respectively. An N-terminally deleted AnxA2 was 2–3 times less efficient than the wild-type protein for H+-mediated membrane aggregation. We propose a model of AnxA2-membrane assemblies, highlighting the different roles of the N-terminal domain in the H+- and Ca2+-mediated membrane bridging mechanisms.

Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). These proteins have two structural domains: a C-terminal core with a conserved structure and an N-terminal domain variable in sequence and length (3Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). The core domain is formed by four repeats (or eight for AnxA6) containing Ca2+ binding sites. Each repeat consists of five α-helices connected by short loops. The four repeats are organized into a slightly curved oblate shape with a convex face harboring the Ca2+ binding sites, allowing contact with membrane phospholipids. The variable N-terminal domain, facing the concave surface at the opposite side of the membrane bilayer, contains interaction sites for other protein partners. This domain harbors a number of post-translational modifications and regulates the membrane activity properties of the core domain. annexin 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene annexin A2 labeled with acrylodan on Cys-8 annexin A2 with the first 29 residues deleted large unilamellar vesicles maximum entropy method 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(n-doxyl)-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (n = 5, 7 or 12) S100A10 protein egg l-α-glycerophosphatidylcholine brain l-α-glycerophosphatidyl-l-serine N-(1-pyrene)maleimide. annexin 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene annexin A2 labeled with acrylodan on Cys-8 annexin A2 with the first 29 residues deleted large unilamellar vesicles maximum entropy method 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(n-doxyl)-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (n = 5, 7 or 12) S100A10 protein egg l-α-glycerophosphatidylcholine brain l-α-glycerophosphatidyl-l-serine N-(1-pyrene)maleimide. Anx proteins not only bind the surface of model and biological membranes but can also assemble into different structures on these surfaces. Some of these proteins including AnxA5 can assemble into lateral structures forming two-dimensional networks on the membrane surface (4Mosser G. Ravanat C. Freyssinet J.M. Brisson A. J. Mol.

Gallay J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 493: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of Anxs also plays an important role in the specific membrane aggregative properties. In particular, the N-terminal domain of AnxA1 and AnxA2 interacts strongly with proteins of the S100 family, resulting in a severalfold increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of membrane aggregation (17Ayala-Sanmartin J. Vincent M. Sopkova J. Gallay J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15179-15189Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that the N-terminal domain of monomeric AnxA2 was also involved in the Ca2+-dependent membrane bridging at neutral pH: we demonstrated interactions between the N-terminal domains of two adjacent AnxA2 molecules, which were not in direct contact with the membrane phospholipids (19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Zibouche M. Illien F. Vincent M. Gallay J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Besides this classical Ca2+-dependent mechanism, Anx proteins also bind both model and cellular membranes independently of calcium ions (20Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J.

Pikula S. Faseb J. 2001; 15: 1083-1085PubMed Google Scholar), but not for AnxA1 and A2. AnxA2 undergoes an H+-dependent conformational change of repeat III, very similar to that in the presence of Ca2+ at neutral pH, but the H+-mediated binding at the membrane surface did not involve further structural modification of the core domain (26Lambert O.

The monomeric AnxA2 started to form bridges in vitro in the absence of Ca2+ at pH 6 and attained the maximal bridging at pH 5.2. However, the organization of the membrane junctions at acidic pH differed from that at neutral pH (26Lambert O. Cavusoglu N. Gallay J. Vincent M. Rigaud J.L. Henry J.P. Ayala-Sanmartin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10872-10882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We investigated the molecular structure of these novel membrane junctions previously observed by cryo-electron microscopy (26Lambert O. Cavusoglu N. Gallay J. Vincent M. Rigaud J.L. Henry J.P.

In particular, we studied the dynamics of the N-terminal domain in the free soluble form of the protein at acidic pH in the absence of calcium and the conformational and environment changes of this domain that may occur during membrane bridging, using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence techniques. We specifically labeled the reactive cysteine Cys-8 in the N terminus by thiolreactive fluorescent markers (19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Zibouche M. Illien F. Vincent M. Gallay J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 31Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We used 6-acryloyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene (acrylodan), a polarity-sensitive probe (32Weber G. Farris F.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3075-3078Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 33Prendergast F.G. Meyer M. Carlson G.L. Iida S. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7541-7544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to detect environment and mobility changes of the N-terminal domain and the excimer-sensitive probe N-(1-pyrene)maleimide (pyrene-maleimide) (34Galla H.J. Hartmann W. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1980; 27: 199-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), to detect potential interactions between N termini that we previously showed for the Ca2+-dependent membrane-bridging mechanism at neutral pH (19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Zibouche M. Illien F. Vincent M. Gallay J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We propose a model, based on our findings, for the organization of AnxA2 in Ca2+- and H+-mediated membrane bridging. Chemicals—Acrylodan and N-(1-pyrene)maleimide were purchased from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Type III-B egg l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and brain l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (PS) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Dr. Claude Wolf (CHU Saint-Antoine, Paris) kindly provided 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl(n-doxyl)-sn-glycerophosphatidylcholine (n-doxyl PC) derivatives labeled with a doxyl group at positions n = 5, 7, and 12 of the sn2 chain. Protein Preparation and Labeling with Acrylodan and Pyrene Maleimide—AnxA2 produced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified as previously described (35Ayala-Sanmartin J. Gouache P. Henry J.P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15190-15198Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Protein purity was estimated as >95% by gel electrophoresis. The N-terminally deleted AnxA2 (ΔN-AnxA2) was prepared as described in Ref. 10Ayala-Sanmartin J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 72-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. The only reactive cysteine of AnxA2, Cys-8, was labeled with acrylodan or pyrene maleimide using the method of Johnsson et al. (31Johnsson N. Marriott G. Weber K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2435-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) previously described in Ref. 19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Zibouche M. Illien F. Vincent M. Gallay J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar. The efficiency of acrylodan labeling was 50% and that of pyrene-maleimide labeling was 83% (see Ref. 19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Zibouche M. Illien F. Vincent M. Gallay J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Labeled proteins were stored at -20 °C. Membrane aggregative properties did not appear to differ between labeled and unlabeled proteins. LUV Preparation and Aggregation—Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) (PC/PS: 75/25 weight ratio) were prepared by extrusion as previously described (36Lamaziere A. Burlina F. Wolf C. Chassaing G. Trugnan G. Ayala-Sanmartin J. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e201Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were mixed together in chloroform. The solvent was removed from the mixture under a stream of nitrogen. Residual solvent was removed under vacuum for 1 h. Lipids were then resuspended in buffer A (40 mm Hepes pH 7, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA) at a final concentration of 1 mg ml-1, by vortexing vigorously. The multilamellar liposomes were then extruded by passing the suspension 21 times through a polycarbonate membrane with 0.1-μm pores (Avestin). Free calcium concentration, expressed as pCa (-log [Ca2+]), was controlled by EGTA buffering. Vesicle aggregation was monitored in buffer A in the presence of calcium, or in buffer B (40 mm acetate pH 4, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA) for pH 4 experiments, by turbidimetry at 340 nm, as previously described (37Lamaziere A. Wolf C. Lambert O. Chassaing G. Trugnan G. Ayala-Sanmartin J. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Steady-state Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded with a Cary Eclipse spectrofluorimeter with a slit width of 10 nm and 5 nm for excitation and emission, respectively. Samples were contained in microcuvettes (120 μl). Time-resolved Fluorescence Measurements—Fluorescence intensity and anisotropy decays were obtained from the polarized Ivv(t) and Ivh(t) components measured by the time-correlated single-photon counting technique. A diode laser (LDH 405 from Picoquant, Berlin-Adlershof, Germany; maximal emission at 392 nm) operating at 10 MHz was used as an excitation source. A Hamamatsu fast photomultiplier (model R3235-01) was used for detection. Emission wavelength was selected with a Jobin-Yvon H10 monochromator (bandwidth 16 nm) and a Schott KV418 cut-off filter. Each experimental decay Ivv(t) and Ivh(t) was stored ona2K plug-in multichannel analyzer card (Ortec Trump-PCI 2k, Ametek France), using Maestro-32 software. Automatic data sampling was controlled by the microcomputer. The instrumental response function (FWHM ∼ 600 ps) was collected automatically by measuring the light scattering of a glycogen solution during 30 s at the excitation wavelength, alternating with the parallel and perpendicular components of polarized fluorescence decay, each over a total of 90 s. Samples were contained in microcuvettes (120 μl). Fluorescence intensity decay analyses were performed with maximum entropy method (MEM), using a multiexponential model, Σαi exp(-t/τi), as previously described (38Vincent M. Brochon J.C. Merola F. Jordi W. Gallay J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8752-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A classical anisotropy model, Σβi exp(-t/θi), in which any rotational correlation time (θ) is coupled with each lifetime (τ), was used to resolve polarized fluorescence decays (39Vincent M. Gallay J. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 20: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Calculations were carried out with a set of 150 or 100 independent variables (equally spaced on a logarithmic scale) for intensity and anisotropy, respectively. The programs, including the MEMSYS 5 subroutines (MEDC Ltd, Cambridge, UK), were written in double-precision FORTRAN 77. Fluorescence Quenching by Doxyl-PCs—Quenching by doxyl-PCs (distearoylphosphatidylcholine (PC) labeled with a doxyl group bound at C5, C7, and C12 on the sn2 acyl chain) was carried out with LUV prepared with 10, 20, or 30% molar fractions of labeled PC, 25% PS, and supplemented with unlabeled PC. The distance, Zcf, from the center of the bilayer can be estimated according to the expression in Equation 1, Zcf=1-π×C×lnF1F2-L2122L21+LC1(Eq. 1) where F1 and F2 are the fluorescence intensities of the fluorophore in the presence of the shallow and of the deeper quenchers, respectively; L21 is the vertical distance between the shallow and the deep quenchers; Lc1 is the distance between the shallow quencher and the center of the bilayer; and C is the concentration of the quenchers in molecules per unit area (40Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). The distance of the quenchers from the center of the bilayer was 12.15 Å for 5-doxyl PC and 5.85 Å for 12-doxyl PC (41Abrams F.S. London E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10826-10831Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Conformational Dynamics of the Acrylodan-labeled AnxA2 N-terminal Segment in Solution at pH 4—The steady-state fluorescence emission spectrum of annexin A2 labeled with acrylodan (AnxA2acryl) at pH 4 peaked at 515–520 nm, consistent with previously reported values at neutral pH. Thus, the environment of acrylodan bound to Cys-8 in the N-terminal segment remained highly polar in mild acidic conditions (Fig. 1). The fluorescence intensity decay was not monoexponential (Fig. 2A). MEM analysis of the data showed the presence of three lifetime populations (Fig. 2, B and C), probably attributable to the existence of three local conformers: we did not detect any sign of excited state reaction, such as fluorescence build-up at long emission wavelength (data not shown). The center value and amplitude of each lifetime peak are presented in Table 1. The lifetime values are similar to those measured at neutral pH, showing that mild acidification does not alter the interactions between acrylodan and its microenvironment. However, we observed an H+-induced redistribution of the long and the intermediate lifetime amplitudes, involving a significant increase of the amplitude average lifetime by ∼15%: thus, mild acidification seemed to induce a redistribution of local conformers.FIGURE 2Time-resolved fluorescence intensity decay and lifetime distribution of AnxA2acryl.

The experimental anisotropy decay curve decreased rapidly at first, and then more slowly (Fig. 3). Two time constants were calculated: a subnanosecond component and a much longer component (Table 2). The short decay time probably reflects the local, partially restricted motion of acrylodan around its linker. The semi-angle value of the wobbling-in-cone subnanosecond rotation ωmax was large. The longest rotational correlation time value probably corresponds to the Brownian rotational motion of the protein. This value is significantly smaller at pH 4 than at pH 7 (19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Zibouche M. Illien F. Vincent M. Gallay J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), consistent with the more compact state of the protein at mild acidic pH in solution (26Lambert O. Cavusoglu N. Gallay J.

The amplitude of the shift (45 nm) is significantly larger than that observed at pH 7 in the presence of calcium (30 nm) (19Ayala-Sanmartin J. Zibouche M. Illien F. Vincent M. Gallay J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 472-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggesting that the microenvironment of acrylodan is more apolar when the protein interacts with the membrane in mild acidic conditions than at neutral pH in the presence of calcium. The fluorescence intensity decay changed slightly upon membrane bridging (Fig. 2 and Table 1), indicating a local conformational change of the N-terminal segment during these processes. The AnxA2-induced membrane bridging caused a significant decrease of the local dynamics of the N-terminal segment compared with the protein in solution, as shown by fluorescence anisotropy decay (Fig. 3). MEM analysis computed two rotational correlation time populations (Table 2). A nanosecond rotational motion appeared, and the longest rotational correlation time value increased substantially. However, the initial anisotropy value At=0 was significantly lower than the intrinsic anisotropy value in vitrified media (42Gallay J. Vincent M. Li de la Sierra I.M. Munier-Lehmann H. Renouard M. Sakamoto H. Barzu O. Gilles A.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 821-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), thus subnanosecond rotation was probably present. The semi-angle of the acrylodan subnanosecond wobbling-in-cone rotation ωmax also decreased considerably (Table 2), confirming a much larger restriction of movement than that previously observed for the Ca2+-dependent membrane-bridging mechanism at neutral pH (19Ayala-Sanmartin J.

To determine the extent of AnxA2acryl-membrane interactions, quenching experiments were performed with LUV (PC/PS 75/25) containing n-doxyl PC at different mol fractions (10, 20, and 30) (40Chattopadhyay A. London E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 46London E. Feigenson G.W. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 1932-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The various n-doxyl PCs showed high levels of quenching efficiency (up to 80%), depending on their mol fractions (Fig. 4). These findings demonstrated that acrylodan bound to Cys-8 on the N-terminal segment of the protein interacted strongly with the membrane lipids. The distance of the acrylodan moiety from the center of the bilayer was estimated from the quenching efficiency values of the shallow 5-doxyl PC and that of the deeper 12-doxyl PC derivatives to be 10.7 Å.

https://openalex.org/W2100028839,"Background Fatty acids are indispensable constituents of mycolic acids that impart toughness & permeability barrier to the cell envelope of M. tuberculosis. Biotin is an essential co-factor for acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) the enzyme involved in the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, a committed precursor, needed for fatty acid synthesis. Biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) provides the co-factor for catalytic activity of ACC. Methodology/Principal Findings BPL/BirA (Biotin Protein Ligase), and its substrate, biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mt) were cloned and expressed in E. coli BL21. In contrast to EcBirA and PhBPL, the ∼29.5 kDa MtBPL exists as a monomer in native, biotin and bio-5′AMP liganded forms. This was confirmed by molecular weight profiling by gel filtration on Superdex S-200 and Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). Computational docking of biotin and bio-5′AMP to MtBPL show that adenylation alters the contact residues for biotin. MtBPL forms 11 H-bonds with biotin, relative to 35 with bio-5′AMP. Docking simulations also suggest that bio-5′AMP hydrogen bonds to the conserved ‘GRGRRG’ sequence but not biotin. The enzyme catalyzed transfer of biotin to BCCP was confirmed by incorporation of radioactive biotin and by Avidin blot. The Km for BCCP was ∼5.2 µM and ∼420 nM for biotin. MtBPL has low affinity (Kb = 1.06×10−6 M) for biotin relative to EcBirA but their Km are almost comparable suggesting that while the major function of MtBPL is biotinylation of BCCP, tight binding of biotin/bio-5′AMP by EcBirA is channeled for its repressor activity. Conclusions/Significance These studies thus open up avenues for understanding the unique features of MtBPL and the role it plays in biotin utilization in M. tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2172055586,"Regulatory T cells are central actors in the maintenance of tolerance of self-antigens or allergens and in the regulation of the intensity of the immune response during infections by pathogens. An understanding of the network of the interaction between regulatory T cells, antigen presenting cells and effector T cells is starting to emerge. Dynamical systems analysis can help to understand the dynamical properties of an interaction network and can shed light on the different tasks that can be accomplished by a network.We used a mathematical model to describe a interaction network of adaptive regulatory T cells, in which mature precursor T cells may differentiate into either adaptive regulatory T cells or effector T cells, depending on the activation state of the cell by which the antigen was presented. Using an equilibrium analysis of the mathematical model we show that, for some parameters, the network has two stable equilibrium states: one in which effector T cells are strongly regulated by regulatory T cells and another in which effector T cells are not regulated because the regulatory T cell population is vanishingly small. We then simulate different types of perturbations, such as the introduction of an antigen into a virgin system, and look at the state into which the system falls. We find that whether or not the interaction network switches from the regulated (tolerant) state to the unregulated state depends on the strength of the antigenic stimulus and the state from which the network has been perturbed.Our findings suggest that the interaction network studied in this paper plays an essential part in generating and maintaining tolerance against allergens and self-antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1990256077,"Whole genome studies have highlighted duplicated genes as important substrates for adaptive evolution. We have investigated adaptive evolution in this class of genes in the human parasite Trypanosoma brucei, as indicated by the ratio of non-synonymous (amino-acid changing) to synonymous (amino acid retaining) nucleotide substitution rates.We have identified duplicated genes that are most rapidly evolving in this important human parasite. This is the first attempt to investigate adaptive evolution in this species at the codon level. We identify 109 genes within 23 clusters of paralogous gene expansions to be subject to positive selection.Genes identified include surface antigens in both the mammalian and insect host life cycle stage suggesting that competitive interaction is not solely with the adaptive immune system of the mammalian host. Also surface transporters related to drug resistance and genes related to developmental progression are detected. We discuss how adaptive evolution of these genes may highlight lineage specific processes essential for parasite survival. We also discuss the implications of adaptive evolution of these targets for parasite biology and control."
https://openalex.org/W1966964333,"The dead-end (Dnd1) gene is essential for maintaining the viability of germ cells. Inactivation of Dnd1 results in sterility and testicular tumors. The Dnd1 encoded protein, DND1, is able to bind to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) to displace micro-RNA (miRNA) interaction with mRNA. Thus, one function of DND1 is to prevent miRNA mediated repression of mRNA. We report that DND1 interacts specifically with APOBEC3. APOBEC3 is a multi-functional protein. It inhibits retroviral replication. In addition, recent studies show that APOBEC3 interacts with cellular RNA-binding proteins and to mRNA to inhibit miRNA-mediated repression of mRNA.Here we show that DND1 specifically interacts with another cellular protein, APOBEC3. We present our data which shows that DND1 co-immunoprecipitates APOBEC3 from mammalian cells and also endogenous APOBEC3 from mouse gonads. Whether the two proteins interact directly remains to be elucidated. We show that both DND1 and APOBEC3 are expressed in germ cells and in the early gonads of mouse embryo. Expression of fluorescently-tagged DND1 and APOBEC3 indicate they localize to the cytoplasm and when DND1 and APOBEC3 are expressed together in cells, they sequester near peri-nuclear sites.The 3'-UTR of mRNAs generally encode multiple miRNA binding sites as well as binding sites for a variety of RNA binding proteins. In light of our findings of DND1-APOBEC3 interaction and taking into consideration reports that DND1 and APOBEC3 bind to mRNA to inhibit miRNA mediated repression, our studies implicate a possible role of DND1-APOBEC3 interaction in modulating miRNA-mediated mRNA repression. The interaction of DND1 and APOBEC3 could be one mechanism for maintaining viability of germ cells and for preventing germ cell tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2109728079,"Estrogen receptor-α (ER) transcription function is regulated in a ligand-dependent (e.g., estradiol, E2) or ligand-independent (e.g., growth factors) manner. Our laboratory seeks to understand these two modes of action. Using a cell line that contains a visible prolactin enhancer/promoter array (PRL-HeLa) regulated by ER, we analyzed ER response to E2 and EGF by quantifying image-based results. Data show differential recruitment of GFP-ER to the array, with the AF1 domain playing a vital role in EGF-mediated responsiveness. Temporal analyses of large-scale chromatin dynamics, and accumulation of array-localized reporter mRNA over 24 hours showed that the EGF response consists of a single pulse of reporter mRNA accumulation concomitant with transient increase in array decondensation. Estradiol induced a novel cyclical pattern of mRNA accumulation with a sustained increase in array decondensation. Collectively, our work shows that there is a stimuli-specific pattern of large-scale chromatin modification and transcript levels by ER."
https://openalex.org/W1971098996,"The advancement of the computational biology field hinges on progress in three fundamental directions--the development of new computational algorithms, the availability of informatics resource management infrastructures and the capability of tools to interoperate and synergize. There is an explosion in algorithms and tools for computational biology, which makes it difficult for biologists to find, compare and integrate such resources. We describe a new infrastructure, iTools, for managing the query, traversal and comparison of diverse computational biology resources. Specifically, iTools stores information about three types of resources--data, software tools and web-services. The iTools design, implementation and resource meta-data content reflect the broad research, computational, applied and scientific expertise available at the seven National Centers for Biomedical Computing. iTools provides a system for classification, categorization and integration of different computational biology resources across space-and-time scales, biomedical problems, computational infrastructures and mathematical foundations. A large number of resources are already iTools-accessible to the community and this infrastructure is rapidly growing. iTools includes human and machine interfaces to its resource meta-data repository. Investigators or computer programs may utilize these interfaces to search, compare, expand, revise and mine meta-data descriptions of existent computational biology resources. We propose two ways to browse and display the iTools dynamic collection of resources. The first one is based on an ontology of computational biology resources, and the second one is derived from hyperbolic projections of manifolds or complex structures onto planar discs. iTools is an open source project both in terms of the source code development as well as its meta-data content. iTools employs a decentralized, portable, scalable and lightweight framework for long-term resource management. We demonstrate several applications of iTools as a framework for integrated bioinformatics. iTools and the complete details about its specifications, usage and interfaces are available at the iTools web page http://iTools.ccb.ucla.edu."
https://openalex.org/W2047251501,"Despite the establishment of the important role of nitric oxide (NO) on apoptosis, a molecular- level understanding of the origin of its dichotomous pro- and anti-apoptotic effects has been elusive. We propose a new mathematical model for simulating the effects of nitric oxide (NO) on apoptosis. The new model integrates mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways with NO-related reactions, to gain insights into the regulatory effect of the reactive NO species N2O3, non-heme iron nitrosyl species (FeLnNO), and peroxynitrite (ONOO−). The biochemical pathways of apoptosis coupled with NO-related reactions are described by ordinary differential equations using mass-action kinetics. In the absence of NO, the model predicts either cell survival or apoptosis (a bistable behavior) with shifts in the onset time of apoptotic response depending on the strength of extracellular stimuli. Computations demonstrate that the relative concentrations of anti- and pro-apoptotic reactive NO species, and their interplay with glutathione, determine the net anti- or pro-apoptotic effects at long time points. Interestingly, transient effects on apoptosis are also observed in these simulations, the duration of which may reach up to hours, despite the eventual convergence to an anti-apoptotic state. Our computations point to the importance of precise timing of NO production and external stimulation in determining the eventual pro- or anti-apoptotic role of NO."
https://openalex.org/W2053526337,"An ongoing debate in the object recognition literature centers on whether the shape representations used in recognition are coded in an orientation-dependent or orientation-invariant manner. In this study, we asked whether the nature of the object representation (orientation-dependent vs orientation-invariant) depends on the information-processing stages tapped by the task.We employed a repetition priming paradigm in which briefly presented masked objects (primes) were followed by an upright target object which had to be named as rapidly as possible. The primes were presented for variable durations (ranging from 16 to 350 ms) and in various image-plane orientations (from 0 degrees to 180 degrees, in 30 degrees steps). Significant priming was obtained for prime durations above 70 ms, but not for prime durations of 16 ms and 47 ms, and did not vary as a function of prime orientation. In contrast, naming the same objects that served as primes resulted in orientation-dependent reaction time costs.These results suggest that initial processing of object identity is mediated by orientation-independent information and that orientation costs in performance arise when objects are consolidated in visual short-term memory in order to be reported."
https://openalex.org/W1989499489,"Magnetars are a special class of slowly rotating (period approximately 5-12 s) neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields (>10(14 )G)--at least an order of magnitude larger than those of the 'normal' radio pulsars. The potential evolutionary links and differences between these two types of object are still unknown; recent studies, however, have provided circumstantial evidence connecting magnetars with very massive progenitor stars. Here we report the discovery of an infrared elliptical ring or shell surrounding the magnetar SGR 1900+14. The appearance and energetics of the ring are difficult to interpret within the framework of the progenitor's stellar mass loss or the subsequent evolution of the supernova remnant. We suggest instead that a dust-free cavity was produced in the magnetar environment by the giant flare emitted by the source in August 1998. Considering the total energy released in the flare, the theoretical dust-destruction radius matches well with the observed dimensions of the ring. We conclude that SGR 1900+14 is unambiguously associated with a cluster of massive stars, thereby solidifying the link between magnetars and massive stars."
https://openalex.org/W2051039907,"Background Comparative genome analyses of parasites allow large scale investigation of selective pressures shaping their evolution. An acute limitation to such analysis of Plasmodium falciparum is that there is only very partial low-coverage genome sequence of the most closely related species, the chimpanzee parasite P. reichenowi. However, if orthologous genes have been under similar selective pressures throughout the Plasmodium genus then positive selection on the P. falciparum lineage might be predicted to some extent by analysis of other lineages. Principal Findings Here, three independent pairs of closely related species in different sub-generic clades (P. falciparum and P. reichenowi; P. vivax and P. knowlesi; P. yoelii and P. berghei) were compared for a set of 43 candidate ligand genes considered likely to be under positive directional selection and a set of 102 control genes for which there was no selective hypothesis. The ratios of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS) were significantly elevated in the candidate ligand genes compared to control genes in each of the three clades. However, the rank order correlation of dN/dS ratios for individual candidate genes was very low, less than the correlation for the control genes. Significance The inability to predict positive selection on a gene in one lineage by identifying elevated dN/dS ratios in the orthologue within another lineage needs to be noted, as it reflects that adaptive mutations are generally rare events that lead to fixation in individual lineages. Thus it is essential to complete the genome sequences of particular species of phylogenetic importance, such as P. reichenowi."
https://openalex.org/W1996407993,"Ancient human DNA has been treated cautiously ever since the problems related to this type of material were exposed in the early 1990s, but as sequential genetic data from ancient specimens have been key components in several evolutionary and ecological studies, interest in ancient human DNA is on the increase again. It is especially tempting to approach archaeological and anthropological questions through this type of material, but DNA from ancient human tissue is notoriously complicated to work with due to the risk of contamination with modern human DNA. Various ways of authenticating results based on ancient human DNA have been developed to circumvent the problems. One commonly used method is to predict what the contamination is expected to look like and then test whether the ancient human DNA fulfils this prediction. If it does, the results are rejected as contamination, while if it does not, they are often considered authentic. We show here that human contamination in ancient material may well deviate from local allele frequencies or the distributions to be found among the laboratory workers and archaeologists. We conclude that it is not reliable to authenticate ancient human DNA solely by showing that it is different from what would be expected from people who have handled the material."
