https://openalex.org/W2963123289,"Drawing on various notions from theoretical computer science, we present a novel numerical approach, motivated by the notion of algorithmic probability, to the problem of approximating the Kolmogorov-Chaitin complexity of short strings. The method is an alternative to the traditional lossless compression algorithms, which it may complement, the two being serviceable for different string lengths. We provide a thorough analysis for all binary strings of length and for most strings of length by running all Turing machines with 5 states and 2 symbols ( with reduction techniques) using the most standard formalism of Turing machines, used in for example the Busy Beaver problem. We address the question of stability and error estimation, the sensitivity of the continued application of the method for wider coverage and better accuracy, and provide statistical evidence suggesting robustness. As with compression algorithms, this work promises to deliver a range of applications, and to provide insight into the question of complexity calculation of finite (and short) strings. Additional material can be found at the Algorithmic Nature Group website at http://www.algorithmicnature.org. An Online Algorithmic Complexity Calculator implementing this technique and making the data available to the research community is accessible at http://www.complexitycalculator.com."
https://openalex.org/W1489501428,"Eukaryotic type II topoisomerases (Top2α and Top2β) are homodimeric enzymes; they are essential for altering DNA topology by the formation of normally transient double strand DNA cleavage. Anticancer drugs (etoposide, doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone) and also Top2 oxidation and DNA helical alterations cause potentially irreversible Top2·DNA cleavage complexes (Top2cc), leading to Top2-linked DNA breaks. Top2cc are the therapeutic mechanism for killing cancer cells. Yet Top2cc can also generate recombination, translocations, and apoptosis in normal cells. The Top2 protein-DNA covalent complexes are excised (in part) by tyrosyl-DNA-phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2/TTRAP/EAP2/VPg unlinkase). In this study, we show that irreversible Top2cc induced in suicidal substrates are not processed by TDP2 unless they first undergo proteolytic processing or denaturation. We also demonstrate that TDP2 is most efficient when the DNA attached to the tyrosyl is in a single-stranded configuration and that TDP2 can efficiently remove a tyrosine linked to a single misincorporated ribonucleotide or to polyribonucleotides, which expands the TDP2 catalytic profile with RNA substrates. The 1.6-Å resolution crystal structure of TDP2 bound to a substrate bearing a 5'-ribonucleotide defines a mechanism through which RNA can be accommodated in the TDP2 active site, albeit in a strained conformation."

Furthermore, recent studies indicate that LCN2 expression and secretion by glial cells are induced by inflammatory stimuli in the central nervous system. The present study was undertaken to examine the regulation of LCN2 expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and to determine the role of LCN2 in the disease process. LCN2 expression was found to be strongly increased in spinal cord and secondary lymphoid tissues after EAE induction. In spinal cords astrocytes and microglia were the major cell types expressing LCN2 and its receptor 24p3R, respectively, whereas in spleens, LCN2 and 24p3R were highly expressed in neutrophils and dendritic cells, respectively. Furthermore, disease severity, inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, glial activation, the expression of inflammatory mediators, and the proliferation of MOG-specific T cells were significantly attenuated in Lcn2-deficient mice as compared with wild-type animals. Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-specific T cells in culture exhibited an increased expression of Il17a, Ifng, Rorc, and Tbet after treatment with recombinant LCN2 protein. Moreover, LCN2-treated glial cells expressed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and MMP-9. Adoptive transfer and recombinant LCN2 protein injection experiments suggested that LCN2 expression in spinal cord and peripheral immune organs contributes to EAE development. Taken together, these results imply LCN2 is a critical mediator of autoimmune inflammation and disease development in EAE and suggest that LCN2 be regarded a potential therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis.

Other laboratories have reported that LCN2 expression increases in the CNS after systemic LPS injection (44Ip J.P. Noçon A.L. Hofer M.J. Lim S.L. Müller M. Campbell I.L. Lipocalin 2 in the central nervous system host response to systemic lipopolysaccharide administration.J.

Int. 2011; 59: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, LCN2 was up-regulated in astrocytes, neurons, and neutrophils after spinal cord injury, and Lcn2-deficient mice showed reduced leukocyte infiltration and levels of proinflammatory mediators, such as MCP-1, TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase, after spinal cord injury (46Rathore K.I. Berard J.L. Redensek A. Chierzi S. Lopez-Vales R. Santos M. Akira S. David S. Lipocalin 2 plays an immunomodulatory role and has detrimental effects after spinal cord injury.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13412-13419Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that LCN2 is likely to play an important role in CNS inflammation and related diseases. LCN2 is recognized by cell surface receptor 24p3R, a brain-type organic cation transporter (BOCT) (28Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. A cell-surface receptor for lipocalin 24p3 selectively mediates apoptosis and iron uptake.Cell. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The expression of 24p3R has been detected in glia and neurons in the CNS, and recent studies have shown that LCN2 regulates neuronal migration, morphology (47Lee S. Lee W.H. Lee M.S. Mori K. Suk K. Regulation by lipocalin-2 of neuronal cell death, migration, and morphology.J. Neurosci. Res. 2012; 90: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and excitability (48Mucha M. Skrzypiec A.E. Schiavon E. Attwood B.K. Kucerova E. Pawlak R. Lipocalin-2 controls neuronal excitability and anxiety by regulating dendritic spine formation and maturation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 18436-18441Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These previous reports suggest that LCN2 has pleiotropic roles in different aspects of CNS physiology and pathology. In particular, the reported associations between LCN2 and IL-17 and chemokine expression strongly suggest its involvement in EAE, MS, and other inflammatory diseases of the CNS. In this study we investigated the involvement of LCN2 in the pathogenesis of EAE. LCN2 expression was increased in spinal cord, lymph nodes, and spleen during EAE. Lcn2 deficiency significantly attenuated disease severity, inflammatory infiltration, demyelination, and the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Furthermore, recombinant LCN2 protein enhanced the activation of encephalitogenic T cells and CNS-resident glial cells, and adoptive transfer and LCN2 protein injection experiments showed that LCN2 expression in the CNS and peripheral lymphoid tissues is critically involved in the development of EAE. Wild-type (WT) and Lcn2 knock-out (KO) C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Samtaco (Osan, Korea) and Dr. Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Japan), respectively. Lcn2 KO mice were back-crossed for 8–10 generations in a C57BL/6 background to generate homozygous and heterozygous animals, as described previously (49Nairz M. Theurl I. Schroll A. Theurl M.

The absence of Lcn2 in Lcn2-deficient mice was confirmed by PCR of genomic DNA. Animals used in the present study were acquired and cared for in accordance with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” published by the National Institutes of Health. Mice (7–8 weeks) were immunized subcutaneously with 50 or 200 μg of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35–55; MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) (GLBiochem, Shanghai, China) in 100 μl of a solution containing 50% of complete Freund's adjuvant with 10 mg/ml heat-killed H37Ra strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Difco) into areas draining into axillary and inguinal lymph nodes. Pertussis toxin (List Biological Laboratories, Campbell, CA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; at 200 ng/mouse) was administered intraperitoneally on days of immunization and again 48 h later. Animals were weighed and examined for disease symptoms daily. Evaluation of disease severity and other experiments were carried out in a blinded fashion. Disease severity was scored using a scale 0–5 as follows: 0 = no symptom; 1 = limp tail; 2 = weakness and incomplete paralysis of one or two hind limbs; 3 = complete hind limb paralysis; 4 = forelimb weakness or paralysis; 5 = moribund state or death. Mice were anesthetized with diethyl ether, transcardially perfused with cold saline, and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in 0.1 m PBS. Lumbar spinal cords were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 days and then cryo-protected with 30% sucrose solution for 3 days. Three animals were used per experimental group. Fixed brains were embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek, Sakura Finetek, Japan) for frozen sections and then sectioned coronally at 20 μm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess inflammatory lesions. To detect LCN2 expression, demyelination, glial activation, and immune cell infiltration sections were incubated with goat anti-LCN2 antibody (1:500 dilution; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), fluoromyelin (1:300 dilution; Invitrogen), mouse anti-GFAP antibody (1:500 dilution; BD Bioscience), rabbit anti-Iba-1 antibody (1:500 dilution; WAKO Osaka, Japan), and rat anti-CD4 antibody (1:200 dilution; Serotec, Oxford, UK). Sections were visualized directly or incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse, rat, rabbit, or goat IgG antibody (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) or Cy3-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody (The Jackson Laboratory). Percentage of LCN2- or 24p3R-expressing cells was determined by quantification of fluorescence intensities using Image J software and co-localization plug-in. For the quantification of demyelination, images of the lumbar sections were obtained, and Image J software was used to outline the demyelination area and total white matter area. Pixel area for each sample was calculated, and the percentage of demyelination was determined by dividing the total white matter area by the total demyelinated area (three lumbar sections examined for each animal). Histological scores were evaluated using H&E-stained lumbar spinal cord sections and the following scale (51Jiang H.R. Al Rasebi Z. Mensah-Brown E. Shahin A. Xu D. Goodyear C.S. Fukada S.Y. Liu F.T.

Immunol. 2009; 182: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar): 0 = no infiltration; 1 = mild infiltration around pial vessels; 2 = single-cell infiltration within the CNS; 3 = infiltration with mild perivascular cuffing; 4 = very intense infiltration with perivascular cuffing. For double-immunofluorescence staining, sections were incubated with a mixture of rabbit anti-LCN2 antibody (R&D Systems) or anti-24p3R (Slc22A17) antibody (Sigma) and either mouse anti-GFAP antibody (BD Bioscience), rabbit anti-Iba-1 antibody (WAKO), mouse anti-NeuN antibody (1:500 dilution; Millipore, Billerica, MA), rat anti-CD4 antibody (1:200 dilution; Serotec), rat anti-CD45 antibody (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), rat anti-Ly6G (Gr-1) antibody (1:200 dilution; eBioscience, San Diego, CA), or hamster anti-CD11c antibody (1:200 dilution; eBioscience) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then incubated with secondary antibody, washed, cover-slipped with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and examined under a confocal microscope. GFAP and Iba-1 fluorescence intensities and numbers of CD4+ T cells were quantified using Image J software. Pictures were taken of three non-overlapping fields of view chosen at random for each experiment. For immunohistochemistry, sections were washed briefly and then incubated with 0.3% H2O2 in 0.1 m PBS for 30 min at room temperature to quench endogenous peroxidase activity, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100, and blocked with 1% BSA and 5% normal goat serum. After washing with PBS, the sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with rabbit polyclonal anti-LCN2 antibody (1:500 dilution; R&D Systems) and then incubated with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution; Vector Laboratories). Sections were then incubated with avidin-biotin complex reagents (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature followed by diaminobenzidine detection. The sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and allowed to air-dry overnight. Each section was captured using a CCD color video camera (Olympus D70) attached to a microscope (Olympus BX51) equipped with a 100× objective lens. Total RNA was extracted from cells or tissues using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription was conducted using Superscript II (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. PCR amplification was conducted using a DNA Engine Tetrad Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) at an annealing temperature of 55–60 °C for 20–30 cycles using specific primer sets. To analyze PCR products, 10 μl of each PCR product was electrophoresed on 1% agarose gel and detected under UV light. Gapdh was used as an internal control.

https://openalex.org/W2105083983,"Intra-arterial (IA) delivery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for acute ischemic stroke is attractive for clinical translation. However, studies using rat model of stroke have demonstrated that IA MSCs delivery can decrease middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow, which may limit its clinical translation. The goal of this study is to identify a dose of IA MSCs (maximum tolerated dose; MTD) that does not compromise MCA flow and evaluate its efficacy and optimal timing in a rat model of reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion (rMCAo). We sought to determine if there is a difference in efficacy of acute (1 h) versus sub-acute (24 h) IA MSCs treatment after rMCAo. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent rMCAo (90 min) and an hour later a single dose of MSCs (at de-escalating doses 1×106, 5×105, 2×105, 1×105 and 5×104) was given using IA route. MSCs were suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and PBS alone was used for control experiments. We measured the percent change in mean laser Doppler flow signal over the ipsilateral MCA in de-escalating doses groups to determine MTD. The results demonstrated that the lowering of IA MSC dose to 1×105 and below did not compromise MCA flow and hence an IA MSC dose of 1×105 considered as MTD. Subsequently, 1 h and 24 h after rMCAo, rats were treated with IA MSCs or PBS. The 24 h delivery of IA MSCs significantly improved neurodeficit score and reduced the mean infarct volume at one month as compared to control, but not the 1 h delivery. Overall, this study suggests that the IA delivery of MSCs can be performed safely and efficaciously at the MTD of 1×105 delivered at 24 hours in rodent model of stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2056721274,"The sodium -pumping NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Na+-NQR) is the main ion pump and the primary entry site for electrons into the respiratory chain of many different types of pathogenic bacteria. This enzymatic complex creates a transmembrane gradient of sodium that is used by the cell to sustain ionic homeostasis, nutrient transport, ATP synthesis, flagellum rotation and other essential processes. Comparative genomics data demonstrate that the nqr operon, which encodes all Na+-NQR subunits, is found in a large variety of bacterial lineages with different habitats and metabolic strategies. Here we studied the distribution, origin and evolution of this enzymatic complex. The molecular phylogenetic analyses and the organizations of the nqr operon indicate that Na+-NQR evolved within the Chlorobi/Bacteroidetes group, after the duplication and subsequent neofunctionalization of the operon that encodes the homolog RNF complex. Subsequently, the nqr operon dispersed through multiple horizontal transfer events to other bacterial lineages such as Chlamydiae, Planctomyces and α, β, γ and δ -proteobacteria. Considering the biochemical properties of the Na+-NQR complex and its physiological role in different bacteria, we propose a detailed scenario to explain the molecular mechanisms that gave rise to its novel redox- dependent sodium -pumping activity. Our model postulates that the evolution of the Na+-NQR complex involved a functional divergence from its RNF homolog, following the duplication of the rnf operon, the loss of the rnfB gene and the recruitment of the reductase subunit of an aromatic monooxygenase."
https://openalex.org/W1970718026,"Communities worldwide are increasingly affected by natural hazards such as floods, droughts, wildfires and storm-waves. However, the causes of these increases remain underexplored, often attributed to climate changes or changes in the patterns of human exposure. This paper aims to quantify the effect of climate change, as well as land cover change, on a suite of natural hazards. Changes to four natural hazards (floods, droughts, wildfires and storm-waves) were investigated through scenario-based models using land cover and climate change drivers as inputs. Findings showed that human-induced land cover changes are likely to increase natural hazards, in some cases quite substantially. Of the drivers explored, the uncontrolled spread of invasive alien trees was estimated to halve the monthly flows experienced during extremely dry periods, and also to double fire intensities. Changes to plantation forestry management shifted the 1∶100 year flood event to a 1∶80 year return period in the most extreme scenario. Severe 1∶100 year storm-waves were estimated to occur on an annual basis with only modest human-induced coastal hardening, predominantly from removal of coastal foredunes and infrastructure development. This study suggests that through appropriate land use management (e.g. clearing invasive alien trees, re-vegetating clear-felled forests, and restoring coastal foredunes), it would be possible to reduce the impacts of natural hazards to a large degree. It also highlights the value of intact and well-managed landscapes and their role in reducing the probabilities and impacts of extreme climate events."
https://openalex.org/W2094041610,"The endothelial cell spheroid assay provides a suitable in vitro model to study (lymph) angiogenesis and test pro- and anti-(lymph) angiogenic factors or drugs. Usually, the extent of cell invasion, observed through optical microscopy, is measured. The present study proposes the spatial distribution of migrated cells as a new descriptor of the (lymph) angiogenic response. The utility of this novel method rests with its capacity to locally characterise spheroid structure, allowing not only the investigation of single and collective cell invasion but also the evolution of the spheroid core itself. Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to 2D-projected spheroid images obtained by optical microscopy, as well as to 3D images acquired by confocal microscopy. To validate the proposed methodology, endothelial cell invasion was evaluated under different experimental conditions. The results were compared with widely used global parameters. The comparison shows that our method prevents local spheroid modifications from being overlooked and leading to the possible misinterpretation of results."
https://openalex.org/W2047962431,"Extensively managed pastures are of crucial importance in sustaining biodiversity both in local- and landscape-level. Thus, re-introduction of traditional grazing management is a crucial issue in grassland conservation actions worldwide. Traditional grazing with robust cattle breeds in low stocking rates is considered to be especially useful to mimic natural grazing regimes, but well documented case-studies are surprisingly rare on this topic. Our goal was to evaluate the effectiveness of traditional Hungarian Grey cattle grazing as a conservation action in a mosaic alkali landscape. We asked the following questions: (i) How does cattle grazing affect species composition and diversity of the grasslands? (ii) What are the effects of grazing on short-lived and perennial noxious species? (iii) Are there distinct effects of grazing in dry-, mesophilous- and wet grassland types? Vegetation of fenced and grazed plots in a 200-ha sized habitat complex (secondary dry grasslands and pristine mesophilous- and wet alkali grasslands) was sampled from 2006–2009 in East-Hungary. We found higher diversity scores in grazed plots compared to fenced ones in mesophilous- and wet grasslands. Higher cover of noxious species was typical in fenced plots compared to their grazed counterparts in the last year in every studied grassland type. We found an increasing effect of grazing from the dry- towards the wet grassland types. The year-to-year differences also followed similar pattern: the site-dependent effects were the lowest in the dry grassland and an increasing effect was detected along the moisture gradient. We found that extensive Hungarian Grey cattle grazing is an effective tool to suppress noxious species and to create a mosaic vegetation structure, which enables to maintain high species richness in the landscape. Hungarian Grey cattle can feed in open habitats along long moisture gradient, thus in highly mosaic landscapes this breed can be the most suitable livestock type."
https://openalex.org/W2016002923,"Progressive accumulation of the amyloid β protein in extracellular plaques is a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease. Amyloid β is generated during sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. In addition to the proteolytic processing by secretases, APP is also metabolized by lysosomal proteases. Here, we show that accumulation of intracellular sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) impairs the metabolism of APP. Cells lacking functional S1P-lyase, which degrades intracellular S1P, strongly accumulate full-length APP and its potentially amyloidogenic C-terminal fragments (CTFs) as compared with cells expressing the functional enzyme. By cell biological and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that intracellular inhibition of S1P-lyase impairs the degradation of APP and CTFs in lysosomal compartments and also decreases the activity of γ-secretase. Interestingly, the strong accumulation of APP and CTFs in S1P-lyase-deficient cells was reversed by selective mobilization of Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum or lysosomes. Intracellular accumulation of S1P also impairs maturation of cathepsin D and degradation of Lamp-2, indicating a general impairment of lysosomal activity. Together, these data demonstrate that S1P-lyase plays a critical role in the regulation of lysosomal activity and the metabolism of APP."

The aim of the study was to examine how each of these metalinguistic awareness skills would exert their influence on the success of reading in Chinese with age. The results showed that all three metalinguistic awareness skills significantly predicted reading success. It further revealed that orthographic awareness played a dominant role in the early stages of reading acquisition, and its influence decreased with age, while the opposite was true for the contribution of morphological awareness. The results were in stark contrast with studies in English, where phonological awareness is typically shown as the single most potent metalinguistic awareness factor in literacy acquisition. In order to account for the current data, a three-stage model of reading acquisition in Chinese is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2054716361,"Our laboratory has identified a number of small molecules that bind to G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) by competing for peptide binding to the Gβγ ""hot spot."" M119/Gallein were identified as inhibitors of Gβγ subunit signaling. Here we examine the activity of another molecule identified in this screen, 12155, which we show that in contrast to M119/Gallein had no effect on Gβγ-mediated phospholipase C or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) γ activation in vitro. Also in direct contrast to M119/Gallein, 12155 caused receptor-independent Ca(2+) release, and activated other downstream targets of Gβγ including extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt) in HL60 cells differentiated to neutrophils. We show that 12155 releases Gβγ in vitro from Gαi1β1γ2 heterotrimers by causing its dissociation from GαGDP without inducing nucleotide exchange in the Gα subunit. We used this novel probe to examine the hypothesis that Gβγ release is sufficient to direct chemotaxis of neutrophils in the absence of receptor or G protein α subunit activation. 12155 directed chemotaxis of HL60 cells and primary neutrophils in a transwell migration assay with responses similar to those seen for the natural chemotactic peptide n-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe. These data indicate that release of free Gβγ is sufficient to drive directional chemotaxis in a G protein-coupled receptor signaling-independent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2063908859,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) directs ribosome-nascent chain complexes (RNCs) displaying signal sequences to protein translocation channels in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes and endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes. It was initially proposed that SRP binds the signal sequence when it emerges from an RNC and that successful binding becomes impaired as translation extends the nascent chain, moving the signal sequence away from SRP on the ribosomal surface. Later studies drew this simple model into question, proposing that SRP binding is unaffected by nascent chain length. Here, we reinvestigate this issue using two novel and independent fluorescence resonance energy transfer assays. We show that the arrival and dissociation rates of SRP binding to RNCs vary according to nascent chain length, resulting in the highest affinity shortly after a functional signal sequence emerges from the ribosome. Moreover, we show that SRP binds RNCs in multiple and interconverting conformations, and that conversely, RNCs exist in two conformations distinguished by SRP interaction kinetics."
https://openalex.org/W2046003236,"Annexin A2 (AnxA2) was reported to be an extracellular endogenous inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) activity on cell-surface LDL receptor degradation. In this study, we investigated the effect of silencing the expression of AnxA2 and PCSK9 in HepG2 and Huh7 cells to better define the role of AnxA2 in PCSK9 regulation. AnxA2 knockdown in Huh7 cells significantly increased PCSK9 protein levels as opposed to AnxA2 knockdown in HepG2 cells. However, HepG2 cells overexpressing AnxA2 had lower levels of PCSK9 protein. Overall, our data revealed a plausible new role of AnxA2 in the reduction of PCSK9 protein levels via a translational mechanism. Moreover, the C-terminal Cys/His-rich domain of PCSK9 is crucial in the regulation of PCSK9 activity, and we demonstrated by far-Western blot assay that the M1 and M2 domains are necessary for the specific interaction of PCSK9's C-terminal Cys/His-rich domain and AnxA2. Finally, we produced and purified recombinant PCSK9 from humans and mice, which was characterized and used to perform 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate LDL cell-based assays on the stable knockdown HepG2 and Huh7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2075727146,"A cohort of genes was selected to characterize the adipogenic phenotype in primary cell cultures from three tissue sources. We compared the quantitative expression of biomarkers in culture relative to their expression in vivo because the mere presence or absence of expression is minimally informative. Although all biomarkers analyzed have biochemical functions in adipocytes, the expression of some of the biomarkers varied enormously in culture relative to their expression in the adult fat tissues in vivo, i.e. inguinal fat for white adipocytes and brite cells, interscapular brown adipose tissue for brown adipocytes, and ear mesenchymal stem cells for white adipocytes from adult mice. We propose that the pattern of expression in vitro does not reflect gene expression in the adult mouse; rather it is predominantly the expression pattern of adipose tissue of the developing mouse between birth and weaning. The variation in gene expression among fat depots in both human and rodent has been an extensively studied phenomenon, and as recently reviewed, it is related to subphenotypes associated with immune function, the inflammatory response, fat depot blood flow, and insulin sensitivity. We suggest that adipose tissue biology in the period from birth to weaning is not just a staging platform for the emergence of adult white fat but that it has properties to serve the unique needs of energy metabolism in the newborn. A case in point is the differentiation of brite cells that occurs during this period followed by their involution immediately following weaning."
https://openalex.org/W1965473200,"Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and has significant genetic predisposition. Mitochondria may have a role in MDD and so mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been suggested as a possible biomarker for this disease. We aimed to test whether the mtDNA copy number of peripheral blood leukocytes is related to MDD in young adults. Methods A case-control study was conducted with 210 MDD patients and 217 healthy controls (HC). The mtDNA copy number was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method. Depression severity was assessed by the Hamilton-17 Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17). Results We found no significant differences in mtDNA copy number between MDD patients and HC, though the power analysis showed that our sample size has enough power to detect the difference. There were also no significant correlations between mtDNA copy number and the clinical characteristics (such as age, age of onset, episodes, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score and Global Assessment of Function Scale (GAF) score) in MDD patients. Conclusion Our study suggests that leukocyte mtDNA copy number is unlikely to contribute to MDD, but it doesn’t mean that we can exclude the possibility of involvement of mitochondria in the disease. Further studies are required to elucidate whether mtDNA can be a biomarker of MDD."
https://openalex.org/W2045039781,"Tenascin-C is an adhesion modulatory matrix protein that is highly expressed in tumors; however, its biochemical activity involved in tumorigenesis is not fully understood. On the other hand, increasing evidence indicates the importance of integrin α5β1 in cancer development. We previously demonstrated that tenascin-C harbors a functional site that can be released as a proadhesive peptide such as TNIIIA2. Peptide TNIIIA2 is capable of inducing activation of β1-integrins including α5β1 via syndecan-4. In this study the proadhesive effect of TNIIIA2 was characterized by potentiated and sustained activation of integrin α5β1. Based on this effect, TNIIIA2 rendered nontransformed fibroblasts (NIH3T3) resistant to serum deprivation-elicited anoikis through activation of the Akt/Bcl-2 pathway. Moreover, TNIIIA2 hyperstimulated PDGF-dependent proliferation of NIH3T3 by activating integrin α5β1. Tenascin-C, a parental protein of TNIIIA2, also stimulated PDGF-dependent proliferation, which was blocked by a matrix metalloproteinase-2/9 inhibitor and an anti-TNIIIA2 function-blocking antibody, suggesting proteolytic exposure of the proadhesive effect of TNIIIA2. Mechanistic analyses revealed that TNIIIA2 induced a lateral association of PDGF receptor β with the molecular complex of activated integrin α5β1 and syndecan-4 in the membrane microdomains enriched with cholesterol/caveolin-1, resulting in prolonged activation of PDGF receptor β and the subsequent Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in a PDGF-dependent manner. Of note, TNIIIA2 induced continuous proliferation in NIH3T3 in an integrin α5β1-dependent manner even after they formed a confluent monolayer. Thus, it was proposed that tenascin-C might be involved in deregulated cell growth through potentiated and sustained activation of integrin α5β1 after exposure of the proadhesive effect of TNIIIA2."

https://openalex.org/W2170363169,"Introduction Graphic warnings (GWs) on cigarette packs are widely used internationally and perhaps will be in the US but their impact is not well understood. This study tested support for competing hypotheses in different subgroups of young adults defined by their history of cigarette smoking and individual difference variables (e.g., psychological reactance). One hypothesis predicted adaptive responding (GWs would lower smoking-related intentions) and another predicted defensive responding (GWs would raise smoking-related intentions). Methods Participants were an online sample of 1,169 Americans ages 18–24, who were randomly assigned either to view nine GWs designed by the FDA or to a no-label control. Both the intention to smoke in the future and the intention to quit smoking (among smokers) were assessed before and after message exposure. Results GWs lowered intention to smoke in the future among those with a moderate lifetime smoking history (between 1 and 100 cigarettes), and they increased intention to quit smoking among those with a heavy lifetime smoking history (more than 100 cigarettes). Both effects were limited to individuals who had smoked in some but not all of the prior 30 days (i.e., occasional smokers). No evidence of defensive “boomerang effects” on intention was observed in any subgroup. Conclusion Graphic warnings can reduce interest in smoking among occasional smokers, a finding that supports the adaptive-change hypothesis. GWs that target occasional smokers might be more effective at reducing cigarette smoking in young adults."

Using a combination of single-molecule techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), to study the structure of nucleated cell membranes, we found that (1) proteins at the ectoplasmic side of the cell membrane form a dense protein layer (4 nm) on top of a lipid bilayer; (2) proteins aggregate to form islands evenly dispersed at the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane with a height of about 10-12 nm; (3) cholesterol-enriched domains exist within the cell membrane; (4) carbohydrates stay in microdomains at the ectoplasmic side; and (5) exposed amino groups are asymmetrically distributed on both sides. Based on these observations, we proposed a Protein Layer-Lipid-Protein Island (PLLPI) model, to provide a better understanding of cell membrane structure, membrane trafficking and viral fusion mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2314476936,"The incidence of skeletal anomalies could be used as an indicator of the “quality” of rearing conditions as these anomalies are thought to result from the inability of homeostatic mechanisms to compensate for environmentally-induced stress and/or altered genetic factors. Identification of rearing conditions that lower the rate of anomalies can be an important step toward profitable aquaculture as malformed market-size fish have to be discarded, thus reducing fish farmers’ profits. In this study, the occurrence of skeletal anomalies in adult rainbow trout grown under intensive and organic conditions was monitored. As organic aquaculture animal production is in its early stages, organic broodstock is not available in sufficient quantities. Non-organic juveniles could, therefore, be used for on-growing purposes in organic aquaculture production cycle. Thus, the adult fish analysed in this study experienced intensive conditions during juvenile rearing. Significant differences in the pattern of anomalies were detected between organically and intensively-ongrown specimens, although the occurrence of severe, commercially important anomalies, affecting 2–12.5% of individuals, was comparable in the two systems. Thus, organic aquaculture needs to be improved in order to significantly reduce the incidence of severe anomalies in rainbow trout."
https://openalex.org/W61112106,"Mouse formylpeptide receptor 2 (Fpr2) is a homologue of the human G-protein coupled chemoattractant receptor FPR2, which interacts with pathogen and host-derived chemotactic agonists. Our previous studies revealed reduced allergic airway inflammation and immune responses in Fpr2-deficient (Fpr2−/−) mice in association with diminished dendritic cell (DC) recruitment into the airway and draining lymph nodes. These defects prompted us to investigate the potential changes in the differentiation and maturation of DCs caused by Fpr2 deficiency. Bone marrow monocytes from Fpr2−/− mouse mice incubated with GM-CSF and IL-4 in vitro showed normal expression of markers of immature DCs. However, upon stimulation with the TLR4 agonist LPS, Fpr2−/− mouse DCs failed to express normal levels of maturation markers with reduced production of IL-12 and diminished chemotaxis in response to the DC homing chemokine CCL21. Fpr2−/− DCs also failed to induce allogeneic T-cell proliferation in vitro, and their recruitment into the T-cell zones of the spleen was reduced after antigen immunization. The capacity of Fpr2 to sustain normal DC maturation was dependent on its interaction with an endogenous ligand CRAMP expressed by DCs, because neutralization of either Fpr2 or CRAMP inhibited DC maturation in response to LPS. We additionally observed that the presence of exogenous CRAMP in culture increased the sensitivity of WT mouse DCs to LPS stimulation. The importance of CRAMP for DC maturation was further demonstrated by the observations that DCs from CRAMP−/− mice expressed lower levels of costimulatory molecules and MHC II and exhibited poor chemotaxis in response to CCL21 after LPS stimulation. Our observations indicate a nonredundant role for Fpr2 and its agonist CRAMP in DC maturation in immune responses.

Fpr2−/− DCs also failed to induce allogeneic T-cell proliferation in vitro, and their recruitment into the T-cell zones of the spleen was reduced after antigen immunization. The capacity of Fpr2 to sustain normal DC maturation was dependent on its interaction with an endogenous ligand CRAMP expressed by DCs, because neutralization of either Fpr2 or CRAMP inhibited DC maturation in response to LPS. We additionally observed that the presence of exogenous CRAMP in culture increased the sensitivity of WT mouse DCs to LPS stimulation. The importance of CRAMP for DC maturation was further demonstrated by the observations that DCs from CRAMP−/− mice expressed lower levels of costimulatory molecules and MHC II and exhibited poor chemotaxis in response to CCL21 after LPS stimulation. Our observations indicate a nonredundant role for Fpr2 and its agonist CRAMP in DC maturation in immune responses."

Myricetin effectively accumulated on the AuNPs/en/MWCNTs/GCE and caused a pair of irreversible redox peaks at around 0.408 V and 0.191 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) in 0.1 mol L-1 phosphate buffer solution (pH 3.5) for oxidation and reduction reactions respectively. The heights of the redox peaks were significantly higher on AuNPs/en/MWNTs/GCE compare with MWCNTs/GC and there was no peak on bare GC. The electron-transfer reaction for myricetin on the surface of electrochemical sensor was controlled by adsorption. Some parameters including pH, accumulation potential, accumulation time and scan rate have been optimized. Under the optimum conditions, anodic peak current was proportional to myricetin concentration in the dynamic range of 5.0×10-8 to 4.0×10-5 mol L-1 with the detection limit of 1.2×10-8 mol L-1. The proposed method was successfully used for the determination of myricetin content in tea and fruit juices."
https://openalex.org/W2048975882,"In rodents, daily feeding schedules induce food anticipatory activity (FAA) rhythms with formal properties suggesting mediation by food-entrained circadian oscillators (FEOs). The search for the neuronal substrate of FEOs responsible for FAA is an active area of research, but studies spanning several decades have yet to identify unequivocally a brain region required for FAA. Variability of results across studies leads to questions about underlying biology versus methodology. Here we describe in C57BL/6 male mice the effects of varying the ‘dose’ of caloric restriction (0%, 60%, 80%, 110%) on the expression of FAA as measured by a video-based analysis system, and on the induction of c-Fos in brain regions that have been implicated in FAA. We determined that more severe caloric restriction (60%) leads to a faster onset of FAA with increased magnitude. Using the 60% caloric restriction, we found little evidence for unique signatures of neuronal activation in the brains of mice anticipating a daily mealtime compared to mice that were fasted acutely or fed ad-libitum–even in regions such as the dorsomedial and ventrolateral hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and cerebellum that have previously been implicated in FAA. These results underscore the importance of feeding schedule parameters in determining quantitative features of FAA in mice, and demonstrate dissociations between behavioral FAA and neural activity in brain areas thought to harbor FEOs or participate in their entrainment or output."

There are large variations in the quality of the marketed FLJ products. To find marker ingredients useful for quality control, a tandem technology integrating ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q/TOF), principal component analysis (PCA), heat map analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis coupled with a NF-κB luciferase reporter gene assay were used to identify the different ingredients from the green bud, white bud, flowering stage and leaf stages, as well as to screen the anti-inflammatory activity of FLJ compositions. As flowering progressed, the anti-inflammatory effects of FLJ gradually decreased; however, chlorogenic acid, swertiamarin and sweroside should be used to evaluate the quality of FLJ products."
https://openalex.org/W2325711973,"Metabolic intermediates, such as succinate and citrate, regulate important processes ranging from energy metabolism to fatty acid synthesis. Cytosolic concentrations of these metabolites are controlled, in part, by members of the SLC13 gene family. The molecular mechanism underlying Na(+)-coupled di- and tricarboxylate transport by this family is understood poorly. The human Na(+)/dicarboxylate cotransporter NaDC3 (SLC13A3) is found in various tissues, including the kidney, liver, and brain. In addition to citric acid cycle intermediates such as α-ketoglutarate and succinate, NaDC3 transports other compounds into cells, including N-acetyl aspartate, mercaptosuccinate, and glutathione, in keeping with its dual roles in cell nutrition and detoxification. In this study, we construct a homology structural model of NaDC3 on the basis of the structure of the Vibrio cholerae homolog vcINDY. Our computations are followed by experimental testing of the predicted NaDC3 structure and mode of interaction with various substrates. The results of this study show that the substrate and cation binding domains of NaDC3 are composed of residues in the opposing hairpin loops and unwound portions of adjacent helices. Furthermore, these results provide a possible explanation for the differential substrate specificity among dicarboxylate transporters that underpin their diverse biological roles in metabolism and detoxification. The structural model of NaDC3 provides a framework for understanding substrate selectivity and the Na(+)-coupled anion transport mechanism by the human SLC13 family and other key solute carrier transporters."
https://openalex.org/W2013344751,"The present study examined intergroup judgments made between four groups of non-meat eaters: health vegetarians; ethical vegetarians; health vegans, and ethical vegans. Consistent with hypotheses based on horizontal hostility and the need to maintain ingroup distinctiveness, ethical vegetarians gave unfavorable evaluations to health vegetarians relative to vegans, especially when the mainstream omnivore group was made salient. Contrary to expectations, vegans gave relatively more favorable evaluations to ethical vegetarians than health vegetarians when mainstream salience was low. This was especially true for vegans who were motivated primarily by ethical concerns. When mainstream salience was high, vegans did not distinguish between the vegetarian subgroups. Results suggest that one’s motives for abstaining from meat often play a larger role in this type of intergroup perceptions than one’s dietary practices."
https://openalex.org/W1975536684,"The evolution of the influenza A virus to increase its host range is a major concern worldwide. Molecular mechanisms of increasing host range are largely unknown. Influenza surface proteins play determining roles in reorganization of host-sialic acid receptors and host range. In an attempt to uncover the physic-chemical attributes which govern HA subtyping, we performed a large scale functional analysis of over 7000 sequences of 16 different HA subtypes. Large number (896) of physic-chemical protein characteristics were calculated for each HA sequence. Then, 10 different attribute weighting algorithms were used to find the key characteristics distinguishing HA subtypes. Furthermore, to discover machine leaning models which can predict HA subtypes, various Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayes, and Neural Network models were trained on calculated protein characteristics dataset as well as 10 trimmed datasets generated by attribute weighting algorithms. The prediction accuracies of the machine learning methods were evaluated by 10-fold cross validation. The results highlighted the frequency of Gln (selected by 80% of attribute weighting algorithms), percentage/frequency of Tyr, percentage of Cys, and frequencies of Try and Glu (selected by 70% of attribute weighting algorithms) as the key features that are associated with HA subtyping. Random Forest tree induction algorithm and RBF kernel function of SVM (scaled by grid search) showed high accuracy of 98% in clustering and predicting HA subtypes based on protein attributes. Decision tree models were successful in monitoring the short mutation/reassortment paths by which influenza virus can gain the key protein structure of another HA subtype and increase its host range in a short period of time with less energy consumption. Extracting and mining a large number of amino acid attributes of HA subtypes of influenza A virus through supervised algorithms represent a new avenue for understanding and predicting possible future structure of influenza pandemics."
https://openalex.org/W2034684827,"The formation and attachment of new cementum is crucial for periodontium regeneration. Tissue engineering is currently explored to achieve complete, reliable and reproducible regeneration of the periodontium. The capacity of multipotency and self-renewal makes adipose tissue-deprived stem cells (ADSCs) an excellent cell source for tissue regeneration and repair. After rat ADSCs were cultured in dental follicle cell-conditioned medium (DFC-CM) supplemented with DKK-1, an inhibitor of the Wnt pathway, followed by 7 days of induction, they exhibited several phenotypic characteristics of cementoblast lineages, as indicated by upregulated expression levels of CAP, ALP, BSP and OPN mRNA, and accelerated expression of BSP and CAP proteins. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway controls differentiation of stem cells by regulating the expression of target genes. Cementoblasts share phenotypical features with osteoblasts. In this study, we demonstrated that culturing ADSCs in DFC-CM supplemented with DKK-1 results in inhibition of β-catenin nuclear translocation and down-regulates TCF-4 and LEF-1 mRNA expression levels. We also found that DKK-1 could promote cementogenic differentiation of ADSCs, which was evident by the up-regulation of CAP, ALP, BSP and OPN gene expressions. On the other hand, culturing ADSCs in DFC-CM supplemented with 100 ng/mL Wnt3a, which activates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, abrogated this effect. Taken together, our study indicates that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays an important role in regulating cementogenic differentiation of ADSCs cultured in DFC-CM. These results raise the possibility of using ADSCs for periodontal regeneration by modifying the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2065845730,"Background This study was aimed to examine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), and the association between MS and its components with CKD in Korea. Methods We excluded diabetes to appreciate the real impact of MS and performed a cross-sectional study using the general health screening data of 10,253,085 (48.86±13.83 years, men 56.18%) participants (age, ≥20 years) from the Korean National Health Screening 2011. CKD was defined as dipstick proteinuria ≥1 or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Results The prevalence of CKD was 6.15% (men, 5.37%; women, 7.15%). Further, 22.25% study population had MS (abdominal obesity, 27.98%; hypertriglyceridemia, 30.09%; low high-density cholesterol levels, 19.74%; high blood pressure, 43.45%; and high fasting glucose levels, 30.44%). Multivariate-adjusted analysis indicated that proteinuria risk increased in participants with MS (odds ratio [OR] 1.884, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.867–1.902, P<0.001). The presence of MS was associated with eGFR<60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (OR 1.364, 95% CI 1.355–1.373, P<0.001). MS individual components were also associated with an increased CKD risk. The strength of association between MS and the development of CKD increase as the number of components increased from 1 to 5. In sub-analysis by men and women, MS and its each components were a significant determinant for CKD. Conclusions MS and its individual components can predict the risk of prevalent CKD for men and women."
https://openalex.org/W2130377197,"The alanine, serine, cysteine transporters (ASCTs) belong to the solute carrier family 1A (SLC1A), which also includes the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) and the prokaryotic aspartate transporter GltPh. Acidic amino acid transport by the EAATs is coupled to the co-transport of three Na(+) ions and one proton, and the counter-transport of one K(+) ion. In contrast, neutral amino acid exchange by the ASCTs does not require protons or the counter-transport of K(+) ions and the number of Na(+) ions required is not well established. One property common to SLC1A family members is a substrate-activated anion conductance. We have investigated the number and location of Na(+) ions required by ASCT1 by mutating residues in ASCT1 that correspond to residues in the EAATs and GltPh that are involved in Na(+) binding. Mutations to all three proposed Na(+) sites influence the binding of substrate and/or Na(+), or the rate of substrate exchange. A G422S mutation near the Na2 site reduced Na(+) affinity, without affecting the rate of exchange. D467T and D467A mutations in the Na1 site reduce Na(+) and substrate affinity and also the rate of substrate exchange. T124A and D380A mutations in the Na3 site selectively reduce the affinity for Na(+) and the rate of substrate exchange without affecting substrate affinity. In many of the mutants that reduce the rate of substrate transport the amplitudes of the substrate-activated anion conductances are not substantially affected indicating altered ion dependence for channel activation compared with substrate exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2168484715,"Perinatal morbidity rates are relatively high in the Netherlands, and significant inequalities in perinatal morbidity and mortality can be found across neighborhoods. In socioeconomically deprived areas, 'Western' women are particularly at risk for adverse birth outcomes. Almost all studies to date have explained the disparities in terms of individual determinants of birth outcomes. This study examines the influence of neighborhood contextual characteristics on birth weight (adjusted for gestational age) and preterm birth. We focused on the influence of neighborhood social capital--measured as informal socializing and social connections between neighbors--as well as ethnic (minority) density.Data on birth weight and prematurity were obtained from the Perinatal Registration Netherlands 2000-2008 dataset, containing 97% of all pregnancies. Neighborhood-level measurements were obtained from three different sources, comprising both survey and registration data. We included 3.422 neighborhoods and 1.527.565 pregnancies for the birth weight analysis and 1.549.285 pregnancies for the premature birth analysis. Linear and logistic multilevel regression was performed to assess the associations of individual and neighborhood level variables with birth weight and preterm birth.We found modest but significant neighborhood effects on birth weight and preterm births. The effect of ethnic (minority) density was stronger than that of neighborhood social capital. Moreover, ethnic (minority) density was associated with higher birth weight for infants of non-Western ethnic minority women compared to Western women (15 grams; 95% CI: 12,4/17,5) as well as reduced risk for prematurity (OR 0.97; CI 0,95/0,99).Our results indicate that neighborhood contexts are associated with birth weight and preterm birth in the Netherlands. Moreover, ethnic (minority) density seems to be a protective factor for non-Western ethnic minority women, but not for Western women. This helps explain the increased risk of Western women in deprived neighborhoods for adverse birth outcomes found in previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W2071632574,"During eukaryotic DNA damage response (DDR), one of the earliest events is the phosphorylation of the C-terminal SQ motif of histone H2AX (H2A in yeasts). In human cells, phosphorylated H2AX (γH2AX) is recognized by MDC1, which serves as a binding platform for the accumulation of a myriad of DDR factors on chromatin regions surrounding DNA lesions. Despite its important role in DDR, no homolog of MDC1 outside of metazoans has been described. Here, we report the characterization of Mdb1, a protein from the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, which shares significant sequence homology with human MDC1 in their C-terminal tandem BRCT (tBRCT) domains. We show that in vitro, recombinant Mdb1 protein binds a phosphorylated H2A (γH2A) peptide, and the phospho-specific binding requires two conserved phospho-binding residues in the tBRCT domain of Mdb1. In vivo, Mdb1 forms nuclear foci at DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by the HO endonuclease and ionizing radiation (IR). IR-induced Mdb1 focus formation depends on γH2A and the phospho-binding residues of Mdb1. Deleting the mdb1 gene does not overtly affect DNA damage sensitivity in a wild type background, but alters the DNA damage sensitivity of cells lacking another γH2A binder Crb2. Overexpression of Mdb1 causes severe DNA damage sensitivity in a manner that requires the interaction between Mdb1 and γH2A. During mitosis, Mdb1 localizes to spindles and concentrates at spindle midzones at late mitosis. The spindle midzone localization of Mdb1 requires its phospho-binding residues, but is independent of γH2A. Loss of Mdb1 or mutating its phospho-binding residues makes cells more resistant to the microtubule depolymerizing drug thiabendazole. We propose that Mdb1 performs dual roles in DDR and mitotic spindle regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2012911342,"The understanding of the complex genotype-phenotype architecture of human pigmentation has clear implications for the evolutionary history of humans, as well as for medical and forensic practices. Although dozens of genes have previously been associated with human skin color, knowledge about this trait remains incomplete. In particular, studies focusing on populations outside the European-North American axis are rare, and, until now, admixed populations have seldom been considered. The present study was designed to help fill this gap. Our objective was to evaluate possible associations of 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), located within nine genes, and one pseudogene with the Melanin Index (MI) in two admixed Brazilian populations (Gaucho, N = 352; Baiano, N = 148) with different histories of geographic and ethnic colonization. Of the total sample, four markers were found to be significantly associated with skin color, but only two (SLC24A5 rs1426654, and SLC45A2 rs16891982) were consistently associated with MI in both samples (Gaucho and Baiano). Therefore, only these 2 SNPs should be preliminarily considered to have forensic significance because they consistently showed the association independently of the admixture level of the populations studied. We do not discard that the other two markers (HERC2 rs1129038 and TYR rs1126809) might be also relevant to admixed samples, but additional studies are necessary to confirm the real importance of these markers for skin pigmentation. Finally, our study shows associations of some SNPs with MI in a modern Brazilian admixed sample, with possible applications in forensic genetics. Some classical genetic markers in Euro-North American populations are not associated with MI in our sample. Our results point out the relevance of considering population differences in selecting an appropriate set of SNPs as phenotype predictors in forensic practice."

Here we investigate how dorsal striatal dopamine, as measured by the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [(18)F]fluorometatyrosine (FMT), correlates with food-related decision-making, as well as body mass index (BMI) in 16 healthy-weight to moderately obese individuals. We find that lower PET FMT dopamine synthesis binding potential correlates with higher BMI, greater preference for perceived ""healthy"" foods, but also greater healthiness ratings for food items. These findings further substantiate the role of dorsal striatal dopamine in food-related behaviors and shed light on the complexity of individual differences in food preference."

The $k$-NNG algorithm has many applications in areas such as machine learning, bio-informatics, and clustering analysis. While there are very efficient algorithms for data of low dimensions, for high dimensional data the brute force search is the best algorithm. There are two main parts to the algorithm: the first part is finding the distances between the input vectors which may be formulated as a matrix multiplication problem. The second is the selection of the $k$-NNs for each of the query vectors. For the second part, we describe a novel graphics processing unit (GPU) -based multi-select algorithm based on quick sort. Our optimization makes clever use of warp voting functions available on the latest GPUs along with use-controlled cache.

Crystallogr. 2012; 68: 1207-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the residues along this cleft form hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and van der Waals contacts with not only the +1 and −1 sugar residues between which cleavage takes place but also the sugar rings located two or three residues away from the site of cleavage (3Garron M.L. Cygler M. Structural and mechanistic classification of uronic acid-containing polysaccharide lyases.Glycobiology. 2010; 20: 1547-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Instead of participating directly in catalysis, these substrate-binding residues are thought to initially attract and then precisely orient the substrate in a geometry that facilitates catalysis (10Nukui M.

Therefore, substrate specificity is derived from shaping the active site cleft to precisely fit a given polysaccharide structure and form the appropriate bonds with the various substituents of the sugar rings. Given that all PLs utilize the β-elimination mechanism and yet lyases from different families exhibit vastly different substrate specificity, understanding how the substrate-binding residues dictate specificity would allow for engineering of highly specialized lyases with numerous industrial and medical applications. These applications include polysaccharide sequence determination by cleavage with a set of well characterized lyases and subsequent analysis of oligosaccharide products (16Tøndervik A. Klinkenberg G.

Acta. 2011; 1814: 1739-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized a putative alginate lyase (Smlt1473) from the opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strain k279a (9MacDonald L.C. Berger B.W.

Chem. 2014; 289: 312-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Smlt1473 exhibited broad, yet pH-regulated substrate specificity toward both bacterial and mammalian substrates, including poly-β-d-mannuronic acid (poly-ManA), poly-GlcUA, and HA, with optimal poly-ManA activity observed at pH 9, poly-GlcUA at pH 7, and HA at pH 5. To understand the basis for pH-regulated substrate specificity of Smlt1473 and to determine roles for noncatalytic residues in substrate specificity, we identified nine putative substrate-binding residues (Lys42, Tyr115, Lys162, Arg163, Trp171, Arg218, His221, Tyr225, and Arg312) and expressed, purified, and characterized nine single mutants (K42L, Y115F, K162L, R163L, W171A, R218L, H221F, Y225F, and R312L). In particular, we find several of these mutations play key roles in altering and, in some cases, increasing both substrate specificity and overall activity. For example, H221F increases the poly-ManA activity 2-fold and shifts the ratio of poly-ManA/poly-GlcUA turnover from 0.1 to 2.0. Conversely, R312L increases poly-GlcUA activity 2.5-fold and shifts the ratio of poly-GlcUA/poly-ManA turnover from 9.6 to 340.8. Calculation of enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) revealed that mutants H221F and Y225F exhibited a 2.4-fold higher efficiency toward poly-ManA cleavage compared with wild-type Smlt1473. Collectively, our results indicate that the noncovalent interactions between noncatalytic residues and substrate are critical for not only overall enzymatic activity but also substrate specificity and optimal reaction conditions, such as pH, and can be grouped into categories based on their positioning within the active site cleft. Furthermore, the apparent structural plasticity of Smlt1473 offers possibilities for selection of lyases with enhanced specificity toward a particular polysaccharide substrate (9MacDonald L.C.

Unless otherwise stated, standard molecular biology techniques were used for subcloning and site-directed mutagenesis (20Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3 Ed.

An Escherichia coli codon-optimized nucleotide sequence of smlt1473 (corresponding to GenBankTM accession number CAQ45011) was subcloned into pET28a(+) (Invitrogen) as an NcoI-XhoI insert with no stop codon, resulting in a C-terminal His6 tag. Mutagenic primers were designed via PrimerX, and amino acid substitutions were generated via the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Nucleotide sequences containing mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (GeneWiz). For expression and purification, methods similar to those described previously (9MacDonald L.C. Berger B.W.

Soluble cell lysate was passed over a column containing 15 ml of Ni2+-bound chelating Sepharose Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated in IMAC Buffer A (20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 10 mm imidazole) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min via a BioLogic LP chromatography system (Bio-Rad) with fraction collector. The column was washed for 70 min with IMAC Buffer A to remove any unbound proteins before applying a gradient from 0 to 30% IMAC Buffer B (20 mm HEPES, 500 mm NaCl, 10% v/v glycerol, 500 mm imidazole) over the course of 80 min to wash away any nonspecifically bound proteins, and finally Smlt1473 was eluted from the column by running IMAC Buffer B for 20 min. Fractions were assayed for protein content via Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad), and samples containing purified Smlt1473 were pooled together and dialyzed against 4 liters of 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5% v/v glycerol, 20 mm imidazole for 20 h at 4 °C and then 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8, for 40 h at 4 °C with one buffer exchange. Protein concentration was determined via absorbance measurements at 280 nm, and molar extinction coefficients were estimated from primary amino acid sequences (21Wilkins M.R. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A.

Sodium alginate, medium viscosity, and hyaluronic acid, potassium salt from human umbilical cord, were obtained from MP Biomedicals. Chondroitin sulfate and poly-α-d-galacturonic acid (poly-GalA) were obtained from Alfa Aesar. Heparin and heparan sulfate were obtained from Sigma and Sagent Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Poly-GlcUA was prepared from Avicel PH-105 NF (FMC Biopolymer), and its structure was confirmed by 1H NMR as described previously (9MacDonald L.C. Berger B.W.

Poly-ManA, poly-GulA, and poly-MG block structures were prepared from sodium alginate by partial acid hydrolysis, and its structure was confirmed by 1H NMR as described previously (9MacDonald L.C.

Poly-GlcUA, poly-ManA, poly-GulA, and poly-MG samples were dialyzed against 4 liters of double distilled H2O for 40 h at 4 °C with one buffer exchange and then lyophilized. The resulting powders were stored at 4 °C until needed. The β-elimination mechanism employed by polysaccharide lyases generates a double bond between C4 and C5 of the sugar ring at the newly formed nonreducing end that can be monitored as a change in absorbance at 235 nm (22Preiss J.

Absorbance measurements were taken in 1-s intervals over the course of at least 5 min via an Ultrospec 3300 pro UV-visible spectrophotometer with a detection limit of 0.001 absorbance units at 235 nm/min. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as an increase in absorbance at 235 nm of 1.0/min at 25 °C (1 unit = 1 ΔA235 nm min−1) (9MacDonald L.C. Berger B.W.

In general, 14 μg of purified wild-type and mutant Smlt1473 was added to a solution containing 1 mg/ml substrate in a final volume of 350 μl, with the exception of poly-GlcUA, in which 1.4 μg of enzyme was added to each reaction due to higher activity against poly-GlcUA. The pH of all reactions was maintained via specific buffers for a given pH range at a total ionic strength of 30 mm (acetate for pH 4–6, phosphate for pH 5–8, Tris for pH 6–9, and glycine for pH 9–10). Additionally, the Michaelis constant (Km) and turnover number (kcat) of wild-type and mutant Smlt1473 against poly-GlcUA and poly-ManA were determined by varying polysaccharide concentrations. An extinction coefficient of 6150 m−1 cm−1 at 235 nm was used to convert absorbance to product concentration (23Farrell E.K. Tipton P.A. Functional characterization of AlgL, an alginate lyase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Biochemistry. 2012; 51: 10259-10266Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Initial rates (vi) were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, v = kcatE0S/(Km + S), via the generalized reduced gradient (GRG2) nonlinear optimization program (24Fylstra D. Lasdon L. Watson J. Waren A. Design and use of the Microsoft Excel Solver.Interfaces. 1998; 28: 29-55Crossref Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The R2 and correlation values for each substrate were greater than 0.943 and 0.944, respectively. All reactions were carried out in triplicate, and error is reported as standard deviation. Lyase activity was independently determined via a thiobarbituric acid assay in which the unsaturated product is converted to a pre-chromogen by oxidation with periodic acid and then reacted with thiobarbituric acid to form a pink chromogen with an absorbance maximum of 550 nm (25Weissbach A.

For these experiments, 4 μg of purified enzyme (0.4 μg for poly-GlcUA) was mixed to solutions containing 1 mg/ml substrate in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 5 min before heating the samples at 100 °C for 10 min to degrade the enzyme and stop the reaction. According to the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) database, Smlt1473 belongs to polysaccharide lyase family 5 (PL-5), which currently contains a total of 105 lyases (2Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M.

The primary amino acid sequence of each PL-5 lyase was downloaded and parsed to remove any entry that shared a greater than 95% pairwise sequence identity with another entry in an effort to reduce redundancy in the database. The remaining 50 lyases, including Spingomonas sp. A1 (PDB code 1QAZ) (11Yoon H.J. Mikami B. Hashimoto W. Murata K.

https://openalex.org/W2157391139,"The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains underscores the importance of identifying new drug targets and developing new antimicrobial compounds. Lysine and meso-diaminopimelic acid are essential for protein production and bacterial peptidoglycan cell wall remodeling and are synthesized in bacteria by enzymes encoded within dap operon. Therefore dap enzymes may serve as excellent targets for developing a new class of antimicrobial agents. The dapE-encoded N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid desuccinylase (DapE) converts N-succinyl-L,L-diaminopimelic acid to L,L-diaminopimelic acid and succinate. The enzyme is composed of catalytic and dimerization domains, and belongs to the M20 peptidase family. To understand the specific role of each domain of the enzyme we engineered dimerization domain deletion mutants of DapEs from Haemophilus influenzae and Vibrio cholerae, and characterized these proteins structurally and biochemically. No activity was observed for all deletion mutants. Structural comparisons of wild-type, inactive monomeric DapE enzymes with other M20 peptidases suggest that the dimerization domain is essential for DapE enzymatic activity. Structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulations indicate that removal of the dimerization domain increased the flexibility of a conserved active site loop that may provide critical interactions with the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2061064542,"The importance of early experience in animals’ life is unquestionable, and imprinting-like phenomena may shape important aspects of behaviour. Early learning typically occurs during a sensitive period, which restricts crucial processes of information storage to a specific developmental phase. The characteristics of the sensitive period have been largely investigated in vertebrates, because of their complexity and plasticity, both in behaviour and neurophysiology, but early learning occurs also in invertebrates. In social insects, early learning appears to influence important social behaviours such as nestmate recognition. Yet, the mechanisms underlying recognition systems are not fully understood. It is currently believed that Polistes social wasps are able to discriminate nestmates from non-nestmates following the perception of olfactory cues present on the paper of their nest, which are learned during a strict sensitive period, immediately after emergence. Here, through differential odour experience experiments, we show that workers of Polistes dominula develop correct nestmate recognition abilities soon after emergence even in absence of what have been so far considered the necessary cues (the chemicals spread on nest paper). P. dominula workers were exposed for the first four days of adult life to paper fragments from their nest, or from a foreign conspecific nest or to a neutral condition. Wasps were then transferred to their original nests where recognition abilities were tested. Our results show that wasps do not alter their recognition ability if exposed only to nest material, or in absence of nest material, during the early phase of adult life. It thus appears that the nest paper is not used as a source of recognition cues to be learned in a specific time window, although we discuss possible alternative explanations. Our study provides a novel perspective for the study of the ontogeny of nestmate recognition in Polistes wasps and in other social insects."
https://openalex.org/W2067877288,"NOD1 is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that recognizes diaminopimelic acid (DAP), a peptidoglycan component in gram negative bacteria. Upon ligand binding, NOD1 assembles with receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-2 kinase and initiates a signaling cascade leading to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Increased NOD1 signaling has been associated with a variety of inflammatory disorders suggesting that small-molecule inhibitors of this signaling complex may have therapeutic utility. We utilized a cell-based screening approach with extensive selectivity profiling to search for small molecule inhibitors of the NOD1 signaling pathway. Via this process we identified three distinct chemical series, xanthines (SB711), quinazolininones (GSK223) and aminobenzothiazoles (GSK966) that selectively inhibited iE-DAP-stimulated IL-8 release via the NOD1 signaling pathway. All three of the newly identified compound series failed to block IL-8 secretion in cells following stimulation with ligands for TNF receptor, TLR2 or NOD2 and, in addition, none of the compound series directly inhibited RIP2 kinase activity. Our initial exploration of the structure-activity relationship and physicochemical properties of the three series directed our focus to the quinazolininone biarylsulfonamides (GSK223). Further investigation allowed for the identification of significantly more potent analogs with the largest boost in activity achieved by fluoro to chloro replacement on the central aryl ring. These results indicate that the NOD1 signaling pathway, similarly to activation of NOD2, is amenable to modulation by small molecules that do not target RIP2 kinase. These compounds should prove useful tools to investigate the importance of NOD1 activation in various inflammatory processes and have potential clinical utility in diseases driven by hyperactive NOD1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2064427517,"Cellular microenvironments, particularly those found in tumors, elicit a tolerogenic DC phenotype which can attenuate immune responses. Central to this process is the STAT3-mediated signaling cascade. As a transcription factor and oncogene, STAT3 promotes the expression of genes which allow tumor cells to proliferate, migrate and evade apoptosis. More importantly, activation of STAT3 in tumor infiltrating immune cells has been shown to be responsible, in part, for their immune-suppressed phenotype. The ability of STAT3 to orchestrate a diverse set of immunosuppressive instructions has made it an attractive target for cancer vaccines. Using a conditional hematopoietic knockout mouse model of STAT3, we evaluated the impact of STAT3 gene ablation on the differentiation of dendritic cells from bone marrow precursors. We also assessed the impact of STAT3 deletion on phagocytosis, maturation, cytokine secretion and antigen presentation by GM-CSF derived DCs in vitro. In addition to in vitro studies, we compared the therapeutic efficacy of DC vaccination using STAT3 deficient DCs to wild type counterparts in an intracranial mouse model of GBM. Our results indicated the following pleiotropic functions of STAT3: hematopoietic cells which lacked STAT3 were unresponsive to Flt3L and failed to differentiate as DCs. In contrast, STAT3 was not required for GM-CSF induced DC differentiation as both wild type and STAT3 null bone marrow cells gave rise to similar number of DCs. STAT3 also appeared to regulate the response of GM-CSF derived DCs to CpG. STAT3 null DCs expressed high levels of MHC-II, secreted more IL-12p70, IL-10, and TNFα were better antigen presenters in vitro. Although STAT3 deficient DCs displayed an enhanced activated phenotype in culture, they elicited comparable therapeutic efficacy in vivo compared to their wild type counterparts when utilized in vaccination paradigms in mice bearing intracranial glioma tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2024562854,"In fragmented landscapes, plant species richness may depend not only on local habitat conditions but also on landscape structure. In addition, both present and past landscape structure may be important for species richness. There are, however, only a few studies that have investigated the relative importance of all of these factors. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of current and past landscape structures and habitat conditions on species richness at dry grassland-like forest openings in a forested landscape and to assess their relative importance for species richness. We analyzed information on past and present landscape structures using aerial photographs from 1938, 1973, 1988, 2000 and 2007. We calculated the area of each locality and its isolation in the present and in the past and the continuity of localities in GIS. At each locality, we recorded all vascular plant species (296 species in 110 forest openings) and information on abiotic conditions of the localities. We found that the current species richness of the forest openings was significantly determined by local habitat conditions as well as by landscape structure in the present and in the past. The highest species richness was observed on larger and more heterogeneous localities with rocks and shallow soils, which were already large and well connected to other localities in 1938. The changes in the landscape structure in the past can thus have strong effects on current species richness. Future studies attempting to understand determinants of species diversity in fragmented landscapes should also include data on past landscape structure, as it may in fact be more important than the present structure."
https://openalex.org/W1990891270,"The lunchtime and after-school contexts are critical windows in a school day for children to be physically active. While numerous studies have investigated correlates of children's habitual physical activity, few have explored correlates of physical activity occurring at lunchtime and after-school from a social-ecological perspective. Exploring correlates that influence physical activity occurring in specific contexts can potentially improve the prediction and understanding of physical activity. Using a context-specific approach, this study investigated correlates of children's lunchtime and after-school physical activity.Cross-sectional data were collected from 423 South Australian children aged 10.0-13.9 years (200 boys; 223 girls) attending 10 different schools. Lunchtime and after-school physical activity was assessed using accelerometers. Correlates were assessed using purposely developed context-specific questionnaires. Correlated Component Regression analysis was conducted to derive correlates of context-specific physical activity and determine the variance explained by prediction equations.The model of boys' lunchtime physical activity contained 6 correlates and explained 25% of the variance. For girls, the model explained 17% variance from 9 correlates. Enjoyment of walking during lunchtime was the strongest correlate for both boys and girls. Boys' and girls' after-school physical activity models explained 20% variance from 14 correlates and 7% variance from the single item correlate, ""I do an organised sport or activity after-school because it gets you fit"", respectively.Increasing specificity of correlate research has enabled the identification of unique features of, and a more in-depth interpretation of, lunchtime and after-school physical activity behaviour and is a potential strategy for advancing the physical activity correlate research field. The findings of this study could be used to inform and tailor gender-specific public health messages and interventions for promoting lunchtime and after-school physical activity in children."

Rb/E2F-associated apoptosis has been demonstrated to be associated with the loss of constitutive transcriptional repression by Rb/E2F complexes and mediated by caspase-8. Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) PTP-1B and SHP-2 have been previously shown to be directly activated by loss of Rb/E2F repression during Rb/E2F-associated apoptosis. In this current study, we demonstrate that the PTEN tumor suppressor is also directly activated by loss of Rb/E2F repression. We also demonstrate that PTP-1B, SHP-2, and PTEN play a functional role in Rb/E2F-associated apoptosis. Knockdown of PTP1B, SHP2, or PTEN expression with small interfering RNA (siRNA) in apoptotic cells increases cell viability and rescues cells from the Rb/E2F-associated apoptotic response. Furthermore, rescue from apoptosis coincides with inhibition of caspase-8 and caspase-3 cleavage (activation). Our results indicate PTP-1B, SHP-2, and PTEN all play a functional role in Rb/E2F-associated apoptotic signal transduction and provide further evidence that PTP-1B, SHP-2, and PTEN can contribute to tumor suppression through an Rb/E2F-associated mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2065723443,"Prep1 and Meis1 ortholog TALE transcription factors have opposing roles in tumorigenesis: Meis1 serves as an oncogene, Prep1 as a tumor suppressor. We now report that, Meis1 overexpression in primary Prep1-deficient (Prep1i/i) embryonic hematopoietic cells increases self-renewal potential of cells in vitro but not in vivo, whereas leukemia is instead obtained when Meis1 is combined with another oncogene, HoxA9. Prep1i/i Meis1-HoxA9-generated leukemic cells are less differentiated and grow more aggressively after the second passage in the mouse. These data indicate that Prep1 represents a barrier to the transforming activity of Meis1 in vitro, but its absence is not sufficient to induce early leukemogenesis. On the other hand, the Prep1i/i background appears to favor the insurgence of mutations that cause a more aggressive Meis1-HoxA9-generated leukemia. Indeed, the Prep1i/i leukemic cells upregulate the Polycomb protein Bmi-1 and expectedly down-regulate the Ink4a/Arf locus products. Finally, an important feature contributed by the Prep1i/i background is the post-transcriptional increase in Meis1 protein level."
https://openalex.org/W1999161242,"The trend of rising scores on intelligence tests raises important questions about the comparability of variation within and between time periods. Descriptions of the processes that mediate selection of item responses provide meaningful psychological criteria upon which to base such comparisons. In a recent paper, Fox and Mitchum presented and tested a cognitive theory of rising scores on analogical and inductive reasoning tests that is specific enough to make novel predictions about cohort differences in patterns of item responses for tests such as the Raven’s Matrices. In this paper we extend the same proposal in two important ways by (1) testing it against a dataset that enables the effects of cohort to be isolated from those of age, and (2) applying it to two other inductive reasoning tests that exhibit large Flynn effects: Letter Series and Word Series. Following specification and testing of a confirmatory item response model, predicted violations of measurement invariance are observed between two age-matched cohorts that are separated by only 20 years, as members of the later cohort are found to map objects at higher levels of abstraction than members of the earlier cohort who possess the same overall level of ability. Results have implications for the Flynn effect and cognitive aging while underscoring the value of establishing psychological criteria for equating members of distinct groups who achieve the same scores."
https://openalex.org/W2021427223,"Purpose The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the retinal toxicity of a single dose of intravitreal docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in rabbit eyes over a short-term period. Methods Sixteen New Zealand albino rabbits were selected for this pre-clinical study. Six concentrations of DHA (Brudy Laboratories, Barcelona, Spain) were prepared: 10 mg/50 µl, 5 mg/50 µl, 2’5 mg/50 µl, 50 µg/50 µl, 25 µg/50 µl, and 5 µg/50 µl. Each concentration was injected intravitreally in the right eye of two rabbits. As a control, the vehicle solution was injected in one eye of four animals. Retinal safety was studied by slit-lamp examination, and electroretinography. All the rabbits were euthanized one week after the intravitreal injection of DHA and the eyeballs were processed to morphologic and morphometric histological examination by light microscopy. At the same time aqueous and vitreous humor samples were taken to quantify the concentration of omega-3 acids by gas chromatography. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 21.0. Results Slit-lamp examination revealed an important inflammatory reaction on the anterior chamber of the rabbits injected with the higher concentrations of DHA (10 mg/50 µl, 5 mg/50 µl, 2'5 mg/50 µ) Lower concentrations showed no inflammation. Electroretinography and histological studies showed no significant difference between control and DHA-injected groups except for the group injected with 50 µg/50 µl. Conclusions Our results indicate that administration of intravitreal DHA is safe in the albino rabbit model up to the maximum tolerated dose of 25 µg/50 µl. Further studies should be performed in order to evaluate the effect of intravitreal injection of DHA as a treatment, alone or in combination, of different retinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2063579720,"Background A significant number of parents are unaware or unconvinced of the health consequences of passive smoking (PS) in children. Physicians could increase parental awareness by giving personal advice. Aim To evaluate the current practices of three Dutch health professions (paediatricians, youth health care physicians, and family physicians) regarding parental counselling for passive smoking (PS) in children. Methods All physicians (n = 720) representing the three health professions in Limburg, the Netherlands, received an invitation to complete a self-administered electronic questionnaire including questions on their: sex, work experience, personal smoking habits, counselling practices and education regarding PS in children. Results The response rate was 34%. One tenth (11%) of the responding physicians always addressed PS in children, 32% often, 54% occasionally and 4% reported to never attend to it. The three health professions appeared comparable regarding their frequency of parental counselling for PS in children. Addressing PS was more likely when children had respiratory problems. Lack of time was the most frequently mentioned barrier, being very and somewhat applicable for respectively 14% and 43% of the physicians. One fourth of the responders had received postgraduate education about PS. Additionally, 49% of the responders who did not have any education about PS were interested in receiving it. Conclusions Physicians working in the paediatric field in Limburg, the Netherlands, could more frequently address PS in children with parents. Lack of time appeared to be the most mentioned barrier and physicians were more likely to counsel parents for PS in children with respiratory complaints/diseases. Finally, a need for more education on parental counselling for PS was expressed."
https://openalex.org/W2151929162,"The aim is to examine the association of lifecourse socioeconomic position (SEP) on circulating levels of D-dimer. Data from the 1958 British birth cohort were used, social class was determined at three stages of respondents' life: at birth, at 23 and at 42 years. A cumulative indicator score of SEP (CIS) was calculated ranging from 0 (always in the highest social class) to 9 (always in the lowest social class). In men and women, associations were observed between CIS and D-dimer (P<0.05). Thus, the respondents in more disadvantaged social classes had elevated levels of D-dimer compared to respondents in less disadvantaged social class. In multivariate analyses, the association of disadvantaged social position with D-dimer was largely explained by fibrinogen, C-reactive protein and von Willebrand Factor in women, and additionally by smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activity in men. Socioeconomic circumstances across the lifecourse at various stages also contribute independently to raised levels of D-dimer in middle age in women only. Risk exposure related to SEP accumulates across life and contributes to raised levels of D-dimer. The association of haemostatic markers and social differences in health may be mediated by inflammatory and other markers."
https://openalex.org/W2006533653,"Hybrid lethality is expressed at 28°C in the cross Nicotiana nudicaulis×N. tabacum. The S subgenome of N. tabacum has been identified as controlling this hybrid lethality. To clarify the responsible genomic factor(s) of N. nudicaulis, we crossed N. trigonophylla (paternal progenitor of N. nudicaulis) with N. tabacum, because hybrids between N. sylvestris (maternal progenitor of N. nudicaulis) and N. tabacum are viable when grown in a greenhouse. In the cross N. trigonophylla×N. tabacum, approximately 50% of hybrids were vitrified, 20% were viable, and 20% were nonviable at 28°C. To reveal which subgenome of N. tabacum was responsible for these phenotypes, we crossed N. trigonophylla with two progenitors of N. tabacum, N. sylvestris (SS) and N. tomentosiformis (TT). In the cross N. sylvestris×N. trigonophylla, we confirmed that over half of hybrids of N. sylvestris×N. trigonophylla were vitrified, and none of the hybrids of N. trigonophylla×N. tomentosiformis were. The results imply that the S subgenome, encoding a gene or genes inducing hybrid lethality in the cross between N. nudicaulis and N. tabacum, has one or more genomic factors that induce vitrification. Furthermore, in vitrified hybrids of N. trigonophylla×N. tabacum and N. sylvestris×N. trigonophylla, we found that nuclear fragmentation, which progresses during expression of hybrid lethality, was accompanied by vitrification. This observation suggests that vitrification has a relationship to hybrid lethality. Based on these results, we speculate that when N. nudicaulis was formed approximately 5 million years ago, several causative genomic factors determining phenotypes of hybrid seedlings were inherited from N. trigonophylla. Subsequently, genome downsizing and various recombination-based processes took place. Some of the causative genomic factors were lost and some became genomic factor(s) controlling hybrid lethality in extant N. nudicaulis."
