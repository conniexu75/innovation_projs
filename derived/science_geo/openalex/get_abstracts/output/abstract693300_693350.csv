https://openalex.org/W4229445969,"Despite success in hematologic malignancies, the treatment landscape of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy for solid tumors remains limited. Claudin18.2 (CLDN18.2)-redirected CAR T cells showed promising efficacy against gastric cancer (GC) in a preclinical study. Here we report the interim analysis results of an ongoing, open-label, single-arm, phase 1 clinical trial of CLDN18.2-targeted CAR T cells (CT041) in patients with previously treated, CLDN18.2-positive digestive system cancers ( NCT03874897 ). The primary objective was safety after CT041 infusion; secondary objectives included CT041 efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. We treated 37 patients with one of three CT041 doses: 2.5 × 108, 3.75 × 108 or 5.0 × 108 cells. All patients experienced a grade 3 or higher hematologic toxicity. Grade 1 or 2 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in 94.6% of patients. No grade 3 or higher CRS or neurotoxicities, treatment-related deaths or dose-limiting toxicities were reported. The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) reached 48.6% and 73.0%, respectively. The 6-month duration of response rate was 44.8%. In patients with GC, the ORR and DCR reached 57.1% and 75.0%, respectively, and the 6-month overall survival rate was 81.2%. These initial results suggest that CT041 has promising efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated, CLDN18.2-positive digestive system cancers, particularly in those with GC."
https://openalex.org/W4229455035,"Abstract Estimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of unrelated individuals capture effects of inherited variation (direct effects), demography (population stratification, assortative mating) and relatives (indirect genetic effects). Family-based GWAS designs can control for demographic and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data from 178,086 siblings from 19 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) GWAS estimates for 25 phenotypes. Within-sibship GWAS estimates were smaller than population estimates for height, educational attainment, age at first birth, number of children, cognitive ability, depressive symptoms and smoking. Some differences were observed in downstream SNP heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization analyses. For example, the within-sibship genetic correlation between educational attainment and body mass index attenuated towards zero. In contrast, analyses of most molecular phenotypes (for example, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) were generally consistent. We also found within-sibship evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller height. Here, we illustrate the importance of family-based GWAS data for phenotypes influenced by demographic and indirect genetic effects."
https://openalex.org/W4229449309,"Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors. There are no effective medical therapies for meningioma patients, and new treatments have been encumbered by limited understanding of meningioma biology. Here, we use DNA methylation profiling on 565 meningiomas integrated with genetic, transcriptomic, biochemical, proteomic and single-cell approaches to show meningiomas are composed of three DNA methylation groups with distinct clinical outcomes, biological drivers and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Merlin-intact meningiomas (34%) have the best outcomes and are distinguished by NF2/Merlin regulation of susceptibility to cytotoxic therapy. Immune-enriched meningiomas (38%) have intermediate outcomes and are distinguished by immune infiltration, HLA expression and lymphatic vessels. Hypermitotic meningiomas (28%) have the worst outcomes and are distinguished by convergent genetic and epigenetic mechanisms driving the cell cycle and resistance to cytotoxic therapy. To translate these findings into clinical practice, we show cytostatic cell cycle inhibitors attenuate meningioma growth in cell culture, organoids, xenografts and patients. DNA methylation profiling of 565 meningiomas highlights three groups associated with distinct molecular, clinical and therapeutic features."
https://openalex.org/W4229444496,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex chronic disease characterized by considerable phenotypic heterogeneity. In this study, we applied a reverse graph embedding method to routinely collected data from 23,137 Scottish patients with newly diagnosed diabetes to visualize this heterogeneity and used partitioned diabetes polygenic risk scores to gain insight into the underlying biological processes. Overlaying risk of progression to outcomes of insulin requirement, chronic kidney disease, referable diabetic retinopathy and major adverse cardiovascular events, we show how these risks differ by patient phenotype. For example, patients at risk of retinopathy are phenotypically different from those at risk of cardiovascular events. We replicated our findings in the UK Biobank and the ADOPT clinical trial, also showing that the pattern of diabetes drug monotherapy response differs for different drugs. Overall, our analysis highlights how, in a European population, underlying phenotypic variation drives T2D onset and affects subsequent diabetes outcomes and drug response, demonstrating the need to incorporate these factors into personalized treatment approaches for the management of T2D."
https://openalex.org/W4229444885,"Higher viral loads in SARS-CoV-2 infections may be linked to more rapid spread of emerging variants of concern (VOC). Rapid detection and isolation of cases with highest viral loads, even in pre- or asymptomatic individuals, is essential for the mitigation of community outbreaks.In this study, we analyze Ct values from 1297 SARS-CoV-2 positive patient saliva samples collected at the Clemson University testing lab in upstate South Carolina. Samples were identified as positive using RT-qPCR, and clade information was determined via whole genome sequencing at nearby commercial labs. We also obtained patient-reported information on symptoms and exposures at the time of testing. The lowest Ct values were observed among those infected with Delta (median: 22.61, IQR: 16.72-28.51), followed by Alpha (23.93, 18.36-28.49), Gamma (24.74, 18.84-30.64), and the more historic clade 20G (25.21, 20.50-29.916). There was a statistically significant difference in Ct value between Delta and all other clades (all p.adj<0.01), as well as between Alpha and 20G (p.adj<0.05). Additionally, pre- or asymptomatic patients (n = 1093) showed the same statistical differences between Delta and all other clades (all p.adj<0.01); however, symptomatic patients (n = 167) did not show any significant differences between clades. Our weekly testing strategy ensures that cases are caught earlier in the infection cycle, often before symptoms are present, reducing this sample size in our population.COVID-19 variants Alpha and Delta have substantially higher viral loads in saliva compared to more historic clades. This trend is especially observed in individuals who are pre- or asymptomatic, which provides evidence supporting higher transmissibility and more rapid spread of emerging variants. Understanding the viral load of variants spreading within a community can inform public policy and clinical decision making."

https://openalex.org/W4280649942,"Natural compounds are proper tools for inhibiting cancer cell proliferation. Hence, the search for these ligands of overexpressed receptors in breast cancer has been a competitive challenge recently and opens new avenues for drug discovery. In this research, we have investigated molecular interactions between natural products and overexpressed receptors in breast cancer using molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches followed by extraction of the best ligand from Citrus limetta and developing for nanoscale encapsulation composed of soy lecithin using a sonicator machine. The encapsulation process was confirmed by DLS and TEM analyses. Anticancer activity was also examined using MTT method. Among the investigated natural compounds, hesperidin was found to bind to specific targets with stronger binding energy. The molecular dynamics results indicated that the hesperidin-MCL-1 complex is very stable at 310.15 K for 200 ns. The RP-HPLC analysis revealed that the purity of extracted hesperidin was 98.8% with a yield of 1.72%. The results of DLS and TEM showed a strong interaction between hesperidin and lecithin with an entrapped efficiency of 92.02 ± 1.08%. Finally, the cytotoxicity effect of hesperidin was increased against the MDA-MB-231 cell line with an IC50 value of 62.93 μg/mL after encapsulation, whereas no significant effect against the MCF10A cell line. We showed for the first time that hesperidin is a flexible and strong ligand for the MCL-1 receptor. Also, it has the in vitro ability to kill the MDA-MB-231 cell lines without having a significant effect on the MCF10A cell lines. Therefore, hesperidin could be used as a food ingredient to generate functional foods."

https://openalex.org/W4229441137,"In 2018, the right to lawful abortion in the Republic of Ireland significantly expanded, and service provision commenced on 1 January, 2019. Community provision of early medical abortion to 9 weeks plus 6 days gestation delivered by General Practitioners constitutes the backbone of the Irish abortion policy implementation. We conducted a study in 2020-2021 to examine the barriers and facilitators of the Irish abortion policy implementation.We collected data using qualitative in-depth interviews (IDIs) which were conducted in-person or remotely. We coded and analysed interview transcripts following the grounded theory approach.We collected 108 IDIs in Ireland from May 2020 to March 2021. This article draws on 79 IDIs with three participant samples directly relevant to the community model of care: (a) 27 key informants involved in the abortion policy development and implementation representing government healthcare administration, medical professionals, and advocacy organisations, (b) 22 healthcare providers involved in abortion provision in community settings, and (c) 30 service users who sought abortion services in 2020. Facilitators of community-based abortion provision have been: a collaborative approach between the Irish government and the medical community to develop the model of care, and strong support systems for providers. The MyOptions helpline for service users is a successful national referral model. The main barriers to provision are the mandatory 3-day wait, unclear or slow referral pathways from primary to hospital care, barriers for migrants, and a shortage and incomplete geographic distribution of providers, especially in rural areas.We conclude that access to abortion care in Ireland has been greatly expanded since the policy implementation in 2019. The community delivery of care and the national helpline constitute key features of the Irish abortion policy implementation that could be duplicated in other contexts and countries. Several challenges to full abortion policy implementation remain."
https://openalex.org/W4229440086,"Centromeres are defined epigenetically by the histone H3 variant CENP-A. The propagation cycle by which pre-existing CENP-A nucleosomes serve as templates for nascent assembly predicts the epigenetic memory of weakened centromeres. Using a mouse model with reduced levels of CENP-A nucleosomes, we find that an embryonic plastic phase precedes epigenetic memory through development. During this phase, nascent CENP-A nucleosome assembly depends on the maternal Cenpa genotype rather than the pre-existing template. Weakened centromeres are thus limited to a single generation, and parental epigenetic differences are eliminated by equal assembly on maternal and paternal centromeres. These differences persist, however, when the underlying DNA of parental centromeres differs in repeat abundance, as assembly during the plastic phase also depends on sufficient repetitive centromere DNA. With contributions of centromere DNA and the Cenpa maternal effect, we propose that centromere inheritance naturally minimizes fitness costs associated with weakened centromeres or epigenetic differences between parents. Das et al. show that chromatin incorporation of histone H3 variant CENP-A at centromeres in early mouse embryos depends on the maternally provided Cenpa mRNA pool and on repetitive centromere satellite DNA, rather than pre-existing CENP-A nucleosomes."

https://openalex.org/W4229441870,"Trans-generational immune priming involves the transfer of immunological experience, acquired by the parents after exposure to pathogens, to protect their progeny against infections by these pathogens. Such natural mechanisms could be exploited to prevent disease expression in economically important insects, such as the honey bee. This mechanism occurs when honey bee queens are exposed to the pathogenic bacterium Paenibacillus larvae . Here, we tested whether natural or experimental exposure to Melissococcus plutonius —another bacterium triggering a disease in honey bee larvae—reduced the susceptibility of the queen’s progeny to infection by this pathogen. Because the immunological response upon pathogen exposure can lead to fitness costs, we also determined whether experimental exposure of the queens affected them or their colony negatively. Neither natural nor experimental exposure induced protection in the honey bee larvae against the deleterious effects of M . plutonius . Our results provided no evidence for the occurrence of trans-generational immune priming upon exposure of the queen to M . plutonius . Whether this lack was due to confounding genetic resistance, to unsuitable exposure procedure or to the absence of trans-generational immune priming against this pathogen in honey bees remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W4229450946,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa has different resistant mechanisms including the constitutive MexAB-OprM efflux pump. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mexR, nalC, and nalD repressors of this efflux pump can contribute to antimicrobial resistance; however, it is unknown whether these changes are mainly related to genetic lineages or environmental pressure. This study identifies SNPs in the mexR, nalC, and nalD genes in clinical and environmental isolates of P. aeruginosa (including high-risk clones). Ninety-one P. aeruginosa strains were classified according to their resistance to antibiotics, typified by multilocus sequencing, and mexR, nalC, and nalD genes sequenced for SNPs identification. The mexAB-oprM transcript expression was determined. The 96.7% of the strains were classified as multidrug resistant. Eight strains produced serine carbapenemases, and 11 strains metallo-β-lactamases. Twenty-three new STs and high-risk clones ST111 and ST233 were identified. SNPs in the mexR, nalC, and nalD genes revealed 27 different haplotypes (patterns). Sixty-two mutational changes were identified, 13 non-synonymous. Haplotype 1 was the most frequent (n = 40), and mainly identified in strains ST1725 (33/40), with 57.5% pan drug resistant strains, 36.5% extensive drug resistant and two strains exhibiting serin-carbapenemases. Haplotype 12 (n = 9) was identified in ST233 and phylogenetically related STs, with 100% of the strains exhibiting XDR and 90% producing metallo-β-lactamases. Haplotype 5 was highly associated with XDR and related to dead when compared to ST1725 and ST233 (RRR 23.34; p = 0.009 and RRR 32.01; p = 0.025). A significant relationship between the mexR-nalC-nalD haplotypes and phylogenetically related STs was observed, suggesting mutational changes in these repressors are highly maintained within genetic lineages. In addition, phylogenetically related STs showed similar resistant profiles; however, the resistance was (likely or partly) attributed to the MexAB-OprM efflux pump in 56% of the strains (only 45.05% showed mexA overtranscription), in the remaining strains the resistance could be attributed to carbapenemases or mechanisms including other pumps, since same SNPs in the repressor genes gave rise to different resistance profiles."

Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected consecutively from COVID-19 PCR positive and COVID-19 PCR negative participants at isolation centers and points of entry, and tested with the SARS-CoV-2 Ag RDTs. Test sensitivity and specificity were generated by comparing results against qRT-PCR results (Berlin Protocol) at a cycle threshold (Ct) cut-off of ≤39. Sensitivity was also calculated at Ct cut-offs ≤29 and ≤33.None of the Ag RDTs had a sensitivity of ≥80% at Ct cut-off values ≤33 and ≤39. Two kits, Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag and VivaDiag™ SARS-CoV-2 Ag had a sensitivity of ≥80% at a Ct cut-off value of ≤29. Four kits: BIOCREDIT COVID -19 Ag, COVID-19 Ag Respi-Strip, MEDsan® SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test and Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test had a specificity of ≥97%.This evaluation identified one Ag RDT, Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag with a performance at high viral load (Ct value ≤29) reaching that recommended by WHO. This kit was recommended for screening of patients with COVID -19-like symptoms presenting at health facilities."

https://openalex.org/W4280599359,"Restriction of gathering size in all public areas is a newly and commonly exercised governmental social distancing policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. Its effectiveness depends on the general public's compliance. This study applied the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to investigate determinants (i.e., perceived severity, perceived susceptibility, perceived response efficacy, and perceived self-efficacy) of compliance with the social distancing policy of banning gathering of >4 people in all public areas (BG4PA) in the Hong Kong general adult population.300 participants were interviewed through a population-based telephone survey during April 21-28, 2020.The compliance rate of BG4PA was high (78%). Adjusted for the background factors, multiple linear regression analysis found that perceived response efficacy and perceived self-efficacy were significantly and positively associated with compliance with BG4PA (p<0.05), while the associations between perceived severity/perceived susceptibility and compliance were of marginal significance (0.05<p<0.10). A stepwise linear regression model considered four PMT constructs as candidates; its final model only selected self-efficacy but not the other three PMT constructs.PMT can be applied to understand compliance with BG4PA. Perceived response efficacy and perceived self-efficacy were more influential than perceived severity and perceived susceptibility. Health promotion may focus on improving coping appraisal."

https://openalex.org/W4229453765,"Anemia is a disorder by which the body's red blood cells are inadequate to fulfill The physiological needs of the body. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as having a hemoglobin (Hb) level of less than 120 g/l for nonpregnant women and 110 g/l for pregnant women. It has serious implications for human health as well as negative social and economic consequences like decreased workforce, impaired learning, and stunted child development. As these women are highly vulnerable to different micro and macro-nutritive deficiency associated with rapid physical, mental and psychological development, particular attention should be given to a young woman (15-24). Therefore this study assesses the magnitude and determinants of anemia among young women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).This was a secondary data analysis based on the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) data conducted in sub-Saharan Africa. We pooled the most recent DHS surveys done in 31 sub-Sahara Africa and a total weighted sample of 88, 832 young women (15-24 years) were included. At bivariable analysis, variables with a p-value of ≤0.2 were selected for multivariable analysis, and at the multivariable analysis variables with a p-value of ≤0.05 were considered as a significant factor associated with anemia among young women (15-24 years).The pooled prevalence of anemia among young women (15-24) in sub-Sahara Africa was 42.17% [95%CI: 41.85, 42.50]. Young women of aged 20-24 years [AOR = 0.92, 95%CI: 0.89-0.95], women from rich household [AOR = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.80-0.87], young women with primary [AOR = 0.7, 95%CI: 0.67-0.72], secondary [AOR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.69-0.75] and higher educational status [AOR = 0.58, 95%CI: 0.53-0.64], married women [AOR = 1.12, 95%CI: 1.08-1.17], divorced/separated/widowed women [AOR = 1.16, 95%CI: 1.08-1.25], women who use modern contraceptive [AOR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.62-0.67], young women who ever had terminated pregnancy [AOR = 1.22, 95%CI: 1.14-1.29], overweight young woman [AOR = 0.79, 95%CI: 0.76-0.82] and young women from female-headed household [AOR = 0.94, 95%CI: 0.91-0.97] were the individual-level factors that significantly associated with anemia of young women. Meanwhile, being a rural dweller [AOR = 0.82, 95%CI: 0.79-0.85] and high community educational level [AOR = 0.87, 95%CI: 0.70-0.97] were the community level determinant of anemia. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC), Median Odds Ratio (MOR) and Percentage change in variance (PCV) were done for the assessment of the random effect model of the multilevel analysis. The ICC value in the null model was 0.05, which indicates that 5% of the variation in anemia among young women in sub-Saharan Africa was attributed to community-level factors.The prevalence of anemia among young women in this study was higher compared with reports from the previous studies. Divorced/separated/widowed women, married women and women with ever terminated pregnancy, young women with primary, secondary and higher educational achievement, being rural dwellers, young women aged 20-24 years, being from rich households and women who used modern contraceptives were factors that significantly associated with anemia among young women. Therefore, particular attention should be given to those higher-risk women including, young women with a history of a terminated pregnancy, those from rural areas and young women aged 15-19 years to reduce the burden of anemia among these young women as the continuity of the future generation depends on the health of young women."
https://openalex.org/W4280585549,"We aimed to determine whether various novel inflammatory, angiogenic, and extracellular matrix-related mediators in amniotic fluid (AF) can independently predict emergency cerclage outcomes in women with acute cervical insufficiency (CI).This was a retrospective cohort study conducted among 50 singleton pregnant women (18-25 weeks) who underwent emergency cerclage for CI and were subjected to amniocentesis. The AF samples were assayed for endoglin, endostatin, haptoglobin, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, -4, kallistatin, lumican, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), pentraxin 3, p-selectin, receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), resistin, transforming growth factor beta-induced (TGFBI), and vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) levels. Interleukin (IL)-6 levels in the AF were also measured for comparison with potential biomarkers assessed in this study. The primary endpoint was spontaneous preterm delivery (SPTD) at <34 weeks following emergency cerclage.The AF levels of pentraxin 3, RAGE, and resistin were significantly higher in women who had SPTD at <34 weeks after cerclage placement (pentraxin-3: P = 0.003; RAGE: P = 0.041; and resistin; P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, elevated AF levels of pentraxin 3 (P = 0.007) and resistin (P = 0.006), but not those of RAGE (P = 0.069), were independently associated with the occurrence of SPTD at <34 weeks after cerclage, following adjustment for baseline clinical variables (e.g., cervical dilation). The area under the curve (AUC) values of AF pentraxin 3, RAGE, and resistin for the prediction of SPTD at <34 weeks were 0.749, 0.669, and 0.770, respectively, which were similar to those of AF IL-6. However, in univariate analyses, no differences in the AF levels of endoglin, endostatin, haptoglobin, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, kallistatin, lumican, p-selectin, TGFBI, and VDBP were found to be associated with SPTD at <34 weeks after cerclage placement.In women with acute CI, the AF levels of pentraxin 3, RAGE, and resistin could be useful novel biomarkers for predicting SPTD following emergency cerclage. However, the clinical utility of these new biomarkers should be validated in larger multicenter studies."

Additionally, we examined how these relationships varied based on their length of stay (LOS) and travel-group size (TGS). Results showed a significant positive effect of the perceived quality of medical care on all four components of the post-visit destination image. Except for enjoyment, all three components had a significant positive influence on revisit intentions. All the proposed relationships were supported for medical tourists with higher LOS and TGS. However, for medical tourists with low LOS, the perceived quality of medical care did not influence value for money. Furthermore, value for money and enjoyment did not significantly influence revisit intentions for medical tourists with low LOS and TGS."
https://openalex.org/W4280521878,"Capture-based aquaculture is now gaining much attention in Southeast Asia. This system was used to produce several fish species with social and economic implications, including the giant snakehead (Channa micropeltes). As wild harvesting of organisms for seed stock is one of main practices in capture-based aquaculture, abundance and distribution of the wild stock are essential for both environmental impact evaluation and stock management. Mark and recapture, visual observation and physical capture of target species are costly, ineffective, and labour intensive for fish surveys in several cases. Detection of target organisms using eDNA (environmental DNA) could be a good alternative as it has proved to be a non-invasive, rapid, and sensitive method for aquatic species monitoring and surveying. Here, we developed a TaqMan assay that targets the 16S region of giant snakehead DNA to amplify eDNA captured in water samples. 300 µl of water samples were collected from 15 sites located in the Chao Phraya River Basin (Ping, Wang, Yom, Nan, and Chao Phraya River) and filtered with 0.7 µm glass fibre membrane filter. Giant snakehead eDNA was detected in most tributaries (60%) with concentrations ranging from 74.0 copies/ml in Wang River sites to 7.4 copies/ml in Nan River sites. As intensification of capture-based aquaculture could lead to depleting of wild fish stocks, urgent management is needed. However, the existing conventional approaches for assessment of fish overexploitation, survey and monitoring have several limitations."

We aimed to fill this gap with this study to understand why persons with low back pain choose to attend the emergency department. Between July 4, 2017 and October 1, 2018, consecutive patients with a complaint of low back pain presenting to the University of Alberta Hospital emergency department were screened. Those enrolled completed a 13-item questionnaire to assess reasons and expectations related to their presentation. Demographics, acuity and disposition were obtained electronically. Factors associated with admission were examined in a logistic regression model. After screening 812 patients, 209 participants met the study criteria. The most common Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale score was 3 (73.2%). Overall, 37 (17.7%) received at least one consultation, 89.0% of participants were discharged home, 9.6% were admitted and 1.4% were transferred. Participants had a median pain intensity of 8/10 and a median daily functioning of 3/10. When asked, 64.6% attended for pain control while 44.5% stated ease of access. Most participants expected to obtain pain medication (67%) and advice (56%). Few attended because of cost savings (3.8%). After adjustment, only advanced age and ambulance arrival were significantly associated with admission. In conclusion, most low back pain patients came to the emergency department for pain control yet few were admitted and the majority did not receive a consultation. Timely alternatives for management of low back pain in the emergency department appear needed, yet are lacking."
https://openalex.org/W4280577825,"Systemic perturbations can drive a neuroimmune cascade after surgical trauma, including affecting the blood-brain barrier (BBB), activating microglia, and contributing to cognitive deficits such as delirium. Delirium superimposed on dementia (DSD) is a particularly debilitating complication that renders the brain further vulnerable to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, albeit these molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we have used an orthopedic model of tibial fracture/fixation in APPSwDI/mNos2-/- AD (CVN-AD) mice to investigate relevant pathogenetic mechanisms underlying DSD. We conducted the present study in 6-month-old CVN-AD mice, an age at which we speculated amyloid-β pathology had not saturated BBB and neuroimmune functioning. We found that URMC-099, our brain-penetrant anti-inflammatory neuroprotective drug, prevented inflammatory endothelial activation, breakdown of the BBB, synapse loss, and microglial activation in our DSD model. Taken together, our data link post-surgical endothelial activation, microglial MafB immunoreactivity, and synapse loss as key substrates for DSD, all of which can be prevented by URMC-099."
https://openalex.org/W4280638003,"The use of organoids has become increasingly popular recently due to their self-organizing abilities, which facilitate developmental and disease modeling. Various methods have been described to create embryoid bodies (EBs) generated from embryonic or pluripotent stem cells but with varying levels of differentiation success and producing organoids of variable size. Commercial ultra-low attachment (ULA) V-bottom well plates are frequently used to generate EBs. These plates are relatively expensive and not as widely available as standard concave well plates. Here, we describe a cost-effective and low labor-intensive method that creates homogeneous EBs at high yield in standard V- and U-bottom well plates by applying an anti-adherence solution to reduce surface attachment, followed by centrifugation to enhance cellular aggregation. We also explore the effect of different seeding densities, in the range of 1 to 11 ×103 cells per well, for the fabrication of neuroepithelial EBs. Our results show that the use of V-bottom well plates briefly treated with anti-adherent solution (for 5 min at room temperature) consistently yields functional neural EBs in the range of seeding densities from 5 to 11×103 cells per well. A brief post-seeding centrifugation step further enhances EB establishment. EBs fabricated using centrifugation exhibited lower variability in their final size than their non-centrifuged counterparts, and centrifugation also improved EB yield. The span of conditions for reliable EB production is narrower in U-bottom wells than in V-bottom wells (i.e., seeding densities between 7×103 and 11×103 and using a centrifugation step). We show that EBs generated by the protocols introduced here successfully developed into neural organoids and expressed the relevant markers associated with their lineages. We anticipate that the cost-effective and easily implemented protocols presented here will greatly facilitate the generation of EBs, thereby further democratizing the worldwide ability to conduct organoid-based research."

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing in CT requires cell culture with serial dilutions of antibiotics, which is laborious and for which there is no standardized testing methodology. One method to partly overcome these difficulties would be to use a genotypic resistance assay, however most current available assays do still require prior CT culture. In order to facilitate the assessment of genotypic resistance directly from clinical samples, without the need for prior culture, the aim of this study was to develop a CT specific PCR assay for the assessment of resistance associated mutations (RAMs) in the 23S rRNA gene, and to evaluate a sample of clinical cases in which CT PCR's remained positive during follow-up despite azithromycin treatment. Neither the in silico analysis nor the analytical specificity testing demonstrated clinically relevant cross-reactivity with other bacterial species. These results in conjunction with the analytical sensitivity demonstrating consistent CT 23S rRNA gene detection in the range of 10e3 IFU/mL, exemplify the assay's apt performance. Although no known macrolide RAMs were detected in the clinical cases, the described assay allows future culture independent macrolide RAM surveillance in CT, and increases accessibility for other laboratories to engage in screening."
https://openalex.org/W4229449490,"It is known that Rho GTPases control different aspects of the biology of skin stem cells (SSCs). However, little information is available on the role of their upstream regulators under normal and tumorigenic conditions in this process. To address this issue, we have used here mouse models in which the activity of guanosine nucleotide exchange factors of the Vav subfamily has been manipulated using both gain- and loss-of-function strategies. These experiments indicate that Vav2 and Vav3 regulate the number, functional status, and responsiveness of hair follicle bulge stem cells. This is linked to gene expression programs related to the reinforcement of the identity and the quiescent state of normal SSCs. By contrast, in the case of cancer stem cells, they promote transcriptomal programs associated with the identity, activation state, and cytoskeletal remodeling. These results underscore the role of these Rho exchange factors in the regulation of normal and tumor epidermal stem cells."

The aim of the study is to understand the utilization pattern of social health security schemes and community's perception of the social health security program.A descriptive cross-sectional mixed-method study was conducted among 300 households of Illam district who had enrolled in the social health security scheme. A multi-stage random sampling method was used. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data whereas focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted for qualitative data. Descriptive analysis, bivariate and multivariate analysis was done. FGDs were transcribed and thematic analysis was done.The utilization rate of social health security scheme was 88.7%. Factors associated with the utilization of program included: presence of under-five children and chronic illness in households, sex and age group. Focus group discussion revealed that people were aware of social health insurance and pleased with program implemented by government. However, the hospitals under the social health insurance were not able to meet their expectations.Although the utilization of social health security scheme was high, people were dissatisfied with the service provided by the hospital under the social health security scheme. Therefore, the social health insurance board should closely monitor the hospitals and develop a feedback mechanism from the users."
https://openalex.org/W4280507041,"Background Seasonal influenza leads to an increase in outpatient clinic visits. Timely, accurate, and affordable testing could facilitate improved treatment outcomes. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) provide results in as little as 15 minutes and are relatively inexpensive, but have reduced sensitivity when compared to RT-PCR. The contributions of multiple factors related to test performance are not well defined for ambulatory care settings. We assessed clinical and laboratory factors that may affect the sensitivity and specificity of Sofia Influenza A+B Fluorescence Immunoassay. Study design We performed a post-hoc assessment of surveillance data amassed over seven years from five primary care clinics. We analyzed 4,475 paired RIDT and RT-PCR results from specimens collected from patients presenting with respiratory symptoms and examined eleven potential factors with additional sub-categories that could affect RIDT sensitivity. Results In an unadjusted analysis, greater sensitivity was associated with the presence of an influenza-like illness (ILI), no other virus detected, no seasonal influenza vaccination, younger age, lower cycle threshold value, fewer days since illness onset, nasal discharge, stuffy nose, and fever. After adjustment, presence of an ILI, younger age, fewer days from onset, no co-detection, and presence of a nasal discharge maintained significance. Conclusion Clinical and laboratory factors may affect RIDT sensitivity. Identifying potential factors during point-of-care testing could aid clinicians in appropriately interpreting negative influenza RIDT results."
https://openalex.org/W4280609130,"Background This study investigated whether the timing of birth of the younger siblings was associated with the risk of the older siblings’ developmental vulnerability in early childhood. Methods Linkage of population-level birth registration, hospital, and perinatal datasets to Australian Early Development Census (AEDC) records (2009–2015), enabled follow-up of a cohort of 32,324 Western Australia born singletons. Children with scores &lt;10 th percentile on an individual AEDC domain (Physical Health and Wellbeing; Social Competence; Emotional Maturity; Language and Cognitive Skills (school-based); and Communication Skills and General Knowledge) were classified as developmentally vulnerable. Modified Poisson Regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) for associations between post-birth interpregnancy intervals (IPIs) and developmental vulnerability. Results Relative to post-birth IPIs of 18–23 months, post-birth IPIs of &lt;6 and 6–11 months were associated with an increased risk of children being classified as DV1 (aRR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.11–1.31) and DV2 (aRR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.15–1.49); and DV1 (aRR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03–1.17) and DV2 (aRR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.09–1.34), respectively. Post-birth IPIs of &lt;6 months were associated with an increased risk on four of the five AEDC domains. Post-birth IPIs of 48–60 months were associated with an increased risk of developmental vulnerability; however, the risk was statistically significant for DV1, DV2 and the domains of Emotional Maturity and Language and Cognitive Skills (school-based). Conclusions Developmental vulnerability was associated with having a closely spaced younger sibling (&lt;12 months post-birth IPIs). Optimising birth spacing should be further investigated as a potential means for improving child development outcomes."

Nevertheless, few data have been obtained on effective psychosocial interventions that could protect this group of cancer patients' psychological well-being. Therefore, this three-armed, parallel-group, double-blind, randomized control trial (RCT) aims to evaluate and compare the effects of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on positive psychology (such as posttraumatic growth [PTG], hope, and optimism), quality of life (QoL), and psychological complications (depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance) among newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients.This RCT will target newly diagnosed head and neck cancer patients who have been treated only with surgery or who have not yet received any treatment. In total, 120 patients who meet all of the study's inclusion criteria and none of its exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned into three groups-an ACT group, an MBSR group, and a treatment-as-usual control group-at a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Participants in the two intervention groups (the ACT and MBSR groups) will undergo an eight-week group intervention program. During this program, each intervention will comprise eight modules based on ACT and MBSR, respectively. Outcome assessments will be performed across a three-point timeline, including before the intervention (t0), immediately after the psychosocial intervention at eight weeks (t1), and six months after the intervention (t2). The primary outcome that will be assessed during this RCT is PTG. Meanwhile, the secondary outcomes that will be evaluated in this study are such as QoL, hope, optimism, depression, anxiety, and experiential avoidance.NCT04800419 (ClinicalTrials.gov).

https://openalex.org/W4229444132,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a pivotal role in the immune system and carcinogenesis. There is no research on TLR expression and association with survival among preoperatively treated pancreatic cancer patients. We studied the expression intensity and prognostic value of TLRs in pancreatic cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and compared the results to patients undergoing upfront surgery (US).Between 2000 and 2015, 71 borderline resectable patients were treated with NAT and surgery and 145 resectable patients underwent upfront surgery at Helsinki University Hospital, Finland. We immunostained TLRs 1-5, 7, and 9 on sections of tissue-microarray. We classified TLR expression as 0 (negative), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (strong) and divided into high (2-3) and low (0-1) expression for statistical purposes.Among TLRs 1, 3, and 9 (TLR1 81% vs 70%, p = 0.008; TLR3 92% vs 68%, p = 0.001; TLR9 cytoplasmic 83% vs 42%, p<0.001; TLR9 membranous 53% vs 25%, p = 0.002) NAT patients exhibited a higher immunopositivity score more frequently than patients undergoing upfront surgery. Among NAT patients, a high expression of TLR1 [Hazards ratio (HR) 0.48, p<0.05] associated with a longer postoperative survival, whereas among US patients, high expression of TLR5 (HR 0.64, p<0.05), TLR7 (HR 0.59, p<0.01, and both TLR7 and TLR9 (HR 0.5, p<0.01) predicted a favorable postoperative outcome in separate analysis adjusted for background variables.We found higher immunopositive intensities among TLRs 1, 3, and 9 in NAT patients.

https://openalex.org/W4229451321,"Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) is the most severe viral disease for citrus production. Many strains of CTV have been characterized and their symptomology widely varies, ranging from asymptomatic or mild infections to severe symptomology that results in substantial yield loss or host death. The capacity of the different CTV strains to affect the biochemistry of different citrus species has remained largely unstudied, despite that associated metabolomic shifts would be relevant toward symptom development. Thus, amino acid, sugar, phenolic, and terpenoid levels were assessed in leaves of healthy and CTV-infected grapefruit, lemon, mandarin, and two different sweet orange cultivars. Both mild [VT-negative (VT-)] and severe [VT-positive (VT+)] CTV genotype strains were utilized. When looking at overall totals of these metabolite classes, only amino acid levels were significantly increased by infection of citrus with severe CTV strains, relative to mild CTV strains or healthy plants. No significant trends of CTV infection on summed amounts of all sugar, phenolic, or terpenoid compounds were observed. However, individual compound levels were affected by CTV infections. Subsequent canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) that utilized profiles of individual amino acids, terpenoids, or phenolics successfully distinguished leaf samples to specific citrus varieties and identified infection status with good accuracy. Collectively, this study reveals biochemical patterns associated with severity of CTV infections that can potentially be utilized to help identify in-field CTV infections of economic relevance."
https://openalex.org/W4229454070,"With the recent occurrence of locally transmitted Aedes-borne viruses in the continental United States and Europe, and a lack of effective vaccines, new approaches to control Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus are needed. In sub-tropical urban settings in the US, Ae. albopictus is a dominant nuisance and arbovirus vector species. Unfortunately, the vector control toolbox against Ae. albopictus is not as well developed as for Ae. aegypti. Here, we evaluate the efficacy, longevity, and range of protectiveness of a novel passive metofluthrin emanator (10% active ingredient in a polyethylene mesh) against Ae. albopictus indoors and outdoors.Four studies were conducted comparing the presence of the metofluthrin emanator to a control lacking emanator with interest in quantifying efficacy by human landing counts. Studies evaluated the effect of an emanator at varying distances from one or more human volunteers indoors and outdoors. Efficacy of emanators over time since activation was also evaluated.Mixed-effects models determined that sitting in close proximity to an emanator reduced landings by 89.5% outdoors and by 74.6% indoors. The emanator was determined protective when located immediately next to a human volunteer outdoors but not uniformly protective when located further away. The emanator was protective at all tested distances from the device indoors. Mortality of mosquitoes exposed to metofluthrin emanators was ~2x higher than those who were not exposed in indoor conditions. Finally, a Generalized Additive Model determined that emanators used continuously outdoors lost their effect after 2.5 weeks and stopped inducing paralysis in mosquitoes after 3.8 weeks of use.We show strong and lasting efficacy of 10% metofluthrin emanators against field Ae. albopictus both in indoor and outdoor conditions. Metofluthrin emanators can protect people from Ae. albopictus bites, representing a viable option for reducing human-mosquito contacts at home and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W4229459545,"The red color in radish taproots is an important quality index and is mainly affected by anthocyanins. However, the metabolite components and gene expression underlying dark red taproot color formation in radish remain elusive. In this study, the metabolites and gene expression patterns affecting anthocyanin biosynthesis were monitored in the dark red taproots. Comparative analysis of anthocyanin metabolites between dark red taproots and white taproots indicated that pelargonin and pelargonidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside were the most promising dark red pigments responsible for the coloration of the taproots. Transcriptomic analysis of gene expression between dark red taproots and white taproots revealed that most of genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated in dark red taproots. In particular, RsCHS and RsDFR were the two most up-regulated genes in the dark red taproots. Moreover, the higher coexpression of two R2R3-Myb transcription factors, RsMYB1 and RsMYB2, may contribute to dark red color formation. Our work documents metabolomic and transcriptomic changes related to the dark red color formation in taproots radish and provides valuable data for anthocyanin-rich radish breeding."
https://openalex.org/W4280523661,"The wolverine ( Gulo gulo ) in Finland has undergone significant population declines in the past. Since major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes encode proteins involved in pathogen recognition, the diversity of these genes provides insights into the immunological fitness of regional populations. We sequenced 862 amplicons (242 bp) of MHC class II DRB exon 2 from 32 Finnish wolverines and identified 11 functional alleles and three pseudogenes. A molecular phylogenetic analysis indicated trans-species polymorphism, and PAML and MEME analyses indicated positive selection, suggesting that the Finnish wolverine DRB genes have evolved under balancing and positive selection. In contrast to DRB gene analyses in other species, allele frequencies in the Finnish wolverines clearly indicated the existence of two regional subpopulations, congruent with previous studies based on neutral genetic markers. In the Finnish wolverine, rapid population declines in the past have promoted genetic drift, resulting in a lower genetic diversity of DRB loci, including fewer alleles and positively selected sites, than other mustelid species analyzed previously. Our data suggest that the MHC region in the Finnish wolverine population was likely affected by a recent bottleneck."

Significant rates of comorbidity and familial risk for kidney disease may limit this approach in the local context; there is currently limited data describing living donation in Africa.We assessed reasons for non-donation and outcomes following donation in a cohort of 1208 ethnically diverse potential living donors evaluated over a 32-year period at a single transplant centre in South Africa.Medical contraindications were the commonest reason for donor exclusion. Black donors were more frequently excluded (52.1% vs. 39.3%; p<0.001), particularly for medical contraindications (44% vs. 35%; p<0.001); 298 donors proceeded to donor nephrectomy (24.7%). Although no donor required kidney replacement therapy, an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 was recorded in 27% of donors at a median follow-up of 3.7 years, new onset albuminuria >300 mg/day was observed in 4%, and 12.8% developed new-onset hypertension.

https://openalex.org/W4280599303,"Older adults with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have increased risks of major cardiovascular events and hospitalization. Metabolic comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia, are common risk factors for these unfavorable health events. This study aimed to determine how multiple metabolic comorbidities affect the risk of adverse health outcomes in older adults with PAD. A retrospective cohort study was adopted using administrative claim data from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service Agency. The study sample included 3,122 older adults (≥ 65 years old) with at least one PAD diagnosis in an inpatient setting from 2011 to 2013 and who had at least one follow-up visit after hospitalization by 2018. The three metabolic comorbidities were defined as having at least two diagnostic claims or one prescription per year of anti-hypertensive, anti-diabetic, or anti-dyslipidemic medications for the corresponding diagnosis. The outcome variables included major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and major adverse limb events (MALE). Kaplan-Meier survival curves demonstrated that PAD patients with more metabolic comorbidities had shorter MACE-free and MALE-free periods. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards analyses suggested significant additive effects of multiple metabolic comorbidities on increased risks of MACE and MALE among older adults with PAD. Lower socioeconomic status and non-metabolic comorbidities also increased the risk of MACE. Male sex, being young-old (65–74 years), and a higher proportion of inpatient claims increased the risk of MALE. The findings of this study suggest the need for a comprehensive care program for older adults with PAD and metabolic comorbidities. In addition, the healthcare utilization pattern should be considered when designing preventive care for older patients with comorbidities to manage PAD at an earlier stage."
https://openalex.org/W4229083152,"Arp2/3 complex nucleates branched actin filaments that drive processes like endocytosis and lamellipodial protrusion. WISH/DIP/SPIN90 (WDS) proteins form a class of Arp2/3 complex activators or nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) that, unlike WASP family NPFs, activate Arp2/3 complex without requiring preformed actin filaments. Therefore, activation of Arp2/3 complex by WDS proteins is thought to produce the initial actin filaments that seed branching nucleation by WASP-bound Arp2/3 complexes. However, whether activation of Arp2/3 complex by WDS proteins is important for the initiation of branched actin assembly in cells has not been directly tested. Here, we used structure-based point mutations of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe WDS protein Dip1 to test the importance of its Arp2/3-activating activity in cells. Six of thirteen Dip1 mutants caused severe defects in Arp2/3 complex activation in vitro, and we found a strong correlation between the ability of mutants to activate Arp2/3 complex and to rescue endocytic actin assembly defects caused by deleting Dip1. These data support a model in which Dip1 activates Arp2/3 complex to produce actin filaments that initiate branched actin assembly at endocytic sites. Dip1 mutants that synergized with WASP in activating Arp2/3 complex in vitro showed milder defects in cells compared to those that did not, suggesting that in cells the two NPFs may coactivate Arp2/3 complex to initiate actin assembly. Finally, the mutational data reveal important complementary electrostatic contacts at the Dip1-Arp2/3 complex interface and corroborate the previously proposed wedge model, which describes how Dip1 binding triggers structural changes that activate Arp2/3 complex."

Our findings show that the heterogeneous SPS measures restrict the intensive margin and extensive margin, but significantly promote the product quality-even with no significant effect on price index. Conditional on quality upgrading, the heterogeneous SPS measures decrease the extent of quality upgrading. On one hand, because of cross-country differences in SPS standards, standards from developed countries have less effective trade effect on China's agri-products export quality upgrading; On the other hand, because of cross-firm differences in the ability to deal with SPS standards, the laggards in China have the higher probability to switch to lower entrance barrier countries. Therefore, it is possible for China to trap in the low-quality agricultural growth in the long term."

Method This was a retrospective cohort study of adults with mental health diagnoses using data from the Health Databank Collaborative (HDC), a primary care-hospital linked database in Toronto. Data were included up to March 31 st 2019. Negative binomial and logistic regression were used to evaluate associations between health care utilization and various patient characteristics and mental health diagnoses. Results 28,482 patients age 18 or older were included. The adjusted odds of at least one mental health diagnosis were higher among younger patients (18–30 years vs. 81+years aOR = 1.87; 95% CI:1.68–2.08) and among female patients (aOR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.27–1.42). Patients with one or more mental health diagnoses had higher adjusted rates of hospital visits compared to those without any mental health diagnosis including addiction (aRR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.58–1.91) and anxiety (aRR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.23–1.32). 14.5% of patients with a psychiatric diagnosis were referred to the hospital for specialized psychiatric services, and 38% of patients referred were eventually seen in consultation. The median wait time from the date of referral to the date of consultation was 133 days. Conclusions In this community, individuals with mental health diagnoses accessed primary and hospital-based health care at greater rates than those without mental health diagnoses. Wait times for specialized psychiatric care were long and most patients who were referred did not have a consultation. Information about services for patients with mental health conditions can be used to plan and monitor more integrated care across sectors, and ultimately improve outcomes."

Therefore, this paper takes the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2016 as the research sample, on the basis of using DEA Global-Malmquist index to measure the innovation efficiency of high-tech industries, it constructs three spatial weight matrices, by including spatial geography, spatial economic geography nesting and innovation, and then it uses Spatial Durbin Model to empirically analyze the effect of innovation efficiency of high-tech industry on CO2 emissions in China from spatial perspective. The results indicate: firstly, in China, CO2 emissions gradually increase from 2006 to 2012, however, some provinces have declined after 2012. And CO2 emissions present a descending trend from eastern coastal area to central and western region. Secondly, affected by ""warning effect"", CO2 emissions show a significant negative spatial spillover effect. Thirdly, the overall level of innovation efficiency of high-tech industries in China is not high, and its impact on CO2 emissions is not a simple linear relationship, but shows an ""inverted N-shaped"" curvilinear relation, and its decomposition index EC and TC also have similar characteristics.

Since gag is a highly immunodominant HIV-1 protein, we performed a comparative analysis of the CRF01_AE gag protein's time-dependent changes and evolution. A total of 3105 HIV-1 CRF01_AE gag sequences representing 17 countries from the timeline 1990-2017 were obtained. The sequences' phylogenetic relationship and epidemic dynamics were analyzed through a Maximum Likelihood tree and Bayesian Skyline plot, respectively. Genomic variability was measured through Shannon entropy and time-dependent immunoevolution was analyzed using changes in proteasomal degradation pattern, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, and Human leukocyte antigens (HLA) restriction profile. The most recent common ancestor of the HIV CRF01_AE epidemic was estimated to be 1974±1. A period of exponential growth in effective population size began in 1982, fluctuated, and then stabilized in 1999. Genetic variability (entropy) consistently increased, however, epitope variability remained comparable; the highest number of novel CTL epitopes were present in 1995-1999, which were lost over time. The spread of the HIV-1 CRF01_AE epidemic is predominant in countries within Asia.

https://openalex.org/W4280632681,"Development of automated analysis tools for “single ion channel” recording is hampered by the lack of available training data. For machine learning based tools, very large training sets are necessary with sample-by-sample point labelled data (e.g., 1 sample point every 100microsecond). In an experimental context, such data are labelled with human supervision, and whilst this is feasible for simple experimental analysis, it is infeasible to generate the enormous datasets that would be necessary for a big data approach using hand crafting. In this work we aimed to develop methods to generate simulated ion channel data that is free from assumptions and prior knowledge of noise and underlying hidden Markov models. We successfully leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to build an end-to-end pipeline for generating an unlimited amount of labelled training data from a small, annotated ion channel “seed” record, and this needs no prior knowledge of theoretical dynamical ion channel properties. Our method utilises 2D CNNs to maintain the synchronised temporal relationship between the raw and idealised record. We demonstrate the applicability of the method with 5 different data sources and show authenticity with t-SNE and UMAP projection comparisons between real and synthetic data. The model would be easily extendable to other time series data requiring parallel labelling, such as labelled ECG signals or raw nanopore sequencing data."
