https://openalex.org/W3199862549,"Microglia are the CNS resident immune cells that react to misfolded proteins through pattern recognition receptor ligation and activation of inflammatory pathways. Here, we studied how microglia handle and cope with α-synuclein (α-syn) fibrils and their clearance. We found that microglia exposed to α-syn establish a cellular network through the formation of F-actin-dependent intercellular connections, which transfer α-syn from overloaded microglia to neighboring naive microglia where the α-syn cargo got rapidly and effectively degraded. Lowering the α-syn burden attenuated the inflammatory profile of microglia and improved their survival. This degradation strategy was compromised in cells carrying the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. We confirmed the intercellular transfer of α-syn assemblies in microglia using organotypic slice cultures, 2-photon microscopy, and neuropathology of patients. Together, these data identify a mechanism by which microglia create an ""on-demand"" functional network in order to improve pathogenic α-syn clearance."
https://openalex.org/W3199457517,"Background Qualitative olfactory (smell) dysfunctions are a common side effect of post-viral illness and known to impact quality of life and health status. Evidence is emerging that taste and smell loss are common symptoms of Covid-19 that may emerge and persist long after initial infection. The aim of the present study was to document the impact of post Covid-19 alterations to taste and smell. Methods We conducted exploratory thematic analysis of user-generated text from 9000 users of the AbScent Covid-19 Smell and Taste Loss moderated Facebook support group from March 24 to 30th September 2020. Results Participants reported difficulty explaining and managing an altered sense of taste and smell; a lack of interpersonal and professional explanation or support; altered eating; appetite loss, weight change; loss of pleasure in food, eating and social engagement; altered intimacy and an altered relationship to self and others. Conclusions Our findings suggest altered taste and smell with Covid-19 may lead to severe disruption to daily living that impacts on psychological well-being, physical health, relationships and sense of self. More specifically, participants reported impacts that related to reduced desire and ability to eat and prepare food; weight gain, weight loss and nutritional insufficiency; emotional wellbeing; professional practice; intimacy and social bonding; and the disruption of people’s sense of reality and themselves. Our findings should inform further research and suggest areas for the training, assessment and treatment practices of health care professionals working with long Covid."
https://openalex.org/W3199344857,"Abstract Cholecystokinin A receptor (CCK A R) belongs to family A G-protein-coupled receptors and regulates nutrient homeostasis upon stimulation by cholecystokinin (CCK). It is an attractive drug target for gastrointestinal and metabolic diseases. One distinguishing feature of CCK A R is its ability to interact with a sulfated ligand and to couple with divergent G-protein subtypes, including G s , G i and G q . However, the basis for G-protein coupling promiscuity and ligand recognition by CCK A R remains unknown. Here, we present three cryo-electron microscopy structures of sulfated CCK-8-activated CCK A R in complex with G s , G i and G q heterotrimers, respectively. CCK A R presents a similar conformation in the three structures, whereas conformational differences in the ‘wavy hook’ of the Gα subunits and ICL3 of the receptor serve as determinants in G-protein coupling selectivity. Our findings provide a framework for understanding G-protein coupling promiscuity by CCK A R and uncover the mechanism of receptor recognition by sulfated CCK-8."
https://openalex.org/W3200428837,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often caused by pathogenic variants in sarcomeric genes and characterized by left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis and increased risk of heart failure and arrhythmias. There are no existing therapies to modify disease progression. In this study, we conducted a multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of the angiotensin II receptor blocker valsartan in attenuating disease evolution in early HCM. In total, 178 participants with early-stage sarcomeric HCM were randomized (1:1) to receive valsartan (320 mg daily in adults; 80-160 mg daily in children) or placebo for 2 years ( NCT01912534 ). Standardized changes from baseline to year 2 in LV wall thickness, mass and volumes; left atrial volume; tissue Doppler diastolic and systolic velocities; and serum levels of high-sensitivity troponin T and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic protein were integrated into a single composite z-score as the primary outcome. Valsartan (n = 88) improved cardiac structure and function compared to placebo (n = 90), as reflected by an increase in the composite z-score (between-group difference +0.231, 95% confidence interval (+0.098, +0.364); P = 0.001), which met the primary endpoint of the study. Treatment was well-tolerated. These results indicate a key opportunity to attenuate disease progression in early-stage sarcomeric HCM with an accessible and safe medication."
https://openalex.org/W3199831722,"Glycine receptors (GlyRs) are pentameric, ‘Cys-loop’ receptors that form chloride-permeable channels and mediate fast inhibitory signalling throughout the central nervous system1,2. In the spinal cord and brainstem, GlyRs regulate locomotion and cause movement disorders when mutated2,3. However, the stoichiometry of native GlyRs and the mechanism by which they are assembled remain unclear, despite extensive investigation4–8. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of native GlyRs from pig spinal cord and brainstem, revealing structural insights into heteromeric receptors and their predominant subunit stoichiometry of 4α:1β. Within the heteromeric pentamer, the β(+)–α(−) interface adopts a structure that is distinct from the α(+)–α(−) and α(+)–β(−) interfaces. Furthermore, the β-subunit contains a unique phenylalanine residue that resides within the pore and disrupts the canonical picrotoxin site. These results explain why inclusion of the β-subunit breaks receptor symmetry and alters ion channel pharmacology. We also find incomplete receptor complexes and, by elucidating their structures, reveal the architectures of partially assembled α-trimers and α-tetramers. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of pig glycine receptors indicate that they are predominantly assembled with 4α:1β stoichiometry via α-homotrimer and homotetramer intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W3201641252,"Epitranscriptomic RNA modifications can regulate RNA activity; however, there remains a major gap in our understanding of the RNA chemistry present in biological systems. Here we develop RNA-mediated activity-based protein profiling (RNABPP), a chemoproteomic strategy that relies on metabolic RNA labeling, mRNA interactome capture and quantitative proteomics, to investigate RNA-modifying enzymes in human cells. RNABPP with 5-fluoropyrimidines allowed us to profile 5-methylcytidine (m5C) and 5-methyluridine (m5U) methyltransferases. Further, we uncover a new mechanism-based crosslink between 5-fluorouridine (5-FUrd)-modified RNA and the dihydrouridine synthase (DUS) homolog DUS3L. We investigate the mechanism of crosslinking and use quantitative nucleoside liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and 5-FUrd-based crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) sequencing to map DUS3L-dependent dihydrouridine (DHU) modifications across the transcriptome. Finally, we show that DUS3L-knockout (KO) cells have compromised protein translation rates and impaired cellular proliferation. Taken together, our work provides a general approach for profiling RNA-modifying enzyme activity in living cells and reveals new pathways for epitranscriptomic RNA regulation."

https://openalex.org/W3199727813,"We present an interpretable machine learning algorithm called ‘eARDS’ for predicting ARDS in an ICU population comprising COVID-19 patients, up to 12-hours before satisfying the Berlin clinical criteria. The analysis was conducted on data collected from the Intensive care units (ICU) at Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA and University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN and the Cerner ® Health Facts Deidentified Database, a multi-site COVID-19 EMR database. The participants in the analysis consisted of adults over 18 years of age. Clinical data from 35,804 patients who developed ARDS and controls were used to generate predictive models that identify risk for ARDS onset up to 12-hours before satisfying the Berlin criteria. We identified salient features from the electronic medical record that predicted respiratory failure among this population. The machine learning algorithm which provided the best performance exhibited AUROC of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.88–0.90), sensitivity of 0.77 (95% CI = 0.75–0.78), specificity 0.85 (95% CI = 085–0.86). Validation performance across two separate health systems (comprising 899 COVID-19 patients) exhibited AUROC of 0.82 (0.81–0.83) and 0.89 (0.87, 0.90). Important features for prediction of ARDS included minimum oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), standard deviation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), O 2 flow, and maximum respiratory rate over an observational window of 16-hours. Analyzing the performance of the model across various cohorts indicates that the model performed best among a younger age group (18–40) (AUROC = 0.93 [0.92–0.94]), compared to an older age group (80+) (AUROC = 0.81 [0.81–0.82]). The model performance was comparable on both male and female groups, but performed significantly better on the severe ARDS group compared to the mild and moderate groups. The eARDS system demonstrated robust performance for predicting COVID19 patients who developed ARDS at least 12-hours before the Berlin clinical criteria, across two independent health systems."
https://openalex.org/W3199792723,"No previous study assessed the combined effect of olive pruning residues (OLPR) and spent coffee grounds (SCG) on P . ostreatus production and nutritional value. The aim of this study was to determine the capacity of P . ostreatus to degrade lignocellulosic nature of combined OLPR and SCG as well as their resultant nutrient composition. A complete randomized design was adopted with five treatments: S1:100%wheat straw (WS) (control), S2:33%WS+33%SCG+33%OLPR,S3:66%WS+17%SCG+17%OLPR,S4:17%WS+66%SCG+17%OLPR, and S5:17%WS+17%SCG+66%OLPR, and ten replicates per treatment. Substrate’s and mushroom’s composition were analyzed on chemical scale, including fatty acids and heavy metals profiles, following international standards. Only S1, S2, and S3 were productive, with comparable biological yield, economical yield, and biological efficiency. Organic matter loss decreased with increasing proportions of OLPR and SCG. Percentage lignin loss was higher in S1 than in S2 and S3 (53.51, 26.25, and 46.15% respectively). Mushrooms of S3 had some enhanced nutritional attributes compared to control: decrease in fat, increase in protein, increase in monounsaturated fatty acids, and lower zinc accumulation. Lead was less accumulated in S2 than S1 mushrooms. Sodium content of mushroom decreased in S2 and S3. The latter substrates yielded mushrooms with lower polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and higher saturated fatty acids (SFA) contents. All mushrooms had a valuable PUFA/SFA. This study suggests using OLPR and SCG in low proportions as nutritional supplements to the commercial wheat straw."
https://openalex.org/W3199838334,"Unlike olfaction, taste, touch, vision, and proprioception, which are widespread across animal phyla, hearing is found only in vertebrates and some arthropods. The vast majority of invertebrate species are thus considered insensitive to sound. Here, we challenge this conventional view by showing that the earless nematode C. elegans senses airborne sound at frequencies reaching the kHz range. Sound vibrates C. elegans skin, which acts as a pressure-to-displacement transducer similar to vertebrate eardrum, activates sound-sensitive FLP/PVD neurons attached to the skin, and evokes phonotaxis behavior. We identified two nAChRs that transduce sound signals independently of ACh, revealing an unexpected function of nAChRs in mechanosensation. Thus, the ability to sense airborne sound is not restricted to vertebrates and arthropods as previously thought, and might have evolved multiple times independently in the animal kingdom, suggesting convergent evolution. Our studies also demonstrate that animals without ears may not be presumed to be sound insensitive."
https://openalex.org/W3199699026,"Altered transcription is a cardinal feature of acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, exactly how mutations synergize to remodel the epigenetic landscape and rewire three-dimensional DNA topology is unknown. Here, we apply an integrated genomic approach to a murine allelic series that models the two most common mutations in AML: Flt3-ITD and Npm1c. We then deconvolute the contribution of each mutation to alterations of the epigenetic landscape and genome organization, and infer how mutations synergize in the induction of AML. Our studies demonstrate that Flt3-ITD signals to chromatin to alter the epigenetic environment and synergizes with mutations in Npm1c to alter gene expression and drive leukemia induction. These analyses also allow the identification of long-range cis-regulatory circuits, including a previously unknown superenhancer of Hoxa locus, as well as larger and more detailed gene-regulatory networks, driven by transcription factors including PU.1 and IRF8, whose importance we demonstrate through perturbation of network members. Mice bearing mutations in Flt3-ITD and Npm1c, which are commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia, are used to characterize the cooperative effects of these cancer drivers on the cellular epigenome and three-dimensional genome conformation during tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W3200716255,"Reducing neuronal size results in less membrane and therefore lower input conductance. Smaller neurons are thus more excitable, as seen in their responses to somatic current injections. However, the impact of a neuron's size and shape on its voltage responses to dendritic synaptic activation is much less understood. Here we use analytical cable theory to predict voltage responses to distributed synaptic inputs in unbranched cables, showing that these are entirely independent of dendritic length. For a given synaptic density, neuronal responses depend only on the average dendritic diameter and intrinsic conductivity. This remains valid for a wide range of morphologies irrespective of their arborization complexity. Spiking models indicate that morphology-invariant numbers of spikes approximate the percentage of active synapses. In contrast to spike rate, spike times do depend on dendrite morphology. In summary, neuronal excitability in response to distributed synaptic inputs is largely unaffected by dendrite length or complexity."
https://openalex.org/W3199988435,"Abstract Neuroblastoma (NB) has a low frequency of recurrent mutations compared to other cancers, which hinders the development of targeted therapies and novel risk stratification strategies. Multikinase inhibitors have shown potential in treating high-risk NB, but their efficacy is likely impaired by the cancer cells’ ability to adapt to these drugs through the employment of alternative signaling pathways. Based on the expression of 48 growth factor-related genes in 1189 NB tumors, we have developed a model for NB patient survival prediction. This model discriminates between stage 4 NB tumors with favorable outcomes (&gt;80% overall survival) and very poor outcomes (&lt;10%) independently from MYCN-amplification status. Using signaling pathway analysis and gene set enrichment methods in 60 NB patients with known therapy response, we identified signaling pathways, including EPO, NGF, and HGF, upregulated in patients with no or partial response. In a therapeutic setting, we showed that among six selected growth factors, EPO, and NGF showed the most pronounced protective effects in vitro against several promising anti-NB multikinase inhibitors: imatinib, dasatinib, crizotinib, cabozantinib, and axitinib. Mechanistically kinase inhibitors potentiated NB cells to stronger ERK activation by EPO and NGF. The protective action of these growth factors strongly correlated with ERK activation and was ERK-dependent. ERK inhibitors combined with anticancer drugs, especially with dasatinib, showed a synergistic effect on NB cell death. Consideration of growth factor signaling activity benefits NB outcome prediction and tailoring therapy regimens to treat NB."
https://openalex.org/W3199402736,"Complete blockade of the HER2 protein itself and HER signaling network is critical to achieving effective HER2-targeted therapies. Despite the success of HER2-targeted therapies, the diseases will relapse in a significant fraction of patients with HER2+ breast cancers. How to improve the therapeutic efficacy of existing HER2-targeted agents remains an unmet clinical need. Here, we uncover a role of Melatonin in diminishing HER2-mediated signaling by destruction of HER2 protein. Mechanistically, Melatonin treatment attenuated the protective effect of the HSP90 chaperone complex on its client protein HER2, triggering ubiquitylation and subsequent endocytic lysosomal degradation of HER2. The inhibitory effect of Melatonin on HER2 signaling substantially enhanced the cytotoxic effects of the pan-HER inhibitor Neratinib in HER2+ breast cancer cells. Lastly, we demonstrate that dual inhibition of HER2 by combined use of Melatonin and Neratinib effectively blocked the growth of HER2+ breast tumor xenografts in vivo. Our findings shed light on the potential use of Melatonin in a novel dual HER2 blockade strategy for HER2+ breast cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3201099743,"Laws not only affect behavior due to changes in material payoffs, but they may also change the perception individuals have of social norms, either by shifting them directly or by providing information on these norms. Using detailed daily survey data and exploiting the introduction of lockdown measures in the UK in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis, we provide causal evidence that the law drastically changed the perception of the norms regarding social distancing behaviors. We show that this effect of laws on perceived norms is mostly driven by an informational channel and that the intervention made perceptions of social norms converge to the actual prevalent norm."
https://openalex.org/W3201221109,"The structured reactivation of hippocampal neuronal ensembles during fast synchronous oscillatory events, termed sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), has been suggested to play a crucial role in the storage and use of memory. Activity in both the CA2 and CA3 subregions can precede this population activity in CA1, and chronic inhibition of either region alters SWR oscillations. However, the precise contribution of CA2 to the oscillation, as well as to the reactivation of CA1 neurons within it, remains unclear. Here, we employ chemogenetics to transiently silence CA2 pyramidal cells in mice, and we observe that although SWRs still occur, the reactivation of CA1 pyramidal cell ensembles within the events lose both temporal and informational precision. These observations suggest that CA2 activity contributes to the fidelity of experience-dependent hippocampal replay."
https://openalex.org/W3163242954,"Curiosity is pervasive in our everyday lives, but we know little about the factors that contribute to this drive. In the current study, we assessed whether curiosity about uncertain outcomes is modulated by the valence of the information, i.e. whether the information is good or bad news. Using a lottery task in which outcome uncertainty, expected value and outcome valence (gain versus loss) were manipulated independently, we found that curiosity is overall higher for gains compared with losses and that curiosity increased with increasing outcome uncertainty for both gains and losses. These effects of uncertainty and valence did not interact, indicating that the motivation to reduce uncertainty and the motivation to maximize positive information represent separate, independent drives."
https://openalex.org/W3199044073,"Primordial germ cells (PGCs) are common ancestors of all germline cells. However, mechanistic understanding of how PGC specification occurs is limited. Here, we identified transcription factor CP2-like 1 (Tfcp2l1), an important pluripotency factor, as a pivotal factor for PGC-like cell (PGCLC) specification. High-throughput sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that Tfcp2l1 expression is gradually increased during mouse and human epiblast differentiation into PGCLCs in vivo and in vitro. Consequently, overexpression of Tfcp2l1 can enhance the specification efficiency even without inductive cytokines in mouse epiblast-like cells derived from embryonic stem cells, while knockdown of Tfcp2l1 significantly inhibits PGCLC generation. Mechanistic studies revealed that Tfcp2l1 exerts its function partially through the direct induction of PR domain zinc finger protein 14, a key PGC marker, as downregulation of the PR domain zinc finger protein 14 transcript can impair the ability of Tfcp2l1 to direct PGCLC commitment. Importantly, we finally demonstrated that the crucial role of the human homolog Tfcp2l1 in promoting PGCLC specification is conserved in human pluripotent stem cells. Together, our data uncover a novel function of Tfcp2l1 in PGCLC fate determination and facilitate a better understanding of germ cell development."

https://openalex.org/W3199277769,"In pan Pamir Plateau countries, Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) has brought huge losses to the livestock industry and threaten the endangered wildlife. In unknown regions, revealing PPRV transmission among countries is the premise of effective prevention and control, therefore calls for quantified monitoring on disease communication among countries. In this paper, a MaxEnt model was built for the first time to predict the PPR risk within the research area. The least cost path (LCP) for PPR transboundary communication were calculated and referred to as the maximum available paths (MAP). The results show that there are many places with high-risk in the research area, and the domestic risk in China is lower than that in foreign countries and is mainly determined by human activities. Five LCPs representing corridors among Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, India and China were obtained. This study proves for the first time that there is the possibility of cross-border transmission of diseases by wild and domestic animals. In the future, it will play an important role in monitoring the PPR epidemic and blocking-up its cross-border transmission."
https://openalex.org/W3198963185,"Abstract ISG15 is an ubiquitin-like modifier that is associated with reduced survival rates in breast cancer patients. The mechanism by which ISG15 achieves this however remains elusive. We demonstrate that modification of Rab GDP-Dissociation Inhibitor Beta (GDI2) by ISG15 (ISGylation) alters endocytic recycling of the EGF receptor (EGFR) in non-interferon stimulated cells using CRISPR-knock out models for ISGylation. By regulating EGFR trafficking, ISGylation enhances EGFR recycling and sustains Akt-signalling. We further show that Akt signalling positively correlates with levels of ISG15 and its E2-ligase in basal breast cancer cohorts, confirming the link between ISGylation and Akt signalling in human tumours. Persistent and enhanced Akt activation explains the more aggressive tumour behaviour observed in human breast cancers. We show that ISGylation can act as a driver of tumour progression rather than merely being a bystander."
https://openalex.org/W3199277514,"The Coronovirus Disease 2019 –(COVID-19) pandemic had a significant impact on the health care system and medical staff around the world. The orthopedic units were also subject to new restrictions and regulations. Therefore, the aim of our research was to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic affected orthopedic wards in the last year in Poland. We created an online survey, which was sent to 273 members of the Polish Society of Orthopedics and Traumatology. The survey contained 51 questions and was divided into main sections: Preparedness, Training, Stress, Reduction, Awareness. A total of 80 responses to the survey were obtained. In Preparedness section the vast majority of respondents (90%) replied, that they used personal protective equipment during the pandemic, however only 50% of the respondents indicated that their facility received a sufficient amount of personal protective equipment. Most of the respondents indicated that the pandemic negatively affected the quality of training of future orthopedists (69.4%) and that pandemic has had a negative impact on their operating skills (66,7%). In Reduction section most of the doctors indicated that the number of patients hospitalized in their departments decreased by 20–60% (61,2% respondents), while the number of operations performed decreased by 60–100% (60% respondents). The negative impact of pandemic on education was noticeable especially in the group of young orthopedic surgeons: 0–5 years of work experience (p = 0,029). Among the respondents, the level of stress increased over the last year from 4.8 to 6.9 (p &lt;0.001). The greatest increase in the level of stress was observed among orthopedists working in country hospitals (p = 0,03). In section Awareness 36,3% of respondents feel well or very well informed about the latest Covid-19 regulations. In addition, most doctors (82.6%) believe that the Polish health care system was not well prepared to fight the pandemic and that the regulations applied so far are not sufficient to effectively fight the pandemic (66.2%). The COVID-19 pandemic has impact on orthopedics departments in Poland and negatively affected the quality of training of orthopedic surgeons and the level of stress."
https://openalex.org/W3200216184,"Background &amp; aim We investigated the combination of rapid antigen detection (RAD) and RT-qPCR assays in a stepwise procedure to optimize the detection of COVID-19. Methods From August 2020 to November 2020, 43,399 patients were screened in our laboratory for COVID-19 diagnostic by RT-qPCR using nasopharyngeal swab. Overall, 4,691 of the 43,399 were found to be positive, and 200 were retrieved for RAD testing allowing comparison of diagnostic accuracy between RAD and RT-qPCR. Cycle threshold (Ct) and time from symptoms onset (TSO) were included as covariates. Results The overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR-, and LR+ of RAD compared with RT-qPCR were 72% (95%CI 62%–81%), 99% (95% CI95%–100%), 99% (95%CI 93%–100%), and 78% (95%CI 70%–85%), 0.28 (95%CI 0.21–0.39), and 72 (95%CI 10–208) respectively. Sensitivity was higher for patients with Ct ≤ 25 regardless of TSO: TSO ≤ 4 days 92% (95%CI 75%–99%), TSO &gt; 4 days 100% (95%CI 54%–100%), and asymptomatic 100% (95%CI 78–100%). Overall, combining RAD and RT-qPCR would allow reducing from only 4% the number of RT-qPCR needed. Conclusions This study highlights the risk of misdiagnosing COVID-19 in 28% of patients if RAD is used alone. A stepwise analysis that combines RAD and RT-qPCR would be an efficient screening procedure for COVID-19 detection and may facilitate the control of the outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3200419166,"Purpose To investigate the differences in the choroidal biomarkers between two forms of flat irregular pigment epithelial detachment (FIPED): avascular (aFIPED) and vascularized (vFIPED) in eyes with chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Materials and methods Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) was done in eyes with FIPED correlated to chronic CSC, fellow eyes, and also in healthy eyes from gender- and age-matched subjects. Eyes with FIPED were classified into two subgroups based on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) findings: vFIPED and aFIPED. Different choroidal biomarkers such as subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT), total choroidal area (TCA), and choroidal vascular index (CVI) were compared between the groups. Results Forty-four eyes from 42 patients with chronic CSC and FIPED along with 40 eyes from 20 healthy subjects were included. OCTA identified vascularization in 14 eyes in the FIPED group (31.8%). Mean SFCT was higher in the FIPED group compared to two other groups (p = 0.005). In comparison to patients with aFIPED, patients with vFIPED had lower SFCT (p = 0.003) and higher CVI (p = 0.020) based on multivariate analysis. Conclusions It seems that measurement of CVI along with SFCT may help to differentiate aFIPED from vFIPED in patients with CSC. Further longitudinal studies would be required to confirm the clinical significance of these findings."
https://openalex.org/W3200437090,"Selecting a target journal is a universal decision faced by authors of scientific papers. Components of the decision, including expected turnaround time, journal acceptance rate, and journal impact factor, vary in terms of accessibility. In this study, I collated recent turnaround times and impact factors for 82 journals that publish papers in the field of fisheries sciences. In addition, I gathered acceptance rates for the same journals when possible. Findings indicated clear among-journal differences in turnaround time, with median times-to-publication ranging from 79 to 323 days. There was no clear correlation between turnaround time and acceptance rate nor between turnaround time and impact factor; however, acceptance rate and impact factor were negatively correlated. I found no field-wide differences in turnaround time since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, though some individual journals took significantly longer or significantly shorter to publish during the pandemic. Depending on their priorities, authors choosing a target journal should use the results of this study as guidance toward a more informed decision."

https://openalex.org/W3200824716,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) homeostatically matches endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein-folding capacity to cellular secretory needs. However, under high or chronic ER stress, the UPR triggers apoptosis. This cell fate dichotomy is promoted by differential activation of the ER transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase) IRE1α. We previously found that the RNase of IRE1α can be either fully activated or inactivated by ATP-competitive kinase inhibitors. Here we developed kinase inhibitors, partial antagonists of IRE1α RNase (PAIRs), that partially antagonize the IRE1α RNase at full occupancy. Biochemical and structural studies show that PAIRs promote partial RNase antagonism by intermediately displacing the helix αC in the IRE1α kinase domain. In insulin-producing β-cells, PAIRs permit adaptive splicing of Xbp1 mRNA while quelling destructive ER mRNA endonucleolytic decay and apoptosis. By preserving Xbp1 mRNA splicing, PAIRs allow B cells to differentiate into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells. Thus, an intermediate RNase-inhibitory ‘sweet spot’, achieved by PAIR-bound IRE1α, captures a desirable conformation for drugging this master UPR sensor/effector. Partial antagonists of the ER transmembrane kinase/endoribonuclease IRE1ɑ were identified that preserve splicing of downstream RNA substrates such as XBP1, enabling cellular survival."
https://openalex.org/W3199815568,"Topological data analysis is a recent and fast growing field that approaches the analysis of datasets using techniques from (algebraic) topology. Its main tool, persistent homology (PH), has seen a notable increase in applications in the last decade. Often cited as the most favourable property of PH and the main reason for practical success are the stability theorems that give theoretical results about noise robustness, since real data is typically contaminated with noise or measurement errors. However, little attention has been paid to what these stability theorems mean in practice. To gain some insight into this question, we evaluate the noise robustness of PH on the MNIST dataset of greyscale images. More precisely, we investigate to what extent PH changes under typical forms of image noise, and quantify the loss of performance in classifying the MNIST handwritten digits when noise is added to the data. The results show that the sensitivity to noise of PH is influenced by the choice of filtrations and persistence signatures (respectively the input and output of PH), and in particular, that PH features are often not robust to noise in a classification task."
https://openalex.org/W3200290439,"In order to investigate controversies surrounding the desire to die phenomenon in palliative care by analyzing expert opinions on the topic, we carried out a secondary qualitative data analysis of free text comments collected during a Delphi survey that was designed to develop a conversation aid for dealing with desire to die in everyday clinical practice. Between 01/2018 and 03/2018, a two-round Delphi survey was carried out with national (German) and international palliative care experts. Free text comments were reinvestigated to identify controversies surrounding the desire to die phenomenon. An additional in-depth analysis focused on statements expressing attitudes towards proactively addressing (potential) desires to die. Within the Delphi survey, 103 of 149 multi-professional participants (almost all of them with practical and only six with exclusively theoretical expertise in palliative care) generated 444 free text comments. Thereof, we identified three main categories related to dealing with desire to die: ""outer framework"", ""extended care system"" and ""health-professional-patient-relationship"". Ambivalences, taboos and uncertainties surrounding desire to die in palliative care became apparent. Experts are divided concerning the practice of proactively addressing desire to die. Even if these conversations-especially the proactive approach-are also viewed critically, we conclude that open-ended and respectful communication about desire to die between health professionals and patients can be understood as an eligible intervention in palliative care. Proactively addressing the topic is a possible way to open up such conversations."

https://openalex.org/W3198989457,"Cultured cells are a very powerful tool for investigating biological events in vitro ; therefore, cell lines have been established not only in model insect species, but also in non-model species. However, there are few reports on the establishment of stable cell lines and development of systems to introduce genes into the cultured cells of the honey bee ( Apis mellifera ). We describe a simple ex vivo cell culture system for the honey bee. Hemocyte cells obtained from third and fourth instar larvae were cultured in commercial Grace’s insect medium or MGM-450 insect medium for more than two weeks maintaining a normal morphology without deterioration. After an expression plasmid vector bearing the enhanced green fluorescent protein ( egfp ) gene driven by the immediate early 2 (IE2) viral promoter was transfected into cells, EGFP fluorescence was detected in cells for more than one week from one day after transfection. Furthermore, double-stranded RNA corresponding to a part of the egfp gene was successfully introduced into cells and interfered with egfp gene expression. A convenient and reproducible method for an ex vivo cell culture that is fully practicable for gene expression assays was established for the honey bee."
https://openalex.org/W3199262384,"ATB-346 is a hydrogen sulfide-releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (H2 S-NSAID) derived from naproxen, which in preclinical studies has been shown to have markedly reduced gastrointestinal adverse effects. However, its anti-inflammatory properties in humans compared to naproxen are yet to be confirmed. To test this, we used a dermal model of acute inflammation in healthy, human volunteers, triggered by ultraviolet-killed Escherichia coli. This robust model allows quantification of the cardinal signs of inflammation along with cellular and humoral factors accumulating within the inflamed skin. ATB-346 was non-inferior to naproxen in terms of its inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity as well as pain and tenderness. ATB-346 significantly inhibited neutrophil infiltration at the site of inflammation at 4 h, compared to untreated controls. Subjects treated with ATB-346 also experienced significantly reduced pain and tenderness compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, both classical and intermediate monocyte subsets infiltrating the site of inflammation at 48 h expressed significantly lower levels of CD14 compared to untreated controls, demonstrating a shift toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. Collectively, we have shown for the first time in humans that ATB-346 is potently anti-inflammatory and propose that ATB-346 represents the next generation of H2 S-NSAIDs, as a viable alternative to conventional NSAIDs, with reduced adverse effects profile."
https://openalex.org/W3200234801,"Depression is the fourth leading cause of adolescent illness and disability worldwide. A growing evidence base demonstrates that Short Term Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy [STPP] is an efficacious treatment for moderate to severe adolescent depression. However, with research in its infancy, key factors contributing to efficacy are unknown. Service users’ lived experiences provide valuable insight in this area. This study aimed to elucidate what adolescents value in treatment by inductively exploring lived experiences of STPP. Five adolescents with the largest reduction in depressive symptoms scores between baseline and end of treatment, who had taken part in a large-scale randomized controlled trial, were sampled. In-depth interviews carried out soon after the end of therapy were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Three superordinate themes were identified: “Therapy as a Transformational Process”, “Explorative and Exposing: The Therapeutic Space” and “Being Heard and Working Together: The Therapeutic Relationship”. Adolescents valued a process of collaborative exploration with the therapist which when it was achieved was felt to facilitate a deep-rooted transformation in self-perception. Additionally, they described how an adjustment was needed to the particular frame of a psychoanalytic therapy. However, not all participants with a good treatment outcome experienced therapy in this way, suggesting a potential gap between the quantitative assessment of outcomes, and the way young people experience and understand the change process. Clinical implications and directions for research are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3201618578,"Globally, around three billion people depend upon solid fuels such as firewood, dry animal dung, crop residues, or coal, and use traditional stoves for cooking and heating purposes. This solid fuel combustion causes indoor air pollution (IAP) and severely impairs health and the environment, especially in developing countries like Pakistan. A number of alternative household energy strategies can be adopted to mitigate IAP, such as using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), natural gas, biogas, electric stoves, or improved cook stoves (ICS). In this study, we estimate the benefit-cost ratios and net present value of these interventions over a ten-year period in Pakistan. Annual costs include both fixed and operating costs, whereas benefits cover health, productivity gains, time savings, and fuel savings. We find that LPG has the highest benefit-cost ratio, followed by natural gas, while ICS has the lowest benefit-cost ratio. Electric stoves and biogas have moderate benefit-cost ratios that nevertheless exceed one. To maximize the return on cleaner burning technology, the government of Pakistan should consider encouraging the adoption of LPG, piped natural gas, and electric stoves as means to reduce IAP and adopt clean technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3199651828,"PMR is a common inflammatory rheumatic disease. Although its clinical characteristics are fully recognized, no specific test for its diagnosis has been established to date. Several studies have described a wide variety of diseases that present with polymyalgic symptoms. A 18FDG-PET/CT scan could help to deal with these differential diagnoses. The goal of our study is to describe the findings of the 18FDG-PET/CT scan in a cohort of PMR patients and to detail how the 18FDG-PET/CT scan improves accuracy when diagnosing other underlying conditions. This cross-sectional study enrolled patients with a diagnosis of PMR who underwent to a 18FDG-PET/CT scan to rule out other diagnosis. The 18FDG-PET/CT scan was performed either following clinical criteria at the onset of clinical symptoms or when the patient became PMR steroid resistant. Patients' demographic, clinical and analytical data at the moment of the 18FDG-PET/CT scan were recorded. The final diagnosis was confirmed according to clinical judgement. A total of 103 patients with PMR were included. In 49.51% of patients, the 18FDG-PET/CT scan was ordered to study resistance to steroid therapy. The final diagnoses of patients were PMR in 70.9% patients, large vessel vasculitis in 15.5%, neoplasms 4.8% and another diagnosis in the rest. The 18FDG-PET/CT scan is a very useful technique for the study of Polymyalgia Rheumatica, not only to help in the diagnostic process, but also due to its role in the identification of a variety of PMR-like patrons."
https://openalex.org/W3200110965,"Cyclophosphamide (CP) has been widely used in the treatment of various malignancies and autoimmune diseases, but acrolein, a byproduct of CP, causes severe hemorrhagic cystitis as the major side effect of CP. On the other hand, a large amount of prostacyclin (PGI2 ) is produced in bladder tissues, and PGI2 has been shown to play a critical role in bladder homeostasis. PGI2 is biosynthesized from prostaglandin (PG) H2 , the common precursor of PGs, by PGI2 synthase (PTGIS) and is known to also be involved in inflammatory responses. However, little is known about the roles of PTGIS-derived PGI2 in bladder inflammation including CP-induced hemorrhagic cystitis. Using both genetic and pharmacological approaches, we here revealed that PTGIS-derived PGI2 -IP (PGI2 receptor) signaling exacerbated CP-induced bladder inflammatory reactions. Ptgis deficiency attenuated CP-induced vascular permeability and chemokine-mediated neutrophil migration into bladder tissues and then suppressed hemorrhagic cystitis. Treatment with RO1138452, an IP selective antagonist, also suppressed CP-induced cystitis. We further found that cystitis-related nociceptive behavior was also relieved in both Ptgis-/- mice and RO1138452-treated mice. Our findings may provide new drug targets for bladder inflammation and inflammatory pain in CP-induced hemorrhagic cystitis."
https://openalex.org/W3200223878,"The present study evaluates the effect of nickel oxide nanoparticles on some biochemical parameters and midgut tissues in the ground beetle Blaps polychresta as an indicator organism for nanotoxicity. Serial doses of the NiO-NPs colloid (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, and 0.06 mg/g) were prepared for injecting into the adult beetles. Insect survival was reported daily for 30 days, and the sublethal dose of 0.02 mg/g NiO-NPs was selected for the tested parameters. After the treatment, nickel was detected in the midgut tissues by X-ray microanalysis. The treated group demonstrated a significant increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities when compared to the untreated group. However, the treated group demonstrated a significant decrease in ascorbate peroxidase (APOX) activity when compared to the untreated group. Histological and ultrastructural changes in the midgut tissues of treated and untreated beetles were also observed. The current findings provide a precedent for describing the physiological and histological changes caused by NiO-NPs in the ground beetle B. polychresta."
https://openalex.org/W3200574123,"In obesity, skeletal muscle mitochondrial activity changes to cope with increased nutrient availability. Autophagy has been proposed as an essential mechanism involved in the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism. Still, the contribution of autophagy to mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscle during obesity is unknown. Here, we show that in response to high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, distinct skeletal muscles in mice exhibit differentially regulated autophagy that may modulate mitochondrial activity. We observed that after 4 and 40 weeks of high-fat diet feeding, OXPHOS subunits and mitochondrial DNA content increased in the oxidative soleus muscle. However, in gastrocnemius muscle, which has a mixed fiber-type composition, the mitochondrial mass increased only after 40 weeks of HFD feeding. Interestingly, fatty acid-supported mitochondrial respiration was enhanced in gastrocnemius, but not in soleus muscle after a 4-week HFD feeding. This increased metabolic profile in gastrocnemius was paralleled by preserving autophagy flux, while autophagy flux in soleus was reduced. To determine the role of autophagy in this differential response, we used an autophagy-deficient mouse model with partial deletion of Atg7 specifically in skeletal muscle (SkM-Atg7+/- mice). We observed that Atg7 reduction resulted in diminished autophagic flux in skeletal muscle, alongside blunting the HFD-induced increase in fatty acid-supported mitochondrial respiration observed in gastrocnemius. Remarkably, SkM-Atg7+/- mice did not present increased mitochondria accumulation. Altogether, our results show that HFD triggers specific mitochondrial adaptations in skeletal muscles with different fiber type compositions, and that Atg7-mediated autophagy modulates mitochondrial respiratory capacity but not its content in response to an obesogenic diet."
https://openalex.org/W3201584128,"Objectives To assess the oral health of older people who visit the community dental practice from both the dentists’ and the patients’ perspective. Materials and methods In this exploratory cross-sectional study the oral health of Dutch community dwelling older people was assessed. A representative sample of general dental practitioners was asked to randomly and prospectively select one older patient and describe this patient using a specially-developed registration form; in addition the patient was requested to complete a questionnaire. The oral health of older people was described from the perspective of the dentists and the perspective of the older people themselves based on the definition of oral health from the World Dental Federation (FDI]. Relations between oral health of older people and dentist and older patient characteristics were analysed using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (rho) and an ordinal regression model. Results In total, 923 dentists were asked to participate in the study; data was available for 39.4% dentist-patient pairs. Dentists assessed the oral health of older patients as good or acceptable in 51.4% of the cases while this was the case in 76.2% of older patients themselves. The assessment of the dentist gets more negative with high treatment intensity and with older patients having certain diseases and more medication, while the assessment is more positive for older patients who visit the dentist on a regular basis. Older people’s assessment of their oral health gets more negative by being female and with high treatment intensity, having certain diseases and higher use of medication. Conclusions and clinical relevance Chronically illness as expressed by the number of diseases and the use of medication, seems to be a risk factor for poor oral health. Older patients themselves assess their oral health differently, mostly more positive, than their dentist."
https://openalex.org/W3201637646,"In data modelling using the composite Pareto distribution, any observations above a particular threshold value are assumed to follow Pareto type distribution, whereas the rest of the observations are assumed to follow a different distribution. This paper proposes on the use of Bayesian approach to the composite Pareto models involving specification of the prior distribution on the proportion of data coming from the Pareto distribution, instead of assuming the prior distribution on the threshold, as often done in the literature. Based on a simulation study, it is found that the parameter estimates determined when using uniform prior on the proportion is less biased as compared to the point estimates determined when using uniform prior on the threshold. Applications on income data and finance are included for illustrative examples."
https://openalex.org/W3199069748,"Background The World Health Organization’s “ Coordinated Global Research Roadmap : 2019 Novel Coronavirus ” outlined the need for research that focuses on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and children. More than one year after the first reported case significant knowledge gaps remain, highlighting the need for a coordinated approach. To address this need, the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Working Group (MNCH WG) of the COVID-19 Clinical Research Coalition conducted an international survey to identify global research priorities for COVID-19 in maternal, reproductive and child health. Method This project was undertaken using a modified Delphi method. An electronic questionnaire was disseminated to clinicians and researchers in three different languages (English, French and Spanish) via MNCH WG affiliated networks. Respondents were asked to select the five most urgent research priorities among a list of 17 identified by the MNCH WG. Analysis of questionnaire data was undertaken to identify key similarities and differences among respondents according to questionnaire language, location and specialty. Following elimination of the seven lowest ranking priorities, the questionnaire was recirculated to the original pool of respondents. Thematic analysis of final questionnaire data was undertaken by the MNCH WG from which four priority research themes emerged. Results Questionnaire 1 was completed by 225 respondents from 29 countries. Questionnaire 2 was returned by 49 respondents. The four priority research themes which emerged from the analysis were 1) access to healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) the direct and 3) indirect effects of COVID-19 on pregnant and breastfeeding women and children and 4) the transmission of COVID-19 and protection from infection. Conclusion The results of these questionnaires indicated a high level of concordance among continents and specialties regarding priority research themes. This prioritized list of research uncertainties, developed to specifically highlight the most urgent clinical needs as perceived by healthcare professionals and researchers, could help funding organizations and researchers to answer the most pressing questions for clinicians and public health professionals during the pandemic. It is hoped that these identified priority research themes can help focus the discussion regarding the allocation of limited resources to enhance COVID-19 research in MNCH globally."
https://openalex.org/W3199141015,"Hospital Based Health Technology Assessment (HB-HTA) is a new policy implemented in Poland to allow for a more practical and contextualized assessment related to the use of specific medical procedures, devices, or equipment. It requires changes in governance relating to the healthcare sector. One of the forms of governance improvement is to involve society in the process of creating public services. This can be implemented, e.g., by applying the pragmatic model of public responsiveness. The aim of this research was to identify and analyze forces which will shape a dynamic process in determining the implementation of HB-HTA. The results obtained in the Gioia analysis led to the identification of the main forces driving and restraining the implementation of HB-HTA. The grouping and interpretation allowed for the twelve most important dimensions to be distinguished, which were recognized as conceptual categories necessary to build theories that describe the studied phenomenon. This study contributes to the development of the idea of responsiveness in public management theory and in health care services, and ultimately helps to better enable the adjustment of health services to the dynamically changing needs of Polish society."
https://openalex.org/W3199318927,"Recently, a new defibrillation modality using nanosecond pulses was shown to be effective at much lower energies than conventional 10 millisecond monophasic shocks in ex vivo experiments. Here we compare the safety factors of 300 nanosecond and 10 millisecond shocks to assess the safety of nanosecond defibrillation.The safety factor, i.e. the ratio of median effective doses (ED50) for electroporative damage and defibrillation, was assessed for nanosecond and conventional (millisecond) defibrillation shocks in Langendorff-perfused New Zealand white rabbit hearts. In order to allow for multiple shock applications in a single heart, a pair of needle electrodes was used to apply shocks of varying voltage. Propidium iodide (PI) staining at the surface of the heart showed that nanosecond shocks had a slightly lower safety factor (6.50) than millisecond shocks (8.69), p = 0.02; while PI staining cross-sections in the electrode plane showed no significant difference (5.38 for 300 ns shocks and 6.29 for 10 ms shocks, p = 0.22).In Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, nanosecond defibrillation has a similar safety factor as millisecond defibrillation, between 5 and 9, suggesting that nanosecond defibrillation can be performed safely."
https://openalex.org/W3199971114,"Intolerance of Uncertainty (IU) is thought to lead to maladaptive behaviours and dysfunctional decision making, both in the clinical and healthy population. The seminal study reported by Luhmann and collaborators in 2011 [1] showed that IU was negatively associated with choosing a delayed, but more probable and valuable, reward over choosing an immediate, but less probable and valuable, reward. These findings have been widely disseminated across the field of personality and individual differences because of their relevance for the understanding of the role of IU in the development and maintenance of anxiety-related disorders. Given their importance it would be desirable to have replications of this study, but none have been carried out so far. The current study has been designed to replicate and extend Luhmann et al.'s results. Our sample will include 266 healthy participants (more than five times the sample size used by Luhmann et al.) to detect with a power of 95% the effect size that can be detected with a power of 33% in the original study. To increase our chances of getting such a sample size, the experiment will be conducted online, To increase our chances of getting such a sample size, the experiment will be conducted online, adding check trials to the original decision-making task to monitor participants' engagement. Additionally, we will explore the role of impulsivity in the relationship between IU and willingness to wait. This study will add empirical evidence about the role of IU in decision making and, in case of replication of Luhmann et al.'s results, will support the hypothesis that high-IU individuals may engage in inefficient or costly behaviour in exchange for less time enduring an uncertain situation."
https://openalex.org/W3199594095,"Road Traffic crash injury is one of the main public health problems resulting in premature death and disability particularly in low-income countries. However, there is limited evidence on the crash fractures in Ethiopia.The study was conducted to assess the magnitude of road traffic crash fractures and visceral injuries.A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 420 fracture patients. Participants were randomly selected from Addis Ababa City hospitals. The study was carried out between November 2019 and February 2020. Data were collected using a questionnaire and record of medical findings. Multilevel logistic regression analysis was carried out. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Addis Ababa University, College of Health Sciences Institutional Review Board. Confidentiality of participants' information was maintained.The study found out that the majority 265 (63. 1%) of fracture cases were younger in the age group of 18 to 34 years. Males were more affected-311(74.0%). The mortality rate was 59(14.1%), of those 50(85.0%) participants were males. The major road traffic victims were pedestrians-220(52.4%), mainly affected by simple fracture type -105(53.3%) and compound fracture type-92(46. 7%). Drivers mainly suffered from compound fracture type -23 (59.0%). One hundred eighty-two (43.3%) of fracture patients had a visceral injury. Homeless persons who sit or sleep on the roadside had a higher risk of thoracic visceral injury compared to traveler pedestrians (AOR = 4.600(95%CI: 1.215-17.417)); P = 0.025.Visceral injury, simple and compound fractures were the common orthopedic injury types reported among crash victims. Males, pedestrians, and young age groups were largely affected by orthopedic fracture cases. Homeless persons who sited or slept on the roadside were significant factors for visceral injury. Therefore, preventing a harmful crash and growing fracture care should be considered to reduce the burden of crash fracture."
https://openalex.org/W3199608281,"Background In clinical practice, the same chemotherapeutic agents are occasionally reused (re-challenge) after failure of all available standard chemotherapy options for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, the benefits of re-challenge chemotherapy (Re-Cx) are unclear. This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of Re-Cx, focusing on the tumor growth rate (TGR). Methods The study included mCRC patients with measurable lesions who received Re-Cx from November 2011 to October 2018 at National Cancer Center Hospital. Re-Cx was defined as re-administration of agents which had been used in prior lines of chemotherapy and discontinued due to disease progression. We compared the TGR immediately after initiating Re-Cx regimens with that observed at the time of disease progression during prior chemotherapy (Prior-Cx) immediately before Re-Cx. Results Of the 25 patients who received Re-Cx, five patients received two Re-Cx regimens. Therefore, a total of 30 cases of Re-Cx were analyzed in this study. The regimens of Re-Cx were oxaliplatin based (19 cases), irinotecan based (8 cases), and others (3 cases). Although the objective response rate to Re-Cx was 0%, the disease control rate was 60% (18 cases), and 40% (12 cases) showed some tumor shrinkage. We compared the effects of Re-Cx and Prior-Cx by the TGR and found that the TGR of Re-Cx was slower than that recorded in Prior-Cx in 26 of 30 cases (87%). In particular, the ratio of% TGR &lt;0, which indicates tumor shrinkage, was obtained in 13 of 30 cases (43.3%). The median progression-free survival and overall survival after Re-Cx were 3.8 and 6.57 months, respectively. Conclusion We found that Re-Cx may have some anti-tumor efficacy as salvage treatment for mCRC and these results also suggested the clinical benefits of Re-Cx."
https://openalex.org/W3199613194,"The MORDOR study, a masked, community-level randomized clinical trial conducted in Niger, Malawi and Tanzania (2015 to 2017), showed that biannual administration of single-dose azithromycin to preschool children reduced all-cause mortality. We sought to evaluate its impact on causes of death in children aged 1-59 months in Tanzania. A random sampling of 614 communities was conducted in Kilosa District, Tanzania, with simple random assignment of communities to receive either azithromycin or placebo. In these communities, a census was carried out every 6 months and children aged 1-59 months received biannual (every 6 months), single-dose azithromycin (~20mg/kg) or placebo depending on community assignment, over a 2-year period. Mortality was determined at the time of the biannual census. For child deaths, a verbal autopsy was performed to ascertain the cause using a standardized diagnostic classification. A total of 190- (0.58 /100 person-years) and 200 deaths (0.59/100 person-years) were reported in the azithromycin and placebo arms, respectively. Malaria, pneumonia and diarrhea, accounted for 71% and 68% of deaths in the respective arms. Overall, the mortality was not different by treatment arm, nor were the distribution of causes of death after adjusting for community clustering. The cause-specific mortality for diarrhea/pneumonia was no different over time. In children aged 1-5 months, 32 deaths occurred in the placebo arm and 25 deaths occurred in the azithromycin arm; 20 (62.5%) deaths in the placebo- and 10 (40%) in the azithromycin arm were attributed to diarrhea or pneumonia. Neither differences in the number of deaths nor the diarrhea/pneumonia attribution was statistically significant after adjusting for community clustering. In conclusion, azithromycin was not associated with a significant decline in deaths by specific causes compared to placebo. The non-significant lower rates of diarrhea or pneumonia in children <6 months who received azithromycin merit further investigation in high-mortality settings. Trial registration: NCT02048007."
https://openalex.org/W3199755647,"Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening illness characterized by decreased alveolar-capillary barrier function, pulmonary edema consisting of proteinaceous fluid, and inhibition of net alveolar fluid transport responsible for resolution of pulmonary edema. There is currently no pharmacotherapy that has proven useful to prevent or treat ARDS, and two trials using beta-agonist therapy to treat ARDS demonstrated no effect. Prior studies indicated that IL-8-induced heterologous desensitization of the beta2-adrenergic receptor (β2 -AR) led to decreased beta-agonist-induced mobilization of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Interestingly, phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors have been used in human airway diseases characterized by low intracellular cAMP levels and increases in specific cAMP hydrolyzing activity. Therefore, we hypothesized that PDE4 would mediate IL-8-induced heterologous internalization of the β2 -AR and that PDE4 inhibition would restore beta-agonist-induced functions. We determined that CINC-1 (a functional IL-8 analog in rats) induces internalization of β2 -AR from the cell surface, and arrestin-2, PDE4, and β2 -AR form a complex during this process. Furthermore, we determined that cAMP associated with the plasma membrane was adversely affected by β2 -AR heterologous desensitization. Additionally, we determined that rolipram, a PDE4 inhibitor, reversed CINC-1-induced derangements of cAMP and also caused β2 -AR to successfully recycle back to the cell surface. Finally, we demonstrated that rolipram could reverse CINC-1-mediated inhibition of beta-agonist-induced alveolar fluid clearance in a murine model of trauma-shock. These results indicate that PDE4 plays a role in CINC-1-induced heterologous internalization of the β2 -AR; PDE4 inhibition reverses these effects and may be a useful adjunct in particular ARDS patients."
