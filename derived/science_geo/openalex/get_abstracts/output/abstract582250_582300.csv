https://openalex.org/W2597440646,"During epithelial cytokinesis, the remodelling of adhesive cell-cell contacts between the dividing cell and its neighbours has profound implications for the integrity, arrangement and morphogenesis of proliferative tissues. In both vertebrates and invertebrates, this remodelling requires the activity of non-muscle myosin II (MyoII) in the interphasic cells neighbouring the dividing cell. However, the mechanisms that coordinate cytokinesis and MyoII activity in the neighbours are unknown. Here we show that in the Drosophila notum epithelium, each cell division is associated with a mechanosensing and transmission event that controls MyoII dynamics in neighbouring cells. We find that the ring pulling forces promote local junction elongation, which results in local E-cadherin dilution at the ingressing adherens junction. In turn, the reduction in E-cadherin concentration and the contractility of the neighbouring cells promote self-organized actomyosin flows, ultimately leading to accumulation of MyoII at the base of the ingressing junction. Although force transduction has been extensively studied in the context of adherens junction reinforcement to stabilize adhesive cell-cell contacts, we propose an alternative mechanosensing mechanism that coordinates actomyosin dynamics between epithelial cells and sustains the remodelling of the adherens junction in response to mechanical forces."
https://openalex.org/W2611404165,"Breast cancer patients often experience a high level of distress. Psychological distress is a broad construct encompass both depression and anxiety. Previous studies in examining which of these psychological symptoms (either anxiety or depression) were more significantly associated with the distress level in breast cancer patients is lacking. This study aims to compare the level of depression and anxiety between patients with different level of distress. The correlation between the changes in distress level with depression or anxiety over 12 months was also examined.This study is from the MyBCC cohort study. Two hundred and twenty one female breast cancer patients were included into the study. They were assessed at the time of diagnosis, 6 months and 12 month using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and distress thermometer. The information on age, ethnicity, treatment types and staging of cancer were collected.50.2%, 51.6% and 40.3% of patients had perceived high level of distress at baseline, 6 months and 1 year after diagnosis. Those with high perceived level of distress had significant higher anxiety scores even after adjusted for the underlying depressive scores (Adjusted OR at baseline = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.13-1.44; adjusted OR at 6 months = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.11-1.45; adjusted OR at 12 months = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.29-1.76). There were no significant differences in the depressive scores between the subjects with either low or high distress level. There was reduction in perceived level of distress, anxiety and depression scores at 12 months after the diagnosis. The decrease of distress was positively correlated with the reduction of anxiety scores but not the changes of depressive scores (r' = 0.25).Anxiety is a more significant psychological state that contributed to the feeling of distress in breast cancer as compared with depression. Levels of anxiety at diagnosis in this study would justify screening for anxiety, early identification and therapy for maintaining the psychological well-being of breast cancer patients. Further studies will be needed to measure the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions."

Methods The expression profiles of miRNAs in serum from patients with sepsis-induced AKI (n = 6), sepsis-non AKI (n = 6), and healthy volunteers (n = 3) were investigated by microarray assay and validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR). The targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs were predicted by Target Scan, mirbase and Miranda. Then the significant functions and involvement in signaling pathways of gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathways were analyzed. Furthermore, eight miRNAs were randomly selected out of the differentially expressed miRNAs for further testing by qPCR. Results qPCR analysis confirmed that the expressions levels of hsa-miR-23a-3p, hsa-miR-4456, hsa-miR-142-5p, hsa-miR-22-3p and hsa-miR-191-5p were significantly lower in patients with sepsis compared with the healthy volunteers, while hsa-miR-4270, hsa-miR-4321, hsa-miR-3165 were higher in the sepsis patients. Statistically, miR-4321; miR-4270 were significantly upregulated in the sepsis-induced AKI compared with sepsis-non AKI, while only miR-4321 significantly overexpressed in the sepsis groups compared with control groups. GO analysis showed that biological processes regulated by the predicted target genes included diverse terms. They were related to kidney development, regulation of nitrogen compound metabolic process, regulation of cellular metabolic process, cellular response to oxidative stress, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, etc. Pathway analysis showed that several significant pathways of the predicted target genes related to oxidative stress. miR-4321 was involved in regulating AKT1, mTOR and NOX5 expression while miR-4270 was involved in regulating PPARGC1A, AKT3, NOX5, PIK3C3, WNT1 expression. Function and pathway analysis highlighted the possible involvement of miRNA-deregulated mRNAs in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Conclusion This study might help to improve understanding of the relationship between serum miRNAs and sepsis-induced AKI, and laid an important foundation for further identification of the potential mechanisms of sepsis-induced AKI and oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2609059742,"A survey in the United States revealed that an alarmingly large percentage of university psychologists admitted having used questionable research practices that can contaminate the research literature with false positive and biased findings. We conducted a replication of this study among Italian research psychologists to investigate whether these findings generalize to other countries. All the original materials were translated into Italian, and members of the Italian Association of Psychology were invited to participate via an online survey. The percentages of Italian psychologists who admitted to having used ten questionable research practices were similar to the results obtained in the United States although there were small but significant differences in self-admission rates for some QRPs. Nearly all researchers (88%) admitted using at least one of the practices, and researchers generally considered a practice possibly defensible if they admitted using it, but Italian researchers were much less likely than US researchers to consider a practice defensible. Participants’ estimates of the percentage of researchers who have used these practices were greater than the self-admission rates, and participants estimated that researchers would be unlikely to admit it. In written responses, participants argued that some of these practices are not questionable and they have used some practices because reviewers and journals demand it. The similarity of results obtained in the United States, this study, and a related study conducted in Germany suggest that adoption of these practices is an international phenomenon and is likely due to systemic features of the international research and publication processes."
https://openalex.org/W2720101788,"Although arsenite [As(III)] is non-essential and toxic for plants, it is effectively absorbed through various transporters into the roots. Here we identified a calcium-dependent protein kinase (CPK31) response for As(III) tolerance in Arabidopsis. We identified CPK31 as an interacting protein of a nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP1;1), an aquaporin involved in As(III) uptake. Similarly to the nip1;1 mutants, the loss-of-function mutants of CPK31 improved the tolerance against As(III) but not As(V), and accumulated less As(III) in roots than that of the wild-type plants. The promoter-β-glucuronidase and quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis revealed that CPK31 displayed overlapping expression profiles with NIP1;1 in the roots, suggesting that they might function together in roots. Indeed, the cpk31 nip1;1 double mutants exhibited stronger As(III) tolerance than cpk31 mutants, but similar to nip1;1 mutants, supporting the idea that CPK31 might serve as an upstream regulator of NIP1;1. Furthermore, transient CPK31 overexpression induced by dexamethasone caused the decrease in As(III) tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis lines. These findings reveal that CPK31 is a key factor in As(III) response in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2640028726,"Aim To conduct a meta-ethnographic study of the experiences, meanings and ways of ‘dealing with’ symptoms or a diagnosis of postnatal depression amongst migrant women living in high income countries. Background Prevalence of postnatal depression is highest amongst women who are migrants. Yet many women do not seek help for their symptoms and health services do not always respond appropriately to migrant women’s needs. Studies have reported migrant women’s experiences of postnatal depression and it is timely to synthesise findings from these studies to understand how services can be improved. Design A meta-ethnographic synthesis of 12 studies reported in 15 papers Data sources Five databases were searched for papers published between January 1999 and February 2016 Review methods The quality of included studies was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool. The synthesis process was guided by the seven steps of meta-ethnography outlined by Noblit and Hare. Findings Four key metaphors were identified: “I am alone, worried and angry—this is not me!”; ‘Making sense of my feelings’ ‘Dealing with my feelings’ and ‘What I need to change the way I feel!’. Primarily women related their feelings to their position as a migrant and as women, often living in poor socio-economic circumstances and they were exhausted keeping up with expected commitments. Many women were resourceful, drawing on their personal strengths and family / community resources. All the studies reported that women experienced difficulties in accessing appropriate services. Conclusion The meta-ethnographic study demonstrates the impact of migration on perinatal mental health, particularly for women lacking family support, who have no employment, a precarious migration status and/or relationship conflict. Migrant women are resourceful and this requires support through appropriate services. Further research is needed to evaluate effective support strategies for migrant women in the perinatal period."
https://openalex.org/W2687567072,"Recent climate change has been especially pronounced in the High Arctic, however, the responses of aquatic biota, such as diatoms, can be modified by site-specific environmental characteristics. To assess if climate-mediated ice cover changes affect the diatom response to climate, we used paleolimnological techniques to examine shifts in diatom assemblages from ten High Arctic lakes and ponds from Ellesmere Island and nearby Pim Island (Nunavut, Canada). The sites were divided a priori into four groups (""warm"", ""cool"", ""cold"", and ""oasis"") based on local elevation and microclimatic differences that result in differing lengths of the ice-free season, as well as about three decades of personal observations. We characterized the species changes as a shift from Condition 1 (i.e. a generally low diversity, predominantly epipelic and epilithic diatom assemblage) to Condition 2 (i.e. a typically more diverse and ecologically complex assemblage with an increasing proportion of epiphytic species). This shift from Condition 1 to Condition 2 was a consistent pattern recorded across the sites that experienced a change in ice cover with warming. The ""warm"" sites are amongst the first to lose their ice covers in summer and recorded the earliest and highest magnitude changes. The ""cool"" sites also exhibited a shift from Condition 1 to Condition 2, but, as predicted, the timing of the response lagged the ""warm"" sites. Meanwhile some of the ""cold"" sites, which until recently still retained an ice raft in summer, only exhibited this shift in the upper-most sediments. The warmer ""oasis"" ponds likely supported aquatic vegetation throughout their records. Consequently, the diatoms of the ""oasis"" sites were characterized as high-diversity, Condition 2 assemblages throughout the record. Our results support the hypothesis that the length of the ice-free season is the principal driver of diatom assemblage responses to climate in the High Arctic, largely driven by the establishment of new aquatic habitats, resulting in increased diversity and the emergence of novel growth forms and epiphytic species."
https://openalex.org/W2592021744,"The late Permian mass extinction event was the largest biotic crisis of the Phanerozoic and has the longest recovery interval of any extinction event. It has been hypothesised that subsequent carbon isotope perturbations during the Early Triassic are associated with biotic crises that impeded benthic recovery. We test this hypothesis by undertaking the highest-resolution study yet made of the rock and fossil records of the entire Werfen Formation, Italy. Here, we show that elevated extinction rates were recorded not only in the Dienerian, as previously recognised, but also around the Smithian/Spathian boundary. Functional richness increases across the Smithian/Spathian boundary associated with elevated origination rates in the lower Spathian. The taxonomic and functional composition of benthic faunas only recorded two significant changes: (1) reduced heterogeneity in the Dienerian, and (2) and a faunal turnover across the Smithian/Spathian boundary. The elevated extinctions and compositional shifts in the Dienerian and across the Smithian/Spathian boundary are associated with a negative and positive isotope excursion, respectively, which supports the hypothesis that subsequent biotic crises are associated with carbon isotope shifts. The Spathian fauna represents a more advanced ecological state, not recognised in the previous members of the Werfen Formation, with increased habitat differentiation, a shift in the dominant modes of life, appearance of stenohaline taxa and the occupation of the erect and infaunal tiers. In addition to subsequent biotic crises delaying the recovery, therefore, persistent environmental stress limited the ecological complexity of benthic recovery prior to the Spathian."
https://openalex.org/W2661779417,"The Protein Data Bank (PDB; http://wwpdb.org) was established in 1971 as the first open access digital data resource in biology with seven protein structures as its initial holdings. The global PDB archive now contains more than 126,000 experimentally determined atomic level three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules (proteins, DNA, RNA), all of which are freely accessible via the Internet. Knowledge of the 3D structure of the gene product can help in understanding its function and role in disease. Of particular interest in the PDB archive are proteins for which 3D structures of genetic variant proteins have been determined, thus revealing atomic-level structural differences caused by the variation at the DNA level. Herein, we present a systematic and qualitative analysis of such cases. We observe a wide range of structural and functional changes caused by single amino acid differences, including changes in enzyme activity, aggregation propensity, structural stability, binding, and dissociation, some in the context of large assemblies. Structural comparison of wild type and mutated proteins, when both are available, provide insights into atomic-level structural differences caused by the genetic variation."
https://openalex.org/W2603796593,"Vertebrate sexual fate is decided primarily by the individual’s genotype (GSD), by the environmental temperature during development (TSD), or both. Turtles exhibit TSD and GSD, making them ideal to study the evolution of sex determination. Here we analyze temperature-specific gonadal transcriptomes (RNA-sequencing validated by qPCR) of painted turtles (Chrysemys picta TSD) before and during the thermosensitive period, and at equivalent stages in soft-shell turtles (Apalone spinifera—GSD), to test whether TSD’s and GSD’s transcriptional circuitry is identical but deployed differently between mechanisms. Our data show that most elements of the mammalian urogenital network are active during turtle gonadogenesis, but their transcription is generally more thermoresponsive in TSD than GSD, and concordant with their sex-specific function in mammals [e.g., upregulation of Amh, Ar, Esr1, Fog2, Gata4, Igf1r, Insr, and Lhx9 at male-producing temperature, and of β-catenin, Foxl2, Aromatase (Cyp19a1), Fst, Nf-kb, Crabp2 at female-producing temperature in Chrysemys]. Notably, antagonistic elements in gonadogenesis (e.g., β-catenin and Insr) were thermosensitive only in TSD early-embryos. Cirbp showed warm-temperature upregulation in both turtles disputing its purported key TSD role. Genes that may convert thermal inputs into sex-specific development (e.g., signaling and hormonal pathways, RNA-binding and heat-shock) were differentially regulated. Jak-Stat, Nf-κB, retinoic-acid, Wnt, and Mapk-signaling (not Akt and Ras-signaling) potentially mediate TSD thermosensitivity. Numerous species-specific ncRNAs (including Xist) were differentially-expressed, mostly upregulated at colder temperatures, as were unannotated loci that constitute novel TSD candidates. Cirbp showed warm-temperature upregulation in both turtles. Consistent transcription between turtles and alligator revealed putatively-critical reptilian TSD elements for male (Sf1, Amh, Amhr2) and female (Crabp2 and Hspb1) gonadogenesis. In conclusion, while preliminary, our data helps illuminate the regulation and evolution of vertebrate sex determination, and contribute genomic resources to guide further research into this fundamental biological process."
https://openalex.org/W2610507653,"The ColonCancerCheck screening program for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Ontario, Canada, is considering switching from biennial guaiac fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) screening between age 50-74 years to the more sensitive, but also less specific fecal immunochemical test (FIT). The aim of this study is to estimate whether the additional benefits of FIT screening compared to gFOBT outweigh the additional costs and harms.We used microsimulation modeling to estimate quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and costs of gFOBT and FIT, compared to no screening, in a cohort of screening participants. We compared strategies with various age ranges, screening intervals, and cut-off levels for FIT. Cost-efficient strategies were determined for various levels of available colonoscopy capacity.Compared to no screening, biennial gFOBT screening between age 50-74 years provided 20 QALYs at a cost of CAN$200,900 per 1,000 participants, and required 17 colonoscopies per 1,000 participants per year. FIT screening was more effective and less costly. For the same level of colonoscopy requirement, biennial FIT (with a high cut-off level of 200 ng Hb/ml) between age 50-74 years provided 11 extra QALYs gained while saving CAN$333,300 per 1000 participants, compared to gFOBT. Without restrictions in colonoscopy capacity, FIT (with a low cut-off level of 50 ng Hb/ml) every year between age 45-80 years was the most cost-effective strategy providing 27 extra QALYs gained per 1000 participants, while saving CAN$448,300.Compared to gFOBT screening, switching to FIT at a high cut-off level could increase the health benefits of a CRC screening program without considerably increasing colonoscopy demand."
https://openalex.org/W2671175007,"Conventional wisdom holds that a decline in oral health accompanies the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture, given increased consumption of carbohydrates. This widely touted example of the mismatch between our biology and modern lifestyle has been intuited largely from the bioarchaeological record of the Neolithic Revolution in the New World. Recent studies of other populations have, however, challenged the universality of this assertion. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of oral health among a living population in transition from the bush to village life, the Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, to test the hypothesis that the shift from foraging to farming, or agricultural intensification, inevitably leads to increased periodontal disease, caries, and orthodontic disorders. Our results showed that women living in villages consuming a mostly agricultural diet exhibited more caries and periodontal disease than those living in the bush consuming a mostly wild-food diet. Furthermore, men living in the bush consuming mostly a wild-food diet had more than those living in the village consuming a mostly agricultural diet. These findings are explained by the high incidence of maize consumption in village settings, along with previously recognized variation in rate of caries between men and women. The unexpected discovery of high caries incidences for men in the bush is likely explained by heavy reliance on honey, and perhaps differential access to tobacco and marijuana. These data support the notions that mechanisms of cariogenesis are multifactorial and that the relationships between oral health and the shift from a predominantly wild-food diet to one dominated by cultigens are nuanced."
https://openalex.org/W2653453176,"Cryptochromes are evolutionarily conserved blue-light absorbing flavoproteins which participate in many important cellular processes including in entrainment of the circadian clock in plants, Drosophila and humans. Drosophila melanogaster cryptochrome (DmCry) absorbs light through a flavin (FAD) cofactor that undergoes photoreduction to the anionic radical (FAD•-) redox state both in vitro and in vivo. However, recent efforts to link this photoconversion to the initiation of a biological response have remained controversial. Here, we show by kinetic modeling of the DmCry photocycle that the fluence dependence, quantum yield, and half-life of flavin redox state interconversion are consistent with the anionic radical (FAD•-) as the signaling state in vivo. We show by fluorescence detection techniques that illumination of purified DmCry results in enzymatic conversion of molecular oxygen (O2) to reactive oxygen species (ROS). We extend these observations in living cells to demonstrate transient formation of superoxide (O2•-), and accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the nucleus of insect cell cultures upon DmCry illumination. These results define the kinetic parameters of the Drosophila cryptochrome photocycle and support light-driven electron transfer to the flavin in DmCry signaling. They furthermore raise the intriguing possibility that light-dependent formation of ROS as a byproduct of the cryptochrome photocycle may contribute to its signaling role."
https://openalex.org/W2709112375,"We have identified the small molecule STK899704 as a structurally novel tubulin inhibitor. STK899704 suppressed the proliferation of cancer cell lines from various origins with IC50 values ranging from 0.2 to 1.0 μM. STK899704 prevented the polymerization of purified tubulin in vitro and also depolymerized microtubule in cultured cells leading to mitotic arrest, associated with increased Cdc25C phosphorylation and the accumulation of both cyclin B1 and polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), and apoptosis. Unlike many anticancer drugs such as Taxol and doxorubicin, STK899704 effectively displayed antiproliferative activity against multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines. The proposed binding mode of STK899704 is at the interface between αβ-tubulin heterodimer overlapping with the colchicine-binding site. Our in vivo carcinogenesis model further showed that STK 899704 is potent in both the prevention and regression of tumors, remarkably reducing the number and volume of skin tumor by STK899704 treatment. Moreover, it was significant to note that the efficacy of STK899704 was surprisingly comparable to 5-fluorouracil, a widely used anticancer therapeutic. Thus, our results demonstrate the potential of STK899704 to be developed as an anticancer chemotherapeutic and an alternative candidate for existing therapies."

The specificity and functions of NPP5 are unknown. NPP7 (alk-SMase) is the only NPP that hydrolyzes SM and is thus one of the mammalian SMases, along with the acid SMase and the four neutral SMases, classified by their optimum activity pH. Acid SMase is found in lysosomes, on the outer face of the cell membrane, and in the circulation (17Kornhuber J. Rhein C. Müller C.P. Mühle C. Secretory sphingomyelinase in health and disease.Biol. Chem. 2015; 396: 707-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), whereas its neutral counterparts are located on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, nucleus, or mitochondria (18Airola M.V. Hannun Y.A. Sphingolipid metabolism and neutral sphingomyelinases.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2013; 215: 57-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Digestion of dietary fats is assisted by their solubilization with bile in the small intestine. Bile contains lipids and bile salts, a class of physiological detergents. Bile salts are cholesterol derivatives with up to three hydroxyl groups on one face of their roughly planar ring system and often bear a conjugated glycine or taurine residue on their tail, conferring to them a negative charge. Their physiological concentration can reach 20 mm (19Maldonado-Valderrama J. Wilde P. Macierzanka A. Mackie A. The role of bile salts in digestion.Adv. Colloid. Interface Sci. 2011; 165: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Intestinal alk-SMase acts on its substrate solubilized by bile salts, a characteristic distinguishing it from the other mammalian SMases and NPPs but common to other digestive lipases. In vitro, taurocholate (TC) and taurochenodeoxycholate are the most stimulatory bile salts, whereas other detergents commonly used for acid and neutral SMase assays, such as CHAPS and Triton X-100, are not conducive to alk-SMase activity (3Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G. Hertervig E. Liu J.J. Syk I. Sjostrom H. Nilsson A. Purification, localization, and expression of human intestinal alkaline sphingomyelinase.J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this bile salt dependence and for the specificity of NPP7 for SM among the NPPs is unknown. First isolated 20 years ago (20Duan R.D. Nilsson A. Purification of a newly identified alkaline sphingomyelinase in human bile and effects of bile salts and phosphatidylcholine on enzyme activity.Hepatology. 1997; 26: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), this protein has not yet been structurally characterized, although it has been the subject of molecular modeling studies (21Duan J.

Pham T.C. Baker D.L. Computational identification and experimental characterization of substrate binding determinants of nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 7.BMC Biochem. 2011; 12: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of human alk-SMase. The enzyme recognizes PC, the head group of SM, via an NPP7-specific aromatic box composed of tyrosine residues. Structural and functional analysis identified features on the surface of the protein essential for accessing SM in bile salt micelles. We determined the 2.4 Å-resolution crystal structure of human alk-SMase. The crystallized construct (residues 22–433) excludes the N-terminal signal peptide and the C-terminal transmembrane segment, which normally anchors the protein on the luminal side of the intestinal microvillar membrane but which can be cleaved off by pancreatic trypsin (5Wu J. Liu F. Nilsson A. Duan R.D. Pancreatic trypsin cleaves intestinal alkaline sphingomyelinase from mucosa and enhances the sphingomyelinase activity.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2004; 287: G967-G973Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Residues 30–417 of the construct are visible in the electron density, whereas residues 418–433 are disordered; thus the region from residues 414 to 440 likely constitutes a flexible linker of low sequence conservation between the catalytic domain and the C-terminal transmembrane helix. alk-SMase is composed of a catalytic domain with a “cap” subdomain (Fig. 1A). The core of the catalytic domain is an eight-stranded mixed β-sheet flanked by α-helices on both faces. This α-β-α architecture is characteristic of the alkaline phosphatase superfamily (CATH database code 3.40.720.10). The cap subdomain comprises residues 251–350 and consists of a four-stranded antiparallel β-sheet surrounded mainly by loop segments and a small α-helix. It is packed against one helical side of the catalytic domain, forming a 1,500 Å2 interface. This cap insertion is specific to the NPP family (PFAM code PF00245), which is subdivided into two groups: the single-domain proteins NPP4–7 and the larger members NPP1–3 that contain an additional nuclease-like domain and two somatomedin B-like units (11Zimmermann H.

Rep. 2016; 6: 20995Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) are known. Despite the rather low sequence identity of ∼30% between alk-SMase and the other NPPs, secondary structure elements are overall conserved (Fig. 1B). alk-SMase contains no disulfide bonds and possesses five N-linked glycosylation sites, all required for full activity (25Wu J. Hansen G.H. Nilsson A. Duan R.D. Functional studies of human intestinal alkaline sphingomyelinase by deglycosylation and mutagenesis.Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and visible in the structure (Fig. 1A), three of which are located on the face of the enzyme harboring the active site. A depression on the catalytic domain surface encloses two zinc ions held by the side chains of seven residues (Fig. 1C). Zn1 is coordinated by His-353, His-203, and Asp-199 (bidentate), whereas Zn2 is coordinated by His-247, Asp-246, Asp-39 (bidentate), and Thr-75. The catalytic machinery is conserved within the NPP family (Fig. 1D), so the proposed reaction mechanism for these enzymes (26Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Structural and catalytic similarities between nucleotide pyrophosphatases/phosphodiesterases and alkaline phosphatases.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1361-1368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) likely also applies to the cleavage of SM into ceramide and PC by alk-SMase. SM would bind with its phosphate moiety positioned at the zinc ions and undergo a nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom by the side chain hydroxyl of Thr-75 activated by Zn2. Departure of the ceramide leaving group results in a covalent phosphocholyl-threonine intermediate. Subsequent nucleophilic attack on this intermediate by a water molecule activated by Zn1 then re-forms Thr-75 and releases PC. Although we could not obtain a structure of alk-SMase bound to SM, we determined the structure of the enzyme in complex with the lipid head group and reaction product, PC. The molecule is found in the active site with its phosphate moiety positioned at the zinc ions and its choline portion extending sideways into the active site cavity (Fig. 2A). In addition to the strong zinc-phosphate electrostatic interactions, one phosphate oxygen atom is hydrogen-bonded to the side chains of Asn-96, a contact conserved in NPPs, and Tyr-280, specific to alk-SMase (Fig. 2B). The choline quaternary ammonium group forms cation-π interactions with two aromatic side chains oriented perpendicularly to it, Tyr-166 and Tyr-109 (Fig. 2C). Such an arrangement of aromatic residues forming a cation-π “box” is a common choline-binding motif (27Cheng J. Goldstein R. Gershenson A. Stec B. Roberts M.F. The cation-π box is a specific phosphatidylcholine membrane targeting motif.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 14863-14873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). No changes in the protein itself were observed in the PC-bound structure relative to the apo form. To validate this SM head group recognition mechanism, in vitro enzymatic activity of purified alk-SMase mutants Y109L and Y166L was assayed. These mutants were designed to minimize structural disruption of the protein while removing the aromatic box. The substrates tested were SM, the PC-containing small molecule p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine (NPPC), and the generic phosphodiesterase substrate bis(4-nitrophenyl) phosphate (bNPP). Both mutants decreased the hydrolysis rate of SM and NPPC 5–10-fold, whereas the activity on bNPP (not PC-based) varied depending on the mutation, although it was 17–24-fold slower than PC-based substrates (Fig. 2D). NPPs were initially identified as nucleotide phosphodiesterases, but their catalytic repertoire has subsequently been expanded. NTPs, NDPs, dinucleoside polyphosphates, and possibly related molecules such as NAD+ and nucleotide sugars are the major substrates for NPP1, NPP3, and NPP4 (11Zimmermann H. Zebisch M. Sträter N.

This amino acid is replaced by a glutamate in alk-SMase (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, other substitutions in surrounding residues sterically prevent positioning of the nucleobase; indeed, alk-SMase is inactive on p-nitrophenyl-TMP (6Duan R.D. Bergman T. Xu N. Wu J. Cheng Y. Duan J. Nelander S. Palmberg C. Nilsson A. Identification of human intestinal alkaline sphingomyelinase as a novel ecto-enzyme related to the nucleotide phosphodiesterase family.J. Biol.

On the other hand, NPP2 (autotaxin) and NPP6 can hydrolyze choline-based phospholipids including lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingosylphosphorylcholine, platelet-activating factor, and the small metabolite glycerophosphocholine (11Zimmermann H. Zebisch M. Sträter N. Cellular function and molecular structure of ecto-nucleotidases.Purinergic Signal. 2012; 8: 437-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar, 14Nishimasu H. Okudaira S.

Rep. 2016; 6: 20995Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, their substrate recognition modes are distinct from that of alk-SMase. NPP6 interacts with choline moieties via an aromatic box assisted by an anionic side chain (16Morita J. Kano K. Kato K. Takita H. Sakagami H. Yamamoto Y. Mihara E. Ueda H. Sato T. Tokuyama H. Arai H. Asou H. Takagi J. Ishitani R. Nishimasu H. et al.Structure and biological function of ENPP6, a choline-specific glycerophosphodiester-phosphodiesterase.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6: 20995Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); however, an entirely different set of tyrosine residues is involved, not conserved in alk-SMase (Fig. 2F). NPP2 is a phospholipase D, generating lysophosphatidic acid and choline, whereas alk-SMase is a phospholipase C, cleaving the reverse phosphoester bond. NPP2 accommodates the acyl chain of lysophosphatidylcholine inside a hydrophobic tunnel (14Nishimasu H. Okudaira S. Hama K. Mihara E. Dohmae N. Inoue A. Ishitani R. Takagi J. Aoki J. Nureki O. Crystal structure of autotaxin and insight into GPCR activation by lipid mediators.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), a feature absent from alk-SMase. Therefore, substrates bind to alk-SMase and NPP2 with their head groups in opposite directions (Fig. 2G) to preserve the position of the scissile bond. In summary, the structural and functional data shows that alk-SMase recognizes its SM substrate via an NPP7-specific (Fig. 2H) cation-π box. alk-SMase is uniquely dependent on bile salts for activity (2Duan R.D. Alkaline sphingomyelinase: an old enzyme with novel implications.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar); other detergents such as CHAPS and Triton X-100 are not stimulatory or even inhibit the protein (3Duan R.D. Cheng Y. Hansen G. Hertervig E. Liu J.J. Syk I. Sjostrom H. Nilsson A. Purification, localization, and expression of human intestinal alkaline sphingomyelinase.J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1241-1250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This feature raised the possibility that bile salts may exert a specific stimulatory effect on the enzyme beyond their lipid-solubilizing role, perhaps by directly interacting with the protein (2Duan R.D. Alkaline sphingomyelinase: an old enzyme with novel implications.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To assess this, in vitro enzymatic activity of purified alk-SMase on the non-lipid substrates bNPP and NPPC, which would not rely on bile salts for solubility, was tested in the absence or presence of TC, a common bile salt (Fig. 3A). No stimulation was observed (Fig. 3A) with TC at concentrations below (1 mm) or above (10 mm) its critical micelle concentration of ∼3.2 mm (28Carey M.C. Small D.M. Micelle formation by bile salts: physical-chemical and thermodynamic considerations.Arch. Intern. Med. 1972; 130: 506-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) in this experimental system. This result suggests that bile salts do not directly stimulate catalysis by the enzyme. Examination of the face of alk-SMase that harbors the active site reveals a mostly positively charged surface (Fig. 3B), a feature that would favor association of the enzyme with anionic bile salt micelles. In addition, a loop (residues 342–351) bearing three solvent-exposed hydrophobic residues is located near the substrate-binding site (Fig. 3C), which could be important for interacting with micellar lipids. This segment is specific to alk-SMase, because its sequence greatly diverges within the NPPs (Fig. 3D). We tested the functional importance of these elements by mutating the hydrophobic loop (Ile-344 + Val-346 + Phe-348), as well as two nearby surface cationic patches (Lys-167 + Arg-204 and Arg-271 + Arg-343; Fig. 3C) and assaying cleavage of SM in anionic TC micelles (Fig. 3E, black bars). Hydrolysis of the non-lipid substrates bNPP and NPPC are largely unaffected by the mutations (Fig. 3F), indicating that the catalytic ability of the protein was not disrupted. Substitution of Lys-167 + Arg-204 had no effect on SM hydrolysis, whereas replacement of Arg-271 + Arg-343 by glutamates decreased activity, suggesting that this patch is located near the micelle adsorption area. The corresponding alanine mutant did not impair SM cleavage, however, indicating that electrostatic interaction of Arg-271 + Arg-343 with the micelle is dispensable for this process. Interestingly, substitution of the three hydrophobic loop residues by glutamates or asparagines abolished SM cleavage, positing this loop as essential for alk-SMase function. Solubilization of lipids by bile salts results in micelles of markedly different properties than those formed by bile salts alone. In the latter case, micelles are small and composed of 2–10 monomers (28Carey M.C. Small D.M. Micelle formation by bile salts: physical-chemical and thermodynamic considerations.Arch. Intern. Med. 1972; 130: 506-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Presumably, the sta"
https://openalex.org/W2617794007,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the top ten most common forms of cancer and is the most common malignancy of the kidney. Clear cell renal carcinoma (cc-RCC), the most common type of RCC, is one of the most refractory cancers with an incidence that is on the rise. Screening of plant extracts in search of new anti-cancer agents resulted in the discovery of englerin A, a guaiane sesquiterpene with potent cytotoxicity against renal cancer cells and a small subset of other cancer cells. Though a few cellular targets have been identified for englerin A, it is still not clear what mechanisms account for the cytotoxicity of englerin A in RCC, which occurs at concentrations well below those used to engage the targets previously identified. Unlike any prior study, the current study used a systems biology approach to explore the mechanism(s) of action of englerin A. Metabolomics analyses indicated that englerin A profoundly altered lipid metabolism by 24 h in cc-RCC cell lines and generated significant levels of ceramides that were highly toxic to these cells. Microarray analyses determined that englerin A induced ER stress signaling and an acute inflammatory response, which was confirmed by quantitative PCR and Western Blot analyses. Additionally, fluorescence confocal microscopy revealed that englerin A at 25 nM disrupted the morphology of the ER confirming the deleterious effect of englerin A on the ER. Collectively, our findings suggest that cc-RCC is highly sensitive to disruptions in lipid metabolism and ER stress and that these vulnerabilities can be targeted for the treatment of cc-RCC and possibly other lipid storing cancers. Furthermore, our results suggest that ceramides may be a mediator of some of the actions of englerin A. Lastly, the acute inflammatory response induced by englerin A may mediate anti-tumor immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2631621965,"The cassava mealybug is a clear and present threat to the food security and livelihoods of some of the world's most impoverished citizens. Niche models, such as CLIMEX, are useful tools to indicate where and when such threats may extend, and can assist with planning for biosecurity and the management of pest invasions. They can also contribute to bioeconomic analyses that underpin the allocation of resources to alleviate poverty. Because species can invade and establish in areas with climates that are different from those that are found in their native range, it is essential to define robust range-limiting mechanisms in niche models. To avoid spurious results when applied to novel climates, it is necessary to employ cross-validation techniques spanning different knowledge domains (e.g., distribution data, experimental results, phenological observations). We build upon and update a CLIMEX niche model by Parsa et al. (PloS ONE 7: e47675), correcting inconsistent parameters and re-fitting it based on a careful examination of geographical distribution data and relevant literature. Further, we consider the role of irrigation, the known distribution of cassava production and a targeted review of satellite imagery to refine, validate and interpret our model and results. In so doing, we bring new insights into the potential spread of this invasive insect, enabling us to identify potential bio-security threats and biological control opportunities. The fit of the revised model is improved, particularly in relation to the wet and dry limits to establishment, and the parameter values are biologically plausible and accord with published scientific literature."
https://openalex.org/W2604126839,"Objective To examine the independent contribution of individual, community and state-level factors to health care service utilization for children with acute childhood illnesses in Nigeria. Materials and methods The study was based on secondary analyses of cross-sectional population-based data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). Multilevel logistic regression models were applied to the data on 6,427 under-five children who used or did not use health care service when they were sick (level 1), nested within 896 communities (level 2) from 37 states (level 3). Results About one-quarter of the mothers were between 15 and 24 years old and almost half of them did not have formal education (47%). While only 30% of the children utilized health service when they were sick, close to 67% lived in the rural area. In the fully adjusted model, mothers with higher education attainment (Adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.63; 95% credible interval [CrI] = 1.31–2.03), from rich households (aOR = 1.76; 95% CrI = 1.35–2.25), with access to media (radio, television or magazine) (aOR = 1.18; 95% CrI = 1.08–1.29), and engaging in employment (aOR = 1.18; 95% CrI = 1.02–1.37) were significantly more likely to have used healthcare services for acute childhood illnesses. On the other hand, women who experienced difficulty getting to health facilities (aOR = 0.87; 95% CrI = 0.75–0.99) were less likely to have used health service for their children. Conclusions Our findings highlight that utilization of healthcare service for acute childhood illnesses was influenced by not only maternal factors but also community-level factors, suggesting that public health strategies should recognise this complex web of individual composition and contextual composition factors to guide provision of healthcare services. Such interventions could include: increase in female school enrolment, provision of interest-free loans for small and medium scale enterprises, introduction of mobile clinics and establishment of more primary health care centres."
https://openalex.org/W2600749459,"The activity of the E3 ligase, SMURF2, is antagonized by an intramolecular, autoinhibitory interaction between its C2 and Hect domains. Relief of SMURF2 autoinhibition is induced by TGFβ and is mediated by the inhibitory SMAD, SMAD7. In a proteomic screen for endomembrane interactants of the RING-domain E3 ligase, RNF11, we identified SMURF2, among a cohort of Hect E3 ligases previously implicated in TGFβ signaling. Reconstitution of the SMURF2·RNF11 complex in vitro unexpectedly revealed robust SMURF2 E3 ligase activity, with biochemical properties previously restricted to the SMURF2·SMAD7 complex. Using in vitro binding assays, we find that RNF11 can directly compete with SMAD7 for SMURF2 and that binding is mutually exclusive and dependent on a proline-rich domain. Moreover, we found that co-expression of RNF11 and SMURF2 dramatically reduced SMURF2 ubiquitylation in the cell. This effect is strictly dependent on complex formation and sorting determinants that regulate the association of RNF11 with membranes. RNF11 is overexpressed in certain tumors, and, importantly, we found that depletion of this protein down-regulated gene expression of several TGFβ-responsive genes, dampened cell proliferation, and dramatically reduced cell migration in response to TGFβ. Our data suggest for the first time that the choice of binding partners for SMURF2 can sustain or repress TGFβ signaling, and RNF11 may promote TGFβ-induced cell migration."
https://openalex.org/W2717249886,"Objective Using a specific cutoff of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) to screen gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) can reduce the use of oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). Since the prevalence of GDM increases with age, this screening method may not be appropriate in healthcare systems where women become pregnant at older ages. Therefore, we aimed to develop a screening algorithm for GDM that takes maternal age into consideration. Methods We included 945 pregnant women without history of GDM who received 75g OGTT to diagnose GDM in 2011. Screening algorithms using FPG with or without age were developed. Another 362 pregnant women were recruited in 2013–2015 as the validation cohort. Results Using FPG criteria alone, more GDM diagnoses were missed in women ≥35 years than in women <35 years (13.2% vs. 5.8%, p <0.001). Among GDM women ≥35 years, 63.6% had FPG <92 mg/dL (5.1 mmol/L). Use of the algorithm with an “age plus FPG” cutoff could reduce the use of OGTT (OGTT%) from 77.6% to 62.9%, while maintaining good sensitivity (from 91.9% to 90.2%) and specificity (from 100% to 100%). Similar reduction in OGTT% was found in the validation cohort (from 86.4% to 76.8%). In the simulation, if the percentage of women ≥35 years were 40% or more, the screening algorithm with an “age plus FPG” cutoff could further reduce OGTT% by 11.0%-18.8%. Conclusions A screening algorithm for GDM that takes maternal age into consideration can reduce the use of OGTT when women become pregnant at older ages."
https://openalex.org/W2596975903,"Lon protease previously has been shown to interact with DNA, but the role of this interaction for Lon proteolytic activity has not been characterized. In this study, we used truncated Escherichia coli Lon constructs, bioinformatics analysis, and site-directed mutagenesis to identify Lon domains and residues crucial for Lon binding with DNA and effects on Lon proteolytic activity. We found that deletion of Lon's ATPase domain abrogated interactions with DNA. Substitution of positively charged amino acids in this domain in full-length Lon with residues conferring a net negative charge disrupted binding of Lon to DNA. These changes also affected the degradation of nucleic acid-binding protein substrates of Lon, intracellular localization of Lon, and cell morphology. In vivo tests revealed that Lon-DNA interactions are essential for Lon activity in cell division control. In summary, we demonstrate that the ability of Lon to bind DNA is determined by its ATPase domain, that this binding is required for processing protein substrates in nucleoprotein complexes, and that Lon may help regulate DNA replication in response to growth conditions."

However, the general toxicity and structural complexity of bafilomycins present formidable challenges to drug design via chemical modification, prompting interests in improving bafilomycin activities via biosynthetic approaches. Two bafilomycin biosynthetic gene clusters have been identified, but their post-polyketide synthase (PKS) tailoring steps for structural diversification and bioactivity improvement remain largely unknown. In this study, the post-PKS tailoring pathway from bafilomycin A1 (1)→C1 (2)→B1 (3) in the marine microorganism Streptomyces lohii was elucidated for the first time by in vivo gene inactivation and in vitro biochemical characterization. We found that fumarate is first adenylated by a novel fumarate adenylyltransferase Orf3. Then, the fumaryl transferase Orf2 is responsible for transferring the fumarate moiety from fumaryl-AMP to the 21-hydroxyl group of 1 to generate 2.

For example, bafilomycin A1 (1), C1 (2), and B1 (3) were first isolated from Streptomyces griseus sp. sulfurus (TÜ 1922) in 1983 (7Werner G. Hagenmaier H. Albert K. Kohlshorn H.

Among these natural bafilomycin derivatives, 1 is of particular importance because it is the structural core of all bafilomycins. This compound has been characterized to be a specific inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which has been known as an important drug target for both osteoporosis and tumor metastasis (6Bowman E.J.

However, the high toxicity of 1 prevents it from clinical application (14Dröse S. Altendorf K. Bafilomycins and concanamycins as inhibitors of V-ATPases and P-ATPases.J. Exp.

One important reason is that the structural complexity (multiple chiral centers and many functional groups with similar reactivity) of bafilomycins largely limits the extensive chemical modification of their structures to explore more comprehensive structure-activity relationship. The existence of dozens of natural bafilomycin derivatives, together with the recent success of using a sugar-O-methyltransferase (LeuA) and a glycosyltransferase (LeuB) to decorate the structure of 1 (19Wu C. Medema M.H. Läkamp R.M. Zhang L. Dorrestein P.C. Choi Y.H. van Wezel G.P. Leucanicidin and endophenasides result from methyl-rhamnosylation by the same tailoring enzymes in Kitasatospora sp.

Sci. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). To take advantage of the highly selective and eco-friendly biocatalysts to generate novel bafilomycin analogues for drug development, it is demanded to elucidate the bafilomycin biosynthetic pathway and understand the characteristics of all tailoring enzymes. In previous studies (20Zhang W. Fortman J.L. Carlson J.C. Yan J. Liu Y. Bai F. Guan W. Jia J. Matainaho T. Sherman D.H. Li S.

Nam D.H. Organization and characterization of a biosynthetic gene cluster for bafilomycin from Streptomyces griseus DSM 2608.AMB Express. 2013; 3: 24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our laboratory and others have identified two bafilomycin biosynthetic gene clusters from Streptomyces lohii ATCC BAA-1276 and S. griseus DSM 2608, respectively. As proposed, 1 is assembled by five type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) 2The abbreviations used are: PKSpolyketide synthaseC5N2-amino-3-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone5-ALA5-aminolevulinic acidPPipyrophosphatePimonophosphateTCAtricarboxylic acidLC-HRMSliquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. (BafAI-AV) sequentially. Subsequently, a fumarate moiety is transferred to the C21-hydoxyl group of 1 to afford 2. Finally, the 2-amino-3-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone (C5N) unit derived from glycine and succinyl-CoA is linked to the fumarate moiety via an amide bond giving rise to 3 (Fig. 1). However, all these putative biosynthetic steps lack of experimental evidence and the responsible enzymes remain largely unknown. The only exception is that we identified BafZ to be a 5-aminolevulinate (5-ALA) synthase in a previous study (20Zhang W. Fortman J.L. Carlson J.C. Yan J. Liu Y. Bai F. Guan W. Jia J. Matainaho T. Sherman D.H. Li S. Characterization of the bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lohii.ChemBioChem. 2013; 14: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). polyketide synthase 2-amino-3-hydroxycyclopent-2-enone 5-aminolevulinic acid pyrophosphate monophosphate tricarboxylic acid liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. Herein, we elucidate the complete post-PKS tailoring steps of bafilomycin biosynthetic pathway for the first time through in vivo gene inactivation and in vitro reconstitution of enzyme activities. Biochemically, Orf3 is characterized as a novel fumarate adenylyltransferase showing a substrate preference for fumarate over a variety of other short chain organic acids; Orf2 with high substrate specificity is responsible for transferring the fumarate moiety from fumaryl-AMP to 1, giving rise to 2; BafX and BafZ cooperatively synthesize the C5N unit, and BafY catalyzes the amide bond formation between 2 and C5N, finishing the bafilomycin biosynthetic pathway of S. lohii. In our previous study (20Zhang W. Fortman J.L. Carlson J.C. Yan J. Liu Y. Bai F. Guan W. Jia J. Matainaho T. Sherman D.H. Li S. Characterization of the bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lohii.ChemBioChem. 2013; 14: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), because we did not identify any apparent candidate ORFs that could encode an enzyme mediating the attachment of fumarate moiety, it was surmised that BafY might be a bifunctional enzyme, which not only mediates the fumarate attachment via an ester bond formation (1→2), but also catalyzes the amide bond formation between 2 and C5N (2→3). To test this hypothesis, the suicide knock-out vector pCIMt002-ΔbafY was constructed and used to transform S. lohii by interspecies conjugation to replace bafY in-frame with the apramycin resistance gene aac(IV) by following the protocol of Chen et al. (22Li P. Li J. Guo Z. Tang W. Han J. Meng X. Hao T. Zhu Y. Zhang L. Chen Y. An efficient blue-white screening based gene inactivation system for Streptomyces.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2015; 99: 1923-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A), the double-crossover mutants with bafY removed were readily screened by picking up white colonies from blue colonies indicative of undesired single-crossover mutants. After PCR confirmation of the genotype (supplemental Fig. S1B), the bafY inactivation mutant (ΔbafY) was cultured in parallel with the wild-type strain. Unexpectedly, the mutant strain ΔbafY only lost the ability to produce 3 (Fig. 2, trace i and ii), strongly suggesting that BafY should only be involved in the transformation from 2 to 3, but unrelated to the fumarate transferring step. Generally, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of a given Streptomyces secondary metabolite are organized in a gene cluster. To find out the enzyme responsible for the initial tailoring step, we reanalyzed the baf gene cluster (Fig. 1A) with the GenBank accession number of GU390405.1, and located two uncharacterized genes including orf2 and orf3 at the 3′ end of this cluster, which were previously proposed to encode a malonyl transferase and a CoA ligase, respectively, simply based on bioinformatics analysis (20Zhang W. Fortman J.L. Carlson J.C. Yan J. Liu Y. Bai F. Guan W. Jia J. Matainaho T. Sherman D.H. Li S. Characterization of the bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lohii.ChemBioChem. 2013; 14: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Hwang J.Y. Kim H.S. Kim S.H. Oh H.R. Nam D.H. Organization and characterization of a biosynthetic gene cluster for bafilomycin from Streptomyces griseus DSM 2608.AMB Express. 2013; 3: 24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the transformation from 1 to 2 likely requires a transferase activity, we hypothesize that Orf3 could activate fumarate by ligating a CoA moiety, and Orf2 might be responsible for transferring the fumaryl group to the C21 hydroxyl group of 1. Orf1 is homologous to the LuxR-family transcription regulator, therefore, it is unlikely to be an enzyme. Thus, we in-frame replaced the orf2 plus orf3 region with aac(IV) (supplemental Fig. S1C). The mutant stain Δorf2&3 only produced 1 (Fig. 2, trace iii) without any accumulation of 2 and 3. This result indicates that Orf2 and/or Orf3 are required for the initial tailoring of 1. However, their exact functionality requires further biochemical investigation (see below). To characterize the in vitro activity of Orf2, Orf3, BafX, BafY, and BafZ, and reconstitute the entire bafilomycin post-PKS tailoring pathway, the coding sequences of the four genes (except bafZ that was cloned previously (20Zhang W. Fortman J.L. Carlson J.C. Yan J. Liu Y. Bai F. Guan W. Jia J. Matainaho T. Sherman D.H. Li S. Characterization of the bafilomycin biosynthetic gene cluster from Streptomyces lohii.ChemBioChem. 2013; 14: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)) were PCR amplified and inserted into the pET28b vector, respectively. The recombinant proteins of Orf2, BafX, BafY, and BafZ with the N-terminal His6 tag were successfully overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Fig. 3A). However, the recombinant Orf3 turned out to form inclusion bodies. Significant efforts, including optimization of expression conditions, making different expression constructs, use of molecular chaperones, and different E. coli host cells carrying extra rare codon tRNA genes, failed to solve the problem of insolubility (data not shown). This led to a reconsideration of the orf3 annotation. Careful BLAST analysis of Orf3 and its homologous proteins revealed that several putative proteins, such as BafCI from S. griseus DSM 2608 (21Hwang J.Y. Kim H.S. Kim S.H. Oh H.R. Nam D.H. Organization and characterization of a biosynthetic gene cluster for bafilomycin from Streptomyces griseus DSM 2608.AMB Express. 2013; 3: 24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with >90% protein sequence identity to Orf3, have approximately 20 more amino acids at the N terminus compared with the original Orf3 (supplemental Fig. S2). This finding suggests that orf3 is likely to be mis-annotated previously, and the N-terminal truncation is probably the reason for the insolubility of Orf3. Re-inspection of the 5′ upstream sequence of orf3 resulted in the discovery of another possible start codon, which is 81 bp upstream of the previously assigned start codon. Interestingly, this GTG start codon overlaps with the TGA stop codon of Orf2 (Fig. 3B), which suggests Orf2 and Orf3 are likely to be co-transcribed, co-translated, and functionally related. When the re-annotated orf3 was cloned into pET28b and expressed, Orf3 became soluble and was successfully purified by His tag affinity chromatography (Fig. 3A). Gel filtration results indicated that Orf3, BafX, and BafZ predominantly dimerize in solution, whereas Orf2 and BafY form monomers (supplemental Fig. S3). According to the in vivo orf2&3 knock-out result (Fig. 2) and the fact that these two genes overlap each other, Orf2 and Orf3 are likely co-responsible for the transformation from 1 to 2. To dissect their catalytic activities, we decided to investigate these two enzymes separately. We and others previously assigned Orf3 to be a putative CoA-ligase based on BLAST searches (20Zhang W. Fortman J.L. Carlson J.C. Yan J. Liu Y. Bai F. Guan W. Jia J. Matainaho T. Sherman D.H. Li S.

In this study, more detailed bioinformatics analysis found that the protein sequence of Orf3 shows >30% identity with a number of identified arylcarboxylate adenylating enzymes including GriC (23Suzuki H. Ohnishi Y. Horinouchi S. GriC and GriD constitute a carboxylic acid reductase involved in grixazone biosynthesis in Streptomyces griseus.J.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 664-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Protein sequence alignment of these enzymes (supplemental Fig. S4) revealed that Orf3 exhibits many hallmarks as a typical adenylating enzyme of the ANL family, which includes CoA ligases, adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and firefly luciferase (26Gulick A.M. Conformational dynamics in the acyl-CoA synthetases, adenylation domains of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, and firefly luciferase.ACS Chem.

The carboxyl group of Asp327 may coordinate with the 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups of the nucleotide sugar. Residues 97SGGTTGTP104 of Orf3 likely forms the p-loop (phosphate-binding loop) that is a conserved motif in many ATP-binding enzymes (26Gulick A.M.

Biol. 2009; 4: 811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The substrate-binding pocket analogous to EphF is also present in Orf3: the conserved stretches of 259YGNT262 and 145HLIG148 are expected to be involved in substrate binding, whereas several arginine residues including Arg121, Arg122, Arg127, and Arg152 might make polar contacts with the carboxylate group of fumarate (24Rui Z. Ye M. Wang S. Fujikawa K. Akerele B. Aung M. Floss H.G. Zhang W. Yu T.-W. Insights into a divergent phenazine biosynthetic pathway governed by a plasmid-born esmeraldin gene cluster.Chem. Biol. 2012; 19: 1116-1125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Importantly, there does not exist any CoA-binding sites in the protein sequence of Orf3, which suggests this enzyme is more likely to be a fumarate adenylyltransferase rather than a fumaryl-CoA ligase. To test the in vitro activity of Orf3, the reaction mixture containing 10 μm Orf3, 5 mm disodium fumarate, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.4 units/ml of inorganic pyrophosphatase in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, was initiated by adding 5 mm ATP. Upon a 15-min incubation at 28 °C, 32.0 ± 0.5 μm phosphate (Pi) released from pyrophosphate (PPi) by pyrophosphatase was detected using the malachite green phosphate assay (Fig. 4A), corresponding to presumable formation of 16.0 μm fumaryl-AMP (29McQuade T.J. Shallop A.D. Sheoran A. Delproposto J.E. Tsodikov O.V. Garneau-Tsodikova S. A nonradioactive high-throughput assay for screening and characterization of adenylation domains for nonribosomal peptide combinatorial biosynthesis.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 386: 244-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), which is impractical to be purified because of the high instability. Indeed, AMP (presumably derived from spontaneous hydrolysis of fumaryl-AMP) instead of fumaryl-AMP was detected in an Orf3 reaction mixture (supplemental Fig. S5). According to previous study (30Rusnak F. Faraci W.S. Walsh C.T. Subcloning, expression, and purification of the enterobactin biosynthetic enzyme 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate-AMP ligase: demonstration of enzyme-bound (2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)adenylate product.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6827-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the low turnover number is likely due to the slow release of fumaryl-AMP from Orf3 when the downstream acceptor enzyme is absent. Notably, no significant monophosphate release was observed when pyrophosphatase or disodium fumarate was omitted in the assay (Fig. 4A), suggesting that Pi was solely derived from PPi as the co-product of fumaryl-AMP. To determine the substrate specificity of Orf3, a select group of organic acids including malonate, succinate, butyrate, maleate, and glutarate were kinetically evaluated using fumarate as control (Table 1, supplemental Fig. S6-S10). As expected, Orf3 showed a strong substrate preference toward fumarate with the kcat/Km value of 59.4 × 10−3 mm−1 min−1. Succinate was determined to be the suboptimal substrate (kcat/Km = 3.9 × 10−3 mm−1 min−1) perhaps due to its high structural similarity to fumarate. Malonate, glutarate, maleate, and butyrate were all poor substrates, suggesting that the carbon chain length, the configuration of the C=C double bond, and the dicarboxylic acid feature are crucial for substrate recognition of Orf3. Collectively, Orf3 is a novel fumarate adenylyltransferase.Table 1Steady-state kinetic parameters of Orf3 toward different substratesSubstrateKmkcat × 10−2kcat/Km× 10−3mmmin−1mm−1 min−1Fumarate3.2 ± 0.619.0 ± 1.059.4Succinate19.2 ± 2.27.5 ± 0.33.9Malonate24.1 ± 3.84.4 ± 0.31.8Glutarate32.5 ± 8.73.4 ± 0.41.0Maleate29.7 ± 4.93.5 ± 0.21.2ButyrateNDaND, not determined due to extremely low activity.NDNDa ND, not determined due to extremely low activity. Open table in a new tab Because fumaryl-AMP is the product of Orf3, we hypothesized that 1 and fumaryl-AMP could be co-substrates for the transferase Orf2. Thus, the in vitro transformation from 1 to 2 was set up to contain 10 μm Orf2 and Orf3, 80 μm 1, 5 mm disodium fumarate, 5 mm ATP, and 10 mm MgCl2 in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Upon an incubation at 28 °C for 4 h, 83.1 ± 3.2% (calculated from substrate consumption) of 1 was converted into 2 (Fig. 5, trace ii). This result clearly indicates that Orf2 and Orf3 cooperatively synthesize 2. Moreover, it was proven that Orf3 is not a fumaryl-CoA ligase as previously proposed (20Zhang W. Fortman J.L. Carlson J.C. Yan J. Liu Y. Bai F. Guan W. Jia J. Matainaho T. Sherman D.H. Li S.

Next, we assessed the substrate specificity of Orf2 by determining if this enzyme is capable of incorporating alternative organic acids into the bafilomycin macrolactone scaffold. In the same assay (see above) using Orf2 and Orf3 as biocatalysts, fumarate was substituted by malonate, succinate, butyrate, maleate, or glutarate. As results, except for a small amount (2.2 ± 0.1% conversion rate) of succinyl derivative (4) (Figs. 1D and 5, trace iii, supplemental Fig. S11 and Table S1), no other derivatives were detected by LC-HRMS. Enhanced amounts of Orf2/Orf3, increased concentrations of alternative organic acids, and prolonged reaction time did not generate any detectable novel bafilomycin derivatives (data not shown). Because Orf3 is able to convert all these acids into corresponding adenylated intermediates in varying efficiency (Table 1), we deduce that Orf2 should be a strict fumaryl transferase with marginal succinyl transferase activity. The in vivo inactivation of bafY led to accumulation of 2 (Fig. 2, trace ii), which strongly suggests that BafY is involved in the final step of bafilomycin biosynthesis (Fig. 1D). According to bioinformatics analysis (supplemental Fig. S12), BafY is proposed as an ATP-dependent amide synthetase because it shows >41/56% protein sequence identity/similarity to several identified ATP-dependent amide synthetases including MoeB4 (31Ostash B.

https://openalex.org/W2668534511,"Introduction Publishing protocols of randomized controlled trials (RCT) facilitates a more detailed description of study rational, design, and related ethical and safety issues, which should promote transparency. Little is known about how the practice of publishing protocols developed over time. Therefore, this study describes the worldwide trends in volume and methodological quality of published RCT protocols. Methods A systematic search was performed in PubMed and EMBASE, identifying RCT protocols published over a decade from 1 September 2001. Data were extracted on quality characteristics of RCT protocols. The primary outcome, methodological quality, was assessed by individual methodological characteristics (adequate generation of allocation, concealment of allocation and intention-to-treat analysis). A comparison was made by publication period (First, September 2001- December 2004; Second, January 2005-May 2008; Third, June 2008-September 2011), geographical region and medical specialty. Results The number of published RCT protocols increased from 69 in the first, to 390 in the third period (p<0.0001). Internal medicine and paediatrics were the most common specialty topics. Whereas most published RCT protocols in the first period originated from North America (n = 30, 44%), in the second and third period this was Europe (respectively, n = 65, 47% and n = 190, 48%, p = 0.02). Quality of RCT protocols was higher in Europe and Australasia, compared to North America (OR = 0.63, CI = 0.40–0.99, p = 0.04). Adequate generation of allocation improved with time (44%, 58%, 67%, p = 0.001), as did concealment of allocation (38%, 53%, 55%, p = 0.03). Surgical protocols had the highest quality among the three specialty topics used in this study (OR = 1.94, CI = 1.09–3.45, p = 0.02). Conclusion Publishing RCT protocols has become popular, with a five-fold increase in the past decade. The quality of published RCT protocols also improved, although variation between geographical regions and across medical specialties was seen. This emphasizes the importance of international standards of comprehensive training in RCT methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2668911228,"The discovery of insulin led to a revolution in diabetes management. Since then, many improvements have been introduced to insulin preparations. The availability of molecular genetic techniques has enabled the creation of insulin analogs by changing the structure of the native protein in order to improve the therapeutic properties. A new expression vector pIBAINS for production of four recombinant human insulin (INS) analogs (GKR, GEKR, AKR, SR) was constructed and overexpressed in the new E. coli 20 strain as a fusion protein with modified human superoxide dismutase (SOD). The SOD gene was used as a signal peptide to enhance the expression of insulin. SOD::INS was manufactured in the form of insoluble inclusion bodies. After cleavage of the fusion protein with trypsin, the released insulin analogs were refolded and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Elongation of chain A, described here for the first time, considerably improved the stability of the selected analogs. Their identity was confirmed with mass spectrometric techniques. The biological activity of the insulin derivatives was tested on rats with experimental diabetes. The obtained results proved that the new analogs described in this paper have the potential to generate prolonged hypoglycemic activity and may allow for even less frequent subcutaneous administration than once-a-day. When applied, all the analogs demonstrate a rapid onset of action. Such a combination renders the proposed biosynthetic insulin unique among already known related formulations."
https://openalex.org/W2677853559,"Decompression sickness (DCS), which is caused by inert gas bubbles in tissues, is an injury of concern for scuba divers, compressed air workers, astronauts, and aviators. Case reports for 3322 air and N2-O2 dives, resulting in 190 DCS events, were retrospectively analyzed and the outcomes were scored as (1) serious neurological, (2) cardiopulmonary, (3) mild neurological, (4) pain, (5) lymphatic or skin, and (6) constitutional or nonspecific manifestations. Following standard U.S. Navy medical definitions, the data were grouped into mild-Type I (manifestations 4-6)-and serious-Type II (manifestations 1-3). Additionally, we considered an alternative grouping of mild-Type A (manifestations 3-6)-and serious-Type B (manifestations 1 and 2). The current U.S. Navy guidance allows for a 2% probability of mild DCS and a 0.1% probability of serious DCS. We developed a hierarchical trinomial (3-state) probabilistic DCS model that simultaneously predicts the probability of mild and serious DCS given a dive exposure. Both the Type I/II and Type A/B discriminations of mild and serious DCS resulted in a highly significant (p << 0.01) improvement in trinomial model fit over the binomial (2-state) model. With the Type I/II definition, we found that the predicted probability of 'mild' DCS resulted in a longer allowable bottom time for the same 2% limit. However, for the 0.1% serious DCS limit, we found a vastly decreased allowable bottom dive time for all dive depths. If the Type A/B scoring was assigned to outcome severity, the no decompression limits (NDL) for air dives were still controlled by the acceptable serious DCS risk limit rather than the acceptable mild DCS risk limit. However, in this case, longer NDL limits were allowed than with the Type I/II scoring. The trinomial model mild and serious probabilities agree reasonably well with the current air NDL only with the Type A/B scoring and when 0.2% risk of serious DCS is allowed."

https://openalex.org/W2669734009,"Genomic wide selection is a promising approach for improving the selection accuracy in plant breeding, particularly in species with long life cycles, such as Jatropha. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to estimate the genetic parameters for grain yield (GY) and the weight of 100 seeds (W100S) using restricted maximum likelihood (REML); to compare the performance of GWS methods to predict GY and W100S; and to estimate how many markers are needed to train the GWS model to obtain the maximum accuracy. Eight GWS models were compared in terms of predictive ability. The impact that the marker density had on the predictive ability was investigated using a varying number of markers, from 2 to 1,248. Because the genetic variance between evaluated genotypes was significant, it was possible to obtain selection gain. All of the GWS methods tested in this study can be used to predict GY and W100S in Jatropha. A training model fitted using 1,000 and 800 markers is sufficient to capture the maximum genetic variance and, consequently, maximum prediction ability of GY and W100S, respectively. This study demonstrated the applicability of genome-wide prediction to identify useful genetic sources of GY and W100S for Jatropha breeding. Further research is needed to confirm the applicability of the proposed approach to other complex traits."

https://openalex.org/W2657941304,"Osteopontin (Opn), a multifunctional extracellular matrix protein, is implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory disorders. Under physiologic conditions, its expression is restricted to certain tissues including bone and kidney tubule. However, cellular activation during disease development induces Opn expression in various immune cells. In this study, using Opn-EGFP knock-in (KI) mice we found that CD8α+ T cells in the intestinal tissues, including Peyer's patch, lamina propria and epithelium, express Opn under steady state conditions. Therefore, we examined the role of Opn-expressing CD8α+ T cells in intestinal homeostasis. Interestingly, Opn knockout (KO) mice had altered fecal microflora concordant with a reduction of TCRγδ+ intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs). Consistent with this result, both treatment with anti-Opn blocking antibody and deficiency of Opn resulted in decreased survival of TCRγδ+ and TCRαβ+ IELs. This data suggests that a possibility that Opn may function as a survival factor for IELs in the intestinal tissue. Collectively, these data suggest the possibility that Opn might regulate the homeostasis of intestinal microflora through maintenance of TCRγδ+ IELs, possibly by support of IEL survival."

Lower extremity muscle mass (LEM) was defined as the sum of the fat-free soft tissue mass of the legs, and lower extremity muscle mass index (LMI) was calculated as LEM/body weight (%). DLEM was defined as an LMI more than two standard deviations below the mean of a gender-matched young reference group. Categorical variables were presented as numbers (weighted %).The prevalence of knee pain and RKOA were 22% (n = 721) and 34.7% (n = 1,234), respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed being female (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.67-2.79), older (OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.04), less educated (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.09-2.71), stiffness (OR 16.15, 95% CI 12.04-21.66), bed rest (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.81-3.43), RKOA (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.78-2.74) and DLEM (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.09-2.17) were associated with knee pain. Participants with simultaneous RKOA and DLEM complained of more severe pain (pain score 7.18 ± 2.48) than those with knee pain without RKOA or DLEM (5.02 ± 2.44), those with only RKOA (6.29 ± 2.50), or those with only DLEM (6.78 ± 2.18) (P<0.001). These results remained after multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs).The prevalence of knee pain and RKOA were 22% and 34.7%, respectively, in the general Korean population.

https://openalex.org/W2598997836,"The invasive larvae (cercariae) of schistosomes penetrate the skin of their definitive hosts. During the invasion, they undergo dramatic ultrastructural and physiological transitions. These changes result in the development of the subsequent stage, schistosomulum, which migrates through host tissues in close contact with host’s immune system. One of the striking changes in the transforming cercariae is the shedding of their thick tegumental glycocalyx, which represents an immunoattractive structure; therefore its removal helps cercariae to avoid immune attack. A set of commercial fluorescently labeled lectin probes, their saccharide inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies against the trisaccharide Lewis-X antigen (LeX, CD15) were used to characterize changes in the surface saccharide composition of the neuropathogenic avian schistosome Trichobilharzia regenti during the transformation of cercariae to schistosomula, both in vitro and in vivo. The effect of various lectins on glycocalyx shedding was evaluated microscopically. The involvement of peptidases and their inhibitors on the shedding of glycocalyx was investigated using T. regenti recombinant cathepsin B2 and a set of peptidase inhibitors. The surface glycocalyx of T. regenti cercariae was rich in fucose and mannose/glucose residues. After the transformation of cercariae in vitro or in vivo within their specific duck host, reduction and vanishing of these epitopes was observed, and galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine emerged. The presence of LeX was not observed on the cercariae, but the antigen was gradually expressed from the anterior part of the body in the developing schistosomula. Some lectins which bind to the cercarial surface also induced secretion from the acetabular penetration glands. Seven lectins induced the shedding of glycocalyx by cercariae, among which five bound strongly to cercarial surface; the effect could be blocked by saccharide inhibitors. Mannose-binding protein, part of the lectin pathway of the complement system, also bound to cercariae and schistosomula, but had little effect on glycocalyx shedding. Our study did not confirm the involvement of proteolysis in glycocalyx shedding."
https://openalex.org/W2603935660,"Prokaryotic communities forming symbiotic relationships with the vent shrimp, Rimicaris exoculata, are well studied components of hydrothermal ecosystems at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR). Despite the tight link between host and symbiont, the observed lack of spatial genetic structure seen in R. exoculata contrasts with the geographic differentiation detected in specific bacterial ectosymbionts. The geographic clustering of bacterial lineages within a seemingly panmictic host suggests either the presence of finer scale restriction to gene flow not yet detected in the host, horizontal transmission (environmental selection) of its endosymbionts as a consequence of unique vent geochemistry, or vertically transmitted endosymbionts that exhibit genetic differentiation. To identify which hypothesis best fits, we tested whether bacterial assemblages exhibit differentiation across sites or host populations by performing a 16S rRNA metabarcoding survey on R. exoculata digestive prokaryote samples (n = 31) taken from three geochemically distinct vents across MAR: Rainbow, Trans-Atlantic Geotraverse (TAG) and Logatchev. Analysis of communities across two organs (digestive tract, stomach), three molt colors (white, red, black) and three life stages (eggs, juveniles, adults) also provided insights into symbiont transmission mode. Examining both whole communities and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) confirmed the presence of three main epibionts: Epsilonproteobacteria, Mollicutes and Deferribacteres. With these findings, we identified a clear pattern of geographic segregation by vent in OTUs assigned to Epsilonproteobacteria. Additionally, we detected evidence for differentiation among all communities associated to vents and life stages. Overall, results suggest a combination of environmental selection and vertical inheritance of some of the symbiotic lineages."
https://openalex.org/W2621355988,"Background Most children have periods in their life where they reject familiar as well as non-familiar food items and this is often referred to as pickiness. The consequences of pickiness may be malnutrition and, if prolonged, potentially lower body weight. However, studies investigating the consequence of pickiness on subsequent changes in diet intake and weight are limited. Objectives To examine whether pickiness influences body mass index as well as diet intake over subsequent 15 months among obesity prone normal weight children aged 2–6 years. Methods Data was obtained from the “Healthy Start” intervention study which included 271 children aged 2–6 years susceptible to overweight later in life. Information on pickiness was obtained from a parental questionnaire. Dietary habits were collected by 4-day dietary records filled in by the parents and height and weight were measured by trained health professionals and both measured twice over a 15 month period. Linear regression models were performed to assess the influence of pickiness on body mass index and diet with adjustments for possible confounders. Results No differences in mean BMI Z-score were seen between picky/non-picky (P = 0.68) and little picky/non-picky (P = 0.68) children at 15 month follow-up. Picky children had a lower intake of protein (P = 0.01) than non-picky children despite no differences in total energy intake (P = 0.74), or in the other macronutrients, or the intake of fruit and vegetables, though children being a little picky had a lower intake of starch compared to non-picky children (P = 0.05). Results were essentially similar before and after adjustment for key covariates. Conclusion Our study showed that BMI Z-score after 15 months follow-up was similar for picky and non-picky children. Picky children seemed to develop a lower protein intake despite similar total energy intake and diet composition."
https://openalex.org/W2649026679,"Compaction of DNA in chromatin is a hallmark of the eukaryotic cell and unravelling its structure is required for an understanding of DNA involving processes. Despite strong experimental efforts, many questions concerning the DNA packing are open. In particular, it is heavily debated whether an ordered structure referred to as the ""30 nm fibre"" exist in vivo. Scanning probe microscopy has become a cutting edge technology for the high-resolution imaging of DNA- protein complexes. Here, we perform high-resolution atomic force microscopy of non-cross-linked chromatin arrays in liquid, under different salt conditions. A statistical analysis of the data reveals that array compaction is salt dependent in a non-monotonic fashion. A simple physical model can qualitatively explain the observed findings due to the opposing effects of salt dependent stiffening of DNA, nucleosome stability and histone-histone interactions. While for different salt concentrations different compaction states are observed, our data do not provide support for the existence of regular chromatin fibres. Our studies add new insights into chromatin structure, and with that contribute to a further understanding of the DNA condensation."

https://openalex.org/W2620793294,"Month-season of birth (M-SOB) is a risk factor in multiple chronic diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS), where the lowest and greatest risk of developing MS coincide with the lowest and highest birth rates, respectively. To determine whether M-SOB effects in such chronic diseases as MS can be experimentally modeled, we examined the effect of M-SOB on susceptibility of C57BL/6J mice to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). As in MS, mice that were born during the M-SOB with the lowest birth rate were less susceptible to EAE than mice born during the M-SOB with the highest birth rate. We also show that the M-SOB effect on EAE susceptibility is associated with differential production of multiple cytokines/chemokines by neuroantigen-specific T cells that are known to play a role in EAE pathogenesis. Taken together, these results support the existence of an M-SOB effect that may reflect seasonally dependent developmental differences in adaptive immune responses to self-antigens independent of external stimuli, including exposure to sunlight and vitamin D. Moreover, our documentation of an M-SOB effect on EAE susceptibility in mice allows for modeling and detailed analysis of mechanisms that underlie the M-SOB effect in not only MS but in numerous other diseases in which M-SOB impacts susceptibility.-Reynolds, J.

https://openalex.org/W2637072175,"Because synonymy treatment traditionally relies on morphological judgments, it usually causes many problems in species delimitation and in the biodiversity catalogue. For example, Diplopterygium simulans, which belongs to the Gleicheniaceae family, has been considered to be synonymous with D. glaucum or D. giganteum based mainly on the morphology of its pinna rachis and blade. In the absence of molecular evidence, these revisions remain doubtful. DNA barcoding, which is considered to be a powerful method for species-level identification, was employed to assess the genetic distance among 9 members of the Diplopterygium genus. The results indicate that D. simulans is an independent species rather than a synonymy of D. glaucum or D. giganteum. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis uncovered the sisterhood of D. simulans and D. cantonense, which is supported by their geographical distributions and morphological traits. Incorrect synonymy treatment is prevalent in the characterization of biological diversity, and our study proposes a convenient and effective method for validating synonym treatments and discovering cryptic species."

However, a novel potential fimbrilin, PGN_1808, in P. gingivalis strain ATCC 33277 was recently identified by an in silico structural homology search. In this study, we experimentally examined whether the protein formed a fimbrial structure. Anion-exchange chromatography showed that the elution peak of the protein was not identical to those of the major fimbrilins of FimA and Mfa1, indicating that PGN_1808 is not a component of these fimbriae. Electrophoretic analyses showed that PGN_1808 formed a polymer, although it was detergent and heat labile compared to FimA and Mfa1. Transmission electron microscopy showed filamentous structures (2‒3 nm × 200‒400 nm) on the cell surfaces of a PGN_1808-overexpressing P. gingivalis mutant (deficient in both FimA and Mfa1 fimbriae) and in the PGN_1808 fraction.

Here we investigate memory B cell properties at viral set-point and at a late time point (respectively median 54 and 73 weeks) before (re)-initiation of treatment.At viral set-point, the memory B cell compartment in treated patients demonstrated significantly lower fractions of antigen-primed, activated, memory B cells (p = 0.006). In contrast to untreated patients, in treated patients the humoral HIV-specific response reached a set point over time. At a transcriptional level, sets of genes that showed enhanced expression in memory B cells at viral setpoint in untreated patients, conversely showed rapid increase of expression of the same genes in treated patients at the late time point.These data suggest that, although the memory B cell compartment is phenotypically preserved until viral setpoint after treatment interruption, the development of the HIV-specific antibody response may benefit from exposure to HIV. The effect of viral exposure on B cell properties is also reflected by longitudinal changes in transcriptional profile in memory B cells over time in early treated patients."
https://openalex.org/W2610441711,"A majority of academic medical centers (AMCs) have now adopted conflict of interest policies (COI) to address relationships with pharmaceutical and device industries that can increase the risk of bias in patient care, education and research. However, AMCs may have little information on the impact of their policies. This paper provides a new method, which is a free, publicly-available survey, to fill this information gap and improve COI programs at AMCs.The survey, piloted in three AMCs and designed in collaboration with national conflicts of interest policy experts, covers a range of universal compliance-related concerns, which allows institutions to tailor questions to align with their own policies and culture. The survey was low-burden, and provided important data for these AMCs to evaluate their policies. A descriptive analysis of the pooled pilot site data (n = 1578) was performed, which found that a majority of respondents did not have financial ties with industry and a majority was satisfied with specific COI policies at their institutions. The analysis also showed that the survey is sensitive to differences that AMCs will find meaningful. For instance, individuals with industry ties were significantly more likely than individuals without ties to think that COI policies unnecessarily hindered interactions with industry (p = .004), were ineffective at reducing harm to patients (p < .001), and were ineffective in reducing bias in medical education (p>.001).The survey is now free and publicly available for use by any institution. AMCs can use the results to update and refine policies, and to provide ongoing education regarding existing policies."
https://openalex.org/W2624927679,"Southwest Australia (SWA) is a global biodiversity hotspot and a centre of diversity and endemism for the Australo-Papuan myobatrachid frogs. Myobatrachus gouldii (the turtle frog) has a highly derived morphology associated with its forward burrowing behaviour, largely subterranean habit, and unusual mode of reproduction. Its sister genera Metacrinia and Arenophryne have restricted distributions in Western Australia with significant phylogeographic structure, leading to the recent description of a new species in the latter. In contrast, Myobatrachus is distributed widely throughout SWA over multiple climatic zones, but little is known of its population structure, geographic variation in morphology, or reproduction. We generated molecular and morphological data to test for genetic and morphological variation, and to assess whether substrate specialisation in this species may have led to phylogeographic structuring similar to that of other plant and animal taxa in SWA. We assembled sequence data for one mitochondrial and four nuclear DNA loci (3628 base pairs) for 42 turtle frogs sampled throughout their range. Likelihood phylogenetic analyses revealed shallow phylogeographic structure in the mtDNA locus (up to 3.3% genetic distance) and little variation in three of the four nDNA loci. The mtDNA haplotype network suggests five geographically allopatric groups, with no shared haplotypes between regions. These geographic patterns are congruent with several other SWA species, with genetic groups restricted to major hydrological divisions, the Swan Coastal Plain, and the Darling Scarp. The geographically structured genetic groups showed no evidence of significant morphological differentiation (242 individuals), and there was little sexual size dimorphism, but subtle differences in reproductive traits suggest more opportunistic breeding in lower rainfall zones. Call data were compared to sister genera Metacrinia and Arenophryne and found to be highly conservative across the three genera. Like many taxa in SWA, topographic variation and Plio-Pleistocene arid fluctuations likely were historic drivers of diversification in M. gouldii."
https://openalex.org/W2658883036,"When humans perceive the lightness of an object’s surface in shadows there is an implicit assumption that cast shadows dim the surface. In two experiments, we investigated whether 5- to 8-month-old infants make this assumption about shadows. According to this shadow assumption, the apparent change in lightness produced by shadows on an object’s surface are attributed to blocked light sources. If infants can use the shadow assumption to perceive the object’s lightness in shadows, they will also be able to detect unnatural lightness changes in shadows. We compared the infants’ looking times to the unnatural and the natural lightness changes in the shadow when an object (duck) goes through the cast shadow. In Experiment 1, we examined whether infants could detect the unnatural lightness changes of the object’s surface in shadows. We created computer-graphic movies of unnatural and natural lightness changes to the duck’s surface. Our results showed that 7- to 8-month-olds but not 5- to 6-month-olds significantly preferred the movie with the unnatural changes in lightness, indicating that only the older infants could detect these changes. In Experiment 2, we confirmed that the infants’ preference was based on the detection of unnatural lightness changes according to the shadow assumption. The natural and the unnatural lightness changes of Experiment 1 were presented without cast shadows. Under these conditions, neither younger nor older infants showed a significant preference. Taken together, the experiments showed that 7- to 8-month-old infants could detect the unnaturalness of a surface’s lightness changes produced by shadows. In conclusion, our findings suggest that 7- to 8-month-old infants can perceive an object’s lightness in shadows by using an assumption that cast shadows dim the surface of an object."
https://openalex.org/W2688190264,"Although opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV) is common and debilitating, its mechanism is still unclear. Recently, we suggested that opioids affect semicircular canal function and that this leads to a mismatch between canal input and other sensory information during head motion, which triggers OINV. Here, we assess if visual input is relevant for this mismatch. In a randomized-controlled crossover study 14 healthy men (26.9±3.4 years, mean±SD) were tested twice, once blindfolded and once with eyes open, with at least one-day washout. The opioid remifentanil was administered intravenously (0.15 μg/kg/min) for 60 minutes. After a thirty-minutes resting period, subjects' head and trunk were passively moved. Nausea was rated before remifentanil start (T0), before the movement intervention (T30) and after 60 minutes (T60) of administration. At rest (T0, T30), median nausea ratings were zero whether subjects were blindfolded or not. Movement triggered nausea independently of visual input (nausea rating 1.5/3.0 (median/interquartile range) in the blindfolded, 2.5/6 in the eyes-open condition, χ2(1) = 1.3, p = 0.25). As movement exacerbates OINV independently of visual input, a clash between visual and semicircular canal information is not the relevant trigger for OINV. To prevent OINV, emphasis should be put on head-rest, eye-closure is less important."
https://openalex.org/W2897770822,"Vision-based vehicle detection is an important issue for advanced driver assistance systems. In this paper, we presented an improved multi-vehicle detection and tracking method using cascade Adaboost and Adaptive Kalman filter(AKF) with target identity awareness. A cascade Adaboost classifier using Haar-like features was built for vehicle detection, followed by a more comprehensive verification process which could refine the vehicle hypothesis in terms of both location and dimension. In vehicle tracking, each vehicle was tracked with independent identity by an Adaptive Kalman filter in collaboration with a data association approach. The AKF adaptively adjusted the measurement and process noise covariance through on-line stochastic modelling to compensate the dynamics changes. The data association correctly assigned different detections with tracks using global nearest neighbour(GNN) algorithm while considering the local validation. During tracking, a temporal context based track management was proposed to decide whether to initiate, maintain or terminate the tracks of different objects, thus suppressing the sparse false alarms and compensating the temporary detection failures. Finally, the proposed method was tested on various challenging real roads, and the experimental results showed that the vehicle detection performance was greatly improved with higher accuracy and robustness."
https://openalex.org/W2596269260,"This paper presents a wireless system to send biosignals outside a hyperbaric chamber avoiding wires going through the chamber walls. Hyperbaric chambers are becoming more and more common due to new indications of hyperbaric oxygen treatments. Metallic walls physically isolate patients inside the chamber, where getting a patient’s vital signs turns into a painstaking task. The paper proposes using a ZigBee-based network to wirelessly transmit the patient's biosignals to the outside of the chamber. In particular, a wearable battery supported device has been designed, implemented and tested. Although the implementation has been conducted to transmit the electrocardiography signal, the device can be easily adapted to consider other biosignals."
https://openalex.org/W2696621038,"In the present paper, the controlled flight of fruitflies after voluntary takeoff is studied. Wing and body kinematics of the insects after takeoff are measured using high-speed video techniques, and the aerodynamic force and moment are calculated by the computational fluid dynamics method based on the measured data. How the control moments are generated is analyzed by correlating the computed moments with the wing kinematics. A fruit-fly has a large pitch-up angular velocity owing to the takeoff jump and the fly controls its body attitude by producing pitching moments. It is found that the pitching moment is produced by changes in both the aerodynamic force and the moment arm. The change in the aerodynamic force is mainly due to the change in angle of attack. The change in the moment arm is mainly due to the change in the mean stroke angle and deviation angle, and the deviation angle plays a more important role than the mean stroke angle in changing the moment arm (note that change in deviation angle implies variation in the position of the aerodynamic stroke plane with respect to the anatomical stroke plane). This is unlike the case of fruitflies correcting pitch perturbations in steady free flight, where they produce pitching moment mainly by changes in mean stroke angle."
