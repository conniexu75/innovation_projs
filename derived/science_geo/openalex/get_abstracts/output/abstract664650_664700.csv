https://openalex.org/W3112547455,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state in northern Brazil. The attack rate there is an estimate of the final size of the largely unmitigated epidemic that occurred in Manaus. We use a convenience sample of blood donors to show that by June 2020, 1 month after the epidemic peak in Manaus, 44% of the population had detectable immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Correcting for cases without a detectable antibody response and for antibody waning, we estimate a 66% attack rate in June, rising to 76% in October. This is higher than in São Paulo, in southeastern Brazil, where the estimated attack rate in October was 29%. These results confirm that when poorly controlled, COVID-19 can infect a large proportion of the population, causing high mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3112749784,"<h2>Summary</h2> The evolutionarily conserved default mode network (DMN) is a distributed set of brain regions coactivated during resting states that is vulnerable to brain disorders. How disease affects the DMN is unknown, but detailed anatomical descriptions could provide clues. Mice offer an opportunity to investigate structural connectivity of the DMN across spatial scales with cell-type resolution. We co-registered maps from functional magnetic resonance imaging and axonal tracing experiments into the 3D Allen mouse brain reference atlas. We find that the mouse DMN consists of preferentially interconnected cortical regions. As a population, DMN layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons project almost exclusively to other DMN regions, whereas L5 neurons project in and out of the DMN. In the retrosplenial cortex, a core DMN region, we identify two L5 projection types differentiated by in- or out-DMN targets, laminar position, and gene expression. These results provide a multi-scale description of the anatomical correlates of the mouse DMN."

https://openalex.org/W3110732593,"The survival of viruses in droplets is known to depend on droplets’ chemical composition, which may vary in respiratory fluid between individuals and over the course of disease. This relationship is also important for understanding the persistence of viruses in droplets generated from wastewater, freshwater, and seawater. We investigated the effects of salt (0, 1, and 35 g/L), protein (0, 100, and 1000 μg/mL), surfactant (0, 1, and 10 μg/mL), and droplet pH (4.0, 7.0, and 10.0) on the viability of viruses in 1-μL droplets pipetted onto polystyrene surfaces and exposed to 20%, 50%, and 80% relative humidity (RH) using a culture-based approach. Results showed that viability of MS2, a non-enveloped virus, was generally higher than that of Φ6, an enveloped virus, in droplets after 1 hour. The chemical composition of droplets greatly influenced virus viability. Specifically, the survival of MS2 was similar in droplets at different pH values, but the viability of Φ6 was significantly reduced in acidic and basic droplets compared to neutral ones. The presence of bovine serum albumin protected both MS2 and Φ6 from inactivation in droplets. The effects of sodium chloride and the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate varied by virus type and RH. Meanwhile, RH affected the viability of viruses as shown previously: viability was lowest at intermediate to high RH. The results demonstrate that the viability of viruses is determined by the chemical composition of carrier droplets, especially pH and protein content, and environmental factors. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the chemical composition of carrier droplets in order to predict the persistence of viruses contained in them."
https://openalex.org/W3113315534,"The privacy of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is facing a major hurdle with outsourcing private health data in the cloud as there exists danger of leaking health information to unauthorized parties. In fact, EHRs are stored on centralized databases that increases the security risk footprint and requires trust in a single authority which cannot effectively protect data from internal attacks. This research focuses on ensuring the patient privacy and data security while sharing the sensitive data across same or different organisations as well as healthcare providers in a distributed environment. This research develops a privacy-preserving framework viz Healthchain based on Blockchain technology that maintains security, privacy, scalability and integrity of the e-health data. The Blockchain is built on Hyperledger fabric, a permissioned distributed ledger solutions by using Hyperledger composer and stores EHRs by utilizing InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to build this healthchain framework. Moreover, the data stored in the IPFS is encrypted by using a unique cryptographic public key encryption algorithm to create a robust blockchain solution for electronic health data. The objective of the research is to provide a foundation for developing security solutions against cyber-attacks by exploiting the inherent features of the blockchain, and thus contribute to the robustness of healthcare information sharing environments. Through the results, the proposed model shows that the healthcare records are not traceable to unauthorized access as the model stores only the encrypted hash of the records that proves effectiveness in terms of data security, enhanced data privacy, improved data scalability, interoperability and data integrity while sharing and accessing medical records among stakeholders across the healthchain network."
https://openalex.org/W3027017053,"The accurate segmentation and tracking of cells in microscopy image sequences is an important task in biomedical research, e.g., for studying the development of tissues, organs or entire organisms. However, the segmentation of touching cells in images with a low signal-to-noise-ratio is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a method for the segmentation of touching cells in microscopy images. By using a novel representation of cell borders, inspired by distance maps, our method is capable to utilize not only touching cells but also close cells in the training process. Furthermore, this representation is notably robust to annotation errors and shows promising results for the segmentation of microscopy images containing in the training data underrepresented or not included cell types. For the prediction of the proposed neighbor distances, an adapted U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) with two decoder paths is used. In addition, we adapt a graph-based cell tracking algorithm to evaluate our proposed method on the task of cell tracking. The adapted tracking algorithm includes a movement estimation in the cost function to re-link tracks with missing segmentation masks over a short sequence of frames. Our combined tracking by detection method has proven its potential in the IEEE ISBI 2020 Cell Tracking Challenge (http://celltrackingchallenge.net/) where we achieved as team KIT-Sch-GE multiple top three rankings including two top performances using a single segmentation model for the diverse data sets."
https://openalex.org/W3110733720,"In the absence of curative therapies, treatment of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) using currently available drugs can be improved by integrating evolutionary principles that govern proliferation of resistant subpopulations into current treatment protocols. Here we develop what is coined as an ‘evolutionary stable therapy’, within the context of the mathematical model that has been used to inform the first adaptive therapy clinical trial of mCRPC. The objective of this therapy is to maintain a stable polymorphic tumor heterogeneity of sensitive and resistant cells to therapy in order to prolong treatment efficacy and progression free survival. Optimal control analysis shows that an increasing dose titration protocol, a very common clinical dosing process, can achieve tumor stabilization for a wide range of potential initial tumor compositions and volumes. Furthermore, larger tumor volumes may counter intuitively be more likely to be stabilized if sensitive cells dominate the tumor composition at time of initial treatment, suggesting a delay of initial treatment could prove beneficial. While it remains uncertain if metastatic disease in humans has the properties that allow it to be truly stabilized, the benefits of a dose titration protocol warrant additional pre-clinical and clinical investigations."
https://openalex.org/W3111868370,"Understanding cities as complex systems, sustainable urban planning depends on reliable high-resolution data, for example of the building stock to upscale region-wide retrofit policies. For some cities and regions, these data exist in detailed 3D models based on real-world measurements. However, they are still expensive to build and maintain, a significant challenge, especially for small and medium-sized cities that are home to the majority of the European population. New methods are needed to estimate relevant building stock characteristics reliably and cost-effectively. Here, we present a machine learning based method for predicting building heights, which is based only on open-access geospatial data on urban form, such as building footprints and street networks. The method allows to predict building heights for regions where no dedicated 3D models exist currently. We train our model using building data from four European countries (France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Germany) and find that the morphology of the urban fabric surrounding a given building is highly predictive of the height of the building. A test on the German state of Brandenburg shows that our model predicts building heights with an average error well below the typical floor height (about 2.5 m), without having access to training data from Germany. Furthermore, we show that even a small amount of local height data obtained by citizens substantially improves the prediction accuracy. Our results illustrate the possibility of predicting missing data on urban infrastructure; they also underline the value of open government data and volunteered geographic information for scientific applications, such as contextual but scalable strategies to mitigate climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3112918582,"Background The World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Healthcare workers are directly involved in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19.This study aims to assess the prevalence of anxiety and its associated factors towards the COVID-19 outbreak among healthcare workers in a Hospital of Ethiopia. Methods A Hospital-based survey study was conducted on a total of 305 Healthcare workers in a Hospital of Ethiopia. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyze data between independent variables with anxiety. Variables with a p-value of &lt;0.2 were transformed into multivariate analysis. Crude and adjusted odds ratios with 95% CI, p-values of &lt;0.05 were used to show the strength of association and level of significance. Results The prevalence of CVID-19 anxiety was 63%. In multivariate logistic regression, age of 30–39 (AOR, 3.05; 95% CI, (1.70, 5.47) and age of ≥40 (AOR, 11.32; 95% CI (3.37, 37.98), being married (AOR, 3.56; 95% CI, (2.30, 6.38), having chronic illness (AOR, 3.43; 95% CI, (1.59,7.43), having suspected COVID-19 family members (AOR, 5.20; 95% CI, (2.11, 12.78), and not having an access to PPEs (AOR, 2.55; 95% CI, (1.43, 4.56) were statistically significantly associated with anxiety. Conclusion Being married, having a chronic illness, having suspected COVID-19 family members, not having access to PPEs, and age greater than or equal to 30 years were identified as risk factors for anxiety of Healthcare Workers towards COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W3110982212,"Purpose To investigate superficial retinal microvascular plexuses detected by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects and compare them with healthy controls. Methods A total of 92 eyes from 92 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 149 control eyes were included in this prospective observational study. OCT-A imaging was performed using Triton Swept-Source OCT (Topcon Corporation, Japan). The vessel density (VD) percentage in the superficial retinal plexus and optic disc area (6 x 6 mm grid) was measured and compared between groups. Results MS patients showed a significant decrease VD in the superior (p = 0.005), nasal (p = 0.029) and inferior (p = 0.040) parafoveal retina compared with healthy subjects. Patients with disease durations of more than 5 years presented lower VD in the superior (p = 0.002), nasal (p = 0.017) and inferior (p = 0.022) parafoveal areas compared with healthy subjects. Patients with past optic neuritis episodes did not show retinal microvasculature alterations, but patients with an EDSS score of less than 3 showed a significant decrease in nasal (p = 0.024) and superior (p = 0.006) perifoveal VD when compared with healthy subjects. Conclusions MS produces a decrease in retinal vascularization density in the superficial plexus of the parafoveal retina. Alterations in retinal vascularization observed in MS patients are independent of the presence of optic nerve inflammation. OCT-A has the ability to detect subclinical vascular changes and is a potential biomarker for diagnosing the presence and progression of MS."
https://openalex.org/W3110701940,"Objective: Mining the data contained within Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can potentially generate a greater understanding of medication effects in the real world, complementing what we know from Randomised control trials (RCTs). We Propose a text mining approach to detect adverse events and medication episodes from the clinical text to enhance our understanding of adverse effects related to Clozapine, the most effective antipsychotic drug for the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but underutilised due to concerns over its side effects. Material and Methods: We used data from de-identified EHRs of three mental health trusts in the UK (>50 million documents, over 500,000 patients, 2835 of which were prescribed Clozapine). We explored the prevalence of 33 adverse effects by age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status and admission type three months before and after the patients started Clozapine treatment. We compared the prevalence of adverse effects with those reported in the Side Effects Resource (SIDER) where possible. Results: Sedation, fatigue, agitation, dizziness, hypersalivation, weight gain, tachycardia, headache, constipation and confusion were amongst the highest recorded Clozapine adverse effect in the three months following the start of treatment. Higher percentages of all adverse effects were found in the first month of Clozapine therapy. Using a significance level of (p< 0.05) out chi-square tests show a significant association between most of the ADRs in smoking status and hospital admissions and some in gender and age groups. Further, the data was combined from three trusts, and chi-square tests were applied to estimate the average effect of ADRs in each monthly interval. Conclusion: A better understanding of how the drug works in the real world can complement clinical trials and precision medicine."
https://openalex.org/W3112899019,"Salmonellosis and listeriosis together accounted for more than one third of foodborne illnesses in the United States and almost half the hospitalizations for gastrointestinal diseases in 2018 while tuberculosis afflicted over 10 million people worldwide causing almost 2 million deaths. Regardless of the intrinsic virulence differences among Listeria monocytogenes , Salmonella enterica and Mycobacterium tuberculosis , these intracellular pathogens share the ability to survive and persist inside the macrophage and other cells and thrive in iron rich environments. Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) is a central cytokine in host defense against intracellular pathogens and has been shown to promote iron export in macrophages. We hypothesize that IFN-γ decreases iron availability to intracellular pathogens consequently limiting replication in these cells. In this study, we show that IFN-γ regulates the expression of iron-related proteins hepcidin, ferroportin, and ferritin to induce iron export from macrophages. Listeria monocytogenes , S . enterica , and M . tuberculosis infections significantly induce iron sequestration in human macrophages. In contrast, IFN-γ significantly reduces hepcidin secretion in S . enterica and M . tuberculosis infected macrophages. Similarly, IFN-γ-activated macrophages express higher ferroportin levels than untreated controls even after infection with L . monocytogenes bacilli; bacterial infection greatly down-regulates ferroportin expression. Collectively, IFN-γ significantly inhibits pathogen-associated intracellular iron sequestration in macrophages and consequently retards the growth of intracellular bacterial pathogens by decreasing iron availability."
https://openalex.org/W3110710617,"In mammals with binocular vision, integration of the left and right visual scene relies on information in the center visual field, which are relayed from each retina in parallel and merge in the primary visual cortex (V1) through the convergence of ipsi- and contralateral geniculocortical inputs as well as transcallosal projections between two visual cortices. The developmental assembly of this binocular circuit, especially the transcallosal pathway, remains incompletely understood. Using genetic methods in mice, we found that several days before eye-opening, retinal and callosal activities drive massive apoptosis of GABAergic chandelier cells (ChCs) in the binocular region of V1. Blockade of ChC elimination resulted in a contralateral eye-dominated V1 and deficient binocular vision. As pre-vision retinal activities convey the left-right organization of the visual field, their regulation of ChC density through the transcallosal pathway may prime a nascent binocular territory for subsequent experience-driven tuning during the post-vision critical period."
https://openalex.org/W3112773181,"What does it mean to be happy? The vast majority of cross-cultural studies on happiness have employed a Western-origin, or “WEIRD” measure of happiness that conceptualizes it as a self-centered (or “independent”), high-arousal emotion. However, research from Eastern cultures, particularly Japan, conceptualizes happiness as including an interpersonal aspect emphasizing harmony and connectedness to others. Following a combined emic-etic approach (Cheung, van de Vijver &amp; Leong, 2011), we assessed the cross-cultural applicability of a measure of independent happiness developed in the US (Subjective Happiness Scale; Lyubomirsky &amp; Lepper, 1999) and a measure of interdependent happiness developed in Japan (Interdependent Happiness Scale; Hitokoto &amp; Uchida, 2015), with data from 63 countries representing 7 sociocultural regions. Results indicate that the schema of independent happiness was more coherent in more WEIRD countries. In contrast, the coherence of interdependent happiness was unrelated to a country’s “WEIRD-ness.” Reliabilities of both happiness measures were lowest in African and Middle Eastern countries, suggesting these two conceptualizations of happiness may not be globally comprehensive. Overall, while the two measures had many similar correlates and properties, the self-focused concept of independent happiness is “WEIRD-er” than interdependent happiness, suggesting cross-cultural researchers should attend to both conceptualizations."
https://openalex.org/W3113068668,"MORN (Membrane Occupation and Recognition Nexus) repeat proteins have a wide taxonomic distribution, being found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Despite this ubiquity, they remain poorly characterised at both a structural and a functional level compared to other common repeats. In functional terms, they are often assumed to be lipid-binding modules that mediate membrane targeting. We addressed this putative activity by focusing on a protein composed solely of MORN repeats-Trypanosoma brucei MORN1. Surprisingly, no evidence for binding to membranes or lipid vesicles by TbMORN1 could be obtained either in vivo or in vitro. Conversely, TbMORN1 did interact with individual phospholipids. High- and low-resolution structures of the MORN1 protein from Trypanosoma brucei and homologous proteins from the parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Plasmodium falciparum were obtained using a combination of macromolecular crystallography, small-angle X-ray scattering, and electron microscopy. This enabled a first structure-based definition of the MORN repeat itself. Furthermore, all three structures dimerised via their C-termini in an antiparallel configuration. The dimers could form extended or V-shaped quaternary structures depending on the presence of specific interface residues. This work provides a new perspective on MORN repeats, showing that they are protein-protein interaction modules capable of mediating both dimerisation and oligomerisation."
https://openalex.org/W3110690210,"Career aspirations are considered to be one of the most important motivation variables in the study of psychology and career development, as well as being connected to an individual’s career-related goals, intentions or options. The aims of this study were: (a) to develop and validate a model for predicting career aspirations, and (b) to investigate direct and indirect links between paternal education, self-esteem, resilience, future orientation, and career aspirations of university students. The participants were 445 students from two universities in Thailand. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the factor structure of four measurement models presented in the study was suitable and compatible. To achieve the intended research objectives, the empirical data were analyzed using structural equation modeling with decomposition analysis of total effects in direct and indirect effects. Results showed that paternal education, resilience, and future orientation have significant direct effects on students’ career aspirations, while self-esteem has an indirect effect. This suggests that self-esteem can help students develop their resilience, as well as promoting their development of a positive future orientation, which also helps foster a higher level of career aspiration. These results can be fundamental to supporting the continued use of the structural equation model in future research on career development."
https://openalex.org/W3112328469,"Patches from three orthogonal views of selected cerebral regions can be utilized to learn convolutional neural network (CNN) models for staging the Alzheimer disease (AD) spectrum including preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment due to AD, and dementia due to AD and normal controls. Hippocampi, amygdalae and insulae were selected from the volumetric analysis of structured magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Three-view patches (TVPs) from these regions were fed to the CNN for training. MRIs were classified with the SoftMax-normalized scores of individual model predictions on TVPs. The significance of each region of interest (ROI) for staging the AD spectrum was evaluated and reported. The results of the ensemble classifier are compared with state-of-the-art methods using the same evaluation metrics. Patch-based ROI ensembles provide comparable diagnostic performance for AD staging. In this work, TVP-based ROI analysis using a CNN provides informative landmarks in cerebral MRIs and may have significance in clinical studies and computer-aided diagnosis system design."
https://openalex.org/W3112472227,"Honey bees (genus Apis) are well known for the impressive suite of nest defenses they have evolved to protect their abundant stockpiles of food and the large colonies they sustain. In Asia, honey bees have evolved under tremendous predatory pressure from social wasps in the genus Vespa , the most formidable of which are the giant hornets that attack colonies in groups, kill adult defenders, and prey on brood. We document for the first time an extraordinary collective defense used by Apis cerana against the giant hornet Vespa soror . In response to attack by V . soror , A . cerana workers foraged for and applied spots of animal feces around their nest entrances. Fecal spotting increased after colonies were exposed either to naturally occurring attacks or to chemicals that scout hornets use to target colonies for mass attack. Spotting continued for days after attacks ceased and occurred in response to V . soror , which frequently landed at and chewed on entrances to breach nests, but not Vespa velutina , a smaller hornet that rarely landed at entrances. Moderate to heavy fecal spotting suppressed attempts by V . soror to penetrate nests by lowering the incidence of multiple-hornet attacks and substantially reducing the likelihood of them approaching and chewing on entrances. We argue that A . cerana forages for animal feces because it has properties that repel this deadly predator from nest entrances, providing the first report of tool use by honey bees and the first evidence that they forage for solids that are not derived from plants. Our study describes a remarkable weapon in the already sophisticated portfolio of defenses that honey bees have evolved in response to the predatory threats they face. It also highlights the strong selective pressure honey bees will encounter if giant hornets, recently detected in western North America, become established."

https://openalex.org/W3111861849,"Exponential growth bias is the phenomenon whereby humans underestimate exponential growth. In the context of infectious diseases, this bias may lead to a failure to understand the magnitude of the benefit of non-pharmaceutical interventions. Communicating the same scenario in different ways (framing) has been found to have a large impact on people’s evaluations and behavior in the contexts of social behavior, risk taking and health care. We find that framing matters for people’s assessment of the benefits of non-pharmaceutical interventions. In two commonly used frames, most subjects in our experiment drastically underestimate the number of cases avoided by adopting non-pharmaceutical interventions. Framing growth in terms of doubling times rather than growth rates reduces the bias. When the scenario is framed in terms of time gained rather than cases avoided, the median subject assesses the benefit of non-pharmaceutical interventions correctly. These findings suggest changes that could be adopted to better communicate the exponential spread of infectious diseases."

Moreover, these approaches may also be used in evaluating the performance of public health surveillance systems. We provide theoretical arguments for why the empirical laws should hold in the early stages of an epidemic, along with preliminary empirical evidence in support of these claims. Based on data published by the World Health Organization and various national governments, we find empirical evidence that suggests that both Benford’s law and Zipf’s law largely hold across countries, and deviations can be readily explained. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is among the first to present a practical application of Zipf’s law to fraud detection."
https://openalex.org/W3111713842,"Due to the recent emphasis on the importance of interprofessional education (IPE) in healthcare fields, interest in IPE introduction is increasing in South Korea. The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in perceptions of medical, nursing, and pharmacy students regarding IPE. Also, the study aimed at identifying the priority rankings of educational needs by analyzing the differences between students’ perceptions of the importance level and the present level for each interprofessional competency. A cross-sectional study was carried out using a survey. A total of 1,500 questionnaires were distributed, of which 1,084 were returned (response rate, 72.3%). The participants were 559 medical, 393 nursing, and 96 pharmacy students. The questionnaire comprised items on the students’ perception of IPE and their interprofessional competency. The questionnaire comprised 12 items on their IPE perception and 9 items on their interprofessional competency. These items were developed by examining the content validity by medical educational specialists and conducting a factor analysis for verification. Data were analyzed using the t-test and ANOVA, and Borich’s formula was used to calculate the rank of educational needs.89.6% did not know the meaning of IPE. The difference in students’ perception of IPE was not significant by grade. Further, the level of IPE perception was higher for female than male students and for students who knew the meaning of IPE than those who did not. The nursing students’ perception of the importance, preference, and effectiveness of IPE was the highest, whereas medical students’ perception was the lowest. All students perceived their present level to be lower than the importance level for each interprofessional competency. Interprofessional communication skills (6.791) were highly necessary for students. These results will serve as baseline information for developing IPE programs in South Korea."
https://openalex.org/W3111633496,"Reported pain intensity depends not only on stimulus intensity but also on previously experienced pain. A painfully hot temperature applied to the skin evokes a lower subjective pain intensity if immediately preceded by a higher temperature, a phenomenon called offset analgesia. Previous work indicated that prior pain experience can also increase subsequent perceived pain intensity. Therefore, we examined whether a given noxious stimulus is experienced as more intense when it is preceded by an increase from a lower temperature. Using healthy volunteer subjects, we observed a disproportionate increase in pain intensity at a given stimulus intensity when this intensity is preceded by a rise from a lower intensity. This disproportionate increase is similar in magnitude to that of offset analgesia. We call this effect onset hyperalgesia. Control stimuli, in which a noxious temperature is held constant, demonstrate that onset hyperalgesia is distinct from receptor or central sensitization. The absolute magnitudes of offset analgesia and onset hyperalgesia correlate with each other but not with the noxious stimulus temperature. Finally, the magnitude of both offset analgesia and onset hyperalgesia depends on preceding temperature changes. Overall, this study demonstrates that the perceptual effect of a noxious thermal stimulus is influenced in a bidirectional manner depending upon both the intensity and direction of change of the immediately preceding thermal stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W3111865806,"Significance Early age of initiation of tobacco use is associated with sustained tobacco use and lower rates of smoking cessation. Although much is known about age of initiation of cigarette use, much less is known about the age of initiation of cigar product use among youth. Methods Survival analyses of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health youth annual datasets (ages 12–17) from 2013 to 2017 were conducted for any cigar product use, cigarillos or filtered cigars, and traditional cigars across four cigar use outcomes, age of initiation of: susceptibility to use, ever use, past 30-day use and “fairly regular” use. An interval censoring survival method was implemented to estimate the probability of each outcome for age of initiation of each cigar product overall. Differences in age of initiation by sex and race/ethnicity were assessed using weighted Cox proportional hazards models for interval-censored data. Results For each outcome across the three cigar products, striking increases in the probability of initiation begin before 17 years old. For cigarillo or filtered cigars, males had a higher risk of onset of susceptibility to use, initiating ever use, and initiating past 30-day use at earlier ages than females. Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Other had lower risk of initiating ever use and past 30-day use at earlier ages. Non-Hispanic Black youth had higher risk of initiating past 30-day use and “fairly regular” use than Non-Hispanic White youth at earlier ages. Similar findings are reported for any cigar use and traditional cigar use. Conclusion Developmentally and culturally appropriate cigar use interventions and communication campaigns should be provided to youth before 17 years of age to prevent the onset and progression of cigar products. Regulatory policies that reduce appeal of all cigar products should be implemented to curb cigar initiation among youth."
https://openalex.org/W3112367283,"Objectives Although tuberculosis (TB) related stigma has a significant impact on the diagnosis, patient adherence with treatment, and recovery from the disease, there is limited evidence from Ethiopia regarding perceived stigma among patient with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB).The purpose of this study was to assess perceived stigma and associated factors among patient with PTB on treatment in southwest Ethiopia. Methods Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2019 among 410 patient with PTB. Data were collected by using the perceived tuberculosis stigma scale. Epi data v3.1 and SPSSv23 were used for data entry and analysis. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with perceived stigma. Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (AORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Result Prevalence of perceived stigma among patient with Pulmonary tuberculosis was 57.1% (95% CI: 52.2, 61.7). Poor social support (AOR = 2.41; 95% CI: 1.06, 5.48), above a month duration of illness (AOR = 2.48; 95% CI: 1.33, 4.64), high perceived stress (AOR = 1.95; 95% CI:1.09, 3.49), current khat use (AOR = 1.88; 95% CI:1.05, 3.37), and presence of depression (AOR = 8.18; 95% CI:4.40, 15.22) were significantly associated with perceived stigma. Patient with HIV co-infection were 5.67 times (AOR = 5.67; 95% CI: 2.32, 13.87) more likely to have Perceived stigma than their counterparts. Conclusion TB related stigma was reported by more than half of the study participant. Stigma reduction measures are needed to lower TB related stigma perceived by the patient, the level of distress associated with it, and to promote the psychological wellbeing of patient with TB."
https://openalex.org/W3112539008,"A new ophthalmosaurid ichthyosaur, Thalassodraco etchesi gen. et sp. nov., from the Upper Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay Formation of Dorset, UK is described. The specimen, a partial, articulated skull and anterior thorax in the Etches Collection of Kimmeridge, Dorset, is exceptionally well preserved on a slab of laminated coccolith limestone and has been expertly prepared. It comprises a near complete skull in articulation with associated anterior vertebral column and dorsal ribs, complete pectoral girdle, fully exposed left forelimb, and some elements of the right forelimb. Other elements present, including an ischiopubis are preserved on separate slabs. Presumed rapid burial of the anterior portion of the specimen in the coccolith substrate has preserved a number of ossified ligaments lying across the vertebral column and associated ribs as well as stomach contents and decayed internal organs. Aspects of the dentition, skull roof bones and the forelimb configuration distinguishes the new specimen from previously described Late Jurassic ichthyosaurs. Autopmorphies for T . etchesi include a large rounded protuberance on the supratemporal bone; a thin L-shaped lachrymal, with a steeply curved posterior border; ~ 70 teeth on the upper tooth row, and deep anterior dorsal ribs. A well resolved phylogenetic analysis shows T . etchesi as a member of a basal clade within Ophthalmosauridae comprising Nannopterygius , Gengasaurus , Paraophthalmosaurus and Thalassodraco . The new specimen adds to the diversity of the Ichthyopterygia of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation and emphasises the important contribution of amateur collectors in palaeontology."
https://openalex.org/W3113059665,"The phenol equivalence assay is the current industry-adopted test used to quantify the antibacterial activity of honeys in Australia and New Zealand. Activity is measured based on the diffusion of honey through agar and resulting zone of growth inhibition. Due to differences in the aqueous solubilities of antibacterial compounds found in honeys, this method may not be optimal for quantifying activity. Therefore, a new method was developed based on the existing broth microdilution assay that is widely used for determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). It utilises the four organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and an optical density endpoint to quantify bacterial growth. Decreases in bacterial growth in the presence of honey, relative to the positive growth control, are then used to derive a single value to represent the overall antibacterial activity of each honey. Antibacterial activity was quantified for a total of 77 honeys using the new method, the phenol equivalence assay and the standard broth microdilution assay. This included 69 honeys with undisclosed floral sources and the comparators Manuka, Jarrah ( Eucalyptus marginata ), Marri ( Corymbia calophylla ), artificial and multifloral honey. For the 69 honey samples, phenol equivalence values ranged from 0–48.5 with a mean of 34 (% w/v phenol). Mean MICs, determined as the average of the MICs obtained for each of the four organisms for each honey ranged from 7–24% (w/v honey). Using the new assay, values for the 69 honeys ranged from 368 to 669 activity units, with a mean of 596. These new antibacterial activity values correlated closely with mean MICs (R 2 = 0.949) whereas the relationship with phenol equivalence values was weaker (R 2 = 0.649). Limit of detection, limit of quantitation, measuring interval, limit of reporting, sensitivity, selectivity, repeatability, reproducibility, and ruggedness were also investigated and showed that the new assay was both robust and reproducible."
https://openalex.org/W3111661804,"MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that can have large impacts on oncogenic pathways. Possible functions of dysregulated miRs have not been studied in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) plexiform neurofibromas (PNFs). In PNFs, Schwann cells (SCs) have biallelic NF1 mutations necessary for tumorigenesis. We analyzed a miR microarray comparing with normal and PNF SCs and identified differences in miR expression, and we validated in mouse PNFs versus normal mouse SCs by qRT-PCR. Among these, miR-155 was a top overexpressed miR, and its expression was regulated by RAS/MAPK signaling. Overexpression of miR-155 increased mature Nf1−/− mouse SC proliferation. In SC precursors, which model tumor-initiating cells, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of miR-155 decreased PNF-derived sphere numbers in vitro, and we identified Maf as a miR-155 target. In vivo, global deletion of miR-155 significantly decreased tumor number and volume, increasing mouse survival. Fluorescent nanoparticles entered PNFs, suggesting that an anti-miR might have therapeutic potential. However, treatment of established PNFs using anti-miR-155 peptide nucleic acid-loaded nanoparticles marginally decreased tumor numbers and did not reduce tumor growth. These results suggest that miR-155 plays a functional role in PNF growth and/or SC proliferation, and that targeting neurofibroma miRs is feasible, and might provide novel therapeutic opportunities."
https://openalex.org/W3113024278,"The integral membrane zinc metalloprotease ZMPSTE24 is important for human health and longevity. ZMPSTE24 performs a key proteolytic step in maturation of prelamin A, the farnesylated precursor of the nuclear scaffold protein lamin A. Mutations in the genes encoding either prelamin A or ZMPSTE24 that prevent cleavage cause the premature aging disease Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) and related progeroid disorders. ZMPSTE24 has a novel structure, with seven transmembrane spans that form a large water-filled membrane chamber whose catalytic site faces the chamber interior. Prelamin A is the only known mammalian substrate for ZMPSTE24; however, the basis of this specificity remains unclear. To define the sequence requirements for ZMPSTE24 cleavage, we mutagenized the eight residues flanking the prelamin A scissile bond (TRSY↓LLGN) to all other 19 amino acids, creating a library of 152 variants. We also replaced these eight residues with sequences derived from putative ZMPSTE24 cleavage sites from amphibian, bird, and fish prelamin A. Cleavage of prelamin A variants was assessed using an in vivo yeast assay that provides a sensitive measure of ZMPSTE24 processing efficiency. We found that residues on the C-terminal side of the cleavage site are most sensitive to changes. Consistent with other zinc metalloproteases, including thermolysin, ZMPSTE24 preferred hydrophobic residues at the P1' position (Leu647), but in addition, showed a similar, albeit muted, pattern at P2'. Our findings begin to define a consensus sequence for ZMPSTE24 that helps to clarify how this physiologically important protease functions and may ultimately lead to identifying additional substrates."

We investigated effects over an adjacent region, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In total, we analyzed data from 97 participants after exclusions. We found weak or absent effects over the VLPFC and DLPFC. We conducted machine learning studies to examine the effects of semantic and phonetic features on memorization, which revealed no effect of VLPFC tDCS on the original dataset or the current data. The highest contributing factor to memory performance was individual differences in memory not explained by word features, tDCS group, or sample size, while semantic, phonetic, and orthographic word characteristics did not contribute significantly. To our knowledge, this is the first tDCS study to investigate cognitive effects with machine learning, and future studies may benefit from studying physiological as well as cognitive effects with data-driven approaches and computational models."
https://openalex.org/W3112522641,"Aim This study aimed to identify differences in physical performance across various socioeconomic groups within an older population and to convert those differences into a common metric to facilitate comparisons of aging speed across socioeconomic subgroups. Methods We employed data from the 2009 National Health Examination Survey of Thailand. Physical performance was assessed using three health characteristics: grip strength, as a measure of upper body strength; walking speed, as a measure of lower body strength; and a combined measure of grip strength and walking speed, to capture the strength of the whole body. Education level and income were used to distinguish socioeconomic subpopulations. We followed a characteristic-based age approach to transform these population characteristics, which were measured in different units, into a common and comparable aging metric, referred to as α − age . Results Physical aging trajectories varied by sex and socioeconomic status. Some education, particularly secondary or higher education levels, was significantly associated with greater physical strength in older age for both men and women, whereas higher income was significantly associated with physical strength only for men. Across the three health characteristics, having a primary education slowed age-related declines by up to 6.3 years among men and 2.8 years among women, whereas being in a higher income group slowed age-related declines by 8.2 years among men and up to 4.9 years among women. Conclusions This study adds new evidence from a developing Asian country regarding the difference in aging speeds across subpopulations associated with different levels of education and income."

Methods Design. A population-based cohort study. Setting. The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage [SAIL] databank in Wales, linking maternal primary care data with infant outcomes. Population. 107,573, 105,331, and 38,725 infants born 2000–2010 with information on premature birth, SGA and breastfeeding respectively, after exclusions. Exposures. maternal prescriptions for asthma medicines or their discontinuation in pregnancy. Methods. Odds ratios for adverse pregnancy outcomes were calculated for the exposed versus the unexposed population, adjusted for smoking, parity, age and socio-economic status. Results Prescriptions for asthma, whether continued or discontinued during pregnancy, were associated with birth at&lt;32 weeks’ gestation, SGA &lt;10th centile, and no breastfeeding (aOR 1.33 [1.10–1.61], 1.10 [1.03–1.18], 0.93 [0.87–1.01]). Discontinuation of asthma medicines in pregnancy was associated with birth at&lt;37 weeks’ and &lt;32 weeks’ gestation (aOR 1.22 [1.06–1.41], 1.53 [1.11–2.10]). All medicines examined, except ICS and SABA prescribed alone, were associated with SGA &lt;10th centile. Conclusions Prescription of asthma medicines before or during pregnancy was associated with higher prevalence of adverse perinatal outcomes, particularly if prescriptions were discontinued during pregnancy. Women discontinuing medicines during pregnancy could be identified from prescription records. The impact of targeting close monitoring and breastfeeding support warrants exploration."
https://openalex.org/W3113216786,"In 1996, an international group of representatives from national archives and libraries, universities, industry, publishing offices, and other government and private sector organizations first articulated the need for certified Trustworthy Digital Repositories (TDRs). Henceforth, multiple standards for TDRs have developed worldwide and their reviewers provide third party audit of digital repositories. Even though hundreds of repositories are currently certified, we do not know if audit and certification of TDRs actually matters. For example, we do not know if digital repositories are actually better at preserving digital information after certification than they were before. Additionally, we do not know if TDRs preserve digital information better than their counterparts, although TDR standards definitely promulgate this assumption. One way of assessing whether audit and certification of TDRs matters is to study its impact on TDRs’ stakeholders (e.g., funders, data producers, data consumers). As an initial critical step forward, this study examines what certification-related information repositories actually include on their websites since repository websites provide a means of disseminating information. Using findings from a content analysis of 91 TDR-certified repository websites, this research examines: 1) written statements about TDR status, 2) the presence of TDR seals and their location, 3) whether the seals hyperlink to additional certification information, 4) the extent to which the certification process is explained, and 5) whether audit reports are shared. Nearly three-fourths of the repository websites provide TDR status statements and put seals in one or more places; nearly 60% post audit reports and link seals to additional certification information; and over one-third explain the certification process. Directions for future research and practical application of the results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3112808984,"Place of death is an important outcome of end-of-life care. Many people do not have the opportunity to express their wishes and die in their preferred place of death. Advance care planning (ACP) involves discussion, decisions and documentation about how an individual contemplates their future death. Recording end-of-life preferences gives patients a sense of control over their future. Coordinate My Care (CMC) is London’s largest electronic palliative care register designed to provide effective ACP, with information being shared with urgent care providers. The aim of this study is to explore determinants of dying in hospital. Understanding advance plans and their outcomes can help in understanding the potential effects that implementation of electronic palliative care registers can have on the end-of-life care provided. Retrospective observational cohort analysis included 21,231 individuals aged 18 or older with a Coordinate My Care plan who had died between March 2011 and July 2019 with recorded place of death. Logistic regression was used to explore demographic and end-of-life preference factors associated with hospital deaths. 22% of individuals died in hospital and 73% have achieved preferred place of death. Demographic characteristics and end-of-life preferences have impact on dying in hospital, with the latter having the strongest influence. The likelihood of in-hospital death is substantially higher in patients without documented preferred place of death (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.26–1.62, p&lt;0.001), in those who prefer to die in hospital (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.60–3.30, p&lt;0.001) and who prefer to be cared in hospital (OR = 2.77, 95% CI 1.94–3.96, p&lt;0.001). “Not for resuscitation” individuals (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.37–0.50, p&lt;0.001) and who preferred symptomatic treatment (OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.33–0.40, p&lt;0.001) had a lower likelihood of in-hospital death. Effective advance care planning is necessary for improved end-of-life outcomes and should be included in routine clinical care. Electronic palliative care registers could empower patients by embedding patients’ wishes and personal circumstances in their care plans that are accessible by urgent care providers."

We investigated what resolutions people make when they are free to formulate them, whether different resolutions reach differing success rates, and whether it is possible to increase the likelihood of a resolution’s success by administering information and exercises on effective goal setting. Participants (N = 1066) from the general public were randomized into three groups: active control, some support, and extended support. The most popular resolutions regarded physical health, weight loss, and eating habits. At a one-year follow-up, 55% of responders considered themselves successful in sustaining their resolutions. Participants with approach-oriented goals were significantly more successful than those with avoidance-oriented goals (58.9% vs. 47.1%). The group that received some support was exclusively and significantly more successful compared to the other two. This study reveals that New Year’s resolutions can have lasting effects, even at a one-year follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3112021309,"L-Ascorbic acid (ascorbate, Vitamin C) is an essential human micronutrient that is predominantly obtained from plants. It is known to work as the major antioxidant in plants, and it underpins several environmentally induced stresses due to its use as a co-factor by certain 2-oxoglutarate-dependent (2-OG) dioxygenases [2(OG)-dioxygenases]. It is important to understand the role of 2(OG)-dioxygenases in the biosynthesis of ascorbate. The present study examined contents of ascorbate and protein-protein interaction in nine T-DNA mutants of Arabidopsis containing an insert in their respective (2-OG) dioxygenase genes ( At1g20270 , At1g68080 , At2g17720 , At3g06290 , At3g28490 , At4g35810 , At4g35820 , At5g18900 , At5g66060 ). In this study, the amount of ascorbate in five of the mutants was shown to be almost two-fold or more than two-fold higher than in the wild type. This result may be a consequence of the insertion of the T-DNA. The prediction of possible protein interactions between 2(OG)-dioxygenases and relevant ascorbate-function players may indicate the oxidative effects of certain dioxygenase proteins in plants. It is expected that certain dioxygenases are actively involved in the metabolic and biosynthetic pathways of ascorbate. This involvement may be of importance to increase ascorbate amounts in plants for human nutrition, and to protect plant species against stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3112191544,"The combination of ampicillin (AMP) and ceftriaxone (CRO) is considered synergistic against Enterococcus faecalis based on in vitro tests and the rabbit endocarditis model, however, in vitro assays are limited by the use of fixed antibiotic concentrations and the rabbit model by poor bacterial growth, high variability, and the use of point dose-effect estimations, that may lead to inaccurate assessment of antibiotic combinations and hinder optimal translation. Here, we tested AMP+CRO against two strains of E . faecalis and one of E . faecium in an optimized mouse thigh infection model that yields high bacterial growth and allows to define the complete dose-response relationship. By fitting Hill’s sigmoid model and estimating the parameters maximal effect (E max ) and effective dose 50 (ED 50 ), the following interactions were defined: synergism (E max increase ≥2 log 10 CFU/g), antagonism (E max reduction ≥1 log 10 CFU/g) and potentiation (ED 50 reduction ≥50% without changes in E max ). AMP monotherapy was effective against the three strains, yielding valid dose-response curves in terms of dose and the index f T &gt;MIC . CRO monotherapy showed no effect. The combination AMP+CRO against E . faecalis led to potentiation (59–81% ED 50 reduction) and not synergism (no changes in E max ). Against E . faecium , the combination was indifferent. The optimized mouse infection model allowed to obtain the complete dose-response curve of AMP+CRO and to define its interaction based on pharmacodynamic parameter changes. Integrating these results with the pharmacokinetics will allow to derive the PK/PD index bound to the activity of the combination, essential for proper translation to the clinic."

However, this pathogen also exhibits antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. This study aimed to characterize different virulence factors, secreted metabolites and to study their role in the suppression of Candida growth. Fifteen P . aeruginosa isolates were tested for their anticandidal activity against 3 different Candida spp. by the cross-streak method. The effect on hyphae production was tested microscopically using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Polymerase chain reaction was used in the detection of some virulence genes. Lipopolysaccharide profile was performed using SDS-polyacrylamide gel stained with silver. Fatty acids were analyzed by GC-MS as methyl ester derivatives. It was found that 5 P . aeruginosa isolates inhibited all tested Candida spp. (50–100% inhibition), one isolate inhibited C . glabrata only and 3 isolates showed no activity against the tested Candida spp. The P . aeruginosa isolates inhibiting all Candida spp. were positive for all virulence genes. GC-Ms analysis revealed that isolates with high anticandidal activity showed spectra for several compounds, each known for their antifungal activity in comparison to those with low or no anticandidal activity. Hence, clinical isolates of P . aeruginosa showed Candida species-specific interactions by different means, giving rise to the importance of studying microbial interaction in polymicrobial infections and their contribution to causing disease."
https://openalex.org/W3112611169,"Introduction Soil transmitted helminths (STH) can affect over 50% of children in some parts of Tanzania. Control measures involve annual deworming campaigns in schools, but re-infection is rapid. This paper presents the design and baseline survey results of an ongoing school-based cluster-randomised controlled trial in Kagera region, NW Tanzania. The trial aims to determine whether the effect of routine deworming on the prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura infections among school aged children can be sustained when combined with a behaviour change intervention promoting handwashing with water and soap. Methods As part of the trial, a total of 16 schools were randomised to receive the intervention (N = 8) or as controls (N = 8). Randomisation was stratified per district and restricted to ensure pre-trial STH prevalence was balanced between study arms. The combination intervention to be tested comprises class-room based teacher-led health education, improvement of handwash stations, coloured nudges to facilitate handwashing and parental engagement sessions. The impact evaluation involves two cross-sectional surveys conducted at baseline and endline. The objectives of the baseline survey were: (i) to confirm whether the deworming campaign was successful, and identify and treat students still infected about 2 weeks after deworming, (ii) to document any baseline differences in STH prevalence between trial arms, and (iii) to assess handwashing behaviours, and access to water and sanitation at school and home. We randomly sampled 35 students per class in Grades 1–6 (an average of 200 children per school), stratified to ensure equal representation between genders. Assenting students were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and asked to provide a stool specimen. Results Results of the baseline survey conducted about 2 weeks after deworming shows balanced demographic and STH prevalence data across trial arms. We observed a low prevalence of ascariasis (&lt; 5%) as expected; however, the prevalence of trichuriasis was still about 35% in both arms. Conclusion The randomisation procedure was successful in achieving a balanced distribution of demographic characteristics and helminth infections between trial arms. The intervention is being rolled out. The current deworming treatment regimen may need to be revised with regards to the treatment of trichuriasis."

Conclusions The patient with appendicitis was older and had peritonitis, higher preoperative WBC count or CRP level, longer time from diagnosis to surgery, appendicolith, and complicated appendicitis, predicting a prolonged hospital stay. Shorter surgical time and the use of silk ligation for stump closure and cephalosporins + metronidazole for antibiotic treatment might be better choices to obtain a shorter hospital stay."
https://openalex.org/W3081931604,"Lexical borrowing, the transfer of words from one language to another, is one of the most frequent processes in language evolution. In order to detect borrowings, linguists make use of various strategies, combining evidence from various sources. Despite the increasing popularity of computational approaches in comparative linguistics, automated approaches to lexical borrowing detection are still in their infancy, disregarding many aspects of the evidence that is routinely considered by human experts. One example for this kind of evidence are phonological and phonotactic clues that are especially useful for the detection of recent borrowings that have not yet been adapted to the structure of their recipient languages. In this study, we test how these clues can be exploited in automated frameworks for borrowing detection. By modeling phonology and phonotactics with the support of Support Vector Machines, Markov models, and recurrent neural networks, we propose a framework for the supervised detection of borrowings in mono-lingual wordlists. Based on a substantially revised dataset in which lexical borrowings have been thoroughly annotated for 41 different languages from different families, featuring a large typological diversity, we use these models to conduct a series of experiments to investigate their performance in mono-lingual borrowing detection. While the general results appear largely unsatisfying at a first glance, further tests show that the performance of our models improves with increasing amounts of attested borrowings and in those cases where most borrowings were introduced by one donor language alone. Our results show that phonological and phonotactic clues derived from monolingual language data alone are often not sufficient to detect borrowings when using them in isolation. Based on our detailed findings, however, we express hope that they could prove to be useful in integrated approaches that take multi-lingual information into account."
https://openalex.org/W3112269946,"The coexistence of sessile, tube-dwelling polychaetes (serpulids) and hydroids, has been investigated. Serpulid tubes bearing traces after hydroids are derived from different stratigraphic intervals spanning the Middle and Upper Jurassic, the rocks of which represent the diverse paleoenvironments of the Polish Basin. Although fossil colonial hydroids classified under the species Protulophila gestroi are a commonly occurring symbiont of these polychaetes during the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, they seem to be significantly less frequent during the Jurassic and limited to specific paleoenvironments. The hydroids described here are represented by traces after a thin stolonal network with elongated polyp chambers that open to the outer polychaete tube’s surface with small, more or less subcircular apertures. Small chimney-like bulges around openings are an effect of the incorporation of the organism by in vivo embedment (bioclaustration) within the outer layers of the calcareous tube of the serpulid host. Considering the rich collection of well-preserved serpulid tubes (&gt;3000 specimens), the frequency of bioclaustrated hydroids is very low, with an infestation percentage of only 0.6% (20 cases). It has been noticed that only specimens of the genus Propomatoceros from the Upper Bajocian, Lower Bathonian, Middle Bathonian, and Callovian have been found infested. However, the majority of bioclaustrated hydroids (17 cases) have been recorded in the Middle Bathonian serpulid species Propomatoceros lumbricalis coming from a single sampled site. Representatives of other genera are not affected, which is congruent with previous reports indicating that Protulophila gestroi was strongly selective in the choice of its host. A presumably commensal relationship is compared with the recent symbiosis between the hydroids of the genus Proboscidactyla and certain genera of sabellid polychaetes."

https://openalex.org/W3112617950,"Ewing sarcoma is a pediatric bone cancer that expresses the chimeric protein EWSR1/FLI1. We previously demonstrated that EWSR1/FLI1 impairs the localization of Aurora B kinase to the midzone (the midline structure located between segregating chromosomes) during anaphase. While localization of Aurora B is essential for faithful cell division, it is unknown whether interference with midzone organization by EWSR1/FLI1 induces aneuploidy. To address this, we generated stable Tet-on inducible cell lines with EWSR1/FLI1, using CRISPR/Cas9 technology to integrate the transgene at the safe-harbor AAVS1 locus in DLD-1 cells. Induced cells expressing EWSR1/FLI1 displayed an increased incidence of aberrant localization of Aurora B, and greater levels of aneuploidy, compared with noninduced cells. Furthermore, the expression of EWSR1/FLI1-T79A, containing a threonine (Thr) to alanine (Ala) substitution at amino acid 79, failed to induce these phenotypes, indicating that Thr 79 is critical for EWSR1/FLI1 interference with mitosis. In contrast, the phosphomimetic mutant EWSR1/FLI1-T79D (Thr to aspartic acid (Asp)) retained the high activity as wild-type EWSR1/FLI1. Together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of EWSR1/FLI1 at Thr 79 promotes the colocalization of EWSR1/FLI1 and Aurora B on the chromosomes during prophase and metaphase and, in addition, impairs the localization of Aurora B during anaphase, leading to induction of aneuploidy. This is the first demonstration of the mechanism for EWSR1/FLI1-dependent induction of aneuploidy associated with mitotic dysfunction and the identification of the phosphorylation of the Thr 79 of EWSR1/FLI1 as a critical residue required for this induction.

Together, these findings suggest that phosphorylation of EWSR1/FLI1 at Thr 79 promotes the colocalization of EWSR1/FLI1 and Aurora B on the chromosomes during prophase and metaphase and, in addition, impairs the localization of Aurora B during anaphase, leading to induction of aneuploidy. This is the first demonstration of the mechanism for EWSR1/FLI1-dependent induction of aneuploidy associated with mitotic dysfunction and the identification of the phosphorylation of the Thr 79 of EWSR1/FLI1 as a critical residue required for this induction. Ewing sarcoma is a pediatric bone cancer that displays a characteristic small round blue cell morphology (1Ewing J. Classics in oncology. Diffuse endothelioma of bone. James Ewing.

An early investigation of the disease demonstrated that patient cells express an aberrant EWSR1/FLI1 fusion gene composed of the N-terminal coding region of the EWS RNA Binding Protein 1/Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1 (EWSR1) gene and the C-terminal coding region of the FLI-1 Proto-Oncogene, ETS Transcription Factor (FLI1) gene (2Delattre O.

The genomics of Ewing sarcomas have been extensively studied, and several genes have been identified as frequently mutated in these tumors. For example, mutations in STAG2 have been identified in 17% of patients, mutations in CDKN2A were found in 12% of patients, and mutations in TP53 were found in 7% of patients (19Brohl A.S.

While the mutations in these genes are thought to play an important role in disease progression, the low incidence of secondary mutations suggests the existence of an alternative mechanism driving pathogenesis. One understudied phenomenon is the high incidence of aneuploidy observed in Ewing sarcoma. These changes include the gain of chromosome 8 in 47% of patients, the gain of chromosome 21 in 21% of patients, and the loss of part of chromosome 16 in 17% of patients (20Tirode F. Surdez D. Ma X.

Although the tumor cells display a high incidence of aneuploidy, it is unclear whether aneuploidy is induced in the early stages of tumorigenesis and promotes the progression of the disease, or if it is a by-product of tumorigenesis and expands during tumor progression. Aneuploidy is the result of abnormal chromosome segregation, which may be caused by the failure of any of several mitotic processes (including chromosome cohesion; mitotic spindle (K-fiber) attachment to the kinetochore of the chromosome; the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC); the amplification of centrosomes; or cytokinesis accompanied by defects in midbody structure) (23Khmelinskii A. Schiebel E. Assembling the spindle midzone in the right place at the right time.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24Nicholson J.M. Macedo J.C. Mattingly A.J.

Chromosome mis-segregation and cytokinesis failure in trisomic human cells.Elife. 2015; 4: e05068Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that EWSR1/FLI1 impairs the recruitment of the key mitotic regulator Aurora B kinase to the midzone, (the network of antiparallel microtubules and midzone proteins located between segregating chromosomes during anaphase) (25Park H. Turkalo T.K. Nelson K. Folmsbee S.S. Robb C. Belford B. Azuma M. Ewing sarcoma EWS protein regulates midzone formation by recruiting Aurora B kinase to the midzone.Cell Cycle. 2014; 13: 2391-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is known that impaired localization of Aurora B to the midzone leads to multiple defects, including flawed cytokinesis due to structural defects in the midbody, uneven chromosome segregation, and the induction of aneuploidy (26Severson A.F. Hamill D.R. Carter J.C. Schumacher J. Bowerman B. The aurora-related kinase AIR-2 recruits ZEN-4/CeMKLP1 to the mitotic spindle at metaphase and is required for cytokinesis.Curr.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Therefore, mitotic dysfunction induced by EWSR1/FLI1 may play a critical role in the induction of Ewing sarcoma. To begin our investigations into the induction of aneuploidy by EWSR1/FLI1, we generated Tet-on EWSR1/FLI1 inducible cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas 9 system (29Mali P. Yang L. Esvelt K.M. Aach J. Guell M. DiCarlo J.E. Norville J.E. Church G.M. RNA-guided human genome engineering via Cas9.Science. 2013; 339: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5508) Google Scholar). These cell lines allowed us to coordinate the phase of the cell cycle and the expression of EWSR1/FLI1. Here, we demonstrate that EWSR1/FLI1 expression leads to impaired Aurora B-localization and to the induction of aneuploidy after 1 cell cycle after induction of EWSR1/FLI1 expression, suggesting that it is an early event in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, amino acid residue Thr 79 (T79) of EWSR1/FLI1 is essential for 1) colocalization of the fusion protein with Aurora B during metaphase; 2) impaired localization of Aurora B during anaphase; and 3) the induction of aneuploidy. Surprisingly, substitution of amino acid T79 of EWSR1/FLI1 with alanine abolished the ability of the cells to induce these phenotypes, whereas expression of EWSR1/FLI1-T79D (containing the phosphomimetic substitution of Asp for Thr 79) retained the high activity as wild-type EWSR1/FLI1. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Thr 79 of EWSR1/FLI1 is critical for induction of aneuploidy, likely by facilitating the localization of the fusion protein on the chromosomes, leading to mitotic dysfunction. Our discovery may provide a mechanism to account for the high incidence of aneuploidy observed in Ewing sarcoma and thus contributes to the understanding of the pathogenesis of this devastating disease. To provide insight into the mechanism of EWSR1/FLI1-mediated mitotic dysfunction through impaired Aurora B localization, we initiated our study by identifying the point mutant of EWSR1/FLI1 that lacks the ability to induce aberrant localization of Aurora B. Using mutant constructs to identify the amino acid residues of the fusion protein that are responsible for induction of midzone defects is an effective approach for understanding protein function. Once identified, the critical mutant construct serves as a negative control or positive control in experiments to dissect the pathways involved. Because our previous study showed that the N terminus of EWSR1/FLI1 is required to induce mitotic defects, we used a candidate approach to investigate the critical residues of the fusion protein (30Embree L.J. Azuma M. Hickstein D.D. Ewing sarcoma fusion protein EWSR1/FLI1 interacts with EWSR1 leading to mitotic defects in zebrafish embryos and human cell lines.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4363-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We investigated residue Thr 79 of EWSR1/FLI1, which is located in the N terminus of the molecule (derived from EWSR1 sequence), because it is a known site for posttranslational modifications. Thr 79 is phosphorylated when cells expressing EWSR1/FLI1 are treated with a DNA-damaging agent (31Klevernic I.V. Morton S. Davis R.J. Cohen P. Phosphorylation of Ewing's sarcoma protein (EWS) and EWS-Fli1 in response to DNA damage.Biochem. J. 2009; 418: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thr 79 is also a potential site for O-GlcNAcylation, which affects the expression of Inhibitor of DNA Binding 2 (ID2) (32Bachmaier R. Aryee D.N. Jug G. Kauer M. Kreppel M. Lee K.A. Kovar H. O-GlcNAcylation is involved in the transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI1 in Ewing's sarcoma.Oncogene. 2009; 28: 1280-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We generated DNA constructs with EWSR1/FLI1 and with amino acid substitutions at residue 79 in EWSR1/FLI1. The substitution constructs had a Thr to Ala substitution (T79A) or a Thr to Asp substitution (T79D; phosphomimetic mutation). Using these three DNA constructs, we established stable Tet-on cell lines by integrating EWSR1/FLI1, EWSR1/FLI1-T79A, and EWSR1/FLI1-T79D transgenes (each with an mCherry tag) into the safe-harbor AAVS1 locus of DLD-1 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 technology (Fig. 1A) (29Mali P.

The DLD-1 colorectal cancer cell line was chosen because it does not express EWSR1/FLI1 endogenously, and because it has a near-diploid karyotype, it has been used as a model to evaluate proteins of interest for their ability to induce aneuploidy (24Nicholson J.M. Macedo J.C. Mattingly A.J. Wangsa D. Camps J. Lima V. Gomes A.M. Doria S. Ried T. Logarinho E. Cimini D.

Genetic instability in colorectal cancers.Nature. 1997; 386: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). The inducible system enabled us to assess the activity of EWSR1/FLI1 in the induction of aneuploidy after a single cell cycle. Expression of EWSR1/FLI1, EWSR1/FLI1-T79A, and EWSR1/FLI1-T79D was verified in induced cells by western blot using an anti-FLI1 antibody and by immunocytochemistry using antibodies against the mCherry tags (Fig. 1, B–C). We initiated the study by characterizing the EWSR1/FLI1 and EWSR1/FLI1-T79A lines. The cells at mitosis were obtained by using the thymidine and by releasing for 9 h (Fig. S1A). First, the localizations of EWSR1/FLI1 and EWSR1/FLI1-T79A were documented using single Z-section images for each sample. In the EWSR1/FLI1 expressing (Dox+) cells, most mCherry positive cells displayed mCherry signal in prominent foci over the chromosomes during prophase and metaphase and signal in the cytoplasm. However, in cells induced to express EWSR1/FLI1-T79A (Dox+), the fluorescent signal in most of the mCherry positive cells was observed less on the chromosomes but was observed mainly in the cytoplasm during both prophase and metaphase (Fig. 2, A–B). During anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis, both the EWSR1/FLI1-mCherry and the EWSR1/FLI1-T79A-mCherry signals localized on the chromosomes (Fig. 2, A–B). Together, these results suggest that residue T79 of EWSR1/FLI1 is critical for localization to the chromosomes during early mitosis. To verify this observation, the localization of EWSR1/FLI1 and EWSR1/FLI1-T79A was further analyzed using a biochemical approach. Both cell lines were treated with Dox (or left untreated), synchronized using the thymidine/nocodazole protocol, and released for 30 min (Fig. S1B). The cells were lysed and directly used as whole-cell lysate or fractionated into cytoplasm and chromosome fractions, and all of the samples were subjected to western blot using anti-FLI1 antibody. (Note that DLD-1 cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous FLI1, thus the antibody specifically recognizes both EWSR1/FLI1 and EWSR1/FLI1-T79A). Consistent with the observations using immunocytochemistry, the FLI1 signal appears in the chromosome fraction in Dox treated cells expressing EWSR1/FLI1, and there is virtually no signal in this fraction for the EWSR1/FLI1-T79A (Dox+) sample (Fig. 2C). Quantification of the band intensity for the EWSR1/FLI1 and EWSR1/FLI1-T79A signals in the chromosome fractions obtained from three experiments revealed that the intensity of the EWSR1/FLI1-T79A signal was significantly lower than that of EWSR1/FLI1 (defined as 1.0) (Fig. 2D). Note that the expression level of the EWSR1/FLI1-T79A is higher than that of EWSR1/FLI1 (Fig. 2C whole-cell lysate); however, the localization of EWSR1/FLI1-T79A on the chromosome was significantly lower than that of EWSR1/FLI1. Therefore, the result suggests that the localization of the EWSR1/FLI1 on the chromosome is not regulated by the level of the protein, but the residue Thr 79 is required for EWSR1/FLI1 to localize to chromosomes during mitosis. This is the first evidence that EWSR1/FLI1 is recruited to the chromosome in a Thr 79 site-specific manner. To address whether the localization of EWSR1/FLI1 on the chromosome correlates with the localization of Aurora B, Dox-treated EWSR1/FLI1 and EWSR1/FLI1-T79A DLD-1 cell lines were prepared by the same thymidine protocol described in Fig. S1A. Then, the cells were subjected to immunocytochemistry using anti-mCherry and Alexa Fluor 594 antibodies and anti-Aurora B and Alexa Fluor 488 antibodies. Single Z-section images of the cells were obtained, and areas with overlapping signals for mCherry and Aurora B were analyzed using the pixelmap function of Fiji Imaging software. We identified a significantly broader area of overlapping signals (shown in white in Fig. 3A, top row, far-right panel) in EWSR1/FLI1 expressing cells compared with cells expressing EWSR1/FLI1-T79A (Fig. 3A, bottom row, far-right panel). The covariance for Aurora B (green) and mCherry (red) signals was determined using the Pearson Coefficient. Dox-treated cells expressing EWSR1/FLI1 (n = 11 cells) show a significantly higher correlation of localization than cells expressing EWSR1/FLI1-T79A (n = 12 cells) (Fig. 3B). The result suggests that residue Thr 79 is essential for the colocalization between EWSR1/FLI1 and Aurora B. To determine whether the newly established stable lines recapitulate our previous results of defect on midzone localization of Aurora B using transient expression of EWSR1/FLI1, the stable cell lines were treated with Doxycycline (Dox), followed by immunocytochemistry using an anti-Aurora B antibody and an anti-mCherry antibody to visualize the transgene (30Embree L.J. Azuma M. Hickstein D.D. Ewing sarcoma fusion protein EWSR1/FLI1 interacts with EWSR1 leading to mitotic defects in zebrafish embryos and human cell lines.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4363-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The localization of Aurora B was analyzed by visually scoring the percentage of cells displaying misaligned Aurora B signal at the midzone. Consistent with our previous report using Ewing sarcoma A673 cells and HeLa cells, the DLD-1 cells that were induced to express EWSR1/FLI1 (Dox+) displayed a greater incidence of aberrant Aurora B localization than uninduced (Dox-) cells (Fig. 4, A–B) (25Park H.

Ewing sarcoma fusion protein EWSR1/FLI1 interacts with EWSR1 leading to mitotic defects in zebrafish embryos and human cell lines.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4363-4371Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We scored 50 anaphase cells per sample, in each of three replicate experiments. In Dox-induced cells expressing EWSR1/FLI1, the percentage of cells displaying aberrant Aurora B localization was significantly higher (49 ± 4%) compared with that observed in noninduced (Dox-) cells (37 ± 6%, p < 0.05) (Fig. 4B). Next, we examined the effect of the T79A residue substitution on midzone formation. The EWSR1/FLI1-T79A expression did not affect the symmetric distribution of Aurora B signal along the midline (Fig. 4A). The EWSR1/FLI1-T79A expressing cells did not display a significant change in their incidence of Aurora B mislocalization (33 ± 2%) compared with that observed in noninduced cells (32 ± 4%, p > 0.05) (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that amino acid Thr 79 of EWSR1/FLI1 is critical to induce mislocalization of Aurora B at the midzone during anaphase. We investigated whether EWSR1/FLI1 induces aneuploidy and whether Thr 79 is involved in this induction. Because the doubling time of DLD-1 cell is approximately 20 h, and the maximum induction of EWSR1/FLI1 by doxycycline takes approximately 20 h, the stable DLD-1 cell lines were treated with Dox or left untreated for 48 h to assess whether the EWSR1/FLI1 induces aneuploidy after one cell cycle (Fig. 5A) (35Leith J.T. Gaskins L.A. Dexter D.L. Calabresi P. Glicksman A.S. Alteration of the survival response of two human colon carcinoma subpopulations to x-irradiation by N,N-dimethylformamide.Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 30-34PubMed Google Scholar). The samples were subjected to a metaphase chromosome spreading protocol, followed by visualization of the chromosomes with DAPI. The total number of chromosomes in the cells of each sample group were then scored (Fig. 5B). The majority (81 ± 2%) of EWSR1/FLI1 expressing (Dox+) cells contained aberrant numbers of chromosomes, unlike the negative control (Dox-) cells, in which only 30 ± 5% displayed abnormal numbers of chromosomes. Conversely, there was no significant difference in the percentage of cells that displayed aberrant numbers of chromosomes between the EWSR1/FLI1-T79A expressing (Dox+) cells (39 ± 12%) and the control (Dox-) cells (32 ± 8%, p > 0.05) (Fig. 5C). The majority of cells in the EWSR1/FLI1 (Dox-) sample, the EWSR1/FLI1-T79A (Dox-) sample, and the EWSR1/FLI1-T79A (Dox+) sample had 46 chromosomes (Fig. 5D). In contrast, the majority of cells expressing EWSR1/FLI1 (Dox+) had nondiploid chromosome counts (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that EWSR1/FLI1 induces aneuploidy and that the Thr 79 residue of EWSR1/FLI1 plays a critical role in this defect. The characterization of the EWSR1/FLI1-T79A cell line suggested that residue Thr 79 of EWSR1/FLI1 plays a critical role in the regulation of Aurora B during metaphase and anaphase and in the induction of aneuploidy. Because Thr is known to be phosphorylated, we sought to determine whether the phosphorylation of amino acid Thr 79 of EWSR1/FLI1 could promote the mislocalization of Aurora B during mitosis and the induction of aneuploidy. To address this, we analyzed the phosphomimetic EWSR1/FLI1-T79D mutant line, which has a Thr to Asp substitution at residue 79, and compared its activity with that of EWSR1/FLI1. The localization of EWSR1/FLI1 and EWSR1/FLI1-T79D was analyzed during mitosis. The cells were synchronized using thymidine protoco"

By using Ott-Antonsen ansatz, we reduce the globally coupled phase oscillators to low dimensional coupled ordinary differential equations. For symmetrical bimodal frequency distribution, we analyze the stabilities of the incoherent state and different partial synchronous states. Different types of bifurcations are identified and the effect of the phase lag on the dynamics is investigated. For asymmetrical bimodal frequency distribution, we observe the revival of the incoherent state, and then the conditions for the revival are specified."

The unique material properties of each silk type result from differences in amino acid sequence and structure of their component proteins, primarily spidroins (spider fibrous proteins). Amino acid content and gene expression measurements of spider silks suggest some spiders change expression patterns of individual protein components in response to environmental cues. We quantified mRNA abundance of three spidroin encoding genes involved in prey capture in the common house spider, Parasteatoda tepidariorum (Theridiidae), fed different diets. After 10 days of acclimation to the lab on a diet of mealworms, spiders were split into three groups: (1) individuals were immediately dissected, (2) spiders were fed high-energy crickets, or (3) spiders were fed low-energy flies, for 1 month. All spiders gained mass during the acclimation period and cricket-fed spiders continued to gain mass, while fly-fed spiders either maintained or lost mass. Using quantitative PCR, we found no significant differences in the absolute or relative abundance of dragline gene transcripts, major ampullate spidroin 1 ( MaSp1 ) and major ampullate spidroin 2 ( MaSp2 ), among groups. In contrast, prey-wrapping minor ampullate spidroin ( MiSp) gene transcripts were significantly less abundant in fly-fed than lab-acclimated spiders. However, when measured relative to Actin , cricket-fed spiders showed the lowest expression of MiSp . Our results suggest that house spiders are able to maintain silk production, even in the face of a low-quality diet."
https://openalex.org/W3111345251,"In this paper, a (Fe 50 Mn 30 Co 10 Cr 10 ) 100-x C x high-entropy alloy (HEA) was successfully prepared by using the vacuum arc melting method. The peak shape analysis of the X-ray diffraction patterns, the EBSD observations, and the EDS spectra of the alloys with different compositions show that the characteristics of the dendrites and the hard phase, Cr 23 C 6 , into the initial single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) matrix becomes gradually visible as the carbon content increases from 0 to 4%. The crystal phase variations lead to a non-linear orientation of the microstructure, to a refinement of the grains, and to a higher elastic modulus. This study presents the solid saturation limit of the interstitial carbon atoms in such alloys and establishes an empirical relation between an alloy’s elastic modulus and its carbon content."
https://openalex.org/W3112538262,"Extracts made from the skin of dead Lithodytes lineatus frog individuals with the application of the benzocaine-based anesthetic gel, introduced into the oral cavity, were analyzed by 1 H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance to investigate whether the application of this product (oral) can make studies that use extracts from the skins of these animals unfeasible. For comparison, we used skins of another species of anuran following the same death protocol. No trace of the benzocaine substance was found in the 1 H-NMR spectra of the skin extracts from any of the tested anuran species. Still, using the hierarchical clustering model, it was possible to observe the formation of well-defined groups between the skin extracts of anurans and the anesthetic used to kill these animals. Our results suggest that the lethal dose of benzocaine in gel used inside the mouth of frogs may have no influence on potential results regarding the chemical composition or even bioassays using extracts made from the skin of these animals killed under this protocol since there was no detection of this substance for the analyzed samples."
https://openalex.org/W3112804500,"Background Treatment for peritoneal malignancy (PM) can include cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and heated intrapertioneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and is associated with morbidity and mortality. Physical, psychological and nutritional outcomes are important pre-operatively. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate these outcomes in patients with PM before and after CRS-HIPEC. Methods Between June 2018 and November 2019, participants were recruited to a single-centre study. Primary outcome was cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) variables oxygen uptake (VO 2 ) at anaerobic threshold (AT) and at peak. Secondary outcome measures were upper and lower body strength, health related quality of life (HRQoL) and the surgical fear questionnaire. Exploratory outcomes included body mass index, nutrient intake and post-operative outcome. All participants were asked to undertake assessments pre CRS-HIPEC and 12 weeks following the procedure. Results Thirty-nine patients were screened, 38 were eligible and 16 were recruited. Ten female and 6 male, median (IQR) age 53 (42–63) years. Of the 16 patients recruited, 14 proceeded with CRS-HIPEC and 10 competed the follow up assessment at week 12. Pre-operative VO 2 at AT and peak was 16.8 (13.7–18) ml.kg -1 .min -1 and 22.2 (19.3–25.3) ml.kg -1 .min -1 , upper body strength was 25.9 (20.3–41.5) kg, lower body strength was 14 (10.4–20.3) sec, HRQoL (overall health status) was 72.5 (46.3–80) % whilst overall surgical fear was 39 (30.5–51). The VO 2 at AT decreased significantly (p = 0.05) and HRQoL improved (p = 0.04) between pre and post- CRS-HIPEC. There were no significant differences for any of the other outcome measures. Conclusion This pilot study showed a significant decrease in VO 2 at AT and an improvement in overall HRQoL at the 12 week follow up. The findings will inform a larger study design to investigate a prehabilitation and rehabilitation cancer survivorship programme."
https://openalex.org/W3111497537,"Identifying individuals with natural markings is increasing in popularity to non-invasively support population studies. However, applying natural variation among individuals requires careful evaluation among target species, snakes for example have little validation of such methods. Here we introduce a mark-free identification method for King Cobras ( Ophiophagus hannah ) from the Sakaerat Biosphere Reserve, in northeast Thailand using both subcaudal scale pholidosis (scale arrangement and number) and unique ventral body markings to distinguish individuals. This project aims to evaluate the impact of observer error on individual identification. Observers of varying expertise, will distinguish between King Cobra individuals using identifying photographs from a previous study. We will ask randomly assigned observers to distinguish individuals via: 1) subcaudal pholidosis, 2) ventral body markings, and 3) combination of both measures. Using Bayesian logistic regression, we will assess the probability observers correctly distinguish individuals. Based on exploratory observations, we hypothesise that there will be a high probability of correct identifications using subcaudal pholidosis and ventral body markings. We aim to stimulate other studies implementing identification techniques for scrutinous assessment of such methods, in order to avoid subsequent errors during long-term population studies."
