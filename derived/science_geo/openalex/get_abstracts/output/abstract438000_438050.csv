https://openalex.org/W2161884651,"Pancreatic cancer is a highly lethal malignancy with few effective therapies. We performed exome sequencing and copy number analysis to define genomic aberrations in a prospectively accrued clinical cohort (n = 142) of early (stage I and II) sporadic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Detailed analysis of 99 informative tumours identified substantial heterogeneity with 2,016 non-silent mutations and 1,628 copy-number variations. We define 16 significantly mutated genes, reaffirming known mutations (KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, MLL3, TGFBR2, ARID1A and SF3B1), and uncover novel mutated genes including additional genes involved in chromatin modification (EPC1 and ARID2), DNA damage repair (ATM) and other mechanisms (ZIM2, MAP2K4, NALCN, SLC16A4 and MAGEA6). Integrative analysis with in vitro functional data and animal models provided supportive evidence for potential roles for these genetic aberrations in carcinogenesis. Pathway-based analysis of recurrently mutated genes recapitulated clustering in core signalling pathways in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and identified new mutated genes in each pathway. We also identified frequent and diverse somatic aberrations in genes described traditionally as embryonic regulators of axon guidance, particularly SLIT/ROBO signalling, which was also evident in murine Sleeping Beauty transposon-mediated somatic mutagenesis models of pancreatic cancer, providing further supportive evidence for the potential involvement of axon guidance genes in pancreatic carcinogenesis. Exome sequencing and copy number analysis are used to define genomic aberrations in early sporadic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; among the findings are mutations in genes involved in chromatin modification and DNA damage repair, and frequent and diverse somatic aberrations in genes known as embryonic regulators of axon guidance. This large-scale study presents exome sequencing and copy number variant analysis from 142 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, the most common form of pancreatic cancer. Among the findings are mutations in genes involved in chromatin modification and DNA damage repair, not previously implicated in this disease. Importantly, the data show that abnormal expression of genes involved in slit and semaphorin signalling is associated with poor patient survival, and in animal models was associated with disease development and progression."

https://openalex.org/W2082967251,"The results of sequencing the collared flycatcher genome, and re-sequencing population samples from this species and its sister species, the pied flycatcher, reveal the existence of areas of high sequence divergence compared to background levels, and suggest that complex repeat structures may drive species divergence and that sex chromosomes and autosomes are at different stages of speciation. Flycatchers are important models for speciation. To provide genome-wide insight into the divergence that occurred between lineages during speciation, Hans Ellegren et al. have sequenced the pied flycatcher genome and re-sequenced population samples from this and another species. The results reveal the existence of 'divergence islands' — with fiftyfold higher sequence divergence than the genomic background — non-randomly distributed across the genome. Natural selection acting in both lineages drives divergence in these regions. The authors also report the unexpected observation that targets for selection may not be genes, and may instead be centromeric and telomeric repeats. Unravelling the genomic landscape of divergence between lineages is key to understanding speciation1. The naturally hybridizing collared flycatcher and pied flycatcher are important avian speciation models2,3,4,5,6,7 that show pre- as well as postzygotic isolation8,9. We sequenced and assembled the 1.1-Gb flycatcher genome, physically mapped the assembly to chromosomes using a low-density linkage map10 and re-sequenced population samples of each species. Here we show that the genomic landscape of species differentiation is highly heterogeneous with approximately 50 ‘divergence islands’ showing up to 50-fold higher sequence divergence than the genomic background. These non-randomly distributed islands, with between one and three regions of elevated divergence per chromosome irrespective of chromosome size, are characterized by reduced levels of nucleotide diversity, skewed allele-frequency spectra, elevated levels of linkage disequilibrium and reduced proportions of shared polymorphisms in both species, indicative of parallel episodes of selection. Proximity of divergence peaks to genomic regions resistant to sequence assembly, potentially including centromeres and telomeres, indicate that complex repeat structures may drive species divergence. A much higher background level of species divergence of the Z chromosome, and a lower proportion of shared polymorphisms, indicate that sex chromosomes and autosomes are at different stages of speciation. This study provides a roadmap to the emerging field of speciation genomics."

Ca2+ uptake is driven by the considerable voltage present across the inner membrane (ΔΨm) generated by proton pumping by the respiratory chain. Mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ concentration is maintained five to six orders of magnitude lower than its equilibrium level, but the molecular mechanisms for how this is achieved are not clear. Here, we demonstrate that the mitochondrial protein MICU1 is required to preserve normal [Ca2+]m under basal conditions. In its absence, mitochondria become constitutively loaded with Ca2+, triggering excessive reactive oxygen species generation and sensitivity to apoptotic stress. MICU1 interacts with the uniporter pore-forming subunit MCU and sets a Ca2+ threshold for Ca2+m uptake without affecting the kinetic properties of MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake.

Ca2+ uptake is an electrogenic process driven by ΔΨm and mediated by a Ca2+-selective ion channel (MiCa; Kirichok et al., 2004Kirichok Y. Krapivinsky G. Clapham D.E.

Acta. 2010; 1797: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Properties of the uniporter have been derived primarily from studies of isolated mitochondria, where it was generally found to have a low apparent Ca2+ affinity (10–70 μM) with variable cooperativity (Bragadin et al., 1979Bragadin M.

Agonist-induced [Ca2+]i signals can be rapidly transduced to the mitochondrial matrix despite this apparent low affinity because mitochondria can exist in close apposition to sites of Ca2+ release where local [Ca2+]i can be higher than in the bulk cytoplasm (Carafoli and Lehninger, 1971Carafoli E.

Nevertheless, higher-affinity mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has been observed in many studies (Santo-Domingo and Demaurex, 2010Santo-Domingo J. Demaurex N. Calcium uptake mechanisms of mitochondria.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1797: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar; Spät et al., 2008Spät A. Szanda G. Csordás G. Hajnóczky G. High- and low-calcium-dependent mechanisms of mitochondrial calcium signalling.Cell Calcium. 2008; 44: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, patch-clamp electrophysiology suggests that the uniporter pore has high Ca2+ affinity (dissociation constant <2 nM) that enables it to have high Ca2+ selectivity (Kirichok et al., 2004Kirichok Y. Krapivinsky G. Clapham D.E. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a highly selective ion channel.Nature. 2004; 427: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). In addition, the open probability of the uniporter channel is voltage dependent, reaching nearly unity at normal ΔΨm (∼−180mV) (Kirichok et al., 2004Kirichok Y. Krapivinsky G. Clapham D.E. The mitochondrial calcium uniporter is a highly selective ion channel.Nature. 2004; 427: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas rapid and substantial Ca2+m uptake can take place in regions of high [Ca2+]i microdomains, the high open probability and Ca2+ affinity of the uniporter pore suggest that the large thermodynamic driving force for Ca2+ uptake would result in Ca2+m overload in the absence of regulatory mechanisms to limit the activity of the channel. However, the identity of such mechanisms remains elusive. Until recently, the molecular identity of the uniporter was unknown. MICU1 was identified as a protein that localized to the IMM and was suggested to be required for uniporter-mediated Ca2+ uptake (Perocchi et al., 2010Perocchi F. Gohil V.M. Girgis H.S. Bao X.R. McCombs J.E. Palmer A.E. Mootha V.K. MICU1 encodes a mitochondrial EF hand protein required for Ca(2+) uptake.Nature. 2010; 467: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Subsequently, MCU was identified as the likely ion-conducting pore of the uniporter (Baughman et al., 2011Baughman J.M. Perocchi F. Girgis H.S. Plovanich M. Belcher-Timme C.A. Sancak Y. Bao X.R. Strittmatter L. Goldberger O. Bogorad R.L. et al.Integrative genomics identifies MCU as an essential component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.Nature. 2011; 476: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar; De Stefani et al., 2011De Stefani D. Raffaello A. Teardo E. Szabò I. Rizzuto R. A forty-kilodalton protein of the inner membrane is the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.Nature. 2011; 476: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). MICU1 and MCU biochemically interact, and their expression patterns are tightly coupled across tissues and species (Baughman et al., 2011Baughman J.M. Perocchi F. Girgis H.S. Plovanich M. Belcher-Timme C.A. Sancak Y. Bao X.R. Strittmatter L. Goldberger O. Bogorad R.L. et al.Integrative genomics identifies MCU as an essential component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.Nature. 2011; 476: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the functional relationship between these two uniporter components is unknown. Here, we report that loss of MICU1 leads to constitutive Ca2+m accumulation through MCU. MICU1 is not required for MCU-mediated Ca2+m uptake. Instead, MICU1 is a gatekeeper for MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake, establishing a threshold (the set point) that prevents Ca2+ uptake in low [Ca2+]i (<3 μM) but does not confer low apparent Ca2+ affinity or cooperativity of MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake at higher [Ca2+]i. MICU1 regulation of MCU requires each of its Ca2+-binding EF hands, suggesting that they provide the high-affinity [Ca2+] sensing mechanism that enables MICU1 to exert its regulation. MICU1 senses matrix [Ca2+] because it inhibits MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake only when [Ca2+]m is low. These findings reveal a previously unknown role of MICU1 as a gatekeeper to limit MCU-mediated Ca2+ influx to prevent Ca2+m overload and its associated stress under resting conditions. HeLa cells were transfected with MICU1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Table S1 available online) to silence its expression or with a nontargeting scrambled siRNA as control (Figure S1A). Strikingly, [Ca2+]m was constitutively elevated under resting conditions in MICU1 knockdown (KD) cells (Figures S1B and S1C). It was previously reported that MICU1 expression was required for uniporter-mediated Ca2+ uptake (Perocchi et al., 2010Perocchi F. Gohil V.M. Girgis H.S. Bao X.R. McCombs J.E. Palmer A.E. Mootha V.K. MICU1 encodes a mitochondrial EF hand protein required for Ca(2+) uptake.Nature. 2010; 467: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, MICU1 KD did not affect the ability of mitochondria to accumulate Ca2+ in response to an agonist-induced [Ca2+]i rise (Figures S1D, S1E, and S1G) nor did it affect the magnitude of a histamine-induced [Ca2+]i rise (Figure S1F) or ΔΨm (Figure S1H). MCU was identified as the pore-forming subunit of the mitochondrial uniporter (Baughman et al., 2011Baughman J.M. Perocchi F. Girgis H.S. Plovanich M. Belcher-Timme C.A. Sancak Y. Bao X.R. Strittmatter L. Goldberger O. Bogorad R.L. et al.Integrative genomics identifies MCU as an essential component of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.Nature. 2011; 476: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar; De Stefani et al., 2011De Stefani D. Raffaello A. Teardo E. Szabò I. Rizzuto R. A forty-kilodalton protein of the inner membrane is the mitochondrial calcium uniporter.Nature. 2011; 476: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1357) Google Scholar). To confirm that MICU1 and MCU KD are not functionally equivalent, we compared effects of knocking down expression of either protein in independent assays. We previously demonstrated that inhibition of basal inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R)-mediated Ca2+ release resulted in insufficient Ca2+ transfer from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to mitochondria to support optimal bioenergetics. As a consequence, cellular [AMP]:[ATP] ratio is elevated, and autophagy is activated as a prosurvival mechanism (Cárdenas et al., 2010Cárdenas C. Miller R.A. Smith I. Bui T. Molgó J. Müller M. Vais H. Cheung K.H. Yang J. Parker I. et al.Essential regulation of cell bioenergetics by constitutive InsP3 receptor Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria.Cell. 2010; 142: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). If MCU and MICU1 are each required for Ca2+m uptake, we speculated that KD of either protein would elevate [AMP]:[ATP] and induce autophagy. Nevertheless, whereas [AMP]:[ATP] was increased in MCU KD cells, it was unchanged in MICU1 KD cells (Figure S1I). Elevated autophagy was observed (Cárdenas et al., 2010Cárdenas C. Miller R.A. Smith I. Bui T. Molgó J. Müller M. Vais H. Cheung K.H. Yang J. Parker I. et al.Essential regulation of cell bioenergetics by constitutive InsP3 receptor Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria.Cell. 2010; 142: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar) in MCU KD, but it was unchanged in MICU1 KD cells (Figures S1J and S1K). Whereas the effects of MCU KD are as expected if MCU plays an essential role in Ca2+m uptake, those of MICU1 are not. These results strengthen the conclusion that MICU1 is not essential for Ca2+m uptake and support the notion that it plays a distinct role. We generated stable clones by using lentiviral short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting different regions of the MICU1 gene (Table S2 and Figure S1L). Two, shHe#B4 and shHe#B6, had 80.7% and 82.6% messenger RNA (mRNA) KD, respectively (Figure S1L). We used clone shHe#B6 for subsequent experiments. As in cells treated with MICU1 siRNA, [Ca2+]m was constitutively elevated in stable MICU1 KD cells (Figures 1A and 1B ), with elevated basal [Ca2+]m correlated with the degree of KD (Figures 1B and S1L). Also, as in siRNA-treated cells, histamine-induced Ca2+m uptake (Figures 1C and 1E) and rise of [Ca2+]i (Figure 1D) were unaltered in MICU1 KD cells. ΔΨm (Figure 1F) and [AMP]:[ATP] (Figure S1M) were not affected either, and autophagy was not activated (Figure S1N). Lack of autophagy induction in MICU1 KD cells was not due to intrinsic defects in autophagy because Xestospongin B (XeB), a specific InsP3R inhibitor, induced autophagy similarly in control (shHe#B8) and KD cells (Figure S1N). We extended these studies to human endothelial cells (EC) with MICU1 stably knocked down. Similar to HeLa cells, [Ca2+]m was constitutively elevated (Figures 1G and 1H), whereas histamine-induced Ca2+m uptake (Figures 1I and 1K) and rise of [Ca2+]i (Figure 1J) were unaffected, and ΔΨm was normal (Figure 1L). Defective Ca2+m uptake can result in enhanced agonist-induced [Ca2+]i responses due to diminished cytoplasmic buffering (Hoth et al., 2000Hoth M. Button D.C. Lewis R.S. Mitochondrial control of calcium-channel gating: a mechanism for sustained signaling and transcriptional activation in T lymphocytes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 10607-10612Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar; Simpson and Russell, 1998Simpson P.B. Russell J.T. Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and release influence metabotropic and ionotropic cytosolic Ca2+ responses in rat oligodendrocyte progenitors.J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In agreement, [Ca2+]i was elevated for a prolonged period in response to histamine in MCU KD cells, whereas a transient response was observed in MICU1 KD cells (Figure S1O). The Ca2+-dependent transcription factor NFAT was strongly activated in MCU KD cells, which is consistent with the prolonged [Ca2+]i signal, whereas only weak activation was observed in MICU1 KD cells (Figure S1P). Further, nuclear NFATC3-GFP-positive cells showed increased nuclear translocation in MCU-silenced cells compared with MICU1 KD cells (Figures S1Q and S1R). Together, these results suggest that MICU1 is not required for uniporter-dependent Ca2+ uptake, nor does it function similarly to MCU. Instead, they suggest that MICU1 may play a role in constitutively suppressing Ca2+m uptake under resting conditions. We confirmed (Perocchi et al., 2010Perocchi F. Gohil V.M. Girgis H.S. Bao X.R. McCombs J.E. Palmer A.E. Mootha V.K. MICU1 encodes a mitochondrial EF hand protein required for Ca(2+) uptake.Nature. 2010; 467: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) that MICU1 biochemically interacts with MCU (Figure S2A). MICU1 KD did not alter MCU expression (Figure S2B). We therefore considered that MICU1 may function to inhibit MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake and that the observed elevated basal [Ca2+]m in MICU1 ablated cells occurs through uncontrolled MCU-dependent Ca2+ uptake. To test this, we silenced MCU expression by >85% (Figure S2C) in control negative shRNA and MICU1 KD HeLa and ECs (Figure S2D). Histamine-induced Ca2+m uptake was effectively abrogated, demonstrating functional efficacy of MCU KD (Figures 2C and 2E ). Importantly, silencing MCU abolished elevated basal [Ca2+]m in MICU1 KD cells (Figures 2A–2E and S2H). This indicates that Ca2+m accumulation induced by loss of MICU1 is mediated by MCU-dependent Ca2+ uptake. To further verify this, we assessed Ca2+m uptake in digitonin-permeabilized stable MICU1 KD HEK293 cells (Figure S2E) bathed in intracellular-like medium (ICM) containing thapsigargin (Tg) to prevent ER Ca2+ uptake and FuraFF to monitor [Ca2+] in the medium. Following exposure of control cells to Tg, Ca2+ leak from the ER caused ICM [Ca2+] to increase progressively over ∼5 min to ∼1.8 μM (Figure 2F). Subsequent exposure to the MCU inhibitor Ru360 had little effect (Figure 2F), indicating that mitochondria had not taken up Ca2+. In contrast, ICM [Ca2+] did not increase during ER Ca2+ leakage from MICU1 KD cells (Figure 2F). Subsequent exposure to Ru360 caused a rapid rise of ICM [Ca2+] to levels observed in control cells (Figures 2F and 2G). These results indicate that Ru360-sensitive MCU-dependent Ca2+ uptake buffered Ca2+ released from the ER in the MICU1 KD cells. Further, the observation that Ca2+ efflux was active in MICU1 KD cells, evident upon addition of Ru360, indicates that MICU1 KD does not alter Ca2+m efflux (Figures 2F and S5). Importantly, this buffering occurred in MICU1 KD cells at [Ca2+] under which MCU-dependent Ca2+ uptake is normally not active. Accordingly, these results suggest that MICU1 normally acts as a brake to prevent MCU-dependent Ca2+m uptake at low [Ca2+]i.Figure 2MICU1 Knockdown-Induced Basal Ca2+m Accumulation Is Mediated by MCU-Dependent Ca2+ UptakeShow full caption(A) Representative confocal images of basal rhod-2 fluorescence in HeLa cells stably expressing Neg shRNA, MICU1 KD shRNA, and MICU1 Rescue and WT cells treated with MCU siRNA and MICU1 KD cells treated with MCU siRNA.(B) Quantification of basal rhod-2 fluorescence of cells in (A).

Mean ±SEM; ns, not different; ∗∗p < 0.01, n = 3. See also Figure S2. To test this further, we examined phosphorylation of the mitochondrial protein pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH phosphorylation by pyruvate kinase suppresses its activity, whereas dephosphorylation by Ca2+-dependent pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase (PDP) enhances it (Cárdenas et al., 2010Cárdenas C. Miller R.A. Smith I. Bui T. Molgó J. Müller M. Vais H. Cheung K.H. Yang J. Parker I. et al.Essential regulation of cell bioenergetics by constitutive InsP3 receptor Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria.Cell. 2010; 142: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar). If MICU1 normally acts to prevent MCU-mediated Ca2+ uptake under basal conditions, we speculated that PDH would be constitutively hypophosphorylated in MICU1 KD cells by enhanced Ca2+-activated PDP activity. In agreement, PDH was hypophosphorylated in MICU1KD cells (Figure S2F). As a control, XeB, which blocks ER Ca2+ release (Cárdenas et al., 2010Cárdenas C. Miller R.A. Smith I. Bui T. Molgó J. Müller M. Vais H. Cheung K.H. Yang J. Parker I. et al.Essential regulation of cell bioenergetics by constitutive InsP3 receptor Ca2+ transfer to mitochondria.Cell. 2010; 142: 270-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar), increased PDH phosphorylation in the MICU1 KD cells to levels comparable to those in the control cells (Figure S2G). Our results suggest that MICU1 may regulate the apparent Ca2+ affinity or threshold of MCU-dependent Ca2+ uptake. To examine this in more detail, we used the permeabilized cell protocol and simultaneously monitored the rate of Ca2+m uptake and ΔΨm in response to boluses of Ca2+ added to ICM. Cells (∼6 million) were permeabilized in ICM containing Tg. After 450 s, a single bolus of Ca2+ was added, and the Fura FF (Figure 3A) and JC-1 (Figure 3B) signals were monitored for 300 s before an uncoupler (CCCP) was added to depolarize the IMM and to release accumulated Ca2+ (Figures 3A and 3F). Ca2+ uptake in these conditions, monitored as a decrease in ICM [Ca2+], is completely dependent on MCU (Figure 3G). In response to a 0.5 μM Ca2+ bolus, ICM [Ca2+] rapidly rose to a stable plateau in control cells, indicating lack of Ca2+m uptake at this [Ca2+], as expected. In contrast, ICM [Ca2+] decreased to nearly the prepulse level in MICU1 KD cells (Figure 3A). Subsequent CCCP addition released significantly more Ca2+ from MICU1 KD mitochondria, indicating that the decrease in ICM [Ca2+] following the initial pulse was due to Ca2+m uptake (Figure 3F, see inset). Similarly, in response to a 1 μM Ca2+ pulse, Ca2+ uptake in control cells was absent, whereas uptake in MICU1 KD cells was substantial (Figure 3A). The difference in Ca2+m uptake between control and MICU1 KD cells was not due to a greater driving force for Ca2+ uptake in MICU1 KD cells because ΔΨm both before and during the Ca2+ pulses were similar in control and KD cells (Figure 3B), and MICU1 KD mitochondria have higher basal [Ca2+]m (Figures 1B, 1H, 2B, and 2D). In addition, it cannot be accounted for by different expression levels of MCU (Figure S2B). In response to a 2 μM Ca2+ pulse, control mitochondria buffered the [Ca2+] but to a level (the set point; Nicholls, 2005Nicholls D.G. Mitochondria and calcium signaling.Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) that was significantly higher than that achieved by MICU1 KD mitochondria (Figure 3A). At higher concentrations (5–50 μM), both control and MICU1 KD cells exhibited robust Ca2+m uptake (Figure 3A) with similar transient ΔΨm depolarizations at 20 and 50 μM pulses (Figure 3B). Reconstitution of MICU1 (Figures S2E and S2G) in MICU1 KD HeLa cells prevented elevated basal [Ca2+]m and reverted Ca2+m uptake (Figures 2A–2E). Similarly, rescue of MICU1 in permeabilized HEK293 cells prevented elevated basal [Ca2+]m and reverted Ca2+m uptake in response to low [Ca2+] bolus additions (1–5 μM) to control levels (Figures S3A–S3D).Figure S3Reconstitution of MICU1 Reverses Mitochondrial Ca2+ Uptake Phenotypes in MICU1 Knockdown Cells, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Rescue of mitochondrial [Ca2+] set-point and Ca2+ uptake in response to low [Ca2+] pulses in permeabilized MICU1 KD HEK293 cells (red) by shRNA insensitive MICU1 cDNA re-expression (blue).

https://openalex.org/W2043831708,"Data on absolute molecule numbers will empower the modeling, understanding, and comparison of cellular functions and biological systems. We quantified transcriptomes and proteomes in fission yeast during cellular proliferation and quiescence. This rich resource provides the first comprehensive reference for all RNA and most protein concentrations in a eukaryote under two key physiological conditions. The integrated data set supports quantitative biology and affords unique insights into cell regulation. Although mRNAs are typically expressed in a narrow range above 1 copy/cell, most long, noncoding RNAs, except for a distinct subset, are tightly repressed below 1 copy/cell. Cell-cycle-regulated transcription tunes mRNA numbers to phase-specific requirements but can also bring about more switch-like expression. Proteins greatly exceed mRNAs in abundance and dynamic range, and concentrations are regulated to functional demands. Upon transition to quiescence, the proteome changes substantially, but, in stark contrast to mRNAs, proteins do not uniformly decrease but scale with cell volume."
https://openalex.org/W2028791709,"Dopamine is synonymous with reward and motivation in mammals. However, only recently has dopamine been linked to motivated behaviour and rewarding reinforcement in fruitflies. Instead, octopamine has historically been considered to be the signal for reward in insects. Here we show, using temporal control of neural function in Drosophila, that only short-term appetitive memory is reinforced by octopamine. Moreover, octopamine-dependent memory formation requires signalling through dopamine neurons. Part of the octopamine signal requires the α-adrenergic-like OAMB receptor in an identified subset of mushroom-body-targeted dopamine neurons. Octopamine triggers an increase in intracellular calcium in these dopamine neurons, and their direct activation can substitute for sugar to form appetitive memory, even in flies lacking octopamine. Analysis of the β-adrenergic-like OCTβ2R receptor reveals that octopamine-dependent reinforcement also requires an interaction with dopamine neurons that control appetitive motivation. These data indicate that sweet taste engages a distributed octopamine signal that reinforces memory through discrete subsets of mushroom-body-targeted dopamine neurons. In addition, they reconcile previous findings with octopamine and dopamine and suggest that reinforcement systems in flies are more similar to mammals than previously thought."
https://openalex.org/W2081313987,"Human antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) can neutralize a broad range of viral isolates in vitro and protect non-human primates against infection. Previous work showed that antibodies exert selective pressure on the virus but escape variants emerge within a short period of time. However, these experiments were performed before the recent discovery of more potent anti-HIV-1 antibodies and their improvement by structure-based design. Here we re-examine passive antibody transfer as a therapeutic modality in HIV-1-infected humanized mice. Although HIV-1 can escape from antibody monotherapy, combinations of broadly neutralizing antibodies can effectively control HIV-1 infection and suppress viral load to levels below detection. Moreover, in contrast to antiretroviral therapy, the longer half-life of antibodies led to control of viraemia for an average of 60 days after cessation of therapy. Thus, combinations of potent monoclonal antibodies can effectively control HIV-1 replication in humanized mice, and should be re-examined as a therapeutic modality in HIV-1-infected individuals."

We defined, using Bayes theorem, credible sets of SNPs that were 95% likely, based on posterior probability, to contain the causal disease-associated SNPs. In 3 of the 14 regions, TCF7L2 (T2D), CTLA4 (Graves' disease) and CDKN2A-CDKN2B (T2D), much of the posterior probability rested on a single SNP, and, in 4 other regions (CDKN2A-CDKN2B (CAD) and CDKAL1, FTO and HHEX (T2D)), the 95% sets were small, thereby excluding most SNPs as potentially causal. Very few SNPs in our credible sets had annotated functions, illustrating the limitations in understanding the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to common diseases. Our results also show the value of more detailed mapping to target sequences for functional studies."

Grid cells — neurons located in the entorhinal cortex that exhibit place-modulated activity — provide the brain with the spatial information and spatial memory needed during navigation. The cells have been extensively studied in rodents, but there have been no single-unit analyses of grid cells in primates. Here, Elizabeth Buffalo and colleagues record entorhinal cortex neural activity in monkeys performing a visual memory task involving images on a computer monitor. The resulting data directly demonstrate the existence of grid cells in primates, and show that these cells are active during visuospatial exploration, even when the animal is not moving and is simply searching with its eyes. Place-modulated activity among neurons in the hippocampal formation presents a means to organize contextual information in the service of memory formation and recall1,2. One particular spatial representation, that of grid cells, has been observed in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of rats and bats3,4,5, but has yet to be described in single units in primates. Here we examined spatial representations in the EC of head-fixed monkeys performing a free-viewing visual memory task6,7. Individual neurons were identified in the primate EC that emitted action potentials when the monkey fixated multiple discrete locations in the visual field in each of many sequentially presented complex images. These firing fields possessed spatial periodicity similar to a triangular tiling with a corresponding well-defined hexagonal structure in the spatial autocorrelation. Further, these neurons showed theta-band oscillatory activity and changing spatial scale as a function of distance from the rhinal sulcus, which is consistent with previous findings in rodents4,8,9,10. These spatial representations may provide a framework to anchor the encoding of stimulus content in a complex visual scene. Together, our results provide a direct demonstration of grid cells in the primate and suggest that EC neurons encode space during visual exploration, even without locomotion."

Endometrial cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, causing ∼74,000 deaths annually1. Serous endometrial cancers are a clinically aggressive subtype with a poorly defined genetic etiology2,3,4. We used whole-exome sequencing to comprehensively search for somatic mutations within ∼22,000 protein-encoding genes in 13 primary serous endometrial tumors. We subsequently resequenced 18 genes, which were mutated in more than 1 tumor and/or were components of an enriched functional grouping, from 40 additional serous tumors. We identified high frequencies of somatic mutations in CHD4 (17%), EP300 (8%), ARID1A (6%), TSPYL2 (6%), FBXW7 (29%), SPOP (8%), MAP3K4 (6%) and ABCC9 (6%).

https://openalex.org/W1963825171,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with severe human diseases and are maternally inherited through the egg’s cytoplasm. Here we investigated the feasibility of mtDNA replacement in human oocytes by spindle transfer (ST; also called spindle–chromosomal complex transfer). Of 106 human oocytes donated for research, 65 were subjected to reciprocal ST and 33 served as controls. Fertilization rate in ST oocytes (73%) was similar to controls (75%); however, a significant portion of ST zygotes (52%) showed abnormal fertilization as determined by an irregular number of pronuclei. Among normally fertilized ST zygotes, blastocyst development (62%) and embryonic stem cell isolation (38%) rates were comparable to controls. All embryonic stem cell lines derived from ST zygotes had normal euploid karyotypes and contained exclusively donor mtDNA. The mtDNA can be efficiently replaced in human oocytes. Although some ST oocytes displayed abnormal fertilization, remaining embryos were capable of developing to blastocysts and producing embryonic stem cells similar to controls. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA cause a wide range of disorders in humans, with a high prevalence; here it is shown that the nucleus of an affected woman’s egg could be inserted into healthy donor egg cytoplasm by spindle transfer, allowing the birth of healthy offspring. Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cause various human diseases. Their inheritance is through the mother because all zygotic mitochondria derive from the oocyte. Shoukhrat Mitalipov and colleagues previously reported proof-of-concept replacement of mtDNA through chromosome spindle transfer in macaque oocytes, and here they extend the technology to human oocytes. They also report on the health of a 3-year-old macaque born from an mtDNA-replaced oocyte. This work suggests that replacement therapy for mtDNA disorders could become a reality. Dieter Egli and colleagues took a different approach: they performed nuclear genome transfer between unfertilized human oocytes from two different donors. The resulting oocytes retained the ability to develop to the blastocyst stage and to produce embryonic stem cell lines with normal karyotypes. This technique has the potential to prevent the transmission of mtDNA mutations without causing manipulation-induced karyotypic abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2119656037,"Retroviral overexpression of reprogramming factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) generates induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, the integration of foreign DNA could induce genomic dysregulation. Cell-permeant proteins (CPPs) could overcome this limitation. To date, this approach has proved exceedingly inefficient. We discovered a striking difference in the pattern of gene expression induced by viral versus CPP-based delivery of the reprogramming factors, suggesting that a signaling pathway required for efficient nuclear reprogramming was activated by the retroviral, but not CPP approach. In gain- and loss-of-function studies, we find that the toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) pathway enables efficient induction of pluripotency by viral or mmRNA approaches. Stimulation of TLR3 causes rapid and global changes in the expression of epigenetic modifiers to enhance chromatin remodeling and nuclear reprogramming. Activation of inflammatory pathways are required for efficient nuclear reprogramming in the induction of pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2030594866,"Human chromosome ends are capped by shelterin, a protein complex that protects the natural ends from being recognized as sites of DNA damage and also regulates the telomere-replicating enzyme, telomerase. Shelterin includes the heterodimeric POT1-TPP1 protein, which binds the telomeric single-stranded DNA tail. TPP1 has been implicated both in recruiting telomerase to telomeres and in stimulating telomerase processivity (the addition of multiple DNA repeats after a single primer-binding event). Determining the mechanisms of these activities has been difficult, especially because genetic perturbations also tend to affect the essential chromosome end-protection function of TPP1 (refs 15-17). Here we identify separation-of-function mutants of human TPP1 that retain full telomere-capping function in vitro and in vivo, yet are defective in binding human telomerase. The seven separation-of-function mutations map to a patch of amino acids on the surface of TPP1, the TEL patch, that both recruits telomerase to telomeres and promotes high-processivity DNA synthesis, indicating that these two activities are manifestations of the same molecular interaction. Given that the interaction between telomerase and TPP1 is required for telomerase function in vivo, the TEL patch of TPP1 provides a new target for anticancer drug development."
https://openalex.org/W2136678404,"In the course of primary infection with herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), children with inborn errors of toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) immunity are prone to HSV-1 encephalitis (HSE). We tested the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of HSE involves non-haematopoietic CNS-resident cells. We derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from the dermal fibroblasts of TLR3- and UNC-93B-deficient patients and from controls. These iPSCs were differentiated into highly purified populations of neural stem cells (NSCs), neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The induction of interferon-β (IFN-β) and/or IFN-λ1 in response to stimulation by the dsRNA analogue polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) was dependent on TLR3 and UNC-93B in all cells tested. However, the induction of IFN-β and IFN-λ1 in response to HSV-1 infection was impaired selectively in UNC-93B-deficient neurons and oligodendrocytes. These cells were also much more susceptible to HSV-1 infection than control cells, whereas UNC-93B-deficient NSCs and astrocytes were not. TLR3-deficient neurons were also found to be susceptible to HSV-1 infection. The rescue of UNC-93B- and TLR3-deficient cells with the corresponding wild-type allele showed that the genetic defect was the cause of the poly(I:C) and HSV-1 phenotypes. The viral infection phenotype was rescued further by treatment with exogenous IFN-α or IFN-β ( IFN-α/β) but not IFN-λ1. Thus, impaired TLR3- and UNC-93B-dependent IFN-α/β intrinsic immunity to HSV-1 in the CNS, in neurons and oligodendrocytes in particular, may underlie the pathogenesis of HSE in children with TLR3-pathway deficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W2068904459,"Dendritic spines operate as high-impedance input structures that amplify local synaptic depolarization to enhance electrical interaction among coactive inputs. Neuronal excitation in the mammalian brain relies on small dendritic compartments called 'spines', whose size, shape and molecular composition vary with experience. Here, Jeff Magee and colleagues show that spine-neck resistance is large enough (at about 500 MΩ) to amplify 1.5- to 45-fold the spine-head depolarization associated with unitary synaptic inputs. The authors thus confirm that spines enhance neurons' computational and memory capabilities, by promoting nonlinear signal processing in dendrites. Dendritic spines are the nearly ubiquitous site of excitatory synaptic input onto neurons1,2 and as such are critically positioned to influence diverse aspects of neuronal signalling. Decades of theoretical studies have proposed that spines may function as highly effective and modifiable chemical and electrical compartments that regulate synaptic efficacy, integration and plasticity3,4,5,6,7,8. Experimental studies have confirmed activity-dependent structural dynamics and biochemical compartmentalization by spines9,10,11,12. However, there is a longstanding debate over the influence of spines on the electrical aspects of synaptic transmission and dendritic operation3,4,5,6,7,8,13,14,15,16,17,18. Here we measure the amplitude ratio of spine head to parent dendrite voltage across a range of dendritic compartments and calculate the associated spine neck resistance (Rneck) for spines at apical trunk dendrites in rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that Rneck is large enough (∼500 MΩ) to amplify substantially the spine head depolarization associated with a unitary synaptic input by ∼1.5- to ∼45-fold, depending on parent dendritic impedance. A morphologically realistic compartmental model capable of reproducing the observed spatial profile of the amplitude ratio indicates that spines provide a consistently high-impedance input structure throughout the dendritic arborization. Finally, we demonstrate that the amplification produced by spines encourages electrical interaction among coactive inputs through an Rneck-dependent increase in spine head voltage-gated conductance activation. We conclude that the electrical properties of spines promote nonlinear dendritic processing and associated forms of plasticity and storage, thus fundamentally enhancing the computational capabilities of neurons19,20,21."
https://openalex.org/W1964722626,"It is well established that exposure of mammalian cells to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) suppresses mitochondrial function by inhibiting cytochrome-c oxidase (CcOX; complex IV). However, recent experimental data show that administration of H2S to mammalian cells can serve as an electron donor and inorganic source of energy. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of endogenously produced H2S in the regulation of mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in isolated liver mitochondria and in the cultured murine hepatoma cell line Hepa1c1c7. Low concentrations of H2S (0.1–1 μM) elicited a significant increase in mitochondrial function, while higher concentrations of H2S (3–30 μM) were inhibitory. The positive bioenergetic effect of H2S required a basal activity of the Krebs cycle and was most pronounced at intermediate concentrations of succinate. 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP), the substrate of the mitochondrial enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) stimulated mitochondrial H2S production and enhanced mitochondrial electron transport and cellular bioenergetics at low concentrations (10–100 nM), while at higher concentrations, it inhibited cellular bioenergetics. SiRNA silencing of 3-MST reduced basal bioenergetic parameters and prevented the stimulating effect of 3-MP on mitochondrial bioenergetics. Silencing of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) also reduced basal and 3-MP-stimulated bioenergetic parameters. We conclude that an endogenous intramitochondrial H2S-producing pathway, governed by 3-MST, complements and balances the bioenergetic role of Krebs cycle-derived electron donors. This pathway may serve a physiological role in the maintenance of mitochondrial electron transport and cellular bioenergetics.—Módis, K., Coletta, C., Erdélyi, K., Papapetropoulos, A., Szabo, C.

https://openalex.org/W2158073956,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease primarily affecting motor neurons. Mutations in the gene encoding TDP-43 cause some forms of the disease, and cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates accumulate in degenerating neurons of most individuals with ALS. Thus, strategies aimed at targeting the toxicity of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates may be effective. Here, we report results from two genome-wide loss-of-function TDP-43 toxicity suppressor screens in yeast. The strongest suppressor of TDP-43 toxicity was deletion of DBR1, which encodes an RNA lariat debranching enzyme. We show that, in the absence of Dbr1 enzymatic activity, intronic lariats accumulate in the cytoplasm and likely act as decoys to sequester TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with essential cellular RNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Knockdown of Dbr1 in a human neuronal cell line or in primary rat neurons is also sufficient to rescue TDP-43 toxicity. Our findings provide insight into TDP-43-mediated cytotoxicity and suggest that decreasing Dbr1 activity could be a potential therapeutic approach for ALS."

Furthermore, Lin28a/b promote malignant transformation, and their expression is associated with advanced stages of many types of tumors, including hepatocarcinoma, nephroblastoma, ovarian carcinoma, and germ cell tumors (Thornton and Gregory, 2012Thornton J.E.

Selective blockade of microRNA processing by Lin28.Science. 2008; 320: 97-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, LIN28 binds to the primary transcript of let-7 (pri-let-7) and prevents its processing by RNase III DROSHA (Newman et al., 2008Newman M.A. Thomson J.M. Hammond S.M.

In the cytoplasm, it interacts with the precursor form of let-7 (pre-let-7) and interferes with pre-let-7 processing (Heo et al., 2008Heo I. Joo C. Cho J. Ha M. Han J. Kim V.N.

LIN28 recruits TUTase 4 (ZCCHC11) to induce oligo-uridylation of pre-let-7, which effectively blocks DICER processing and facilitates degradation of the RNA (Hagan et al., 2009Hagan J.P.

TUT4 in concert with Lin28 suppresses microRNA biogenesis through pre-microRNA uridylation.Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Although LIN28B is localized mainly in the nucleolus and interferes with nuclear processing, LIN28A is found mostly in the cytoplasmic compartment and acts in concert with TUTase 4 (Piskounova et al., 2011Piskounova E. Polytarchou C. Thornton J.E. LaPierre R.J. Pothoulakis C. Hagan J.P. Iliopoulos D. Gregory R.I.

LIN28 homologs commonly have two types of RNA binding domains: a cold shock domain and a cluster of two CCHC-type zinc finger motifs. We previously showed by biochemical analyses that the “GGAG” sequences in the terminal loop of let-7 precursors serve as the binding site for the zinc finger domains that are critical for let-7 regulation (Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. TUT4 in concert with Lin28 suppresses microRNA biogenesis through pre-microRNA uridylation.Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). More recent structural studies revealed the molecular basis of the interaction between LIN28 and the terminal loop of pre-let-7 (Loughlin et al., 2012Loughlin F.E. Gebert L.F. Towbin H. Brunschweiger A. Hall J. Allain F.H. Structural basis of pre-let-7 miRNA recognition by the zinc knuckles of pluripotency factor Lin28.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Molecular basis for interaction of let-7 microRNAs with Lin28.Cell. 2011; 147: 1080-1091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Although let-7 is certainly a key target of LIN28, multiple lines of evidence support additional functions of LIN28. First, during retinoic-acid-induced neurogliogenesis, Lin28a overexpression altered the expression of several transcription factors involved in early embryonic cell fate decision before any increase in let-7 level was detected (Balzer et al., 2010Balzer E. Heine C. Jiang Q. Lee V.M. Moss E.G. LIN28 alters cell fate succession and acts independently of the let-7 microRNA during neurogliogenesis in vitro.Development. 2010; 137: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Second, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance were observed in muscle-specific Lin28a knockout mice without significant changes in the let-7 level (Zhu et al., 2011Zhu H. Shyh-Chang N. Segrè A.V. Shinoda G. Shah S.P. Einhorn W.S. Takeuchi A. Engreitz J.M. Hagan J.P. Kharas M.G. et al.DIAGRAM ConsortiumMAGIC InvestigatorsThe Lin28/let-7 axis regulates glucose metabolism.Cell. 2011; 147: 81-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Third, LIN28A interacts with mRNAs and cosediments with polysome in sucrose gradient centrifugation (Balzer and Moss, 2007Balzer E. Moss E.G. Localization of the developmental timing regulator Lin28 to mRNP complexes, P-bodies and stress granules.RNA Biol. 2007; 4: 16-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Consistently, several studies reported that LIN28A can bind to and enhance translation of certain mRNAs such as Igf2 in differentiating myoblasts and Oct4 in ESCs (Polesskaya et al., 2007Polesskaya A. Cuvellier S. Naguibneva I. Duquet A. Moss E.G. Harel-Bellan A.

Lin28 modulates cell growth and associates with a subset of cell cycle regulator mRNAs in mouse embryonic stem cells.RNA. 2009; 15: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In order to obtain a genome-wide view of LIN28A’s function, we identified LIN28A-interacting RNAs by using a technique that combines UV crosslinking, immunoprecipitation, and high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq, also known as HITS-CLIP) (Chi et al., 2009Chi S.W.

Wang X. et al.HITS-CLIP yields genome-wide insights into brain alternative RNA processing.Nature. 2008; 456: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). This technique takes advantage of UV irradiation of live cells, which introduces covalent bonds between the bases and amino acids (such as Cys, Lys, Phe, Trp, and Tyr) in close proximity (∼1 Å), capturing the physiological state of RNA-protein interaction (Licatalosi and Darnell, 2010Licatalosi D.D.

Cross-linking of mRNA to proteins by irradiation of intact cells with ultraviolet light.Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 112: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Because of the crosslinking, one can use harsh immunoprecipitation conditions to eliminate artificial RNA-protein interactions that commonly occur in cell lysates (Dreyfuss et al., 1984Dreyfuss G.

In addition, sequencing of the coimmunopurified RNA fragments provides a global view of the interacting transcriptome and allows mapping of exact binding sites on target RNAs (Kishore et al., 2011Kishore S. Jaskiewicz L. Burger L. Hausser J. Khorshid M. Zavolan M. A quantitative analysis of CLIP methods for identifying binding sites of RNA-binding proteins.Nat.

Mapping in vivo protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution from HITS-CLIP data.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In this study, we find that LIN28A targets not only the let-7 precursors but also a large number of mRNAs. Analyses of the binding sites reveal general features of LIN28A binding motif. We further discover by ribosome footprinting that LIN28A acts as a suppressor of translation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathway. To purify the LIN28A-RNA complexes, we irradiated mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) with UV light, lysed the cells, treated the lysates with RNase A, and immunoprecipitated the complexes by using antibodies against LIN28A. RNA fragments from the immunoprecipitates were ligated to linkers, amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced with Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (Figures 1A and S1A available online). To ensure specific isolation of LIN28A-interacting RNAs, we obtained three different libraries by using three anti-LIN28A antibodies, one rabbit polyclonal antibody (Abcam) and two mouse monoclonal antibodies raised in-house (35L33G and 2J3). The amounts of RNA recovered from immunoprecipitates were significantly reduced when LIN28A was depleted, indicating that the antibodies specifically precipitated the LIN28A protein and its target RNAs (Figures 1B and S1B). About 32 million reads were obtained from each CLIP cDNA library and 32% of them were confidently mapped to unique positions in the mouse genome (Table S1). To assess the reproducibility of the experiments, the correlation of transcript-level enrichments was evaluated across the three CLIP-seq libraries. The Pearson coefficients between any two of the three libraries were at least 0.93 (Figure S1C), indicating that most of the LIN28A CLIP tags had originated from the common pool of LIN28A-interacting RNAs. Because the let-7 family miRNAs are the most thoroughly studied targets of LIN28A, they serve as important positive controls for our experiment. As expected, we detected CLIP tags from let-7 precursors in the sequence alignment (Figures 1C and 1D for Mirlet7g; see also Figures S2A and S2B for Mirlet7d and Mirlet7f-1, respectively). Because it remains unclear whether the let-7 family is the only miRNA target of LIN28A in mESCs, we analyzed our CLIP-seq library to find other LIN28A-interacting miRNAs. Because there is yet no reliable method to globally quantify the amounts of miRNA precursors, we had to use mature miRNA signals from microarrays for normalization. Despite the technical limitation, the let-7 family comprises the most enriched group in the CLIP-seq (Figure 1E). Although a few miRNA precursors such as pre-miR-677 and pre-miR-708 showed comparable enrichments, their mature miRNA levels did not change significantly upon Lin28a knockdown (Figure 1E and Table S2). Thus, this analysis indicates that, at least in mESCs, the let-7 family is likely to be the only functional miRNA target of LIN28A. Our previous biochemical study showed that the GGAG motif in the terminal loop of the let-7 precursor serves as the binding center for the CCHC zinc finger domains and is required for specific recognition by LIN28A (Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. TUT4 in concert with Lin28 suppresses microRNA biogenesis through pre-microRNA uridylation.Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Almost all let-7g CLIP tags contain the GGAG sequence, indicating that our CLIP libraries faithfully reflect physiological interactions between LIN28A and let-7g precursor. Interestingly, we noticed frequent sequence alterations at the GGAG motif in our CLIP tags (Figures 1C and 1D). Particularly, the first guanosine of the motif is often substituted with other nucleotides. Similar substitution pattern was observed with other let-7 precursors as well (Figures S2A and S2B). Such alteration on a specific site is likely to be an outcome of UV crosslinking to LIN28A because a small piece of crosslinked peptide would remain even after proteinase treatment and interfere with the progression of reverse transcriptase as previously reported (Granneman et al., 2009Granneman S. Kudla G. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. Identification of protein binding sites on U3 snoRNA and pre-rRNA by UV cross-linking and high-throughput analysis of cDNAs.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Mapping in vivo protein-RNA interactions at single-nucleotide resolution from HITS-CLIP data.Nat. Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Our libraries contain a large number of tags mapped to non-miRNA transcripts, suggesting that LIN28A may interact with other types of RNAs in addition to let-7 precursors. To precisely map the binding sites in such transcripts, we took advantage of the mutations. Substitution and deletion errors are significantly more prevalent in our CLIP-seq libraries (∼1.5% for substitution and ∼0.5% for deletion) than in the RNA-seq library (∼0.25% for substitution and ∼0.05% for deletion), whereas insertion errors occur at comparable rates in the two different types of libraries (Figure S2C). Like in the let-7 precursors, most substitutions and deletions in CLIP tags are found on G, whereas error frequencies on A, C, or U are similar to those in RNA-seq library (Figure S2D). The base substitution in CLIP-seq data is a useful feature that allows mapping of protein binding sites at single-nucleotide resolution. We searched for LIN28A-binding sites on a transcriptome-wide level by using Shannon’s information entropy, which quantifies the randomness of nucleotide composition at a given position. It reduces false positives derived from single-nucleotide polymorphism or paralogous genes, which generally cause only one or two types of substitutions rather than all three possible substitutions (i.e., G to A, C, or T). The mutation rate quantified by Shannon’s entropy correlates with the enrichment level of the given site in CLIP-seq, albeit modestly (Figure S3A), which further supports our notion that the mutated sites are derived from genuine LIN28A binding sites. Altogether, we identified 516,259 putative binding sites with the confidence level of 0.1% false discovery rate (FDR) (Figure S3B and Table S3A), which means that a confident LIN28A binding site occurs at every 21.7 guanosines. On average, 38.5 sites were detected per mRNA. This unexpectedly large number of binding sites suggests that LIN28A binding is not restricted to a few sites on a small group of RNAs. Rather, LIN28A interacts with a large proportion of transcriptome. To better understand LIN28A-RNA interactions, we further analyzed patterns around the potential LIN28A binding sites (Figures 2A and S3C). The frequently mutated G is preceded by two bases with strong preference for A or U and is followed by three bases favoring G or A. We also observed clear depletion of C across the hexamer. The resulting consensus sequence in the WebLogo is “AAGNGG” (Figure 2A). Unexpectedly, this consensus is different from the most frequently observed hexamer, “AAGGAG” (Figure 2B and Table S3B). We reasoned that the consensus may actually be a mixture of multiple distinct motifs. Indeed, similarity network of the LIN28A-bound hexamers revealed three distinct clusters, AAGNNG, AAGNG(N), and (N)UGUG(N) (Figure 2C). The “AAGNNG”-type hexamers account for the majority of LIN28A binding sites. This is consistent with the recent structural study that showed that the two zinc finger motifs of LIN28A recognizes “AGNNG” (Loughlin et al., 2012Loughlin F.E. Gebert L.F. Towbin H. Brunschweiger A. Hall J. Allain F.H. Structural basis of pre-let-7 miRNA recognition by the zinc knuckles of pluripotency factor Lin28.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 84-89Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The “AAGNG”-type pentamers also appear, albeit with lower frequency. Note that the least prevalent “UGUG” motif has not been reported before and may reflect a different mode of LIN28A binding. We further validated these three motifs by carrying out electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with recombinant LIN28A protein and chemically synthesized RNA segments (Figure S4). Three representative RNAs containing the AAGGAG, AAGAG, and UGUG elements interacted with LIN28A, with UGUG being the weakest binder. Mutations to the G residue (that is frequently substituted in CLIP-seq) strongly reduced the affinity toward LIN28A, confirming that the identified motifs provide genuine binding sites for LIN28A.Figure S4Validation of Identified LIN28A-Recognition Motifs, Related to Figure 2Show full captionElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was carried out with 5′-end 32P-labeled synthetic pre-let-7a-1, the loop region of pre-let-7a-1, and three snippets from LIN28A binding sites detected from LIN28A CLIP-seq and their mutants.

The complex formation between the protein and RNAs were done with 0, 18.5, 55.6, 167 or 500 nM of recombinant LIN28A protein, respectively. Because, in the case of pre-let-7, the GGAG motif is invariably located in the terminal loop near the stem (Heo et al., 2009Heo I. Joo C. Kim Y.K. Ha M. Yoon M.J. Cho J. Yeom K.H. Han J. Kim V.N. TUT4 in concert with Lin28 suppresses microRNA biogenesis through pre-microRNA uridylation.Cell. 2009; 138: 696-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar), and our EMSA data show that the stem of pre-let-7 enhances the binding of LIN28A (Figure S4); we examined the secondary structure around the binding motif. Interestingly, the sequences upstream of the hexamers are often complementary to the other side of the hexamer (Figure 2D). The bases surrounding AAGNNG-type binding sites have clear propensity to form Watson-Crick (WC) pairs compared to randomly permuted sequences (Figure 2E, left). Moderate but significant enrichment was observed between bases that are up to seven nucleotides from the LIN28A-interacting hexamers, indicating that the stem surrounding the hexamer is around 7 bp in length. Similarly, the AAGNG pentamer is located in the terminal loop of a stem-loop structure with a slightly shorter stem (∼5 bp) (Figure 2E, right). It is noted that some binding sites are in single-stranded RNA regions of more complex structures such as branched hairpins. The preference of LIN28A for a hairpin structure is further supported by folding energy analysis (Figure S3D). Stronger structures (lower free energy) tend to appear more frequently in the CLIP libraries than those with weak structure (Figure S3D). The hairpin structure may help present the LIN28A-recognition element in a more accessible manner. Together, our analyses indicate that LIN28A preferably binds to a “AAG(N)NG” motif located in the terminal loop of a hairpin with a stem of 5–7 bp. When we looked at all AAGGAG instances within a stem-loop structure in abundantly expressed mRNAs, almost half of the instances (41.7% with a cutoff of free energy of −6 kcal/mol) were experimentally detected in our CLIP-seq (Figure S3E). Other frequently observed motifs were also detected at similar rates when combined with low free energy cutoff (Figure S3E). This suggests that the motifs identified from our analyses may indeed be sufficient for LIN28A binding as long as the binding site is accessible to LIN28A in the cell. Next, we analyzed the types of RNAs that interact with LIN28A. Among the RNAs in the LIN28A CLIP-seq libraries, mRNAs constituted the most enriched class—over 42% of the tags were mapped to mRNAs, whereas miRNA loci made up only 0.07% of the sequenced reads (0.05% came from let-7 loci) (Figure 3A and Table S4). The second most abundant class was ribosomal RNA, which occupied 17% of the CLIP tags. However, considering the overwhelming amount of rRNAs in cells (∼80% of total RNA), our result indicates that mRNAs are the major interactors of LIN28A. Within mRNAs, intronic regions are strongly depleted in CLIP tags (Figure 3B), indicating that LIN28A interacts with mature mRNAs after splicing is completed. We also analyzed the average density of the CLIP tags around start and stop codons (Figure 3C). The metagene analysis showed significant depletion of LIN28A binding in the 5′ UTR compared to the coding sequences (CDS) and the 3′ UTR. To understand the functional significance of mRNA-LIN28A interaction, we first considered a possibility that LIN28A may regulate the abundance of its targets. However, when we measured mRNA levels by RNA-seq after Lin28a knockdown, we could not find a significant correlation between CLIP tag enrichment (representing LIN28A binding; Figure 4A, x axis) and the changes in mRNA levels (Figure 4A, y axis). Therefore, LIN28A is unlikely to be involved in the stability control of its target mRNAs. We next asked whether LIN28A regulates translation. LIN28A has previously been shown to be associated with polysomes in mouse teratocarcinoma P19 (Balzer and Moss, 2007Balzer E. Moss E.G. Localization of the developmental timing"
https://openalex.org/W2021519886,"Neural regulation of energy expenditure is incompletely understood. By genetically disrupting GABAergic transmission in a cell-specific fashion, and by combining this with selective pharmacogenetic activation and optogenetic mapping techniques, we have uncovered an arcuate-based circuit that selectively drives energy expenditure. Specifically, mice lacking synaptic GABA release from RIP-Cre neurons have reduced energy expenditure, become obese and are extremely sensitive to high-fat diet-induced obesity, the latter due to defective diet-induced thermogenesis. Leptin's ability to stimulate thermogenesis, but not to reduce feeding, is markedly attenuated. Acute, selective activation of arcuate GABAergic RIP-Cre neurons, which monosynaptically innervate PVH neurons projecting to the NTS, rapidly stimulates brown fat and increases energy expenditure but does not affect feeding. Importantly, this response is dependent upon GABA release from RIP-Cre neurons. Thus, GABAergic RIP-Cre neurons in the arcuate selectively drive energy expenditure, contribute to leptin's stimulatory effect on thermogenesis, and protect against diet-induced obesity."

Chemical probes to perturb DAGLs are needed to characterize endocannabinoid function in biological processes. Here we report a series of 1,2,3-triazole urea inhibitors, along with paired negative-control and activity-based probes, for the functional analysis of DAGLβ in living systems.

Using these agents and Daglb−/− mice, we show that DAGLβ inactivation lowers 2-AG, as well as arachidonic acid and eicosanoids, in mouse peritoneal macrophages in a manner that is distinct and complementary to disruption of cytosolic phospholipase-A2. We observed a corresponding reduction in lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-α release. These findings indicate that DAGLβ is a key metabolic hub within a lipid network that regulates proinflammatory responses in macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2063855257,"Novel pathogenic infectious retroviruses, generated by recombination between replication-defective endogenous retroviruses in the absence of a functional antibody response, are identified; these recombinant retroviruses establish infection of mouse colonies and ultimately cause cancer. Retroviruses can establish germline infections and become part of the host genome, but most of the resulting endogenous retroviruses, or ERVs, become inactive or transcriptionally silenced. This paper presents evidence for the emergence of novel pathogenic infectious retroviruses generated by recombination between replication-defective ERVs in the absence of a functional antibody response. The viruses are shown to be transmissible in mouse colonies, and to give rise to a range of pathologies, including cancer. Resurrection of ERVs in the context of antibody deficiency is less pronounced in the absence of a complex microbiota. This work reveals a previously unappreciated role for immunity in the control of ERVs. The mammalian host has developed a long-standing symbiotic relationship with a considerable number of microbial species. These include the microbiota on environmental surfaces, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts1, and also endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), comprising a substantial fraction of the mammalian genome2,3. The long-term consequences for the host of interactions with these microbial species can range from mutualism to parasitism and are not always completely understood. The potential effect of one microbial symbiont on another is even less clear. Here we study the control of ERVs in the commonly used C57BL/6 (B6) mouse strain, which lacks endogenous murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs) able to replicate in murine cells. We demonstrate the spontaneous emergence of fully infectious ecotropic4 MLV in B6 mice with a range of distinct immune deficiencies affecting antibody production. These recombinant retroviruses establish infection of immunodeficient mouse colonies, and ultimately result in retrovirus-induced lymphomas. Notably, ERV activation in immunodeficient mice is prevented in husbandry conditions associated with reduced or absent intestinal microbiota. Our results shed light onto a previously unappreciated role for immunity in the control of ERVs and provide a potential mechanistic link between immune activation by microbial triggers and a range of pathologies associated with ERVs, including cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1997763763,"Salmonella spp. are gram-negative flagellated bacteria that can cause food- and waterborne gastroenteritis and typhoid fever in humans. We now report that flagellin from Salmonella spp. is recognized in mouse intestine by Toll-like receptor 11 (TLR11). Absence of TLR11 renders mice more susceptible to infection by S. Typhimurium, with increased dissemination of the bacteria and enhanced lethality. Unlike S. Typhimurium, S. Typhi, a human obligatory pathogen that causes typhoid fever, is normally unable to infect mice. TLR11 is expressed in mice, but not in humans, and remarkably, we find that tlr11(-/-) mice are efficiently infected with orally administered S. Typhi. We also find that tlr11(-/-) mice can be immunized against S. Typhi. Therefore, tlr11(-/-) mice represent a small-animal model for the study of the immune response to S. Typhi and for the development of vaccines against this important human pathogen."

Several genome-wide association studies have yielded numerous common variants conferring risk of prostate cancer. Here, we analyzed 32.5 million variants discovered by whole-genome sequencing 1,795 Icelanders. We identified a new low-frequency variant at 8q24 associated with prostate cancer in European populations, rs188140481[A] (odds ratio (OR) = 2.90; Pcombined = 6.2 × 10−34), with an average risk allele frequency in controls of 0.54%. This variant is only very weakly correlated (r2 ≤ 0.06) with previously reported risk variants at 8q24, and its association remains significant after adjustment for all known risk-associated variants. Carriers of rs188140481[A] were diagnosed with prostate cancer 1.26 years younger than non-carriers (P = 0.0059). We also report results for a previously described HOXB13 variant (rs138213197[T]), confirming it as a prostate cancer risk variant in populations from across Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2022634792,"The GTPase dynamin polymerizes into a helical coat that constricts membrane necks of endocytic pits to promote their fission. However, the dynamin mechanism is still debated because constriction is necessary but not sufficient for fission. Here, we show that fission occurs at the interface between the dynamin coat and the uncoated membrane. At this location, the considerable change in membrane curvature increases the local membrane elastic energy, reducing the energy barrier for fission. Fission kinetics depends on tension, bending rigidity, and the dynamin constriction torque. Indeed, we experimentally find that the fission rate depends on membrane tension in vitro and during endocytosis in vivo. By estimating the energy barrier from the increased elastic energy at the edge of dynamin and measuring the dynamin torque, we show that the mechanical energy spent on dynamin constriction can reduce the energy barrier for fission sufficiently to promote spontaneous fission.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI4ZTdjZDdmMDg4YzYxNTY4OGRjNzEyN2M0ZDU3MGYzNiIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4NDEzMzY3fQ.slw4VhbZCBYDrfyxug-New25SETJP3HxBQ6VK9a2XB2jKfA46l1QVl0BvJruSHxhMPQIThA9Y89DKXpznopBS3o12nf69aLmiz7zwGSQqz8PkixrT34yrSLRh-2a3GLOkEe-YQAZj1pbIlpK657VVyqWhCu8-OaRP1TbkXrS09wx4tpXMUB23SFR6mFs7X-fNFwaHt2WQVtNQSeTaYmWpAdxyY6jNr3ekq2EgpqvPlv1RNVrK3Q5mOzr6dMaZAnBTTnPBjn0Q3N7XrStwjQ4ZDttGB4SU2ls0GSdodGfWqJBBLuXuycvaJPuyx4XMhdNzYHj22cNq84m1fUQpHsDNg(mp4, (47.44 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2113821359,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs; also known as ADP-ribosyl transferase D proteins) modify acceptor proteins with ADP-ribose modifications of varying length (reviewed in refs , , ). PARPs regulate key stress response pathways, including DNA damage repair and the cytoplasmic stress response. Here, we show that PARPs also regulate the unfolded protein response (UPR) of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Human PARP16 (also known as ARTD15) is a tail-anchored ER transmembrane protein required for activation of the functionally related ER stress sensors PERK and IRE1α during the UPR. The third identified ER stress sensor, ATF6, is not regulated by PARP16. As is the case for other PARPs that function during stress, the enzymatic activity of PARP16 is upregulated during ER stress when it ADP-ribosylates itself, PERK and IRE1α. ADP-ribosylation by PARP16 is sufficient for activating PERK and IRE1α in the absence of ER stress, and is required for PERK and IRE1α activation during the UPR. Modification of PERK and IRE1α by PARP16 increases their kinase activities and the endonuclease activity of IRE1α. Interestingly, the carboxy-terminal luminal tail of PARP16 is required for PARP16 function during ER stress, suggesting that it transduces stress signals to the cytoplasmic PARP catalytic domain."
https://openalex.org/W1978842800,"A number of key regulators of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell identity, including the transcription factor Nanog, show strong expression fluctuations at the single-cell level. The molecular basis for these fluctuations is unknown. Here we used a genetic complementation strategy to investigate expression changes during transient periods of Nanog downregulation. Employing an integrated approach that includes high-throughput single-cell transcriptional profiling and mathematical modelling, we found that early molecular changes subsequent to Nanog loss are stochastic and reversible. However, analysis also revealed that Nanog loss severely compromises the self-sustaining feedback structure of the ES cell regulatory network. Consequently, these nascent changes soon become consolidated to committed fate decisions in the prolonged absence of Nanog. Consistent with this, we found that exogenous regulation of Nanog-dependent feedback control mechanisms produced a more homogeneous ES cell population. Taken together our results indicate that Nanog-dependent feedback loops have a role in controlling both ES cell fate decisions and population variability."
https://openalex.org/W1989140691,"Single-molecule analysis of RecA filament assembly on its in vivo substrate, SSB-coated single-stranded DNA, reveals that a dimer of RecA is required for nucleation, and is followed by bidirectional growth of the filament through monomer addition; the recombination mediator RecOR accelerates nucleation and growth, and the addition of RecF further stimulates nucleation. An early step in the repair of DNA lesions or stalled replication forks by homologous recombination involves the pairing of homologous DNAs by the strand-exchange protein RecA. RecA from the bacterium Escherichia coli nucleates binding on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) as a small cluster of subunits, after which it extends to form a protein–DNA filament. Until now, it has not been possible to visualize its assembly on ssDNA because of the difficulty of creating ssDNA that can be readily used in single-molecule experiments. But now Stephen Kowalczykowski and colleagues have characterized the nucleation and extension of this filament by single-molecule microscopy. The data indicate why 'mediator' proteins might be necessary to facilitate loading and growth, predictions that are confirmed by adding the bacterial RecFOR complex to the reaction. Escherichia coli RecA is the defining member of a ubiquitous class of DNA strand-exchange proteins that are essential for homologous recombination, a pathway that maintains genomic integrity by repairing broken DNA1. To function, filaments of RecA must nucleate and grow on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in direct competition with ssDNA-binding protein (SSB), which rapidly binds and continuously sequesters ssDNA, kinetically blocking RecA assembly2,3. This dynamic self-assembly on a DNA lattice, in competition with another protein, is unique for the RecA family compared to other filament-forming proteins such as actin and tubulin. The complexity of this process has hindered our understanding of RecA filament assembly because ensemble measurements cannot reliably distinguish between the nucleation and growth phases, despite extensive and diverse attempts2,3,4,5. Previous single-molecule assays have measured the nucleation and growth of RecA—and its eukaryotic homologue RAD51—on naked double-stranded DNA and ssDNA6,7,8,9,10,11,12; however, the template for RecA self-assembly in vivo is SSB-coated ssDNA3. Using single-molecule microscopy, here we directly visualize RecA filament assembly on single molecules of SSB-coated ssDNA, simultaneously measuring nucleation and growth. We establish that a dimer of RecA is required for nucleation, followed by growth of the filament through monomer addition, consistent with the finding that nucleation, but not growth, is modulated by nucleotide and magnesium ion cofactors. Filament growth is bidirectional, albeit faster in the 5′→3′ direction. Both nucleation and growth are repressed at physiological conditions, highlighting the essential role of recombination mediators in potentiating assembly in vivo. We define a two-step kinetic mechanism in which RecA nucleates on transiently exposed ssDNA during SSB sliding and/or partial dissociation (DNA unwrapping) and then the RecA filament grows. We further demonstrate that the recombination mediator protein pair, RecOR (RecO and RecR), accelerates both RecA nucleation and filament growth, and that the introduction of RecF further stimulates RecA nucleation."

Escherichia coli ycfD is a growth-regulating 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase catalyzing arginyl hydroxylation of the ribosomal protein Rpl16. Human ycfD homologs, Myc-induced nuclear antigen (MINA53) and NO66, are also linked to growth and catalyze histidyl hydroxylation of Rpl27a and Rpl8, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1991456846,"Most cystic fibrosis is caused by the deletion of a single amino acid (F508) from CFTR and the resulting misfolding and destabilization of the protein. Compounds identified by high-throughput screening to improve ΔF508 CFTR maturation have already entered clinical trials, and it is important to understand their mechanisms of action to further improve their efficacy. Here, we showed that several of these compounds, including the investigational drug VX-809, caused a much greater increase (5- to 10-fold) in maturation at 27 than at 37°C (<2-fold), and the mature product remained short-lived (T(1/2)∼4.5 h) and thermally unstable, even though its overall conformational state was similar to wild type, as judged by resistance to proteolysis and interdomain cross-linking. Consistent with its inability to restore thermodynamic stability, VX-809 stimulated maturation 2-5-fold beyond that caused by several different stabilizing modifications of NBD1 and the NBD1/CL4 interface. The compound also promoted maturation of several disease-associated processing mutants on the CL4 side of this interface. Although these effects may reflect an interaction of VX-809 with this interface, an interpretation supported by computational docking, it also rescued maturation of mutants in other cytoplasmic loops, either by allosteric effects or via additional sites of action. In addition to revealing the capabilities and some of the limitations of this important investigational drug, these findings clearly demonstrate that ΔF508 CFTR can be completely assembled and evade cellular quality control systems, while remaining thermodynamically unstable.

Despite this effort, accumulating data have shown that all identified loci combined can only explain a small fraction of the variation in the population. This has been speculated to be partly due to environmental factors and their interaction with various genes influencing the traits. Therefore, uncovering such gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions will aid in understanding the mechanisms underlying the observed variation in the population. In an effort to elucidate such interactions, we focused on inflammation and sought to determine to what extent environmental factors that trigger immunological responses interact with naturally occurring variation to determine the phenotypic outcomes. Inflammation is the innate immune response to harmful stimuli such as pathogens, injury, and tissue malfunction. Acute inflammation is associated with the response to infection and tissue injury and is often triggered by recognition of bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In contrast, chronic inflammation is thought to be the underlying cause of many complex diseases, including autoimmune disease (Kanter et al., 2006Kanter J.L. Narayana S. Ho P.P. Catz I. Warren K.G. Sobel R.A. Steinman L. Robinson W.H. Lipid microarrays identify key mediators of autoimmune brain inflammation.Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), Alzheimer’s disease (Rojo et al., 2006Rojo L. Sjöberg M.K. Hernández P. Zambrano C. Maccioni R.B. Roles of cholesterol and lipids in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease.J. Biomed. Biotechnol. 2006; 2006: 73976Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and atherosclerosis (Berliner et al., 2009Berliner J.A. Leitinger N. Tsimikas S. The role of oxidized phospholipids in atherosclerosis.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S207-S212PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that oxidized phospholipids, such as oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (OxPAPC), are potent environmental stimuli that can trigger the initial recruitment of macrophages and contribute to both initiation and progression of chronic inflammation (Berliner et al., 2009Berliner J.A. Leitinger N. Tsimikas S. The role of oxidized phospholipids in atherosclerosis.J. Lipid Res. 2009; 50: S207-S212PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Genetic variation in naturally occurring populations can have dramatic effects on how individuals respond to environmental stimuli such as LPS and OxPAPC. Studies in model organisms have revealed thousands of GxE interactions responsible for phenotypic differences among genetically diverse individuals (Smith and Kruglyak, 2008Smith E.N. Kruglyak L. Gene-environment interaction in yeast gene expression.PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e83Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Wurfel et al. demonstrated in humans that some individuals show high sensitivity to LPS, whereas others exhibit low sensitivity (Wurfel et al., 2005Wurfel M.M. Park W.Y. Radella F. Ruzinski J. Sandstrom A. Strout J. Bumgarner R.E. Martin T.R. Identification of high and low responders to lipopolysaccharide in normal subjects: an unbiased approach to identify modulators of innate immunity.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), suggesting that GxE interactions play a role in the extent of inflammatory responses. Similarly, chronic inflammatory conditions such atherosclerosis are influenced by both genetic and environmental variation, and multiple studies suggest that GxE interactions are an important component of the disease etiology (Romanoski et al., 2010Romanoski C.E. Lee S. Kim M.J. Ingram-Drake L. Plaisier C.L. Yordanova R. Tilford C. Guan B. He A. Gargalovic P.S. et al.Systems genetics analysis of gene-by-environment interactions in human cells.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2010; 86: 399-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to understand macrophage inflammatory responses and how these are influenced by genetics in a panel of genetically diverse mouse inbred strains called the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP). We obtained primary macrophages from each of the strains and exposed them to inflammatory stimuli. We then profiled the transcriptome and used genome-wide association to reveal genetic loci and GxE interactions in the macrophage response to inflammatory stimuli. All our results are publicly available through our database website http://systems.genetics.ucla.edu/data. Here we will describe our results and demonstrate how the analyses and data we generated can be exploited to further our understanding of cellular processes involved in macrophage inflammation. To better understand inflammatory responses in macrophages, we obtained primary macrophages from 92 mouse inbred strains of the HMDP. We exposed the cells to control media, LPS, or OxPAPC and used microarrays to measure genome-wide messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels. To determine reproducibility, we also examined expression levels from seven strains in the control condition and five strains in the LPS condition at different times, using different mice of the same strain to examine biological reproducibility. We used hierarchical clustering of data for all genes in the microarray and found that samples of the same strain clustered together independent of the experiment date, suggesting that genome-wide expression levels were highly reproducible for both experimental and biological replicates (Figures S1A and S1B available online). As an example, the variation in the response to LPS of Ccl2 (MCP-1) is shown in Figure S1C. If the variation in gene expression between samples of the same strain was comparable to variation among different strains, this would lead to false-positive results due to random fluctuations in gene-expression levels. To examine this possibility, we compared the distribution of the variance in gene expression among different strains (inter-strain variance) to the variance in samples from the same strain (intra-strain variance). We found that the inter-strain variance was 2.2-fold larger than the intra-strain variance in strain BXH20/KccJ (p = 1.26 × 10−226, Figure S1D), with similar results in additional strains, where the inter-strain variance was larger than the intra-strain variance by 2-fold in BXA12/PgnJ (p = 0), 2.5-fold larger in BXD33/TyJ (p = 9.99 × 10−270), 2.4-fold larger in BXD36/TyJ (p = 8.49 × 10−309), and 2.3-fold larger in LG/J (p = 0). We carried out expression array profiling in macrophages from 92 strains out of the 100 strains originally included in the HMDP. To ensure that we did not introduce a bias due to possible differences in cell viability in response to an inflammatory stimulus, we examined viability using calcein AM, which produces an intense fluorescence in live but not dead cells (Figure S2). We found no significant differences in viability after LPS treatment (p = 0.76) between cells from strains included (93.6%) and strains not included in this study (94.9%). In a genetically diverse population such as our panel of strains, GxE interactions can be observed when a strain(s) responds to a given environmental stimulus (e.g., LPS), whereas another strain(s) of different genetic background does not. We found GxE interactions in 2,607 (20.1%) genes in LPS-treated cells, 512 (3.9%) genes in OxPAPC-treated cells, and 2,786 (21.5%) genes that showed a GxE interaction in at least one of the conditions. Although treatment influenced expression levels in a larger number of genes for LPS than for OxPAPC treatment, a large proportion of the genes differentially expressed show GxE interactions in both LPS (2607/2802, 93%) and OxPAPC (512/593, 86%) treatments. The total number of genes regulated and genes regulated over 2-fold is shown in Table S1. Figure 1 shows representative examples of environmental, genetic, and GxE effects. Expression levels of Heme Oxygenase-1 (Hmox1) are shown in Figure 1A for cells in control and OxPAPC-treated cells in different mouse strains and in Figure 1B for cells in control and LPS-treated cells. Hmox1 expression is strongly regulated by environmental inflammatory stimuli in response to OxPAPC (p < 1 × 10−16), but not in response to LPS. In contrast, expression of N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate lyase (Npl) is strongly influenced by genetic effects (Figure 1C, p < 1 × 10−16), but not by environmental effects in response to LPS (p = 0.37). The expression levels of Interferon-activated gene 205 (Ifi205) are influenced by environmental effects (Figure 1D, p < 5.17 × 10−6) and genetic effects (p < 1 × 10−16) and show a GxE interaction (p < 1 x 10−16). We used DAVID gene ontology (GO) to identify pathways and cellular processes enriched in genes regulated by inflammatory stimuli. Consistent with previous work, we found that phosphoproteins (p = 2.5 x 10−23), Toll-like receptor signaling (p = 5.1 x 10−9), and NOD-like receptor signaling (p = 4.1 x 10−6) were highly enriched in response to LPS, whereas regulation of kinase activity (p = 4.7 x 10−5), cytokine production (p = 3.7 x 10−5), and SH2 domain (p = 1.8 x 10−4), which recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues, were enriched in response to OxPAPC. Genes that were regulated by OxPAPC and not by LPS were enriched in glutathione metabolism (p = 1.5 x 10−5) and response to oxidative stress (p = 9.5 x 10−3), consistent with the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays a major in role in chronic inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis. In contrast, genes regulated by LPS and not by OxPAPC were enriched in phosphoproteins (p = 1.2 x 10−20) and the Toll-like receptor pathway (p = 1.4 x 10−8). The complete list of genes, fold-induction, ANOVA p values, and FDRs can be found in the online database, as can plots similar to those shown in Figure 1 to examine the response to LPS or OxPAPC for all genes represented in the array. To identify genetic loci responsible for inflammatory responses and GxE interactions, we used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the mouse genome to perform association mapping of genome-wide expression levels. For each gene, we associated differences in gene expression to genetic differences using efficient mixed model association (EMMA). We and others have previously shown that EMMA effectively reduces false-positive associations due to population structure among the mouse inbred strains (Bennett et al., 2010Bennett B.J. Farber C.R. Orozco L. Kang H.M. Ghazalpour A. Siemers N. Neubauer M. Neuhaus I. Yordanova R.

Efficient control of population structure in model organism association mapping.Genetics. 2008; 178: 1709-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar), thus allowing us to identify genomic loci that regulate the mRNA expression levels of any given gene represented in the microarray. These loci are commonly referred to as expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTL. We observed dramatic differences in the eQTL identified in control, LPS-treated, and OxPAPC-treated macrophages (Figure 2 and Table S2). We found both local or cis-eQTL, where expression levels of a gene were regulated by genetic variation at or near that same gene, as well as distant or trans-eQTL, where expression levels of a given gene were controlled by variation at a different locus, likely representing regulatory relationships between the genes. Most of the loci we identified in trans belonged to the LPS-treated macrophages (18,082), followed by 11,658 loci identified in control-treated cells, and 9,344 loci identified in OxPAPC-treated cells, at the 5% FDR level. We also found a large number of cis associations: 5,217 in the control, 4,587 in the LPS, and 4,747 in the OxPAPC conditions. Treatment-specific associations represent an interaction between genetics and the environment, where specific differences in gene expression are only observed in the context of an external stimulus. To specifically examine genetic loci influenced by GxE interactions, we mapped the fold difference between LPS-treated and control gene-expression levels, or the fold difference between OxPAPC-treated and control expression levels. We found 4,805 gxeQTL in LPS and 81 gxeQTL in OxPAPC conditions in trans, as well as 1,394 cis-gxeQTL in response to LPS and 219 cis-gxeQTL in response to OxPAPC (Table S2 and Figure S3). For example, Ifi205 is a gene that shows a gxeQTL in cis (Figure 1D), whereas Abca1 shows a gxeQTL in trans (Figures 5A and 5B) in the LPS condition. Genes with gxeQTL in LPS but not in OxPAPC were highly enriched for acetylation (p < 8.2 × 10−25), phosphoprotein (p < 3.2 × 10−18), and mitochondrial proteins (p < 4.4 × 10−15) using GO. We did not find significant GO enrichments in the OxPAPC gxeQTL. Type I and type II errors in association studies can be due to the influence of confounders such as population structure and batch effects. These can result in an inflation (too many false positives) or deflation (too many false negatives) in the association results. We used EMMA to control for spurious associations due to population structure, and to verify that there was no inflation, we computed the inflation factor lambda. Lambda values over 1 indicate inflation, lambda values under 1 indicate deflation, and lambda of 1 indicates neither. We computed the inflation factor in our association results and observed no evidence of inflation, with lambda values ranging from 0.9 to 1 (Table S2). Association results for all genes and all conditions can be found on our online database. Previous studies on the genetics of gene expression have suggested the existence of eQTL hot spots, where a polymorphism(s) at a locus is responsible for changes in gene expression in tens or hundreds of genes (Ghazalpour et al., 2008Ghazalpour A.

These can be seen as vertical bands in the plots of genome-wide association of gene expression (Figure 2), where hundreds of transcripts across the genome were all associated with a SNP(s) in a locus. To find eQTL hot spots, we divided the genome into 2 Mb size bins and counted the number of trans-eQTL genes mapping to each bin. We observed striking differences in hot spots from cells exposed to the different stimuli. We found 54 significant hot spots in control-treated cells, 47 hot spots in LPS, 39 hot spots in OxPAPC, 17 hot spots for LPS gxeQTL, and no hot spots in OxPAPC gxeQTL (Figures 3 and S4). The majority (145/157) of the hot spots regulated less than 1% of all eQTL in each condition, and only 3 hot spots, identified in response to LPS, regulated more than 5% of eQTL. A complete list of eQTL hot spot genome positions, their significance, and the number of genes regulated by each hot spot can found in Table S3 and in our online database. We identified several common hot spots in the different conditions. Although we found a significant overlap in the transcripts mapping to hot spots that overlap in different conditions, the majority of the transcripts mapping to each hot spot were specific to the treatment condition. The number of hot spots that overlap in the different conditions can be found in Table S4 and in our online database.Figure S4No Significant eQTL Hot Spots in OxPAPC gxeQTL, Related to Figure 3Show full captionWe counted the number of genes with significant eQTL in 2 Mb bins across the mouse genome in OxPAPC gxeQTL.

The number of genes mapping to each bin is shown on the y axis and the genomic position of the bin is on the x axis. The horizontal dashed line represents the significance threshold such that a 2 Mb bin is considered a hot spot if the number of genes mapping to the bin is above the threshold. The finding of an eQTL hot spot suggests the presence of a regulator(s). We found a total of eight unique hot spots with profound changes in gene expression across the genome, affecting more than 1% of all eQTL. Three of these mapped to previously known regulators of inflammatory responses, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, Tnf, in the hot spot at 34–36 Mb on chromosome 17 for LPS-treated cells and in the LPS-response gxeQTL. We also found a cluster of Serpin genes adjacent to a hot spot at 110–112 Mb on chromosome 1 in the LPS and LPS-response conditions. Serpinb2, which plays a role in adaptive immunity (Schroder et al., 2010Schroder W.A. Le T.T.T. Major L. Street S. Gardner J. Lambley E. Markey K. MacDonald K.P. Fish R.J. Thomas R. Suhrbier A. A physiological function of inflammation-associated SerpinB2 is regulation of adaptive immunity.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 2663-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), is a candidate causal regulator for this locus. Finally, Interleukin 1a (Il1a) and Interleukin 1b (Il1b) are candidate genes in an OxPAPC-specific hot spot at 128–130 Mb on chromosome 2. These observations suggest that the eQTL hot spots we identified are biologically meaningful, and hence that the hot spots in loci not previously implicated in inflammation will likely reveal novel regulators of inflammation. To identify novel regulators of inflammatory responses, we experimentally validated one of the hot spots in LPS-treated cells. The locus is in mouse chromosome 8 at approximately 119 Mb and controls a large number of eQTL, 6% of eQTL in LPS and 13.5% of LPS gxeQTL. There are 12 candidate genes in the locus based on the linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure. To narrow down the list of candidate genes for experimental validation, we selected genes that showed a difference in expression among the strains and genes with documented coding nonsynonymous SNPs and excluded genes whose expression was undetectable by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in primary macrophages. These criteria narrowed down our list to six genes: 2310061C15Rik, 4933407C03Rik, Atmin, Gcsh, 1700030J22Rik, and Gan. Among these, 2310061C15Rik had a strong cis-eQTL in LPS-treated cells (p = 1.9 × 10−9). For experimental validation, we used small interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down expression levels in each of the six candidate genes in primary mouse macrophages treated with LPS. We were successful in obtaining approximately 50% knockdown in four of the candidates, 2310061C15Rik, 4933407C03Rik, Atmin, and Gcsh. However, despite repeated attempts, we were unable to obtain consistent knockdown of either 1700030J22Rik or Gan, possibly due to the low level of expression in the case of the 1700030J22Rik gene. To assess the effect of knockdown on trans-eQTL genes predicted to be regulated by the chromosome 8 locus, we used qPCR to measure expression of 19 trans-eQTL genes. In these initial experiments, we saw that 8 of the 19 genes tested (42%) were validated reproducibly, and their expression was affected by knockdown of either 2310061C15Rik in 6 of the 8 genes or Gcsh in 2 of the 8 genes. We did not observe reproducible differences in the 19 trans-eQTL genes after knockdown of the other candidate genes. To more comprehensibly validate the chromosome 8 hot spot, we used microarrays to examine global gene expression. For this, we again used siRNA to knock down the two candidate genes, 2310061C15Rik and Gcsh, because qPCR showed that they have the highest effect on target genes. We used microarrays to profile the transcriptome after knockdown and determined how many of the genes that mapped to the chromosome 8 hot spot locus as eQTL were affected by the knockdown (Figure 4). Knockdown of 2310061C15Rik or Gcsh had significant effects on 173 and 128 genes, respectively (Figure 4A and Table S5). The number of genes affected in each knockdown experiment was significantly higher than expected by chance based on random samplings in LPS-treated cells (p = 1.11 < 1 × 10−16 for 2310061C15Rik and p < 1 × 10−16 for Gcsh). Similar results were observed for the LPS-response condition (Table S5). To assess the functional significance of genes validated in each knockdown experiment, we looked at the GO enrichment terms for each list. The GO enrichments for genes influenced by siRNA knockdown of 2310061C15Rik were immune response (p = 9.3 × 10−11), regulation of T cell activation (p = 7.0 × 10−5), cytokines (p = 2.0 × 10−4), and Toll-like receptor signaling (p = 4.0 × 10−4) in the LPS condition and included inflammatory cytokines and LPS primary-response genes such as lll1b, Csf1, Il6, Ccl2 (MCP-1), and Serpine1 (Figure 4B). In contrast, the genes influenced by siRNA knockdown of Gcsh were enriched in GTPase activity (p = 3.3 × 10−3) and were not enriched in immune response or Toll-like receptor signaling (p = 0.62). Our validation results confirm that the chromosome 8 eQTL hot spot represents biologically meaningful regulatory relationships between candidate genes and trans-eQTL mapping genes. However, we also observed that more than one gene in the locus was responsible for regulation of the trans-eQTL. Finally, our results indicate that 2310061C15Rik is a novel regulator of inflammatory responses underlying the chromosome 8 eQTL hot spot. One of the goals of systems genetics is to understand the behavior of the system as a whole by identifying all the elements present in the system and understanding the relationships among them. The eQTL identified in our study provide a suitable resource to understand the gene expression regulatory circuits present in macrophages when they are exposed to inflammatory stimuli such as LPS and OxPAPC. This information can also be used to understand the biological networks underlying traits with an inflammatory component. Toward this end, we have developed an online database, and below we describe how it facilitates discovery of new and/or pre-existing relationships among genes and clinical traits. Here are some of the types of data that can be obtained for any gene of interest represented in the array, as an example for Abca1: (1) a user can query and download in tabular or graphical format our results for genetic, environmental, and GxE effects (Figure 5A). The tabular format includes ANOVA p values, FDRs, the average fold-change in response to a treatment, and the number of strains that show a fold difference above two for each of the conditions. (2) The user can obtain in tabular format the results for gene-gene expression correlations between the gene of interest and all other genes. (3) A user can obtain in tabular or graphical format all eQTL association results for the gene of interest, in any of the conditions (Figure 5B). The tabular format also conveys detailed information such as the p value for the association, specific SNP name and coordinates, and links to the UCSC genome browser at that locus. (4) One can also obtain gene-expression profiles, correlations, and eQTL results from additional tissues (liver and bone) previously profiled in the HMDP and compare expression in macrophage control, LPS, and OxPAPC to adipose, aorta, heart, and liver for a gene of interest (Figure 5C). Similarly, one can obtain results for correlations, eQTL, or clinical QTL from additional genetic studies in mouse intercrosses and in human endothelial cells exposed to OxPAPC. All of these can be used to compare and contrast results between these data sets and the macrophage data set presented here. Our database allows us to screen for novel genes that regulate a gene of interest using trans-eQTL for the gene. Each trans-eQTL is hypothesized to harbor at least one gene (e.g., geneA) that is responsible for modulating the expression of a gene of interest (e.g., geneB). However, because the locus may carry more than one gene (e.g., several genes can be geneA), the limiting step in identifying such interactions is to select the appropriate candidate regulator. To do this, we can use various parameters such as the following: linkage disequilibrium to define the physical boundaries of the locus; the median expression of the genes in HMDP strains to exclude genes that are very lowly expressed in the cell; presence of cis-eQTL to select genes that vary in expression in HMDP strains as a result of genetic variation in or near the gene; coding nonsynonymous SNPs to select genes that have structural variation; and previously documented relationships in the published literature. As an example, we used trans-eQTL and the various criteria described above to establish putative regulatory relationships for Abca1, a gene involved in reverse cholesterol transport (Figure 6). Expression of Abca1 maps to four different loci in LPS-treated cells (Figure 5B). A locus on chromosome 17 contains Tnf, a gene known to regulate Abca1 (Edgel et al., 2010Edgel K.A. Leboeuf R.C. Oram J.F. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha and lymphotoxin-alpha increase macrophage ABCA1 by gene expression and protein stabilization via different receptors.Atherosclerosis. 2010; 209: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The locus on chromosome 4 contains Toll-like receptor 4, Tlr4. Although previous studies have suggested a connection between Toll-like receptor signaling and cholesterol efflux pathways (Zhu et al., 2010Zhu X. Owen J.S. Wilson M.D. Li H. Griffiths G.L. Thomas M.J. Hiltbold E.M. Fessler M.B. Parks J.S. Macrophage ABCA1 reduces MyD88-dependent Toll-like receptor trafficking to lipid rafts by reduction of lipid raft cholesterol.J. Lipid Res. 2010; 51: 3196-3206Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), our observed trans-eQTL suggests that Abca1 itself is regulated by Tlr4. Another locus on chromosome 17 is roughly 1 Mb away from Lnpep, a gene involved in cholesterol metabolism, which suggests regulation of Abca1 by Lnpep. Based on a fourth trans-eQTL, 2310061C15Rik is also hypothesized to regulate Abca1, as there is a cis-eQTL for the candidate gene 2310061C15Rik. Similarly, extending the network connections to known published associations and novel associations found through the trans-eQTL in our data set created a link between reverse cholesterol transport and adipogenesis via Pparg and Adipor2 (Chinetti et al., 2004Chinetti G.

Through crystallographic snapshots and mechanism-inspired chemical probes, we define how human OGT recognizes the sugar donor and acceptor peptide and uses a new catalytic mechanism of glycosyl transfer, involving the sugar donor α-phosphate as the catalytic base as well as an essential lysine.

https://openalex.org/W2052472267,"Obesity is often marked by chronic, low-grade inflammation, which is believed to contribute to metabolic disturbances associated with this condition. Chih-Hao Lee and colleagues show that injection of a known immunomodulatory glycan, one found in mother's milk and in S. mansoni egg extract, results in improved metabolic function of the adipose tissue and liver in a mouse dietary-mediated obesity model. Parasitic worms express host-like glycans to attenuate the immune response of human hosts. The therapeutic potential of this immunomodulatory mechanism in controlling the metabolic dysfunction that is associated with chronic inflammation remains unexplored. We demonstrate here that administration of lacto-N-fucopentaose III (LNFPIII), a LewisX-containing immunomodulatory glycan found in human milk and on parasitic helminths, improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in diet-induced obese mice. This effect is mediated partly through increased interleukin-10 (Il-10) production by LNFPIII-activated macrophages and dendritic cells, which reduces white adipose tissue inflammation and sensitizes the insulin response of adipocytes. Concurrently, LNFPIII treatment upregulates nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group H, member 4 (Fxr-α, also known as Nr1h4) to suppress lipogenesis in the liver, conferring protection against hepatosteatosis. At the signaling level, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)-activator protein 1 (Ap1) pathway seems to mediate the effects of LNFPIII on both inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Our results suggest that LNFPIII may provide new therapeutic approaches to treat metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2029212519,"In this study, the authors show that Hox5 genes are essential for the organization, survival and axonal branching of motor neurons required for breathing. Unexpectedly, this requirement for Hox5 activity persists to later developmental stages. Respiration in mammals relies on the rhythmic firing of neurons in the phrenic motor column (PMC), a motor neuron group that provides the sole source of diaphragm innervation. Despite their essential role in breathing, the specific determinants of PMC identity and patterns of connectivity are largely unknown. We show that two Hox genes, Hoxa5 and Hoxc5, control diverse aspects of PMC development including their clustering, intramuscular branching, and survival. In mice lacking Hox5 genes in motor neurons, axons extend to the diaphragm, but fail to arborize, leading to respiratory failure. Genetic rescue of cell death fails to restore columnar organization and branching patterns, indicating these defects are independent of neuronal loss. Unexpectedly, late Hox5 removal preserves columnar organization but depletes PMC number and branches, demonstrating a continuous requirement for Hox function in motor neurons. These findings indicate that Hox5 genes orchestrate PMC development through deployment of temporally distinct wiring programs."

https://openalex.org/W1996855351,"The interaction between IgE and its receptor FcεRI underlies many allergic responses; here the structure and mechanism of a newly engineered DARPin inhibitor is presented, revealing that it not only blocks the receptor–ligand interaction but also dissociates already-formed complexes. The interaction between immunoglobulin E (IgE) and its receptor Fc?RI underlies many allergic responses. In this manuscript, Jardetzky and colleagues present the structure of a newly engineered ankyrin-repeat protein inhibitor (DARPin), and show that it not only blocks the receptor–ligand interaction but also dissociates previously formed complexes. The inhibitor is shown to act through a facilitated dissociation mechanism. The results demonstrate that IgE–Fc conformational fluctuations are dynamic and can be targeted by allosteric modulators to block the allergic response. IgE antibodies bind the high-affinity IgE Fc receptor (FcεRI), found primarily on mast cells and basophils, and trigger inflammatory cascades of the allergic response1,2. Inhibitors of IgE–FcεRI binding have been identified and an anti-IgE therapeutic antibody (omalizumab) is used to treat severe allergic asthma3,4. However, preformed IgE–FcεRI complexes that prime cells before allergen exposure dissociate extremely slowly5 and cannot be disrupted by strictly competitive inhibitors. IgE-Fc conformational flexibility indicated that inhibition could be mediated by allosteric or other non-classical mechanisms6,7,8. Here we demonstrate that an engineered protein inhibitor, DARPin E2_79 (refs 9, 10, 11), acts through a non-classical inhibition mechanism, not only blocking IgE–FcεRI interactions, but actively stimulating the dissociation of preformed ligand–receptor complexes. The structure of the E2_79–IgE-Fc3-4 complex predicts the presence of two non-equivalent E2_79 sites in the asymmetric IgE–FcεRI complex, with site 1 distant from the receptor and site 2 exhibiting partial steric overlap. Although the structure is indicative of an allosteric inhibition mechanism, mutational studies and quantitative kinetic modelling indicate that E2_79 acts through a facilitated dissociation mechanism at site 2 alone. These results demonstrate that high-affinity IgE–FcεRI complexes can be actively dissociated to block the allergic response and suggest that protein–protein complexes may be more generally amenable to active disruption by macromolecular inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2073812060,"Whereas proliferating cells enter M phase shortly after DNA replication, the first M phase of meiosis is preceded by an extended prophase in which homologous chromosomes undergo recombination. Exit from prophase I is controlled by the recombination checkpoint (RC), which, in yeast, represses the meiosis-specific transcription factor Ndt80 required for the expression of B-type cyclins and other M phase regulators. We show that an extended prophase I additionally requires the suppression of latent, mitotic cell-cycle controls by the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and its meiosis-specific activator Ama1, which trigger the degradation of M phase regulators and Ndd1, a subunit of a mitotic transcription factor. ama1Δ mutants exit from prophase I prematurely and independently of the RC, which results in recombination defects and chromosome missegregation. Thus, control of prophase I by meiotic mechanisms depends on the suppression of the alternative, mitotic mechanisms by a meiosis-specific form of the APC/C."
https://openalex.org/W2091287100,"Embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency requires bivalent epigenetic modifications of key developmental genes regulated by various transcription factors and chromatin-modifying enzymes. How these factors coordinate with one another to maintain the bivalent chromatin state so that ESCs can undergo rapid self-renewal while retaining pluripotency is poorly understood. We report that Utf1, a target of Oct4 and Sox2, is a bivalent chromatin component that buffers poised states of bivalent genes. By limiting PRC2 loading and histone 3 lysine-27 trimethylation, Utf1 sets proper activation thresholds for bivalent genes. It also promotes nuclear tagging of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) transcribed from insufficiently silenced bivalent genes for cytoplasmic degradation through mRNA decapping. These opposing functions of Utf1 promote coordinated differentiation. The mRNA degradation function also ensures rapid cell proliferation by blocking the Myc-Arf feedback control. Thus, Utf1 couples the core pluripotency factors with Myc and PRC2 networks to promote the pluripotency and proliferation of ESCs."

In the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 system, different cell types express varying numbers of alternative second receptor chains (γc or IL-13Rα1), forming functionally distinct type I or type II complexes. We manipulated the affinity and specificity of second chain recruitment by human IL-4. A type I receptor-selective IL-4 'superkine' with 3,700-fold higher affinity for γc was three- to ten-fold more potent than wild-type IL-4. Conversely, a variant with high affinity for IL-13Rα1 more potently activated cells expressing the type II receptor and induced differentiation of dendritic cells from monocytes, implicating the type II receptor in this process. Superkines showed signaling advantages on cells with lower second chain numbers. Comparative transcriptional analysis reveals that the superkines induce largely redundant gene expression profiles. Variable second chain numbers can be exploited to redirect cytokines toward distinct cell subsets and elicit new actions, potentially improving the selectivity of cytokine therapy."

The commonest treatment, minoxidil, was originally an antihypertensive drug that promoted unwanted hair. We hypothesized that another serendipitous discovery, increased eyelash growth side-effects of prostamide F2α-related eyedrops for glaucoma, may be relevant for scalp alopecias. Eyelash hairs and follicles are highly specialized and remain unaffected by androgens that inhibit scalp follicles and stimulate many others. Therefore, we investigated whether non-eyelash follicles could respond to bimatoprost, a prostamide F2α analog recently licensed for eyelash hypotrichosis. Bimatoprost, at pharmacologically selective concentrations, increased hair synthesis in scalp follicle organ culture and advanced mouse pelage hair regrowth in vivo compared to vehicle alone. A prostamide receptor antagonist blocked isolated follicle growth, confirming a direct, receptor-mediated mechanism within follicles; RT-PCR analysis identified 3 relevant receptor genes in scalp follicles in vivo. Receptors were located in the key follicle regulator, the dermal papilla, by analyzing individual follicular structures and immunohistochemistry. Thus, bimatoprost stimulates human scalp follicles in culture and rodent pelage follicles in vivo, mirroring eyelash behavior, and scalp follicles contain bimatoprost-sensitive prostamide receptors in vivo. This highlights a new follicular signaling system and confirms that bimatoprost offers a novel, low-risk therapeutic approach for scalp alopecias.—Khidhir, K. G., Woodward, D. F., Farjo, N.

https://openalex.org/W2158385484,"Although Rac and its activator Tiam1 are known to stimulate cell-cell adhesion, the mechanisms regulating their activity in cell-cell junction formation are poorly understood. Here, we identify β2-syntrophin as a Tiam1 interactor required for optimal cell-cell adhesion. We show that during tight-junction (TJ) assembly β2-syntrophin promotes Tiam1-Rac activity, in contrast to the function of the apical determinant Par-3 whose inhibition of Tiam1-Rac activity is necessary for TJ assembly. We further demonstrate that β2-syntrophin localizes more basally than Par-3 at cell-cell junctions, thus generating an apicobasal Rac activity gradient at developing cell-cell junctions. Targeting active Rac to TJs shows that this gradient is required for optimal TJ assembly and apical lumen formation. Consistently, β2-syntrophin depletion perturbs Tiam1 and Rac localization at cell-cell junctions and causes defects in apical lumen formation. We conclude that β2-syntrophin and Par-3 fine-tune Rac activity along cell-cell junctions controlling TJ assembly and the establishment of apicobasal polarity."
https://openalex.org/W1984089825,"The molecular mechanisms underlying the transport from the Golgi to the cell surface of G protein-coupled receptors remain poorly elucidated. Here we determined the role of Rab26, a Ras-like small GTPase involved in vesicle-mediated secretion, in the cell surface export of α(2)-adrenergic receptors. We found that transient expression of Rab26 mutants and siRNA-mediated depletion of Rab26 significantly attenuated the cell surface numbers of α(2A)-AR and α(2B)-AR, as well as ERK1/2 activation by α(2B)-AR. Furthermore, the receptors were extensively arrested in the Golgi by Rab26 mutants and siRNA. Moreover, Rab26 directly and activation-dependently interacted with α(2B)-AR, specifically the third intracellular loop. These data demonstrate that the small GTPase Rab26 regulates the Golgi to cell surface traffic of α(2)-adrenergic receptors, likely through a physical interaction. These data also provide the first evidence implicating an important function of Rab26 in coordinating plasma membrane protein transport."

CST-Ser-364 and CST-Val-367) were significantly less potent than the wild type peptide (CST-WT) to inhibit nicotine-stimulated catecholamine secretion from PC12 cells. Consistently, the rank-order of blockade of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-stimulated inward current and intracellular Ca(2+) rise by these peptides in PC12 cells was: CST-WT > CST-Ser-364 > CST-Val-367. Structural analysis by CD spectroscopy coupled with molecular dynamics simulations revealed the following order of α-helical content: CST-WT > CST-Ser-364 > CST-Val-367; docking of CST peptides onto a major human nAChR subtype and molecular dynamics simulations also predicted the above rank order for their binding affinity with nAChR and the extent of occlusion of the receptor pore, providing a mechanistic basis for differential potencies. The G364S polymorphism was in strong linkage disequilibrium with several common CHGA genetic variations. Interestingly, the Ser-364 allele (detected in ∼15% subjects) was strongly associated with profound reduction (up to ∼2.1-fold) in plasma norepinephrine/epinephrine levels consistent with the diminished nAChR desensitization-blocking effect of CST-Ser-364 as compared with CST-WT. Additionally, the Ser-364 allele showed strong associations with elevated levels of plasma triglyceride and glucose levels. In conclusion, a common CHGA variant in an Indian population influences several biochemical parameters relevant to cardiovascular/metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2040983597,"The gene network responsible for inflammation-induced insulin resistance remains enigmatic. In this study, we show that, in L6 cells, rosiglitazone- as well as pioglitazone-dependent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) represses transcription of the ped/pea-15 gene, whose increased activity impairs glucose tolerance in mice and humans. Rosiglitazone enhanced insulin-induced glucose uptake in L6 cells expressing the endogenous ped/pea-15 gene but not in cells expressing ped/pea-15 under the control of an exogenous promoter. The ability of PPARγ to affect ped/pea-15 expression was also lost in cells and in C57BL/6J transgenic mice expressing ped/pea-15 under the control of an exogenous promoter, suggesting that ped/pea-15 repression may contribute to rosiglitazone action on glucose disposal. Indeed, high fat diet mice showed insulin resistance and increased ped/pea-15 levels, although these effects were reduced by rosiglitazone treatment. Both supershift and ChIP assays revealed the presence of the AP-1 component c-JUN at the PED/PEA-15 promoter upon 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation of the cells. In these experiments, rosiglitazone treatment reduced c-JUN presence at the PED/PEA-15 promoter. This effect was not associated with a decrease in c-JUN expression. In addition, c-jun silencing in L6 cells lowered ped/pea-15 expression and caused nonresponsiveness to rosiglitazone, although c-jun overexpression enhanced the binding to the ped/pea-15 promoter and blocked the rosiglitazone effect. These results indicate that PPARγ regulates ped/pea-15 transcription by inhibiting c-JUN binding at the ped/pea-15 promoter. Thus, ped/pea-15 is downstream of a major PPARγ-regulated inflammatory network. Repression of ped/pea-15 transcription might contribute to the PPARγ regulation of muscle sensitivity to insulin. The gene network responsible for inflammation-induced insulin resistance remains enigmatic. In this study, we show that, in L6 cells, rosiglitazone- as well as pioglitazone-dependent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) represses transcription of the ped/pea-15 gene, whose increased activity impairs glucose tolerance in mice and humans.

https://openalex.org/W2152174894,"Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a serine protease selectively expressed on tumor stromal fibroblasts in epithelial carcinomas and is important in cancer growth, adhesion, and metastases. As FAP enzymatic activity is a potent therapeutic target, we aimed to identify inhibitory antibodies. Using a competitive inhibition strategy, we used phage display techniques to identify 53 single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) after three rounds of panning against FAP. These scFvs were expressed and characterized for binding to FAP by surface plasmon resonance and flow cytometry. Functional assessment of these antibodies yielded an inhibitory scFv antibody, named E3, which could attenuate 35% of FAP cleavage of the fluorescent substrate Ala-Pro-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin compared with nonfunctional scFv control. Furthermore, a mutant E3 scFv was identified by yeast affinity maturation. It had higher affinity (4-fold) and enhanced inhibitory effect on FAP enzyme activity (3-fold) than E3. The application of both inhibitory anti-FAP scFvs significantly affected the formation of 3-dimensional FAP-positive cell matrix, as demonstrated by reducing the fibronectin fiber orientation from 41.18% (negative antibody control) to 34.06% (E3) and 36.15% (mutant E3), respectively. Thus, we have identified and affinity-maturated the first scFv antibody capable of inhibiting FAP function. This scFv antibody has the potential to disrupt the role of FAP in tumor invasion and metastasis.—Zhang, J., Valianou, M., Simmons, H., Robinson, M. K., Lee, H.-O., Mullins, S. R., Marasco, W.
