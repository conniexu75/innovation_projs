Six Tau isoforms, differentiated by the presence or absence of a second repeat or of N-terminal inserts, exist in the human CNS, but their physiological and pathological differences have long remained elusive. Here, we investigated the properties and distributions of human and rodent Tau isoforms in primary forebrain rodent neurons. We found that the Tau diffusion barrier (TDB), located within the axon initial segment (AIS), controls retrograde (axon-to-soma) and anterograde (soma-to-axon) traffic of Tau. Tau isoforms without the N-terminal inserts were sorted efficiently into the axon. However, the longest isoform (2N4R-Tau) was partially retained in cell bodies and dendrites, where it accelerated spine and dendrite growth. The TDB (located within the AIS) was impaired when AIS components (ankyrin G, EB1) were knocked down or when glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β; an AD-associated kinase tethered to the AIS) was overexpressed. Using superresolution nanoscopy and live-cell imaging, we observed that microtubules within the AIS appeared highly dynamic, a feature essential for the TDB. Pathomechanistically, amyloid-β insult caused cofilin activation and F-actin remodeling and decreased microtubule dynamics in the AIS. Concomitantly with these amyloid-β–induced disruptions, the AIS/TDB sorting function failed, causing AD-like Tau missorting. In summary, we provide evidence that the human and rodent Tau isoforms differ in axodendritic sorting and amyloid-β–induced missorting and that the axodendritic distribution of Tau depends on AIS integrity.

https://openalex.org/W2618281650,"Sirtuin (Sirt)6 has been implicated in negative regulation of inflammation and lipid metabolism, although its function in the progression from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains to be defined. To explore the role of hepatocyte Sirt6 in NASH development, we generated hepatocyte-specific Sirt6-knockout (KO) mice that were fed a high-fat and high-fructose (HFHF) diet for 16 wk. HFHF-fed KO mice had increased hepatic steatosis and inflammation and aggravated glucose intolerance and insulin resistance compared with wild-type mice. HFHF-induced liver fibrosis and oxidative stress and related gene expression were significantly elevated in KO mice. In the livers of KO mice, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) was down-regulated; conversely, BTB domain and CNC homolog 1 (Bach1), a nuclear repressor of Nrf2, were up-regulated. We discovered that Sirt6, which interacts with Bach1 under basal condition, induces its detachment from the antioxidant response element (ARE) region of heme oxygenase 1 promoter. Furthermore, we found that Sirt6 promotes Nrf2 binding to ARE in response to oxidative stimuli, which leads to the expression of phase II/antioxidant enzymes. Finally, we showed that HFHF-induced steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis were ameliorated by adenoviral Sirt6 overexpression. Sirt6 may be a useful therapeutic target for amelioration of NASH by curbing inflammation and oxidative stress.—Ka, S.-O, Bang, I. H., Bae, E. J., Park, B.-H.

https://openalex.org/W2619375165,"Tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSCs) have been found in different anatomic locations and showed a promising regenerative potential. We identified a role of TSCs in the regulation of inflammation during healing of acute tendon injuries. Delivery of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) into full-transected rat patellar tendons significantly increased the number of CD146+ TSCs, leading to enhanced healing. In parallel, CTGF delivery significantly reduced the number of iNOS+ M1 macrophages and increased the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 at 2 d after surgery, with over 85% CD146+ TSCs expressing IL-10. By 1 wk, the elevated IL-10 expression remained, and IL-6 expression was significantly attenuated in CTGF-delivered tendon healing. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 expression in CTGF-delivered tendon was organized along with the reorienting collagen fibers by 1 wk after surgery, in comparison with the control group showing the abundant MMP-3 expression localized at healing junction. Tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease (TIMP)-3 was expressed in CD146+ TSCs at 1 wk with CTGF, in contrast to control with no TIMP-3 expression. In vitro, IL-10 expression was detected only when tendon cells were stimulated with IL-1β, and CTGF and significantly higher in CD146+ TSCs than CD146- tendon cells. Similarly, TIMP-3 expression was detected only when treated with CTGF or CTGF and IL-1β that is significantly higher in CD146+ TSCs compared to CD146- tendon cells. Signaling study with specific inhibitors and Western blot analysis demonstrated that CTGF-induced expression of IL-10 and TIMP-3 in CD146+ TSCs are regulated by JNK/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 signaling. Taken together, these findings suggest anti-inflammatory roles of CTGF-stimulated TSCs that are likely associated with improved tendon healing.-Tarafder, S., Chen, E., Jun, Y., Kao, K., Sim, K.

https://openalex.org/W2617506376,"The let-7/Lin28 axis is associated with the regulation of key cellular regulatory genes known as microRNAs in various human disorders and cancer development. This study evaluated the role of the let-7/Lin28 axis in regulating a mesenchymal phenotype of hepatic stellate cells in alcoholic liver injury. We identified that ethanol feeding significantly down-regulated several members of the let-7 family in mouse liver, including let-7a and let-7b. Similarly, the treatment of human hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) significantly decreased the expressions of let-7a and let-7b. Conversely, overexpression of let-7a and let-7b suppressed the myofibroblastic activation of cultured human HSCs induced by LPS and TGF-β, as evidenced by repressed ACTA2 (α-actin 2), COL1A1 (collagen 1A1), TIMP1 (TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 1), and FN1 (fibronectin 1); this supports the notion that HSC activation is controlled by let-7. A combination of bioinformatics, dual-luciferase reporter assay, and Western blot analysis revealed that Lin28B and high-mobility group AT-hook (HMGA2) were the direct targets of let-7a and let-7b. Furthermore, Lin28B deficiency increased the expression of let-7a/let-7b as well as reduced HSC activation and liver fibrosis in mice with alcoholic liver injury. This feedback regulation of let-7 by Lin28B is verified in hepatic stellate cells isolated by laser capture microdissection from the model. The identification of the let-7/Lin28 axis as an important regulator of HSC activation as well as its upstream modulators and down-stream targets will provide insights into the involvement of altered microRNA expression in contributing to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver fibrosis and novel therapeutic approaches for human alcoholic liver diseases.

https://openalex.org/W2620069112,"Glioblastomas (glioblastoma multiforme, GBM) are most malignant brain tumors characterized by profound vascularization. The activation of macrophages strongly contributes to tumor angiogenesis during GBM development. Previously, we showed that extracellular adenosine deaminase protein Cat Eye Syndrome Critical Region Protein 1 (CECR1) is highly expressed by M2-like macrophages in GBM where it defines macrophage M2 polarization and contributes to tumor expansion. In this study, the effect of CECR1 in macrophages on tumor angiogenesis was investigated. Immunohistochemical evaluation of GBM tissue samples showed that the expression of CECR1 correlates with microvascular density in the tumors, confirming data from the TCGA set. In a three-dimensional co-culture system consisting of human pericytes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and THP1-derived macrophages, CECR1 knockdown by siRNA and CECR1 stimulation of macrophages inhibited and promoted new vessel formation, respectively. Loss and gain of function studies demonstrated that PDGFB mRNA and protein levels in macrophages are modulated by CECR1. The proangiogenic properties of CECR1 in macrophages were partially mediated via paracrine activation of pericytes by PDGFB–PDGFRβ signaling. CECR1–PDGFB–PDGFRβ cross-activation between macrophages and pericytes promoted pericyte migration, shown by transwell migration assay, and enhanced expression and deposition of periostin, a matrix component with proangiogenic properties. CECR1 function in (M2-like) macrophages mediates cross talk between macrophages and pericytes in GBM via paracrine PDGFB–PDGFRβ signaling, promoting pericyte recruitment and migration, and tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, CECR1 offers a new portent target for anti-angiogenic therapy in GBM via immune modulation."

The copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (Ccs1) activates immature copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Sod1) by delivering copper and facilitating the oxidation of the Sod1 intramolecular disulfide bond. Here, we present structural, spectroscopic, and cell-based data supporting a novel copper-induced mechanism for Sod1 activation. Ccs1 binding exposes an electropositive cavity and proposed “entry site” for copper ion delivery on immature Sod1. Copper-mediated sulfenylation leads to a sulfenic acid intermediate that eventually resolves to form the Sod1 disulfide bond with concomitant release of copper into the Sod1 active site. Sod1 is the predominant disulfide bond-requiring enzyme in the cytoplasm, and this copper-induced mechanism of disulfide bond formation obviates the need for a thiol/disulfide oxidoreductase in that compartment.

The presence of a disulfide bond in Sod1 is unusual for an enzyme found predominantly in the highly reducing cytosolic environment. The two major cellular compartments in eukaryotes in which disulfide oxidation is commonly observed are the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and the mitochondrial intermembrane space, both of which contain thiol/disulfide oxidoreductases (for a review, see Ref. 23López-Mirabal H.R. Winther J.R. Redox characteristics of the eukaryotic cytosol.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of disulfide oxidation in nascent cytosolic Sod1 had been elusive until now, it is known that the disulfide bond is essential for full catalytic activity because it anchors the side chain of Arg143 adjacent to the catalytic copper ion where it helps to guide superoxide into the active site (24Ferraroni M.

U.S.A. 2012; 109: 13555-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In Ccs1-containing yeast, Sod1 mutants unable to bind copper in the active site remain largely disulfide-reduced (27Winkler D.D. Schuermann J.P. Cao X. Holloway S.P. Borchelt D.R. Carroll M.C.

The addition of Cu–Ccs1 to Zn–Sod1 fails to induce oxidation of the disulfide bond anaerobically, but this process is facile in the presence of oxygen or superoxide (21Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Oxygen-induced maturation of SOD1: a key role for disulfide formation by the copper chaperone CCS.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A previous yeast Sod1–Ccs1 crystal structure revealed an intermolecular disulfide between Cys57 of Sod1 and Cys229 of Ccs1, suggesting that the intermolecular disulfide may be an intermediate that eventually resolves to the Cys57–Cys146 disulfide via a disulfide exchange reaction (19Lamb A.L.

Unlike mammalian Sod1 proteins, yeast Sod1 proteins cannot acquire copper via the Ccs1-independent pathway in normal growth medium (10Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V.

The electrostatic loop of yeast Sod1 contains two proline residues that preclude the low levels of Ccs1-independent activation observed in the human and mouse enzymes (13Carroll M.C. Girouard J.B.

Replacement of the Pro residues (Pro142 and Pro144) in the yeast enzyme with their cognate residues from mammalian Sod1 proteins permits yeast enzyme activation via a Ccs1-indpendent pathway (13Carroll M.C.

These results also highlight the link between copper acquisition and disulfide bond formation. Here, we present structural, biochemical, and spectroscopic data that suggest a mechanism of Sod1 activation not described previously. Crystallographic studies on a new Sod1–Ccs1 complex reveal a cavity with positive electrostatic potential exposed by a previously unobserved β-hairpin conformation of Ccs1 D3 that embraces the Sod1 “disulfide loop,” displacing it from the β-barrel. Spectroscopic studies establish that Cu(I) is held at a Cys-Cys-His “entry site” adjacent to the electropositive cavity and Sod1–Ccs1 interface. In vivo studies of yeast Sod1 and its variants strongly suggest that the entry site is functionally relevant and that disulfide formation and copper delivery into the Sod1 active site are linked processes dependent on sulfenylation of Cys146. This new model is consistent with the vast majority of the biochemical data on Ccs1-mediated activation in the literature. Previous studies have highlighted the importance of the CXC motif in Ccs1 D3 for Sod1 activation (8Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Kozyreva T. Massagni C. Palumaa P. Rubino J.T. Zovo K.

Barbieri L. Bertini I. Luchinat E. Secci E. Zhao Y. Aricescu A.R. Atomic-resolution monitoring of protein maturation in live human cells by NMR.Nat. Chem.

We attempted to glean additional insights into the role of D3 by structurally characterizing the Sod1–Ccs1 heterocomplex and evaluating residue spacing within the CXC motif. Previously, Lamb et al. (19Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Heterodimeric structure of superoxide dismutase in complex with its metallochaperone.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) determined the structure of a yeast H48F Sod1–Ccs1 heterotetramer containing two Sod1–Ccs1 heterodimers in the asymmetric unit related by 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry. Heterotetramer assembly was mediated by reciprocal “swapping” interactions in which a highly conserved Ccs1 D3 237WEER240 α-helical motif bound to grooves on D2 of noncrystallographic symmetry-related heterodimers (supplemental Fig. S1) (19Lamb A.L.

Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To probe the importance of the 237WEER240 motif, we created a series of mutants targeting these residues. One variant, E238A/E239A/R240A (237WAAA240) demonstrated ∼5-fold greater yield and enhanced resistance to the trypsinolysis observed at Lys66 in the linker region between D2 and D3 in wild-type Ccs1 (18Lamb A.L.

The structure of the H46R/H48Q Sod1–E238A/E239A/R240A Ccs1 complex was determined by molecular replacement and refined in space group P21212 to a resolution of 2.35 Å. Table 1 provides the X-ray diffraction and structure refinement statistics. Although the asymmetric unit contains two Sod1–Ccs1 heterodimers related by noncrystallographic symmetry, the D3 conformation and heterodimeric orientations are dramatically different from the previous yeast H48F Sod1–Ccs1 heterotetramer structure (supplemental Fig. S2) (19Lamb A.L.

Here, we observed that extracellular lumican decreases PDAC tumour cell growth in xenograft and syngeneic orthotopic animal models, and induces growth inhibition of low-passage human PDAC cells in a species-specific manner. PDAC cells grown in variant culture conditions and exposed to extracellular lumican display typical characterizations of cancer cell in a quiescent state, such as growth inhibition, apoptosis, G0/G1 arrest and chemoresistance. Importantly, extracellular lumican is associated with diminished ERK1/2 phosphorylation and increased p38 phosphorylation within PDAC cells. We further demonstrated that extracellular lumican physically binds with EGFR to trigger EGFR internalization and downregulation of EGFR and its downstream signal molecule ERK. Lumican enhances casitas B-lineage lymphoma expression, which stabilized the TGFβ Type II receptor sensitizing PDAC cells to TGFβ-mediated activation of p38 and SMAD signals. These provide a mechanism for the shift in signalling and phenotypic changes we observed after prolonged exposure to lumican. Together, our findings demonstrate that stromal lumican restrains PDAC cell growth through mediating cell entry into a quiescent state."

Here, we posit that inflammatory and acute-phase proteins in the circulation increase after O3 exposure and systemically convey signals of O3 exposure to the CNS. To model acute O3 exposure, female Balb/c mice were exposed to 3 ppm O3 or forced air for 2 h and were studied after 6 or 24 h. Of 23 cytokines and chemokines, only KC/CXCL1 was increased in blood 6 h after O3 exposure. The acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (A-SAA) was significantly increased by 24 h, whereas C-reactive protein was unchanged. A-SAA in blood correlated with total leukocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage from O3-exposed mice. A-SAA mRNA and protein were increased in the liver. We found that both isoforms of A-SAA completely crossed the intact blood-brain barrier, although the rate of SAA2.1 influx was approximately 5 times faster than that of SAA1.1. Finally, A-SAA protein, but not mRNA, was increased in the CNS 24 h post-O3 exposure. Our findings suggest that A-SAA is functionally linked to pulmonary inflammation in our O3 exposure model and that A-SAA could be an important systemic signal of O3 exposure to the CNS.-Erickson, M.

https://openalex.org/W2619127576,"Tumor recurrence in glioblastoma (GBM) is, in part, attributed to increased epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and enhanced tumor cell dissemination in adjacent brain parenchyma after ionizing radiation (IR). EMT is associated with aggressive behavior, increased stem-like characteristics and treatment resistance in malignancies; however, the underlying signaling mechanisms that regulate EMT are poorly understood. We identified grade-dependent p21-activated kinases 4 (PAK4) upregulation in gliomas and further determined its role in mesenchymal transition and radioresistance. IR treatment significantly elevated expression and nuclear localization of PAK4 in correlation with induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mesenchymal transition in GBM cells. Stable PAK4 overexpression promoted mesenchymal transition by elevating EMT marker expression in these cells. Of note, transcription factor-DNA-binding arrays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments identified the formation of a novel nuclear PAK4/PPARγ complex which was recruited to the promoter of Nox1, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) target gene. In addition, IR further elevated PAK4/PPARγ complex co-recruitment to Nox1 promoter, and increased Nox1 expression and ROS levels associated with mesenchymal transition in these cells. Conversely, specific PAK4 downregulation decreased PPARγ-mediated Nox1 expression and suppressed EMT in IR-treated cells. In vivo orthotopic tumor experiments showed inhibition of growth and suppression of IR-induced PPARγ and Nox1 expression by PAK4 downregulation in tumors. Our results provide the first evidence of a novel role for PAK4 in IR-induced EMT and suggest potential therapeutic efficacy of targeting PAK4 to overcome radioresistance in gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2617627299,"Plant genomes are now sequenced rapidly and inexpensively. In silico approaches allow efficient development of simple sequence repeat markers, also known as microsatellite markers, from these sequences. A search of the genome sequence of 'Jefferson' hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) identified 8,708 tri-nucleotide simple sequence repeats with at least five repeat units, and stepwise removal of the less promising sequences led to the development of 150 polymorphic markers. Fragments in the 'Jefferson' sequence containing tri-nucleotide repeats were used as references and aligned with genomic sequences from seven other cultivars. Following in silico alignment, sequences that showed variation in number of repeat units were selected and primer pairs were designed for 243 of them. Screening on agarose gels identified 173 as polymorphic. Removal of duplicate and previously published sequences reduced the number to 150, for which fluorescent primers and capillary electrophoresis were used for amplicon sizing. These were characterized using 50 diverse hazelnut accessions. Of the 150, 132 generated the expected one or two alleles per accession while 18 amplified more than two amplicons in at least one accession. Diversity parameters of the 132 marker loci averaged 4.73 for number of alleles, 0.51 for expected heterozygosity (He), 0.49 for observed heterozygosity (Ho), 0.46 for polymorphism information content (PIC), and 0.04 for frequency of null alleles. The clustering of the 50 accessions in a dendrogram constructed from the 150 markers confirmed the wide genetic diversity and presence of three of the four major geographic groups: Central European, Black Sea, and Spanish-Italian. In the mapping population, 105 loci segregated, of which 101 were assigned to a linkage group (LG), with positions well-dispersed across all 11 LGs. These new markers will be useful for cultivar fingerprinting, diversity studies, genome comparisons, mapping, and alignment of the linkage map with the genome sequence and physical map."

HDJ-2 is implicated in the folding of proteins, whereas JB12 is multifunctional. JB12 is a component of ERQC complexes and triages ERAD-sensitive and -resistant forms of misfolded membrane proteins between pathways for proteasomal degradation or ERQC autophagy (8.Houck S.A.

Acta. 2012; 1818: 1108-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). JB12 also functions in a pathway with JB14 to facilitate the assembly of homotetrameric K+ channels. Notably JB12 and JB14 appear to facilitate different steps required for conversion of K+ channel monomers to tetramers (15.Li K. Jiang Q. Bai X. Yang Y.F. Ruan M.Y. Cai S.Q. Tetrameric assembly of K+ channels requires ER-located chaperone proteins.Mol. Cell. 2017; 65: 52-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Likewise, requirements for JB12 in ERQC-autophagy are not shared by JB14 (8.Houck S.A. Ren H.Y. Madden V.J. Bonner J.N. Conlin M.P. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Cyr D.M.

Cell. 2014; 54: 166-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). JB12 and JB14 help specify the actions of Hsp70 in ER homeostasis and contain divergent ER luminal DUF1977 (domain of unknown function) domains that could confer the observed specificity of their actions (10.Sopha P. Kadokura H. Yamamoto Y.H. Takeuchi M. Saito M. Tsuru A. Kohno K. A novel mammalian ER-located J-protein, DNAJB14, can accelerate ERAD of misfolded membrane proteins.Cell Struct. Funct. 2012; 37: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Interestingly, JB12 and JB14 expression is not induced by the UPR or heat stress (10.Sopha P. Kadokura H. Yamamoto Y.H. Takeuchi M. Saito M. Tsuru A. Kohno K. A novel mammalian ER-located J-protein, DNAJB14, can accelerate ERAD of misfolded membrane proteins.Cell Struct. Funct. 2012; 37: 177-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the processes that are facilitated by them in ERQC are dictated in part by the conformation of the clients to which each respective Hsp40 binds (8.Houck S.A.

Tetrameric assembly of K+ channels requires ER-located chaperone proteins.Mol. Cell. 2017; 65: 52-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The study of JB12 has received more attention than JB14, and JB12 is the primary focus of this study. Depletion of JB12 from mammalian cells did not cause a strong induction of the UPR but reduced cell growth rates and also sensitized cells to death caused by challenge of the ER with misfolded membrane proteins (8.Houck S.A. Ren H.Y. Madden V.J. Bonner J.N. Conlin M.P. Janovick J.A. Conn P.M. Cyr D.M. Quality control autophagy degrades soluble ERAD–resistant conformers of the misfolded membrane protein GnRHR.Mol. Cell. 2014; 54: 166-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). JB12, therefore, appears to participate in an ER stress–signaling circuit that senses fluctuations in loads of misfolded proteins to regulate induction of ER stress-induced apoptosis via a circuit that may lie outside of the UPR network. However, how JB12 functions to protect cells from ER stress–induced cell death is not clear. A basic understanding of how JB12 facilitates cross-talk between the UPR and heat–shock response systems to suppress ER stress-induced apoptosis requires information about how its activity is regulated. The study of this question was initiated through examination of the impact that acute ER stress caused by proteotoxic chemical stressors on JB12 and, for comparison, JB14 expression and function. Remarkably, JB12, but not JB14, was found to be stress-sensitive, as it was rapidly destabilized during challenge of the ER with the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT). Reductive stress caused by DTT appeared to alter the conformation of the DUF1977 domain on JB12 and cause its selection for degradation by the ERQC factors HERP, Sel1L, and the ERAD ubiquitin ligase gp78. Regions in the DUF1977 domain of JB12 and JB14 are not well conserved, and this may account for the differential sensitivity of them to DTT. JB12 is an ER-associated Hsp40 that is selectively degraded in response to ER stress. Huh-7 (human hepatoma cell line 7) liver carcinoma cells experience chronic ER stress as indicated by detection of high level expression of the glycoprotein chaperone calnexin, the ERQC E3 ligase RMA1, and the ER-associated BCL-2 protein BOK. BOK has an extremely short half-life and is constitutively degraded by ERAD, and its stress-dependent accumulation helps trigger the induction of ER stress-induced apoptosis (16.Llambi F. Wang Y.M. Victor B. Yang M. Schneider D.M. Gingras S. Parsons M.J. Zheng J.H. Brown S.A. Pelletier S. Moldoveanu T. Chen T. Green D.R.

Bouillet P. Bachmann D. Strasser A. Kaufmann T. Is BOK required for apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress?.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113: E492-E493Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). JB12 is detected in ERQC complexes that control BOK levels and stress-dependent depletion of JB12 from Huh-7 caused the accumulation of BOK, induction of caspase-9, -3, and -7 processing, and increased sensitivity to proteotoxic agents. JB12 is a multifunctional and ER stress–sensitive Hsp40 that functions to suppress BOK activity during normal growth. During severe bouts of ER stress the inactivation of JB12 appears to contribute to the elevation of BOK and the induction of ER stress–mediated apoptosis. Mechanisms by which JB12 functions to facilitate protein homeostasis and suppress ER stress-induced apoptosis will be discussed. To identify mechanisms for post-translational regulation of JB12 and JB14 in response to acute proteotoxic stress, COS-7 cells were challenged with chemicals that disrupt protein homeostasis in the ER membrane system, DTT, thapsigargin (Tg), or tunicamycin (Tm), or in the cytosol, bortezomib (Bort). Then, stress-dependent changes in levels of JB12, JB14, and different ERAD factors and cytosolic Hsp70 and Hsp40s were measured by Western blot (Fig. 1A). Under conditions where Bort inhibited the proteasome and increased the level of cytosolic Hsc70, there was no change in the level of JB12 or JB14 (Fig. 1A). Likewise, disruption of glycoprotein folding with Tm, which blocks N-linked glycosylation, had no effect on JB12 or JB14 levels. Yet, Tm clearly stressed cells because it caused an increase in the levels of the ER lumenal Hsp70 BiP, ER transmembrane calnexin, and the ERAD factors Derlin-1 and Derlin-3 (Fig. 1A). In stark contrast, a dramatic and selective decrease in levels of JB12, but not JB14, occurred when cells were challenged with the reducing agent DTT (Fig. 1A). Tg, an inhibitor of Serca2A that depletes the ER of Ca2+, caused a reduction in JB12 levels during the 6-h challenge. Yet, the effect of Tg was modest when compared with the impact of DTT on steady-state levels of JB12. ER stress caused by proteotoxic agents occurs in a time and dose-dependent fashion, so the impact of Tg on the apparent stability of JB12 was further explored in a time–course experiment in which the Tg concentration of 3 μm used in panel 1A was increased to 6 μm, and changes in JB12 levels were monitored over a longer 24-h period of challenge (Fig. 1B). The higher dose of Tg caused a detectable reduction in JB12 levels between 2 and 4 h of challenge, and near complete depletion occurred between 8 and 24 h. Time-dependent reductions in JB12 caused by Tg correlated with increasing levels of ER stress as indicated by increased accumulation of BiP. JB12 levels were reduced by DTT and Tg but not Tm. JB12 is not predicted to contain a Ca2+-binding domain, but its ER luminal DUF1977 domain contains conserved cysteine residues (7.Grove D.E. Fan C.Y. Ren H.Y. Cyr D.M. The endoplasmic reticulum-associated Hsp40 DNAJB12 and Hsc70 cooperate to facilitate RMA1 E3–dependent degradation of nascent CFTRΔF508.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that could be sensitive to changes in oxidative/reductive state of the ER lumen. DTT might, therefore, have a direct effect on the conformation of JB12, whereas impacts of Tg, which occur over a longer time period, could be an indirect result of the interference with function of Ca2+-dependent chaperones such as calnexin that participate in oxidative protein folding in the ER lumen (3.Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar). Tm may not impact the stability of JB12 because it interferes with N-linked glycosylation, and JB12 is not a glycoprotein. For these reasons the challenge of cells with DTT was employed as a model for ER stress to study the mechanism for stress-dependent degradation of JB12. If DTT was having a direct impact on the conformation of JB12, the destabilization of JB12 should occur before the ER becomes severely stressed (Fig. 1C). Indeed, in cells challenged with the low dose of 0.6 mm DTT for 2 h, the destabilization of JB12 occurs, whereas at the same time the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α) was not stimulated. The phosphorylation of eIF2α is mediated by the ER transmembrane kinase PERK in response to the ER stress-induced sequestration of BiP into complexes with misfolded proteins (3.Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar). Thus, DTT can rapidly destabilize JB12 in the absence of severe ER stress. In cycloheximide chase studies, DTT reduced the half-life of JB12 from 6 h to around 1.5 h (Fig. 1D). In these same cells the half-life of the short-lived RMA1 (19.Younger J.M. Chen L. Ren H.Y. Rosser M.F. Turnbull E.L. Fan C.Y. Patterson C. Cyr D.M. Sequential quality-control checkpoints triage misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.Cell. 2006; 126: 571-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), which is an ERQC ubiquitin ligase that interacts with JB12, was increased from 2 h to >6 h, whereas the half-life of Derlin-1, an ERQC factor present in complexes with JB12, was not detectably altered. Destabilization of JB12 occurs soon after challenge of cells with low doses of DTT and happens while its normally short-lived interaction partner RMA1 is stabilized. JB12 was identified as the first Hsp40 family member to be selectively destabilized in response to acute ER stress. JB12 contains an N-terminal J-domain, a transmembrane span, and an ER lumenal DUF1997 domain, and each could be sensitive to ER stress (Fig. 2A). Yet, DTT prevents oxidative folding within the ER lumen, so the logical ER stress–sensitive domain of JB12 is DUF1977. It is not clear what role the DUF1997 plays in JB12 function, but it is just >110 amino acid residues long (Fig. 2A) and is conserved in ER transmembrane Hsp40s that are expressed in organisms from yeast to man (7.Grove D.E. Fan C.Y. Ren H.Y. Cyr D.M. The endoplasmic reticulum-associated Hsp40 DNAJB12 and Hsc70 cooperate to facilitate RMA1 E3–dependent degradation of nascent CFTRΔF508.Mol. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 579-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). JB12 and JB14 both contain a DUF1977 domain, but the stability of JB12 is sensitive to stress, whereas JB14 is resistant to challenges that destabilize JB12. The differential stress sensitivity of JB12 and JB14 is consistent with observations that these Hsp40s share some overlapping functions but also have specific non-overlapping roles in ER homeostasis (15.Li K. Jiang Q. Bai X. Yang Y.F. Ruan M.Y. Cai S.Q. Tetrameric assembly of K+ channels requires ER-located chaperone proteins.Mol. Cell. 2017; 65: 52-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the JB12 and JB14 DUF1977 showed a high degree of identity in N-terminal regions, but there was a low degree of identity between their C termini (Fig. 2A). Such differences might explain why JB14 appears resistant to ER stress that destabilizes JB12. To gain experimental support that the DUF1977 of JB12 is sensitive to ER stress, N- and C-terminal epitope tags were placed on JB12. Then the sensitivity to DTT of the different forms of JB12 was determined (Fig. 2B). Overexpressed forms of wild-type and N-terminally FLAG-tagged JB12 were destabilized by DTT in a manner similar to endogenous JB12. However, the presence of an MYC tag on the C terminus abrogated the sensitivity of JB12 to DTT. The C terminus of JB12 is highly charged, so it may be disordered. The amino acid sequence of a MYC tag (Glu-Gln-Leu-Ile-Ser-Glu-Glu-Asp-Leu) contains a number of polar and charged amino acids. Therefore, interactions between residues within DUF1977 and the MYC tag have the potential to promote conformational changes that confer resistance of JB12 to DTT. JB12 contains two conserved cysteine residues that could be sensitive to DTT that are located at positions 329 and 363 of DUF1977 (Fig. 2A). The mutant C329A JB12 accumulates at a moderately lower level than JB12, but C329A JB12 remains sensitive to DTT. In contrast, accumulation of the mutant C363A JB12 was markedly reduced, and it was not sensitive to DTT. Therefore, Cys-363 appears to be important for folding of JB12 into stable conformation that is sensitive to DTT. Why JB14, which contains the same two conserved cysteine residues as JB12, is not sensitive to DTT, is not entirely clear. Yet, Cys-363 is located near the end of JB12, and the last 40 amino acids of the DUF1977 in JB12 and JB14 are highly divergent (Fig. 2A), These differences in amino acid composition may permit JB14, but not JB12, to adopt a stress-resistant state. The DUF1977 of JB12 might be metastable and, therefore, undergoes a conformational change that leads to its degradation during ER stress. If so, then the action of ER luminal chaperones should be required for maintenance of JB12 during normal growth, and forms of JB12 that are destabilized by stress might become substrates of BiP. Indeed, in unstressed cells, a small pool of endogenous BiP was detected in native immunoprecipitates with FLAG-JB12 (Fig. 3A). Upon challenge of cells with DTT, a 4-fold increase in the association of endogenous BiP with immunoprecipitated FLAG-JB12 occurred (Fig. 3A). In addition, the depletion of BiP by siRNA caused a reduction in JB12 levels, and the absence of BiP also increased the sensitivity of JB12 to DTT (Fig. 3B). Thus, depletion of BiP partially destabilizes JB12, and forms of JB12 that are destabilized by DTT are bound by BiP. The depletion of BiP by siRNA is nearly complete and is similar to challenge with DTT in that it caused the strong induction of ER stress (Fig. 3B). Levels of ER stress caused by the depletion of BiP were monitored by assaying decreases in the mobility of the kinase PERK on SDS-PAGE, which occur when PERK becomes activated through autophosphorylation (3.Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar). PERK appeared to be fully activated when BiP was depleted because BiP was no longer present to bind the ER lumenal regions of PERK and maintain it in an inactive state. Therefore, a concern about the evaluation of data from BiP siRNA knockdown studies is that the near complete loss of BiP from cells causes a stress that is severe enough to non-specifically destabilize JB12. Hence, it was asked if JB12 could also be destabilized under conditions where BiP was only partially depleted and the ER experienced low to moderate stress (Fig. 3C). The partial reduction of BiP in cells was achieved through the ectopic expression the cytotoxic endoprotease subtilase A, which accumulates in the ER lumen and cleaves BiP (21.Nakajima S. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Saito Y. Kato H. Huang T. Yao J. Paton A.W. Paton J.C. Kitamura M. Selective abrogation of BiP/GRP78 blunts activation of NF-κB through the ATF6 branch of the UPR: involvement of C/EBPβ and mTOR-dependent dephosphorylation of Akt.Mol. Cell Biol. 2011; 31: 1710-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with a subtilase A expression plasmid. Then at 24, 48, and 72 h post-transfection the levels of JB12, BiP, HERP, CHOP, and cleaved caspase 3 and 7 were measured by Western blot. After 24 h, JB12 levels were relatively unchanged, and levels of BiP were ∼50% below normal. Yet, at the 48-h time point, JB12 levels were 60% lower, and BiP was reduced by 70%. Notably, depletion of JB12 and BiP detected 48 h after transfection of the cells with the subtilase A expression plasmid was not associated with a strong induction ER stress. This is the case because pools of active and lower mobility forms of PERK were not strongly increased. In addition, induction of CHOP, an ER stress-responsive transcription factor that controls ER chaperone levels (3.Walter P. Ron D. The unfolded protein response: from stress pathway to homeostatic regulation.Science. 2011; 334: 1081-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (3914) Google Scholar), and processing of caspase 3 and 7 in subtilase A-expressing cells were well below the levels observed in DTT-treated cells. In addition, HERP expression were induced by the severe ER stress caused by DTT, but HERP levels were not increased when BiP was partially depleted by subtilase A (Fig. 3C). Partial depletion of BiP, under conditions where PERK is not strongly activated, leads to destabilization of JB12. JB12 has features of a metastable protein that requires BiP to maintain its steady-state levels in the ER. In addition, destabilized JB12 appears to misfold and be bound by BiP before its delivery to ERAD for degradation. In unstressed cells, JB12 functions in complexes with the ERQC E3 ligases RMA1 and gp78, where it acts with Hsp70 to triage non-native membrane proteins between folding and degradation pathways (7.Grove D.E. Fan C.Y. Ren H.Y. Cyr D.M. The endoplasmic reticulum-associated Hsp40 DNAJB12 and Hsc70 cooperate to facilitate RMA1 E3–dependent degradation of nascent CFTRΔF508.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked if destabilized JB12 becomes a substrate of the ERAD machinery with which its stable forms normally interact. Depletion of RMA1, CHIP, or HRD1 by siRNA did not have a remarkable impact on the DTT-dependent degradation of JB12 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the depletion of gp78, Sel1L, and HERP suppressed the degradation of JB12 caused by DTT. HERP and Sel1L act in the ER in heteroligomeric E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes that contain either HRD1 or gp78 that degrade both soluble and membrane-inserted conformers of misfolded proteins (22.Christianson J.C. Shaler T.A. Tyler R.E. Kopito R.R. OS-9 and GRP94 deliver mutant α1-antitrypsin to the Hrd1-SEL1L ubiquitin ligase complex for ERAD.Nat.

Modularity of the Hrd1 ERAD complex underlies its diverse client range.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 188: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). JB12 was detected in immunoprecipitable complexes with both Sel1L and HERP (Fig. 4B). In pulldowns where HERP-FLAG was the bait, Sel1L and JB12 were both detected. In pulldowns where MYC-Sel1L was the bait, JB12 was also detected in immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4C). Notably, the siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous HERP caused an ∼60% reduction in the association of JB12 with Sel1L (Fig. 4C). This result may explain why the knockdown of HERP hindered the degradation of JB12 caused by DTT. Treatment of cells with DTT reduced JB12 association with HERP and Sel1L, so damaged forms of JB12 appeared to be rapidly cleared from ERAD machinery. Sel1L/gp78 has been reported to for"

The fibrinogen-like (FBG) domain of FREP1 is highly conserved (>90% identical) among Anopheles species from different continents, suggesting that anti-FBG antibodies may block malaria transmission to all anopheline mosquitoes. Using standard membrane-feeding assays, anti-FREP1 polyclonal antibodies significantly blocked transmission of Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium vivax to Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles dirus, respectively. Furthermore, in vivo studies of mice immunized with FBG achieved >75% blocking efficacy of P. berghei to A. gambiae without triggering immunopathology. Anti-FBG serum also reduced >81% of P. falciparum infection to A. gambiae. Finally, we showed that FBG interacts with Plasmodium gametocytes and ookinetes, revealing the molecular mechanism of its antibody transmission-blocking activity. Collectively, our data support that FREP1-mediated Plasmodium transmission to mosquitoes is a conserved pathway and that targeting the FBG domain of FREP1 will limit the transmission of multiple Plasmodium species to multiple Anopheles species."
https://openalex.org/W2617018495,"Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is the regulatory protein that initiates cardiac contraction in response to Ca2+. TnC binding Ca2+ initiates a cascade of protein–protein interactions that begins with the opening of the N-terminal domain of cTnC, followed by cTnC binding the troponin I switch peptide (TnISW). We have evaluated, through isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular-dynamics simulation, the effect of several clinically relevant mutations (A8V, L29Q, A31S, L48Q, Q50R, and C84Y) on the Ca2+ affinity, structural dynamics, and calculated interaction strengths between cTnC and each of Ca2+ and TnISW. Surprisingly the Ca2+ affinity measured by isothermal titration calorimetry was only significantly affected by half of these mutations including L48Q, which had a 10-fold higher affinity than WT, and the Q50R and C84Y mutants, each of which had affinities 3-fold higher than wild type. This suggests that Ca2+ affinity of the N-terminal domain of cTnC in isolation is insufficient to explain the pathogenicity of these mutations. Molecular-dynamics simulation was used to evaluate the effects of these mutations on Ca2+ binding, structural dynamics, and TnI interaction independently. Many of the mutations had a pronounced effect on the balance between the open and closed conformations of the TnC molecule, which provides an indirect mechanism for their pathogenic properties. Our data demonstrate that the structural dynamics of the cTnC molecule are key in determining myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. Our data further suggest that modulation of the structural dynamics is the underlying molecular mechanism for many disease mutations that are far from the regulatory Ca2+-binding site of cTnC. Cardiac troponin C (cTnC) is the regulatory protein that initiates cardiac contraction in response to Ca2+. TnC binding Ca2+ initiates a cascade of protein–protein interactions that begins with the opening of the N-terminal domain of cTnC, followed by cTnC binding the troponin I switch peptide (TnISW). We have evaluated, through isothermal titration calorimetry and molecular-dynamics simulation, the effect of several clinically relevant mutations (A8V, L29Q, A31S, L48Q, Q50R, and C84Y) on the Ca2+ affinity, structural dynamics, and calculated interaction strengths between cTnC and each of Ca2+ and TnISW. Surprisingly the Ca2+ affinity measured by isothermal titration calorimetry was only significantly affected by half of these mutations including L48Q, which had a 10-fold higher affinity than WT, and the Q50R and C84Y mutants, each of which had affinities 3-fold higher than wild type. This suggests that Ca2+ affinity of the N-terminal domain of cTnC in isolation is insufficient to explain the pathogenicity of these mutations. Molecular-dynamics simulation was used to evaluate the effects of these mutations on Ca2+ binding, structural dynamics, and TnI interaction independently. Many of the mutations had a pronounced effect on the balance between the open and closed conformations of the TnC molecule, which provides an indirect mechanism for their pathogenic properties. Our data demonstrate that the structural dynamics of the cTnC molecule are key in determining myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. Our data further suggest that modulation of the structural dynamics is the underlying molecular mechanism for many disease mutations that are far from the regulatory Ca2+-binding site of cTnC. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (FHC) 4The abbreviations used are: FHC, familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; HCM, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; cTn, cardiac troponin; cTnC, cardiac troponin C; N-TnC, N-terminal domain of cTnC; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; MD, molecular dynamics; PMF, potential of mean force; MM, molecular mechanics; PBSA, Poisson Boltzmann surface area; BME, β-mercaptoethanol; PDB, Protein Data Bank; h-sasa, hydrophobic solvent-accessible surface. is the inherited form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes (1.Maron B.J.

There is a growing list of over 1000 mutations that have been associated with HCM, primarily in genes that code for sarcomeric proteins such as the cardiac troponin (cTn) complex (3.Harada K. Morimoto S. Inherited cardiomyopathies as a troponin disease.Jpn. J. Physiol. 2004; 54: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (4.Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G.

The cTn complex is composed of three proteins: cTnC, the Ca2+ sensing component; cTnI, the inhibitory subunit, and cTnT, that tethers the cTn complex to the cardiac thin filament (6.Parmacek M.S. Solaro R.J. Biology of the troponin complex in cardiac myocytes.Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 2004; 47: 159-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Mutations in cTnC have a pronounced functional effect because the sequence of cTnC is highly conserved throughout vertebrates (7.Gillis T.E. Marshall C.R. Tibbits G.F. Functional and evolutionary relationships of troponin C.Physiol. Genomics. 2007; 32: 16-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In cardiac contraction, the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration fluctuates between 100 nm in diastole and 400–1000 nm during systole (8.Bers D.M. Calcium fluxes involved in control of cardiac myocyte contraction.Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 9.Kirschenlohr H.L. Grace A.A. Vandenberg J.I. Metcalfe J.C. Smith G.A. Estimation of systolic and diastolic free intracellular Ca2+ by titration of Ca2+ buffering in the ferret heart.Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When Ca2+ binds to the regulatory N-terminal domain of cTnC (N-cTnC), a conformational change exposes a hydrophobic region on the surface, which binds to the “switch” region of cTnI. The Ca2+ signal ultimately permits actomyosin cross-bridge formation and force production (6.Parmacek M.S. Solaro R.J. Biology of the troponin complex in cardiac myocytes.Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 2004; 47: 159-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

By understanding the thermodynamic basis of the function of N-cTnC, we can explain this variation and explore the specific effects of disease-associated mutations. The function of cTnC and other Ca2+-sensing EF-hand proteins has been described as a balance between the opposing forces that push the cTnC molecule open and those that keep it closed (21.Gifford J.L. Walsh M.P. Vogel H.J. Structures and metal-ion-binding properties of the Ca2+-binding helix-loop-helix EF-hand motifs.Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 199-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). When Ca2+ binds N-cTnC, it creates a strain on the molecule, which is alleviated when N-cTnC changes conformation to better accommodate the presence of the ion; however, the energetic cost of the unfavorable exposure of a hydrophobic cleft provides a thermodynamic incentive to keep the N-cTnC molecule closed (21.Gifford J.L. Walsh M.P. Vogel H.J. Structures and metal-ion-binding properties of the Ca2+-binding helix-loop-helix EF-hand motifs.Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 199-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). The balance between these forces can be disrupted by sequence substitutions that alter the ability of N-cTnC to tolerate the conformational strain imposed by Ca2+ binding or substitutions that modify the hydrophobic cleft. The TnI switch peptide (TnISW) binds to TnC and stabilizes the open TnC conformation by occluding the hydrophobic cleft from the aqueous environment. The structural effects of Ca2+ binding have been examined through NMR and X-ray crystallographic data (22.Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagné S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D.

We propose that mutations that increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilament destabilize the closed conformation of N-cTnC, stabilize the open conformation of N-cTnC, and/or promote association with the TnISW peptide. The results presented in this work demonstrate that many N-cTnC mutations affect myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity by affecting the molecular motions that govern the regulation of cardiac contraction. The interaction between TnC and Ca2+ was endothermic for each of the TnC constructs except L48Q, which was exothermic. In each case the stoichiometric ratio (N) of Ca2+ binding to N-cTnC was 1:1, indicating that the regulatory site II was exclusively titrated during these experiments. Thermodynamic parameters are listed in Table 1, and ITC isotherms are shown in Fig. 2. At 25 °C each of the Kd values was within error from the WT, with the exceptions Q50R and C84Y, which each had Kd values approximately one-third of WT, and L48Q, in which the Kd was one-tenth of WT. The ΔS values were lower than WT for A31S, L48Q, Q50R, and C84Y. The ΔH values were less favorable than WT for A31S, Q50R, and C84Y but more favorable than WT for the L48Q construct.Table 1Thermodynamic parameters derived from ITCN-cTnC constructNKdΔSΔHΔGμmJ·mol−1·deg−1J·mol−1kJ·mol−1WT1.05 ± 1e-214.9 ± 0.7140.5 ± 21.43e4 ± 6e2−2.76e4 ± 1e2A8V1.01 ± 2e-215.3 ± 0.9141.6 ± 21.47e4 ± 4e2−2.75e4 ± 2e2L29Q0.99 ± 1e-214.2 ± 0.4145.0 ± 11.56e4 ± 4e2−2.77e4 ± 5e1A31S0.88 ± 3e-211.8 ± 1.1124.5 ± 2aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).8.99e3 ± 3e2aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).−2.81e4 ± 2e2L48Q1.02 ± 3e-21.48 ± 0.1aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).50.1 ± 1aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).−1.84e4 ± 2e2aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).−3.33e4 ± 8e1aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).Q50R1.05 ± 1e-25.85 ± 0.1aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).120.8 ± 1aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).6.15e3 ± 1e2aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).−2.99e4 ± 8e1aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).C84Y0.96 ± 2e-24.19 ± 0.9aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).113.9 ± 2aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).3.12e3 ± 1e2aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).−3.09e4 ± 5e2aSignificant difference from WT (p < 0.05).a Significant difference from WT (p < 0.05). Open table in a new tab The melting points for all Apo TnC constructs were ∼65 °C, with the exceptions of A8V at 58.5 °C and L48Q at 42.5 °C (supplemental Table S2). Each of the simulations diverged from the original coordinates (supplemental Fig. S1). The representative structures are very similar with a total backbone root mean square deviation of 1.9 Å. The local backbone dynamics are similar over 100 ns (supplemental Fig. S1). The mutations produce small backbone perturbations compared with WT in their respective local regions and have backbone root mean square deviation values that differ only by 1.2–2.4 Å. The mutations can; however, substantially disrupt the packing of interacting side chains for mutated residues that are not solvent-exposed: A8V, L48Q, Q50R, and C84Y. The L29Q and A31S substitutions affect fewer residues, but each introduces a hydrogen bond absent from the WT structure (Fig. 3). Compared with WT, the A8V model has a modified interaction between the N and D helices, specifically a hydrophobic interaction with that involves residues Tyr-5, Ala-8, Val-9, and Leu-12 on the N-helix and Leu-78, Val-79, and Val-82 on the D helix. In the L29Q model, Gln-29 is solvent-exposed, but the side chain amide is within hydrogen bonding distance of the Ile-26 backbone O. The A31S substitution is in the EF-hand site I loop, and Ser-31 is within interacting distance of the Cys-35 backbone O, which, in the WT model, interacts with the backbone O of Leu-29. The L48Q substitution disrupts a hydrophobic network in the core of the AB-helical interface that is composed of Phe-19, Ala-23, Cys-35, Val-44, Glu-76, and Met-80. The side chain amide of Gln-49 is within interacting distance of the backbone O of Met-47. The Q50R substitution, located between helices B and C, alters helix C of the molecule, and interaction between Gln-50 and the backbone O of Leu-48 is replaced by a series of hydrogen bonds between Arg-50 and Cys-84, in addition to both side chain O atoms of Glu-56. Finally, the C84Y substitution disrupts a hydrophobic interaction between Cys-84 with Met-60, Met-45, Pro-52 and Gln-50. Instead, Tyr-84 is within interacting distance with the backbone O of Met-60. The Ca2+ coordination geometry and distances are similar for all constructs with the exception of A8V, which has tighter Ca2+ coordination geometry (supplemental Table S3). This is likely correlated with the potential of mean force (PMF) results discussed in detail below. The average number of H-bonds in each mutant structure is the same over the course of each simulation, as are the average hydrophobic solvent-accessible surface (h-sasa) in the closed and open forms (supplemental Table S4); however, monitoring the A/B interhelical angle (Fig. 4) and h-sasa (supplemental Fig. S3) over repeated 1-μs simulations demonstrates the frequency with which the TnC protein exposes the hydrophobic patch. The L29Q construct is least frequently open, followed in order by C84Y < A8V < WT < Q50R <A31S, and <L48Q. One of the replicated L29Q simulations had very high AB interhelical angles for a time; this was due to a transient loss of secondary structure, although it did not affect the exposed hydrophobic sasa (supplemental Fig. S2). The interhelical angle data can be expressed as the probability of observing the open conformation of the protein. An angle of 110° has been described as the maximum angle that can be considered open. The proportion of frames in which the N-cTnC molecule had an open AB interhelical angle was 0 for the A8V, L29Q, and C84Y constructs, 0.004% for the Q50R construct, 0.008% for WT, 0.016% for A31S, and 0.07% for the L48Q N-cTnC (Fig. 5). By defining cutoff angles for the transition between closed and open at 130° and 110°, we can determine the probability of observing the N-cTnC molecule in the closed state (AB interhelical angle >130°) and gain insight on the relative stability of the closed conformation (Fig. 5). The A8V construct has the lowest closed probability at 58%, followed by C84Y at 65%, WT and L48Q at 76%, Q50R at 86, A31S at 88%, and finally L29Q at 92%.Figure 5Violin plot demonstrating the distribution of open and closed N-cTnC structures observed over five replicated 1-μs simulations. The open conformation was defined by an AB interhelical angle less than 110°, whereas the closed conformation was defined by an AB interhelical angle greater than 130°. The proportion of open frames is not correlated with the proportion of closed frames. The L48Q construct has the most frames in the open conformation, whereas the A8V is the least closed. This suggests that the destabilization of the closed conformation does not necessarily imply that the open conformation is stabilized.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The effects on the structural interactions between the TnC molecule and TnISW are subtle when averaged across the simulations (Fig. 6), and as expected, the majority of the specific contacts are maintained when each of the N-cTnC mutants are compared with WT N-cTnC. The TnISW remains in contact with the TnC molecule for the duration of the simulations, but the specificity of that contact is somewhat different in response to certain mutations. For example: L29Q, A31S, and Q50R make more common contacts between the N-terminal region of TnISW and the N-helix of TnC than WT, whereas L48Q and C84Y make fewer contacts than WT in this region. These results suggest that alterations in this binding interface m"
https://openalex.org/W2619972925,"Wnt signaling pathways are of significant interest in development and oncogenesis. The first step in these pathways typically involves the binding of a Wnt protein to the cysteine-rich domain (CRD) of a Frizzled receptor. Wnt-Frizzled interactions can be antagonized by secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs), which also contain a Frizzled-like CRD. The large number of Wnts, Frizzleds, and SFRPs, as well as the hydrophobic nature of Wnt, poses challenges to laboratory-based investigations of interactions involving Wnt. Here, utilizing structural knowledge of a representative Wnt-Frizzled CRD interaction, as well as experimentally determined binding affinities for a selection of Wnt-Frizzled CRD interactions, we generated homology models of Wnt-Frizzled CRD interactions and developed a quantitative structure-activity relationship for predicting their binding affinities. The derived model incorporates a small selection of terms derived from scoring functions used in protein-protein docking, as well as an energetic term considering the contribution made by the lipid of Wnt to the Wnt-Frizzled binding affinity. Validation with an external test set suggests that the model can accurately predict binding affinity for 75% of cases and that the error associated with the predictions is comparable with the experimental error. The model was applied to predict the binding affinities of the full range of mouse and human Wnt-Frizzled and Wnt-SFRP interactions, indicating trends in Wnt binding affinity for Frizzled and SFRP CRDs. The comprehensive predictions made in this study provide the basis for laboratory-based studies of previously unexplored Wnt-Frizzled and Wnt-SFRP interactions, which, in turn, may reveal further Wnt signaling pathways.

The comprehensive predictions made in this study provide the basis for laboratory-based studies of previously unexplored Wnt-Frizzled and Wnt-SFRP interactions, which, in turn, may reveal further Wnt signaling pathways. The Wnt signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway found in vertebrates and insects (1Holstein T.W. The evolution of the Wnt pathway.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a007922Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It functions to regulate body axis formation, cell fate, cell proliferation, and morphogenesis in embryonic development (2Hikasa H. Sokol S.Y. Wnt signaling in vertebrate axis specification.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a007955Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), whereas aberrant Wnt signaling is a hallmark of many cancers (3Polakis P. Wnt signaling in cancer.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a008052Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling pathways can be divided into three separate branches: a canonical or β-catenin-dependent pathway and two non-canonical or β-catenin-independent pathways, known as the planar cell polarity (PCP) 4The abbreviations used are: PCPplanar cell polarityCRDcysteine-rich domainFzdFrizzledSFRPsecreted Frizzled-related proteinLRPlow-density lipoprotein-related proteinDvlDishevelledGSK3glycogen synthase kinase 3CK1casein kinase 1CncalcineurinROCKRho-associated protein kinaseXWnt8Xenopus Wnt8GPCRG protein–coupled receptorBLIbiolayer interferometrycoIPco-immunoprecipitationmFzdmouse FzdRMSDroot-mean-squared deviationmWntmouse WnthWnthuman WnthFzdhuman FzdRMSEroot-mean-squared errorRORreceptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor. and Wnt/Ca2+ pathways (4Komiya Y. Habas R. Wnt signal transduction pathways.Organogenesis. 2008; 4: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar, 5Pohl S. Ö.-G Brook N. Agostino M. Arfuso F. Kumar A.P. Dharmarajan A. Wnt signaling in triple-negative breast cancer.Oncogenesis. 2017; 6: e310Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Wnt signaling is generally initiated by the binding of Wnt ligands to a Frizzled (Fzd) receptor (6Dijksterhuis J.P. Petersen J. Schulte G. WNT/Frizzled signalling: receptor-ligand selectivity with focus on FZD-G protein signalling and its physiological relevance: IUPHAR Review 3.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 1195-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (Fig. 1a), low-density lipoprotein-related protein 5/6 (LRP5/6) acts as a co-receptor for Wnt binding (7He X. Semenov M. Tamai K. Zeng X. LDL receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 in Wnt/β-catenin signaling: arrows point the way.Development. 2004; 131: 1663-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Signal transduction by the three major Wnt signaling pathways is regulated by the interaction of Fzd with the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dvl) (8Wallingford J.B. Habas R. The developmental biology of Dishevelled: an enigmatic protein governing cell fate and cell polarity.Development. 2005; 132: 4421-4436Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In the canonical pathway, β-catenin-dependent signaling is mediated through the cytoplasmic “destruction complex” composed of Axin, protein phosphatase 2A, adenomatous polyposis coli protein, glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), and casein kinase 1α (CK1α) (9Clevers H. Wnt/β-catenin signaling in development and disease.Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4491) Google Scholar). In the presence of Wnt stimulation, Fzd is activated, permitting Dvl binding and resulting in the stabilization of the destruction complex and the accumulation of non-phosphorylated β-catenin, which then translocates to the nucleus and binds to T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor transcription factors on the promoter of target genes (4Komiya Y. Habas R. Wnt signal transduction pathways.Organogenesis. 2008; 4: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In the absence of Wnt stimulation, the destruction complex is destabilized, allowing for the phosphorylation of β-catenin by CK1α and GSK3 (10Huelsken J. Behrens J. The Wnt signalling pathway.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3977-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar); phosphorylated β-catenin is then proteolytically degraded (11Stamos J.L. Weis W.I. The β-catenin destruction complex.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a007898Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). The Wnt/Ca2+ pathway (Fig. 1b) is activated through Wnt ligands binding to Fzd receptors, resulting in an increase in intracellular calcium (12Kohn A.D. Moon R.T. Wnt and calcium signaling: β-catenin-independent pathways.Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Calcium ions are able to activate both calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (13Kühl M. Sheldahl L.C. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II is stimulated by Wnt and Frizzled homologs and promotes ventral cell fates in Xenopus.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12701-12711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (PKC) (14Sheldahl L.C. Park M. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Protein kinase C is differentially stimulated by Wnt and Frizzled homologs in a G-protein-dependent manner.Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 695-698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), which subsequently activate transcription factors NFκB and cAMP-response element-binding protein. The cytosolic phosphatase calcineurin (Cn) is also activated by calcium ions. Cn-dependent dephosphorylation and activation of nuclear factor of activated T cells lead to the transcription of genes in cardiomyocytes, neuronal cells, and skeletal muscle (15De A. Wnt/Ca2+ signaling pathway: a brief overview.Acta Biochim. Biophys. Sin. 2011; 43: 745-756Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Signal transduction via the PCP pathway (Fig. 1c) is initiated through Wnt binding to Fzd and co-receptors ROR and Ryk. Fzd activation leads to Dvl-mediated activation of Rac and Rho. JNK and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) are activated by Rac and Rho, respectively, which mediates actin polymerization and activates transcription factors AP-1 and JUN (16Green J.

Wnts comprise a group of 19 proteins that are subject to numerous post-translational modifications, including the formation of a large number of characteristic disulfide bonds, glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum (17Smolich B.D. McMahon J.A. McMahon A.P. Papkoff J. Wnt family proteins are secreted and associated with the cell surface.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), and palmitoylation by Porcupine, which aids in their secretion and facilitates their interaction with Frizzled (18Gao X. Hannoush R.N. Single-cell imaging of Wnt palmitoylation by the acyltransferase porcupine.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Structurally, as determined by the co-crystallization of Xenopus Wnt8 (XWnt8) with the mouse Fzd8 CRD, Wnts are composed of two domains: an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain (19Janda C.Y. Waghray D. Levin A.M. Thomas C. Garcia K.C. Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled.Science. 2012; 337: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains 10 cysteine residues forming five disulfide bridges in a cluster of α-helices, whereas the C-terminal domain contains six disulfide bridges and a two-stranded β-sheet (19Janda C.Y. Waghray D. Levin A.M. Thomas C. Garcia K.C. Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled.Science. 2012; 337: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Frizzled receptors are a group of 10 membrane-bound receptors comprising the majority of Class F G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). Frizzleds, like other GPCRs, consist of seven hydrophobic transmembrane helices but feature an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) in their N terminus (20Wang Y. Macke J.P. Abella B.S. Andreasson K. Worley P. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nathans J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 4468-4476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The CRD is characterized by a conserved pattern of 10 cysteines and can bind Wnt and Norrin ligands (21Xu Q. Wang Y. Dabdoub A. Smallwood P.M. Williams J. Woods C. Kelley M.W. Jiang L. Tasman W. Zhang K. Nathans J.

The five mammalian secreted Frizzled-related proteins (SFRPs) are secreted glycoproteins composed of an N-terminal CRD and a C-terminal netrin-like domain (23Surana R. Sikka S. Cai W. Shin E.M. Warrier S.R. Tan H.J. Arfuso F. Fox S.A. Dharmarajan A.M. Kumar A.P. Secreted frizzled related proteins: implications in cancers.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1845: 53-65PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins function to antagonize the Wnt signaling pathway (24Cruciat C.M. Niehrs C. Secreted and transmembrane Wnt inhibitors and activators.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a015081Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) through binding of either the CRD (25Dann C.E. Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Sharma D. Nathans J. Leahy D.J. Insights into Wnt binding and signalling from the structures of two Frizzled cysteine-rich domains.Nature. 2001; 412: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar) or the netrin-like domain to Wnt ligands (26Lopez-Rios J. Esteve P. Ruiz J.M. Bovolenta P. The Netrin-related domain of Sfrp1 interacts with Wnt ligands and antagonizes their activity in the anterior neural plate.Neural Dev. 2008; 3: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), thus interfering with Wnt binding to Fzd and preventing β-catenin-mediated gene transcription. The SFRPs have been studied in great detail for their potential roles as tumor suppressors and their implications in carcinogenesis (23Surana R. Sikka S. Cai W. Shin E.M. Warrier S.R. Tan H.J. Arfuso F. Fox S.A. Dharmarajan A.M. Kumar A.P. Secreted frizzled related proteins: implications in cancers.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1845: 53-65PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the large number of possible Wnt-Fzd CRD interactions (which, considering CRDs from both Fzds and SFRPs, totals 285 interactions per species), it is challenging to investigate these experimentally. A recent study utilized biolayer interferometry (BLI) to investigate a small set of mouse Wnt-Fzd CRD interactions in a combinatorial manner (27Dijksterhuis J.P. Baljinnyam B. Stanger K. Sercan H.O. Ji Y. Andres O. Rubin J.S. Hannoush R.N. Schulte G. Systematic mapping of WNT-FZD protein interactions reveals functional selectivity by distinct WNT-FZD pairs.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 6789-6798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Numerous other interactions have been identified via co-immunoprecipitation (coIP) or proposed based on co-expression of particular Wnts with particular Fzds (6Dijksterhuis J.P. Petersen J. Schulte G. WNT/Frizzled signalling: receptor-ligand selectivity with focus on FZD-G protein signalling and its physiological relevance: IUPHAR Review 3.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2014; 171: 1195-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although coIP and co-expression are valuable methods for suggesting the existence of specific protein-protein interactions, they are unable to provide an indication of the likely strength of an interaction. Computational studies provide the opportunity to complete the knowledge of interactions between Wnts and Fzd CRDs and may reveal previously unexplored high-affinity interactions. In this study, we have generated homology models of Wnt complexes with both Fzd and SFRP CRDs and predict the likely binding affinity associated with these interactions. For a series of Wnt-Fzd CRD interactions for which dissociation constants have been reported (27Dijksterhuis J.P. Baljinnyam B. Stanger K. Sercan H.O. Ji Y. Andres O. Rubin J.S. Hannoush R.N. Schulte G. Systematic mapping of WNT-FZD protein interactions reveals functional selectivity by distinct WNT-FZD pairs.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 6789-6798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we then evaluated the interaction energy for the protein-protein and lipid-protein components of the interactions; this was achieved through scoring the interactions against the full set of functions contained in CCharPPI (28Moal I.H. Jiménez-García B. Fernández-Recio J. CCharPPI web server: computational characterisation of protein-protein interactions from structure.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (for the protein-protein component) and scoring using Prime MM-GB/SA (for the lipid-protein component). Strike was then used to develop and evaluate binding affinity prediction models using scores obtained from CCharPPI and Prime MM-GB/SA as descriptors for the model building. A model with high predictive performance was identified and subsequently applied to predict the binding affinities of all Wnt-Fzd and Wnt-SFRP CRD interactions in both mouse and human cases. We prepared homology models of all mouse and human Wnts and all mouse and human Fzd and SFRP CRDs; details of UniProt accession numbers, sequence ranges, and sequence alignments used to build the models are provided in supplemental Table S1 and Figs. S2 and S3. The vast majority of proteins modeled did not feature large insertions or deletions relative to either XWnt8 or mFzd8 CRD with the exceptions of mouse and human Wnt6, Wnt10a, and Wnt10b; these Wnts feature insertions relative to XWnt8 larger than that able to be built by Prime (greater than 20 residues). To build these structures, we utilized an alternative procedure incorporating the I-TASSER server (described in detail under “Experimental procedures”), which is capable of building much longer insertions than Prime through its use of an iterative template fragment assembly approach to model building (29Yang J. Yan R. Roy A. Xu D. Poisson J. Zhang Y. The I-TASSER Suite: protein structure and function prediction.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 7-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (3731) Google Scholar). Following assembly of the complexes and refinement using a procedure automated using KNIME (supplemental Fig. S4), the MolProbity score of all models was calculated. The MolProbity score provides a single value metric of structural quality, summarizing the number of atomic clashes, percentage of backbone conformations in regions outside the Ramachandran favored regions, and the percentage of bad side-chain rotamers (30Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Headd J.J. Keedy D.A. Immormino R.M. Kapral G.J. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. MolProbity: all-atom structure validation for macromolecular crystallography.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (9818) Google Scholar). The TM-score and the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) of the Cα atoms of the models with respect to the XWnt8-mFzd8 CRD complex structure (Protein Data Bank code 4F0A) (19Janda C.Y. Waghray D. Levin A.M. Thomas C. Garcia K.C. Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled.Science. 2012; 337: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), which was the template for all models, were also calculated. These measures assess differences in the coordinates of two structures (31Zhang Y. Skolnick J. Scoring function for automated assessment of protein structure template quality.Proteins. 2004; 57: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). The mean value for the MolProbity scores for the mouse and human models was slightly greater than the MolProbity score obtained for the XWnt8-mFzd8 CRD complex structure (Table 1) but nonetheless comparable, indicating the generally high quality of the models. The mean values for the model TM-scores with respect to the template crystal structure were generally high, and the mean values for the model Cα RMSD values very low, further indicating the generally high quality of the models and their limited divergence from the template crystal structure. Selected complexes are shown in Fig. 2.

Open table in a new tab We used a set of mouse Wnt-Fzd CRD binding affinities determined by BLI (27Dijksterhuis J.P. Baljinnyam B. Stanger K. Sercan H.O. Ji Y. Andres O. Rubin J.S. Hannoush R.N. Schulte G. Systematic mapping of WNT-FZD protein interactions reveals functional selectivity by distinct WNT-FZD pairs.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 6789-6798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) to develop and validate our binding affinity prediction model. The model building and evaluation procedure is summarized in Fig. 3 and herein described. Within the BLI data, we designated a training set, used to optimize the model, and a test set, used to demonstrate the performance of the model for data against which it had not been trained. Our training set was designated as complexes that were not part of our test set; our test set consisted of complexes involving interactions with either mFzd1 or mWnt4. The definition of the test set in this manner provided a simple means of selecting a test set covering a wide range of affinities. For all of these complexes, we then rescored, with separate procedures, the protein-protein portion and the lipid-protein portion of the interaction. The protein-protein portion was rescored against the majority of functions available within CCharPPI (28Moal I.H. Jiménez-García B. Fernández-Recio J. CCharPPI web server: computational characterisation of protein-protein interactions from structure.Bioinformatics. 2015; 31: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (listed in supplemental Table S11), a server compiling a wide range of scoring functions suitable for use in protein-protein docking. The lipid-protein portion was rescored used Prime MM-GB/SA, which provides a rapid means for evaluating ligand-receptor binding energies with improved accuracy compared with typical docking scoring functions. The Prime MM-GB/SA calculation is also decomposed into its components (Coulomb/electrostatic, covalent binding, van der Waals, lipophilic, polar solvation/desolvation, hydrogen bonding, and π-π components; components used in this study listed in supplemental Table S11). The two strategies function complementarily to one another; the functions in CCharPPI are only capable of considering interactions between standard protein amino acids, whereas Prime MM-GB/SA is capable of studying interactions between small organic molecules with proteins. With this in mind, the Wnt lipid was removed from the CCharPPI calculations, and the Wnt protein was removed from the Prime MM-GB/SA calculations (that is, only the interaction between the Wnt lipid and the Fzd CRD was assessed by Prime MM-GB/SA). Multiple linear regression models combining one Prime MM-GB/SA component with one or more CCharPPI components (all herein referred to as descriptors) were then generated, thus allowing the development of a single model considering both the protein-lipid and the protein-protein portions of the interaction. As it was computationally accessible to consider all possible three-descriptor models incorporating one Prime MM-GB/SA term and two CCharPPI-derived terms, we initially explored these. The performance of all models was evaluated using two principal metrics: 1) the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between the predicted values and the average experimental values (RMSEtrain and RMSEtest); lower values indicate a better fit between the predictions and experimental values; and 2) the percentage of complexes for which the predicted value occurred within the experimental range reported (InExptrain and InExptest); higher values indicate a better fit between the predictions and experimental values. High-performing three-descriptor models of Wnt-Fzd CRD binding typically incorporated the van der Waals term of the Prime MM-GB/SA calculation (supplemental Table S12). The lipophilic term of the Prime MM-GB/SA calculation also appears frequently in high-performing models. This is unsurprising considering the physicochemical properties of palmitoleic acid, which would suggest that the binding energy will likely be associated with van der Waals/non-polar interactions. The best performing three-descriptor models generally displayed RMSEs for both the training and test sets in the range of 0.3–0.4 kcal/mol, which is well outside the error range of the experiments of ∼0.2–0.3 kcal/mol (27Dijksterhuis J.P.

Two models containing four descriptors were identified that were capable of high-prediction performance (Table 2). Both of these displayed RMSEs for the training and test sets less than 0.3 kcal/mol. Both included the van der Waals term of the Prime MM-GB/SA calculation, the PyRosetta hydrogen bonding potential (HBOND2) (32Chaudhury S. Lyskov S. Gray J.J.

As the performance of Model 1 appeared slightly improved over Model 2, this model was selected for further study. Additionally, Model 1 was preferred over Model 2 for featuring a smaller constant term, suggesting that it may be able to predict affinities over a wider range than Model 2. The RMSE values for Model 1 suggest that the error associated with its use will be slightly larger than, but nonetheless similar to, the error range achieved by experiment.Table 2Best performing four-descriptor models predicting Wnt-Fzd CRD binding energyNumberModelRMSEtrainRMSEtestInExptrainInExptestkcal/molkcal/mol%%1ΔG = 0.0038165 × AP_calRW − 0.22506 × MMGBSA dG Bind vdW − 0.24626 × HBOND2 − 0.049875 × FIREDOCK_AB − 3.34750.230.2780752ΔG = 0.0021829 × AP_calRWp − 0.22111 × MMGBSA dG Bind vdW − 0.20861 × HBOND2 − 0.08699 × ROSETTADOCK − 7.79740.300.237375 Open table in a new tab The maximum difference between any prediction made by the model, either in the training set or the test set, is ∼0.6 kcal/mol, which corresponds to a difference in Kd of approximately an order of magnitude (Fig. 4 and Table 3). Because there appears to be no particular Wnts or Fzds for which poor predictions are made, failure to make accurate predictions most likely occurs randomly and is not associated with a particular Wnt or Fzd structure; this is perhaps expected given the overall high structural quality of the models used.

https://openalex.org/W2619847932,"Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are devastating sarcomas for which no effective medical therapies are available. Over 50% of MPSNTs are associated with mutations in NF1 tumor suppressor gene, resulting in activation of Ras and its effectors, including the Raf/Mek/Erk and PI3K/Akt/mTORC1 signaling cascades, and also the WNT/β-catenin pathway. As Group I p21-activated kinases (Group I Paks, PAK1/2/3) have been shown to modulate Ras-driven oncogenesis, we asked if these enzymes might regulate signaling in MPNSTs. In this study we found a strong positive correlation between the activity of PAK1/2/3 and the stage of human MPNSTs. We determined that reducing Group I Pak activity diminished MPNST cell proliferation and motility, and that these effects were not accompanied by significant blockade of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway, but rather by reductions in Akt and β-catenin activity. Using the small molecule PAK1/2/3 inhibitor Frax1036 and the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD0325901, we showed that the combination of these two agents synergistically inhibited MPNST cell growth in vitro and dramatically decreased local and metastatic MPNST growth in animal models. Taken together, these data provide new insights into MPNST signaling deregulation and suggest that co-targeting of PAK1/2/3 and MEK1/2 may be effective in the treatment of patients with MPNSTs."
https://openalex.org/W2619210033,"In prior studies, our laboratory showed that psychosine accumulates and disrupts lipid rafts in brain membranes of Krabbe’s disease. A model of lipid raft disruption helped explaining psychosine’s effects on several signaling pathways important for oligodendrocyte survival and differentiation but provided more limited insight in how this sphingolipid caused demyelination. Here, we have studied how this cationic inverted coned lipid affects the fluidity, stability and structure of myelin and plasma membranes. Using a combination of cutting-edge imaging techniques in non-myelinating (red blood cell), and myelinating (oligodendrocyte) cell models, we show that psychosine is sufficient to disrupt sphingomyelin-enriched domains, increases the rigidity of localized areas in the plasma membrane, and promotes the shedding of membranous microvesicles. The same physicochemical and structural changes were measured in myelin membranes purified from the mutant mouse Twitcher, a model for Krabbe’s disease. Areas of higher rigidity were measured in Twitcher myelin and correlated with higher levels of psychosine and of myelin microvesiculation. These results expand our previous analyses and support, for the first time a pathogenic mechanism where psychosine’s toxicity in Krabbe disease involves deregulation of cell signaling not only by disruption of membrane rafts, but also by direct local destabilization and fragmentation of the membrane through microvesiculation. This model of membrane disruption may be fundamental to introduce focal weak points in the myelin sheath, and consequent diffuse demyelination in this leukodystrophy, with possible commonality to other demyelinating disorders."

However, the role of LPI in secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a hormone that enhances glucose-induced insulin secretion, is unclear. Here, we used the murine enteroendocrine L cell line GLUTag and primary murine small intestinal cells to elucidate the mechanism of LPI-induced GLP-1 secretion. Exogenous LPI addition increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) in GLUTag cells and induced GLP-1 secretion from both GLUTag and acutely prepared primary intestinal cells. The [Ca2+]i increase was suppressed by an antagonist for G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) and by silencing of GPR55 expression, indicating involvement of Gq and G12/13 signaling pathways in the LPI-induced increased [Ca2+]i levels and GLP-1 secretion. However, GPR55 agonists did not mimic many of the effects of LPI. We also found that phospholipase C inhibitor and Rho-associated kinase inhibitor suppressed the [Ca2+]i increase and that LPI increased the number of focal adhesions, indicating actin reorganization. Of note, blockage or silencing of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 2 (TRPV2) channels suppressed both the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase and GLP-1 secretion. Furthermore, LPI accelerated TRPV2 translocation to the plasma membrane, which was significantly suppressed by a GPR55 antagonist. These findings suggest that TRPV2 activation via actin reorganization induced by Gq and G12/13 signaling is involved in LPI-stimulated GLP-1 secretion in enteroendocrine L cells.

Endocrinol. 2014; 383: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results suggest the involvement of LPI and GPR55 in glucose homeostasis. However, neither the role of LPI on the release of GLP-1 or the specific molecular mechanisms of LPI-induced hormone secretion from enteroendocrine L cells are largely unknown. In this study we used the enteroendocrine L cell line GLUTag to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of LPI-induced GLP-1 secretion. We found that GLUTag cells endogenously express GPR55. Application of LPI induced a significant increase in [Ca2+]i and GLP-1 secretion. GLP-1 secretion was also enhanced by LPI in primary intestinal cells from mice. Inhibition of GPR55 by an antagonist, silencing of GPR55 by a small interfering RNA (siRNA), and inhibition of the Gq and G12/13 pathways by a phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor and a Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor suppressed the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Furthermore, blockage and silencing of transient potential receptor cation channel subfamily V member 2 (TRPV2) also suppressed the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase and GLP-1 secretion. Interestingly, application of LPI to the cells induced the translocation of TRPV2 to the plasma membrane revealed by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. These results suggest that LPI induces GLP-1 secretion from enteroendocrine L cells through the activation of the GPR55, ROCK, and TRPV2 pathways. To examine the effect of LPI on GLP-1 secretion from enteroendocrine L cells, we first monitored intracellular Ca2+ dynamics using the Ca2+-sensing dye Fluo-4 AM in GLUTag cells. Application of LPI induced an [Ca2+]i increase with prolonged oscillatory responses, and the area under curve of fluorescence intensity of Fluo-4 was significantly increased (Fig. 1, A and B). 2 μm LPI was sufficient to significantly enhance GLP-1 secretion as determined by ELISA (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, application of 10 μm LPI significantly increased GLP-1 secretion in primary mouse small intestinal cells (Fig. 1D). To clarify the signaling cascades involved in the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase, we examined the contribution of GPR55, an LPI receptor. As determined by RT-PCR, GPR55 was expressed in GLUTag cells (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S1A). Co-application of the GPR55 antagonist O-1918 with LPI significantly reduced the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 2, B and C). Silencing of endogenous GPR55 expression using a specific siRNA also significantly suppressed the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 2, D and E, and supplemental Fig. S1B). These results suggest that GPR55 functions as a receptor through which LPI induces [Ca2+]i increase in enteroendocrine L cells. Because GPR55 is generally coupled to Gq or G12/13 proteins, we next examined the effect of the PLC inhibitor U-73122 and the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 to clarify the involvement of these pathways downstream of GPR55. Co-application of either U-73122 or Y-27632 with LPI significantly suppressed the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 3, A–D). These results suggest that both PLC- and RhoA-mediated signals are involved in the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase. Although we also examined the involvement of PI3K pathway using a PI3K inhibitor LY294002, co-application of LY294002 with LPI had little effect (Fig. 3, E and F). To investigate the role of RhoA-mediated signals in response to LPI, we analyzed subplasma membrane actin dynamics by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy using the actin visualizing fluorescent protein Lifeact-EGFP (31Riedl J. Crevenna A.H. Kessenbrock K. Yu J.H. Neukirchen D. Bista M. Bradke F. Jenne D. Holak T.A. Werb Z. Sixt M. Wedlich-Soldner R. Lifeact: a versatile marker to visualize F-actin.Nat. Methods. 2008; 5: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1517) Google Scholar). After the application of LPI, Lifeact-EGFP fluorescent fibers became thicker in the leading edge of the plasma membrane (Fig. 3G). Additionally, we found a significant increase in punctate fluorescent signals throughout the subplasma membrane. These signals were likely focal adhesions formed by RhoA GTPase (32Kiuchi T.

Cell Sci. 2014; 127: 1229-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3G, insets, and H). These results suggest that actin reorganization contributes to LPI-induced GLP-1 secretion through the Gq and G12/13 pathways. We explored additional signaling pathways that could contribute to [Ca2+]i increase. LPI induces [Ca2+]i increase in TRPV2-overexpressing HEK293 cells (16Monet M. Gkika D. Lehen'kyi V. Pourtier A. Vanden Abeele F. Bidaux G. Juvin V. Rassendren F. Humez S. Prevarsakaya N. Lysophospholipids stimulate prostate cancer cell migration via TRPV2 channel activation.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); therefore, we examined the involvement of TRPV2 in LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase in GLUTag cells. We confirmed expression of TRPV2 mRNA in GLUTag cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S1C). Co-application of the TRP channel blocker ruthenium red (RR) with LPI significantly suppressed the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase and GLP-1 secretion (Fig. 4, B–D). Ruthenium red used to inhibit TRPV2 activity in this study also inhibits many additional subtypes of TRP channels and is not specific for TRPV2 (34Vriens J. Appendino G. Nilius B. Pharmacology of vanilloid transient receptor potential cation channels.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 75: 1262-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next specifically silenced TRPV2 expression by siRNA. This treatment also significantly suppressed LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase and GLP-1 secretion (Fig. 4, E–G, and supplemental Fig. S1D). To understand the mechanism of TRPV2 activation underlying the [Ca2+]i increase, we monitored the localization of TRPV2 on the plasma membrane using TIRF microscopy. Application of LPI induced a gradual increase in the fluorescence intensity of TRPV2-EGFP throughout the entire plasma membrane (Fig. 5, A and B, and supplemental Movie S1). The increase in the fluorescence intensity of TRPV2-EGFP was significantly suppressed by co-application of O-1918 with LPI (Fig. 5C). These results suggest that LPI-induced TRPV2 translocation to the plasma membrane is involved in the [Ca2+]i increase and GLP-1 secretion. We next investigated whether selective activation of GPR55 recapitulates the LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase, TRPV2 translocation, and GLP-1 secretion. However, application of GPR55 agonist, O-1602, had little effect on [Ca2+]i, fluorescence intensity of TRPV2-EGFP, or GLP-1 secretion (Fig. 6). These results suggest that the [Ca2+]i increase and GLP-1 secretion is not evoked by simply activating GPR55. The focus of our research was to explore whether LPI induces GLP-1 secretion from enteroendocrine L cells and to clarify the precise signaling pathways downstream of LPI stimulation that contribute GLP-1 secretion. In this study we found that the enteroendocrine L cell line GLUTag exhibited a [Ca2+]i increase in response to LPI via the G protein-coupled receptor GPR55 (Figure 1, Figure 2). The EC50 of LPI estimated from Ca2+ imaging was 3.4 μm (supplemental Fig. 2A). Because the circulating level of LPI in rats is ∼3 μm (30Imbernon M. Whyte L. Diaz-Arteaga A. Russell W.R. Moreno N.R. Vazquez M.J. Gonzalez C.R. Díaz-Ruiz A. Lopez M. Malagón M.M. Ross R.A. Dieguez C. Nogueiras R. Regulation of GPR55 in rat white adipose tissue and serum LPI by nutritional status, gestation, gender, and pituitary factors.Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2014; 383: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), 2 μm LPI may be sufficient to induce GLP-1 secretion from enteroendocrine L cells under physiological conditions. In the presence of 2 μm LPI, ∼50–80% of observed cells showed a [Ca2+]i increase (data not shown). This phenomenon may be explained by different expression levels of GPR55, TRPV2, and Gq or G12/13 proteins. GPR55 is involved in the Gq, G12/13, and PI3K pathways (20Oka S. Nakajima K. Yamashita A.

Interestingly, inhibition of PLC or ROCK significantly suppressed the [Ca2+]i increase in GLUTag cells, whereas inhibition of PI3K had little effect (Fig. 3). The subfamily of heterotrimeric G proteins is heterogeneously distributed in various cells and tissues (35Gettys T.W. Ramkumar V. Surwit R.S. Taylor I.L.

Thus, these effects may be explained by the difference in expression levels and/or the functional switch between Gq and G12/13 proteins in GLUTag cells. Consistent with previous results (16Monet M.

Acta. 2009; 1793: 528-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), translocation of TRPV2 to the plasma membrane in response to LPI appears to be a key phenomenon to LPI-induced [Ca2+]i increase and GLP-1 secretion (Figure 4, Figure 5). Notably, inhibition or silencing of GPR55 suppressed the [Ca2+]i increase (Fig. 4, E–G), and translocation of TRPV2 was also GPR55-dependent (Fig. 5C), suggesting that TRPV2 translocation takes place in response to the activation of GPR55.

Carroll K.S. Peroxide-dependent sulfenylation of the EGFR catalytic site enhances kinase activity.Nat. Chem.

Mechanism of peroxide-inactivation of the sulphydryl enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 10: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Common targets of H2O2 are protein thiols, which it oxidizes to more reactive species, mainly sulfenic acids (-SOH). This transient posttranslational modification aids in the formation of inter- or intramolecular disulfide bonds, alters cellular signaling, and regulates enzymatic activity (25Anfinsen C.B. Haber E. Studies on the reduction and re-formation of protein disulfide bonds.J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 1361-1363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Devarie-Baez N.O. Silva Lopez E.I. Furdui C.M. Biological chemistry and functionality of protein sulfenic acids and related thiol modifications.Free Radic. Res. 2016; 50: 172-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we noted the stimulation of P450 4A11 activity by thiols and other reducing agents and further examined the ability of P450 4A11 to respond to perturbations in the redox environment in vitro. Ten other recombinant human P450s were tested for sensitivity to reductants, and no large changes in activity were noted. Five of the eight possible cysteine (to serine) mutants of P450 4A11 were expressed and were found to be catalytically active, reducing the possibilities for the sensitive thiol. We observed that P450 4A11 is sensitive to oxidation and, interestingly, sulfenic acid formation was able to disrupt binding of Cys-457 to the heme iron and inactivate the enzyme, in a very reversible process. We also detected sulfenylation of P450 4A11 and murine subfamily 4a/b P450 enzymes in kidneys and livers derived from CYP4A11 transgenic mice, suggesting that changes in the redox state of these enzymes might have relevance to the local production of 20-HETE. In previous work, the rates of ω-hydroxylation of lauric acid varied considerably, from 9 to 21 min−1, under varying conditions (4Kim D. Cha G.S. Nagy L.D. Yun C.-H. Guengerich F.P. Kinetic analysis of lauric acid hydroxylation by human cytochrome P450 4A11.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 6161-6172Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When P450 4A11 was pretreated with either DTT or tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) reagents in our preliminary experiments (Fig. 1), ω-hydroxylation activity was routinely increased 2–4-fold. Similar results were found with reduced glutathione (results not shown). The ratio of the two major products, 11- and 12-hydroxylauric acid, remained constant with this activation (results not shown). These results indicated that P450 4A11 has a thiol-dependent redox sensitivity, which was investigated further. Redox-dependent activation was also reflected in the increase in kcat values for both the wild-type and F434S (rs1126742) (8Gainer J.V. Bellamine A. Dawson E.P. Womble K.E. Grant S.W. Wang Y.

The Km values with and without DTT remained constant between the wild-type enzyme (63 ± 10 and 62 ± 15 μm, respectively) and the F434S variant (67 ± 7 and 58 ± 10 μm, respectively) (Fig. 2, A and B). Collectively, these results indicate that both wild-type and F434S variant P450 4A11 are activated in a reducing environment, which may have biological relevance in vivo.Figure 2Stimulation of lauric acid ω-hydroxylation activity by DTT.

The redox sensitivity of P450 4A11 was unique among human P450 enzymes examined here.Table 1Effects of DTT on catalytic activities of P450 4A11 and other human P450sHuman P450SubstrateReactionCatalytic activityChange−DTT+DTT (1 mm)nmol product/min/nmol P450%4A11Lauric acid12-OH9.0 ± 1.138 ± 1+3202C8Paclitaxel6-OH1.8 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.1+72C9Tolbutamide1′-OH1.1 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.2+332D6Bufuralol4′-OH2.9 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.1+93A4NifedipineDesaturation2.0 ± 0.61.8 ± 0.5−1019A1TestosteroneEstrone formation10.8 ± 0.210.9 ± 0.9+121A2Progesterone21-OH51 ± 1068 ± 6+302A6Coumarin6-OHNCaNC, assayed using fluorescence methods, but absolute amounts of product not calibrated.NC−141A1Ethoxyresorufin(Resorufin)NCNC+81A2Ethoxyresorufin(Resorufin)NCNC+261B1Ethoxyresorufin(Resorufin)NCNC−4a NC, assayed using fluorescence methods, but absolute amounts of product not calibrated. Open table in a new tab P450 4A11 hydroxylation activity was inhibited by H2O2. This inhibition occurred in a time-dependent manner with an 80% loss in activity occurring within 15 min (Fig. 3), a rate much higher than reported for uncatalyzed sulfenylation of thiols (27Winterbourn C.C. Hampton M.B. Thiol chemistry and specificity in redox signaling.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2008; 45: 549-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). Fifty percent activity loss occurred at a concentration of 140 μm H2O2 (Fig. 4).Figure 4Loss of P450 4A11 lauric acid ω-hydroxylation activity as a function of H2O2. P450 4A11 (500 nm) was incubated with varying concentrations of H2O2 for 15 min at 37 °C in oxidation buffer (pH 8.0). Catalase (10 units ml−1) was added to quench the residual H2O2 (for 10 min at 25 °C), and the remaining P450 4A11 was reconstituted and used to measure lauric acid ω-hydroxylation activity.

Cys-457 corresponds to the proximal heme ligand and could not be changed (28Poulos T.L. Johnson E.F. Structures of cytochrome P450 enzymes.in: Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

The carbon monoxide-binding pigment of liver microsomes. I. Evidence for its hemoprotein nature.J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Steady-state kinetic assays were done with the remaining five cysteine mutants, both with and without DTT pretreatment (Fig. 5). The response to DTT was qualitatively the same as that of the wild-type P450 4A11 (Fig. 2A), except for C200S (Fig. 5C) and possibly C513S (Fig. 5, A and E), but these analyses did not implicate any of these five cysteines as being involved in the modulation of hydroxylation activity observed in the wild-type enzyme. The major conclusion was that none of these five cysteines are critical to the normal activity of P450 450 4A11, leaving only the non-mutated Cys-347, Cys-375, and Cys-457 as candidates for the oxidation-reduction phenomenon. A portion of oxidized P450 4A11 treated with each of several different concentrations of H2O2 was treated with d6-dimedone (co-incubation) and subsequently counter-alkylated with (d0-)iododimedone (30Seo Y.H.

The alkylated protein was digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 7); integrated areas of extracted ion chromatograms for the heavy (sulfenic acid-modified) and light (free thiol) were compared using the program Skyline (31Schilling B.

Sulfenylation of (the heme–thiolate ligand) Cys-457 coincided with the attenuation of enzymatic activity observed with increasing concentrations of H2O2 (Fig. 8 and supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). Oxidation of the heme–thiolate ligand would lead to an inability of the heme iron to effectively activate oxygen and carry out catalysis.Figure 7Peptide analysis.

An isotope-coded affinity tagging (ICAT) approach was developed using d5/d0-iodoacetanilide (32Kurono S. Kurono T. Komori N. Niwayama S. Matsumoto H. Quantitative proteome analysis using d-labeled N-ethylmaleimide and 13C-labeled iodoacetanilide by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Bioorg. Med.

Lett. 2008; 18: 4891-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). Briefly, samples were treated with varying concentrations of H2O2, and thiols were then trapped using trichloroacetic acid precipitation (34Lin T.Y. Kim P.S. Urea dependence of thiol-disulfide equilibria in thioredoxin: confirmation of the linkage relationship and a sensitive assay for structure.Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5282-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Protein was then pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended, and treated with d5-iodoacetanilide to alkylate free thiols (35Gupta V. Carroll K.S. Sulfenic acid chemistry, detection and cellular lifetime.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 1840: 847-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The protein was then precipitated and resuspended in reducing buffer to reduce disulfide bonds (and any unreacted sulfenic acids) and alkylated with d0-iodoacetanilide. Tryptic peptides were analyzed via LC-MS/MS, and the area ratios of alkylated deuterated/non-deuterated thiol-containing peptides were analyzed. This experiment showed no differences in ratios between a reduced P450 4A11 protein control and up to 1 mm H2O2 (supplemental Fig. S2). Seven of the eight cysteines in P450 4A11 maintained at least 60% reduction (i.e. > 60% d0 labeling) with only Cys-513, the carboxyl-terminal cysteine, being oxidized further with increasing H2O2. Spectral properties of P450 4A11 were used to further address the proteomic results (i.e. to address the hypothesis that the sulfenic acid moiety disrupts the iron coordination of the heme). TCEP-treated P450 4A11 was treated with H2O2, reconstituted with NADPH-P450 reductase, deaerated, and placed under an anaerobic atmosphere of CO. Following the addition of NADPH, spectra were recorded for TCEP-reduced (Fig. 9A) and H2O2-oxidized (Fig. 9B) P450 4A11. The H2O2-oxidized protein showed increased absorbance at 420 nm for the CO-bound form. Sodium dithionite was added to these samples, which increased the absorbance of the oxidized enzyme at 450 nm and decreased the absorbance at 420 nm. NADPH-P450 reductase is able to reduce ferric heme to the ferrous state (allowing CO binding) but cannot reduce the sulfenic acid, leading to an inactive protein due to the loss of the thiolate axial coordination. However, dithionite is able to reduce a sulfenic acid (36Parsonage D. Claiborne A. Analysis of the kinetic and redox properties of NADH peroxidase C42S and C42A mutants lacking the cysteine-sulfenic acid redox center.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), allowing for the reduced thiolate to re-ligand with the heme–iron (Fig. 10). The change in A450 upon the addition of dithionite in Fig. 9B corresponds to an increase of ∼0.3 μm P450 (∼30% total, uncorrected for loss of P450 in the degassing procedure), somewhat less than predicted from the LC-MS labeling study (Fig. 8).Figure 10Scheme of Cys-457 sulfenic acid formation and reduction in P450 4A11. In the presence of H2O2, the heme–thiolate ligand becomes oxidized and loses its coordination with the heme iron. The sulfenic acid is not reduced by NADPH-P450 reductase but can be reduced by dithionite, reforming the heme coordination.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether this oxidative modification of P450 4A11 occurs in vivo, a CYP4A11 transgenic mouse model was used (20Savas U. Machemer D.E. Hsu M.H. Gaynor P. Lasker J.M. Tukey R.H. Johnson E.F. Opposing roles of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α and growth hormone in the regulation of CYP4A11 expression in a transgenic mouse model.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 16541-16552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Liver and kidney tissues from four male mice were harvested, and subcellular fractionation was done immediately. Microsomes were obtained within 3 h of tissue harvesting via differential centrifugation and, as with the recombinant protein, incubated with either buffer, d6-dimedone, or d6-dimedone supplemented with 500 μm H2O2 (Fig. 6). These labeled samples were then treated with catalase, reduced, counter-alkylated with (d0-)iododimedone, and digested with chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin was used to produce peptides containing the heme–ligand cysteine unique to both P450s 4A11 and 4a12 in kidneys of male mice (supplemental Fig. S3) (37Muller D.N. Schmidt C. Barbosa-Sicard E. Wellner M. Gross V. Hercule H. Markovic M. Honeck H. Luft F.C. Schunck W.H.

J. 2007; 403: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The microsomal chymotryptic peptides were analyzed via LC-MS/MS, and the resulting peak area ratios were quantitated. The heme–thiolate Cys-457 of P450 4A11 showed ∼75% dimedone labeling (sulfenylation) in both the dimedone and H2O2-supplemented samples in the kidney microsomes of three mice and ∼40% labeling in the liver microsomes (Fig. 11 (A and B) and supplemental Fig. S4). One mouse was considerably younger (age of 6 weeks at time of harvest) than the other three (two of which were 3 months old and one of which was 7 months old), and the expression of P450 4A11 was greatly diminished compared with that in the older mice, as judged by peptide recovery. Interestingly, murine P450s 4a12 (Fig. 11 (C and D) and supplemental Fig. S5) and 4b1 (Fig. 11E and supplemental Fig. S6) also showed significant sulfenylation of the respective heme–thiol ligands. The younger mouse had consistently lower levels of sulfenylation of the heme-binding peptide for all of the family 4 P450s in the kidneys and lower levels of P450 4a12 in the liver, but the sulfenylation of P450 4A11 in the liver was not different from that of the older mice. We have shown that H2O2 reacts with the heme–thiolate cysteine of P450 4A11 to form a sulfenic acid and disrupt the iron-sulfur coordination. Five of the eight Cys residues in the protein were shown not to be essential for activity (Fig. 5), and the heme-proximal ligand Cys-457 was identified as the major site of oxidation by modification and proteomic analysis (Figure 7, Figure 8). It is well-established that breaking this bond will also convert P450 to an inactive form, cytochrome P420 (38Omura T. Sato R. The carbon monoxide-binding pigment of liver microsomes. II.

Schistosomes, commonly known as blood flukes, infected 261 million people in 78 countries in 2013 with up to 200,000 deaths caused by the associated disease (1World Health Organization (2015) http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs115/enGoogle Scholar). The parasite is acquired from freshwater snail hosts found in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, South America, and the West Indies. Schistosomiasis, the chronic illness resulting from schistosome infection, is classified by the World Health Organization as a neglected tropical disease. Three species of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma hematobium, and Schistosoma japonicum, account for almost all cases of human schistosomiasis (2Hotez P.J. Bundy D.A.P.

Symptoms vary according to the infecting species, and chronic infection can damage the liver, spleen, lungs, intestines, and urogenital tract (3Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2012) http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasisGoogle Scholar). Effective drug treatment is available using the drug praziquantel, currently the recommended drug for schistosome infection. Praziquantel intervention provides enormous health benefits, but the selective pressure the monotherapy applies to the parasite has the potential to drive resistance to the drug. Schistosomes with decreased susceptibility to praziquantel have already been documented in patients in Egypt, Senegal, and Tanzania (4Greenberg R.M. New approaches for understanding mechanisms of drug resistance in schistosomes.Parasitology. 2013; 140: 1534-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar); therefore, combination treatments are needed. Oxamniquine was the first-line antischistosomal drug in Brazil until the 1980s when it was gradually replaced by praziquantel (5Beck L. Favre T.C. Pieri O.S. Zani L.C. Domas G.G. Barbosa C.S.

Initial efforts to express full-length recombinant ShSULT were unsuccessful. Examination of the sequences of the three schistosome enzymes showed that ShSULT contains an additional N-terminal extension of 15 residues compared with SmSULT and SjSULT. Engineering this extension out of the ShSULT expression construct yielded a soluble protein amenable to crystallization. Although this modified ShSULT could be expressed using a construct containing a cleavable N-terminal His8 tag, little soluble protein was produced from N-terminally tagged constructs for SjSULT, and refolded protein failed to crystallize. The addition of a short Gly-Ser linker plus a C-terminal His8 tag to full-length SjSULT produced soluble protein that formed crystals. For both enzymes, the crystals were grown in the presence of PAP, yielding the structures of the enzyme–PAP complexes. Soaking the ShSULT crystals with racemic oxamniquine or the individual stereoisomers yielded the structures of the enzyme–PAP–oxamniquine complexes (Fig. 1 and Table 1).Table 1Data collection and refinement statisticsShSULT–PAPShSULT–PAP–racemic OXAShSULT–PAP–(R)-OXAShSULT–PAP–(S)-OXASjSULT–PAPPDB code5TIV5TIW5TIX5TIY5TIZData collectionX-ray SourceAdvanced Photon Source 24-ID-EAdvanced Photon Source 24-ID-CUTHSCSA X-ray Crystallography Core LaboratoryUTHSCSA X-ray Crystallography Core LaboratoryAdvanced Photon Source 24-ID-ESpace groupC2221P21212P212121C2221P4122Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)52.6, 73.6, 139.669.7, 139.4, 49.651.7, 72.6, 138.752.5, 73.4, 139.057.3, 57.3, 181.5α, β, γ (°)90, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 9090, 90, 90Wavelength (Å)0.97920.97951.541781.541780.9792Resolution (Å)139.6–1.43 (1.51–1.43)aHighest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.139.42–1.66 (1.75–1.66)46.23–1.78 (1.88–1.78)46.34–1.76 (1.86–1.76)54.65–2.87 (3.03–2.87)Rsym0.055 (0.901)0.056 (0.914)0.086 (0.645)0.055 (0.714)0.158 (0.667)Rpim0.025 (0.395)0.024 (0.382)0.045 (0.329)0.028 (0.376)0.115 (0.493)Mean I/σI18.3 (2.0)21.9 (2.1)13.9 (2.0)15.5 (2.0)7.7 (2.0)Completeness (%)99.7 (100)99.8 (99.9)99.2 (98.4)99.6 (100)96.9 (98.8)Redundancy7.0 (7.2)7.2 (7.4)4.5 (4.6)4.6 (4.6)2.8 (2.8)Wilson value (Å2)17.626.522.927.339.0RefinementResolution (Å)36.48–1.4369.71–1.6639.00–1.7840.84–1.7654.65–2.87No. reflections50,23457,77350,28626,8387,107Rwork/Rfree0.159/0.1910.175/0.2030.188/0.2300.167/0.2140.225/0.276No. atoms Protein2,0734,0924,0482,0362,059 Ligand/ion35 (1 PAP, 1 TRS)bLigand abbreviations: OXA, oxamniquine; BCN, Bicine (N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine); TRS, Tris buffer.140 (2 PAP, 2 (S)-OXA, 5 Ca2+, 1 PEG, 1BCN)94 (2 PAP, 2 (R)-OXA)47 (1 PAP, 1 (S)-OXA)27 (1 PAP) Solvent240290433184B-factors (Å2) Protein22.529.828.632.331.5 Ligand18.533.531.730.016.8 Solvent33.037.538.640.6r.m.s.d. bond lengths (Å)0.0080.0130.0030.0040.010r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)1.0031.1930.6080.6900.848Ramachandran statistics: favored, allowed, outliers (%)96.4, 3.6, 0.097.6, 2.4, 0.096.7, 3.3, 0.097.2, 2.8, 0.095.6, 4.0, 0.4a Highest resolution shell is shown in parentheses.b Ligand abbreviations: OXA, oxamniquine; BCN, Bicine (N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine); TRS, Tris buffer. Open table in a new tab The overall structures of both ShSULT and SjSULT are similar to that of SmSULT (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 4MUA). The ShSULT molecule superimposes onto SmSULT with an r.m.s.d. of 0.8 Å over 243 of 253 residues with no significant deviations other than a fully ordered loop (ShSULT residues 76–80) in the α3-loop-α4 region that is disordered in the SmSULT crystal structure. The N-terminal 17–20 residues are disordered. The SjSULT molecule superimposes onto SmSULT with an r.m.s.d. of 1.0 Å over 232 of 253 residues with one significant deviation in a C-terminal α helix (α12) caused by its domain swap into a neighboring molecule related by 2-fold crystal symmetry. The swapped α12 does not superimpose on the C-terminal α helices of SmSULT or ShSULT associated with α11 in a helix-turn-helix motif. Rather, SjSULT α12 is displaced and packs against α2 (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B) with half of the C-terminal tag (Gly-Ser-His-His-His) visible in the electron density map. The tag region makes van der Waals interactions with the protein surface formed by α1-β1-α2 secondary structures. We speculate that this arrangement is an artifact caused by the domain swap. Threading the SjSULT C-terminal sequence onto the C-terminal structure of either SmSULT or ShSULT reveals that the SjSULT sequence is compatible with the ShSULT fold (supplemental Fig. 1C) provided small adjustments are made such as selecting common rotamers. All three schistosome SULTs adopt an α/β fold characteristic to the PAPS-dependent SULT family of enzymes with a five-stranded parallel β sheet sandwiched between two clusters of five and seven α helices.

Fig. 2A presents a secondary structure topology diagram of the schistosome SULT fold indicating elements in common with the mammalian SULTs. Schistosome SULTs have an additional three α helices in common with TPST2 that are absent from the well characterized canonical mammalian SULTs in the SULT1, SULT2, and SULT4 families with known structures. Five α helices in the schistosome SULT do not have a mammalian enzyme counterpart (Fig. 2, A–C). The PAPS-binding site in the schistosome SULTs is almost identical to that seen in other members of the PAPS-dependent SULT family (14Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M. Pedersen L.C.

A conserved arginine residue in the β1-loop-α1 bridges the 3′- and 5′-phosphates of PAP, whereas a conserved serine residue in the same loop forms a hydrogen bond to N7 of the adenine (Fig. 3A). Separate conserved arginine and serine residues from the β4-loop-α6 interact with the negative charge of the 3′-phosphate. The lysine residue that forms a hydrogen bond with a sulfate oxygen in PAPS in mammalian SULTs is replaced by a histidine in all three schistosome enzymes (Table 2 and Fig. 3, A and B).Table 2Structurally equivalent active site residues in schistosomal and mammalian SULTsTPST2SULT1E1SmSULTShSULTSjSULTArg-78Lys-47Arg-17Arg-32Arg-17Thr-81Thr-50Thr-20Thr-35Thr-20Glu-99His-107Asp-91Asp-100Asp-87Lys-158Lys-105His-37His-52His-37Ser-191Ser-137Ser-123Ser-132Ser-119Arg-183Arg-129Arg-115Arg-124Arg-111Ser-285Asn-228Asn-237Asn-224 Open table in a new tab To investigate the interaction of oxamniquine with ShSULT, the ShSULT–PAP crystals were soaked overnight with the individual stereoisomers or racemic oxamniquine. Difference electron density maps (Fo − Fc) clearly indicated the presence of oxamniquine in the predicted substrate-binding region in all cases. In the crystals soaked with (S)-oxamniquine, the drug is in a similar position to that seen in the SmSULT–PAP–(S)-oxamniquine complex (PDB code 5BYK) (Fig. 4A). ShSULT Asp-100 accepts a hydrogen bond from the putative reactive hydroxyl group. Ser-166 donates a hydrogen bond to the nitro group, and Asp-153 accepts a hydrogen bond from the amine in the isopropylaminomethyl group of oxamniquine. In the crystals soaked with the (R)-oxamniquine, the drug is in a position that can be described as a possibly unproductive binding mode. It is oriented similarly along the longest axis of the molecule when compared with (S)-oxamniquine, but its hydroxyl group is not in hydrogen-bonding distance to Asp-100. Rather, an intervening solvent molecule is positioned in hydrogen-bonding distance to both Asp-100 and the oxamniquine hydroxyl group (Fig. 4B). In both complexes, the pucker of the oxamniquine piperidine ring differs from that seen in SmSULT. In the (S)-oxamniquine and (R)-oxamniquine complexes of ShSULT, carbon 3 is on the same side of the piperidine plane as the isopropylaminomethyl group. In both complexes of SmSULT, carbon 3 is on the opposite side of the plane (supplemental Fig. 2). Oxamniquine is a racemic mixture in the formulation given as treatment to patients, although the S-stereoisomer has higher potency against S. mansoni in vivo (16Taylor A.B. Pica-Mattoccia L. Polcaro C.M. Donati E. Cao X. Basso A. Guidi A. Rugel A.R. Holloway S.P. Anderson T.J. Hart P.J. Cioli D. LoVerde P.T. Structural and functional characterization of the enantiomers of the antischistosomal drug oxamniquine.PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 2015; 9: e0004132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). When racemic oxamniquine is soaked into crystals of SmSULT, the active site contains only the S-isomer. The ShSULT–PAP–racemic oxamniquine complex contains two molecules per asymmetric unit that superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 0.5 Å. The active sites in both chains superimpose closely with the exceptions of Tyr-54, Ser-166, and the oxamniquine molecule. In chain B, both Tyr-54 and Ser-166 have similar positions to those of their counterparts in SmSULT, Phe-39 and Thr-157 (Fig. 5A). Oxamniquine also binds in a position similar to that seen in SmSULT, and the electron density clearly shows that only (S)-oxamniquine is bound in ShSULT. In chain A, Tyr-54, Ser-166, and oxamniquine are in two conformations (Fig. 5B), and all refine to nearly 0.5 occupancy. For Tyr-54, one position is shifted away from the central cavity, and the other matches the single position adopted in chain B. One position of the side chain of Ser-166 matches its position in chain B, allowing formation of a hydrogen bond with the nitro moiety of oxamniquine. In the other position, the side chain is rotated so that the hydroxyl faces away from the oxamniquine molecule. For oxamniquine, one conformation matches the position of oxamniquine observed in chain B and in the crystal structure of ShSULT complexed with pure (S)-oxamniquine, but the other conformation is slightly rotated around an axis perpendicular to the piperidine plane. To summarize, in chain A, Tyr-54 positioned “in” toward the substrate pocket with the Ser-166 Oγ positioned “out” mimics the S. mansoni-like oxamniquine position, whereas Tyr-54 out and Ser-166 in promote an alternate oxamniquine position. Comparison with the ShSULT–PAP–(R)-oxamniquine and ShSULT–PAP–(S)-oxamniquine structures suggests that both oxamniquine conformations seen in chain A contain only (S)-oxamniquine. The electron density does not support modeling an (R)-oxamniquine as one of the two conformations depicted in Fig. 5B. The specific activities of all three recombinant enzymes were determined using the common sulfotransferase substrate quercetin (17Pica-Mattoccia L. Carlini D. Guidi A. Cimica V. Vigorosi F. Cioli D. The schistosome enzyme that activates oxamniquine has the characteristics of a sulfotransferase.Mem. Inst. Oswaldo Cruz. 2006; 101: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). With this flavanol, SmSULT and SjSULT have similar specific activities, whereas ShSULT has a higher specific activity by a factor of 0.3 (Table 3). Alanine substitutions of the putative catalytic base in SmSULT (D91A) or ShSULT (D100A) decrease the activity of the enzymes 5- and 11-fold compared with the wild-type enzymes, respectively.Table 3Activities of schistosomal SULTs with quercetin as substrateEnzymeSpecific activitymmol product/mmol enzyme/minWild-type SmSULT3.5 ± 0.4D91A SmSULT0.71 ± 0.11Wild-type ShSULT4.6 ± 0.4D100A ShSULT0.41 ± 0.01Wild-type SjSULT3.5 ± 0.08 Open table in a new tab To determine which oxamniquine stereoisomer is preferred by each of the enzymes, kcat/Km values were determined.

This precluded determining reliable kcat and Km values for these two enzymes. For SmSULT, the highest activity with racemic oxamniquine of 9 min−1 was at 6–7 μm; ShSULT had the highest activity with racemic oxamniquine, 16 min−1, at ∼60 μm; the kcat and Km values for SjSULT with the racemic substrate were 1.2 ± 0.2 min−1 and 50 ± 19 μm. It was still possible to determine kcat/Km values in all cases by determining initial rates at low concentrations of each stereoisomer of oxamniquine (Table 4). The results show significant differences among the abilities of the three enzymes to utilize the two isomers of oxamniquine as substrates. SmSULT does not show a significant preference for either stereoisomer. In contrast, (S)-oxamniquine is a better substrate by an order of magnitude for ShSULT, whereas SjSULT shows about a 3-fold preference for (R)-oxamniquine.Table 4Steady-state kinetic parameters for schistosomal SULTs with oxamniquine (OXA) as substrateEnzymekcat/Km(S)-OXA(R)-OXAμm−1 min−1SmSULT1.7 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.3ShSULT0.89 ± 0.220.067 ± 0.008SjSULT0.0071 ± 0.00160.021 ± 0.004 Open table in a new tab The sulfated product of the SULT reaction with oxamniquine is proposed to rapidly eliminate sulfate to form a highly reactive ethylene moiety (17Pica-Mattoccia L.

Ther. 1995; 68: 35-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Continuous-flow mass spectrometry was used to identify the product of the SULT reaction. Recombinant SmSULT in a volatile buffer was mixed with a solution containing PAPS and oxamniquine, and the mixture was injected into an OrbiTrap mass spectrometer. After a reaction of 6 s, the resulting mass spectrum showed a clear signal at m/z 280.1658 that corresponds to the [M + H]+ ion of oxamniquine (C14H22N3O3) (Fig. 6A). A smaller signal (1) was also detectable at m/z 382.1043. This mass is consistent with the formula C14H21N3O6SNa (predicted m/z, 382.1049) and can thus be identified as a sulfated oxamniquine with an associated sodium ion. This ion was not detectable when PAPS or enzyme was omitted from the reaction or when the D91A mutant enzyme was used in a complete reaction (Fig. 6B). The same ion was produced in reactions with recombinant ShSULT (Fig. 6C). Thus, the enzymes from both sources are able to catalyze the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to oxamniquine to produce a sulfated product. No ion corresponding to the proposed ethylene product was detected. The mass spectra from the reactions of both enzymes also show a major species (2) with m/z 322.2240; expansion of the spectra shows that a second smaller ion (3) with m/z 322.1762 is also produced by both enzymes. Neither ion is formed by the inactive mutant enzyme, establishing that they are products of the SULT reaction. The m/z values of the two ions correspond to ions with the formulae C16H28N5O2 (predicted m/z, 322.2238) and C16H24N3O4 (predicted m/z, 322.1761), respectively. The formation of both 2 and 3 was time-dependent with the ion intensities being 2–3-fold greater at 6 s than at 1.2 s (supplemental Table 1). The formation of 2 can be attributed to nucleophilic displacement of the sulfate from oxamniquine sulfate by ethanediamine in the buffer (Fig. 6E), whereas 3 can be attributed to similar displacement of the sulfate by acetate. Consistent with this proposal, if the SmSULT reaction was carried out in ammonium acetate buffer without ethanediamine, 2 was not detectable, and significantly more oxamniquine sulfate was formed (Fig. 6D). If the ethanediamine was replaced with Tris as buffer at pH 7.0, 2 was similarly not detectable, but a new peak with m/z 383.2291 was seen, and the amount of oxamniquine sulfate increased, consistent with nucleophilic displacement of sulfate from oxamniquine sulfate by Tris (predicted m/z, 383.2289). The SULTs from the three main species responsible for almost all human blood fluke infections have the hallmark characteristics of PAPS-dependent SULTs, including the β strand-loop-α helix PAPS-binding motif. Structurally, the schistosome enzymes are closer to the membrane-bound mammalian tyrosine protein sulfotransferases such as TPST2 than to cytosolic mammalian sulfotransferases such as SULTE1 (Table 2), although they lack obvious sequences for membrane binding. The schistosome SULTs contain five α helices without a counterpart in mammalian SULT structures; these helices enclose the active site and are likely to be important to the specificity of the schistosome enzymes. The enclosed active sites of the schistosome enzymes would be expected to prevent access of residues on protein surfaces in the absence of significant conformational changes, suggesting that the schistosome enzymes sulfate small molecule substrates. The oxamniquine-binding sites of all three schistosome enzymes are located within cavities surrounded by α helices 2, 6, 7, 8, 11, and 12. The cavities have the capacity to accommodate substrates of various sizes considering the internal volumes of 984, 985, and 1189 Å3 for SmSULT, ShSULT, and SjSULT, respectively (note that the cavity volume for SjSULT is based on the arrangement of the domain-swapped C-terminal helix, α12, in the crystal structure). For comparison, the calculated molecular volume of oxamniquine is 212 Å3. The active sites of the schistosome enzymes are consistent with their utilizing a different set of substrates from the mammalian enzymes (Figure 2, Figure 3). The mammalian SULTs have structural elements that would appear to impede productive oxamniquine binding (supplemental Fig. 3), suggesting that oxamniquine is not a substrate. Indeed, a study of metabolism of oxamniquine in several mammals, including humans, showed that the major metabolite excreted in urine has a carboxylate substitution for the hydroxymethyl group, consistent with metabolism by a cytochrome P450 rather than a SULT (23Kaye B. Woolhouse N.M. The metabolism of oxamniquine—a new schistosomicide.Ann. Trop. Med. Parasitol. 1976; 70: 323-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the selective toxicity of oxamniquine toward S. mansoni and not humans is likely attributable to the structural variation between the SULT homologs and the availability of an alternative detoxification pathway in humans. The mechanism of SULTs is proposed to involve nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated substrate hydroxyl group on the sulfur of PAPS, resulting in sulfuryl transfer from PAPS to the substrate (13Teramoto T.

Children have the ability to carefully reflect on this subject and enjoy participating in family discussions about it. Therefore, what children need is proper information. When schools are used to educate children about this subject, information about teacher support for this type of lesson along with its effects on the depth of family discussions is important.A questionnaire was sent to all 7,542 primary schools in the Netherlands. The goal was to gather information on teachers' perspectives about a neutral lesson devoted to organ and tissue donation, and also on the best age to start giving such a lesson. The second part of our study examined the effects of a newly developed lesson among 269 primary school pupils. The school response was 23%. Of these, 70% were positive towards a lesson; best age to start was 10-11 years. Pupils reported 20% more family discussions after school education and enjoyed learning more about this topic.

(Gaertn.)] is widely used for early spring grazing in western Canada and the development of late maturing cultivars which maintain forage quality for a longer period is desired. However, it is difficult to manipulate the timing of floral transition, as little is known about molecular mechanism of plant maturity in this species. In this study, RNA-Seq and differential gene expression analysis were performed to investigate gene expression for floral initiation and development in crested wheatgrass. Three cDNA libraries were generated and sequenced to represent three successive growth stages by sampling leaves at the stem elongation stage, spikes at boot and anthesis stages. The sequencing generated 25,568,846; 25,144,688 and 25,714,194 qualified Illumina reads for the three successive stages, respectively. De novo assembly of all the reads generated 311,671 transcripts with a mean length of 487 bp, and 152,849 genes with an average sequence length of 669 bp. A total of 48,574 (31.8%) and 105,222 (68.8%) genes were annotated in the Swiss-Prot and NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein databases, respectively. Based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathway database, 9,723 annotated sequences were mapped onto 298 pathways, including plant circadian clock pathway. Specifically, 113 flowering time-associated genes, 123 MADS-box genes and 22 CONSTANS-LIKE (COL) genes were identified. A COL homolog DN52048-c0-g4 which was clustered with the flowering time genes AtCO and OsHd1 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.), respectively, showed specific expression in leaves and could be a CONSTANS (CO) candidate gene. Taken together, this study has generated a new set of genomic resources for identifying and characterizing genes and pathways involved in floral transition and development in crested wheatgrass. These findings are significant for further understanding of the molecular basis for late maturity in this grass species."

Disruption of RUNX1 activity has been implicated in the development of hematopoietic neoplasms.

However, the precise mechanisms of RUNX1 ubiquitination have not been fully understood. Furthermore, much less is known about the mechanisms to regulate the stability of RUNX1–RUNX1T1. In this study, we identified several RUNX1-interacting E3 ubiquitin ligases using a novel high-throughput binding assay. Among them, we found that STUB1 bound to RUNX1 and induced its ubiquitination and degradation mainly in the nucleus. Immunofluorescence analyses revealed that the STUB1-induced ubiquitination also promoted nuclear export of RUNX1, which probably contributes to the reduced transcriptional activity of RUNX1 in STUB1-overexpressing cells. STUB1 also induced ubiquitination of RUNX1–RUNX1T1 and down-regulated its expression. Importantly, STUB1 overexpression showed a substantial growth-inhibitory effect in myeloid leukemia cells that harbor RUNX1–RUNX1T1, whereas it showed only a marginal effect in other non-RUNX1–RUNX1T1 leukemia cells and normal human cord blood cells.

It is used to treat hyperuricemia and gout, and also in a diagnostic kit. In this study, error-prone polymerase chain reaction and staggered extension process was used to generate a mutant urate oxidase with improved enzyme activity from Bacillus subtilis. After several rounds of mutagenesis and screening, two mutants 6E9 and 8E279 were obtained which exhibited 2.99 and 3.43 times higher catalytic efficiency, respectively. They also exhibited lower optimal reaction temperature and higher thermo-stability. D44V, Q268R and K285Q were identified as the three most beneficial amino acid substitutions introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. D44V/Q268R, which was obtained through random combination of the three mutants, displayed the highest catalytic activity. The Km, kcat/Km and enzyme activity of D44V/Q268R increased by 68%, 83% and 129% respectively, compared with that of wild-type urate oxidase. Structural modeling indicated that mutations far from the active site can have significant effects on activity. For many of them, the underlying mechanisms are still difficult to explain from the static structural model. We also compared the effects of the same set of single point mutations on the wild type and on the final mutant. The results indicate strong effects of epistasis, which may imply that the mutations affect catalysis through influences on protein dynamics besides equilibrium structures."

The selective β3-adrenergic agonist, CL316243 (1 mg/kg/d, i.p.) caused a greater increase in metabolic rate in EP4-knockout mice. CL316243 fragmented the unilocular lipid droplet into multilocular lipid vacuoles and increased mitochondrial biogenesis and its activity. These changes were amplified in mice with EP4 deficiency and were selectively seen in subcutaneous WAT. The expression of fat-specific protein (FSP)-27, a protein that promotes fusion of triglycerides and formation of unilocular lipid droplets were diminished, whereas the expression of phosphorylated AMPK, the upstream regulator of FSP27, was enhanced in EP4-deficient mice. The present study showed that EP4 acts as a negative regulator of WAT remodeling, it tightly coordinates rates of triglyceride storage in lipid droplets and mitochondrial respiratory function in subcutaneous white adipocytes through the phosphorylated AMPK-FSP27 signaling axis. Thus, deletion of EP4 increases mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative capacity in WAT, and fat mass loss ensues in mice.-Ying, F., Cai, Y., Cai, Y., Wang, Y., Tang, E. H. C.

https://openalex.org/W2618496634,"The two PKC orthologs Pck1 and Pck2 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe operate in a redundant fashion to control essential functions, including morphogenesis and cell wall biosynthesis, as well as the activity of the cell integrity pathway and its core element, the MAPK Pmk1. We show here that, despite the strong structural similarity and functional redundancy of these two enzymes, the mechanisms regulating their maturation, activation, and stabilization have a remarkably distinct biological impact on both kinases. We found that, in contrast to Pck2, putative in vivo phosphorylation of Pck1 within the conserved activation loop, turn, and hydrophobic motifs is essential for Pck1 stability and biological functions. Constitutive Pck activation promoted dephosphorylation and destabilization of Pck2, whereas it enhanced Pck1 levels to interfere with proper downstream signaling to the cell integrity pathway via Pck2. Importantly, although catalytic activity was essential for Pck1 function, Pck2 remained partially functional independent of its catalytic activity. Our findings suggest that early divergence from a common ancestor in fission yeast involved important changes in the mechanisms regulating catalytic activation and stability of PKC family members to allow for flexible and dynamic control of downstream functions, including MAPK signaling. The two PKC orthologs Pck1 and Pck2 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe operate in a redundant fashion to control essential functions, including morphogenesis and cell wall biosynthesis, as well as the activity of the cell integrity pathway and its core element, the MAPK Pmk1. We show here that, despite the strong structural similarity and functional redundancy of these two enzymes, the mechanisms regulating their maturation, activation, and stabilization have a remarkably distinct biological impact on both kinases. We found that, in contrast to Pck2, putative in vivo phosphorylation of Pck1 within the conserved activation loop, turn, and hydrophobic motifs is essential for Pck1 stability and biological functions. Constitutive Pck activation promoted dephosphorylation and destabilization of Pck2, whereas it enhanced Pck1 levels to interfere with proper downstream signaling to the cell integrity pathway via Pck2.

https://openalex.org/W2617137339,"Seed storage proteins are both an important source of nutrition for humans and essential for seedling establishment. Interestingly, unusual napin-type 2S seed storage albumin precursors in sunflowers contain a sequence that is released as a macrocyclic peptide during post-translational processing. The mechanism by which such peptides emerge from linear precursor proteins has received increased attention; however, the structural characterization of intact precursor proteins has been limited. Here, we report the 3D NMR structure of the Helianthus annuus PawS1 (preproalbumin with sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1) and provide new insights into the processing of this remarkable dual-destiny protein. In seeds, PawS1 is matured by asparaginyl endopeptidases (AEPs) into the cyclic peptide SFTI-1 (sunflower trypsin inhibitor-1) and a heterodimeric 2S albumin. The structure of PawS1 revealed that SFTI-1 and the albumin are independently folded into well-defined domains separated by a flexible linker. PawS1 was cleaved in vitro with recombinant sunflower HaAEP1 and in situ using a sunflower seed extract in a way that resembled the expected in vivo cleavages. Recombinant HaAEP1 cleaved PawS1 at multiple positions, and in situ, its flexible linker was removed, yielding fully mature heterodimeric albumin. Liberation and cyclization of SFTI-1, however, was inefficient, suggesting that specific seed conditions or components may be required for in vivo biosynthesis of SFTI-1. In summary, this study has revealed the 3D structure of a macrocyclic precursor protein and provided important mechanistic insights into the maturation of sunflower proalbumins into an albumin and a macrocyclic peptide.

https://openalex.org/W2617829723,"High blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The 2013 ACC/AHA Lifestyle Management Guideline recommends counseling pre-hypertensive and hypertensive patients to reduce sodium intake. Population sodium reduction efforts have been introduced in recent years, and dietary guidelines continued to emphasize sodium reduction in 2010 and 2015. The objective of this analysis was to determine changes in primary health care providers' sodium-reduction attitudes and counseling between 2010 and 2015. Primary care internists, family/general practitioners, and nurse practitioners answered questions about sodium-related attitudes and counseling behaviors in DocStyles, a repeated cross-sectional web-based survey in the United States. Differences in responses between years were examined. In 2015, the majority (78%) of participants (n = 1,251) agreed that most of their patients should reduce sodium intake, and reported advising hypertensive (85%), and chronic kidney disease patients (71%), but not diabetic patients (48%) and African-American patients (43%) to consume less salt. Since 2010, the proportion of participants agreeing their patients should reduce sodium intake decreased while the proportion advising patients with these characteristics to consume less salt increased and the prevalence of specific types of advice declined. Changes in behaviors between surveys remained significant after adjusting for provider and practice characteristics. More providers are advising patients to consume less salt in 2015 compared to 2010; however, fewer agree their patients should reduce intake and counseling is not universally applied across patient groups at risk for hypertension. Further efforts and educational resources may be required to enable patient counseling about sodium reduction strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2614081373,"Chronically elevated sympathetic nervous activity underlies many cardiovascular diseases. Elucidating the mechanisms contributing to sympathetic nervous system output may reveal new avenues of treatment. The contribution of the gap junctional protein connexin 36 (Cx36) to the regulation of sympathetic activity and thus blood pressure and heart rate was determined using a mouse with specific genetic deletion of Cx36. Ablation of the Cx36 protein was confirmed in sympathetic preganglionic neurons of Cx36-knockout (KO) mice. Telemetric analysis from conscious Cx36 KO mice revealed higher variance in heart rate and blood pressure during rest and activity compared to wild-type (WT) mice, and smaller responses to chemoreceptor activation when anesthetized. In the working heart–brain stem preparation of the Cx36-KO mouse, respiratory-coupled sympathetic nerve discharge was attenuated and responses to chemoreceptor stimulation and noxious stimulation were blunted compared to WT mice. Using whole cell patch recordings, sympathetic preganglionic neurons in spinal cord slices of Cx36-KO mice displayed lower levels of spikelet activity compared to WT mice, indicating reduced gap junction coupling between neurons. Cx36 deletion therefore disrupts normal regulation of sympathetic outflow with effects on cardiovascular parameters.—Lall, V.K., Bruce, G., Voytenko, L., Drinkhill, M., Wellershaus, K., Willecke, K., Deuchars, J., Deuchars, S.

https://openalex.org/W2617686703,"Arrestins specifically bind active and phosphorylated forms of their cognate G protein–coupled receptors, blocking G protein coupling and often redirecting the signaling to alternative pathways. High-affinity receptor binding is accompanied by two major structural changes in arrestin: release of the C-tail and rotation of the two domains relative to each other. The first requires detachment of the arrestin C-tail from the body of the molecule, whereas the second requires disruption of the network of charge-charge interactions at the interdomain interface, termed the polar core. These events can be facilitated by mutations destabilizing the polar core or the anchoring of the C-tail that yield “preactivated” arrestins that bind phosphorylated and unphosphorylated receptors with high affinity. Here we explored the functional role in arrestin activation of the three native cysteines in the N domain, which are conserved in all arrestin subtypes. Using visual arrestin-1 and rhodopsin as a model, we found that substitution of these cysteines with serine, alanine, or valine virtually eliminates the effects of the activating polar core mutations on the binding to unphosphorylated rhodopsin while only slightly reducing the effects of the C-tail mutations. Thus, these three conserved cysteines play a role in the domain rotation but not in the C-tail release.

https://openalex.org/W2617247862,"Currently available Interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) cannot reliably differentiate active TB (ATB) from non-active TB (non-ATB). A study was performed to evaluate the value of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) specific Th1 cell immune responses which test IFN-γ and IL-2 simultaneous for differentiating ATB from non-ATB. Forty-nine newly diagnosed inpatients with ATB (26 pulmonary TB and 23 extrapulmonary TB) were enrolled as the ATB group. Forty-five volunteers with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and twenty with evidence of previous TB were enrolled during the same period as the non-ATB group. Clinical examination and MTB specific Th1 cell immune responses were performed for all participants. After being stimulated with ESAT-6 and CFP-10, the median frequencies of single IL-2-, single IFN-γ-, and dual IFN-γ/IL-2-secreting T-cells were all higher in the ATB group than in the non-ATB group (20(8-45) vs. 7(3-13), P<0.001;131(44-308) vs. 10(6-27), P<0.001;25(9-74) vs. 7(3-23), P = 0.001, respectively). Evaluation of the diagnostic performance of detecting single IFN-γ-secreting T cells for pulmonary TB employed a cutoff value of 35 iSFCs/250,000 PBMC. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were 92.3%, 80.0%, 64.9%, 96.3%, 4.62, and 0.10, respectively. For extrapulmonary TB, using a cutoff value of 23 iSFCs/ 250,000 PBMC, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, PLR, and NLR were 91.3%, 76.9%, 58.3%, 96.2%, 3.96, and 0.11, respectively. When combining frequencies and proportion of single IFN-γ-secreting T cells, the test sensitivity was 100% in parallel tests and the specificity was 87.7% in serial tests for pulmonary TB. MTB specific Th1 cell immune responses (FluoroSpot) had value for the differentiation of ATB and non-ATB. Further confirmatory studies are indicated."
https://openalex.org/W2619125810,"Background Analyzing the disease-related web searches of Internet users provides insight into the interests of the general population as well as the healthcare industry, which can be used to shape health care policies. Methods We analyzed the searches related to neurological diseases and drugs used in neurology using the most popular search engines in the US, Google and Bing/Yahoo. Results We found that the most frequently searched diseases were common diseases such as dementia or Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), as well as medium frequency diseases with high social impact such as Parkinson’s disease, MS and ALS. The most frequently searched CNS drugs were generic drugs used for pain, followed by sleep disorders, dementia, ADHD, stroke and Parkinson’s disease. Regarding the interests of the healthcare industry, ADHD, Alzheimer’s disease, MS, ALS, meningitis, and hypersomnia received the higher advertising bids for neurological diseases, while painkillers and drugs for neuropathic pain, drugs for dementia or insomnia, and triptans had the highest advertising bidding prices. Conclusions Web searches reflect the interest of people and the healthcare industry, and are based either on the frequency or social impact of the disease."

https://openalex.org/W2618389842,"The activation of conventional T cells upon T cell receptor stimulation critically depends on protein kinase C theta (PKCθ). However, its role in regulatory T (Treg) cell function has yet to be fully elucidated. Using siRNA or the potent and PKC family-selective pharmacological inhibitor AEB071, we could show that murine Treg-mediated suppression in vitro is independent of PKCθ function. Likewise, Treg cells of PKCθ-deficient mice were fully functional, showing a similar suppressive activity as wild-type CD25+CD4+ T cells in an in vitro suppression assay. Furthermore, in vitro-differentiated wild-type and PKCθ-deficient iTreg cells showed comparable Foxp3 expression as well as suppressive activity. However, we observed a reduced percentage of Foxp3+CD25+ CD4+ T cells in the lymphatic organs of PKCθ-deficient mice. Taken together, our results suggest that while PKCθ is involved in Treg cell differentiation in vivo, it is dispensable for Treg-mediated suppression."
