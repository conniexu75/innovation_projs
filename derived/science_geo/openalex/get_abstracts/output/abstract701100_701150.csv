https://openalex.org/W4296608988,"The correct identification of mosquito species is important for effective mosquito vector control. However, the standard morphological identification of mosquito species based on the available keys is not easy with specimens in the field due to missing or damaged morphological features during mosquito collections, often leading to the misidentification of morphologically indistinguishable. To resolve this problem, we collected mosquito species across Thailand to gather genetic information, and evaluated the DNA barcoding efficacy for mosquito species identification in Thailand. A total of 310 mosquito samples, representing 73 mosquito species, were amplified using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( COI ) primers. The average maximum intraspecific genetic variation of the 73 mosquito species was 1% ranged from 0–5.7%. While, average minimum interspecific genetic variation (the distance to the nearest neighbour) of the 73 mosquito species was 7% ranged from 0.3–12.9%. The identification of success rates based on the “Best Match,” “Best Close Match,” and “All Species Barcodes” methods were 97.7%, 91.6%, and 81%, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses of Anopheles COI sequences demonstrated a clear separation between almost all species (except for those between An . baimaii and An . dirus ), with high bootstrap support values (97%–99%). Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses revealed potential sibling species of An . annularis , An . tessellatus , and An . subpictus in Thailand. Our results indicated that DNA barcoding is an effective molecular approach for the accurate identification of mosquitoes in Thailand."

However, there is limited knowledge on tissue-specific hormone distribution post-RYGB surgery and how this compares with best medical treatment (BMT). In the present study, pancreatic and ileal tissues were excised from male Zucker-Diabetic Sprague Dawley (ZDSD) rats 8-weeks after RYGB, BMT (daily oral dosing with metformin 300mg/kg, fenofibrate 100mg/kg, ramipril 1mg/kg, rosuvastatin 10mg/kg and subcutaneous liraglutide 0.2mg/kg) or sham operation (laparotomy). Insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, PYY, GLP-1 and GIP expression patterns were assessed using immunocytochemistry and analyzed using ImageJ. After RYGB and BMT, body weight and plasma glucose were decreased. Intestinal morphometry was unaltered by RYGB, but crypt depth was decreased by BMT. Intestinal PYY cells were increased by both interventions. GLP-1- and GIP-cell counts were unchanged by RYGB but BMT increased ileal GLP-1-cells and decreased those expressing GIP. The intestinal contents of PYY and GLP-1 were significantly enhanced by RYGB, whereas BMT decreased ileal GLP-1. No changes of islet and beta-cell area or proliferation were observed, but the extent of beta-cell apoptosis and islet integrity calculated using circularity index were improved by both treatments. Significantly decreased islet alpha-cell areas were observed in both groups, while beta- and PYY-cell areas were unchanged. RYGB also induced a decrease in islet delta-cell area. PYY and GLP-1 colocalization with glucagon in islets was significantly decreased in both groups, while co-staining of PYY with glucagon was decreased and that with somatostatin increased. These data characterize significant cellular islet and intestinal adaptations following RYGB and BMT associated with amelioration of obesity-diabetes in ZDSD rats. The differential responses observed and particularly those within islets, may provide important clues to the unique ability of RYGB to cause diabetes remission."
https://openalex.org/W4296793439,"Obstructed labour is a type of abnormal labour that is one of the causes of obstetric complications such as maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. Early detection is the key to reducing complications.This study aimed to assess the prevalence, causes, and factors associated with obstructed labor among mothers who gave birth at public health facilities in Mojo Town, Central Ethiopia.An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from November 10 to December 30, 2019 among 318 women who gave birth at public health facilities in Mojo Town. Face-to-face interviews and participants' medical record reviews were utilized to gather data. The collected data were checked, coded, and entered into EpiData version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. A binary logistic regression model was used to test the association between the dependent and independent variables. In bivariate analysis, all variables with a p-value less than 0.25 were included in multivariate analysis. Finally, a significant statistical association was declared at a p-value less than 0.05.The prevalence of obstructed labour in this study was 51 (16%), and cephalo-pelvic disproportion (66%), mal-presentation (22%), and mal-position (12%) were reported as causes of obstructed labour. Primgravidity (AOR = 7.74: 95%CI = 2.13, 18.2) and a one-time antenatal care follow-up (AOR = 9.50: 95%CI: 1.91, 33.07) were found to be associated factors with obstructed labour, while labour duration of 12-24 hours (AOR = 0.20: 95%CI = 0.17, 0.87) was identified as a factor decreasing the risk of obstructed labour.The prevalence of obstructed labour in this study was higher than in the majority of previous similar local and global studies. In this study setting, cephalo-pelvic disproportion, mal-presentation, and mal-position were found to be the causes of obstetric labour. Additionally, factors such as gravidity, frequency of antenatal follow-up, and duration of labour were significantly associated with obstructed labour. Therefore, the concerned entities need to work to curb young age pregnancy as well as to strengthen counselling mothers on the importance of subsequent antenatal-follows in the prevention of obstructed labour."
https://openalex.org/W4296793747,"Climate change is an ongoing topic in nearly all areas of society since many years. A discussion of climate change without referring to scientific results is not imaginable. This is especially the case for policies since action on the macro scale is required to avoid costly consequences for society. In this study, we deal with the question of how research on climate change and policy are connected. In 2019, the new Overton database of policy documents was released including links to research papers that are cited by policy documents. The use of results and recommendations from research on climate change might be reflected in citations of scientific papers in policy documents. Although we suspect a lot of uncertainty related to the coverage of policy documents in Overton, there seems to be an impact of international climate policy cycles on policy document publication. We observe local peaks in climate policy documents around major decisions in international climate diplomacy. Our results point out that IGOs and think tanks–with a focus on climate change–have published more climate change policy documents than expected. We found that climate change papers that are cited in climate change policy documents received significantly more citations on average than climate change papers that are not cited in these documents. Both areas of society (science and policy) focus on similar climate change research fields: biology, earth sciences, engineering, and disease sciences. Based on these and other empirical results in this study, we propose a simple model of policy impact considering a chain of different document types: The chain starts with scientific assessment reports (systematic reviews) that lead via science communication documents (policy briefs, policy reports or plain language summaries) and government reports to legislative documents."
https://openalex.org/W4296810137,"The clinical course of COVID-19 is highly variable. It is therefore essential to predict as early and accurately as possible the severity level of the disease in a COVID-19 patient who is admitted to the hospital. This means identifying the contributing factors of mortality and developing an easy-to-use score that could enable a fast assessment of the mortality risk using only information recorded at the hospitalization. A large database of adult patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 (n = 15,628; with 2,846 deceased) admitted to Spanish hospitals between December 2019 and July 2020 was analyzed. By means of multiple machine learning algorithms, we developed models that could accurately predict their mortality. We used the information about classifiers' performance metrics and about importance and coherence among the predictors to define a mortality score that can be easily calculated using a minimal number of mortality predictors and yielded accurate estimates of the patient severity status. The optimal predictive model encompassed five predictors (age, oxygen saturation, platelets, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatinine) and yielded a satisfactory classification of survived and deceased patients (area under the curve: 0.8454 with validation set). These five predictors were additionally used to define a mortality score for COVID-19 patients at their hospitalization. This score is not only easy to calculate but also to interpret since it ranges from zero to eight, along with a linear increase in the mortality risk from 0% to 80%. A simple risk score based on five commonly available clinical variables of adult COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital is able to accurately discriminate their mortality probability, and its interpretation is straightforward and useful."
https://openalex.org/W4296608963,"Islamic and capitalist economies have several differences, the most fundamental being that the Islamic economy is characterized by the prohibition of interest (riba) and speculation (gharar) and the enforcement of Shariah-compliant profit-loss sharing (mudaraba, murabaha, salam, etc.) and wealth redistribution (waqf, sadaqah, and zakat). In this study, I apply new econophysics models of wealth exchange and redistribution to quantitatively compare these characteristics to those of capitalism and evaluate wealth distribution and disparity using a simulation. Specifically, regarding exchange, I propose a loan interest model representing finance capitalism and riba and a joint venture model representing shareholder capitalism and mudaraba of an Islamic profit-loss sharing system; regarding redistribution, I create a transfer model representing inheritance tax and waqf of an Islamic wealth redistribution system. As exchanges are repeated from an initial uniform distribution of wealth, wealth distribution approaches a power-law distribution more quickly for the loan interest than the joint venture model; and the Gini index, representing disparity, rapidly increases. The joint venture model's Gini index increases more slowly, but eventually, the wealth distribution in both models becomes a delta distribution, and the Gini index gradually approaches 1. Next, when both models are combined with the transfer model to redistribute wealth in every given period, the loan interest model has a larger Gini index than the joint venture model, but both converge to a Gini index of less than 1. These results quantitatively reveal that in the Islamic economy, disparity is restrained by prohibiting riba and promoting reciprocal exchange in mudaraba and redistribution through waqf. Comparing Islamic and capitalist economies provides insights into the benefits of economically embracing the ethical practice of mutual aid and suggests guidelines for an alternative to capitalism."
https://openalex.org/W4296794109,"Skill retention is important for motor rehabilitation outcomes. Recent work has demonstrated that delayed visuospatial memory performance may predict motor skill retention in older and neuropathological populations. White matter integrity between parietal and frontal cortices may explain variance in upper-extremity motor learning tasks and visuospatial processes. We performed a whole-brain analysis to determine the white matter correlates of delayed visuospatial memory and one-week motor skill retention in nondemented older adults. We hypothesized that better frontoparietal tract integrity would be positively related to better behavioral performance. Nineteen participants (age>58) completed diffusion-weighted imaging, then a clinical test of delayed visuospatial memory and 50 training trials of an upper-extremity motor task; participants were retested on the motor task one week later. Principal component analysis was used to create a composite score for each participant's behavioral data, i.e. shared variance between delayed visuospatial memory and motor skill retention, which was then entered into a voxel-based regression analysis. Behavioral results demonstrated that participants learned and retained their skill level after a week of no practice, and their delayed visuospatial memory score was positively related to the extent of skill retention. Consistent with previous work, neuroimaging results indicated that regions within bilateral anterior thalamic radiations, corticospinal tracts, and superior longitudinal fasciculi were related to better delayed visuospatial memory and skill retention. Results of this study suggest that the simple act of testing for specific cognitive impairments prior to therapy may identify older adults who will receive little to no benefit from the motor rehabilitation regimen, and that these neural regions may be potential targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4296795951,"Unplanned readmissions shortly after discharge from hospital are common in chronic diseases. The risk of readmission has been shown to be related both to hospital care, e.g., medical complications, and to patients’ resources and abilities to manage the chronic disease at home and to make appropriate use of outpatient medical care. Despite a growing body of evidence on social determinants of health and health behaviour, little is known about the impact of social and contextual factors on readmission rates. The objective of this study was to analyse possible effects of educational, financial and social resources of patients with different chronic health conditions on unplanned 30 day-readmission risks. The study made use of nationwide inpatient hospital data that was linked with Swiss census data. The sample included n = 62,109 patients aged 25 and older, hospitalized between 2012 and 2016 for one of 12 selected chronic conditions. Multivariate logistic regressions analysis was performed. Our results point to a significant association between social factors and readmission rates for patients with chronic conditions. Patients with upper secondary education (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.44) and compulsory education (OR = 1.51, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.74) had higher readmission rates than those with tertiary education when taking into account demographic, social and health status factors. Having private or semi-private hospital insurance was associated with a lower risk for 30-day readmission compared to patients with mandatory insurance (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.90). We did not find a general effect of social resources, measured by living with others in a household, on readmission rates. The risk of readmission for patients with chronic conditions was also strongly predicted by type of chronic condition and by factors related to health status, such as previous hospitalizations before the index hospitalization (+77%), number of comorbidities (+15% higher probability per additional comorbidity) as well as particularly long hospitalizations (+64%). Stratified analysis by type of chronic condition revealed differential effects of social factors on readmissions risks. Compulsory education was most strongly associated with higher odds for readmission among patients with lung cancer (+142%), congestive heart failure (+63%) and back problems (+53%). We assume that low socioeconomic status among patients with chronic conditions increases the risk of unplanned 30-day readmission after hospitalisation due to factors related to their social situation (e.g., low health literacy, material deprivation, high social burden), which may negatively affect cooperation with care providers and adherence to recommended therapies as well as hamper active participation in the medical process and the development of a shared understanding of the disease and its cure. Higher levels of comorbidity in socially disadvantaged patients can also make appropriate self-management and use of outpatient care more difficult. Our findings suggest a need for increased preventive measures for disadvantaged populations groups to promote early detection of diseases and to remove financial or knowledge-based barriers to medical care. Socially disadvantaged patients should also be strengthened more in their individual and social resources for coping with illness."
https://openalex.org/W4296797521,"Linking several databases containing information on the same person is an essential step of many data workflows. Due to the potential sensitivity of the data, the identity of the persons should be kept private. Privacy-Preserving Record-Linkage (PPRL) techniques have been developed to link persons despite errors in the identifiers used to link the databases without violating their privacy. The basic approach is to use encoded quasi-identifiers instead of plain quasi-identifiers for making the linkage decision. Ideally, the encoded quasi-identifiers should prevent re-identification but still allow for a good linkage quality. While several PPRL techniques have been proposed so far, Bloom filter-based PPRL schemes (BF-PPRL) are among the most popular due to their scalability. However, a recently proposed attack on BF-PPRL based on graph similarities seems to allow individuals’ re-identification from encoded quasi-identifiers. Therefore, the graph matching attack is widely considered a serious threat to many PPRL-approaches and leads to the situation that BF-PPRL schemes are rejected as being insecure. In this work, we argue that this view is not fully justified. We show by experiments that the success of graph matching attacks requires a high overlap between encoded and plain records used for the attack. As soon as this condition is not fulfilled, the success rate sharply decreases and renders the attacks hardly effective. This necessary condition does severely limit the applicability of these attacks in practice and also allows for simple but effective countermeasures."
https://openalex.org/W4296799798,"Corporate environmental information disclosure is an important way for stakeholders to understand the performance of corporate environmental responsibilities. To explore the group relevance of corporate environmental information disclosure, this paper empirically tests the intra-industry peer effect of corporate environmental information disclosure using a panel fixed-effects model based on data of Chinese heavily polluted listed companies from 2015 to 2019 and studies its formation mechanism and impact path. The results show that there is an intra-industry peer effect in corporate environmental information disclosure; this effect exists in corporations of different ownership; social learning mechanism and environmental pressure mechanism are the channels to form the intra-industry peer effect of corporate environmental information disclosure; there are both intra-group imitation and inter-group imitation in the intra-industry peer effect of corporate environmental information disclosure. Based on the research results, the government can select corporations in various industries with excellent quality of environmental information disclosure as benchmarks to provide learning templates for corporations with inferior information. At the same time, the government can impose appropriate environmental protection pressure to promote learning and imitation among corporations. It is important to note that when selecting benchmarking companies, priority should be given to large and high-performing corporations."
https://openalex.org/W4296800191,"Cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are challenging lesions, often requiring multimodal interventions; however, data on the efficacy of stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral AVMs are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical and radiographic results following robotic radiosurgery, alone or in combination with endovascular treatment, and to investigate factors associated with obliteration and complications in patients with AVM.We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and imaging characteristics of 123 patients with AVMs of all Spetzler-Martin grades treated at two institutions by robotic radiosurgery in single-fraction doses (CyberKnife). Embolization was performed before radiosurgery in a subset of patients to attempt to downgrade the lesions. Factors associated with AVM obliteration and complications (toxicity) were identified via univariate and multivariate analyses.The median follow-up time was 48.1 months (range, 3.6-123 months). Five patients were lost to follow-up. The obliteration rate in the 59 patients with a follow-up period exceeding four years was 72.8%. Complete obliteration and partial remission were achieved in 67 (56.8%) and 31 (26.3%) cases, respectively, whereas no change was observed in 20 cases (17.8%). Embolization was performed in 54/123 cases (43.9%). Complete and partial obliteration were achieved in 29 (55.7%) and 14 (26.9%) embolized patients, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the factors associated with obliteration were age (p = .018) and the Spetzler-Martin grade (p = .041). Treatment-induced toxicity (radiation necrosis and/or edema) was observed in 15 cases (12.7%), rebleeding occurred in three cases (2.5%), and the rate of mortality associated with rebleeding was 1.7%.CyberKnife radiosurgery is a valid approach for treating AVMs of all Spetzler-Martin-grades, with satisfactory obliteration rates, low toxicity, and a relatively rare incidence of rebleeding."
https://openalex.org/W4296805727,"The eyes of insects display an incredible diversity of adaptations to enhance vision across the gamut of light levels that they experience. One commonly studied contrast is the difference in eye structure between nocturnal and diurnal species, with nocturnal species typically having features that enhance eye sensitivity such as larger eyes, larger eye facets, and larger ocelli. In this study, we compared eye structure between workers of closely related nocturnal and diurnal above ground foraging ant species (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in four genera (Myrmecocystus, Aphaenogaster, Temnothorax, Veromessor). In all four genera, nocturnal species tend to have little cuticular pigment (pale), while diurnal species are heavily pigmented (dark), hence we could use cuticle coloration as a surrogate for activity pattern. Across three genera (Myrmecocystus, Aphaenogaster, Temnothorax), pale species, as expected for nocturnally active animals, had larger eyes, larger facet diameters, and larger visual spans compared to their dark, more day active congeners. This same pattern occurred for one pale species of Veromessor, but not the other. There were no consistent differences between nocturnal and diurnal species in interommatidial angles and eye parameters both within and among genera. Hence, the evolution of eye features that enhance sensitivity in low light levels do not appear to have consistent correlated effects on features related to visual acuity. A survey across several additional ant genera found numerous other pale species with enlarged eyes, suggesting these traits evolved multiple times within and across genera. We also compared the size of the anterior ocellus in workers of pale versus dark species of Myrmecocystus. In species with larger workers, the anterior ocellus was smaller in pale than in dark species, but this difference mostly disappeared for species with smaller workers. Presence of the anterior ocellus also was size-dependent in the two largest pale species."
https://openalex.org/W4296807199,"Since first identified in 1879, plasma, the fourth state of matter, has been developed and utilised in many fields. Nonthermal atmospheric plasma, also known as cold plasma, can be applied to liquids, where plasma reactive species such as reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen species and their effects can be retained and mediated through plasma-activated liquids (PAL). In the medical field, PAL is considered promising for wound treatment, sterilisation and cancer therapy due to its rich and relatively long-lived reactive species components. This study sought to identify any potential antagonistic effect between antioxidative intracellularly accumulated platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and PAL. We found that PAL can significantly reduce the viability of glioblastoma U-251MG cells. This did not involve measurable ROS influx but instead lead to lipid damage on the plasma membrane of cells exposed to PAL. Although the intracellular antioxidative PtNPs showed no protective effect against PAL, this study contributes to further understanding of principle cell killing routes of PAL and discovery of potential PAL-related therapy and methods to inhibit side effects."
https://openalex.org/W4296608851,"Germline BRCA1/2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer has been associated with better progression-free survival and overall survival than sporadic epithelial ovarian cancer, but conclusive data are lacking.We matched 389 BRCA1-associated and 123 BRCA2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer patients 1:1 to sporadic epithelial ovarian cancer patients on year of birth, year of diagnosis, and FIGO stage (< = IIA/> = IIB). Germline DNA test was performed before or after epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis. All patients received chemotherapy. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the associations between mutation status (BRCA1 or BRCA2 versus sporadic) and progression-free survival and overall survival. To investigate whether DNA testing after epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis resulted in survival bias, we performed additional analyses limited to BRCA1/2-associated epithelial ovarian cancer patients with a DNA test result before cancer diagnosis (n = 73 BRCA1; n = 9 BRCA2) and their matched sporadic controls.The median follow-up was 4.4 years (range 0.1-30.1). During the first three years after epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis, progression-free survival was better for BRCA1 (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.74-1.04) and BRCA2 (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.41-0.81) patients than for sporadic patients. Overall survival was better during the first six years after epithelial ovarian cancer for BRCA1 (HR 0.7, 95% CI 0.58-0.84) and BRCA2 (HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.29-0.59) patients. After surviving these years, survival benefits disappeared or were in favor of the sporadic patients.For epithelial ovarian cancer patients who received chemotherapy, we confirmed survival benefit for BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline pathogenic variant carriers. This may indicate higher sensitivity to chemotherapy, both in first line treatment and in the recurrent setting. The observed benefit appears to be limited to a relatively short period after epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W4296608964,"Different from vehicle engines, Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) inactivation is an unavoidable issue for low-speed marine diesel engines fueled with Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). This paper introduced a sulfur resisting material in Silicon Carbide (SiC)-DPF to improve DPF performance. The results of bench-scale experiments showed that the Balance Point Temperature of the modified DPF module was 300°C and DPF modules had a good filtration performance, with Particulate Matters (PMs) residual being less than 0.6 g per cycle. In pilot-scale tests, PMs emissions of unit power decreased with engine load going up, filtration efficiency of nucleation mode PMs being only 36% under 100% load, while DPF still had a good performance in accumulation mode PMs control, being 94.2% under the same load. DPF modules showed excellent regeneration durability in the 205h endurance test, with a regeneration period of 1.5-2h under 380°C. There was no obvious degeneration in the DPF module structure, with no cracks or breakage. Besides, the DPF module could also control gaseous emissions, total emissions decreased by 10.53% for NO and 57.19% for CO, respectively. The results suggested that introducing sulfur-resisting material in DPF could greatly improve the DPF performance of low-speed marine diesel engines fueled with HFO."

These disparities are encoded by binocular neurons in the visual cortex. At the earliest stage of processing, these respond to binocular correlation between images. We assessed the perception of depth in anticorrelated stimuli, in which the contrast polarity in one eye is reversed, as a function of their location in the retinal image, and their depth configuration (a horizontal edge or a circle surrounded by an annulus) We found that, regardless of stimulus eccentricity, participants perceived depth in the natural direction for edge stimuli, and weakened, reversed depth for circular stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W4296608980,"Background and purpose The limbic brain is involved in diverse cognitive, emotional, and autonomic functions. Injury of the various parts of the limbic system have been correlated with clinical deficits in MS. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively examine different regions of the subcortical limbic system to assess the extent of damage within this entire system as it may be pertinent in correlating with specific aspects of cognitive and behavioral dysfunction in MS by using a fully automated, unbiased segmentation approach. Methods Sixty-seven subjects were included in this study, including 52 with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 15 healthy controls. Only patients with stable MS disease, without any relapses, MRI activity, or disability progression were included. Subcortical limbic system segmentation was performed using the FreeSurfer pipeline ScLimbic, which provides volumes for fornix, mammillary bodies, hypothalamus, septal nuclei, nucleus accumbens, and basal forebrain. Hippocampus and anterior thalamic nuclei were added as additional components of the limbic circuitry, also segmented through FreeSurfer. Whole limbic region mask was generated by combining these structures and used for Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis. Results The mean [95% confidence interval] of the total limbic system volume was lower (0.22% [0.21–0.23]) in MS compared to healthy controls (0.27%, [0.25–0.29], p &lt; .001). Pairwise comparisons of individual limbic regions between MS and controls was significant in the nucleus accumbens (0.046%, [0.043–0.050] vs. 0.059%, [0.051–0.066], p = .005), hypothalamus (0.062%, [0.059–0.065] vs. 0.074%, [0.068–0.081], p = .001), basal forebrain (0.038%, [0.036–0.040] vs. 0.047%, [0.042–0.051], p = .001), hippocampus (0.47%, [0.45–0.49] vs. 0.53%, [0.49–0.57], p = .004), and anterior thalamus (0.077%, [0.072–0.082] vs. 0.093%, [0.084–0.10], p = .001) after Bonferroni correction. Volume of several limbic regions was significantly correlated with T2 lesion burden and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). Multiple regression model showed minimal influence of BPF on limbic brain volume and no influence of other demographic and disease state variables. VBM analysis showed cluster differences in the fornix and anterior thalamic nuclei at threshold p &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for covariates but the results were insignificant after family-wise error corrections. Conclusions The results show evidence that brain volume loss is fairly extensive in the limbic brain. Given the significance of the limbic system in many disease states including MS, such volumetric analyses can be expanded to studying cognitive and emotional disturbances in larger clinical trials. FreeSurfer ScLimbic pipeline provided an efficient and reliable methodology for examining many of the subcortical structures related to the limbic brain."
https://openalex.org/W4296793566,"Mobility deficits have been identified as an independent risk factor for hospital readmission for adults ≥65 years. Despite evidence indicating how determinants additively influence and predict mobility, no hospital-to-home care transition models comprehensively assess all seven mobility determinants, cognitive, financial, environmental, personal, physical, psychological, and social. There is currently a lack of clarity regarding what factors clinicians and researchers should evaluate for each mobility determinant. The purpose of this e-Delphi study is to prioritize and reach consensus on the factors for each mobility determinant that are critical to assess as part of the Comprehensive Mobility Discharge Assessment Framework (CMDAF) when older adults are discharged from hospital-to-home.This protocol paper is an international modified e-Delphi study following the Recommendations for the Conducting and Reporting of Delphi Studies. International researchers, clinicians, older adults and family caregivers residing in a country with universal or near-universal health coverage will be invited to participate as 'experts' in three e-Delphi rounds administered through DelphiManager©. The e-Delphi Round 1 questionnaire will be developed based on scoping review findings and will be pilot tested. For each round, experts will be asked to rate factors for each determinant that are critical to assess as part of the CMDAF using a 9-point scale: Not Important (1-3), Important but Not Critical (4-6), and Critical (7-9). The scale will include a selection option of ""unable to score"" and experts will also be asked to provide a rationale for their scoring and suggest missing factors. Experts will receive feedback summaries in Rounds 2 and 3 to guide them in reflecting on their initial responses and re-rating of factors that have not reached consensus. The criteria for reaching consensus will be if ≥70% of experts rate a factor as ""critical"" (scores ≥7) and ≤ 15% of experts rate a factor as ""not important"" (scores≤ 3). Quantitative data will be analyzed using median values, frequencies, percentages, interquartile range, and bar graphs; Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test will be used to assess the stability of participants' responses. Rationale (qualitative data) provided in the open-ended comments section will be analyzed using content analysis.This study is a first step in developing the CMDAF and will be used to guide a subsequent e-Delphi survey to decide on the tools that should be used to measure the examples of each factor included in our framework."
https://openalex.org/W4296793572,"Limited studies evaluate the outcome of intravenous antibiotics to oral transition in Gram-negative bloodstream infection (GN-BSI), particularly GN-BSI originating outside the urinary tract. This study aimed to evaluate treatment success in patients with GN-BSI treated with either intravenous therapy or intravenous to oral transition and to identify factors associated with treatment failure in those undergoing intravenous to oral transition.A retrospective cohort study was conducted at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand. Patients were included if they were ≥18 years of age, hospitalized in general medical wards with GN-BSI between August 1, 2015, to July 31, 2020, received intravenous antibiotic agents and had a functioning gastrointestinal tract.Of 955 patients, 545 (57.1%) were in the intravenous to oral transition group. The urinary tract was the most common source of infection (38.8%). Ciprofloxacin was the most prescribed oral antibiotic (53%). Treatment success occurred in 94.3% in the intravenous antibiotic to oral transition group. There was no significant difference in treatment success between the two groups (P = 0.790) with a concordant result after using propensity score matching (P = 0.223). Independent predictors of treatment failure in the intravenous to oral transition group included metastatic solid cancer (aOR = 4.355), HIV infection with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 (aOR = 8.452), qSOFA score ≥ 2 (aOR = 2.545), multidrug-resistant infection (aOR = 2.849), and respiratory tract infection (aOR = 8.447). Hospital length of stay in the intravenous to oral transition group was shorter than in the intravenous group (P < 0.001).Intravenous to oral transition may be a practical approach in GN-BSI. Patients with Gram-negative bacteremia who have HIV infection with CD4 < 200 cells/mm3, multidrug-resistant infections, and respiratory tract sources of infection may not be ideal candidates for this approach. Future research is needed from a randomized controlled trial."
https://openalex.org/W4296793773,"Cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (C-tDCS) is generally assumed to inhibit cortical excitability. The parietal cortex contributes to multisensory information processing in the postural control system, and this processing is proposed to be different between the right and left hemispheres and sensory modality. However, previous studies did not clarify whether the effects of unilateral C-tDCS of the parietal cortex on the postural control system differ depending on the hemisphere. We investigated the changes in static postural stability after unilateral C-tDCS of the parietal cortex.Ten healthy right-handed participants were recruited for right- and left-hemisphere tDCS and sham stimulation, respectively. The cathodal electrode was placed on either the right or left parietal area, whereas the anodal electrode was placed over the contralateral orbit. tDCS was applied at 1.5 mA for 15 min. We evaluated static standing balance by measuring the sway path length (SPL), mediolateral sway path length (ML-SPL), anteroposterior sway path length (AP-SPL), sway area, and the SPL per unit area (L/A) after 15-minute C-tDCS under eyes open (EO) and closed (EC) conditions. To evaluate the effects of C-tDCS on pre- and post-offline trials, each parameter was compared using two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) with factors of intervention and time. A post-hoc evaluation was performed using a paired t-test. The effect sizes were evaluated according to standardized size-effect indices of partial eta-squared (ηp2) and Cohen's d. The power analysis was calculated (1-β).A significant interaction was observed between intervention and time for SPL (F (2, 27) = 4.740, p = 0.017, ηp2 = 0.260), ML-SPL (F (2, 27) = 4.926, p = 0.015, ηp2 = 0.267), and sway area (F (2, 27) = 9.624, p = 0.001, ηp2 = 0.416) in the EO condition. C-tDCS over the right hemisphere significantly increased the SPL (p < 0.01, d = 0.51), ML-SPL (p < 0.01, d = 0.52), and sway area (p < 0.05, d = 0.83) in the EO condition. In contrast, C-tDCS over the left hemisphere significantly increased the L/A in both the EC and EO condition (EO; p < 0.05, d = 0.67, EC; p < 0.05, d = 0.57).These results suggest that the right parietal region contributes to static standing balance through chiefly visual information processing during the EO condition. On the other hand, L/A increase during EC and EO by tDCS over the left parietal region depends more on somatosensory information to maintain static standing balance during the EC condition."

However, the exact rate of clinical obstruction in patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy who do not receive a defunctioning stoma is not known. Furthermore, it is not clear which factors predispose patients to developing clinical large bowel obstruction. Given that defunctioning stomas are associated with post operative and intra-operative risks, it is not currently possible to tailor defunctioning stomas to patients who have the greatest risk of developing obstruction. This systematic review which is in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement (PRISMA), aims to define the role of defunctioning stomas in prevention of obstruction patients with locally advanced colon or rectal cancer while undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. Two researchers will perform the literature search which will include all published and ""in process"" articles published in the English language between 2002-2022 in the following databases: EMBASE (OVID), MEDLINE (EBSCO), CINHAL complete, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Clinical Trials Registry. The full text of the selected articles will be independently screened by two researchers against the inclusion criteria. Data will be extracted from each article regarding: study design, participants, type of intervention and outcomes. The effect size will be expressed in incidence rates and when appropriate in relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. If possible, we will perform a meta-analysis. Heterogeneity will be assessed using I2 statistics. We will pool the data extracted from the randomised controlled trials to perform a meta-analysis using the Review Manager 5 software (RevMan 5). The Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system will be used to assess the certainty of the evidence."
https://openalex.org/W4296794555,"Purpose Genetic variants identified through population-based genome-wide studies are generally of high frequency, exerting their action in the central part of the refractive error spectrum. However, the power to identify associations with variants of lower minor allele frequency is greatly reduced, requiring considerable sample sizes. Here we aim to assess the impact of rare variants on genetic variation of refractive errors in a very large general population cohort. Methods Genetic association analyses of non-cyclopaedic autorefraction calculated as mean spherical equivalent (SPHE) used whole-exome sequence genotypic information from 50,893 unrelated participants in the UK Biobank of European ancestry. Gene-based analyses tested for association with SPHE using an optimised SNP-set kernel association test (SKAT-O) restricted to rare variants (minor allele frequency &lt; 1%) within protein-coding regions of the genome. All models were adjusted for age, sex and common lead variants within the same locus reported by previous genome-wide association studies. Potentially causal markers driving association at significant loci were elucidated using sensitivity analyses by sequentially dropping the most associated variants from gene-based analyses. Results We found strong statistical evidence for association of SPHE with the SIX6 (p-value = 2.15 x 10 −10 , or Bonferroni-Corrected p = 4.41x10 -06 ) and the CRX gene (p-value = 6.65 x 10 −08 , or Bonferroni-Corrected p = 0.001). The SIX6 gene codes for a transcription factor believed to be critical to the eye, retina and optic disc development and morphology, while CRX regulates photoreceptor specification and expression of over 700 genes in the retina. These novel associations suggest an important role of genes involved in eye morphogenesis in refractive error. Conclusion The results of our study support previous research highlighting the importance of rare variants to the genetic risk of refractive error. We explain some of the origins of the genetic signals seen in GWAS but also report for the first time a completely novel association with the CRX gene."

A particularly endangered group were students, who became highly affected by measures of social distance due to their active lifestyle. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to assess the level of self-reported stress, anxiety and depression of the student population in Serbia, in relation to demographic characteristics, living and studying conditions, students' activities during the epidemic, potential coronavirus infection and general, mental and physical health.We conducted a cross-sectional study of 580 undergraduate medical students from the University of Belgrade during the 2020/2021 school year. Mental health data were collected using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were used to examine the association between independent variables with the dependent variable mental health.Women made up the majority of the sample with 80.3%. A total of 64.5%, 66.8% and 66.7% of students between the ages of 21 and 30 had severe depressive symptoms, severe degree of anxiety, and a severe degree of stress, respectively. Women almost twice as often (OR = 1.89) assessed their anxiety as severe and almost two and a half times more (OR = 2.39) perceived stress as severe compared to men. Students who lived with their families during studies two and a half times (OR = 2.57) more often assessed their stress as severe, compared to students who lived alone. Fifth- and sixth-year students were less likely to rate depression and anxiety as serious than the first-year students.Medical students reported their health as severely impaired in terms of depression, anxiety and stress reactions. The results indicate the need to launch a mental health program in the form of counseling and emotional support to students affected by the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4296794622,"Nutrition and growth are strongly linked, but not much is known about how nutrition leads to growth. To understand the connection between nutrition through the diet, growth, and proliferation, we need to study the phenotypes resulting from the activation and inhibition of central metabolic pathways. One of the most highly conserved metabolic pathways across eukaryotes is the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway, whose primary role is to detect the availability of nutrients and to either induce or halt cellular growth. Here we used the model organism Drosophila melanogaster ( D . mel .) and three non-model Drosophila species with different dietary needs, Drosophila guttifera ( D . gut .), Drosophila deflecta ( D . def .), and Drosophila tripunctata ( D . tri .), to study the effects of dietary amino acid availability on fecundity and longevity. In addition, we inhibited the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway, using rapamycin, to test how the inhibition interplays with the nutritional stimuli in these four fruit fly species. We hypothesized that the inhibition of the TOR pathway would reverse the phenotypes observed under conditions of overfeeding. Our results show that female fecundity increased with higher yeast availability in all four species but decreased in response to TOR inhibition. The longevity data were more varied: most species experienced an increase in median lifespan in both genders with an increase in yeast availability, while the lifespan of D . mel . females decreased. When exposed to the TOR inhibitor rapamycin, the life spans of most species decreased, except for D . tri , while we observed a major reduction in fecundity across all species. The obtained data can benefit future studies on the evolution of metabolism by showing the potential of using non-model species to track changes in metabolism. Particularly, our data show the possibility to use relatively closely related Drosophila species to gain insight on the evolution of TOR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4296795679,"Indian soils are inherently poor in quality due to the warm climate and erosion. Conversion of land uses like forests to croplands and faulty management practices in croplands further cause soil degradation. This study aimed to understand the extent of these impacts in a small representative part of eastern India, covering Himalayan terai and nearing alluvial plains. Soils were collected from (i) forests, (ii) croplands (under agricultural practices for more than 50-60 years) and (iii) converted lands (converted from forests to croplands or tea gardens over the past 15-20 years). Different soil quality indicators were assessed and soil quality index (SQI) was generated to integrate, scale and allot a single value per soil. Results indicated that continuous organic matter deposition and no disturbances consequence the highest presence of soil carbon pools, greater aggregation and maximum microbial dynamics in forest soils whereas high application of straight fertilizers caused the highest available nitrogen and phosphorus in cropland soils. The SQI scorebook indicated the best soil quality under forests ([Formula: see text] 0.532), followed by soils of converted land ([Formula: see text] 0.432) and cropland ([Formula: see text] 0.301). Comparison of the SQI spatial distribution with land use and land cover confirmed the outcome. Possibly practices like excessive tillage, high cropping intensity, no legume in crop rotations, cultivation of heavy feeder crops caused degraded soil quality in croplands. This study presented an example of soil quality degradation in India due to land use change and faulty management practices. Such soil degradation on a larger scale may affect future food security."
https://openalex.org/W4296796053,"As the effects of climate change become more visible, extreme weather events are becoming more common. The effects of flooding on health are understood but the long-term impact on the well-being of those affected need to be considered. This mixed methods secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey examined the extent to which being flooded in the past is associated with ongoing concerns about flooding. Survey data were collected from residents in Hull 11 years after the initial flooding event. Respondents were asked about the floods in 2007 and their current level of concern about flooding. Ordinal logistic regression explored the effect of age and tenancy status as predictors of current concern. Textual data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Responses were received from 457 households, of whom 202 (48%) were affected by flooding in 2007. A fifth of respondents were very concerned about future flooding. Those who were not flooded were significantly less concerned about the risk of future flooding (U = 33391.0, z = 5.89, p < 0.001). Those who reported negative health and wellbeing effects from the floods were significantly more concerned about future flooding than those whose health was not affected (U = 7830.5, z = 4.43, p < 0.001). Whilst some residents were reassured by the introduction of new flood alleviation schemes, others did not feel these were adequate, and worried about the impact of climate change. The financial and emotional impacts of the floods still resonated with families 11 years after the event, with many fearing they would not cope if it happened again. Despite the 2007 floods in Hull happening over a decade ago, many of those affected continue to experience high levels of anxiety when storms are forecast. Residents feel powerless to protect themselves, and many remain unconvinced by the presence of new flood alleviation schemes. However, with the ongoing threat of climate change, it may be that other residents are unrealistic in their expectation to be 'protected' from flood events. Therefore, public health agencies need to be able to mobilize organizations to come together to pro-actively support families affected by flooding, to ensure those in need do not fall through the gaps of public healthcare delivery."
https://openalex.org/W4296796496,"The primary purpose of this time-lapse data analysis was to identify the association between the nucleation status of a Day 2 preimplantation embryo and live births following in vitro fertilization (IVF). The retrospective data analysis was based on 2769 transferred embryos from 1966 treatment cycles and utilised only Known Implantation Data (KID) for live births. Nucleation errors (NE) such as micronucleation, binucleation, multinucleation and minor error groups, were annotated in the time-lapse images which were taken every 15 minutes for a minimum of 44 hours post insemination. Further, factors that may impact NE and the relationship of early morphological attributes and morphokinetic variables with NE occurrence were explored. The frequency of NE among the transferred embryos was 23.8%. The reversibility of NE evidenced by their presence at the two-cell stage, but absence at the four-cell stage was 89.6%. Embryos exhibiting nucleation errors at the two-cell stage had significantly lower live birth rates compared to embryos with no nucleation errors, constituting a significant predictor. A Generalized Additive Mixed Model was used to control for confounders and for controlling clustering effects from dual embryo transfers. Increased incidences of NE were observed with increasing age, with delayed occurrence of cell divisions and in oocytes inseminated with surgically retrieved spermatozoa. NE assessment and their impact on live birth provides valuable markers for early preimplantation embryo selection. In addition, the high incidence of reversibility of NE and their possible impact on live birth suggest that incorporating two-cell nuclear status annotations in embryo selection, alongside morphology and morphokinetics, is of value."
https://openalex.org/W4296803904,"In large-scale aquatic ecological studies, direct habitat descriptors (e.g. water temperature, hydraulics in river reaches) are often approximated by coarse-grain surrogates (e.g. air temperature, discharge respectively) since they are easier to measure or model. However, as biological variability can be very strong at the habitat scale, surrogate variables may have a limited ability to capture all of this variability, which may lead to a lesser understanding of the ecological processes or patterns of interest. In this study, we aimed to compare the capacity of direct habitat descriptors vs. surrogate environmental variables to explain the organization of fish and macroinvertebrate communities across the Loire catchment in France (10 5 km 2 ). For this purpose, we relied on high-resolution environmental data, extensive biological monitoring data (&gt;1000 sampling stations) and multivariate analyses. Fish and macroinvertebrate abundance datasets were considered both separately and combined to assess the value of a cross-taxa approach. We found that fish and macroinvertebrate communities exhibited weak concordance in their organization and responded differently to the main ecological gradients. Such variations are probably due to fundamental differences in their life-history traits and mobility. Regardless of the biological group considered, direct habitat descriptors (water temperature and local hydraulic variables) consistently explained the organization of fish and macroinvertebrate communities better than surrogate descriptors (air temperature and river discharge). Furthermore, the organization of fish and macroinvertebrate communities was slightly better explained by the combination of direct or surrogate environmental variables when the two biological groups were considered together than when considered separately. Tied together, these results emphasize the importance of using a cross-taxa approach in association with high-resolution direct habitat variables to more accurately explain the organization of aquatic communities."

https://openalex.org/W4296608941,"Severe viral respiratory diseases, such as SARS-CoV-2, are transmitted through aerosol particles produced by coughing, talking, and breathing. Medical procedures including tracheal intubation, extubation, dental work, and any procedure involving close contact with a patient's airways can increase exposure to infectious aerosol particles. This presents a significant risk for viral exposure of nearby healthcare workers during and following patient care. Previous studies have examined the effectiveness of plastic enclosures for trapping aerosol particles and protecting health-care workers. However, many of these enclosures are expensive or are burdensome for healthcare workers to work with. In this study, a low-cost plastic enclosure was designed to reduce aerosol spread and viral transmission during medical procedures, while also alleviating issues found in the design and use of other medical enclosures to contain aerosols. This enclosure is fabricated from clear polycarbonate for maximum visibility. A large single-side cutout provides health care providers with ease of access to the patient with a separate cutout for equipment access. A survey of medical providers in a local hospital network demonstrated their approval of the enclosure's ease of use and design. The enclosure with appropriate plastic covers reduced total escaped particle number concentrations (diameter > 0.01 μm) by over 93% at 8 cm away from all openings. Concentration decay experiments indicated that the enclosure without active suction should be left on the patient for 15-20 minutes following a tracheal manipulation to allow sufficient time for >90% of aerosol particles to settle upon interior surfaces. This decreases to 5 minutes when 30 LPM suction is applied. This enclosure is an inexpensive, easily implemented additional layer of protection that can be used to help contain infectious or otherwise potentially hazardous aerosol particles while providing access into the enclosure."

There is limited data on mortality in patients transfused with whole blood in sub-Saharan Africa. We described the 30-day all-cause mortality and its associated factors in patients transfused with whole blood to inform appropriate clinical intervention and research priorities to mitigate potential risks. A retrospective study was performed on purposively sampled patients transfused with whole blood at the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) and Mulago hospital in the year 2018. Two thousand twelve patients with a median (IQR) age of 39 (28-54) years were enrolled over a four month period. There were 1,107 (55%) females. Isolated HIV related anaemia (228, 11.3%), gynaecological cancers (208, 10.3%), unexplained anaemia (186, 9.2%), gastrointestinal cancers (148, 7.4%), and kidney disease (141, 7.0%) were the commonest diagnoses. Most patients were transfused with only one unit of blood (n = 1232, 61.2%). The 30 day all-cause mortality rate was 25.2%. Factors associated with mortality were isolated HIV related anaemia (HR 3.2, 95% CI, 2.3-4.4), liver disease (HR 3.0, 95% CI, 2.0-4.5), kidney disease (HR 2.2, 95% CI, 1.5-3.3; p<0.01), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.9, 95% CI, 1.6-5.4; p<0.01), respiratory disease (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.8-4.9; p<0.01), diabetes mellitus (HR 4.1, 95% CI, 2.3-7.4; p<0.01) and sepsis (HR 6.2, 95% CI 3.7-10.4; p<0.01).

Factors associated with mortality were isolated HIV related anaemia, kidney disease, liver disease, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus and sepsis. Transfusion with additional blood was associated with survival. These findings require further prospective evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4296793729,"Background The diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) consists of extreme emotional dysregulation and long-term disability when left untreated. It is associated with ineffective use of health care systems and mismanaged care in emergency departments, which can result in a revolving door phenomenon of urgent system usage, poor treatment outcomes, or patients falling out of care entirely–all of which primarily affect patients with BPD as well as their caregivers and clinicians. This crisis must be addressed with a comprehensive understanding of key stakeholder perspectives on the challenges of the system and potential solutions. Objective This study explored the perspectives of three key stakeholder groups (i.e., patients, clinicians, and caregivers) in relation to their experiences with and future expectations of the care system for those affected by BPD. Methods Four patients with BPD, three generalist clinicians with experience treating BPD, and three caregivers of individuals with BPD participated in individual semi-structured interviews. Participants were asked about their experiences with the current healthcare system and their suggestions for improvement. Responses were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings In-depth analysis of the qualitative data revealed twelve shared themes and three themes that were unique to each key stakeholder group. These themes are discussed and used to inform recommendations for promising practices, policies, and training in this area. Conclusion Findings support the importance of a comprehensive mental health system approach for improving the accessibility, effectiveness, and acceptability of the management and treatment of BPD."

Among the agro climatic zones of West Bengal, India growing solanaceous vegetables, the maximum and minimum incidence of bacterial wilt was observed in Red and Lateritic zone (42.4%) and Coastal and Saline zone (26.9%), respectively. The present investigation reports the occurrence of bacterial wilt of Bottle gourd by R. solanacearum Sequevar 1-48 for the first time in India. Two new biovars (6 and 3b) along with biovar 3 have been found to be prevalent in West Bengal. Under West Bengal condition, the most predominant Sequevar was I-48 (75%) followed by I-47 (25%). Low genetic variation (18.9%) among agro climatic zones (ACZs) compared to high genetic variation (81.1%) within revealed occurrence of gene flow among these ACZs. Standard genetic diversity indices based on the concatenated sequences of the seven genes revealed ACZ-6 as highly diverse among five agro climatic zones. The multi locus sequence analysis illustrated occurrence of synonymous or purifying selection in the selected genes in West Bengal and across world. Under West Bengal conditions maximum nucleotide diversity was observed for the gene gyrB. Occurrence of significant recombination was confirmed by pairwise homoplasy test (θ = 0.47*) among the RSSC isolates of West Bengal, belonging to Phylotype I. Phylotype I isolates of West Bengal are involved in exchange of genetic material with Phylotype II isolates. In case of worldwide RSSC collection, eleven significant recombination events were observed among the five phylotypes. Phylotype IV was genetically most diverse among all the Phylotypes. The most recombinogenic phylotype was Phylotype III. Further, the most diverse gene contributing to the evolution of RSSC worldwide was observed to be endoglucanase (egl)."

https://openalex.org/W4296796064,"Background Very preterm (VP) infants (born 28 to &lt;32 weeks of gestation) are at risk of cognitive delays and lower educational attainments. These risks are linked to anomalies in attention and information processing that emerge in the first years of life. Early interventions targeting attention functioning may equip VP infants with key building blocks for later attainments. Methods We tested the feasibility of a randomised trial where VP infants took part in a computerised cognitive procedure to train attention control. Ten healthy VP infants aged approximately 12 months (corrected age) and randomly allocated with 1:1 ratio to the training (interactive computerised presentations) or an active control procedure completed the study. Before and after the training programme, participating infants completed a battery of screen-based attention tests, naturalistic attention and communication tasks, and temperament assessments. In a previous study we analysed the data concerning feasibility (e.g. recruitment and retention). In the paper presented here we considered the infants’ performance and used Bayesian regression in order to provide credible treatment estimates considering the data collected. Results Estimates indicate moderate treatment effects in visual memory: compared to controls, trained infants displayed improvements equivalent to 0.59 SD units. Trained infants also improved in their abilities to attend to less salient stimuli presentations by 0.82 SD units, compared to controls. However, results did not indicate relevant gains in attention habituation or disengagement. We also reported moderate improvements in focused attention during naturalistic tasks, and in directing other people’s attention to shared objects. Discussion The results warrant further investigation concerning the effectiveness of training attention control in VP infants, extending this line of research beyond our small and homogeneous sample of healthy VP infants. This study also emphasises the utility of Bayesian approaches in estimating potentially relevant effects in small samples or exploratory studies. The scope for further research on early attention control training is discussed in light of studies indicating VP children’s susceptibility to positive environmental inputs.

The consumptive uses of Cuenca city in their different categories and social metabolism both at rural and urban levels were assessed, inquiring about diverse typologies of the city's water. Water Metabolic Rates (WMR) were calculated for each one of the consumptives' uses gauged in liters per hour of human activity. Our results indicate that farming and industrial uses of water were highly inefficient. Linked to farms, both consumption of water and metabolic rates were higher in the rural areas. While paid work showed higher metabolic rates than households. Rural households evidenced a greater use of water and higher metabolic rates than urban households as water use combines human consumption and family farming.

https://openalex.org/W4296798137,"Agroecosystem management influences ecological interactions that underpin ecosystem services. In human-centered systems, people’s values and preferences influence management decisions. For example, aesthetic preferences for ‘tidy’ agroecosystems may remove vegetation complexity with potential negative impacts on beneficial associated biodiversity and ecosystem function. This may produce trade-offs in aesthetic- versus production-based management for ecosystem service provision. Yet, it is unclear how such preferences influence the ecology of small-scale urban agroecosystems, where aesthetic preferences for ‘tidiness’ are prominent among some gardener demographics. We used urban community gardens as a model system to experimentally test how aesthetic preferences for a ‘tidy garden’ versus a ‘messy garden’ influence insect pests, natural enemies, and pest control services. We manipulated gardens by mimicking a popular ‘tidy’ management practice–woodchip mulching–on the one hand, and simulating ‘messy’ gardens by adding ‘weedy’ plants to pathways on the other hand. Then, we measured for differences in natural enemy biodiversity (abundance, richness, community composition), and sentinel pest removal as a result of the tidy/messy manipulation. In addition, we measured vegetation and ground cover features of the garden system as measures of practices already in place. The tidy/messy manipulation did not significantly alter natural enemy or herbivore abundance within garden plots. The manipulation did, however, produce different compositions of natural enemy communities before and after the manipulation. Furthermore, the manipulation did affect short term gains and losses in predation services: the messy manipulation immediately lowered aphid pest removal compared to the tidy manipulation, while mulch already present in the system lowered Lepidoptera egg removal. Aesthetic preferences for ‘tidy’ green spaces often dominate urban landscapes. Yet, in urban food production systems, such aesthetic values and management preferences may create a fundamental tension in the provision of ecosystem services that support sustainable urban agriculture. Though human preferences may be hard to change, we suggest that gardeners allow some ‘messiness’ in their garden plots as a “lazy gardener” approach may promote particular natural enemy assemblages and may have no downsides to natural predation services."
https://openalex.org/W4296798715,"This article presents the results of a study conducted on Polish university students to verify how they assess the probability of environmental risks and their potential impact on the socio-economic situation in Poland. To this end, 703 students of public universities in Warsaw were asked to complete risk assessment questionnaires. According to the respondents, of all identified types of threats, technological risks were found to be the most probable, with the environmental ones carrying the most significant social and economic impact. Among those risks, climate change was recognised as the most probable, while environmental contamination was perceived as having the strongest potential impact on Poland. No statistically significant differences were found in the views of women and men on the probability of environmental risks and their impact on the country's socio-economic situation. Compared with students of technical and economic faculties, students of natural sciences, education, and nursing assessed the probability of environmental risks and the strength of their potential impact in Poland as much higher. The results of the study can be used to develop a communication strategy dedicated to young people in the education of environmental risks."
https://openalex.org/W4296799948,"Eicosanoids, which are oxygenated derivatives of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), serve as signaling molecules that regulate spermatogenesis in mammals. However, their roles in crustacean sperm development remain unknown. In this study, the testis and vas deferens of the black tiger shrimp Penaeus monodon were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap high resolution mass spectrometry. This led to the identification of three PUFAs and ten eicosanoids, including 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and (±)15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid ((±)15-HEPE), both of which have not previously been reported in crustaceans. The comparison between wild-caught and domesticated shrimp revealed that wild-caught shrimp had higher sperm counts, higher levels of (±)8-HEPE in testes, and higher levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and prostaglandin F2α in vas deferens than domesticated shrimp. In contrast, domesticated shrimp contained higher levels of (±)12-HEPE, (±)18-HEPE, and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in testes and higher levels of 15d-PGJ2, (±)12-HEPE, EPA, arachidonic acid (ARA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in vas deferens than wild-caught shrimp. To improve total sperm counts in domesticated shrimp, these broodstocks were fed with polychaetes, which contained higher levels of PUFAs than commercial feed pellets. Polychaete-fed shrimp produced higher total sperm counts and higher levels of PGE2 in vas deferens than pellet-fed shrimp. In contrast, pellet-fed shrimp contained higher levels of (±)12-HEPE, (±)18-HEPE, and EPA in testes and higher levels of (±)12-HEPE in vas deferens than polychaete-fed shrimp. These data suggest a positive correlation between high levels of PGE2 in vas deferens and high total sperm counts as well as a negative correlation between (±)12-HEPE in both shrimp testis and vas deferens and total sperm counts. Our analysis not only confirms the presence of PUFAs and eicosanoids in crustacean male reproductive organs, but also suggests that the eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway may serve as a potential target to improve sperm production in shrimp."
https://openalex.org/W4296800554,"Rink hockey is a highly specialized and physiological demanding sport with sparse research regarding the game and athletes' characteristics. A cross-sectional study was developed to characterize the body composition and grip strength of elite male rink hockey players and to establish the relationship between ethnicity on body composition and grip strength. A sample of 100 elite rink-hockey athletes aged 26.59 ± 6.02 participated in the study, comprised of 69 Caucasian male adults aged 27.58 ± 6.44 years and 31 Black African male adults aged 24.39 ± 4.27. Body composition was assessed by anthropometric measurements. Static grip strength was assessed with an adjustable dynamometer. Multiple regression analysis was applied to understand which variables constraints body fat percentage (BF) and grip strength. Body mass showed an average of 76.36 ± 9.18 kg for 175.80 ± 5.87 cm of height and BF% of 10.82 ± 5.07%. Maximal right grip strength was 50.91 ± 6.26 kg and 50.27 ± 6.23 kg for left grip strength. Four predictors accounted for 70.01% of the variance of BF%: abdominal circumference (p < 0.001), right thigh circumference (p < 0.001), right calf circumference (p = 0.001) and ethnicity (p = 0.016). Three predictors accounted for 13.1% of the variance of right grip strength: ethnicity (p = 0.013), chronological age (p = 0.024) and right distal thigh circumference (p = 0.014). Results suggest that elite rink hockey athletes have a specific anthropometric identity, which at the elite level may lead to reduced body fat and greater handgrip strength. Ethnicity seems to predict body fat and grip strength in elite rink hockey athletes."

https://openalex.org/W4296801288,"Human papilloma virus is associated with oral and oropharyngeal cancer. Our aim was to examine oral health in patients with oropharyngeal (OPSCC) and oral tongue cancer (OTSCC), expecting better oral health among OPSCC patients.Fifty-five OPSCC patients with known HPV status and 59 OTSCC patients were randomly selected from a list of consecutive patients of the Helsinki University Hospital, Finland. Oral health was assessed from panoramic jaw radiographs. Total Dental Index (TDI) summarizing the dental health status was calculated and Finnish population study data were used for comparison. Descriptive statistics were used for analyses.Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC had higher periapical lesion index compared with HPV-negative OPSCC patients or with OTSCC patients. Residual roots were more common among OPSCC patients compared with OTSCC patients, because of their higher occurrence among HPV-negative OPSCC patients compared with OTSCC patients. Similarly, modified TDI score was significantly higher among OPSCC patients than among OTSCC patients, because of higher TDI score among HPV-negative OPSCC patients compared with OTSCC patients. OPSCC patients more often used a removable prosthesis than OTSCC patients. Dental health of the cancer patients was poorer when compared with the population data.Our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed. Periapical lesions were more prevalent among HPV-positive OPSCC patients, compared with the other groups. The number of residual roots was higher among HPV-negative subgroup. Thus, OPSCC patients had worse oral health parameters than OTSCC patients."
https://openalex.org/W4296803616,"Spinal cord infarction (SCI) is difficult to diagnosis using MRI findings. We aimed to suggest the optimal timing of MRI studies for diagnosing SCI.This retrospective study was approved by our institutional review board. The requirement for informed consent was waived. MRI scans of SCI patients diagnosed between January 2015 and August 2019 were enrolled in the SCI group and subdivided according to the interval between symptom onset and time of MRI scan (A, within 6 h; B, 6-12 hours; C, 12-24 hours; D, 24-72 hours; E, 3-7 days). Three radiologists analyzed the T2WI scans and evaluated the confidence level of diagnosing SCI using a five-point Likert scale: 1, certainly not; 2, probably not; 3, equivocal; 4, probably yes; 5, certainly yes. Scores of 4 and 5 were defined as ""T2WI-positive SCI"" and scores of 1-3 were defined as ""T2WI-negative SCI"".The SCI group included 58 MRI scans of 34 patients (mean age, 60.6 ± 14.0 years; 18 women). The T2WI positivity rate was 72.4% (42/58). In contrast to the other subgroups, subgroup A included fewer cases of T2WI-positive SCI (1/4, 25%) than T2WI-negative SCI. A confidence score of 5 was the most common in subgroup D (4/27, 14.8%). Among the 12 patients who underwent MRI studies more than twice, confidence scores increased with time.In patients with suspected SCI showing equivocal initial MRI findings, follow-up MRI studies are helpful, especially when performed between 24 and 72 hours after symptom onset."
https://openalex.org/W4296803711,"Participatory research approaches have developed in response to the growing emphasis on translation of research evidence into practice. However, there are few published examples of stakeholder engagement strategies, and little guidance specific to larger ongoing research programs or those with a rural focus. This paper describes the evolution, structure, and processes of an annual Rural Dementia Summit launched in 2008 as an engagement strategy for the Rural Dementia Action Research (RaDAR) program and ongoing for more than 10 years; and reports findings from a parallel mixed-methods study that includes stakeholder and researcher perspectives on the Summit’s value and impact. Twelve years of stakeholder evaluations were analyzed. Rating scale data were summarized with descriptive statistics; open-ended questions were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis. A thematic analysis was also used to analyze interviews with RaDAR researchers. Rating scale data showed high stakeholder satisfaction with all aspects of the Summit. Five themes were identified in the qualitative data: hearing diverse perspectives, building connections, collaborating for change, developing research and practice capacity, and leaving recharged. Five themes were identified in the researcher data: impact on development as a researcher, understanding stakeholder needs, informing research design, deepening commitment to rural dementia research, and building a culture of engagement. These findings reflect the key principles and impacts of stakeholder engagement reported in the literature. Additional findings include the value stakeholders place on connecting with stakeholders from diverse backgrounds, how the Summit was revitalizing, and how it developed stakeholder capacity to support change in their communities. Findings indicate that the Summit has developed into a community of practice where people with a common interest come together to learn and collaborate to improve rural dementia care. The Summit’s success and sustainability are linked to RaDAR’s responsiveness to stakeholder needs, the trust that has been established, and the value that stakeholders and researchers find in their participation."
https://openalex.org/W4296805601,"Estuarine fish assemblages are often sensitive to environmental conditions, because fluctuation in physico-chemical conditions at different spatial and seasonal scales can directly influence species distributions. In this way, we conducted a field survey to investigate the role of estuarine gradient (environmental heterogeneity) in fish α and β diversity. The study was carried out in three zones in Mamanguape River estuary according to salinity and geomorphology features during an atypical climatic event in 2015. In total, 18,084 specimens of 125 species were captured. Additive partitioning of diversity analysis detected a higher proportion of beta diversity among estuarine zones during the rainy (β3 = 58.6%) and dry season (β3 = 40.94%) and were higher than expected by chance (Propexp> obs <0.001). Decomposing β-diversity analysis showed that total β-diversity (βsor) results were more dominated by species turnover (βsim) than nestedness (βnes) in both seasons. Forward selection procedure and db-RDA identified salinity, coarse sand and chlorophyll-a as the main environmental variables influencing βsor and site distance from estuary mouth and split as the main landscape variables. Variation partitioning analysis revealed more contribution to the pure fraction of environmental variables to fish species turnover, however, both pure fraction of environmental and landscape variables significantly contributed to βsim. Our study highlighted the importance to environmental heterogeneity and connectivity to promote fish diversity across the Mamanguape River estuary. Thus, future conservation policies should focus on maintaining these two components to guarantee its nursery ground role to estuarine fish assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W4296807145,"Cleft lip is the most common congenital anomaly worldwide. Nevertheless, lip somatosensory characteristics of patients with cleft lip after cheiloplasty have not yet been determined. The present study used magnetoencephalography to objectively evaluate the lip sensation in patients with unilateral cleft lip to establish a new objective evaluation method.Participants were 15 patients with unilateral cleft lip after cheiloplasty (UCL group), and 30 healthy young subjects (control group). Five points of the upper and lower lips were stimulated electrically to measure somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs). The sources of the magnetic fields were modeled as single equivalent current dipoles (ECDs). ECDs located on the central sulcus by superimposition on magnetic resonance images were analyzed. Latency and intensity at 50-75 ms (cP60m) observed in the UCL group were compared with those in the control group. Thresholds of tactile stimuli in both groups were obtained using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments for subjective sensory evaluation.No significant difference was found in the intensity of the cP60m or subjective evaluation between the groups. However, the latency of the cP60m was significantly longer in the upper lip of the UCL group than in the control group.SEFs showed a difference in lip sensation between the UCL group and the control group, suggesting that longer latency might be caused by the effects of surgical scarring on the neurotransmission pathway. These results suggest SEFs as useful for the objective evaluation of lip sensations. This study might improve future surgical procedures and lip functions of patients with cleft lip."
https://openalex.org/W4296808297,"Plants respond to environmental stressors, such as an oligotrophic environments, by altering the morphological and physiological functions of their leaves. Sex affects these functions because of the asymmetric cost of reproduction in dioecious plants. We compared the leaf mass per leaf area (LMA), ratio of intercellular air space in leaf mesophyll tissue (mesophyll porosity), palisade thickness, and carbon isotope ratio (δ13C) of leaves of the dioecious shrub Myrica gale based on sex and gradients of soil water chemistry across habitats in the field. The PCA showed that the first three principal components accounted for 84.5% of the variation. PC1 to PC3 were associated with the origin of soil water, nitrogen status of habitats, and sea-salt contributions, respectively. LMA varied from 5.22 to 7.13 μg/cm2, and it was positively related to PC2 and negatively related to PC3, but not to PC1 or sex, suggesting that LMA was low under poor nitrogen conditions and varied with salinity. Mesophyll porosity values were over 50% for all habitats. Mesophyll porosity was positively affected by PC3 and smaller in females than in males. This suggests that M. gale exhibits differences in mesophyll anatomy according to sex. Palisade thickness ranged from 0.466 to 0.559 mm/mm. The leaves of females had thinner palisade layers per mesophyll layer than those of males; however, the habitat did not affect the thickness of the palisade layer per mesophyll layer. The δ13C values of leaves varied from -32.14 to -30.51 ‰. We found that δ13C values were positively related to PC2 but not to PC1, PC3, and sex. Under poor nitrogen conditions, the δ13C of M. gale leaves decreased, suggesting that nutrient deficiency would decrease more under the long-term averaged ratio of photosynthesis than stomatal conductance, leading to low water use efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W4296809671,"This study explored the contexts in which native Japanese listeners have difficulty identifying prosodic focus. Using a 4AFC identification task, we compared native Japanese listeners' focus identification accuracy in different lexical accent × focus location conditions using resynthesised speech stimuli, which varied only in fundamental frequency. Experiment 1 compared the identification accuracy in lexical accent × focus location conditions using both natural and resynthesised stimuli. The results showed that focus identification rates were similar with the two stimulus types, thus establishing the reliability of the resynthesised stimuli. Experiment 2 explored these conditions further using only resynthesised stimuli. Narrow foci bearing the lexical pitch accent were always more correctly identified than unaccented ones, whereas the identification rate for final focus was the lowest among all focus locations. From these results, we argue that the difficulty of focus perception in Japanese is attributed to (i) the blocking of PFC by unaccented words, and (ii) similarity in F0 contours between lexical pitch accent and narrow focus, including in particular the similarity between downstep and PFC. Focus perception is therefore contingent on other concurrent communicative functions which may sometimes take precedence in a +PFC language."
https://openalex.org/W4296810521,"In chronic kidney disease dogs, the inflammatory process increases C-reactive protein concentrations. This study aimed to determine C-reactive protein serum concentrations in stage IV chronic kidney disease dogs treated with intermittent hemodialysis. A prospective cohort study was conducted with 23 dogs allocated into three groups: control group (CG, n = 7), intermittent hemodialysis group (IHG, n = 8) and clinical treatment group (CTG, n = 8), both comprised of stage IV chronic kidney disease dogs. One blood sample from CG (initial evaluation) and two samples from IHG and CTG (first- and last-moment) were obtained to determine C-reactive protein concentration, total leukocytes, platelets, erythrocytes, total plasma protein, serum albumin, urea, creatinine, and phosphorus. C-reactive protein was higher in IHG compared to CG in the first- and last-moments (p <0.001) and compared to CTG in the first-moment (p = 0.0406). C-reactive protein presented moderate positive correlation with leukocytes (r = 0.5479; p = 0.01), and moderate negative correlation with albumin (r = - 0.5974; p = 0.006) and red blood cells (r = - 0.5878, p = 0.01). A high correlation coefficient was observed in the tests' evaluation (CI = 0.59-0.78; r = 0.70; P<0.0001). In conclusion, both assays used in this study to measure C-reactive protein have provided safe and reliable quantification of the results. Additionally, despite IHG dogs presented an active inflammatory profile, intermittent hemodialysis has proven to be beneficial, leading to a clinical improvement in life quality of patients, and thus being recommended for stage IV CKD dogs when performed by trained professionals."
