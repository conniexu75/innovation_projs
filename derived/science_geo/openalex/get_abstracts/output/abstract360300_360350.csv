https://openalex.org/W2008370035,"Here, we demonstrate self-organized formation of apico-basally polarized cortical tissues from ESCs using an efficient three-dimensional aggregation culture (SFEBq culture). The generated cortical neurons are functional, transplantable, and capable of forming proper long-range connections in vivo and in vitro. The regional identity of the generated pallial tissues can be selectively controlled (into olfactory bulb, rostral and caudal cortices, hem, and choroid plexus) by secreted patterning factors such as Fgf, Wnt, and BMP. In addition, the in vivo-mimicking birth order of distinct cortical neurons permits the selective generation of particular layer-specific neurons by timed induction of cell-cycle exit. Importantly, cortical tissues generated from mouse and human ESCs form a self-organized structure that includes four distinct zones (ventricular, early and late cortical-plate, and Cajal-Retzius cell zones) along the apico-basal direction. Thus, spatial and temporal aspects of early corticogenesis are recapitulated and can be manipulated in this ESC culture."
https://openalex.org/W2104708641,"Somatic cells can be induced into pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) with a combination of four transcription factors, Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc or Oct4/Sox2/Nanog/LIN28. This provides an enabling platform to obtain patient-specific cells for various therapeutic and research applications. However, several problems remain for this approach to be therapeutically relevant due to drawbacks associated with efficiency and viral genome integration. Recently, it was shown that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) transduced with Oct4/Klf4 can be reprogrammed into iPSCs. However, NPCs express Sox2 endogenously, possibly facilitating reprogramming in the absence of exogenous Sox2. In this study, we identified a small-molecule combination, BIX-01294 and BayK8644, that enables reprogramming of Oct4/Klf4-transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which do not endogenously express the factors essential for reprogramming. This study demonstrates that small molecules identified through a phenotypic screen can compensate for viral transduction of critical factors, such as Sox2, and improve reprogramming efficiency.

Previous studies demonstrated that stable genomic integration and high expression of four factors, Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc or Oct4/Sox2/Nanog/LIN28, can reprogram fibroblast cells, B cells, and liver and stomach epithelial cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Hanna et al., 2008Hanna J.

It was later shown that iPSCs can be generated by viral integration of Oct4/Sox2/Klf4 without c-Myc (Aoi et al., 2008Aoi T. Yae K. Nakagawa M. Ichisaka T. Okita K. Takahashi K. Chiba T. Yamanaka S.

Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). Such iPSCs exhibited reduced tumorigenicity in chimeras and progeny mice (Nakagawa et al., 2008Nakagawa M. Koyanagi M. Tanabe K. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Okita K. Mochiduki Y. Takizawa N. Yamanaka S. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells without Myc from mouse and human fibroblasts.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of c-Myc overexpression, the reprogramming process is much slower, and efficiency is substantially lower. These studies also suggested that the ectopic expression of these three transcription factors (TFs) is required for reprogramming, since combination of three factors excluding one of them (i.e., Oct4/Klf4/c-Myc, Oct4/Sox2/c-Myc, or Klf4/Sox2/c-Myc) was unsuccessful to reprogram general somatic cells into authentic iPSCs (Aoi et al., 2008Aoi T. Yae K. Nakagawa M. Ichisaka T. Okita K. Takahashi K. Chiba T. Yamanaka S.

Since the viral integration of these TFs is not a viable therapeutic option, in this present study, we directed our efforts in finding small molecules that could replace the presence of virally transduced TFs in a quest to ultimately find a chemical cocktail that would allow reprogramming of somatic cells in chemically defined conditions. Recently, we and others have shown that if the target somatic cells are chosen carefully, it is possible to use an endogenously expressed reprogramming gene to help in generating iPSCs (Kim et al., 2008Kim J.B. Zaehres H. Wu G. Gentile L. Ko K. Sebastiano V. Arauzo-Bravo M.J. Ruau D. Han D.W. Zenke M. Scholer H.R.

In these studies, neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which endogenously express Sox2 (Blelloch et al., 2006Blelloch R. Wang Z. Meissner A. Pollard S. Smith A. Jaenisch R. Reprogramming efficiency following somatic cell nuclear transfer is influenced by the differentiation and methylation state of the donor nucleus.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2007-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), were transduced with Oct4 and Klf4 alone (OK) and were successfully reprogrammed to iPSCs. Furthermore, we found that this process was greatly enhanced by the presence of a G9a histone methyltransferase (G9a HMTase) inhibitor, BIX-01294 (BIX) (Kubicek et al., 2007Kubicek S. O'Sullivan R.J. August E.M. Hickey E.R. Zhang Q. Teodoro M.L. Rea S. Mechtler K. Kowalski J.A. Homon C.A. et al.Reversal of H3K9me2 by a small-molecule inhibitor for the G9a histone methyltransferase.Mol.

A combined chemical and genetic approach for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 525-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In addition, we observed that BIX could enable reprogramming of NPCs transduced with c-Myc, Klf4, and Sox2, in the absence of Oct4 ectopic expression. Therefore, in this particular system, BIX seemed to compensate for the lack of Oct4 overexpression. This present study aimed to assess if a similar strategy could be used to find small molecules that can replace specific viral transduction to obtain iPSCs from a general cell lineage, in which none of the TFs deemed essential for reprogramming, Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, are expressed. Hence, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were used. Finding a small molecule that could replace one of these TFs in the induction of MEF reprogramming might lead to the identification of general pathways involved in this process. Such chemical strategy might also be more amenable for therapeutic application. Consequently, we screened a collection of known drugs to identify small molecules that can enable the generation of iPSCs from MEFs transduced with Oct4 and Klf4 (OK) and thus could compensate for the lack of Sox2 overexpression. Through the different screens performed, we identified that a combination of BIX with Bayk8644 (BayK), a L-channel calcium agonist (Schramm et al., 1983Schramm M. Thomas G. Towart R. Franckowiak G. Novel dihydropyridines with positive inotropic action through activation of Ca2+ channels.Nature. 1983; 303: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar) was one of the most effective. Bayk was of interest because it exerts its effect upstream in cell signaling pathways and does not directly cause epigenetic modifications. It is likely that this type of molecule can be exploited to induce reprogramming in a more specific manner than molecules acting directly at the epigenetic level causing DNA or histone modification. Some of these epigenetic modifiers have already been shown to facilitate the reprogramming process, such as BIX (Shi et al., 2008Shi Y. Do J.T. Desponts C. Hahm H.S. Scholer H.R. Ding S. A combined chemical and genetic approach for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 525-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), valproic acid (Huangfu et al., 2008Huangfu D. Maehr R. Guo W. Eijkelenboom A. Snitow M. Chen A.E. Melton D.A. Induction of pluripotent stem cells by defined factors is greatly improved by small-molecule compounds.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 795-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), and 5′ azacytidine (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang X. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Dissecting direct reprogramming through integrative genomic analysis.Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). This present study demonstrates that small molecules identified through a phenotypic screen can be used to effectively compensate for the viral transduction of a critical iPSC TF, Sox2. Moreover, it highlights the important contribution that small-molecule screens will eventually make to the discovery of new molecular targets and mechanisms involved in complicated biological processes such as reprogramming. Unmodified MEFs derived from E13–E14 embryos of the 129 mice were used for the initial screen. MEFs were plated on Matrigel at 3.5 × 104 cells/well of a 6-well plate and transduced with OK (retroviral vectors expressing Oct4 and Klf4) alone. Within 14–21 days, treated cells were assessed for the appearance of colonies that had the characteristic embryonic stem cell (ESC) colony morphology and were positive for the pluripotency marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Such OK-transduced cells generated only a few small noncompact colonies, which were weakly positive for ALP expression (Figures 1A and 1C). These colonies initially appeared within 21 days after viral transduction and were difficult to expand. Therefore, such assay system offered a clean background for the identification of small molecules having desirable reprogramming-inducing activity. Using this system, compounds from a library of around 2000 known small molecules (see Experimental Procedures) were screened and were identified as hits when they induced the appearance of ESC colonies that were strongly positive for ALP within 14–21 days after treatment. This image-based method provided a more accurate assessment of reprogramming as compared to homogenous reporter-based assay. Among several primary hits that induced formation of more than one to two compact ESC-like colonies with strong ALP staining, we focused on the small molecule with the strongest effect, BIX. We observed that when MEFs were treated with BIX after OK viral transduction, compact colonies with high levels of ALP expression could be readily detected within approximately 14–21 days (Figure 1A). These cells were also positive for Nanog, Oct4, and SSEA-1 expression (data not shown). This result, obtained with a more general cell type, which does not endogenously express any of the three essential reprogramming genes, further validates our previous observation that BIX has strong reprogramming-inducing activity and inhibition of the G9a HMTase can facilitate reprogramming (Shi et al., 2008Shi Y. Do J.T. Desponts C. Hahm H.S. Scholer H.R. Ding S. A combined chemical and genetic approach for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 525-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, the reprogramming efficiency in MEFs transduced with OK and treated with BIX was still low in comparison to the four-factor-induced reprogramming of MEFs or the OK/BIX NPC reprogramming. Furthermore, this small molecule acts directly at the epigenetic level and appears to have a broad range of action. To identify additional compounds with reprogramming activity, we conducted a second screen using a similar protocol, but where BIX was added to the basal media after OK viral transduction. This provided a more permissive platform to identify new small molecules that could further improve reprogramming efficiency. More importantly, this second screen could facilitate discovery of small molecules that impact reprogramming in a more specific manner, for example, by acting on signal transduction pathways rather than on histone or DNA modifying enzymes. In this second screen, we again assayed a library of approximately 2000 known small molecules (see Experimental Procedures) and found two that were able to act with BIX to improve reprogramming, based on the criteria of the screen. One was RG108, a DNA methyltransferase (DMNT) inhibitor (Brueckner et al., 2005Brueckner B. Boy R.G. Siedlecki P. Musch T. Kliem H.C. Zielenkiewicz P. Suhai S. Wiessler M. Lyko F. Epigenetic reactivation of tumor suppressor genes by a novel small-molecule inhibitor of human DNA methyltransferases.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 6305-6311Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) that enhanced reprogramming of OK-transduced MEFs in the presence of BIX (Figure 2A). However, as this molecule, like BIX, is known to impact the cells at a general epigenetic level, and the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine has already been shown to enhance reprogramming (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S. Hanna J. Zhang X. Ku M. Wernig M. Schorderet P. Bernstein B.E. Jaenisch R. Lander E.S. Meissner A. Dissecting direct reprogramming through integrative genomic analysis.Nature. 2008; 454: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), RG108 was not pursued further for this study. Instead, we focused our phenotypic and functional characterization on another small molecule that was identified in the second screen, BayK, an L-calcium channel agonist. This small molecule was studied further because it has no observable reprogramming activity on OK-transduced MEFs in the absence of BIX and is not known to impact the cells directly at the epigenetic level, but rather at the cell signal transduction level. Therefore, BayK might play a more specific role in the reprogramming process. When OK-transduced MEFs were treated with BIX in combination with BayK, a significant increase in the number and size of ALP+ colonies that closely resemble the mESC morphology could be observed (Figures 1A and 1D) as compared to OK-transduced MEFs treated with BIX alone. Further characterization of these primary iPSC colonies showed that they were positive for standard pluripotency markers such as Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and SSEA1 (Figure 1E) as determined by immunofluorescence.Figure 2Generation of OK2B iPSCs from Primary OG2 MEFsShow full caption(A) Bar graph showing the average number of GFP+ colonies induced from OG2-MEFs in three independent experiments.

DAPI was used as nuclear staining. To further confirm and characterize that OK transduction and BIX/BayK treatment can induce MEFs to become iPSCs, we used primary MEFs derived from OG2+/−/ROSA26+/− (OG2) transgenic mice, which contain an Oct4-GFP reporter (Do and Scholer, 2004Do J.T. Scholer H.R. Nuclei of embryonic stem cells reprogram somatic cells.Stem Cells. 2004; 22: 941-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Once reprogrammed, these cells could then be used to conveniently assess chimera and germline competency. Similarly to 129 MEFs, OG2 MEFs transduced with OK could generate iPSCs when treated with a combination of BayK/BIX (OK2B iPSCs) (Figures 2A and 2B). GFP+ iPSC colonies could be first detected on day 14–21 after viral transduction and compound treatment. When OG2 MEFs were transduced with OK and not treated with any compounds, only a few small colonies appeared for an average of 0.5 ± 0.7 colony per 3.5 × 104 cells. These colonies were difficult to passage and therefore were not studied any further. Treatment of OK-transduced OG2 MEFs with BIX alone readily and reproducibly enabled reprogramming as compared to OK alone, with 2.5 ± 0.7 colonies per 3.5 × 104 cells (Figure 2A). There was a further significant improvement in the reprogramming efficiency when OG2 MEFs transduced with OK were treated with the combination of BIX (2 μM) and BayK (2 μM), where we observed 7.7 ± 1.5 colonies per 3.5 × 104 cells (Figure 2A). Treatment of OK-transduced OG2 MEFs with BayK alone, in the absence of BIX, did not increase reprogramming efficiency above OK-transduced MEF control (data not shown). OK2B colonies were picked out and serially expanded on irradiated MEF feeder cells in the conventional mESC growth conditions in the absence of small molecules for more than 20 passages. Staining (Figures 2C–2G) and/or RT-PCR (Figure 3A) showed that these GFP+ OK2B iPSCs express typical pluripotency markers, including ALP, Nanog, Sox2, Oct4, SSEA1, c-Myc, eRas, Esg1, Ecat1, and Fgf4. RT-PCR assay also demonstrated that OK2B iPSCs expressed endogenous Oct4 and Klf4 (Figure 3A). Bisulphite genomic sequencing analyses of the Nanog promoter revealed that it is demethylated in OK2B iPSCs similarly to the mESC control (R1), while the MEFs' Nanog promoter was hypermethylated (Figure 3B). This result further suggests a reactivation of the stem cell transcription program in these OK2B iPSCs. In addition, transcriptome analysis showed that expression profile of OK2B iPSCs is greatly similar to the one of mESCs with a Pearson correlation value of 0.96, while significantly different to MEFs' profile with a Pearson correlation value of 0.84 as exemplified in the clustering analysis (see Figure S1 available online). OK2B iPSCs could efficiently form embryoid bodies (EB) in suspension, which could differentiate into endodermal cells (Albumin and Pdx1), mesodermal cells/cardiac muscle cells (CT3), and ectodermal cells/neurons (βIII-tubulin, Tuj1), derivatives of the three primary germ layers (Figure 4A). In addition, OK2B iPSCs could efficiently incorporate into the inner cell mass of a blastocysts (Figure 4Ba) following aggregation with an eight-cell embryo and lead to chimerism (Figure 4Bb) with germline contribution (Figure 4Bc) in vivo after the aggregated embryos were transplanted into pseudopregnant mice. Moreover, mating of one adult male progeny obtained from these blastocysts (Figure 4C) with a female CD1 wild-type mouse led to the production of LacZ+ progeny (Figure 4Da), three of which showed Oct4-GFP+ cells (Figure 4Db), further validating that these iPSCs could contribute to germline transmission (Figures 4B–4D). These in vitro and in vivo characterizations confirm retroviral transduction with only two genes, Oct4 and Klf4, and in conjunction with BIX/BayK treatment are sufficient to reprogram MEFs into iPSCs, which are phenotypically and functionally similar to the classic mESCs. The studies presented here provide a further demonstration that small molecules can be identified from rationally designed phenotypic screens to functionally replace viral transduction of certain TF(s), as well as improve reprogramming efficiency in generating iPSCs from a general cell type like MEFs. Such a chemical approach for the generation of iPSCs, which offers more precise and temporal control of the target/process, would be advantageous over the genetic manipulation with oncogenes that may also introduce harmful hard-to-detect insertional genomic alterations. Similar strategies are being used to find additional small molecules that may ultimately allow reprogramming of lineage-restricted cells to pluripotent or multipotent state in a completely chemically defined condition. BIX was originally identified and characterized as a specific inhibitor for G9a HMTase (Kubicek et al., 2007Kubicek S. O'Sullivan R.J. August E.M. Hickey E.R. Zhang Q. Teodoro M.L. Rea S. Mechtler K. Kowalski J.A. Homon C.A. et al.Reversal of H3K9me2 by a small-molecule inhibitor for the G9a histone methyltransferase.Mol. Cell. 2007; 25: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). It has been shown to reduce H3K9me2 levels at G9a target genes (Feldman et al., 2006Feldman N. Gerson A. Fang J. Li E. Zhang Y. Shinkai Y. Cedar H. Bergman Y. G9a-mediated irreversible epigenetic inactivation of Oct-3/4 during early embryogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Interestingly, histone H3K9 methylation, mediated by G9a, and heterochromatinization represent a highly specific mechanism for epigenetic silencing of embryonic genes such as Oct4 and Rex1 (Feldman et al., 2006Feldman N. Gerson A. Fang J. Li E. Zhang Y. Shinkai Y. Cedar H. Bergman Y. G9a-mediated irreversible epigenetic inactivation of Oct-3/4 during early embryogenesis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was also demonstrated that knockdown of G9a can assist in fusion-based reprogramming of adult neuronal cells (Ma et al., 2008Ma D.K. Chiang C.H. Ponnusamy K. Ming G.L. Song H. G9a and Jhdm2a regulate embryonic stem cell fusion-induced reprogramming of adult neural stem cells.Stem Cells. 2008; 26: 2131-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). It is therefore fitting that we previously observed that BIX can facilitate the generation of iPSCs from NPCs transduced with either OK or Klf4/Sox2/c-Myc (Shi et al., 2008Shi Y. Do J.T. Desponts C. Hahm H.S. Scholer H.R. Ding S. A combined chemical and genetic approach for the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 525-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), suggesting that it can compensate for the exogenous expression of Sox2 or Oct4. However, NPCs already express significant levels of Sox2, which might cause these cells to be more susceptible to reprogramming in the conditions mentioned above. This present study aimed at identifying small molecules that can enable reprogramming of MEFs, which do not express any of the TFs deemed necessary for reprogramming. It was fortuitous that we identified BIX in both the NPC and MEF screens, which further confirmed that this molecule has a role in enabling and improving the generation of iPSCs from somatic cells. Given BIX's characterized mechanism of action, our studies potentially identified a molecular target whose loss of function via pharmacological inhibition is sufficient to compensate for the gain of function of an essential iPSC reprogramming gene. It further mechanistically links a specific epigenetic process, inhibition of G9a-mediated H3K9me2, to iPSC generation. BIX may function to facilitate shifting of the epigenetic balance from a silenced state of pluripotency genes to an active transcription state for cell reprogramming. On the other hand, our observation that BayK, with a characterized activity as a specific L-type calcium channel agonist (Schramm et al., 1983Schramm M. Thomas G. Towart R. Franckowiak G. Novel dihydropyridines with positive inotropic action through activation of Ca2+ channels.Nature. 1983; 303: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), improves reprogramming efficiency is intriguing. L-type calcium channels are known to mediate intracellular processes in different tissues, such as blood pressure regulation, smooth-muscle contractility, insulin secretion, cardiac development, etc. (Tosti, 2006Tosti E. Calcium ion currents mediating oocyte maturation events.Reprod. Biol. Endocrinol. 2006; 4: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of L-type calcium channels by different agonists, including BayK, has been shown to induce intracellular signaling through CREB activation, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release, and change in cAMP activity. More importantly, some reports suggest that calcium might play a role in the control of mESC proliferation (Heo et al., 2006Heo J.S. Lee Y.J. Han H.J. EGF stimulates proliferation of mouse embryonic stem cells: involvement of Ca2+ influx and p44/42 MAPKs.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 290: C123-C133Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, in our hands, treatment of mESCs with 2 μM BayK alone or in combination with 1 μM BIX does not lead to a change in proliferation (Figure S2). Furthermore, treatment of OG2 MEF with 2 μM BayK alone or in combination with 1 μM BIX does not induce SOX2 expression (Figure S3). Needless to say, more work needs to be performed to dissect the precise mechanism by which BayK impacts the reprogramming process. However, it is interesting to find that a small molecule with activity in signaling pathways that have not been previously linked to reprogramming can significantly enhance its efficiency. So far, it is the first small molecule of its type to show an effect on reprogramming, as most of the other small molecules found up to date appear to directly modify the epigenetic status of the cell: i.e., BIX (Shi et al., 2008Shi Y.

Importantly, BayK seems to have several important characteristics that would be ultimately desirable for a molecule to be therapeutically relevant for in vivo reprogramming and/or regeneration. The fact that it does not act/reprogram on its own but needs the presence of BIX to exert its effects suggests that cells that are already undergoing a form of reprogramming, perhaps caused by injury, might be more susceptible to its effect. This might allow us to ultimately reprogram the target cell in a more specific manner, without impacting healthy cells systemically, as direct epigenetic modifiers might. In summary, we have identified a combination of two small molecules, BIX and BayK, that can enable MEF reprogramming into iPSCs in conjunction with the transduction of only two TFs: Oct4 and Klf4. This study further confirms the usefulness of a phenotypic screening approach in identifying small molecules that can effectively compensate for the viral transduction of a critical iPSC TF, such as Sox2. Ultimately, phenotypic small-molecule screens may lead to the identification of small molecules that will become powerful tools in providing us with new insights into the reprogramming process and may ultimately be useful to in vivo stem cell biology and therapy. 129S2/SvPasCrlf or ROSA26+/−/OG2+/− MEFs were derived according to the protocol reported on the WiCell Research Institute website: “Introduction to human embryonic stem cell culture methods” (http://www.wicell.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=category&id=310&Itemid=149&sectionid=16). Animal experiments were performed according to the Animal Protection Guidelines of the Max Planck Institute for Biomolecular Research, Germany. pMX-based retroviral vectors for mouse Oct4, Klf4, c-Myc, and Sox2 were obtained from Addgene (Cambridge, MA). The viral production and transduction process was performed as described (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

The synthesis and full characterization of compound BIX-01294 was as previously described (Kubicek et al., 2007Kubicek S. O'Sullivan R.J. August E.M. Hickey E.R. Zhang Q. Teodoro M.L. Rea S.

Cell. 2007; 25: 473-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), and Bayk8644 was purchased from EMD/Calbiochem Biochemical (San Diego, CA). For the primary and secondary screens, a collection of known compounds was used. This collection was composed of roughly 2000 known bioactive molecules that are commercially available, including FDA-approved drugs, known inhibitors and activators of characterized enzymes (the LOPAC collection from Sigma-Aldrich [St. Louis, MO]), Known Bioactive Library from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA), and nonoverlapping known compounds from EMD Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Primary 129S2/SvPasCrlf (primary screen) or ROSA26+/−/OG2+/− (secondary screen) MEFs were plated onto Matrigel (1:50; BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA)-coated dishes at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells per well of a 6-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, these cells were transduced overnight with defined retroviruses at 37°C, 5% CO2. Twelve to fourteen hours later, the media on the transduced cells were changed to mESC medium (knockout DMEM, 10% ES-qualified FBS, 10% knockout serum replacement, 1% Glutamax, 1% nonessential amino acids, penicillin/streptomycin, 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% EmbryoMax ESC Qualified Nucleosides [Millipore, Temecula, CA], and 103 U/ml LIF [Millipore]) (all products were from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, except where mentioned). On that same day, individual small molecules from our known drug collection were added to the cells at a range between 0.5 and 2 μM. Compound treatment was continued for 10–14 days; the cells were fixed and stained on day 14–21 using a standard ALP detection kit (Millipore). For the second screen, 1 μM BIX was added to the mESC medium 1 day after transduction. Five days later, in addition to 1 μM BIX, an individual small molecule from the known drug collection was added to each well, at a range between 0.5 and 2 μM. Mouse ESC media with defined small molecules were refreshed every 3 days until colonies with a similar morphology to mESCs were observed, which was usually between 14 to 21 days after transduction. In addition to the confirmed compounds as indicated in the text, primary hits from the second synergist screen that were not further followed up also include PD173074, reversine, 5′azacytidine, pluripotin, and dexamethasone. Further characterization studies and repeats were carried out either on primary 129S2/SvPasCrlf or ROSA26+/−/OG2+/− MEFs. When ROSA26+/−/OG2+/− MEFs were used, the iPSC colonies could also be identified through GFP expression, as a marker of Oct4 expression. Once iPSC colonies were identified, they were picked for expansion on MEF feeder cells in mESC medium. Some colonies were expanded in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 at concentration of 0.5–2 μM to further confirm their pluripotentiality. ALP staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using the Alkaline Phosphatase Detection Kit (Millipore). For immunofluorescence assay, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature (RT) and washed with PBS. They were then incubated in blocking buffer (BB) (0.3% Triton X-100 [Sigma-Aldrich], 10% normal donkey serum [Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc.] in PBS [Invitrogen]) 30 min at RT. They were then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°C in BB. Afterward, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody in BB for 45–60 min at RT. Primary antibodies were mouse anti-Oct4 (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-SSEA1 (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), rabbit anti-Nanog (1:500) (Abcam Inc., Cambridge, MA), mouse anti-Sox2 (1:200) (Millipore), rabbit anti-Pdx1 (1:200) (a kind gift from Dr. C. Wright), mouse anti-βIII-Tubulin (Tuj1) (1:500) (Covance Research Products Inc., Denver, PA), mouse anti-cardiac troponin T (CT3) (1:200) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA), and rabbit anti-albumin (DAKO). Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (1:500) (Invitrogen). Nuclei were detected by DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) staining. Images were captured using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-U/X-cite 120 EXFO microscope with a photometric CoolSnap HQ2 camera. RNA was extracted from iPSCs and control cell lines using the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit in combination with QIAshredder. The RNA was converted to cDNA using iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (BioRad, Hercules, CA). Amplification of specific genes was done using primers previously published (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

DNA from R1 cells, OG2 MEFs, and OK iPSCs (passage 10) was isolated using the Non Organic DNA Isolation Kit (Millipore). The DNA was then treated for bisulfite sequencing with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research Corp., Orange, CA). The treated DNA was then used to amplify sequences of interest. Primers used for promoter fragment amplification were as previously published (Blelloch et al., 2006Blelloch R. Wang Z. Meissner A. Pollard S. Smith A. Jaenisch R. Reprogramming efficiency following somatic cell nuclear transfer is influenced by the differentiation and methylation state of the donor nucleus.Stem Cells. 2006; 24: 2007-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The resulting fragments were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning Kit for sequencing (Invitrogen) and sequenced. iPSCs were aggregated with denuded postcompacted eight-cell stage embryos to obtain aggregate chimeras. Eight-cell embryos (B6C3F1) were flushed from females at 2.5 dpc and cultured in microdrops of KSOM medium (10% FCS) under mineral oil. Clumps of iPSCs (10 to 20 cells) after short treatment of trypsin were chosen and transferred into microdrops containing zona-free eight-cell embryos. Eight-cell embryos aggregated with iPSCs were cultured overnight at 37°C, 5% CO2. Aggregated blastocysts that developed from eight-cell stage were transferred into one uterine horn of a 2.5 dpc pseudopregnant recipient. One adult male chimera was mated with a female CD1 wild-type mouse. X-gal staining showed that six F1 embryos obtained from this natural mating of chimeric mouse and wild-type mouse were generated by germline transmission.

https://openalex.org/W2067626374,"Background Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is well known for its role in normal and pathologic neovascularization. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that VEGF also acts on non-vascular cells, both developmentally as well as in the adult. In light of the widespread use of systemic and intraocular anti-VEGF therapies for the treatment of angiogenesis associated with tumor growth and wet macular degeneration, systematic investigation of the role of VEGF in the adult retina is critical. Methods and Findings Using immunohistochemistry and Lac-Z reporter mouse lines, we report that VEGF is produced by various cells in the adult mouse retina and that VEGFR2, the primary signaling receptor, is also widely expressed, with strong expression by Müller cells and photoreceptors. Systemic neutralization of VEGF was accomplished in mice by adenoviral expression of sFlt1. After 14 days of VEGF neutralization, there was no effect on the inner and outer retina vasculature, but a significant increase in apoptosis of cells in the inner and outer nuclear layers. By four weeks, the increase in neural cell death was associated with reduced thickness of the inner and outer nuclear layers and a decline in retinal function as measured by electroretinograms. siRNA-based suppression of VEGF expression in a Müller cell line in vitro supports the existence of an autocrine role for VEGF in Müller cell survival. Similarly, the addition of exogenous VEGF to freshly isolated photoreceptor cells and outer-nuclear-layer explants demonstrated VEGF to be highly neuroprotective. Conclusions These results indicate an important role for endogenous VEGF in the maintenance and function of adult retina neuronal cells and indicate that anti-VEGF therapies should be administered with caution."
https://openalex.org/W2009393065,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) form descendants of all three germ layers when differentiated as aggregates, termed embryoid bodies. In vivo, differentiation of cells depends on signals and morphogen gradients that provide instructive and positional cues, but do such gradients exist in embryoid bodies? We report here the establishment of anteroposterior polarity and the formation of a primitive streak-like region in the embryoid body, dependent on local activation of the Wnt pathway. In this region, cells undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and differentiate into mesendodermal progenitors. Exogenous Wnt3a protein posteriorizes the embryoid body, resulting in predominantly mesendodermal differentiation. Conversely, inhibiting Wnt signaling promotes anterior character and results in neurectodermal differentiation. The activation of Wnt signaling and primitive streak formation requires external signals but is self-reinforcing after initiation. Our findings show that the Wnt pathway mediates the local execution of a gastrulation-like process in the embryoid body, which displays an unexpected degree of self-organization."

https://openalex.org/W2026589693,"Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection has been proposed as a possible risk factor of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) notably because it is neurotropic, ubiquitous in the general population and able to establish lifelong latency in the host. The fact that HSV was present in elderly subjects with AD suggests that the virus could be a co-factor of the disease. We investigated the risk of developing AD in anti-HSV immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive subjects (indicator of a lifelong infection to HSV) and IgM-positive subjects (indicator of primary infection or reactivation of the virus) in a longitudinal population-based cohort of elderly subjects living in the community.Cox proportional hazard models were used to study the risk of developing AD according to the presence or not of anti-HSV IgG and IgM antibodies, assessed in the sera of 512 elderly initially free of dementia followed for 14 years.During the follow-up, 77 incident AD cases were diagnosed. Controlled for age, gender, educational level and Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) status, IgM-positive subjects showed a significant higher risk of developing AD (HR = 2.55; 95% CI [1.38-4.72]), although no significant increased risk was observed in IgG-positive subjects (HR = 1.67; 95%CI [0.75-3.73]). No modification effect with APOE4 status was found.Reactivation of HSV seropositivity is highly correlated with incident AD. HSV chronic infection may therefore be contributive to the progressive brain damage characteristic of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2025505154,"The transcription factor Klf4 has demonstrated activity in the reprogramming of somatic cells to a pluripotent state, but the molecular mechanism of this process remains unknown. It is, therefore, of great interest to understand the functional role of Klf4 and related genes in ESC regulation. Here, we show that homozygous disruption of Klf5 results in the failure of ESC derivation from ICM cells and early embryonic lethality due to an implantation defect. Klf5 KO ESCs show increased expression of several differentiation marker genes and frequent, spontaneous differentiation. Conversely, overexpression of Klf5 in ESCs suppressed the expression of differentiation marker genes and maintained pluripotency in the absence of LIF. Our results also suggest that Klf5 regulates ESC proliferation by promoting phosphorylation of Akt1 via induction of Tcl1. These results, therefore, provide new insights into the functional and mechanistic role of Klf5 in regulation of pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2067064279,"Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) provide the foundation for spermatogenesis. In a manner comparable to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, SSCs colonize the niche of recipient testes and reinitiate spermatogenesis following microinjection into the seminiferous tubules. However, little is known about the homing mechanism of SSCs. Here we examined the role of adhesion molecules in SSC homing. SSCs isolated from mice carrying loxP-tagged beta1-integrin alleles were ablated for beta1-integrin expression by in vitro adenoviral cre transduction. The beta1-integrin mutant SSCs showed significantly reduced ability to recolonize recipient testes in vivo and to attach to laminin molecules in vitro. In contrast, genetic ablation of E-cadherin did not impair homing, and E-cadherin mutant SSCs completed normal spermatogenesis. In addition, the deletion of beta1-integrin on Sertoli cells reduced SSC homing. These results identify beta1-integrin as an essential adhesion receptor for SSC homing and its association with laminin is critical in multiple steps of SSC homing."
https://openalex.org/W2111397256,"Proteolytic processing of epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunits occurs as channels mature within the biosynthetic pathway. The proteolytic processing events of the α and γ subunits are associated with channel activation. Furin cleaves the α subunit ectodomain at two sites, releasing an inhibitory tract and activating the channel. However, furin cleaves the γ subunit ectodomain only once. A second distal cleavage in the γ subunit induced by other proteases, such as prostasin and elastase, is required to release a second inhibitory tract and further activate the channel. We found that the serine protease plasmin activates ENaC in association with inducing cleavage of the γ subunit at γLys194, a site distal to the furin site. A γK194A mutant prevented both plasmin-dependent activation of ENaC and plasmin-dependent production of a unique 70-kDa carboxyl-terminal γ subunit cleavage fragment.

Channel activation by plasmin is dependent on cleavage of the γ subunit at a site that is in close proximity to defined sites for prostasin- and elastase-dependent cleavage of the γ subunit (5Bruns J.B.

Urine protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (Pierce). Urine aliquots of 0.15 ml from five different lean control rats (see Fig. 7, lanes 1-5), containing between 0.12-0.32 mg of protein, and obese rats (see lanes 6-10), containing between 0.26-0.48 mg of protein, were separately concentrated 10-fold using ProteoSpin™urine protein concentration kit from Norgen BioTek Corp.

Samples (15 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4-15% gradient gel (Bio-Rad Criterion™ precast gel) under reducing conditions (10% β-mercaptoethanol) and analyzed by immunoblotting with goat anti-human plasminogen antibodies (American Diagnostica, Inc., Greenwich, CT) and rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. The S.E. for base line normalized currents was calculated by dividing the S.E. of the amiloride-sensitive current by the mean current. Unpaired Student's t test was used to determine significance between groups, with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Plasmin Treatment Increases Amiloride-sensitive ENaC Currents and Cleaves the γ Subunit—We and others have previously shown that ENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes is activated by furin-dependent cleavage of the α and γ subunits. Co-expression of ENaC and prostasin in oocytes further activates the channel by inducing cleavage of the γ subunit at a second site distal to the furin site (5Bruns J.B. Carattino M.D. Sheng S.

ENaC expressed in oocytes can also be activated by treating oocytes with extracellular proteases, such as trypsin or elastase (4Hughey R.P. Bruns J.B. Kinlough C.L. Harkleroad K.L. Tong Q.

To determine whether plasmin activates ENaC, whole cell currents in oocytes expressing mouse αβγENaC, with or without treatment with 10 μg/ml plasmin, were measured by TEV (Fig. 1). A time-dependent increase in whole cell amiloride-sensitive current was observed using TEV within 1 min, and the current continued to increase over 6 min (Fig. 1A), similar to the time course for activating ENaC by external trypsin (27Chraibi A. Vallet V. Firsov D. Hess S.K. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The current increase reached a maximum by 10 min and then remained stable for an additional 20 min (Fig. 1B). In the absence of plasmin treatment, whole cell currents remained relatively stable. Plasmin did not activate currents in non-injected oocytes (data not shown). Exposure of ENaC-expressing oocytes to plasmin (10 μg/ml) for 4 min significantly increased amiloride-sensitive ENaC currents by 1.95-fold (p < 0.005) (Fig. 1C). MDCK cells expressing epitope-tagged αβγENaC (α-Myc, β-FLAG, and HA-γ-V5) were treated with increasing amounts of plasmin (0, 3, 9, and 27 μg/ml) for 6 min to determine whether plasmin cleaves γ at a site distinct from that cleaved by furin. After plasmin treatment, surface proteins were biotinylated. Following serial precipitation with anti-V5 antibodies and streptavidin-conjugated beads, immunoblots were probed with anti-V5 antibodies (Fig. 2). Both the non-cleaved (93 kDa) and furin-cleaved (75 kDa) forms of γ were present at the cell surface in the absence of plasmin exposure. However, an additional band at 70 kDa was observed when cells were treated with increasing concentrations of plasmin. The size of the new fragment was consistent with plasmin cleaving γ at a site distal to the furin cleavage site at Arg143, and was similar in size to the prostasin-dependent cleavage fragment resulting from cleavage at RKRK186 (5Bruns J.B. Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Maarouf A.B. Weisz O.A. Pilewski J.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6153-6160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Oocytes expressing αβγENaC (α, β, and HA-γ-V5) were also treated with plasmin (0 or 10 μg/ml) for 4 min to determine whether plasmin cleaves γ at a site distinct from that cleaved by furin. After plasmin treatment, surface proteins were biotinylated and precipitated with streptavidin beads, and immunoblots were probed with anti-V5 antibodies. As observed with ENaC expressed in MDCK cells, both the non-cleaved (93 kDa) and furin-cleaved (75 kDa) forms of γ were present at the cell surface in the absence of plasmin treatment. The additional band at 70 kDa was observed when oocytes were exposed to plasmin (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3). Mutation of the Prostasin Cleavage Site Does Not Block Plasmin-dependent Activation of ENaC or γ Cleavage—The prostasin consensus site mutation γRKRK186/QQQQ blocks both ENaC activation by prostasin when co-expressed in oocytes and prostasin-dependent γ cleavage when ENaC and prostasin are co-expressed in MDCK cells (5Bruns J.B. Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Maarouf A.B. Weisz O.A. Pilewski J.M. Hughey R.P. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6153-6160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In contrast, we observed that ENaC containing γRKRK186/QQQQ was significantly activated 2.48-fold in oocytes exposed to 10 μg/ml plasmin for 4 min (Fig. 4). Plasmin cleavage of the γ subunit was also not affected by the γRKRK186/QQQQ mutation (Figs. 3 and 5). ENaC containing either wild-type γ or mutant γRKRK186/QQQQ was immunoprecipitated from transfected MDCK cells and subsequently treated with plasmin (20 μg/ml) for 0, 6, or 18 min. In both cases, immunoblot analysis revealed the non-cleaved (93 kDa) and furin-cleaved (75 kDa) forms of γ in the absence of plasmin (t = 0), whereas incubation with plasmin for 6 or 18 min revealed the plasmin-dependent 70-kDa fragment.FIGURE 5Plasmin cleaves the γ subunit at a site distinct from the prostasin cleavage site. MDCK cells were transiently transfected with α-Myc, β-FLAG, and either wild-type HA-γ-V5 (γ WT) or the HA-γRKRK186/QQQQ-V5 mutant. ENaC was immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-V5 antibodies from cell extracts, incubated with 15 μl of 20 μg/ml plasmin for 0, 6, or 18 min, and analyzed by immunoblotting (IB) with anti-V5 antibodies. Mobilities of the non-cleaved 93-kDa γ(γ93), furin-cleaved 75-kDaγ(γ75), and the new plasmin-dependent 70-kDa γ (γ 70) fragments are indicated to the right of the gels. An enhanced version of the banding pattern is shown in the lower panel and includes three parallel lines that denote γ93, γ75, and γ70.

Following plasmin treatment, surface proteins were biotinylated and precipitated with streptavidin beads, and immunoblots were probed with anti-V5 antibodies. As observed with αβγENaC, an additional 70-kDa band was observed when oocytes expressing αβγRKRK186/QQQQ were exposed to plasmin (Fig. 3A, lanes 6 and 7). Plasmin Activation of ENaC and Plasmin Cleavage of γ Are Blocked by the Mutation γK194A—The results of a microarray-based proteolytic profiling assay suggested that plasmin has a strong preference for cleaving after Arg or Lys when the preceding residue (at the P2 position) is an aromatic residue Phe or Tyr, in addition to His (i.e. FR, HR, YR, FK, HK, YK) (17Gosalia D.N. Salisbury C.M. Maly D.J. Ellman J.A. Diamond S.L. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with cleavage of the known and postulated substrates of plasmin (17Gosalia D.N. Salisbury C.M. Maly D.J. Ellman J.A. Diamond S.L. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The assay also provided data for preferred residues at the P3 position. Several of these preferred tripeptide sequences are present in the γ subunit: γPYK106, γIHK194, γWYK237, γSFK370, and γSFK476. On the basis of the plasmin-dependent 70-kDa form of γ, we predicted that plasmin cleaved at γIHK194, just distal to the prostasin cleavage site at RKRK186. To address this possibility, we examined whether plasmin could activate channels with a γK194A mutant. Whereas plasmin treatment of oocytes expressing wild-type ENaC significantly activated amiloride-sensitive currents, ENaCs containing a γK194A mutant were not activated by plasmin (Fig. 6). Consistent with this observation, we observed that plasmin treatment of oocytes expressing wild-type ENaC, but not ENaC containing the γK194A mutant, produced the plasmin-dependent 70-kDa fragment of γ when oocytes were exposed to plasmin (10 μg/ml) for 4 min (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 3 (wild-type γ) and lanes 4 and 5 (γK194A)). The non-cleaved 93-kDa and furin-cleaved 75-kDa forms of γ were present when ENaC with either wild-type γ or mutant γK194A was expressed in oocytes. We next examined whether plasminogen is present in the urine of rats with proteinuria. Urine was collected from obese, diabetic, and hypertensive ZSF1 rats and lean, nondiabetic, and hypertensive littermate controls. Obese ZSF1 rat urine contained 400 ± 52 mg of protein/kg/day (n = 5) compared with 53 ± 11 mg/kg/day (n = 5) for lean littermate controls (p < 0.0005). Equal volumes of urine were concentrated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with an anti-plasminogen antibody. Although plasminogen and plasmin L-chain were readily detected in the urine of obese ZSF1 rats, they were largely absent in urine from lean littermate controls (Fig. 7). Our data show that extracellular plasmin activates ENaC currents in oocytes. Channel activation by plasmin is dependent on cleavage of the γ subunit at or near Lys194. These observations are consistent with our proposed paradigm for the activation of ENaC by proteases, where activation occurs in a stepwise manner from (i) non-cleaved near silent channels to (ii) furin-processed channels that have an intermediate Po, and potentially to (iii) channels that have been cleaved by furin and a second protease and have a high Po (3Hughey R.P.

We propose that extracellular plasmin activates furin-processed channels by proteolytic processing of the γ subunit at γLys194 to release an inhibitory tract. Prostasin, elastase, kallikrein, and perhaps other proteases activate ENaC in a similar manner, by cleaving the γ subunit at a site distal to the defined furin cleavage site at γArg143, releasing an inhibitory tract (Fig. 3B) (3Hughey R.P.

In addition to activating ENaC, purified plasmin induces cleavage of ENaC expressed at the surface of both oocytes and MDCK cells. As purified plasmin also induces cleavage of immunopurified ENaC (Fig. 5), it is likely that plasmin directly cleaves the γ subunit and activates the channel. In addition to cleaving the γ subunit, it is possible that plasmin cleaves and activates other proteases that could process the γ subunit. Whereas plasmin may cleave the channel at other sites in addition to γLys194, the lack of ENaC activation with the γK194A mutant suggests that plasmin-dependent cleavage at the site is required for channel activation in oocytes. Whether plasmin cleaves the channel at other sites and whether cleavage at these additional sites would affect channel activity in other cell types are questions that we have not addressed. For example, γPYK106 is a potential plasmin cleavage site. If plasmin cleaves the γ subunit at both Lys106 and Lys194, it would potentially release the γ inhibitory tract we previously identified (5Bruns J.B. Carattino M.D. Sheng S. Maarouf A.B. Weisz O.A.

Plasmin-dependent cleavage and activation of ENaC may be particularly relevant in human disorders associated with proteinuria and extracellular volume expansion. The pathogenesis of renal sodium retention in nephrotic syndrome is unclear. Recent studies suggest that enhanced ENaC activity has an important role in the renal Na+ retention that has been observed in nephrotic syndrome (29Kim S.W. de Seigneux S. Sassen M.C. Lee J. Kim J.

Somatic cells can undergo epigenetic modifications and reprogramming through their fusion with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or after overexpression of a specific blend of ESC transcription factor-encoding genes. We show here that cyclic activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in ESCs with Wnt3a or the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) inhibitor 6-bromoindirubin-3'-oxime (BIO) strikingly enhances the ability of ESCs to reprogram somatic cells after fusion. In addition, we show that reprogramming is triggered by a dose-dependent accumulation of active beta-catenin. Reprogrammed clones express ESC-specific genes, lose somatic differentiation markers, become demethylated on Oct4 and Nanog CpG islands, and can differentiate into cardiomyocytes in vitro and generate teratomas in vivo. Our data thus demonstrate that in ESCs, periodic beta-catenin accumulation via the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway provides a specific threshold that leads to the reprogramming of somatic cells after fusion."

We investigated purinergic regulation of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in mammalian collecting duct. We find that ATP decreases ENaC activity in both mouse and rat collecting duct principal cells. ATP and other nucleotides, including UTP, decrease ENaC activity via apical P2Y2 receptors. ENaC in collecting ducts isolated from mice lacking this receptor have blunted responses to ATP. P2Y2 couples to ENaC via PLC; direct activation of PLC mimics ATP action. Tonic regulation of ENaC in the collecting duct occurs via locally released ATP; scavenging endogenous ATP and inhibiting P2 receptors, in the absence of other stimuli, rapidly increases ENaC activity. Moreover, ENaC has greater resting activity in collecting ducts from P2Y2-/- mice. Loss of collecting duct P2Y2 receptors in the knock-out mouse is the primary defect leading to increased ENaC activity based on the ability of direct PLC stimulation to decrease ENaC activity in collecting ducts from P2Y2-/- mice in a manner similar to ATP in collecting ducts from wild-type mice. These findings demonstrate that locally released ATP acts in an autocrine/paracrine manner to tonically regulate ENaC in mammalian collecting duct. Loss of this intrinsic regulation leads to ENaC hyperactivity and contributes to hypertension that occurs in P2Y2 receptor-/- mice. P2Y2 receptor activation by nucleotides thus provides physiologically important regulation of ENaC and electrolyte handling in mammalian kidney.

Consequently, body Na+ content is under tight negative-feedback control by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Discretionary Na+ reabsorption in the aldosterone-sensitive distal renal nephron, including the collecting duct, fine-tunes plasma Na+ levels.

ENaC is an end-effector of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with aldosterone increasing ENaC activity. The importance of ENaC and its proper regulation to control of blood pressure is highlighted by several diseases associated with gain and loss of ENaC function (3Bonny O. Hummler E.

For instance, gain of ENaC function results in inappropriate Na+ conservation and hypertension (e.g. Liddle syndrome).

The former are ligand-gated nonselective cation channels and the latter G protein-coupled receptors. Each mammalian P2 receptor family contains several receptor subtypes (P2Y1,2,4,6,11-14 and P2X1-7) that have distinct function and expression profiles, as well as distinct biophysical and pharmacological profiles (6Vallon V.

Solid experimental evidence documents the expression and function of P2Y2,4,&6 and perhaps P2Y1&11, as well as, P2X3-6, and possibly P2X1 in the mammalian collecting duct (5Hovater M.B. Olteanu D. Welty E.A. Schwiebert E.M. Purinergic. Signal. 2008; 4: 109-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Vallon V. Am. J. Physiol. 2008; 294: F10-F27Google Scholar, 8Schwiebert E.M. Kishore B.K.

Activation of luminal P2X receptors (likely P2X1&4) in the collecting duct promotes Ca2+ entry and mobilization in mice and rats (22Li L. Jeanette L.I. Zheng W. Cash M.N. Teng X. Wingo C.S.

Physiol. 1994; 267: F998-F1006PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of apical P2Y receptors (perhaps P2Y2) also promotes Ca2+ signaling, which, in some cases results in activation of Cl- channels, in mouse and rat collecting duct cells (11Wildman S.S. Marks J. Turner C.M. Yew-Booth L. Peppiatt-Wildman C.M. King B.F. Shirley D.G. Wang W. Unwin R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 12Jensen M.E.

Similarly, activation of P2Y receptors (possibly P2Y2) decreases the activity of luminal K+ channels in the mouse collecting duct (25Lu M. Macgregor G.G. Wang W. Giebisch G. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Previous work provides strong support for a role for P2 receptors in the regulation of Na+ reabsorption in the mammalian collecting duct (10Shirley D.G. Bailey M.A. Unwin R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: F1243-F1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Wildman S.S. Marks J. Turner C.M. Yew-Booth L. Peppiatt-Wildman C.M. King B.F. Shirley D.G. Wang W. Unwin R.J. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The prevailing consensus is that luminal P2Y receptors decrease amiloride-sensitive, electrogenic Na+ transport across this nephron segment. Because amiloride is a blocker of ENaC and activity of this channel is limiting for electrogenic Na+ reabsorption in the collecting duct, these findings point to ENaC as possibly being sensitive to P2Y signaling. Although the P2Y2 receptor has been proposed to be important in regulating amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport, firm evidence for this idea has not been available, in part, because of the limitation of available selective pharmacological agonists/antagonists for P2Y receptor subtypes. Moreover, the associated intracellular mechanism for regulation of Na+ transport is as-yet poorly defined. Similarly, ENaC in the mammalian collecting duct has yet to be definitively shown to be a target for ATP via P2Y signaling, and controversy surrounds which membrane contains the relevant P2 receptor in the regulation of Na+ reabsorption. To address these issues, we combined pharmacologic and molecular genetic approaches in which we studied P2Y2 receptor knock-out mice to directly test ATP regulation of ENaC with patch clamp electrophysiology using single channel analysis of ENaC in the isolated split-open collecting duct. We find that the P2Y2 agonists ATP and UTP rapidly and dynamically decrease ENaC open probability in principal cells in the rat and mouse collecting duct. Luminal P2Y2 receptors signaling through PLC are the primary arbiters of this action. Importantly, our results also provide compelling support for the idea that ENaC activity in the collecting duct is under intrinsic regulation by endogenous ATP tonically released from collecting duct epithelial cells. Loss of this regulation results in ENaC being hyperactive, thus likely contributing to the hypertensive phenotype of P2Y2-/- mice (30Rieg T. Bundey R.A. Chen Y. Deschenes G. Junger W. Insel P.A.

Materials—All chemicals and materials were purchased from Calbiochem, BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), or Sigma unless noted otherwise and were of reagent grade. The PI(4,5)P2 reporter, GFP-PLC-δ-PH, is a chimera consisting of the PI(4,5)P2-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain from PLC-δ1 conjugated to GFP. The cDNA encoding this reporter was a gift from T. Meyer (26Haugh J. Codazzi F. Teruel M. Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The immortalized mouse collecting duct principal cell line, mpkCCDc14, used in some experiments was a gift from A. Vandewalle (27Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells, which contain functional mineralocorticoid receptors and ENaC, readily polarize, forming monolayers with high trans-epithelial resistance and avid aldosterone-sensitive Na+ reabsorption. In brief, these cells were cultured in defined medium on permeable supports (Costar Transwells, 0.4 μm pore, 24-mm diameter) as described previously (27Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F.

Collecting Duct Isolation—The activity of ENaC in the apical plasma membrane of principal cells in isolated, split-open cortical collecting ducts from wild-type (C57BL/6) and P2Y2 receptor -/- (backcrossed and inbred onto a C57BL/6 background) mice was assessed directly with patch clamp electrophysiology. P2Y2 receptor -/- mice have been described previously (30Rieg T. Bundey R.A. Chen Y. Deschenes G. Junger W. Insel P.A. Vallon V. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3717-3726Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Likewise, isolation of collecting ducts suitable for electrophysiology has been described (29Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O.

Kidneys were cut into thin slices (<1 mm) with slices placed into ice-cold physiologic saline solution (pH 7.4). Collecting ducts were mechanically isolated from these slices by microdissection using watchmaker forceps under a stereomicroscope. Isolated cortical collecting ducts were allowed to settle onto 5 × 5-mm cover glass coated with poly-l-lysine. Cover glass containing collecting ducts were placed within a perfusion chamber mounted on an inverted Nikon TE2000 microscope and superfused for 2 min with a physiologic saline solution buffered with HEPES (pH 7.4) prior to experimentation. Collecting ducts were split-open with a sharpened micropipette controlled with a micromanipulator to gain access to the apical membrane. Collecting ducts were used within 1-2 h of isolation. Animal use and welfare adhered to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals following a protocol reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. In most cases, mice were maintained, for at least 1 week, on a nominally Na+-free diet ([Na+] < 0.01%, Harlan TEKLAD TD.90228) prior to experimentation. This dietary regimen increases ENaC activity (29Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Vandewalle A. Bugaj V. Stockand J.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 1652-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Li D. Wei Y. Babilonia E. Wang Z. Wang W.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F806-F812Google Scholar, 32Sun P. Lin D.H. Wang T.

For other experiments, such as the comparison between resting ENaC activity in wild-type and P2Y2-/- mice and experiments testing regulation by endogenous ATP, mice were maintained with standard chow (TD.7912) containing 0.32% [Na+]. Standard chow was used to set ENaC activity to resting levels in the absence of perturbed Na+ balance allowing comparison of ENaC activity in wild-type and knock-out mice under this control condition. Electrophysiology—Cell-attached patches were made under voltage-clamp conditions (-Vp = -60 mV) on the apical plasma membranes of principal cells in isolated, split-open collecting ducts from wild-type and P2Y2-/- mice using standard procedures (28Pochynyuk O.

Current recordings were made in a paired manner with a still bath where experimental reagents added sequentially were placed near the patch electrode (final concentration calculated using bath volume). Recording pipettes had resistances of 10-15 megaohm. Typical bath and pipette solutions were (in mm): 150 NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 5 glucose, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4); and 140 LiCl, 2 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4), respectively. Gap-free single channel current data from gigaohm seals were acquired (and subsequently analyzed) with an EPC-9 (HEKA Instruments Inc.) or Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments) patch clamp amplifier interfaced via a Digidata 1322A (Axon Instruments) to a PC running the pClamp 9.2 suite of software (Axon Instruments). Currents were low-pass filtered at 100 Hz with an eight-pole Bessel filter (Warner Instruments). Unitary current (i) and the number of ENaC in a patch, N, were determined from all-point amplitude histograms. Channel activity defined as NPo was calculated using the following equation: NPo = Σ(t1 + 2t2 +...ntn), where tn is the fractional open time spent at each of the observed current levels. Po was calculated by normalizing NPo for the number of channels observed within a given patch. Only patches containing five channels or fewer were used to estimate Po. Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) Microscopy—Plasmid cDNA encoding the PI(4,5)P2 reporter was introduced into mpkCCDc14 principal cells within a confluent monolayer with a biolistic particle delivery system (Biolistic PDS-1000/He Particle Delivery System; Bio-Rad). Use of this system has been described previously (29Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Vandewalle A. Bugaj V. Stockand J.D. J. Am. Soc.

After forming high-resistance monolayers that avidly transport Na+, cells were washed twice with physiologic saline, aspirated, and quickly bombarded (at the apical membrane) under vacuum with microcarriers coated with reporter cDNA. Medium was immediately returned to the cells, which were then placed within a tissue culture incubator for 2-3 days to allow expression of the PI(4,5)P2 reporter. Bombardment had little disruptive effect on cellular and monolayer integrity, as determined by maintenance of Na+ transport and a high trans-epithelial resistance. Fluorescence emissions from the PI(4,5)P2 reporter at the apical membrane of mpkCCDc14 cells within a confluent monolayer were collected using TIRF (also called evanescent-field) microscopy (36Taraska J.W.

Upon expression of the PI(4,5)P2 reporter, 5 × 5-mm sections of the support were excised, inverted, and placed onto cover glass coated with poly-l-lysine. All TIRF experiments were performed in the TIRF microscopy core facility housed within the Department of Physiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. We have previously described imaging the GFP-PLC-δ-PH reporter and other fluorophore-tagged proteins using this core facility (29Staruschenko A. Pochynyuk O. Vandewalle A. Bugaj V. Stockand J.D. J.

In brief, fluorescence emissions were collected using an inverted TE2000 microscope with through-the-lens (prismless) TIRF imaging (Nikon). Samples were viewed through a plain Apo TIRF ×60 oil-immersion, high-resolution (1.45 NA) objective. Fluorescence emissions were collected through a 535 ± 25 nm bandpass filter (Chroma Technology Corp.) by exciting GFP with an argon-ion laser with an acoustic optic tunable filter (Prairie Technology Inc.) used to restrict excitation wavelength to 488 nm. Fluorescence images were collected and processed with a 16-bit, cooled charge-coupled device camera (Cascade 512F, Roper Scientific Inc.) interfaced to a PC running Metamorph software. This camera uses a front-illuminated EMCCD with on-chip multiplication gain. Images were collected once a minute with a 100-ms exposure time. Images were not binned or filtered with pixel size corresponding to a square of 122 × 122 nm. Statistics and Data Treatment—All summarized data are reported as mean ± S.E. and compared with the Student's (two-tailed) t test. p ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. For presentation, current data from some cell-attached patches were subsequently software filtered at 50 Hz and slow baseline drifts were corrected. ATP Rapidly Decreases ENaC Open Probability—The first aim of this study was to assess the physiological regulation of ENaC by ATP, and other purinergic stimuli, in the mammalian collecting duct. Fig. 1, A and B, document the actions of 100 μm ATP on ENaC in native mouse collecting duct principal cells. As shown in the representative current trace in Fig. 1A, ATP rapidly and markedly decreases ENaC activity. As summarized in Fig. 1B, ATP significantly decreases ENaC open probability within 2 min from 0.50 ± 0.07 to 0.10 ± 0.05 (n = 12; n = 7 mice). Similar to the findings in murine collecting duct, we found that ATP rapidly and significantly decreases ENaC open probability in isolated, split-open rat collecting ducts (Figs. 1, C and D)(n = 9, n = 6 rats). Other nucleotides also decrease ENaC activity in collecting duct principal cells. Fig. 1, E and F, shows a representative current trace and summary graph (n = 12, n = 6 mice), respectively, documenting the inhibitory effect of 100 μm UTP on ENaC in the split-open mouse collecting duct. As shown by these paired experiments, UTP, similar to ATP, rapidly and significantly decreases ENaC open probability (from 0.52 ± 0.06 to 0.11 ± 0.02). These results are consistent with metabotropic (P2Y) purinergic receptors mediating inhibition of ENaC. To further test this idea, we next assayed the effects of ATP on ENaC in the presence of the P2 receptor antagonist suramin. Fig. 2A shows a representative current trace for a patch made on the apical membrane of a principal cell in an isolated, split-open collecting duct from a mouse. This patch contained a single ENaC. As is clear in this trace and in the summary graph in Fig. 2B of a series of paired experiments (n = 7, n = 5 mice), addition of 100 μm suramin in the presence of 100 μm ATP reversed decreases in ENaC open probability. Inhibition of purinergic receptors often increased ENaC activity above starting levels even in the continued presence of inhibitory concentrations of ATP. ATP Decreases ENaC Po via P2Y2 Receptors—We next probed which purinergic receptors transduce the inhibitory actions of ATP and UTP to ENaC. Because there is little evidence for P2Y12-14 receptors being in the collecting duct and these receptors do not respond to ATP, and because UTP, which does not stimulate P2X receptors, mimicked ATP actions, we focused our efforts on P2Y1,2,4,6&11. 3There are eight accepted P2Y receptors: P2Y1,2,4,6,11&12-14.

https://openalex.org/W2032811716,"In contrast to the classical view of development as a preprogrammed and deterministic process, recent studies have demonstrated that stochastic perturbations of highly non-linear systems may underlie the emergence and stability of biological patterns. Herein, we address the question of whether noise contributes to the generation of the stereotypical temporal pattern in gene expression during flower development. We modeled the regulatory network of organ identity genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana flower as a stochastic system. This network has previously been shown to converge to ten fixed-point attractors, each with gene expression arrays that characterize inflorescence cells and primordial cells of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels. The network used is binary, and the logical rules that govern its dynamics are grounded in experimental evidence. We introduced different levels of uncertainty in the updating rules of the network. Interestingly, for a level of noise of around 0.5–10%, the system exhibited a sequence of transitions among attractors that mimics the sequence of gene activation configurations observed in real flowers. We also implemented the gene regulatory network as a continuous system using the Glass model of differential equations, that can be considered as a first approximation of kinetic-reaction equations, but which are not necessarily equivalent to the Boolean model. Interestingly, the Glass dynamics recover a temporal sequence of attractors, that is qualitatively similar, although not identical, to that obtained using the Boolean model. Thus, time ordering in the emergence of cell-fate patterns is not an artifact of synchronous updating in the Boolean model. Therefore, our model provides a novel explanation for the emergence and robustness of the ubiquitous temporal pattern of floral organ specification. It also constitutes a new approach to understanding morphogenesis, providing predictions on the population dynamics of cells with different genetic configurations during development."
https://openalex.org/W2080052604,"We have characterized the positional specificity of the mammalian and yeast VIP/diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinase (PPIP5K) family of inositol phosphate kinases. We deployed a microscale metal dye detection protocol coupled to a high performance liquid chromatography system that was calibrated with synthetic and biologically synthesized standards of inositol pyrophosphates. In addition, we have directly analyzed the structures of biological inositol pyrophosphates using two-dimensional 1H-1H and 1H-31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Using these tools, we have determined that the mammalian and yeast VIP/PPIP5K family phosphorylates the 1/3-position of the inositol ring in vitro and in vivo. For example, the VIP/PPIP5K enzymes convert inositol hexakisphosphate to 1/3-diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate. The latter compound has not previously been identified in any organism. We have also unequivocally determined that 1/3,5-(PP)2-IP4 is the isomeric structure of the bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate that is synthesized by yeasts and mammals, through a collaboration between the inositol hexakisphosphate kinase and VIP/PPIP5K enzymes. These data uncover phylogenetic variability within the crown taxa in the structures of inositol pyrophosphates. For example, in the Dictyostelids, the major bis-diphosphoinositol tetrakisphosphate is 5,6-(PP)2-IP4 (Laussmann, T., Eujen, R., Weisshuhn, C. M., Thiel, U., Falck, J. R., and Vogel, G.

Our study brings us closer to the goal of understanding the structure/function relationships that control specificity in the synthesis and biological actions of inositol pyrophosphates. Signal transduction pathways frequently rely on a specific target protein recognizing a precise spatial arrangement of one or more phosphate groups on either another protein or a small metabolite. The six-carbon inositol ring offers what is arguably the most dramatic example of how even subtle modifications to phosphate topology can impart signaling specificity. The combinatorial manner in which phosphate groups can be arranged around the inositol skeleton creates a large family of phosphorylated molecules, many of which have individual, physiological roles (1Irvine R.F. Schell M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 327-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar).

These particular molecules regulate a diverse range of cellular activities, including phosphate sensing, actin cytoskeleton dynamics, apoptosis, vesicle trafficking, transcription, and DNA repair (see Refs. 4Bennett M. Onnebo S.M. Azevedo C. Saiardi A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 552-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar and 5Onnebo S.M. Saiardi A. Cell. 2007; 129: 647-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar for reviews). The different isomers of inositol pyrophosphates can be distinguished by biological receptors (6Lee Y.S. Huang K. Quiocho F.A. O'Shea E.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Lee Y.S. Mulugu S. York J.D. O'Shea E.K. Science. 2007; 316: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Thus, there is great interest in understanding the structure/function relationships of protein interactions with the inositol pyrophosphate ligands.Another reason to study the structure of the inositol pyrophosphates is to understand at a molecular level what factors dictate the positional specificity of the kinases and phosphatases that metabolize these polyphosphates. Furthermore, the structure of (PP)2-IP4 has additional significance, because it can impact the degree of the free energy change during its hydrolysis (8Hand C.E. Honek J.F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007; 17: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When one of the diphosphate bonds is cleaved, the ensuing relief of a portion of the electrostatic and steric congestion around the inositol ring will be substantially greater if the pyrophosphates in (PP)2-IP4 are vicinal (8Hand C.E. Honek J.F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007; 17: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This may have practical consequences; the higher the free energy of phosphate hydrolysis, the more thermodynamically favorable it becomes for the phosphate to be transferred to another cellular moiety (8Hand C.E. Honek J.F. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007; 17: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).In an earlier study (9Albert C. Safrany S.T. Bembenek M.E. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Bröker M. Shears S.B. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), chromatographic comparisons of lysates from mammalian cell lines with synthetic PP-IP5 standards indicated that 5-PP-IP5 was the major isomer to accumulate. It has, therefore, generally been anticipated that the enzymes that phosphorylate IP6 to PP-IP5 would be 5-kinases. One group of these enzymes (IP6Ks; Kcs1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was cloned by Snyder and co-workers (10Saiardi A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Snowman A. Tempst P. Snyder S.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1323-1326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 11Saiardi A. Nagata E. Luo H.R. Snowman A.M. Snyder S.H. J. Biol.

Recombinant versions of these enzymes were recently used to generate milligram quantities of PP-IP5 for analysis by one-dimensional (12Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and two-dimensional (13Draskovic P. Saiardi A. Bhandari R. Burton A. Ilc G. Kovacevic M.

The genes that encode this IP6 kinase activity have been identified in both S. cerevisiae (Vip1) (12Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A.

Indeed, the VIP/PPIP5K family appears to account for a distinct PP-IP5 kinase activity that was observed initially in experiments with cell lysates (17Shears S.B. Ali N. Craxton A. Bembenek M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10489-10497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Huang C.-F. Voglmaier S.M. Bembenek M.E. Saiardi A. Snyder S.H.

Signal. 2005; 17: 1533-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previous one-dimensional 31P NMR studies demonstrated that yeast Vip1 phosphorylates IP6 to a novel isomer of PP-IP5 that is different from the 5-PP-IP5 produced by recombinant human IP6K (12Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the isomeric nature of this new PP-IP5 isomer could not be unequivocally established by one-dimensional NMR (it was tentatively suggested to be 4/6-PP-IP5 (12Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)). One of the goals of the current study was to unequivocally determine the structure of this novel PP-IP5 isomer. This is a topic of current interest, because this new isomer regulates the transcriptional activity of a cyclin-cyclin kinase complex in S. cerevisiae (6Lee Y.S. Huang K. Quiocho F.A. O'Shea E.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 7Lee Y.S. Mulugu S. York J.D. O'Shea E.K. Science. 2007; 316: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).It was also our goal to address the lack of information concerning the position of the diphosphate groups on (PP)2-IP4. The structure of (PP)2-IP4 has previously only been determined in Dictyostelid cell extracts, since these organisms contain unusually high (300 μm) levels of this compound (20Laussmann T. Pikzack C. Thiel U. Mayr G.W. Vogel G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2447-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For example, two-dimensional 1H/31P NMR spectroscopy was used to demonstrate that the (PP)2-IP4 in Dictyostelium cell lysates has one diphosphate group at the 5-position and another at the 4/6-position (21Laussmann T. Eujen R. Weisshuhn C.M. Thiel U. Falck J.R. Vogel G. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Another of the Dictyostelids, Polysphondylium, also contains 4/6,5-(PP)2-IP4, plus relatively minor quantities (12-17% of total) of an additional isomer, namely 1/3,5-(PP)2-IP4 (22Laussmann T. Hansen A. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Vogel G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, it is considerably more challenging to analyze the structures of inositol pyrophosphates in yeast and animal cells, which typically contain only 1-2 μm concentrations of these compounds (23Ingram S.W. Safrany S.T. Barnes L.D. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 519-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As a consequence, the structure of (PP)2-IP4 in mammalian cells has not previously been determined.In the current study, we have developed a HPLC protocol to routinely identify the structures of the relatively low quantities of the inositol pyrophosphates that are present in most eukaryotic cells. Additionally, in experiments performed in vitro, we used recombinant kinases to generate sufficient quantities of (PP)2-IP4 for unequivocal structural analysis by two-dimensional NMR strategies. We show for the first time that yeast and mammalian VIP/PPIP5K enzymes are 1/3-kinases rather than having the 4/6-kinase activity that was tentatively proposed in an earlier study (12Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, the VIP/PPIP5K kinases phosphorylate IP6 to 1/3-PP-IP5. Finally, we demonstrate that VIP/PPIP5K enzymes act in concert with IP6K proteins to synthesize (PP)2-IP4 that has diphosphates at the 5- and 1/3-positions.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Synthetic PP-IP5 and (PP)2-IP4 Standards—5,6-(PP)2-IP4 and 1/3,5-(PP)2-IP4 were isolated from Dictyostelium and Polysphondylium, respectively, and then purified as previously described (22Laussmann T. Hansen A. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Vogel G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The synthesis of the 2,5-(PP)2-IP4 standard is described in the supplemental material. A mixture of PP-IP5 and (PP)2-IP4 standards was prepared by a slight modification of previously published procedures (24Mayr G.W. Radenberg T. Thiel U. Vogel G. Stephens L.R. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 234: 247-262Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 25Lin H.Y. Lindner K. Mayr G.W. Methods in Molecular Biology: Inositol Phosphates and Lipids. 2009; (Barker, C.

The pH was adjusted to 3.0 with HCl, and subsequently the mixture was dehydrated by overnight freeze-drying. The freeze-dried material was resuspended in 200 ml of water, and the mixture of PP-IP5/(PP)2-IP4 isomers were purified by Q-Sepharose chromatography.Preparation of Biological Isomers of PP-IP5 and (PP)2-IP4—Several different enzyme preparations were used to prepare inositol pyrophosphates for analysis by MDD-HPLC. In one series of experiments, (PP)2-[3H]IP4 was prepared from full-length recombinant forms of human FLAG-tagged VIP1/PPIP5K1 and, separately, from human FLAG-tagged VIP2/PPIP5K2, both of which were expressed and immunopurified as described previously (15Choi J.H.

The sample was centrifuged (12 min at 4,100 rpm), and the supernatant was passed through a 0.22-μm filter. The sample was then loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 column (GE Life Sciences) and run with the following gradient: 0-10 min, 100% buffer A (0.2 mm HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)); 10-40 min, linear gradient 0-100% buffer B (0.5 m HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)); 40-60 min, 100% buffer B. A flow rate of 1.0 ml/min was used, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The fractions that contained inositol phosphates were identified as described previously (12Mulugu S. Bai W. Fridy P.C. Bastidas R.J. Otto J.C. Dollins D.E. Haystead T.A. Ribeiro A.A. York J.D. Science. 2007; 316: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), neutralized with 5 m KOH, and lyophilized. The lyophilized product was resuspended in 1 ml of 99.96% D2O. (PP)2-IP4 for NMR analysis was prepared using recombinant GST-tagged ScVip1 kinase domain and full-length human IP6K1. In a 5-ml reaction, under conditions described above, 10 μmol of IP6 was incubated with 375 μg of GST-ScVip1 and 100 μg of GST-IP6K1 for 16 h at 37 °C. Samples were quenched, HPLC-purified, and resuspended in 1 ml of 99.96% D2Oas described above.NMR Analysis—NMR spectra were obtained at 300 K using a Varian Inova 500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a Dell Precision 390 work station and a 5-mm Varian probe. Proton and phosphorus chemical shifts are reported relative to external tetradeutero sodium propionate and undiluted H3PO4 at 0.00 ppm. The 2H signal of D2O was used as a field frequency lock.One-dimensional 500 MHz 1H NMR spectra were obtained with a 1600 Hz spectral window, a 45° pulse field angle (3.6 μs), a 6.4-s acquisition time, and a 1-s relaxation delay. The spectra were digitized using 20,484 points to obtain a digital resolution of 0.156 Hz/point. The HOD signal was suppressed by a selective presaturation pulse. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were plotted onto F2 and F1 of the 1H-1H two-dimensional spectra and onto F2 of the 1H-31P two-dimensional spectra. The HOD solvent signal reproducibly occurred at 4.784 ppm on the tetradeutero sodium propionate scale.1H-decoupled 31P NMR spectra were recorded at 202.3 MHz with a spectral window of 12,143.3 Hz digitized into 96,000 data points (digital resolution of 0.253 Hz/point), a 60° pulse flip angle (20 μs), and a 4.96-s total repeat time. Inverse decoupled difference spectra were recorded as 1H-detected 31P-decoupled heteronuclear NMR experiments, as previously described (27Ribeiro A.A. Zhou Z. Raetz C.R.H. Magn. Reson. Chem. 1999; 37: 620-631Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Zhou Z. Ribeiro A.A. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13542-13551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Metal Dye Detection (MDD) HPLC Analysis—MDD-HPLC was performed on a MiniQ PC 3.2/3 column (Amersham Biosciences) using a Kontron system (BioTEK) as described previously (29Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) with a slight modification to reduce analysis time and increase sensitivity. Thus, 1-5 nmol of a mixture of standards (see below) or sample was dissolved in 1-1.2 ml of 2 mm sodium acetate plus 2 mm NaF and injected using an autosampler (Kontron AS560). Two different gradients were employed in the current study by mixing buffer A (0.2 mm HCl, 15 μm YCl3) with buffer B (0.5 m HCl, 15 μm YCl3). Gradient 1 was as follows: 0-2 min, 3-45% B; 2-2.5 min, 45-58% B; 2.5-2.8 min, 58-59% B; 2.8-9 min, 59-65% B; 9-12.5 min, 65-80% B; 12.5-13 min, 80-100% B; 13-16 min, 100% B; and 16.1-20 min, 3% B. Gradient 2 was as follows: 0-1 min, 3% B; 1-2 min, 3-50% B; 2-2.5 min, 50-58% B; 2.5-3 min, 58-59% B; 3-10 min, 59-60% B; 10-10.6 min, 60-65% B; 10.6-13.5 min, 65-80% B; 13.5-17 min, 80-100% B; 17-18.5 min, 100% B; and 18.6-23 min, 3% B. The flow rate was 0.5 ml/min.The eluate from the column was mixed in-line with half of the volume of a buffer containing 300 μm 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol in 1.6 m triethanolamine (pH 9.0 with HCl), and the degree of the postcolumn complexometric reaction was recorded by measuring absorbance at 546 nm (SPD-10Avvp; Shimadzu). Data were stored in a polarity-switched format (multiplied by -1) and exported into Sigmaplot for imaging. All samples were routinely mixed with our mixture of standards (see above) and rechromatographed; in no case did this cause any changes to the elution time of any of the peaks in the standards. In some experiments (gradient 2 only), the YCl3 was omitted from the elution buffers; the 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol was replaced by water; and 20 s fractions were collected and mixed with 2 ml of INSTA-GEL scintillant (Packard), and radioactivity was determined using liquid scintillation spectrometry.Cell Culture and Extraction of Inositol Phosphates—NIH-Swiss 3T3 cells, H1299 cells, and MDA cells were all maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C on 15-cm Petri dishes to about 70% confluence. Cells were treated with either vehicle or 10 mm NaF for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into ice-cold lysis buffer (8% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm EDTA), followed by twice freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen. After no more than 30 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (3500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatants were extracted three times with 3 ml of water-saturated diethyl ether. After the pH had been adjusted to about 6 with Tris (0.5 m), the extract was concentrated in a SpeedVac.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPhylogenetic Differences in Inositol Pyrophosphate Structure—The ability to separate and quantify inositol phosphates and inositol pyrophosphates is critically important for understanding cellular metabolism and signaling regulatory networks. The recent increased interest in the biology of inositol pyrophosphates (4Bennett M. Onnebo S.M. Azevedo C. Saiardi A. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 552-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) has made it especially important to determine the structures of each species within this diverse array of molecules. For example, Albert et al. (9Albert C. Safrany S.T. Bembenek M.E. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Bröker M. Shears S.B. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) previously employed a MDD HPLC method for resolving different isomers of PP-IP5. We have now further developed the MDD-HPLC protocol for routine separation of (PP)2-IP4 isomers.To calibrate our chromatography system, a mixture of PP-IP5 and (PP)2-IP4 isomers were prepared in “shotgun” fashion from IP6 by a nonenzymatic, dehydration-driven transphosphorylation reaction that used creatine phosphate as a phosphate donor (see “Experimental Procedures”). This mixture was resolved by MDD-HPLC into eight different peaks that eluted after IP6 (labeled 1-8 in Fig. 1). There was some column-to-column variability in the absolute elution positions of the various peaks (compare A, B, and C in Fig. 1, which include data obtained at various times during a 4-year period). Nevertheless the elution pattern of our standard mixture was highly reproducible. Peak 1 contains 4/6-PP-IP5 and a leading shoulder of 5-PP-IP5, and peak 2 contains 1/3-PP-IP5 and 2-PP-IP5; these elution positions were verified by calibrating the HPLC system with chemically synthesized standards of each of these individual PP-IP5 isomers (9Albert C. Safrany S.T. Bembenek M.E. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Bröker M. Shears S.B. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Laussmann T. Hansen A.

J. 1997; 322: 31-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The remaining six peaks represent the elution positions of (PP)2-IP4 isomers. For example, we found that peak 7 in our mixture of synthetic standards (Fig. 1A) corresponded to the elution position of a two-dimensional NMR-characterized standard of 1/3,5-(PP)2-IP4 (from Polysphondylium (22Laussmann T. Hansen A. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Vogel G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)). Peak 3 (Fig. 1B) corresponded to the elution position of a standard of 5,6-(PP)2-IP4 (from Dictyostelium (22Laussmann T. Hansen A. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Vogel G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 30Laussmann T. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Vogel G. Biochem.

Peak 8 in our synthetic mixture corresponded to the elution position of a chemically synthesized standard of 2,5-(PP)2-IP4 (Fig. 1C; decomposition of this particular standard to PP-IP5 was noted).It has previously (12Mulugu S.

Thus, when IP6 was incubated with both human IP6K and ScVip1, three products accumulated (labeled peaks i, ii, and iii in Fig. 1D). Peak i co-eluted with the PP-IP5 product that was formed when IP6 was phosphorylated by human IP6K alone (data not shown; this material has previously been validated by NMR to be 5-PP-IP5 (13Draskovic P.

Peak ii co-eluted with the PP-IP5 product that was formed when IP6 was incubated with yeast Vip1 alone (data not shown); this PP-IP5 coeluted with a synthetic 1/3-PP-IP5 standard (data not shown), and in addition it was validated by NMR to be 1/3-PP-IP5 (see below). Peak iii contains the (PP)2-IP4 that was formed in these experiments, and this co-eluted with peak 7 of our standard mixture (Fig. 1D). This is also the elution point for a t"

MRAP is a single transmembrane protein that forms highly unusual antiparallel homodimers. We used molecular complementation to ask where MRAP achieves dual topology. Fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) were fused to the NH2 or COOH terminus of MRAP such that YFP fluorescence could occur only in antiparallel homodimers; fluorescence was present in the endoplasmic reticulum. MRAP retained dual topology after deletion of most of the amino terminus. In contrast, deletion of residues 31-37, just NH2-terminal to the transmembrane domain, forced MRAP into a single Nexo/Ccyt orientation and blocked its ability to promote MC2 receptor trafficking and homodimerize. When the transmembrane domain of MRAP was replaced with the corresponding region from RAMP3, dual topology was retained but MRAP was inactive. Insertion of MRAP residues 29-37 conferred dual topology to RAMP3, normally in an Nexo/Ccyt orientation. When expressed with MRAPΔ1-30, MRAPΔ10-20, or MRAPΔ21-30, MC2 receptor was localized on the plasma membrane but unable to respond to ACTH. Residues 18-21 of MRAP were critical; MC2 receptor expressed with MRAP(18-21A) localized to the plasma membrane but did not bind 125I-ACTH or increase cAMP in response to ACTH. A newly identified MRAP homolog, MRAP2, lacks amino acids 18LDYI21 of MRAP and, like MRAP(18-21A), allows MC2 receptor trafficking but not signaling. MRAP2 with an LDYI insertion functions like MRAP.

In familial glucocorticoid deficiency, patients are resistant to ACTH and unable to make sufficient glucocorticoids. Unless adrenal corticosteroids are replaced, the failure to respond to ACTH can lead to hypoglycemia, infection, and death. Some individuals with familial glucocorticoid deficiency (type 1) have inactivating mutations in the MC2 receptor (1Chan L.F. Clark A.J. Metherell L.A. Horm.

Genet. 2005; 37: 166-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), another group of patients with familial glucocorticoid deficiency (type 2) has mutations in a protein needed for MC2 receptor function, termed MRAP (melanocortin 2 receptor accessory protein) (1Chan L.F.

In the absence of MRAP, MC2 receptor is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lacks mature carbohydrate, and is rapidly degraded. In the presence of MRAP, MC2 receptor is glycosylated and localized on the plasma membrane, where it binds ACTH and activates adenylyl cyclase (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal and transmembrane segments of MRAP are strongly conserved, whereas the COOH-terminal domains are highly divergent and apparently nonessential. Two splice variants of human MRAP that differ completely in the region COOH-terminal to the transmembrane region (5Roy S. Rached M. Gallo-Payet N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and a truncated mouse MRAP lacking the entire COOH terminus (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MRAP forms a stable, immunoprecipitable complex with the MC2 receptor (4Metherell L.A. Chapple J.P. Cooray S. David A. Becker C. Ruschendorf F. Naville D. Begeot M. Khoo B. Nurnberg P. Huebner A.

The MC2 receptor is one of five melanocortin receptors, class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are coupled to G proteins and cause an increase in cAMP when activated (8Gantz I. Fong T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: E468-E474Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). ACTH is the natural agonist for the MC2 receptor, whereas the various melanocyte-stimulating hormone peptides bind with high affinity to all other melanocortin receptors. Most melanocortin receptors can be expressed in heterologous systems, but the MC2 receptor is not functional when expressed in commonly used model systems. The MC2 receptor is not unique in requiring an accessory protein for trafficking to the plasma membrane and signaling. For example, members of the large odorant receptor family cannot be expressed in heterologous cells without the co-expression of accessory proteins (RTPs or REEP) (9Saito H. Kubota M. Roberts R.W. Chi Q. Matsunami H. Cell. 2004; 119: 679-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) alter the ligand specificity and sometimes trafficking of a number of class B receptors (10Parameswaran N. Spielman W.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 631-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Sexton P.M. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Hay D.L. Udawela M. Christopoulos G. Christopoulos A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

These accessory proteins are all small proteins with single transmembrane domains; the RAMPs have an Nexo/Ccyt orientation, whereas RTP reportedly has an Ncyt/Cexo topology. Recent work suggests that RAMPs may interact with a much broader set of class B GPCRs than previously recognized (10Parameswaran N. Spielman W.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 631-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Sexton P.M. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Hay D.L. Udawela M. Christopoulos G. Christopoulos A. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4709-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). RAMPs are tightly coupled to their cognate receptors throughout the life cycle of the GPCR. We previously reported that MRAP forms antiparallel homodimers, and is found in both the Nexo/Ccyt and Ncyt/Cexo orientations in similar quantities. Both ends of epitope-tagged MRAP are expressed on the exoplasmic face of the membrane in heterologous cells (5Roy S. Rached M. Gallo-Payet N. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 1656-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and both ends of endogenous MRAP can be detected on the surface in adrenal cells (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Glycosylation sites inserted in either the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains of MRAP are utilized to roughly equal extents, further supporting dual topology of the protein (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Transfected MRAP forms antiparallel homodimers, or possibly higher order oligomers (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and endogenous MRAP runs at the size predicted for dimers on SDS-PAGE (7Cooray S.N.

The topology of MRAP may be unique among single membrane-spanning proteins. The remarkable structure of MRAP raises a number of issues. Is MRAP in a dual orientation throughout the cell? What regions of MRAP are important for dual topology? What regions are essential for MRAP functions? Here we show that MRAP forms antiparallel dimers in the ER, and identify distinct regions of the molecule responsible for dual orientation, MC2 receptor trafficking, and MC2 receptor signaling.

Surface Epitope Detection by Fixed Cell ELISA—To measure epitopes on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane, cells in 12-well plates were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 2% paraformaldehyde, washed, blocked in 5% milk in PBS, and processed for ELISA as described (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) using 1:5000 monoclonal anti-V5, anti-FLAG, and anti-HA antibodies. Total Epitope Detection by Fixed Permeabilized Cell ELISA—To measure total epitopes, cells in 12- or 24-well plates were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min with 2% paraformaldehyde, washed, blocked in 5% milk in RIPA (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, pH 8.0) and processed for ELISA as described (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) using 1:5000 monoclonal anti-V5, anti-FLAG, or anti-HA antibodies. mMRAP2 Cloning—Mouse MRAP2 (mMRAP2) was cloned from mRNA isolated from mouse adrenal glands, reverse transcribed, and amplified using a forward primer containing an NheI site on the 5′ end followed by the V5 epitope tag sequence and the first 24 nucleotides of mMRAP2 (5′-ATA TGC TAG CGC CAC CAT GGG TAA GCC TAT CCC CAA CCC TCT GCT CGG TCT TGA TTC TAC TTC TGC CCA GAG GCT GGC TTC TAA C-3′) and a reverse primer containing the end of the mMRAP2 sequence without the stop codon and an MluI site (5′-ATA TAC GCG TGT CCA GGT CTA TGC GTG ATG-3′). The product of the PCR was inserted in pCR2.1-TOPO. The natural NheI site within the mMRAP2 sequence was silently mutated using QuikChange Lightning and the following primers: sense (5′-GGA GGC CTG AGG AGG AAC TAG CCA GGT TCA TGA AG-3′), antisense (5′-CTT CAT GAA CCT GGC TAG TTC CTC CTC AGG CCT CC-3′). The resulting DNA was digested using NheI and MluI and inserted in-frame in a pCI-neo vector containing the 3× FLAG epitope sequence resulting in a plasmid coding for V5-mMRAP2-3Flag. Live Cell Imaging—Cells on glass coverslips were rinsed and incubated with primary antibodies at 1:100 in F-12 media with 20 mm HEPES and 5% goat serum for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and incubated with 1:100 secondary antibody and 3 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were Alexa 546 anti-mouse or Alexa 488 anti-mouse. For YFP fluorescence localization, CHO cells transfected with YFP-F1-V5-MRAP and V5-MRAP-YFP-F2 were incubated with 1 μm ER-tracker blue-white DPX for 15 to 30 min at 37 °C before imaging. Where noted, nuclei were counterstained with 3 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 for 5 min at room temperature. A Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with ×100/1.3 NA oil objective, Photometrics CoolSNAP ES camera, and appropriate filter sets from Chroma were used. Images were captured with Metamorph software from Universal Imaging and transferred to Powerpoint for labeling. Micrographs displayed in a group were exposed and processed identically. Surface Epitope Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed, incubated with 1:2000 immunoprecipitating antibodies (anti-V5 and anti-FLAG) in F-12 media with 20 mm HEPES and 5% goat serum for 2 h at room temperature, washed, and lysed for 20 min at 4 °C with 0.1% N-dodecyl-β-maltoside in PBS with protease inhibitors. Lysates were centrifuged and immune complexes collected with protein A/G beads at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times, suspended in loading buffer with 100 mm dithiothreitol, boiled 5 min, and centrifuged. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels from Lonza (Rockland, ME). Western blotting was performed as described (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). cAMP Assay—CHO cells in 12-well plates were incubated with 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine and vehicle or 100 nm ACTH in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 medium for 20 min at 37 °C. cAMP was assayed using the Assay Design (Ann Arbor, MI) cAMP EIA Direct kit or PerkinElmer LANCE cAMP assay kit. 125I-ACTH Binding—Cells in 12-well dishes were incubated for 20 min in binding buffer (Dulbecco’s PBS with 20 mm HEPES, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.5) and then for 1 h in 0.4 ml/well of binding buffer containing ∼120,000 cpm of 125I-ACTH. Dishes were placed on ice and cells washed three times with cold PBS, solubilized in 0.1% SDS, and quantified in a γ-counter. Data Analysis—All experiments were repeated a minimum of two times on different days in separate experiments. Points in ELISA are the mean and range of duplicate or mean ± S.E. of 3 to 6 determinations, respectively. Statistical significance of differences were analyzed by unpaired Student’s t test or analysis of variance with Dunnett’s post-test analysis. Subcellular Localization of MRAP with Dual Topology—We envision two general models to explain how MRAP assumes its novel dual topology. In one, MRAP is initially synthesized in two different orientations in the ER. In the other, MRAP first inserts in one orientation and a fraction of the protein subsequently changes topology, possibly in a later compartment. To assess MRAP topology at the microscopic level, we used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (14Kerppola T.K. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). We fused fragments of yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to either the NH2 or COOH terminus of MRAP (supplemental Fig. S1). If sufficiently close, the F1 and F2 fragments of YFP can interact to form a fluorescent molecule. Because the two fragments of YFP were fused to opposite ends of MRAP, and reconstituting the YFP requires the two fragments to be on the same side of the membrane, YFP fluorescence solely reports the antiparallel dimeric form of MRAP (Fig. 1A). Constructs also contained V5 epitope tags. As a control, we fused the split YFP fragments to the NH2 and COOH termini of RAMP3 (supplemental Fig. S1). RAMP3 is a single transmembrane accessory protein for certain other GPCRs that has an Nexo/Ccyt orientation even without its natural signal peptide (Fig. 3, below).FIGURE 3Amino acids 31 to 37 of MRAP are required for dual topology.

F, cells expressing MRAP-V5 and MRAP-Flag or equivalent constructs of MRAPΔ31-37 were lysed and anti-V5 or anti-FLAG antibody was added. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE and blots probed with anti-V5 or anti-FLAG antibody. G, cells were transfected with V5-RAMP3-Flag or V5-RAMP3(MRAP29-37)-Flag. NH2- or COOH-terminal epitopes on the surface of nonpermeabilized cells were detected by ELISA using anti-V5 or anti-FLAG antibodies. Overall expression of V5-RAMP3(MRAP29-37)-Flag was comparable with that of V5-RAMP3-Flag, but surface expression was lower. In panels B and F, data are normalized to surface expression of the NH2-terminal V5 epitope for each construct. *, p < 0.01 versus RAMP3 control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that the fusion proteins were functional, we expressed YFP-F1-V5-MRAP and V5-MRAP-YFP-F2 with HA-tagged MC2 receptor and then quantified MC2 receptor on the plasma membrane by a previously described ELISA (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) that detects only the cell surface epitope. MC2 receptor was not localized on the plasma membrane when expressed with RAMP1, used as a negative control, but was able to traffic to the cell surface when expressed with either of the split YFP-MRAP constructs or the combination of the two (Fig. 1B). Cells expressing MRAP fused to either the F1 (YFP-F1-V5-MRAP) or F2 (V5-MRAP-YFP-F2) fragments of YFP were not fluorescent, but surface staining of MRAP using the anti-V5 antibody confirmed that these two fusion proteins were expressed and present on the plasma membrane (Fig. 1C). Cells expressing both constructs displayed clear YFP fluorescence, providing strong evidence for the existence of MRAP as an antiparallel homodimer. YFP fluorescence partially overlapped with an ER marker (Fig. 1D), proving that the unique antiparallel structure of MRAP is already achieved in the ER. MRAP fluorescence was also observed on the plasma membrane. Fluorescence was not seen in cells co-expressing YFP-F1-V5-RAMP3 and V5-RAMP3-YFP-F2, consistent with the single orientation of RAMP3 (Fig. 1, A and C). In an additional control, we co-expressed YFP-F1-V5-MRAP with RAMP3 fused to YFP-F2 at the COOH terminus or V5-MRAP-YFP-F2 with RAMP3 fused to YFP-F1 at the NH2 terminus. The average YFP fluorescence intensity in cells expressing the two MRAP-RAMP3 pairs was less than 20% of the YFP intensity in cells expressing an MRAP-MRAP pair in the same experiment (p < 0.001) (supplemental Fig. S2). To determine whether MRAP can form parallel homodimers, we fused both fragments of YFP to the COOH terminus of MRAP. When V5-MRAP-YFP-F1 and V5-MRAP-YFP-F2 were coexpressed, no fluorescence was detected, showing that MRAP does not form parallel homodimers in which YFP fragments can interact (Fig. 2A). To demonstrate that association of YFP fragments does not force nonspecific dimerization, we expressed the MRAP-YFP fusion proteins with G protein-YFP fusion proteins, because we did not expect the G protein subunits to interact with MRAP on their own. We expressed YFP-F1-V5-MRAP with the G protein γ7 subunit fused to YFP-F2 or V5-MRAP-YFP-F2 with the G protein β1 subunit fused to YFP-F1. Neither of these combinations resulted in fluorescence. When Gβ1-YFP-F1 and Gγ7-YFP-F2 were co-transfected, however, YFP fluorescence was detected, confirming that those fusion proteins were expressed and formed Gβ1γ7 dimers (Fig. 2B). Structural Requirements for Dual Topology of MRAP—To establish what regions of MRAP are important for dual orientation, we made a series of deletion and replacement mutants along the length of the 127-amino acid protein (supplemental Fig. S1 and Fig. 3A). Deletion of amino acids 1 to 30, corresponding to most of the amino terminus, did not significantly alter dual topology, because both NH2- and COOH-terminal ends of the truncated MRAP were detectable on the extracellular side of the membrane (Fig. 3B). Likewise, MRAP retained dual orientation when its 23-residue transmembrane domain was replaced with the corresponding region of RAMP3, a single membrane spanning protein with an exclusively Nexo/Ccyt orientation (10Parameswaran N. Spielman W.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 631-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 11Sexton P.M. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Hay D.L. Udawela M. Christopoulos G. Christopoulos A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2006; 1070: 90-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Deletion of 64 of the 67 residues in the MRAP COOH terminus reduced the fraction of MRAP in an Ncyt/Cexo orientation by about half but did not eliminate dual topology (6Sebag J.A. Hinkle P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 20244-20249Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In contrast, deletion of residues 31-37 of the amino terminus (LKANKHS), just proximal to the transmembrane domain, forced MRAP into a Nexo/Ccyt topology, showing that this positively charged region is required for MRAP to be inserted in opposite orientations. The same result was obtained when MRAP lacking residues 29-37 was studied (data not shown). As a further test of orientation, we incubated live cells with antibodies against either NH2- or COOH-terminal epitope tags and analyzed staining by immunofluorescence microscopy. Both ends of intact MRAP were detected on the external side of the plasma membrane, but only the NH2-terminal epitopes of RAMP3, without a signal peptide, or MRAPΔ31-37 could be detected (Fig. 3C). MRAPΔ31-37 topology was also tested using the bimolecular fluorescence complementation protocol. As expected for a single orientation mutant, no fluorescence was detected when YFP-F1-V5-MRAPΔ31-37 and V5-MRAPΔ31-37-YFP-F2 were co-expressed in CHO cells (Fig. 3D). These findings corroborate the exclusive Nexo/Ccyt orientation of MRAPΔ31-37. Because the only N-linked glycosylation site in MRAP is Asn3 in the NH2 terminus and glycosylation can only occur on the luminal side of the ER, the side that eventually will face the extracellular space, we used glycosylation of MRAP at the plasma membrane as a marker of an Nexo/Ccyt orientation. MRAP or MRAPΔ31-37, tagged at the NH2 terminus with V5 and at the COOH terminus with FLAG, were expressed in CHO cells and MRAP on the cell surface was selectively immunoprecipitated by adding anti-V5 and anti-FLAG antibodies to intact cells. We added both antibodies to isolate all surface MRAP regardless of orientation. Immunoprecipitated MRAP was resolved by SDS-PAGE and the membrane immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3E). Cell surface MRAP was a mixture of glycosylated and nonglycosyated forms, indicating that it was present in both Nexo/Ccyt and Ncyt/Cexo orientations. In contrast, almost all of the MRAPΔ31-37 at the cell surface was glycosylated, confirming that this mutant has an almost exclusively Nexo/Ccyt topology. Because MRAP dimers are antiparallel, we hypothesized that MRAPΔ31-37, being exclusively Nexo/Ccyt, would not homodimerize. To test this idea, we co-expressed MRAPΔ31-37-V5 with MRAPΔ31-37-FLAG, lysed cells, and immunoprecipitated with either anti-V5 or anti-FLAG antibody. No MRAPΔ31-37-V5 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG and no MRAPΔ31-37-FLAG was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5, whereas a significant fraction of wild type MRAP-V5 was detected after anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and vice versa (Fig. 3F). These results all lead to the conclusion that the 31-37 region is necessary for dual topology and that dual topolgy is required for dimerization. To determine whether this small region of MRAP is sufficient to force dual topology, we inserted amino acids 29-37 of MRAP into the NH2 terminus of RAMP3 proximal to the transmembrane domain and deleted the RAMP3 signal peptide (supplemental Fig. S1). RAMP3 without signal peptide was in an Nexo/Ccyt orientation (Fig. 3G), as it is with its signal sequence. In contrast, both ends of RAMP3(29-37MRAP) were detected on th"

M.genitalium-infection was treated with 1 g of azithromycin and a test-of-cure (toc) was performed one month post-azithromycin. Response to azithromycin, and response to moxifloxacin (400 mg daily for 10 days) in individuals with persistent infection post-azithromycin, was determined.Of 1538 males and 313 females tested, 161 males (11%) and 30 females (10%) were infected with M.genitalium. A toc was available on 131 (69%) infected individuals (median = 36 days [range 12-373]). Of 120 individuals prescribed azithromycin only pre-toc, M.genitalium was eradicated in 101 (84%, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 77-90%) and persisted in 19 (16%, 95% CI: 10-23%). Eleven individuals with persistent infection (9%, 95% CI: 5-15%) had no risk of reinfection from untreated-partners, while eight (7%, 95% CI: 3-12%) may have been at risk of reinfection from doxycycline-treated or untreated-partners. Moxifloxacin was effective in eradicating persistent infection in all cases not responding to azithromycin. Patients with persistent-M.genitalium were more likely to experience persistent symptoms (91%), compared to patients in whom M.genitalium was eradicated (17%), p<0.0001.Use of azithromycin 1 g in M.genitalium-infected patients was associated with unacceptable rates of persistent infection, which was eradicated with moxifloxacin. These findings highlight the importance of follow-up in M.genitalium-infected patients prescribed azithromycin, and the need to monitor for the development of resistance. Research to determine optimal first and second-line therapeutic agents for M.genitalium is needed."
https://openalex.org/W2026807251,"Myc and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling are mutually antagonistic, that is Myc suppresses the activation of TGFβ-induced genes, whereas TGFβ represses c-myc transcription. Here, we report a positive role for Myc in the TGFβ response, consisting in the induction of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the activation of the EMT-associated gene Snail. Knockdown of either Myc or the TGFβ effectors SMAD3/4 in epithelial cells eliminated Snail induction by TGFβ. Both Myc and SMAD complexes targeted the Snail promoter in vivo, DNA binding occurring in a mutually independent manner. Myc was bound prior to TGFβ treatment, and was required for rapid Snail activation upon SMAD binding induced by TGFβ. On the other hand, c-myc downregulation by TGFβ was a slower event, occurring after Snail induction. The response of Snail to another cytokine, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also depended on Myc and SMAD4. Thus, contrary to their antagonistic effects on Cip1 and INK4b, Myc and SMADs cooperate in signal-dependent activation of Snail in epithelial cells. Although Myc also targeted the Snail promoter in serum-stimulated fibroblasts, it was dispensable for its activation in these conditions, further illustrating that the action of Myc in transcriptional regulation is context-dependent. Our findings suggest that Myc and TGFβ signaling may cooperate in promoting EMT and metastasis in carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W2057362433,"Background Education inequalities in cancer incidence have long been noted. It is not clear, however, whether such inequalities persist in the United States, especially for less common malignancies and after adjustment for individual risk factors. Methodology/Principal Findings Within the NIH–AARP Diet and Health Study, we examined the association between education and the risk of developing cancers in a prospective cohort of 498 455 participants who were 50–71 year old and without cancer at enrollment in 1995/96. During a maximum 8.2 years of follow–up we identified 40 443 cancers in men and 18 367 in women. In age-adjusted models, the least educated men (<high school), compared to those with the most education (post–graduate), had increased risks of developing cancers of the esophagus (RR: 2.64, 95%CI:1.86–3.75), head and neck (1.98, 1.54–2.54), stomach (2.32, 1.68–3.18), colon (1.31, 1.12–1. 53), rectum (1.68, 1.32–2.13), liver (1.90, 1.22–2.95), lung (3.67, 3.25–4.15), pleura (4.01, 1.91–8.42), bladder (1.56,1.33–1.83) and combined smoking–related cancers (2.41, 2.22–2.62). In contrast, lower education level was associated with a decreased risk of melanoma of the skin (0.43, 0.35–0.54) and local prostate cancers (0.79, 0.74–0.85). Women with the least education had increased risks of colon (1.60, 1.24–2.05), lung (2.14, 1.79–2.56), kidney (1.68, 1.12–2.54) and combined smoking–related cancers (1.66, 1.43–1.92) but a lower risk of melanoma of the skin (0.33, 0.22–0.51), endometrial (0.67, 0.51–0.89) and invasive breast cancers (0.72, 0.61–0.84). Adjustment for smoking and other risk factors did not eliminate these associations, except those for cancers of the head and neck, colon, and liver in men and kidney in women. Conclusions/Significance We found a higher risk of malignant disease, particularly smoking– related cancers, among those in the lowest educational attainment category. Only some of the educational gradient is attributable to smoking. The persistence of substantial education inequalities in cancer incidence poses a challenge for etiologic research and public health policy."

The UGT1 enzymes use UDP glucuronic acid as sugar donor to glucuronidate bilirubin (UGT1A1), estrogens, bile acids (UGT1A3), tertiary amines (UGT1A4), and numerous other drugs and xenobiotics including carcinogens and bioflavones (3Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar, 8Miners J.O. Smith P.A. Sorich M.J. McKinnon R.A. Mackenzie P.I. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 10Jin C.J. Miners J.O. Burchell B. Mackenzie P.I. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 2637-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The UGT2 family contains three members of the UGT2A subfamily and seven members of the UGT2B subfamily. With the exception of UGT2A1 and UGT2A2, which have identical C-terminal domains encoded by a shared set of five exons, all members of the UGT2 family are encoded by separate genes of six exons arrayed along chromosome 4q13 (6Mackenzie P.I. Bock K.W. Burchell B. Guillemette C. Ikushiro S.-i. Iyanagi T. Miners J.O. Owens I.S. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogen. Genomics. 2005; 15: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The UGT2 proteins also use UDP glucuronic acid as sugar donor to facilitate the elimination of androgens and many xenobiotics and waste products of metabolism. Although the UGT1 and UGT2 family members prefer UDP glucuronic acid as sugar donor, there are examples where other UDP sugars are used. These include the use of UDP glucose by UGT2B7 and UGT1A1 and the use of UDP xylose by UGT1A1 (11Mackenzie P. Little J.M. Radominska-Pandya A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Tang C. Hochman J.H. Ma B. Subramanian R. Vyas K.P. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2003; 31: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 13Senafi S.B. Clarke D.J. Burchell B. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, their activities with these alternate UDP sugars were always much less than that with UDP glucuronic acid. There is no evidence that UGT1 and UGT2 forms use UDP galactose or UDP N-acetylglucosamine. In contrast to the UGT1 and UGT2 families, which contain many members and which are primarily involved in xenobiotic metabolism, the UGT8 family contains only one member, UGT8A1, which has a biosynthetic role in the nervous system (6Mackenzie P.I. Bock K.W. Burchell B. Guillemette C. Ikushiro S.-i. Iyanagi T. Miners J.O. Owens I.S. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogen. Genomics. 2005; 15: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). UGT8A1 is encoded by a gene of five exons on chromosome 4q26 and catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP galactose to ceramide, an important step in the biosynthesis of the glycosphingolipids, cerebrosides, and sulfatides of the myelin sheath of nerve cells (14Bosio A. Binczek E. Le Beau M.M. Fernald A.A. Stoffel W. Genomics. 1996; 34: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The existence of the UGT3 family was first noted in 2000 after the analysis of databases assembled as part of the Human Genome Project. 4Presented in 2001 at the 10th International Workshop on Glucuronidation and the UDP Glucuronosyltransferases, Hyogo, Japan. This family contains two members, which were named UGT3A1 and UGT3A2 by the UGT Nomenclature Committee and which are encoded by genes of seven exons positioned adjacent to each other on human chromosome 5p13.2 (6Mackenzie P.I. Bock K.W. Burchell B. Guillemette C. Ikushiro S.-i. Iyanagi T. Miners J.O. Owens I.S. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogen. Genomics. 2005; 15: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the extensive studies on the function of the UGT1, UGT2, and UGT8 families, and despite much effort, the catalytic properties of the UGT3 family remain an enigma. In this study, we identify UGT3A1 as a UDP N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. cDNA Cloning and Expression—Human kidney and liver RNA (Stratagene) was used as template to synthesize first strand cDNA with the SuperScript™ first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The coding region of UGT3A1 mRNA (GenBank™ reference number BC068446) was amplified from this cDNA using the forward primer, 5′-AGTACTCGAGTGCTTCTGTGGAAGTGAGCATGGT-3′, and the reverse primer, 5′-AGTAGGATCCTCATGTCTTCTTCACCTTCCTGGC-3′. The forward primer contained an XhoI site for cloning (underlined) and the UGT3A1 initiation codon (in italics). The reverse primer contained a BamHI site for cloning (underlined) and the stop codon (in italics). PCR was performed in a volume of 20 μl with 200 ng of cDNA, 100 ng of the forward and reverse primers, and the DNA polymerase, Pfu Turbo (Stratagene). The cycling parameters consisted of one cycle at 95 °C for 1 min and then 34 cycles of 95 °C for 0.75 min, 61 °C for 0.75 min, 72 °C for 4 min followed by a single 10-min cycle at 72 °C. After electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, PCR products of the predicted size were excised and purified from the gel using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) and subcloned into the pCR2.1 shuttle vector (Invitrogen) for sequencing. DNA sequencing revealed that the UGT3A1 insert contained a T361G nucleotide change resulting in a C121G substitution. As Cys-121 is conserved in all mammalian UGTs, mutagenesis with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was performed to produce cDNA for the reference protein with a cysteine at position 121. Both UGT3A1 cDNAs encoding the Cys-121 and Gly-121 variants were then cloned into the pEF-IRESpuro6 expression vector, which contains a puromycin resistance gene (15Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Expression vectors containing UGT3A1 in either the forward or the reverse direction were transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells, and cell lines stably expressing UGT3A1 proteins were selected with puromycin (2 μg/ml). Expressed UGT3A1 was analyzed by Western blotting and enzyme activity assays. Production of Antibody—Antibody against UGT3A1 was prepared by using amino acids 57–102 as antigen. This region, which has the least similarity to corresponding regions in other UGTs, was amplified from the UGT3A1 expression vector by PCR with 5′-AGTAGGATCCGCATGCATCAGAGTGGAAAGTTTTTGA-3′ and 5′-AGTACTCGAGTCTTCCTTCGATATCCAATGCTGTTTCTATGTA-3′ as the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The forward primer contained a BamHI site (underlined) and an initiation codon (in italics). The reverse primer contained an XhoI site (underlined) and a factor Xa cleavage site. After digestion with BamHI and XhoI, the PCR product was cloned between the BamHI and XhoI sites of the pET23a bacterial expression vector (Novagen). Escherichia coli (BL21-DE3) was transformed with the vector and expressed UGT3A1 antigen, which now contains a His6 C-terminal tag encoded by the vector, was purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) and used to prepare antibody in rabbits. The specificity of the antibody for UGT3A1 and its lack of reactivity to UGT1 and UGT2 proteins were assessed by Western blotting (see Fig. 2). Western Blotting—HEK293T cells stably expressing UGT3A1 cDNA in the correct and reverse orientations were harvested in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 1 mm EDTA and lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles and aspiration through a 22-gauge needle. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay, based on the Bradford method (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and aliquots of 15 μg of lysate protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (17Udomuksorn W. Elliot D.J. Lewis B.C. Mackenzie P.I. Yoovathaworn K. Miners J.O. Pharmacogenet. Genomics. 2007; 17: 1017-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Following electrophoretic transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, UGT3A1 protein was detected with UGT3A1 antibody and a secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Immunocomplexes were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescent kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Quantitative PCR—The levels of UGT3A1 transcripts in a human tissue RNA panel composed of RNA from whole brain, heart, lung, kidney, testis, liver, stomach, duodenum, and colon (Stratagene) were quantified using a Rotor-Gene 300 (Corbett Life Sciences) thermal cycler. The forward and reverse primers specific for UGT3A1 were 5′-CTATGCTTCATCAGAGTGGAAAGTT-3 and 5′-GCTTAGCAAATAACTACATTGAGTCC-3′ which correspond to nucleotides 161–185 and 352–378 of UGT3A1, respectively. The cycling parameters consisted of one cycle at 95 °C for 15 min and then 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 15 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. Transcript copy number was determined using UGT3A1 plasmid as standard. At the end of 40 cycles, the integrity of PCR products was assessed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel with 100-bp DNA markers (New England Biolabs) as a reference to estimate molecular size. The DNA was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. Enzyme Assays—All glycosidation reactions were performed in a final volume of 100 μl containing 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 4 mm magnesium chloride, enzyme source (100 μg of HEK293T cell lysate), 250 μm aglycone substrate, and 2 mm [C-14]UDP sugar (0.1 μCi/mmol). To maximize detection of product, some assays were performed with 250 μm substrate and 0.1 mm (2 μCi/mmol) or 0.5 mm (0.4 μCi/mmol) [C-14]UDP sugar. The reactions were started with the addition of UDP sugar and incubations were performed at 37 °C for 1 h, and were terminated with the addition of 200μl of ethanol. After centrifugation to remove denatured protein, aliquots of supernatant were subjected to thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates (Baker Si250F) in chloroform:methanol:water:acetic acid, in the v/v ratio of 65:25: 4:2. Radioactive products were visualized and quantified by exposure to a Phosphor Screen, which was scanned with a Typhoon 9400 scanner (GE Healthcare). Standard curves with known amounts of C-14 UDP-sugar were constructed to quantify product formation. Initial experiments established assay conditions to give linear reaction rates with time and protein. Kinetic analyses were performed with ursodeoxycholic acid concentrations ranging from 0 to 250 μm and 2 mm UDP N-acetylglucosamine. Kinetic parameters were calculated by fitting experimental data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using EnzFitter (Biosoft). To confirm the presence of N-acetylglucosaminide, products formed after incubation with UGT3A1 were extracted with ethyl acetate and digested in citrate buffer (200 mm, pH 5) with Jack Bean N-acetylglucosaminidase (Sigma) at 25 °C for 16 h. Reductions in the amount of N-acetylglucosaminide were revealed by thin layer chromatography as above. Comparison of UGT3A1 with Other Human UDP Glycosyltransferases—UGT3A1 is a protein of 523 residues. As with other UGTs (18Mackenzie P.I. Hodgson E. Bend J.R. Philpot R.M. Reviews in Biochemical Toxicology. Toxicology Communications Inc., Raleigh, NC1995: 29-72Google Scholar), it contains a putative signal peptide and a C-terminal hydrophobic region consisting of 17 amino acids between an aspartate and a lysine residue. The signature sequence characteristic of the UGT superfamily and the dilysine motif involved in retention of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum are also present in the C-terminal half of the protein. A comparison with UGT1A1 as a reference illustrates these conserved features, despite the differences in exon/intron boundaries between the two proteins, which are only 40% identical in sequence (Fig. 1). As deduced from homology modeling and in some cases mutagenesis experiments, several residues important for substrate binding and catalysis have been identified in the UGT1 and UGT2 enzymes (19Patana A.-S. Kurkela M. Goldman A. Finel M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 604-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Miley M.J. Zielinska A.K. Keenan J.E. Bratton S.M. Radominska-Pandya A. Redinbo M.R. J.

Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 1054-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Based on UGT1A1 as the reference sequence, the histidine (UGT1A1, His-39), which is thought to deprotonate the acceptor group on the substrate and/or play a role in substrate selection, is conserved in UGT3A1 (His-35). The aspartate residue (UGT1A1, Asp-151), which is thought to stabilize the protonated histidine or be involved directly in proton abstraction, is replaced by a glutamate residue in UGT3A1 (Glu-145). Other residues, purported to be involved in binding substrate and UDP-sugar, are also conserved or subject to conservative replacement. These include the serine (UGT1A1, Ser-309/UGT3A1, Ser-302) and histidine (UGT1A1, His-372/UGT3A1, His-369) residues, which are suggested to form hydrogen bonds with the β-phosphate group of UDP, and the glycine/serine (UGT1A1, Gly-377/UGT3A1, Ser-374), which is thought to form hydrogen bonds with the α-phosphate of UDP. Other residues of the signature sequence that are considered to interact with the hydroxyl groups of ribose are also conserved (UGT1A1, Glu-380, Asp-396, Gln-397/UGT3A1, Glu-377, Asp-393, Gln-394). These features are illustrated in Fig. 1. Catalytic Properties of UGT3A1—UGT3A1 is synthesized in transfected HEK293T cells as a 53-kDa protein (Fig. 2) and catalyzes the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to the bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (Fig. 3A). The presence of N-acetylglucosaminide was confirmed by digestion with N-acetylglucosaminidase (data not shown). UGT3A1 displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics toward ursodeoxycholic acid with a Km of 49 μm and Vmax of 309 pmol/min/mg of protein (Fig. 3B). The N-acetylglucosaminidation of the primary bile acids, cholic acid (3α, 7α, 12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid) and chenodeoxycholic acid (3α, 7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid), and the secondary bile acid, deoxycholic acid (3α, 12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid) was not detected, whereas only trace amounts of activity toward other secondary bile acids, including lithocholic acid (3α-hydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid) and hyodeoxycholic acid (3α, 6α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanoic acid), were found (Fig. 3A). UGT3A1 had negligible activity with other UDP sugars including UDP glucose, UDP glucuronic acid, UDP galactose and UDP xylose (Fig. 4). HEK293T cell lysates contain a compound that is prominently galactosidated, but this compound is not a substrate of UGT3A1 as its galactosidation occurs in HEK293T cell lysates that do not express UGT3A1 (Fig. 4). In addition to ursodeoxycholic acid, UGT3A1 N-acetylglucosaminidates 17α-estradiol, 17β-estradiol, and the prototypic substrates of the UGT1 and UGT2 forms, 4-nitrophenol and 1-naphthol (Fig. 3A). Slight activity toward 4-methylumbelliferone was also observed.FIGURE 4UGT3A1-catalyzed glycosidation of ursodeoxycholic acid and 17α-estradiol. Various UDP sugars were used as co-substrates in the glycosidation of ursodeoxycholic acid and 17α-estradiol by lysates of HEK293T cells transfected with UGT3A1 cDNA in the forward (+) and reverse (–) orientations. An autoradiograph of the TLC plate containing the conjugated products and unreacted UDP sugar and/or its breakdown products from assays with 250 μm substrate and 0.5 mm [C-14]UDP sugars is shown. Equal amounts of radiolabeled UDP sugar (0.4 μCi/mmol) were used in each reaction.

These were the Cys-121 variant, whose catalytic properties are described above, and the Gly-121 variant. As the UGT3A1-Gly-121 variant is found to a significant extent in the human population, 5Data from the Reference SNP Cluster Report: rs3756669. it was also expressed in HEK293T cells. Two clones that expressed UGT3A1-Gly-121 protein (Fig. 2) were devoid of catalytic activity, even when assayed with ursodeoxycholic acid and 17α-estradiol as substrates, under conditions to maximize detection of product (data not shown). Distribution of UGT3A1—As demonstrated by quantitative PCR, transcripts encoding UGT3A1 were detected in human kidney and liver (Fig. 5). Small amounts of transcript could also be detected in stomach, duodenum, colon, and testes but were undetectable in heart, lung, and whole brain (Fig. 5). As with HEK293T cells, UGT3A1 transcripts were not present in other cultured cell lines such as HepG2, Caco-2, MCF7, and LNCaP (data not shown). The presence of UGT3A1 in the liver and kidney was also confirmed by Western blotting (data not shown). Although N-acetylglucosaminides of small molecular weight compounds including ursodeoxycholic acid have been reported previously, the enzyme involved was not identified (24Marschall H.U. Matern H. Wietholtz H. Egestad B. Matern S. Sjovall J. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 89: 1981-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 25Marschall H.U. Griffiths W.J. Zhang J. Wietholtz H. Matern H. Matern S. Sjovall J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1599-1610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we identify UGT3A1 as this enzyme and show that it is mostly expressed in the liver and kidney. Ursodeoxycholic acid is a low abundant secondary bile acid formed by the bacterial epimerization of the 7α-hydroxy group of chenodeoxycholic acid and appears to be of little physiological significance in the healthy adult. However, ursodeoxycholic acid is the only bile acid currently recommended for treating liver dysfunction in patients with cholestatic liver diseases and for dissolving gallstones (26Paumgartner G. Pauletzki J. Sackmann M. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. Suppl. 1994; 204: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Paumgartner G. Beuers U. Clin. Liver Dis. 2004; 8: 67-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It appears to be hepatoprotective, as it reverses hydrophobic bile acid hepatotoxicity by activating pregnane-X-receptor and inducing CYP3A4 (a bile acid-metabolizing enzyme) in primary human hepatocytes (28Schuetz E.G. Strom S. Yasuda K. Lecureur V. Assem M. Brimer C. Lamba J. Kim R.B. Ramachandran V. Komoroski B.J. Venkataramanan R. Cai H. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39411-39418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Dosage with ursodeoxycholic acid leads to profound changes in the composition of bile acids in bile and urine. For example, after daily treatment (10–15 mg/kg) for 2–3 weeks, 50% of the total bile acids in the serum, urine, and bile of gallstone patients consists of ursodeoxycholic acid when compared with 3–4% in untreated subjects (29Hofmann A. Hagey L. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2461-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Under these conditions of increased ursodeoxycholic acid load, the major metabolite in the urine appears to be the N-acetylglucosaminide, with the sugar attached to the 7β-hydroxyl group (25Marschall H.U. Griffiths W.J. Zhang J. Wietholtz H. Matern H. Matern S. Sjovall J. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1599-1610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Marschall H.U. Griffiths W.J. Gotze U. Zhang J. Wietholtz H. Busch N. Sjovall J. Matern S. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Hence UGT3A1, which catalyzes this reaction, is likely to be of major significance in these pathophysiological states of bile acid overload. UGT3A1 displays Michaelis-Menten kinetics with ursodeoxycholic acid (Km 49 μm, Vmax 0.31 nmol/min·mg of protein) and appears to prefer this bile acid, as other bile acids are either poorly N-acetylglucosaminidated or not N-acetylglucosaminidated. This is in agreement with previous work on unidentified hepatic and renal N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, which were specific for ursodeoxycholic acid and had little activity toward the primary bile acids, chenodeoxycholic acid and cholic acid, and the secondary bile acids, lithocholic acid and deoxycholic acid (31Matern H. Bolz R. Marschall H.U. Sjovall J. Matern S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The selectivity of UGT3A1 for ursodeoxycholic acid also reflects the situation in vivo. Only glucuronides and glucosides of other bile acids are detected, especially under conditions of impaired bile flow (32Matern S. Matern H. Farthmann E.H. Gerok W. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 74: 402-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 33Trottier J. Verreault M. Grepper S. Monte D. Belanger J. Kaeding J. Caron P. Inaba T.T. Barbier O. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 1158-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These include the glucuronides of chenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid, lithocholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and hyodeoxycholic acid. Chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid are mainly glucuronidated on their C-24 carboxyl group (34Ikegawa S. Okuyama H. Oohashi J. Murao N. Goto J. Anal. Sci. 1999; 15: 625-631Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), hyodeoxycholic acid is mainly glucuronidated at the 6α-position, and the other bile acids are glucuronidated on either a hydroxyl or a carboxyl group. UGT1A3 appears to be the major enzyme involved in the glucuronidation of the C-24 carboxyl group (chenodeoxycholic and lithocholic acids) (33Trottier J. Verreault M. Grepper S. Monte D. Belanger J. Kaeding J. Caron P. Inaba T.T. Barbier O. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 1158-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Gall W.E. Zawada G. Mojarrabi B. Tephly T.R. Green M.D. Coffman B.L. Mackenzie P.I. Radominska-Pandya A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, UGT2B4 and UGT2B7 preferentially glucuronidate hydroxyl groups on bile acids. The latter also mediates the glucosidation of hyodeoxycholic acid on the 6α-hydroxy group (11Mackenzie P. Little J.M. Radominska-Pandya A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to ursodeoxycholic acid, UGT3A1 also N-acetylglucosaminidates other compounds including 17α-estradiol. 17α-Estradiol is an endogenous steroid that is synthesized from the aromatization of 17α-testosterone in various tissues including the brain (36Toran-Allerand C.D. Tinnikov A.A. Singh R.J. Nethrapalli I.S. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3843-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although a poor ligand for the estrogen receptor and generally regarded as hormonally inactive, 17α-estradiol is as potent as 17β-estradiol in protecting neurons from oxidative stress (37Dykens J.A. Moos W.H. Howell N. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1052: 116-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 38McClean J. Nunez J.L. Exp. Neurol. 2008; 210: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that of the two β-estradiol stereoisomers, UGT3A1 preferentially conjugates 17α-estradiol. Although the site of UGT3A1-catalyzed N-acetylglucosaminidation of 17α-estradiol is unknown, it is likely to be the 17-hydroxyl, as only 17α-estradiol-17-N-acetylglucosaminides have been described to date (39Nakagomi M. Yamada K. Matsuki Y. Kurihara H. Suzuki E. Steroids. 1999; 64: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). The two β-estradiol stereoisomers are also glucuronidated (35Gall W.E. Zawada G. Mojarrabi B. Tephly T.R. Green M.D. Coffman B.L. Mackenzie P.I. Radominska-Pandya A. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 40Williams J.A.

Miners J. Finel M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 2307-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The 3-hydroxyl groups of both steroids are glucuronidated by UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A10, and UGT2A1, whereas their 17-hydroxyl is glucuronidated by UGT2B7. UGT2B4 shows specificity for the 17-hydroxyl group of 17α-estradiol (41Itaaho K. Mackenzie P. Ikushiro S.-i. Miners J. Finel M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2008; 36: 2307-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The relative importance of glucuronidation and N-acetylglucosaminidation in the metabolism of 17-estradiol remains to be clarified. As well as selectivity for substrate, UGT3A1 also appears to preferentially utilize UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as co-substrate, as glycosidated products with other UDP sugars were not detected under the assay conditions used. However, further studies with many substrates are required, as it is possible that UGT3A1 may glycosidate one or more compounds with sugars other than N-acetylglucosamine, as was observed with UGT2B7, which can glucuronidate many compounds, but can also selectively glucosidate hyodeoxycholic acid (11Mackenzie P. Little J.M. Radominska-Pandya A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using a commercial source of human tissue RNA, we initially cloned a UGT3A1 cDNA, which encoded a glycine at position 121. This corresponded to the only known polymorphism in the UGT3A1 coding region reported to date: a T361G nucleotide change resulting in a C121G substitution.5 As a cysteine at position 121 is conserved across all mammalian UGT1, UGT2, and UGT8 families, we reasoned that it is likely to be of functional significance. Support for this conjecture was provided by studies with UGT1A6, which showed that substitution of this cysteine (Cys-126 in UGT1A6) with serine or valine partially or completely inactivated the enzyme, respectively (9Senay C. Jedlitschky G. Terrier N. Burchell B. Magdalou J. Fournel-Gigleux S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1597: 90-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this work, we show that UGT3A1 containing a glycine at position 121 has negligible activity toward ursodeoxycholic acid and 17α-estradiol. The T361G nucleotide polymorphism is present in a homozygous state in about 20% of Asian and Caucasian populations but is absent in African Americans.5 As this polymorphism yields an inactive protein, the therapeutic use of ursodeoxycholic acid in Asians and Caucasians might be improved by dosage adjustments in patients homozygous for the G-allele. However, further studies are required to determine whether there is a relationship between N-acetylglucosaminidation and the therapeutic or toxic effects of ursodeoxycholic acid usage. The UGT3 family contains two members, UGT3A1 described above, and UGT3A2. As these two enzymes are 78% identical in sequence, it is likely that UGT3A2 is also an N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. However, the substrate and UDP sugar preferences of this UGT remain to be identified. In summary, we demonstrate that UGT3A1 is a novel UDP N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that appears to function primarily as a drug metabolizing enzyme in human liver and kidney. It is involved in the elimination of ursodeoxycholic acid, 17α-estradiol, and some other xenobiotics. The frequent presence of an inactivating UGT3A1 allele in the human population may have significant therapeutic and/or toxicological implications.

Introduction of four lipid glycosyltransferases from Acholeplasma laidlawii and Arabidopsis thaliana, synthesizing large amounts of two nonbilayer-prone, and two bilayer-forming gluco- and galacto-lipids, (i) restored the curvature stress with the two nonbilayer lipids, and (ii) diluted the high negative lipid surface charge in all AD93 bilayers. Surprisingly, the bilayer-forming diglucosyl-diacylglycerol was almost as good in improving AD93 membrane processes as the two nonbilayer-prone glucosyl-diacylglycerol and galactosyl-diacylglycerol lipids, strongly suggesting that lipid surface charge dilution by these neutral lipids is very important for E. coli. Increased acyl chain length and unsaturation, plus cardiolipin (nonbilayer-prone) content, were probably also beneficial in the modified strains. However, despite a correct transmembrane topology for the transporter LacY in the diglucosyl-diacylglycerol clone, active transport failed in the absence of a nonbilayer-prone glycolipid. The corresponding digalactosyl-diacylglycerol bilayer lipid did not restore AD93 membrane processes, despite analogous acyl chain and cardiolipin contents. Chain ordering, probed by bis-pyrene lipids, was substantially lower in the digalactosyl-diacylglycerol strain lipids due to its extended headgroup. Hence, a low surface charge density of anionic lipids is important in E. coli membranes, but is inefficient if the headgroup of the diluting lipid is too large. This strongly indicates that a certain magnitude of the curvature stress is crucial for the bilayer in vivo.

Both soluble and membrane proteins may critically interact with or respond to specific lipids, lipid domains, or global bilayer properties (1Ces O. Mulet X. Signal Transduction. 2006; 6: 112-132Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Membrane lipids have several general functions. (i) Forming the bulk bilayer with “liquid” chains and insulating properties. The major species tend to be zwitterionic or uncharged and with a smaller fraction of anionic lipids. (ii) Minor lipids constitute signaling molecules and/or identity tags for membrane vesicle traffic. (iii) Lipids are also potential structural/functional cofactors in membrane protein three-dimensional structures (2Lee A.G. Biochim. Biophys.

(iv) Specific lipids or lipid environments are required during folding of some membrane proteins (4Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W.

Maintenance of the liquid state and a certain lipid surface anionic charge density, or surface potential, is important and extensively regulated in most types of cells. Many bacteria, and several eukaryotic organelles also contain a significant level of polar lipid species that due to their smaller headgroup size (and often with no net charge) are prone to form nonbilayer (NB) 3The abbreviations used are: NB, nonbilayer; DAG, diacylglycerol; GlcDAG, glucosyl-DAG; GlcGlcDAG, diglucosyl-DAG; GalDAG, galactosyl-DAG; GalGalDAG, digalactosyl-DAG; GT, glycosyltransferase; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; CL, cardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol); alMGS and alDGS, GlcDAG and GlcGlcDAG synthases (glucosyltransferases) from A. laidlawii; 18:1c, oleic acid; 18:3c, linolenic acid; bis-PBPC, 1,2-bis-(1-pyrenebutanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; bis-PDPC, 1,2-bis-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; MPB, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl) biocytin; TM, transmembrane; TMG, methyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; PC, phosphatidylcholine; WT, wild type. aggregates. Such lipids increase chain ordering due to a closer lateral packing and increase the tendencies for monolayers to curl concavely, modifying the lateral stress profile (“curvature elastic stress”) of each monolayer (7Zimmerberg J. Kozlov M.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). These collective bilayer properties have been found important for protein function in vitro. The curvature bilayer stress seems to be an active and important regulatory mechanism in several bacteria (8Lindblom G. Brentel I. Sjolund M. Wikander G. Wieslander A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7502-7510Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Lindblom G. Oradd G. Rilfors L. Morein S.

However, introduction by genetic means into AD93 of an enzyme (alMGS) from Acholeplasma laidlawii (17Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikstrom M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that synthesizes substantial amounts of a “foreign” nonbilayer-prone lipid, glucosyl-diacylglycerol (GlcDAG) restored or improved several of the above cell properties (16Wikstrom M. Xie J. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Heacock P. Wieslander A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10484-10493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It was suggested that GlcDAG can substitute for PE in at least three ways: (i) provides an increase in NB-prone lipid and curvature stress; (ii) dilutes the high negative lipid charge density; and (iii) provides chemical properties similar to the PE headgroup. Especially the ability of both PE and GlcDAG to participate in hydrogen-bond networks was considered important (16Wikstrom M. Xie J. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Heacock P. Wieslander A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10484-10493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the GlcDAG strain correct membrane topology for the LacY and uphill transport function were indeed restored (18Xie J. Bogdanov M. Heacock P. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19172-19178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The “diluted” negative charge character of the E. coli wild type lipid bilayer surface is of primary importance for topogenesis of LacY (19Bogdanov M. Xie J. Heacock P. Dowhan W. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 925-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the lipid surface must be similarly diluted in the GlcDAG strain compared with the high negative surface charge density in AD93. In A. laidlawii bilayer curvature stress is tightly regulated by a consecutively acting enzyme (alDGS), adding a second glucose moiety to the NB-prone GlcDAG and yielding diglucosyl-DAG (GlcGlcDAG), which is a bilayer-forming lipid due to its substantially larger headgroup (20Vikstrom S. Li L. Karlsson O.P. Wieslander A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5511-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Edman M. Berg S. Storm P. Wikstrom M. Vikstrom S. Ohman A. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8420-8428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Together, these enzymes seem to form a robust feedback mechanism for controlling lipid bilayer global packing properties (22Alley S.H. Ces O. Templer R.H. Barahona M. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 2938-2954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Analogous features may operate in plant chloroplast thylakoids, dominated by the nonbilayer-prone galatosyl-diacylglycerol (GalDAG), followed by the bilayer-forming digalatosyl-diacylglycerol (GalGalDAG) (23Rivas E. Luzzati V. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 41: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The corresponding galactosyltransferases, as well as metabolic regulation of these lipids, have similarities to the A. laidlawii system (24Kelly A. Sedoud A. Storm P. Öhman A. Wieslander Å. Proceedings of the 17th Conference of Plant Lipids. Aardvark Global Publ. Co. Salt Lake City, UT2007: 25-31Google Scholar). However, plant lipids are strongly enriched in polyunsaturated acyl chains, to an extent not tolerated by A. laidlawii or E. coli (25Wieslander A. Selstam E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 901: 250-254Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hence, curvature features are analogous but bulk hydrophobic properties, and sugar orientation and inter-sugar bond positions, differ between the chloroplast and A. laidlawii glycolipid headgroups. In plants there also seems to be a correlation between curvature stress (i.e. balance GalDAG/GalGalDAG), and thermotolerance (26Chen J. Burke J.J. Xin Z. Xu C. Velten J. Plant. Cell Environ. 2006; 29: 1437-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or (water) drought stress (27Torres-Franklin M.L. Gigon A. de Melo D.F. Zuily-Fodil Y. Pham-Thi A.T. Physiol. Plant. 2007; 131: 201-210PubMed Google Scholar). By introduction of the four glycosyltransferases from A. laidlawii and Arabidopsis thaliana synthesizing the GlcDAG and GlcGlcDAG, and GalDAG and GalGalDAG pairs, respectively, into the PE-minus (AD93) clone, we intended to address two related questions for the importance of bilayer curvature stress in E. coli. (i) Is the improvement brought by the GlcDAG lipid in the PE-minus strain due to its nonbilayer (curvature stress) properties; or (ii) is it caused more by a dilution of the very high anionic lipid surface charge in this strain. Construction of E. coli Lipid Mutants—E. coli strain AL95 (pss93::kanR lacY::Tn9) was used as the host strain is unable to synthesize PE unless it is supplemented with plasmid pDD72 (pssA+ camR) (4Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Construction of AD93/pTMG3 (GlcDAG strain) and AD93/pDD72 was previously described (16Wikstrom M. Xie J. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Heacock P. Wieslander A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10484-10493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). AD93/pTMG3/pACYCT7DGS (GlcGlcDAG strain) was constructed from AD93/pTMG3 as follows. The ALdgs gene was excised from the pET15b-alDGS construct (15Rietveld A.G. Killian J.A. Dowhan W. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12427-12433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using restriction enzymes NdeI and HindIII and cloned into the vector pACYC-T7 (28Nakano Y. Yoshida Y. Yamashita Y. Koga T. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 162: 157-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The plasmid was then transferred into AD93/pTMG3 (GlcDAG E. coli strain) cells, and plated on LB-plates with 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The coding region of atMGD1 from A. thaliana was amplified without the N-terminal signal peptide by PCR using oligonucleotides PAK 78 (ga cat atg gga gga gtc gga tta tcg ag) and PAK 79 (ct gga tcc aga tta ggc agt gca aga gag). The PCR product was then cloned into the pTMG3 plasmid (16Wikstrom M. Xie J. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Heacock P. Wieslander A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10484-10493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), from which the ALmgs fragment had been removed. The entire coding region of atDGD2 from A. thaliana was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides PAK80 (gg cat atg acg aat cag cag gag caa cac) and PAK 81 (ctg gat ccg tca atc ttg ctt gcg agt att tgg). The PCR product was then cloned into the pACYC-T7-DGS plasmid (this study), from which the alDGS fragment had been removed. Where indicated these strains also carried the following plasmids: pLacY[13C or 205C], encoding ampicillin resistance and a cysteine-less LacY derivative (dependent on IPTG for expression) in which either G13 or H205 was replaced by cysteine (4Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); pTMG-LacY[13C or 205C], encoding ampicillin resistance, the GlcDAG synthase (alMGS) (constitutively expressed) and the respective LacY derivative carried in the previous plasmids (18Xie J. Bogdanov M. Heacock P. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19172-19178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar); pACYC-T7-DGS, encoding chloramphenicol resistance, and the GlcGlcDAG synthase alDGS (dependent on IPTG for expression). Growth Conditions—Bacteria were grown in LB broth containing 5 g/liter NaCl and 10 mm MgCl2 at 30 °C. Plasmids were maintained by supplementing growth media with 50 μg/ml ampicillin (or carbenicillin) and 20 μg/ml chloramphenicol, respectively. IPTG (1 mm) was present in all experiments with expression of GlcGlcDAG, GalGalDAG, or LacY. During growth with MgCl2, the cells were first grown overnight in 2 mm MgCl2 before they were inoculated to the same absorbance in the different media. LacY strains were cultured in LB medium lacking NaCl and containing 10 mm MgCl2. All determinations involving LacY were done on cultures that reached a similar final cell density of A600 = 0.5. Acyl Chain Determination—Lipid concentration and acyl chain composition were determined as fatty methyl esters by gas liquid chromatography. Overnight cultures were pelleted in glass tubes and lipid acyl chains esterified by 1 ml of 1 n HCl in methanol. An internal standard of methylated 15:0 was added and samples were incubated at 80 °C for 20 min. After cooling, 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl and 1 ml of hexane were added and samples were shaken vigorously and then centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 3 min. Hexane phase was transferred into a fresh glass tube and acyl chain methyl esters were concentrated by a N2 stream and measured on a gas chromatograph (Hewlett Packard model 5890; DB25 column). Peaks were compared with proper reference mixtures run identically. Acyl chain composition of the various glycolipids was also determined, after isolating the respective lipids by TLC and eluting them by chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Lipid Analysis—For radiolabeling the lipids, overnight cell cultures were inoculated into LB medium containing 0.2 μCi/ml [14C]acetic acid. After 24 h cells were harvested by centrifugation, and lipids were extracted from cell pellets by extensive stirring in chloroform/methanol (2:1) followed by centrifugation and a second extraction in methanol. The lipids were concentrated by evaporation, separated on Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Merck) in methyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, chloroform, methanol, 0.25% KCl (25:25:25:10:9, v/v) or chloroform, methanol, acetic acid (65:25:10, v/v/v), and visualized and quantified by electronic autoradiography (Packard, Fuji, or Bio-Rad imagers). Lipids were identified by mobilities relative to known standard lipids, and by a positive color reaction with orcinol or α-naphtol. Osmotic Stress Experiments—15-ml sterile falcon tubes were prepared with different concentrations of salts in LB containing 5 g/liter NaCl with 10 mm MgCl2 in a total volume of 5 ml. The same amount of cells (overnight culture) was inoculated in all samples, which were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C at 150 strokes/min in a water bath shaker. Absorbance at 600 nm was measured regularly. Light Microscopy—E. coli cell length distribution was viewed with a Carl Zeiss phase-contrast microscope. Cell lengths were determined by picking random viewing areas and measuring at least 200 cells by an eyepiece with a calibrated grading scale. Membranes were stained by adding 1 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) to overnight cultures and stirred for 3 h at 30 °C before washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Potential formation of intracellular membranes by alMGS in AD93/pTMG3 was compared with alMGS expressed from the strong T7 promoter in vector pET15b carried in E. coli BL21(DE3) (cf. Ref. 16Wikstrom M. Xie J. Bogdanov M. Mileykovskaya E. Heacock P. Wieslander A. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10484-10493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). On the microscope slides the cells were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 0.7% low-melting agarose. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope (rhodamine filter). Images were captured with a CCD camera (Sony), and Image Access 3.0 software (Imagic Bildverarbeitung AG). Membrane Permeability—Permeability of cell membranes was assayed by antibiotic sensitivity, using susceptibility test discs (Oxoid, England). All discs contained 30 μg of the antibiotics except for rifampicin, which was at 50 μg and polymyxin B, which was 35.7 μg. Equal amounts of cells were spread on LB agar plates before the discs were positioned. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 30 °C before measurements of growth inhibition zones. Pyrene Lipid Probes—Pyrene-labeled lipids 1,2-bis-(1-pyrenedecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (bis-PDPC) and 1,2-bis-(1-pyrenebutanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline (bis-PBPC) were from Molecular Probes. The lipid probes (in chloroform) were added to the lipid samples (before liposome preparation) to 0.1% (mol/mol). Preparation of Liposomes—Lipid mixtures of the desired composition or membrane lipid extracts solubilized in chloroform, methanol (2:1) (v/v) were dried under a stream of nitrogen (gas) and then under reduced pressure for more than 1 h. The dry lipids were hydrated in 500 μl of buffer (0.5 mm lipid concentration) containing 20 mm HEPES and 100 mm sodium maleate, pH 8, by repeated agitation with two glass beads during 45 min. Large unilamellar vesicles (100 nm) were made by 19 successive extrusions of the lipid dispersions through double 100-nm pore size polycarbonate filters (Whatman, UK) with a LiposoFast small volume homogenizer (Avestin, Ottawa, ON), as described (29Karlsson O.P. Rytomaa M. Dahlqvist A. Kinnunen P.K. Wieslander A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10094-10102Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Storm P. Li L. Kinnunen P. Wieslander A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Measurements—The liposome preparations (with probes) were diluted 20 times with 20 mm HEPES, 100 mm sodium maleate, pH 8, to 25 μm final lipid concentration, in a magnetically stirred 1 × 1-cm four-window quartz cuvette. After temperature equilibration at 25 °C, the samples were excitated at 344 nm and emission spectra were collected between 360 and 540 nm on a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorimeter (Jobin Yvon). Slits of 5 nm were used, and the signal was integrated over 0.2-s intervals. The ratio between the maximum emission by monomeric pyrene (Im) and by excimer complex formed by an exited pyrene and a ground state pyrene (Ie) was used as a measure of the chain order in the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer (31Sunamoto J. Iwamoto K. Kondo H. Shinkai S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1980; 88: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Xiang T.X. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 1108-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ratio Ie/Im was calculated as I480/I394 (bis-PDPC) or I480/I398 (bis-PBPC). Analyses were repeated several times, data from the series prepared and analyzed during the same day are shown. LacY Topology Determination—The substituted cysteine accessibility method applied to transmembrane (TM) domains (SCAM™), based on the controlled membrane permeability of the thiol-specific reagent 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl) biocytin (MPB), was used to probe the TM topology of LacY as previously described (4Bogdanov M. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2107-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 33Bogdanov M. Zhang W. Xie J. Dowhan W. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 36: 148-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of exposed cysteine residues in whole cells (periplasmic exposure) or only after sonication (cytoplasmic exposure) was detected using a Fluor-S™ MultiImager (Bio-Rad) after SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and Western blotting using avidin linked to horseradish peroxidase to detect biotinylated LacY. LacY Transport Function—LacY transport function was determined as previously reported (34Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 732-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Uptake of [14C]TMG (methyl-β-d-galactopyranoside) at a final concentration of 0.1 mm was determined in intact E. coli cells as a measure of energy dependent uphill transport function. Uptake of [14C]lactose (final concentration 0.4 mm) was determined in intact E. coli cells, which contained β-galactosidase, as a measure of energy independent downhill transport function. Lipid Engineering of E. coli—By inactivation of the pssA gene in E. coli otherwise wild type for phospholipid synthesis, the pathway for PE biosynthesis was completely blocked resulting in a mutant now dependent on Mg2+ for survival (11DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), see Fig. 1. By selective introduction of the genes for four lipid glycosyltranferases, clones synthesizing major neutral bacterial and plant glycolipids were obtained. The source of the enzymes and the foreign lipid produced are as follows: A. laidlawii, GlcDAG (1,2-diacyl-3-O-(α-d-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol) and GlcGlcDAG (1,2-diacyl-3-O-[α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→2)-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl]-sn-glycerol); and A. thaliana, GalDAG (1,2-diacyl-3-O-(β-d-galactopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol) and GalGalDAG (1,2-diacyl-3-O-[α-d-galactopyranosyl-(1→6)-O-β-d-galactopyranosyl]-sn-glycerol), respectively (Fig. 1). These lipids should yield varying curvature stress features due to their nonbilayer-prone and bilayer-forming packing characters (cf. Fig. 1). Furthermore, the differences in glucose and galactose headgroup properties (35Mannock D.A. McElhaney R.N. Curr. Opin. Colloid Interface Sci. 2004; 8: 426-447Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) will be revealed in the same cell type and with similar lipid acyl chains. Lipid Composition and Properties in Clones—Wild-type E. coli has approximately 75 mol % PE with the remaining fraction being primarily the anionic phospholipids PG (20%) and CL (5%). Strain AD93 (PE-minus) supplemented with the ALmgs gene synthesizes substantial amounts of GlcDAG; see Fig. 2A. Introduction of the ALdgs gene (on a separate plasmid) into the GlcDAG clone yielded GlcGlcDAG as the major lipid. In A. laidlawii GlcDAG is the acceptor substrate for GlcGlcDAG synthesis. Induction of the ALdgs gene to various extents only marginally affected the GlcGlcDAG amounts, rising from just below 50 mol % without inducer to slightly below 60% at 1 mm IPTG (data not shown). Individual glycolipid amounts above 60 mol % may not be achieved, because this never occurs in the natural A. laidlawii host and is rarely observed for other glycolipids in nature. Introduction of the atMGD1 gene into AD93 yielded slightly lower amounts of GalDAG than for the GlcDAG strain. However, introducing the atDGD2 gene to this new GalDAG strain produced higher amounts of GalGalDAG lipid with 1 mm IPTG induction (than with 0 mm). The lipid compositions of AD93 (PE-minus), GlcDAG, GlcGlcDAG, GalDAG, and GalGalDAG clones are shown in Fig. 2B. The foreign glycolipids all reached close to 50 mol %, or more. Also note the (i) increased cardiolipin content in all modified clones, (ii) strongly decreased PG amounts in the GlcGlcDAG strain, and (iii) decrease of CL in the GalDAG strain, respectively, as compared with the AD93 PE-minus host. The GlcGlcDAG strain also has more glycolipids and less anionic lipids than the GlcDAG strain. Growth without the normal NaCl supplement reduced GlcDAG in the GlcGlcDAG clone close to zero, whereas still maintaining a high GlcGlcDAG fraction, see Fig. 8 below.FIGURE 8LacY topology and transport activity as a function of lipid composition. A, strain AL95 carrying plasmids pTMG-LacY[13C] and pACYC-T7-DGS was grown (without NaCl at 30 °C) in the presence of [14C]acetate, antibiotics, and IPTG and the lipids analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, strains AL95/pDD72/pLacY[13C] (+PE), AL95/pLacY[205C] (-PE), or AL95/pTMG-LacY[13C or 205C]/pACYC-T7-DGS (+GlcGlcDAG) were grown and analyzed for topological organization of LacY by SCAM™ either before (-) or after (+) sonication (Son) of cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, strains AL95/pDD72/pLacY[13C] (+PE, open squares), AL95/pLacY[205C] (-PE, closed squares), AL95/pTMG-LacY[13C] (+GlcDAG, noted by X), or AL95/pTMG-LacY[13C]/pACYC–T7–DGS (+GlcGlcDAG, open circles) were grown and assayed for uphill transport of TMG (large panel) or downhill transport of lactose (inset). Uptake of substrate was normalized to nanomole per mg of cell protein. Note the minor fraction of GlcDAG lipid in A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of membrane lipid acyl chain composition (Table 1) revealed that all four glycolipids-containing strains had an increased content of unsaturated chains relative to the AD93 host with (PE-plus), and without (PE-minus), plasmid pDD72, where the GalGalDAG strain was the highest. All except the GlcDAG strain also had increased average acyl chain lengths. Acyl chain features were verified in the purified GlcDAG, GalDAG, GlcGlcDAG, and GalGalDAG lipid species (data not shown). The increased acyl chain unsaturation and length (Table 1) will increase the curvature stress somewhat, potentially to compensate for properties lost, but not fully restored by the foreign lipids. These chain features seem to be the major controllable parameters in vivo for E. coli lipid-bilayer curvature stress (36Morein S. Andersson A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G."

The substrate specificity of SusB, hydrolyzing not only α-1,4-glucosidic linkages but also α-1,6-, α-1,3-, and α-1,2-glucosidic linkages, is clearly different from other well known glucoamylases belonging to GH15. The structure of SusB was solved by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method with sulfur atoms as anomalous scatterers using an in-house x-ray source. SusB includes three domains as follows: the N-terminal, catalytic, and C-terminal domains. The structure of the SusB-acarbose complex shows a constellation of carboxyl groups at the catalytic center; Glu532 is positioned to provide protonic assistance to leaving group departure, with Glu439 and Glu508 both positioned to provide base-catalyzed assistance for inverting nucleophilic attack by water. A structural comparison with other glycoside hydrolases revealed significant similarity between the catalytic domain of SusB and those of α-retaining glycoside hydrolases belonging to GH27, -36, and -31 despite the differences in catalytic mechanism. SusB and the other retaining enzymes appear to have diverged from a common ancestor and individually acquired the functional carboxyl groups during the process of evolution.

Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, the genome of which has been fully sequenced (1Xu J. Bjursell M. Himrod J. Deng S. Carmichael L. Chiang H. Hooper L. Gordon J. Science. 2003; 299: 2074-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar), is a bacterial symbiont that is a dominant member of the intestinal microbiota of humans and other mammals. The number of glycoside hydrolases encoded by B. thetaiotaomicron is much greater than reported for any other sequenced bacterium (2Comstock L. Coyne M. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), in accordance with the fact that this bacterium is known to salvage energy from nutrients, particularly carbohydrates, which are otherwise nondigestible by the host. According to CAZy (3Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2589) Google Scholar, 4Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 5Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 695-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar), the genome of B. thetaiotaomicron encodes 230 glycoside hydrolases. The B. thetaiotaomicron proteome includes 172 glycoside hydrolases, 163 outer membrane polysaccharide-binding proteins, and 20 sugar-specific transporters (2Comstock L. Coyne M. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 926-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Therefore, studies regarding these enzymes may lead to the discovery of new enzymatic specificities and contribute to the development of enzyme chemistry.The well known polysaccharide utilization system of B. thetaiotaomicron is the starch utilization system (sus) operon (6Hooper L. Midtvedt T. Gordon J. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2002; 22: 283-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). The sus operon contains transcriptional regulator (SusR) (7Cho K. Cho D. Wang G. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7198-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8D'Elia J. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7180-7186Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and seven genes, the products of which are involved in binding (SusC–F) (9Reeves A. Wang G. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and hydrolyzing (SusA, -B, and -G) starch (10D'Elia J. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7173-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses indicated that SusC and SusD are required for starch binding in the outer membrane of the bacterium. SusE and SusF are dispensable for starch utilization, but they contribute to stabilization of the starch-binding complex. SusA and SusG show similarity with neopullulanases, which are typical starch-hydrolyzing enzymes. Disruption of susA and susG markedly influences the growth rate of B. thetaiotaomicron (10D'Elia J. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7173-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 11Smith K. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2962-2968Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

These enzymes hydrolyze α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucosidic linkages, of the substrates such as amylose, pullulan, and cyclomaltodextrins, and also catalyze transglycosylation to form α-1,4- and α-1,6-glucosidic linkages.Much less is known about the biochemical characteristics of SusB, i.e. neither its three-dimensional structure nor its catalytic properties are known. SusB has been reported to function in the breakdown of oligosaccharides released by SusA and SusG into glucose units (10D'Elia J. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7173-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Disruption of susB showed no residual α-glucoside hydrolase activity in the cell-free extract (10D'Elia J. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7173-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The molecular mass (80 kDa) and pI (5.7) of a partially purified enzyme with α-glucoside hydrolase activity from B. thetaiotaomicron was close to the molecular mass of 84 kDa and pI of 6.0 estimated from the amino acid sequence of SusB. Therefore, SusB has been regarded as an α-glucosidase (10D'Elia J. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7173-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, α-glucoside hydrolases are definitively divided into two groups of enzymes, α-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.20) and glucoamylases (EC 3.2.1.3), which have different catalytic mechanisms; α-glucosidases hydrolyze α-glucosidic linkages with a retaining mechanism, whereas glucoamylases hydrolyze these linkages with an inverting mechanism. Moreover, SusB has no significant sequence similarity to any known α-glucosidases belonging to GH4, -13, or -31, or to glucoamylases belonging to GH15 or -63. The catalytic mechanism of action of SusB is still unclear. Recently, it has been experimentally clarified that a sequence homolog of SusB from Tannerella forsythensis (Bacteroides forsythus), with 83% similarity and 71% identity, has the ability to hydrolyze 4-methylumbelliferyl α-d-glucoside (17Hughes C. Malki G. Loo C. Tanner A. Ganeshkumar N. Oral Microbiol. Immunol. 2003; 18: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on this study, a new glycoside hydrolase family, GH97, was created by CAZy, and 77 sequences including SusB are now categorized as members.In this study, we clarified the enzymatic characteristics of SusB from B. thetaiotaomicron, which indicated it to be an inverting α-glucoside hydrolase. The three-dimensional structures of free and acarbose-bound SusB have also been determined at 1.6 Å resolution as a first structure of GH97 family. The structure revealed not only the catalytic mechanism but also molecular evolution of this enzyme; SusB shows considerable structural similarity with α-retaining glycosidases even though it catalyzes hydrolysis by an inverting mechanism. Furthermore, we discovered that GH97 family includes both retaining and inverting enzymes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29148 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Isomaltose, kojibiose, and nigerose were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals Co. (Osaka, Japan). Malto-oligosaccharides were purchased from Nihon Shokuhin Kako Co. (Tokyo, Japan). p-Nitrophenyl α-glucopyranoside was obtained from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan).Expression of SusB and Mutants—The gene encoding susB (GenBank™ accession number NC_004663) was amplified from the genomic DNA of B. thetaiotaomicron by PCR using the following oligonucleotides: 5′ forward primer 5′-ATA AAT AGA ATG AAA AAG AGA AAG ATT T-3′ and 3′ reverse primer 5′-GTT ATT TCT TTT CCT TAT TAT AAT CTT TTC-3′. PCR amplification was performed for 25 cycles using following conditions: 94 °C, 30 s; 50 °C, 30 s; 74 °C, 2 min. PCR product was used as a template for the next PCR introducing NdeI and XhoI recognition sites. PCR was performed for 25 cycles using following conditions: 98 °C, 10 s; 50 °C, 2 s; 74 °C, 2 min, using the primers listed in Table 1. The resultant DNA fragment was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated with pET28a (Novagen, Madison, WI), prior to digestion with NdeI and XhoI. After sequence analysis, a clone without any PCR errors was designated as psusBET28a encoding the SusB protein with His6 and linker sequence at its N terminus (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM) instead of the predicted signal sequence (1MKKRKILSLIAFLCISFIANA21). The constructed expression vector psusBET28a was transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen), and positive colonies were selected. The transformant was first inoculated into 30 ml of LB media containing 30 μgml-1 kanamycin and 50 μgml-1 chloramphenicol at 37 °C with shaking. This overnight culture was diluted in 300 ml of LB media containing 30 μgml-1 kanamycin and further grown at 37 °C up to an A600 of ∼0.7, and then protein production was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 14 h at 37 °C. The induced cells were centrifuged at 10,000 × g, and the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole), including 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by sonication. The sonicated lysates were cloned and amplified by overlap extension PCR using the primers listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Primers used for cloning and mutagenesis of SusB NdeI and XhoI sites are underlined.CompoundsPrimersWild typeForward, ATTGCGCATATGCAACAGAAATTAACCTCAReverse, TTTTCCCTCGAGTTATAATCTTTTCAAE508QForward, ATGGTGAATGCACACCAAGCAACCCGCCCTACCReverse, GGTAGGGCGGGTTGCTTGGTGTGCATTCACCATE532QForward, TCCGCCCGCGGTACACAATATGAATCATTCGGAReverse, TCCGAATGATTCATATTGTGTACCGCGGGCGGAE439QForward, ATGATGATGCATCACCAAACTTCCGCTTCTGTAReverse, TACAGAAGCGGAAGTTTGGTGATGCATCATCAT Open table in a new tab Purification of SusB and Mutants—The cell-free extract was applied to 7.5 ml of a nickel-chelating Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Biosciences), prepared in accordance with the supplier's manual, and equilibrated with buffer A. After the column was washed with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) containing 20 mm imidazole, the absorbed fractions were eluted by a linear gradient of 20–500 mm imidazole in buffer B. Next, the fraction containing the SusB protein was loaded onto a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and 300 mm NaCl to remove imidazole. The protein for crystallization was further purified by DEAE-Sepharose FF (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C.Enzyme Assay—The hydrolytic activity of wild type and mutants was measured in the standard reaction mixture containing 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, and 2 mm p-nitrophenyl α-d-glucopyranoside (pNPG), and enzyme was diluted in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, containing 0.05 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin at 37 °C. After incubation, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 volumes of 1 m sodium carbonate. The amount of p-nitrophenol released was measured by determining the absorption at 400 nm in a 1-cm cuvette, considering a molar extinction coefficient of 5,560 m-1 cm-1. One unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 μmol of reducing sugar in 1 min under these reaction conditions.The kinetic constants were calculated by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression using the computer program Kaleidagraph version 3.6 (Synergy Software, Reading, PA), in which initial velocities (v) were measured under 10 substrate concentrations (s) in 40 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5, at 37 °C using 2.4–12 nm enzyme. The glucose released was quantified by the glucose oxidase method.Ki values for the competitive inhibitors acarbose and Tris(2-aminoethyl)amine were determined with pNPG as the substrate using the equation v = [E]0[S]kcat/([S] + Km(1 + [I]/Ki)), where v is the initial rate of hydrolysis, [E]0 is the total enzyme concentration, and [S] and [I] are the substrate and inhibitor concentrations, respectively.The pH activity dependence was determined using sodium barbital buffer, pH 4.0–9.0, and 2 mm pNPG as the substrate. For pH stability, aliquots of 20 μl of enzyme (6 nm) were kept at 4 °C for 24 h in sodium barbital buffer, pH 2.5–9.0, or 85 mm glycine-NaOH buffer, pH 9.0–12.8. After incubation, 40 μl of 200 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 6.5, was added, and remaining pNPG hydrolysis activity was examined under standard conditions, except 80 mm MES-NaOH buffer was used. The effects of temperature on pNPG hydrolysis were examined under standard conditions (0.49 nm enzyme) but at 25–70 °C for 10 min. For determination of thermal stability, the enzyme (4 nm) was kept at various temperatures for 15 min in 60 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.02 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and residual activity was measured in the standard assay. To examine the effects of calcium ions, the apo-form of SusB was prepared by gel filtration through a Bio-Gel P-6 column equilibrated with 100 mm EDTA, pH 6.5, and residual activity was measured under the standard conditions.Analysis of the Anomeric Form of the Product—The anomeric form of the hydrolytic product from pNPG was determined by HPLC. The enzyme reaction was performed in 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C with an enzyme concentration of 12.5 μm. After incubation for 1 and 20 min, aliquots (10 μl) were loaded onto a TSK-GEL amide-80 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) and eluted with 80% (v/v) acetonitrile at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min at room temperature, separating the glucose anomers. The products were detected using a light-scattering detector (ELSD model 400; SofTA, Brighton, CO). The retention times of α- and β-glucose were confirmed by loading a solution of α-glucose (Sigma) and β-glucose (Sigma) onto the column.Sequence Alignment—The amino acid sequences of GH97 members were obtained by BLAST search in sequence cluster UniRef50 using SusB as the query sequence. Among the hit sequences, the top 20 scoring sequences were aligned using ClustalW.Crystallization—Initial crystallization trials were performed by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method in 96-well plates using a series of crystallization kits produced by Hampton Research (Laguna Niguel, CA) and Emerald BioSystems (Bainbridge Island, WA). The crystals appeared under condition number 34 of Wizard II (100 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000). After optimization of the crystallization conditions (pH, precipitant content and concentration, and protein concentration) using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method in 24-well plates, well ordered crystals were obtained with 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.6–8.0 and 6–12% (v/v), polyethylene glycol 6000, or 2–8% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 20,000 and enzyme concentrations of 10 mg/ml. These triangle-shaped crystals appeared in 1 day and reached maximum size (0.2 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm) in 4 weeks at room temperature. The crystal of SusB in complex with acarbose (SusB-acarbose complex) was obtained by soaking a crystal in reservoir solution containing 10 mm acarbose for 24 h.Data Collection and Processing—A SAD data set was collected to 2.2 Å resolution on an R-AXIS VII imaging-plate detector using an in-house CrKα (2.29 Å) source (Rigaku FR-E SuperBright with a Cu/Cr dual target). The crystal was transferred to reservoir solution supplemented with 35% (v/v) glycerol as a cryoprotectant, and then mounted using a loop- and buffer-less mount method (18Kitago Y. Watanabe N. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and flash-cooled under a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K.Although the high resolution data set (1.6 Å) was collected at beam line AR-NW12 of the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan), the SusB-acarbose complex data were measured on an R-AXIS IV imaging plate diffractometer using in-house CuKα (1.54 Å) source (Rigaku MicroMax 007). For data collection, the native and complex crystals were soaked in reservoir solution supplemented with 30% (v/v) glycerol and 25% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, respectively. Subsequently the crystals were mounted in CryoLoop and flash-cooled under a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. All data sets were indexed, integrated, scaled, and merged using the HKL2000 program package (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38361) Google Scholar). The crystals of SusB belong to the space group P21 with unit cell parameters a = 75.6 Å, b = 112.3 Å, c = 102.5 Å, and β = 100.7° (native data).

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) Open table in a new tab RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBiochemical Characteristics of Recombinant SusB—The recombinant SusB was produced in E. coli and purified by His affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme was migrated as a single band, the Mr of which was estimated to be 83,000 on SDS-PAGE. The Mr of 84,380 calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence was consistent with that of 83,000 seen on SDS-PAGE.The effects of pH and temperature on the hydrolytic activities toward pNPG were examined. The pH optimum was 6.5, and the enzyme was stable between pH 4.0 and 12.0 at 4 °C for 24 h. The enzyme was stable at temperatures up to 45 °C for 15 min of heat treatment, and maximum hydrolysis rate was obtained at 45 °C. As described below, the crystal structure of SusB included a calcium ion at the active center. The dependence of the enzyme activity on the calcium ion was examined. The reaction rate was reduced from 80 to 3.8 μmol/min/mg (4.8%) for the apoenzyme compared with calcium-bound enzyme.Inhibition constants, Ki, for acarbose and Tris were measured using pNPG as the substrate. Inhibition was strictly competitive in both compounds, and Ki values were 0.15 ± 0.03 and 37.5E3 ± 1.1E3 μm for acarbose and Tris, respectively. Strong inhibition by acarbose indicated that the reaction pathway of SusB involves an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state similar to standard glycoside hydrolases as acarbose, which possesses the valienamine unit at the nonreducing terminal end, is widely believed to be an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state analog. The kinetic parameters for various substrates with α-glucosidic linkage were investigated. Michaelis constant (Km) and the molecular activity (kcat) are summarized in Table 4. SusB had a wide specificity on various types of α-glucosidic linkage of not only α-1,4- but also α-1,2-, α-1,3-, and α-1,6-linkage in glucobioses. pNPG is the best substrate with a kcat/Km value 6-fold greater than that of maltose. Among the malto-oligosaccharides with various degrees of polymerization (DP), maltotriose was the best substrate. The kcat/Km value for panose (α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→6)-α-d-glucopyranosyl-(1→4)-d-glucopyranose) was also high even though the value for isomaltose was low, suggesting that SusB shows higher specificity on trisaccharides. The activity was low on longer malto-oligosaccharides (DP ≥ 5). The role of SusB is to hydrolyze disaccharides and trisaccharides produced by neopullulanase, encoded on susA, into glucose units (10D'Elia J. Salyers A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 7173-7179Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and thus the preference for trisaccharides agrees with the role of SusB in vivo. The Km value for soluble starch was almost the same as that for maltotetraose, whereas the Km value for amylase DP17 was higher, suggesting that SusB should prefer amylopectin to amylose. The relationship between substrate specificity and structure of the active site is discussed below.TABLE 4Kinetic constants for hydrolysis of various substrates by SusBComponentsKmkcatkcat/Kmmms–1s–1 mm–1Maltose1.05 ± 0.12182 ± 0.58172Maltotriose0.29 ± 0.01270 ± 5.5943Maltotetraose0.64 ± 0.07321 ± 15504Maltopentaose1.29 ± 0.07434 ± 4.9337Maltohexaose2.71 ± 0.51346 ± 36.5128Maltoheptaose4.58 ± 0.52381 ± 13.583.3Amylose DP176.89 ± 0.45321 ± 9.7146.6Soluble starch0.67 ± 0.06115 ± 2.08172Kojibiose (α-1,2)2.39 ± 0.21141 ± 7.658.9Nigerose (α-1,3)3.14 ± 0.16207 ± 7.666.1Isomaltose (α-1,6)6.34 ± 0.35105 ± 4.616.6Panose (α-1,6→α-1,4)0.31 ± 0.03160 ± 6.5513p-Nitrophenyl α-glucoside0.16 ± 0.01161 ± 4.51,023 Open table in a new tab Anomeric Configuration of Product—SusB hydrolyzes the α-glucosidic linkage in the nonreducing terminal end of the substrate. Such exo-type hydrolases can be divided into two enzymes, glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.3, 1,4-α-d-glucan glucohydrolase) and α-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20, α-d-glucoside glucohydrolase), by anomeric configuration of product, α-glucose or β-glucose. α-Glucosidase produces α-glucose by a retaining mechanism, whereas glucoamylase produces β-glucose by an inverting mechanism. The anomeric composition of the degradation products of pNPG by SusB was examined by HPLC. As shown in Fig. 1, the enzyme produced β-anomer of glucose in the reaction for 1 min, and α-glucose was detected with increasing reaction time. The α-glucose formation could be explained to occur through spontaneous mutarotation of the hydrolytic product, β-glucose. This result strongly suggests that SusB hydrolyzes the nonreducing terminal side of the α-glucosidic linkage of the substrate with an inverting mechanism, i.e. SusB is not an α-glucosidase but a glucoamylase.Overall Structure—The crystal structure of SusB was solved by the SAD method at 2.2 Å resolut"
https://openalex.org/W2092299335,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most frequent viral complication in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. As CMV replication is tightly controlled by the cellular arm of specific immunity, the kinetics of CMV-specific T cells in association with individual reactivation episodes were prospectively analyzed in 40 allogeneic transplant recipients in a routine clinical setting and evaluated as determinant of impaired CMV control. Antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cells were quantified directly from whole blood using intracellular cytokine staining after specific stimulation and MHC class I multimers, respectively. Highly dynamic intraindividual changes of CMV-specific CD4 T cells were observed in patients experiencing CMV viremia. Episodes of CMV reactivation were associated with a drop of CMV-specific CD4 T cells that re-increased after viral clearance (p<0.0001). Furthermore, levels of CMV-specific CD4 T cells at the onset of viremia inversely correlated with peak viral load thereafter (p = 0.02). In contrast, CMV-peptide specific CD8 T cells did not show any association with viremia (p = 0.82). Interestingly, therapeutic dosages of cyclosporine A and corticosteroids led to a dose-dependent reduction of CMV-specific T-cell functions, indicating a causal link between intensified immunosuppressive treatment and CMV reactivation. In conclusion, levels of CMV-specific CD4 T cells inversely correlate with reactivation episodes and may represent a valuable measure to individually guide antiviral therapy after stem cell transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2080413331,"The tumor suppressor p53 regulates downstream genes in response to many cellular stresses and is frequently mutated in human cancers. Here, we report the use of a crosslinking strategy to trap a tetrameric p53 DNA-binding domain (p53DBD) bound to DNA and the X-ray crystal structure of the protein/DNA complex. The structure reveals that two p53DBD dimers bind to B form DNA with no relative twist and that a p53 tetramer can bind to DNA without introducing significant DNA bending. The numerous dimer–dimer interactions involve several strictly conserved residues, thus suggesting a molecular basis for p53DBD-DNA binding cooperativity. Surface residue conservation of the p53DBD tetramer bound to DNA highlights possible regions of other p53 domain or p53 cofactor interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2170430128,"A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) suggested that polymorphisms in or around the genes HCP5, HLA-C and ZNRD1 confer restriction against HIV-1 viral replication or disease progression. Here, we also find that these alleles are associated with different aspects of HIV disease, albeit mainly in European Americans. Additionally, we offer that because the GWAS cohort was a subset of HIV-positive individuals, selected based in part on having a low viral load, the observed associations for viral load are magnified compared with those we detect in a large well-characterized prospective natural history cohort of HIV-1-infected persons. We also find that because of linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns, the dominant viral load- and disease-influencing associations for the ZNRD1 or HLA-C and HCP5 alleles are apparent mainly when these alleles are present in HLA-A10- or HLA-B*57-containing haplotypes, respectively. ZNRD1 alleles lacking HLA-A10 did not confer disease protection whereas ZNRD1-A10 haplotypes did. When examined in isolation, the HCP5-G allele associates with a slow disease course and lower viral loads. However, in multivariate models, after partitioning out the protective effects of B*57, the HCP5-G allele associates with disease-acceleration and enhanced viral replication; these associations for HCP5-G are otherwise obscured because of the very strong LD between this allele and a subset of protective B*57 alleles. Furthermore, HCP5 and HLA-C alleles stratify B*57-containing genotypes into those that associate with either striking disease retardation or progressive disease, providing one explanation for the long-standing conundrum of why some HLA-B*57-carrying individuals are long-term non-progressors, whereas others exhibit progressive disease. Collectively, these data generally underscore the strong dependence of genotype-phenotype relationships upon cohort design, phenotype selection, LD patterns and populations studied. They specifically demonstrate that the influence of ZNRD1 alleles on disease progression rates are attributable to HLA-A10, help clarify the relationship between the HCP5, HLA-C and HLA-B*57 alleles, and reaffirm a critical role of HLA-B*57 alleles in HIV disease. Furthermore, as the protective B*57-containing genotypes convey striking salutary effects independent of their strong impact on viral control, it is conceivable that T cell-based therapeutic vaccine strategies aimed at reducing viral loads may be inadequate for limiting AIDS progression, raising the potential need for complementary strategies that target viral load-independent determinants of pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2002278041,"The BED IgG-Capture Enzyme Immunoassay (cBED assay), a test of recent HIV infection, has been used to estimate HIV incidence in cross-sectional HIV surveys. However, there has been concern that the assay overestimates HIV incidence to an unknown extent because it falsely classifies some individuals with non-recent HIV infections as recently infected. We used data from a longitudinal HIV surveillance in rural South Africa to measure the fraction of people with non-recent HIV infection who are falsely classified as recently HIV-infected by the cBED assay (the long-term false-positive ratio (FPR)) and compared cBED assay-based HIV incidence estimates to longitudinally measured HIV incidence.We measured the long-term FPR in individuals with two positive HIV tests (in the HIV surveillance, 2003-2006) more than 306 days apart (sample size n = 1,065). We implemented four different formulae to calculate HIV incidence using cBED assay testing (n = 11,755) and obtained confidence intervals (CIs) by directly calculating the central 95(th) percentile of incidence values. We observed 4,869 individuals over 7,685 person-years for longitudinal HIV incidence estimation. The long-term FPR was 0.0169 (95% CI 0.0100-0.0266). Using this FPR, the cross-sectional cBED-based HIV incidence estimates (per 100 people per year) varied between 3.03 (95% CI 2.44-3.63) and 3.19 (95% CI 2.57-3.82), depending on the incidence formula. Using a long-term FPR of 0.0560 based on previous studies, HIV incidence estimates varied between 0.65 (95% CI 0.00-1.32) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.00-1.43). The longitudinally measured HIV incidence was 3.09 per 100 people per year (95% CI 2.69-3.52), after adjustment to the sex-age distribution of the sample used in cBED assay-based estimation.In a rural community in South Africa with high HIV prevalence, the long-term FPR of the cBED assay is substantially lower than previous estimates. The cBED assay performs well in HIV incidence estimation if the locally measured long-term FPR is used, but significantly underestimates incidence when a FPR estimate based on previous studies in other settings is used."
https://openalex.org/W2133067562,"Biogeographic patterns of species invasions hold important clues to solving the recalcitrant 'who', 'where', and 'why' questions of invasion biology, but the few existing studies make no attempt to distinguish alien floras (all non-native occurrences) from invasive floras (rapidly spreading species of significant management concern), nor have invasion biologists asked whether particular habitats are consistently invaded by species from particular regions.Here I describe the native floristic provenances of the 2629 alien plant taxa of the Eastern Deciduous Forest of the Eastern U.S. (EUS), and contrast these to the subset of 449 taxa that EUS management agencies have labeled 'invasive'. Although EUS alien plants come from all global floristic regions, nearly half (45%) have native ranges that include central and northern Europe or the Mediterranean (39%). In contrast, EUS invasive species are most likely to come from East Asia (29%), a pattern that is magnified when the invasive pool is restricted to species that are native to a single floristic region (25% from East Asia, compared to only 11% from northern/central Europe and 2% from the Mediterranean). Moreover, East Asian invaders are mostly woody (56%, compared to just 23% of the total alien flora) and are significantly more likely to invade intact forests and riparian areas than European species, which dominate managed or disturbed ecosystems.These patterns suggest that the often-invoked 'imperialist dogma' view of global invasions equating invasion events with the spread of European colonialism is at best a restricted framework for invasion in disturbed ecosystems. This view must be superseded by a biogeographic invasion theory that is explicitly habitat-specific and can explain why particular world biotas tend to dominate particular environments."
https://openalex.org/W2163145255,"Temporal organization of biological processes requires massively parallel processing on a synchronized time-base. We analyzed time-series data obtained from the bioenergetic oscillatory outputs of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and isolated cardiomyocytes utilizing Relative Dispersional (RDA) and Power Spectral (PSA) analyses. These analyses revealed broad frequency distributions and evidence for long-term memory in the observed dynamics. Moreover RDA and PSA showed that the bioenergetic dynamics in both systems show fractal scaling over at least 3 orders of magnitude, and that this scaling obeys an inverse power law. Therefore we conclude that in S. cerevisiae and cardiomyocytes the dynamics are scale-free in vivo. Applying RDA and PSA to data generated from an in silico model of mitochondrial function indicated that in yeast and cardiomyocytes the underlying mechanisms regulating the scale-free behavior are similar. We validated this finding in vivo using single cells, and attenuating the activity of the mitochondrial inner membrane anion channel with 4-chlorodiazepam to show that the oscillation of NAD(P)H and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be abated in these two evolutionarily distant species. Taken together these data strongly support our hypothesis that the generation of ROS, coupled to redox cycling, driven by cytoplasmic and mitochondrial processes, are at the core of the observed rhythmicity and scale-free dynamics. We argue that the operation of scale-free bioenergetic dynamics plays a fundamental role to integrate cellular function, while providing a framework for robust, yet flexible, responses to the environment."
https://openalex.org/W2028128538,"Functional neural networks in the human brain can be studied from correlations between activated gray matter regions measured with fMRI. However, while providing important information on gray matter activation, no information is gathered on the co-activity along white matter tracts in neural networks.We report on a functional diffusion tensor imaging (fDTI) method that measures task-related changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) along white matter tracts. We hypothesize that these fractional anisotropy changes relate to morphological changes of glial cells induced by axonal activity although the exact physiological underpinnings of the measured FA changes remain to be elucidated. As expected, these changes are very small as compared to the physiological noise and a reliable detection of the signal change would require a large number of measurements. However, a substantial increase in signal-to-noise ratio was achieved by pooling the signal over the complete fiber tract. Adopting such a tract-based statistics enabled us to measure the signal within a practically feasible time period. Activation in the sensory thalamocortical tract and optic radiation in eight healthy human subjects was found during tactile and visual stimulation, respectively.The results of our experiments indicate that these FA changes may serve as a functional contrast mechanism for white matter. This noninvasive fDTI method may provide a new approach to study functional neural networks in the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2032445528,"The function of retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in the regulation of small intestine epithelial cell homeostasis has been challenged by several groups using various promoter-based Cre transgenic mouse lines. Interestingly, different pRb deletion systems yield dramatically disparate small intestinal phenotypes. These findings confound the function of pRb in this dynamic tissue. In this study, Villin-Cre transgenic mice were crossed with Rb (flox/flox) mice to conditionally delete pRb protein in small intestine enterocytes. We discovered a novel hyperplasia phenotype as well as ectopic cell cycle reentry within villus enterocytes in the small intestine. This phenotype was not seen in other pRb family member (p107 or p130) null mice. Using a newly developed crypt/villus isolation method, we uncovered that expression of pRb was undetectable, whereas proliferating cell nuclear antigen, p107, cyclin E, cyclin D3, Cdk2, and Cdc2 were dramatically increased in pRb-deficient villus cells. Cyclin A, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and Cdk4/6 expression was not affected by absent pRb expression. pRb-deficient villus cells appeared capable of progressing to mitosis but with higher rates of apoptosis. However, the cycling villus enterocytes were not completely differentiated as gauged by significant reduction of intestinal fatty acid-binding protein expression. In summary, pRb, but not p107 or p130, is required for maintaining the postmitotic villus cell in quiescence, governing the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, and completing of absorptive enterocyte differentiation in the small intestine.

The small intestine is a very dynamic tissue with proliferative epithelial cells invaginating into the mesenchyme to form flask-shaped crypts, whereas differentiated cells project into the lumen, covering finger-like villi. Fresh cells are generated from the stems cells that are either seated at the traditional +4 position from the bottom of the crypts or scattered between Paneth cells (so-called crypt base columnar cells) (1Reya T. Clevers H. Nature. 2005; 434: 843-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (3046) Google Scholar, 2Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H.

Newly produced cells either migrate upward onto the villus and differentiate into absorptive enterocytes, goblet cells, or enteroendocrine cells or migrate down to the crypt bottom and differentiate into Paneth cells. After the cells pass the cryptvillus junction, they have already exited the cell cycle and are terminally differentiated into functional absorptive or secretory cells. These functionally differentiated cells finally shed into the lumen roughly 3–5 days after original generation (4Potten C.S. Loeffler M.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2796-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The major function of the pocket protein family members is to regulate the G1/S checkpoint and cell cycle progression, mainly through interaction with the E2F family of transcription factors that, in turn, regulate many genes necessary for both the G1/S and G2/M transition (6Dimova D.K. Dyson N.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2810-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Because germ line Rb–/– is lethal, pRb function has recently been studied in a conditional tissue-specific ablation fashion (7Wikenheiser-Brokamp K.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 767-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 8Vidal A. Carneiro C. Zalvide J.B. Front. Biosci. 2007; 12: 4483-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the small intestine, three different groups have reported knocking out pRb protein specifically in the intestine, each with disparate findings. One group crossed I-FABP Cre transgenic mice with Rb (flox/flox) mice (9Haigis K. Sage J. Glickman J. Shafer S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 638-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The generated pRb intestine conditional nulls still expressed pRb, although at a reduced level. These mice did not demonstrate an abnormal small intestinal phenotype, but they did show ectopic cell cycle in colon enterocytes. Another group crossed collagen 1A1 Cre mice with Rb (flox/flox) mice to delete pRb in the small intestine (10Yang H.S. Hinds P.W. BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). They identified hyper-proliferation in the putative crypts region and in the villi. The mice died shortly after birth. This phenotype, however, could not be conclusively tied to conditionally deleting pRb in enterocytes, as the author acknowledged that the collagen 1A1 promoter is not enterocyte-specific. Finally, another group used Villin Cre transgenic mice that were crossed with Rb (flox/flox) mice to delete pRb in the intestine (11Kucherlapati M.H. Nguyen A.A. Bronson R.T. Kucherlapati R.S. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 3576-3583Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These investigators found aggressive tumors developed outside of the intestine after the mice reached 12–17 months of age. The detailed small intestinal effects from this pRb-deficient mouse strain, however, were not described. The purpose of this study was to delineate the effects of enterocyte-specific deletion of pRb expression on the phenotype of the small intestine. To accomplish this, we bred Villin Cre transgenic mice with Rb (flox/flox) mice to delete pRb. Furthermore, we developed a new method to effectively separate villi from crypts, which enabled us to study pRb function in proliferating and postmitotic enterocytes, respectively. We found a unique and not previously described phenotype in the pRb ablation mice in which pRb expression was undetectable, and we discovered that pRb deficiency alone was sufficient to perturb the cell cycle and differentiation in villus cells. Enterocyte Isolation—Sections of distal jejunum (5–6 cm) were removed, flushed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cut open longitudinally, and immersed in fresh ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 μm cantharidin). The bowel was then cut into three equal pieces and put into 5 ml of ice-cold BSS buffer (1.5 mm KCl, 96 mm NaCl, 27 mm sodium citrate, 8 mm KH2PO4, 5.6 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) with inhibitors as above, vortexed at 4 °C at maximum speed for 5 min. This process was repeated two additional times for 3 and 7 min, respectively, using fresh BSS solution. After a total of 15 min of vortexing, almost all epithelial cells were recovered in the BSS solution. The BSS solution was examined under light microscopy after each round of vortexing. The first sample consisted of debris and a few villi. The second sample had the majority of the villi. The third sample had the majority of the crypts with the remaining muscle. The muscle was collected and washed with BSS buffer to get rid of contamination by epithelial cells. The BSS solution (with crypts and villi) was then passed through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences) to isolate crypts from villi. The smaller size crypts passed through the cell strainer and were collected in the effluent. The larger size villi were captured in the cell strainer. The crypt and villus fractions were then spun down at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed once with Tris buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with inhibitors as above. The resulting pellets were saved at –80 °C for future RNA or protein experiments. Mice—Mice containing Rb alleles in which exon 19 is flanked by loxP sites (Rb(flox/flox)) (12Marino S.

Villin Cre transgenic mice were obtained from the Mouse Repository of the Mouse Model of Human Cancers Consortium (Frederick, MD) and have been previously characterized (14el Marjou F. Janssen K.P. Chang B.H. Li M. Hindie V. Chan L. Louvard D. Chambon P. Metzger D. Robine S. Genesis. 2004; 39: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Villin Cre mice were intercrossed with Rb(flox/flox) mice to generate small intestine conditional pRb knock-out mice that were homozygous for the floxed Rb and contained Villin Cre (we will thereafter call this mouse strain VC+ Rb (f/f)). The animals were housed at the animal facilities at the Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. BrdUrd Labeling and Immunostaining—Ninety minutes prior to tissue harvest, the mice received a subcutaneous injection with 1 ml/100 g body weight of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling agent (3 mg of BrdUrd/ml; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The sections from the distal jejunum were then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections. Immunostaining was performed according to the instructions associated with the specific antibodies. The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-BrdUrd (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), anti-p-histone 3, anti-PCNA, anti-cleaved caspase-3 (all from Cell Signaling; Danvers, MA), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (all from Invitrogen). An index of proliferation rate was determined by counting the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells and total crypt cells in 20 full well oriented crypts. Apoptosis rate was determined by counting the number of cleaved caspase 3-positive cells within 100 villi. Western Blotting—Isolated enterocyte pellets stored at –80 °C were reconstituted with Tris buffer and sonicated at 4 °C. The samples were then lysed with 1× SDS loading buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The protein concentration was determined using an RC DC kit from Bio-Rad. Equal amounts of protein were subjected to Western blotting assay. The primary antibodies against the following proteins were used in this study: Cdk2 and pRb (Pharmingen); cyclin A, cyclin E, and tubulin (Millipore; Billerica, MA); p107, p130, intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP), MCM6 (minichromosome maintenance-deficient 6), PTK6 (protein-tyrosine kinase 6), and cell division cycle 2 (Cdc2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); p-pRb (T821) and cyclin D2 (Invitrogen). The remaining antibodies against the following proteins were from Cell Signaling: platelet-derived growth factor receptor α, PCNA, p-pRb (Ser-807/811), p-pRb (Ser-780), cyclin D1, cyclin D3, Cdk4, Cdk6, and p-histone 3. VC+ Rb(f/f) Mice Have Small Intestine Mucosal Hyperplasia—Mice that contained Villin Cre and were homozygous for Rb (flox/flox) were born at an expected ratio with normal body weight. These mice have survived for 8 months so far with no obvious health problems. Strikingly, hyperplasia was clearly identified in the small intestine mucosal layer, which has not been previously reported. The crypts were significantly deeper and villi taller when compared with the wild type littermates by using hematoxylin and eosin staining (Fig. 1). As a gauge of enterocyte proliferation, the ratio of BrdUrd-positive cells to total crypt cells increased about 20% in VC+Rb(f/f) small intestine when compared with the wild type littermates. Moreover, in the absence of pRb, BrdUrd-labeled cells were no longer restricted to the crypt compartment, as BrdUrd-labeled cells clearly extended into the villus (Fig. 1B). This suggests that pRb is required for postmitotic villus cells to exit the cell cycle. To exclude the possibility of faster migration from crypts, villus cells were further checked for the expression of the cell proliferation marker PCNA. PCNA staining was confined to the crypt area in wild type small intestine. In contrast, PCNA staining in the VC+Rb(f/f) mice expanded into the villi (Fig. 1C), thus confirming that the villus cells were indeed proliferating. Because PCNA is a well known pRb/E2F targeted protein, these results are consistent with the loss of functional pRb in the villi. pRb Is Undetectable in VC+Rb(f/f) Mice—Our VC+Rb(f/f) mice yielded a distinctive small intestinal phenotype compared with previous I-FABP Cre;Rb(flox/flox) mice (9Haigis K. Sage J. Glickman J. Shafer S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 638-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered if the phenotype could be due to different deletion efficiency because I-FABP promoter activity is known to be mosaic (9Haigis K. Sage J. Glickman J. Shafer S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 638-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas the Villin promoter is more evenly distributed across the small intestine (14el Marjou F. Janssen K.P. Chang B.H. Li M. Hindie V. Chan L. Louvard D. Chambon P. Metzger D. Robine S. Genesis. 2004; 39: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). To investigate the efficiency of pRb deletion in VC+Rb(f/f) mice and the distinct function of pRb in crypt versus villus enterocytes, separation of these distinct cellular regions was necessary. Although there are several methods to isolate crypts from villi in the literature, each is associated with pitfalls (see under “Discussion”). We therefore developed a new isolation method as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, by using vigorous shaking (vortexing) and a cell strainer, we successfully separated crypts, villi, and underlying mesenchyme/muscle from the small intestine at a low temperature (4 °C) that is critical for keeping the recovered protein and RNA intact. To validate the purity and integrity of isolated crypts, villi, and mesenchyme/muscle fractions, we first evaluated morphology by light microscopy. As demonstrated in Fig. 2A, crypt fractions revealed a U-shaped structure with dark granules on the bottom representing the Paneth cell region. In contrast, the villus fraction showed typical cylindrical shapes with the crypt-villus junction areas still intact. The mesenchyme/muscle fraction showed intact lamina propria connecting to the muscle layer. Purity was further established with distinct molecule markers for each cellular compartment by Western blotting. The expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor α is known to be present only in mesenchyme (15Clevers H. Cell. 2006; 127: 469-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4556) Google Scholar). PTK6 is a marker for villus enterocytes (16Haegebarth A. Bie W. Yang R. Crawford S.E. Vasioukhin V. Fuchs E. Tyner A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4949-4957Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas pRb phosphorylation at Ser-807/811 was shown to be present only in crypt enterocytes (17Taylor J.A. Martin C.A. Nair R. Guo J. Erwin C.R. Warner B.W. J. Pediatr. Surg. 2008; 43: 1018-1024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The localization of these cell-specific proteins was validated by Western blotting. Phosphorylation of pRb at Ser-807/811 was revealed in the mesenchyme/muscle fraction, which might reflect low proliferative activity in this compartment. This method was then used to investigate pRb deletion efficiency in crypt and villus enterocytes in the VC+Rb(f/f) mice. As shown in Fig. 2B, we saw a near-complete deletion of pRb in both crypts and villi. At the same time, we noticed that pRb displayed multiple bands in the crypts, which might reflect hyperphosphorylation of this protein in the aggressively proliferating compartment. Indeed, when site-specific antibodies for pRb phosphorylation were used for Western blotting, we found that pRb was phosphorylated only in crypts on sites Ser-780, Thr-821, and Ser-807/811. The p-pRb (Ser-780) antibody also picked up two slower migrating bands that is likely nonspecific, because they appeared in the small intestine taken from pRb-null mice. These results endorse the notion that pRb phosphorylation is likely to be an important regulatory mechanism for enterocyte proliferation and differentiation under normal conditions. VC+Rb(f/f) Mice Small Intestine Show Compensatory Expression of p107 and p130, but Failed to Rescue pRb Function—The expression and function of pRb may be compensated by the other pocket protein family members p107 and p130 (18Ruiz S. Santos M. Segrelles C. Leis H. Jorcano J.L. Berns A. Paramio J.M. Vooijs M. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2737-2748Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 19MacLellan W.R. Garcia A. Oh H. Frenkel P. Jordan M.C. Roos K.P. Schneider M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2486-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We first looked at p107 and p130 protein distribution in crypts and villi by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 3, p107 protein was strongly present in the highly proliferating crypts, which agrees with the reported immunostaining pattern for this protein (9Haigis K. Sage J. Glickman J. Shafer S. Jacks T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 638-647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The expression of p130 was evenly spread between the crypts and villi in normal mice and was absent in p130-null mice, as expected. Similar to pRb, p107 expression in crypts also displayed multiple bands, which may reflect possible differential phosphorylation of this protein within crypt enterocytes. For p130, its migration pattern in SDS-PAGE appeared to be no different between crypts and villi. We then looked at the compensatory expression of these pocket proteins in the absence of one another. As shown in Fig. 3, we found that all the pocket proteins were capable of compensatory elevated expression in the absence of the others in both crypts and villi. The single exception was in the villi of either p107- or p130-null animals, in which the expression of pRb was not enhanced. Despite these compensatory expression changes, villus and crypt morphology and rates of proliferation were not affected by loss of either p107 or p130 (data not shown). These results suggest that high levels of either p107 or p130 protein in the pRb-null villi cannot suppress villus cell cycle reentry. In summary, our isolation method permitted demonstration of a different distribution and phosphorylation pattern of all three pocket proteins within different cellular compartments of the small intestine. Even though pRb expression was compensated by p107 and p130 in crypts and villi, its function was not, indicating a distinct and non-overlapping role for pRb in the regulation of normal small intestine homeostasis. Deficient pRb Perturbs Expression of Multiple Cell Cycle-associated Proteins in Enterocytes—pRb has been well known to regulate cell cycle-associated proteins via E2F transcription factor family proteins. We therefore sought to investigate the expression of well characterized pRb/E2F-targeted proteins as well as atypical cell cycle-associated proteins in the pRb-null small intestine (Fig. 4). Because pRb phosphorylation status is different in crypts and villi, we decided to look at both compartments. By immunostaining, PCNA has been identified in the villi in pRb-null small intestine. Now the immunoblotting results clearly showed PCNA was indeed spread into villi only in the absence of pRb but not p107 or p130. Cyclin E expression was mostly in crypts in normal mice. Deletion of pRb increased its expression no less than 5-fold in crypts with a more dramatic increase in villi. In contrast, p107 or p130 deficiency had no effect on cyclin E expression in the small intestine. The fact that cyclin E expression was largely repressed by pRb in the small intestine, even in highly proliferating crypts, indicates that cyclin E expression is mainly regulated by pRb itself and probably only partially regulated by pRb phosphorylation. This notion is also supported by the fact that deletion of hypophosphorylated pRb in villi released cyclin E expression. Cyclin A was exclusively expressed in crypts in normal mice. Its expression has been shown to be regulated by pRb (13Mayhew C.N. Bosco E.E. Fox S.R. Okaya T. Tarapore P. Schwemberger S.J. Babcock G.F. Lentsch A.B. Fukasawa K. Knudsen E.S.

Montecucco A. Meccia E. Crescenzi M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, in small intestine, its expression seemed unaffected by any pocket protein studied. Three cyclin D proteins (D1, D2, and D3) were expressed in the small intestine with the highest levels in the crypts of normal mice. Cyclin D1 expression was less affected by the different pocket protein deletions, although the expression of cyclins D2 and D3 was regulated by different pocket proteins. Cyclin D2 expression was increased in crypts in the absence of p107 or p130. On the other hand, cyclin D3 expression was increased in both crypts and villi upon pRb depletion. Interestingly, β-catenin, which could regulate cyclin D1 expression, was found to be evenly spread across crypts and villi, and its expression and distribution were not affected by the absent expression of any pocket family protein (supplemental Fig. S1). The expression of the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) was also affected by pocket protein deletion. The majority of Cdk2/4/6 and Cdc2 (Cdk1) expression was located in the proliferating crypts in normal mice. pRb deletion elicited Cdk2 and Cdc2 expression in villi. Furthermore, Cdc2 expression was increased in p107- or p130-null crypts. Cdk4/6 expression and location were not affected by Rb family proteins. To confirm that pRb was deleted only in enterocytes in VC+Rb(f/f) small intestine, Western blotting for Rb family and cell cycle regulatory proteins were performed on the isolated mesenchyme and muscle fraction (stromal tissue and lacking enterocytes). The expression of pRb as well as other cell cycle-related proteins was indeed intact in the stromal tissue (supplemental Fig. S2). As expected, p107 and p130 expression was absent in the stromal tissue of p107-null and p130-null mice, respectively. There was a compensatory increase in the expression of pRb in response to the loss of p107 or p130 in the stromal tissue. The expression of all the other cell cycle proteins, except for cyclin E and Cdc2, was not affected by the absence of p107 or p130 (supplemental Fig. S2). In summary, our results revealed that cell cycle-associated protein expression was highest in crypts, dramatically decreased as cells migrated into villi, and was differentially regulated by Rb family proteins in the small intestine. These data also imply that pRb regulates cell cycle exit in the villi via active repression of cell cycle protein expression such as cyclin E, cyclin D3, Cdk2, and Cdc2. Ectopic Proliferating Villus Cells in VC+Rb(f/f) Mice Progress to Mitosis, Have Greater Rates of Apoptosis, and Have Impaired Absorptive Enterocyte Differentiation Programming—Because villus cells were still in S phase in VC+Rb(f/f) mice, we wondered if they could progress to mitosis. To this end, phosphorylation of histone 3 at Ser-10 was used as an indication for active mitosis. Mitosis in the crypts of WT and pRb-deficient mice could not be distinguished by either immunostaining (Fig. 5A) or Western blot analysis (data not shown). However, pRb deficiency greatly increased this M phase marker in villus cells, indicating that most of the cells were able to complete mitosis in the absence of pRb in villi (Fig. 5B). This may account for the hyperplasia seen in the villus of pRb-null intestine. The continued cycling of villus cells in pRb-null small intestine also led us to question whether these cells could have abnormal apoptosis, because pRb has been shown to regulate apoptosis in other tissues (22Wikenheiser-Brokamp K.A. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 4299-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 23Sage C. Huang M. Vollrath M.A. Brown M.C. Hinds P.W. Corey D.P. Vetter D.E. Chen Z.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7345-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As revealed in Fig. 5C, pRb deletion resulted in about 3-fold increased rates of apoptosis in cycling villus cells as indicated by immunohistochemistry staining for cleaved caspase-3 on the paraffin-embedded small intestine. In summary, these data suggest that pRb is required for maintaining a quiescent status and protecting villus enterocytes from abnormal apoptosis. After migrating to the villus region, enterocytes exit the cell cycle and differentiate into either secretory or absorptive cell lineages. We therefore wondered if villus cell differentiation programming is affected by the ectopic cell cycle in pRb-deficient mice. The absorptive enterocyte differentiation was evaluated by measuring I-FABP protein expression. As expected, I-FABP was heavily expressed in the villi with very little expression in the crypts (data not shown). We then compared villus I-FABP expression of WT littermates with pRb-nulls. As shown in Fig. 5D, I-FABP expression was dramatically reduced in pRb-null villus cells. Yet at the same time, the expression of a marker for undifferentiated enterocytes, minichromosome maintenance deficient 6 (MCM6), was significantly increased in all pRb-null villi. These results strongly support the notion that pRb is required for absorptive cell differentiation in the villi. The role of p107 and p130 in absorptive cell differentiation was also examined and found not to be involved (data not shown). The secretory cell lineage was also examined and found to be unaffected by pRb ablation (data not shown). These data indicate that pRb is the only pocket protein family member required for absorptive cell differentiation in the small intestine. In this study, we have clearly demonstrated a critical role for pRb, but not the other pocket proteins, as being indispensable for normal exit from the cell cycle as crypt enterocytes emerge to the villus in small intestine. We also reveal a unique pattern of phosphorylation of pRb in small intestine and cell cycle regulatory protein expression as a direct consequence of pRb deficiency. Finally, we demonstrate impaired enterocyte differentiation in response to pRb deficiency. Taken together, these data serve to reveal a crucial role for pRb in the regulation of normal enterocyte turnover in the mouse small intestine. The clinical significance of these findings is the potential involvement of pRb in the pathogenesis of conditions in which normal enterocyte proliferation is perturbed. One such condition is the adaptation response of the remnant bowel to massive intestinal loss (24Drozdowski L. Thomson A.B. World J. Gastroenterol. 2006; 12: 4614-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). During adaptation, enterocyte proliferation is triggered for the generation of taller villi, thereby augmenting the intestinal surface area for digestion and absorption. The involvement of pRb during adaptation-induced enterocyte proliferation and differentiation is presently unknown, but it may be critic"
https://openalex.org/W1997350836,"Impairing intracellular signaling induced by survival factors and excess glutamate have recently been suggested to play important role in neurodegenerative processes. However, the underlying mechanism(s) and interrelationships between these factors mostly remain to be established. In the present study, we show that glutamate attenuates the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor and the survival effect of IGF-1 (100 nm) in hippocampal cultured neurons. Pretreatment of cultured hippocampal neurons with glutamate concentration dependently inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors as well as that of IRS-1 and Shc, two IGF-1 receptor adapter proteins. The effect of glutamate was also evident on the phosphorylation of Akt, as well as its upstream kinase PI3K/PDK1 and downstream targets, GSK3β and FOXO3a. The inhibitory effect of glutamate (1 mm) was blocked by antagonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, including MK801 (20 μm) and AP5 (100 μm), but not by blockers of other ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptor sub-types demonstrating the involvement of the NMDA receptor. This hypothesis is supported further by the observation that treatment with NMDA concentration dependently inhibited the activation and phosphorylation of IGF-1 receptors and downstream targets induced by IGF-1 (100 nm). These findings demonstrate that glutamate can block the effect of IGF-1 by decreasing IGF-1 receptor signaling and responsiveness, hence attenuating the survival properties of this trophic factor in neuronal cells.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, responsible for basal excitatory synaptic transmission and many forms of synaptic plasticity such as long term potentiation and long term depression associated with cognitive processes. The various effects of glutamate are mediated by specific receptors belonging to two major families, namely ionotropic and metabotropic receptors (24Beal M.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6 (review): 3338-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 25Mark L.P. Prost R.W. Ulmer J.L. Smith M.M. Daniels D.L. Strottmann J.M. Brown W.D. Hacein-Bey L. Am. J. Neuroradiol. 2001; 22 (review): 1813-1824PubMed Google Scholar). Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated ion channels consisting of three subtypes known as AMPA(α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methy1-4-isoxazoxazole propionate), NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate), and kainate receptors on the basis of the affinity of their preferential agonist (24Beal M.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6 (review): 3338-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 25Mark L.P. Prost R.W. Ulmer J.L. Smith M.M. Daniels D.L. Strottmann J.M. Brown W.D. Hacein-Bey L. Am. J. Neuroradiol. 2001; 22 (review): 1813-1824PubMed Google Scholar). Metabotropic (mGlu) receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors divided into three main classes. Group I mGlu receptors are coupled to phospholipase C and intracellular Ca2+ signaling, whereas group II and III receptors are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and the production of cAMP. Preferential metabotropic receptor agonists include the excitatory amino acid analogue l-quisqualic acid (group I), DCG-IV (group II), and l-AP4 (group III). Glutamate receptors are essential for the normal functioning of the brain. However, their excessive activation can lead to neuronal damage ranging from acute hypoxic-ischemic brain injuries to chronic neurodegenerative diseases (24Beal M.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6 (review): 3338-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 25Mark L.P. Prost R.W. Ulmer J.L. Smith M.M. Daniels D.L. Strottmann J.M. Brown W.D. Hacein-Bey L. Am. J. Neuroradiol. 2001; 22 (review): 1813-1824PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been suggested that excessive glutamate levels can block the activation of Akt, and hence alter cell survival, linking glutamate excitotoxicity to impaired cell survival signaling (26Chalecka-Franaszek E. Chuang D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8745-8750Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear from this earlier study if trophic factor signaling pathways are involved. We report here that glutamate is able to attenuate the survival promoting effects of IGF-1 by interrupting IGF-1R survival signaling. The effect of glutamate is mediated by the NMDA receptor sub-type as mimicked by NMDA itself and blocked by an antagonist, MK-801. Taken together, these data reveal a novel mechanism by which glutamate and NMDA receptors regulating trophic factor signaling may be involved in a variety of neurotoxic events leading to neurodegenerative diseases.

Human CMV-SHP-2-Myc-His cDNA was from Fulengen (Guangzhou, China), siRNA1–4 for SHP-2 were purchased from Shanghai GenePharma Co. (Shanghai, China). Glutamate and cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen, whereas all other reagents were from Sigma or Fisher Scientific. Hippocampal Neuronal Cultures—Hippocampal cultured neurons were prepared as described by Zheng et al. (27Zheng W.H. Quirion R. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) with minor modifications and from fetuses (embryonic day 20) of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, St. Constant, Quebec, Canada). Animal care was according to protocols and guidelines approved by McGill University Animal Care Committee and the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Hippocampi were dissected in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Tissues were collected and washed 4 or 5 times with HBSS and then submitted to an enzymatic digestion at 37 °C with 0.25% trypsin in HBSS media for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of fetal bovine serum (final concentration 10%), and tissue was rinsed with HBSS 4–5 times to remove fetal bovine serum. The cellular suspension was then obtained by repeating aspirations through a pasteur pipette. Following a centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min, the medium was removed and cells were resuspended in a chemically defined serum-free Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2% B27, 20 μm l-glutamine, 15 mm HEPES, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin. Neurons were plated at density of 5–8 × 105 cells/ml in culture plates (coated with 10 μg/ml poly-d-lysine) under serum-free conditions and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. On the day following the plating, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium. Medium was changed again with either the medium as above or Neurobasal supplemented with 1% N2 after 4–5 days. Experimental treatments were performed on the seventh day after plating. Treatments—Before each experiment, the culture medium was replaced with Neurobasal 2 h before adding the desired reagents. To study the signaling pathways induced by IGF-1 in cultured hippocampal neurons, cells were treated with 100 nm IGF-1 for 6–10 min. To study the effect of glutamate, neurons were pretreated for 1 h with various concentrations of glutamate or NMDA before exposure to IGF-1 as above. Alternatively, cells were first exposed to MK801 (20 μm, 20 min), AP-5 (50 μm, 20 min), 6,7-Dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX) (10 μm, 20 min), LY 341495 (300 nm, 20 min), and CPCCOEt (100 μm, 20 min) followed by a pretreatment with glutamate and then stimulation with 100 nm IGF-1. All experiments were repeated at least three to four times. Transfection of Cultured Hippocampal Neurons with SHP-2 and siRNA for SHP-2 by Nucleofector™—Primary hippocampal neurons from fetuses (embryonic day 20) were prepared as above and the transfections of SHP-2, and its siRNA was performed by Nucleofector (Amaxa, Germany) with 96-well shuttle rat neuron Nucleofector kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blotting—Western blotting was performed as described earlier with some modifications (2Zheng W.H. Kar S. Dore S. Quirion R. J. Neural. Transm. Suppl. 2000; 60: 261-272PubMed Google Scholar, 27Zheng W.H. Quirion R. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, treated cells from different experimental conditions were rinsed twice with ice-cold HBSS and lysed in either sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% w/v SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% w/v bromphenol blue) or RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Igepal CA-630, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO3, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples with equal amounts of protein were then separated by 4–20% PAGE, and the resolved proteins were electrotransferred to Hybond-C nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with 5% nonfat milk and 2% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight with appropriate primary antibody at 4 °C. The membranes were then washed twice with TBST and probed with anti-rat/mouse/rabbit/goat-horseradish peroxidase at room temperature for 1 h. Membranes were finally washed several times with TBST to remove unbound secondary antibodies and visualized using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). A part of the SDS gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to ensure the use of equal amounts of proteins. The respective phosphorylation of IGF-1R/Akt/PDK/FKHRL1/Src/GSK3β/MAPK/PKCpan (PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCγ)/PKCδ was determined by Western blot using anti-phospho-IGF-IR(1165–1166)/Akt, Akt/PDK/FKHRL1/Src/GSK3β/MAPK/PKCpan/PKCδ antibodies. Blots were subsequently striped and reprobed with antibody for respective protein or anti-β-actin to confirm equal protein loading. Determination of Tyrosine Phosphorylation of IGF-1 Receptor, IRS-1, Shc, and P13K by Immunoprecipitation—Cultured hippocampal neurons were treated as described above except that exposure to IGF-1 was 8 min. Cells were then rinsed with cold phosphate-buffered saline twice and collected. After centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, cell pellets were lysed on ice in pre-cold RIPA buffer for 20 min. Cell lysates were then pelleted at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the concentration of protein in each sample was determined using the Bio-Rad dye-binding method with bovine serum albumin as standard. The supernatant with equal amounts of protein was incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-IGF-1R, anti-IRS-1, anti-Shc, or anti-PI3K antibodies. Formed immunocomplexes were isolated by protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), separated by 4–20% SDS gel, and then tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by Western blot using a mixture of anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies 4G10 and PY99. Blots were striped and reprobed with antibodies to ensure equal protein loading. Potential interaction of IGF-1R with NMDA receptors was determined by coimmunoprecipitation of IGF-1 and NMDA receptors using anti-IGF-1R and anti-NMDA receptor antibodies as described above (2Zheng W.H. Kar S. Dore S. Quirion R. J. Neural. Transm. Suppl. 2000; 60: 261-272PubMed Google Scholar). No direct interaction was detected (data not shown). Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance with a Newman-Keuls test was used to calculate difference between means, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Glutamate Attenuates the Tyrosine Phosphorylation of IGF-1 Receptors Induced by IGF-1 and IGF-1-promoted Survival Effects in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—Impaired IGF-1 intracellular signaling and excess glutamate have been suggested to be involved in neurodegenerative processes (24Beal M.F. FASEB J. 1992; 6 (review): 3338-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of exposure to glutamate on IGF-1R signaling and its survival properties, cultured hippocampal neurons were pretreated with 1 mm glutamate, and the tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1Rs and the survival effects of IGF-1 were determined (Fig. 1). IGF-1 caused the tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1R (Fig. 1, A and B) and protected cultured hippocampal neurons from B27 deprivation-induced cell death (Fig. 1C). Pretreatment with glutamate (1 mm) significantly attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of IGF-1Rs (Fig. 1, A and B) and the survival effects of IGF-1 (Fig. 1C). Glutamate Decreases Tyrosine Phosphorylation of IRS-1, Shc, and PI3K—We studied next the effect of glutamate on IGF-1R downstream signaling. Fig. 2A shows that glutamate significantly blocked the phosphorylation of Shc- and IRS-1, two main adaptor proteins of the IGF-1R and that of PI3K, a main downstream signaling protein of IGF-1 (Fig. 2A). Moreover, the effect of glutamate in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and its adaptor protein IRS1 was clearly concentration-dependent (Fig. 2B). Glutamate Attenuates IGF-1-induced Activation of the PI3K/Akt Pathway While Promoting the Phosphorylation of IGF-1-stimulated MAPK—We have previously shown that the PI3K/Akt pathway is essential for the survival effects of IGF-1, whereas the MAPK pathway plays a rather minimal role (27Zheng W.H. Quirion R. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28Zheng W.H. Kar S. Quirion R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we studied the comparative effect of a pretreatment with glutamate on IGF-1-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. Consistent with results in Fig. 2A showing that a pretreatment with glutamate (1 mm) attenuated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PI3K, it also inhibited the activation of PDK1 (an upstream kinase of Akt), the phosphorylation of both Thr-308 and Ser-473 of Akt, and the phosphorylation of GSK3β (Fig. 3) and FOXO3a (Fig. 4). In contrast, the same treatment enhanced IGF-1-induced activation of MAPK and its upstream kinase MEK. Glutamate (1 mm), by itself, only had a minor effect on the Akt pathway while more powerfully stimulating the phosphorylation of MEK and MAPK (Fig. 3). In addition to Akt and MAPK pathways, a pretreatment with glutamate (1 mm) also attenuated the activation of different isoforms of PKC, including PKCα, PKCβ, PKCγ, and PKCδ, and had a minor effect on Src kinase (Fig. 3).FIGURE 4NMDA receptor antagonists block the effect of glutamate on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and the PI3K/Akt pathway. Cultured hippocampal neurons were pretreated with the NMDA receptor antagonists MK801 or AP-5 (two selective NMDA receptor antagonists), or DNQX (antagonist for the non-MNDA receptor, AMPA, and kainate receptors), CPCCOEt (selective, non-competitive mGluI antagonist), and LY 341495 (mGluII/III antagonist), and the effect of glutamate (1 mm) on IGF-1R phosphorylation and the PI3K/Akt pathway was determined. Only the NMDA receptor antagonists MK801 and AP-5 significantly inhibited the effects of glutamate (A). MK801 also reversed the effect of glutamate on the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway induced by IGF-1 (B). Blots represent prototypical examples of experiments replicated at least three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Inhibitory Effect of Glutamate on IGF-1 Receptor Signaling Is Mediated by the NMDA Receptor—Knowing that glutamate is able to attenuate the IGF-1R/PI3K/Akt signaling survival pathway, we examined next the role of various glutamate receptor sub-types on this effect. Cultured hippocampal neurons were pretreated with the selective NMDA receptor antagonists MK801 or AP-5, DNQX (antagonist for the non-NMDA receptors, AMPA and kainate receptors), CPCCOEt (selective, non-competitive mGluI antagonist), and LY 341495 (mGluII/III antagonist), and the effect of glutamate (1 mm) on IGF-1R phosphorylation and signaling was determined. MK801 (20 μm), a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, inhibited the effect of glutamate, whereas AP-5, a competitive one, also blocked it but to a lesser extent. In contrast, DNQX at a concentration (20 μm) known to block non-NMDA receptors, had no effect (Fig. 4A). The metabotropic glutamate receptor subtypes antagonists CPCCOEt and LY 341495 also had no effect on the inhibitory effect of glutamate on IGF-1 signaling (data not shown). Consistent with the role of NMDA receptor on the effect of glutamate on IGF-1R signaling, Fig. 4B showed that 1 mm glutamate attenuates IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream targets GSK3β and FOXO3a, whereas pretreatment of hippocampal cultured neurons with this NMDA receptor antagonist reversed the effect of glutamate. On another hand, antagonists of non-NMDA receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors had no effect (Fig. 4B). NMDA Impairs the Signaling of IGF-1 Receptors in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—To verify further the role of the NMDA receptor subtype, the effect of NMDA itself was tested on IGF-1-induced receptor signaling. Fig. 5 shows that NMDA (1 mm) attenuated the phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and its downstream signaling proteins, including Akt. MK801 Reverses the Inhibitory Effects of Glutamate and NMDA on the Survival Properties of IGF-1—The effect of MK-801 on the inhibitory action of glutamate and NMDA on IGF-1R-mediated cell survival was investigated next. MK-801 (20 μm) significantly blocked the inhibitory effect of glutamate (0.3 mm) and NMDA (1 mm) on IGF-1-mediated cell survival (Fig. 6). Glutamate Stimulates the Phosphorylation/Activation of the Tyrosine Phosphatase SHP-2 While Its Inhibitor NaVO4 Attenuates the Effect of Glutamate—It was recently reported that the activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is able to dephosphorylate TrkB (29Rusanescu G. Yang W. Bai A. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the role of SHP-2 on the action of glutamate on IGF-1R signaling. Fig. 7A shows that glutamate is able to time dependently activate the phosphorylation and activation of SHP-2 while the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor NaVO4 attenuated the effect of glutamate on the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 7B) and IGF-1R (Fig. 7C). siRNA for SHP-2 Attenuated the Effect of Glutamate in Hippocampal Neurons Enhanced Its Effect—To further confirm the role of SHP-2, hippocampal neurons were transfected with a mixture of four siRNA for SHP-2 using Nucleofector technology. Fig. 8 shows that siRNA for SHP-2 inhibited the expression of SHP-2 and attenuated the effect of glutamate on the phosphorylation of IGF-1R. In the present study, we showed that glutamate, at concentrations not inducing excitotoxicity, is able to attenuate the survival effects of IGF-1. Glutamate acted by impairing IGF-1R coupling and signaling to the PI3K/Akt/FOXO pathway while possibly promoting IGF-1 action on the MAPK pathway. The effects of glutamate are mediated by the NMDA receptor subtype. Glutamate Inhibits the Survival Effect of IGF-1 in Hippocampal Neurons—The survival effect of IGF-1 was attenuated by a treatment with glutamate at concentrations as low as 100 μm. At such low concentrations, glutamate, by itself, had no apparent effect on cell survival suggesting that its effects were not due to excitotoxicity but to the inhibition of the survival properties of IGF-1. Our data also suggest that cell death inducers, such as glutamate, are not only able to activate pathways leading to cell death, but can also inhibit survival pathways hence amplifying their effects. Comparable findings have been reported from another group (37Garcia-Galloway E. Arango C. Pons S. Torres-Aleman I. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1027-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and for tumor necrosis factor-α, a pro-inflammatory cytokine known to mediate various forms of experimental neurodegeneration and to induce insulin/IGF-1 resistance in various tissues (30Hotamisligil G.S.

Mol. Cell Neurosci. 2003; 24: 1027-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Glutamate Impairs the Survival Signaling of IGF-1 at the Level of the IGF-1 Receptor—Exposure to glutamate significantly blocked the survival effects of IGF-1 by reducing IGF-1R signaling. This hypothesis is based on the following experimental results. First, glutamate, concentration dependently inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and of its adaptor protein IRS-1. Second, glutamate reduced the phosphorylation of PI3K and PDK1 (an upstream kinase of Akt), leading to reduced Akt activity via reduced phosphorylation. This event results in the activation of death effectors such as FOXO3a by reducing their phosphorylation. Third, the glutamate treatment preferentially affected the PI3K/Akt over the MAPK pathway. Hence, a pre-exposure to glutamate can reduce IGF-1 survival effect by directly altering IGF-1R phosphorylation and signal transduction. Consistent with our results, a recent report showed that glutamate was able to activate the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in cerebellar neurons, which enhanced the association of SHP-2 with TrkB, leading to the inhibition of the phosphorylation of this receptor and diminished trophic properties (29Rusanescu G. Yang W. Bai A. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, preliminary data also showed that glutamate is able to attenuate the phosphorylation of Akt induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor in hippocampal neurons. 3W. Zheng and R. Quirion, unpublished results. NMDA Receptors Mediate the Effect of Glutamate on IGF-1 Receptor Signaling and Survival—Specific antagonists of the various glutamate receptors were used to establish which subtype was responsible for the effects of glutamate on IGF-1R signaling and survival. Our data demonstrate that the NMDA receptor subtype likely plays a key role. Indeed, only the NMDA receptor antagonists MK801 and AP-5 inhibited the effects of glutamate on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-1R and its downstream signaling targets. Moreover, the specific agonist, NMDA, concentration dependently mimicked the effect of glutamate. Taken together, these data show that the NMDA receptor sub-type is involved in mediating the action of glutamate on IGF-1R signaling and cell survival. The one or more precise mechanisms underlying the effect of NMDA receptor activation on IGF-1R signaling and IGF-1-mediated cell survival are not clear. NMDA and IGF-1Rs do not directly interact with each other as coimmunoprecipitation using various NMDA and IGF-1R antibodies failed to reveal any direct interaction (data not shown). Accordingly, glutamate acting on NMDA receptors likely activates downstream signaling kinases that phosphorylate serine residues on IGF-1Rs leading to altered receptor tyrosine phosphorylation (38Maniar R. Pecherskaya A. Ila R. Solem M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2005; 275: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Alternatively, glutamate could activate phosphatases inducing IGF-1R dephosphorylation. The first hypothesis appears rather unlikely, because glutamate decreased the phosphorylation of classic PKC (this study). PKCs have been shown to be involved in the phosphorylation of serine residues of the IGF-1R in other cells (38Maniar R. Pecherskaya A. Ila R. Solem M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2005; 275: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, the inhibition of MAPK, a downstream effector of PKC, had no effect on the action of glutamate on IGF-1R signaling, although glutamate seems to enhance the activation of MAPK kinase. Further studies will be required to establish the functional significance of the effect seen here on the MAPK pathway. Phosphatases may be better candidates to explain the effects observed in the present study. Indeed, it has recently been shown that the activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 can dephosphorylate TrkB (29Rusanescu G. Yang W. Bai A. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). SHP-2 may also be involved in the phosphorylation of the IGF-1R (39Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Gamha A. van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 40Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8955-8960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In vitro, SHP-2 binds to both activated IGF-1 and dephosphorylated IGF-1Rs (39Rocchi S. Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Gamha A. van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), whereas in vivo, activated IGF-1Rs phosphorylate SHPS-1 (40Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8955-8960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of SHPS-1 promotes the recruitment of SHP-2 to the IGF-1R leading to receptor dephosphorylation (40Maile L.A. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8955-8960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, glutamate-activated SHP-2 could lead to the dephosphorylation of the IGF-1Rs and reduced signaling efficacy (29Rusanescu G. Yang W. Bai A. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the following results: (a) glutamate stimulated the phosphorylation of SHP-2; (b) knocking down the expression of SHP-2 by siRNA attenuated the inhibitory effect of glutamate on the phosphorylation of IGF-1R induced by IGF-1; and (c) the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, sodium vanadate, blocked the effect of glutamate on IGF-1-induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R and Akt. In summary, the present study reveals that glutamate, acting via the NMDA receptor sub-type, is capable of impairing IGF-1R signaling and survival effects in hippocampal neurons. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which glutamate can regulate neuronal viability by altering trophic factor receptor signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2122899135,"Dystroglycan is a ubiquitously expressed cell adhesion receptor best understood in its role as part of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex of mature skeletal muscle. Less is known of the role of dystroglycan in more fundamental aspects of cell adhesion in other cell types, nor of its role in myoblast cell adhesion.We have examined the role of dystroglycan in the early stages of myoblast adhesion and spreading and found that dystroglycan initially associates with other adhesion proteins in large puncta morphologically similar to podosomes. Using a human SH3 domain phage display library we identified Tks5, a key regulator of podosomes, as interacting with beta-dystroglycan. We verified the interaction by immunoprecipitation, GST-pulldown and immunfluorescence localisation. Both proteins localise to puncta during early phases of spreading, but importantly following stimulation with phorbol ester, also localise to structures indistinguishable from podosomes. Dystroglycan overexpression inhibited podosome formation by sequestering Tks5 and Src. Mutation of dystroglycan tyrosine 890, previously identified as a Src substrate, restored podosome formation.We propose therefore, that Src-dependent phosphorylation of beta-dystroglycan results in the formation of a Src/dystroglycan complex that drives the SH3-mediated association between dystroglycan and Tks5 which together regulate podosome formation in myoblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2090339110,"Imbalanced protease expression and activities may contribute to the development of cancers, including neuroblastoma (NB). NB is a fatal childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that frequently overexpresses mitogenic peptides, chemokines and their receptors. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), a cell surface serine protease, inactivates or degrades some of these bioactive peptides and chemokines, thereby regulating cell proliferation and survival. Our studies show that DPPIV is expressed in normal neural crest-derived structures, including superior cervical and dorsal root ganglion cells, sciatic nerve, and in adrenal glands, but its expression is greatly decreased or lost in cells derived from NB, their malignant counterpart. Restoration of DPPIV expression in NB cells led to their differentiation in association with increased expression of the neural marker MAP2 and decreased expression of chemokines, including stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF1) and its receptor CXCR4. Furthermore, DPPIV promoted apoptosis, and inhibited SDF1-mediated in vitro cell migration and angiogenic potential. These changes were accompanied by caspase activation and decreased levels of phospho-Akt and MMP9 activity, which are downstream effectors of SDF1-CXCR4 signaling. Importantly, DPPIV suppressed the tumorigenic potential of NB cells in a xenotransplantation mouse model. These data support a potential role for DPPIV in inhibiting NB growth and progression."
https://openalex.org/W1993254986,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a major effector molecule in cancer prevention. A number of studies have shown that NO prodrug JS-K (O2-(2,4-dinitrophenyl) 1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate) induces apoptotic cell death in vitro and in vivo, indicating that it is a promising new therapeutic for cancer. However, the mechanism of its tumor-killing activity remains unclear. Ubiquitin plays an important role in the regulation of tumorigenesis and cell apoptosis. Our earlier report has shown that inactivation of the ubiquitin system through blocking E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme) activity preferentially induces apoptosis in p53-expressing transformed cells. As E1 has an active cysteine residue that could potentially interact with NO, we hypothesized that JS-K could inactivate E1 activity. E1 activity was evaluated by detecting ubiquitin-E1 conjugates through immunoblotting. JS-K strikingly inhibits the ubiquitin-E1 thioester formation in cells in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50 of approximately 2 μM, whereas a JS-K analog that cannot release NO did not affect these levels in cells. Moreover, JS-K decreases total ubiquitylated proteins and increases p53 levels, which is mainly regulated by ubiquitin and proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, JS-K preferentially induces cell apoptosis in p53-expressing transformed cells. These findings indicate that JS-K inhibits E1 activity and kills transformed cells harboring wild-type p53."
https://openalex.org/W2126783061,"Background One of the hallmarks of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is hyperplasia and inflammation of the synovial tissue being characterized by in situ occurrence of highly differentiated leukocytes. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) has a crucial role in hematopoiesis, regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Typically, Flt3 is expressed on early myeloid and lymphoid progenitors and is activated by its soluble ligand (Flt3-L). The highly differentiated cellular pattern in the synovium of the RA patients made us hypothesize that Flt3-L, with its ability to induce proliferation and differentiation, could be of importance in induction and/or progression of arthritis. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate occurrence of Flt3-L in RA we have measured its levels in matched serum and synovial fluid samples from 130 patients and 107 controls. To analyse the pro-inflammatory role of Flt3-L, we continuously overexpressed this protein locally in healthy mouse joints using homologous B-cell line transfected with Flt3-L gene. Additionally, recombinant Flt3-L was instillated intra-articularly in combination with peptidoglycans, a Toll Like Receptor 2-ligand with stong arthritogenic properties. Our results show significantly higher levels of Flt3-L in the synovial fluid as compared to serum levels in RA subjects (p = 0.0001). In addition, RA synovial fluid levels of Flt-3-L were significantly higher than these obtained from synovial fluids originating from non-inflammatory joint diseases (p = 0.022). Intra-articular administration of B-cell line transfected with Flt3-L gene resulted in highly erosive arthritis while inoculation of the same B-cell line without hyperexpression of Flt3-L did not induce erosivity and only in a minority of cases caused synovial proliferation! Flt3-ligand potentiated peptidoglycan induced arthritis as compared to mice injected with peptidoglycan alone (p<0.05). Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that Flt3-L is strongly expressed at the site of inflammation in human RA. It exerts both pro-inflammatory and tissue destructive properties once in the joint cavity. Owing to these properties, treatment attempts to neutralize this molecule should be considered in RA."
https://openalex.org/W2019890253,"We have previously shown that IκB kinase-β (IKKβ) interacts with the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) β-subunit and enhances ENaC activity by increasing its surface expression in Xenopus oocytes. Here, we show that the IKKβ-ENaC interaction is physiologically relevant in mouse polarized kidney cortical collecting duct (mpkCCDc14) cells, as RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous IKKβ in these cells by ∼50% resulted in a similar reduction in transepithelial ENaC-dependent equivalent short circuit current. Although IKKβ binds to ENaC, there was no detectable phosphorylation of ENaC subunits by IKKβ in vitro. Because IKKβ stimulation of ENaC activity occurs through enhanced channel surface expression and the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 has emerged as a central locus for ENaC regulation at the plasma membrane, we tested the role of Nedd4-2 in this regulation. IKKβ-dependent phosphorylation of Xenopus Nedd4-2 expressed in HEK-293 cells occurred both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a potential mechanism for regulation of Nedd4-2 and thus ENaC activity. 32P labeling studies utilizing wild-type or mutant forms of Xenopus Nedd4-2 demonstrated that Ser-444, a key SGK1 and protein kinase A-phosphorylated residue, is also an important IKKβ phosphorylation target. ENaC stimulation by IKKβ was preserved in oocytes expressing wild-type Nedd4-2 but blocked in oocytes expressing either a dominant-negative (C938S) or phospho-deficient (S444A) Nedd4-2 mutant, suggesting that Nedd4-2 function and phosphorylation by IKKβ are required for IKKβ regulation of ENaC.

Hallows K.R. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2008; 19: 1845-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). ENaC is therefore critical to the regulation of extracellular and airway fluid volume (1Bhalla V.

Moreover, expression of a kinase-dead IKKβ had the opposite effect of decreasing ENaC activity, implying that tonic activation of IKKβ may be required for a significant proportion of basal ENaC activity (10Lebowitz J.

IKKβ is a part of the IKK complex formed by IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (or NEMO, the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) essential modulator), which mediates the activation of the NF-κB pathway by proinflammatory cytokines, bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and other stimuli such as heat shock or oxidative stress (11Zandi E.

Interaction between this canonical proinflammatory and stress signaling pathway and ENaC function has been suggested by a number of observations and appears to be biphasic. Acute exposure to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α has been shown to increase amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport in alveolar epithelium (13Fukuda N. Jayr C. Lazrak A. Wang Y. Lucas R. Matalon S.

In contrast, prolonged (12–24 h) exposure of alveolar epithelial cells to tumor necrosis factor-α (17Dagenais A. Frechette R. Yamagata Y. Yamagata T. Carmel J.F. Clermont M.E. Brochiero E. Masse C.

We have found that aldosterone, the major hormonal regulator of ENaC, increases IKKβ levels in renal epithelia and activates NF-κB and have suggested that long term stimulation of NF-κB might represent a negative feedback loop modulating long term ENaC activation in conditions of oxidative or metabolic stress (10Lebowitz J.

Despite evidence of cross-talk between the IKK complex and ENaC-mediated Na+ transport, the significance of the interaction between IKKβ and ENaC remains unclear, as does the potential mechanism of IKKβ-dependent up-regulation of ENaC activity. The current studies were performed to examine whether ENaC is a substrate for IKKβ phosphorylation, the significance of the IKKβ-ENaC interaction in natively expressing cells, and the mechanism by which IKKβ regulates ENaC expression. We have found that IKK-dependent regulation of ENaC is physiologically relevant in mouse kidney collecting duct cells and that the regulatory mechanism involves phosphorylation of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 by IKKβ at a previously identified SGK1 and PKA phosphorylation site. Reagents, Chemicals, and Cell Culture—All reagents and chemicals used were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Plasmids expressing NH2-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged and COOH-terminal V5-tagged ENaC subunits were kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Kleyman. HEK-293 and mpkCCDc14 cells were cultured in high glucose, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium and defined medium supplemented with hormones and nutrients, respectively, as described previously (7Carattino M.D. Edinger R.S. Grieser H.J. Wise R. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Johnson J.P. Kleyman T.R. Hallows K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17608-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). RNA Interference Knockdown of IKKβ in mpkCCDc14 Cells—Approximately 2 × 106 cells at 80–90% confluency were trypsinized and then resuspended in Nucleofector T solution containing 100 pmol of either SMARTpool® siRNA IKKβ (mixtures of sequences 5′-GGAAGUACCUGAACCAGUU-3′, 5′-CCAAUAAUCUUAACAGUGU-3′, 5′-GGAUUCAGCUUCUCCUAAA-3′, and 5′-GUGGUGAGCUUAAUGAAUG-3′) or siGENOME® non-targeting siRNA (mixtures of sequences 5′-UAGCGACUAAACACAUCAA-3′, 5′-UAAGGCUAUGAAGAGAUAC-3′, 5′-AUGUAUUGGCCUGUAUUAG-3′, and 5′-AUGAACGUGAAUUGCUCAA-3′) (Thermo Fisher/Dharmacon). Following the manufacturer’s instructions, these were mixed in the cuvette and directly placed in the Nucleofector® electroporation device (Amaxa Biosystems). The siRNA oligonucleotides were electroporated into the cells using Amaxa Program K-29. An equal volume of warm culture medium was added, and the cell suspension was then plated on a plastic 12-well plate containing 2 ml of culture medium. The following day, the cells were trypsinized and plated onto 12-mm filter inserts (Costar Transwells) at superconfluency. Two to four days later, the cells were used for electrophysiological and biochemical studies. Equivalent Short-circuit Current Measurements—A portable epithelial volt ohmmeter was used to measure Isc across polarized mpkCCDc14 cell monolayers as described (19Mohan S. Bruns J.R. Weixel K.M.

Amiloride-sensitive equivalent Isc was calculated as the difference in equivalent Isc measured before versus after addition of 10 μm amiloride to the apical medium. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—For in vitro phosphorylation assays of ENaC, plasmids expressing NH2-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged and COOH-terminal V5-tagged ENaC subunits were translated in vitro using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) in the presence or absence of [35S]Met/Cys following the manufacturer’s instructions. ENaC subunits were immobilized using 1 μl of anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) per reaction coupled to protein A/G beads (15-μl bead volume; Pierce). In vitro phosphorylation was performed by adding 1 μl of purified active IKKβ enzyme (Upstate) versus control buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol) with [γ-32P]ATP (20 μCi; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) at room temperature for 1 h. As a positive control for ENaC phosphorylation, parallel in vitro phosphorylation of β-ENaC was performed using 1 μl of purified casein kinase-2 (Promega) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. As a positive control for IKKβ activity, another parallel in vitro phosphorylation was performed using glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pierce) to pull down purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged IκBα (Upstate) for use as a reaction substrate. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, phosphorylated bands on the membrane were imaged by exposure to a phospho-screen (Molecular Dynamics), and the bands were quantitated using a Bio-Rad phosphorimaging device. Assays of Nedd4-2 in vitro phosphorylation were performed as described previously (20Bhalla V. Oyster N.M. Fitch A.C. Wijngaarden M.A. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Pearce D. Hallows K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26159-26169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). HEK-293T cells transiently transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA/60-mm dish using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to express wild-type or mutant FLAG-xNedd4-2 were lysed 1 day after transfection. Nedd4-2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates using 1 μl of anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 coupled to protein A/G beads (20-μl bead volume). In vitro phosphorylation reactions were performed as above using either purified active IKKβ enzyme or control buffer. As a positive control for FLAG-xNedd4-2 phosphorylation, parallel in vitro phosphorylations were performed using 1 μl of purified SGK1 (Upstate). As a positive control to check IKKβ enzymatic activity, GST-tagged IκBα was again used as a reaction substrate. After SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblotting for expression of FLAG-xNedd4-2 was first performed (anti-Nedd4 WW2 domain antibody (Upstate) at 1:10,000 and secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at 1:5000) and quantitated using a Versa-Doc imager with Quantity One software (BioRad). After the chemiluminescent signal had decayed, phosphorylated bands on the membrane were imaged by exposure to a phospho-screen, and the bands were quantitated using a Bio-Rad phosphorimaging device. The intensity of each band was corrected by subtracting out the local background in the same lane. In Vivo Phosphorylation Assays—In vivo phosphorylation assays were performed based on our previously described protocol (20Bhalla V. Oyster N.M. Fitch A.C. Wijngaarden M.A. Neumann D. Schlattner U.

Either Mam-X (stably transfected with a short hairpin RNA that does not target any known mammalian gene), HEK-293 cells, or HEK-293T cells were transiently co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 with the pMO-FLAG-xNedd4-2 plasmid and either SMARTpool® IKKβ siRNA or siGENOME® non-targeting siRNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions 2 days prior to experimentation. For labeling, cells were washed twice in phosphate-free efflux buffer containing 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (with 1 m Tris base). Each dish of cells was then incubated at 37 °C for 3 h in 1.5 ml of this buffer containing 0.3 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (MP Biomedicals). After incubation, cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-free buffer before lysis in ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1% Triton X-100 (phosphatase and protease inhibitors added just prior to use). After clearing the lysates by high speed centrifugation, FLAG-xNedd4-2 was immunoprecipitated using the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 coupled to protein A/G beads, washed, eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Nedd4-2 Western blotting was performed first, followed by a phosphorimaging device analysis of the same membrane. The ratio of the phosphorylation signal to the immunoblot signal in each lane was compared across conditions to derive relative phosphorylation levels. Oocyte Two-electrode Voltage Clamp Measurements—Xenopus laevis oocytes were harvested, collagenase-treated, and maintained as described previously (7Carattino M.D. Edinger R.S. Grieser H.J. Wise R.

Oocytes were injected with cRNAs encoding mouse α-, β-, and γ-ENaC (7Carattino M.D. Edinger R.S. Grieser H.J. Wise R. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Johnson J.P. Kleyman T.R. Hallows K.R. J. Biol.

Two-electrode voltage clamp measurements of amiloride-sensitive ENaC currents in oocytes were performed 1–2 days after cRNA injection as described previously (7Carattino M.D. Edinger R.S. Grieser H.J. Wise R. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Johnson J.P. Kleyman T.R. Hallows K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17608-17616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Statistics—Statistical analyses were performed using either StatView (SAS) or SigmaPlot software (Jandel Scientific). Analysis of variance was used to compare data obtained from different batches of oocytes for two-electrode voltage clamp experiments. For other biochemical experiments, statistics were performed using Student’s t tests, as described in each figure legend. In all cases, p values <0.05 were considered significant. Endogenous Regulation of ENaC by IKKβ in mpkCCDc14 Cells—We previously discovered that IKKβ interacts with the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of β-ENaC through a yeast two-hybrid screen, and this interaction was confirmed biochemically through co-immunoprecipitation studies. Functionally, IKKβ co-expression was found to enhance ENaC activity by increasing its surface expression in Xenopus oocytes (10Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S. An B. Perry C.J. Onate S. Kleyman T.R. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41985-41990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test whether the regulation of ENaC by IKKβ is physiologically relevant in an endogenously expressing cell system, we used polarized mpkCCDc14 cells and knocked down IKKβ expression through RNA interference (Fig. 1). Transfection of siRNAs directed specifically against IKKβ knocked down its protein expression by a mean of ∼40–50% relative to control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1, A and B). Concomitant with this knockdown of IKKβ expression, amiloride-sensitive, ENaC-dependent equivalent Isc was similarly reduced by ∼50% (Fig. 1C). These findings suggest that IKKβ expression in these cells is required to sustain ENaC currents under basal conditions; when IKKβ levels are reduced, ENaC activity is also inhibited. IKKβ Does Not Directly Phosphorylate ENaC in Vitro—As IKKβ is a kinase that binds to β-ENaC, we next tested whether any of the ENaC subunits may serve as direct substrates for IKKβ phosphorylation in vitro. In vitro transcribed and translated epitope-tagged mouse α-, β-, or γ-ENaC subunits were immunoprecipitated and then incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of purified IKKβ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Fig. 2). [35S]Met/Cys labeling of ENaC was performed for some samples so that the ENaC subunit mobilities could be assessed on the membrane. No appreciable 32P incorporation into ENaC was apparent in the samples exposed to IKKβ, yet IKKβ autophosphorylation bands were observed at ∼90 kDa, as indicated in Fig. 2A. The presence of co-precipitated IKKβ confirms that this kinase binds to both α- and β-ENaC and, to a much lesser extent, γ-ENaC, findings consistent with our earlier work (10Lebowitz J. Edinger R.S. An B. Perry C.J. Onate S. Kleyman T.R. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41985-41990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). GST-tagged IκBα was used as an additional positive control to demonstrate IKKβ activity, and casein kinase-2 was used as a positive control to demonstrate phosphorylation of ENaC by another kinase (Fig. 2B). Similar negative ENaC in vitro phosphorylation data were derived from experiments where ENaC subunits were transiently expressed in HEK-293 cells and then immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prior to performing in vitro phosphorylation assays (data not shown). The failure of IKKβ to phosphorylate ENaC in vitro suggests that its regulation of ENaC is indirect, not occurring through direct phosphorylation of the channel. IKKβ-dependent Phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 in Vitro and in Vivo—We have previously reported that IKKβ stimulation of ENaC activity occurs through enhanced channel plasma membrane expression in Xenopus oocytes (10Lebowitz J.

As the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4-2 has emerged as a central locus for the regulation of ENaC expression at the apical plasma membrane (21Snyder P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5079-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), we considered that ENaC regulation by IKKβ may be mediated indirectly through Nedd4-2. Of note, Nedd4-2 has been recently reported to be a substrate for various kinases, including SGK1, PKA, AMPK, and Grk2, which may modulate Nedd4-2 function (3Debonneville C. Flores S.Y. Kamynina E. Plant P.J. Tauxe C. Thomas M.A. Munster C. Chraibi A. Pratt J.H. Horisberger J.D. Pearce D. Loffing J. Staub O. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7052-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 4Snyder P.M.

Cook D.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 359: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test whether IKKβ phosphorylates Nedd4-2 in vitro, FLAG-xNedd4-2 was expressed in and immunoprecipitated from HEK-293 cell lysates, and in vitro phosphorylation assays were performed (Fig. 3). As a positive control for Nedd4-2 phosphorylation, we confirmed that purified SGK1 robustly phosphorylated xNedd4-2 (Fig. 3, upper panel, left). IKKβ similarly phosphorylated xNedd4-2 (Fig. 3, upper panel, middle) and its positive control, GST-tagged IκBα (upper panel, right). As observed in Fig. 2, autophosphorylation of IKKβ was also detected in these assays. To determine whether IKKβ-dependent phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 occurs in intact cells, in vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate of HEK-293 cells expressing xNedd4-2 was performed under control conditions, after IKKβ protein expression was knocked down by RNA interference (Fig. 4A), or after overnight stimulation by 100 ng/ml LPS, an upstream activator of the IKK/NF-κB pathway. After immunoprecipitation of FLAG-xNedd4-2 from cell lysates, immunoblotting was performed first, followed by a phosphorimaging device analysis of the same membrane (Fig. 4B). The ratio of the phosphorylation signal to the immunoblot signal in each lane was compared across conditions to derive relative phosphorylation levels (Fig. 4C). Knockdown of IKKβ reduced in vivo [32P]orthophosphate incorporation into xNedd4-2 by 33 ± 8% relative to control siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4C, left). Conversely, LPS stimulation of these cells enhanced in vivo [32P]orthophosphate labeling of xNedd4-2 by 57 ± 19% (Fig. 4C, right). Taken together, these data indicate that IKKβ-dependent phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 occurs both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a potential mechanism for regulation of Nedd4-2 and thus ENaC activity by IKKβ. Identification of Ser-444 in xNedd4-2 as the Target for IKKβ Phosphorylation in Vitro and in Vivo—Although several IKKβ target phosphorylation sites have been identified within various components of the NF-κB·IκB protein complex (11Zandi E.

It has been shown previously that both SGK1 and PKA stimulate ENaC activity via phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 at two key residues, Ser-338 and Ser-444 (Xenopus numbering), which has an inhibitory effect on Nedd4-2 function (3Debonneville C.

https://openalex.org/W2039393623,"Background In dystrophic skeletal muscle, osmotic stimuli somehow relieve inhibitory control of dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) on spontaneous sarcoplasmic reticulum elementary Ca2+ release events (ECRE) in high Ca2+ external environments. Such ‘uncontrolled’ Ca2+ sparks were suggested to act as dystrophic signals. They may be related to mechanosensitive pathways but the mechanisms are elusive. Also, it is not known whether truncated dystrophins can correct the dystrophic disinhibition. Methodology/Principal Findings We recorded ECRE activity in single intact fibers from adult wt, mdx and mini-dystrophin expressing mice (MinD) under resting isotonic conditions and following hyper-/hypo-osmolar external shock using confocal microscopy and imaging techniques. Isotonic ECRE frequencies were small in wt and MinD fibers, but were markedly increased in mdx fibers. Osmotic challenge dramatically increased ECRE activity in mdx fibers. Sustained osmotic challenge induced marked exponential ECRE activity adaptation that was three times faster in mdx compared to wt and MinD fibers. Rising external Ca2+ concentrations amplified osmotic ECRE responses. The eliminated ECRE suppression in intact osmotically stressed mdx fibers was completely and reversibly resuscitated by streptomycine (200 µM), spider peptide GsMTx-4 (5 µM) and Gd3+ (20 µM) that block unspecific, specific cationic and Ca2+ selective mechanosensitive channels (MsC), respectively. ECRE morphology was not substantially altered by membrane stress. During hyperosmotic challenge, membrane potentials were polarised and a putative depolarisation through aberrant MsC negligible excluding direct activation of ECRE through tubular depolarisation. Conclusions/Significance Dystrophin suppresses spontaneous ECRE activity by control of mechanosensitive pathways which are suggested to interact with the inhibitory DHPR loop to the ryanodine receptor. MsC-related disinhibition prevails in dystrophic muscle and can be resuscitated by transgenic mini-dystrophin expression. Our results have important implications for the pathophysiology of DMD where abnormal MsC in dystrophic muscle confer disruption of microdomain Ca2+ homeostasis. MsC blockers should have considerable therapeutic potential if more muscle specific compounds can be found."
https://openalex.org/W1999627231,"Spt5 is a conserved essential protein that represses or stimulates transcription elongation in vitro. Immunolocalization studies on Drosophila polytene chromosomes suggest that Spt5 is associated with many loci throughout the genome. However, little is known about the prevalence and identity of Spt5 target genes in vivo during development. Here, we identify direct target genes of Spt5 using fog(sk8) zebrafish mutant, which disrupts the foggy/spt5 gene. We identified that fog(sk8) and their wildtype siblings differentially express less than 5% of genes examined. These genes participate in diverse biological processes from stress response to cell fate specification. Up-regulated genes exhibit shorter overall gene length compared to all genes examined. Through chromatin immunoprecipitation in zebrafish embryos, we identified a subset of developmentally critical genes that are bound by both Spt5 and RNA polymerase II. The protein occupancy patterns on these genes are characteristic of both repressive and stimulatory elongation regulation. Together our findings establish Spt5 as a dual regulator of transcription elongation in vivo and identify a small but diverse set of target genes critically dependent on Spt5 during development."

Binns K. Lemberg M.K. Ashman K. Martoglio B. Science. 2002; 296: 2215-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). This enzyme was named signal peptide peptidase (SPP) and later shown to be the founding member of a larger protease family. Only a subset of SP substrates are also substrates for SPP; cleavage requires the presence of polar amino acids in the membrane-spanning sequence (5Lemberg M.K. Martoglio B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 735-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The primary purpose of this intramembrane cleavage event was thought to be the clearance of signal peptides from the ER membrane, but cytoplasmic signaling functions of the released peptides have also been proposed (6Martoglio B.

However, the reason for the lethality is unknown, and to date no endogenous nonsignal sequence substrates for SPP cleavage have been identified. The SPP family of enzymes represents the most recent addition to a class of structurally related intramembrane proteases, including rhomboids, the Site-2-Protease S2P, and presenilins, which mediate regulated intramembrane proteolysis, an important theme in proteolysis-dependent cell signaling (11Brown M.S.

For example, membrane proteins of Semliki forest virus are translated as one large polyprotein precursor from which mature p62, 6k, and E1 proteins are released by SP cleavage (25Liljestrom P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to signal peptides in cellular proteins, the SP cleavage sites are found not at the N terminus but rather internally within the polyprotein sequence. Similarly, an internal signal sequence targets the hepatitis C virus polyprotein to the ER (26Santolini E. Migliaccio G. La Monica N. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3631-3641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where the core and envelope proteins are formed by the sequential action of SP and SPP. The envelope protein E1 becomes a transmembrane protein that is targeted to the plasma membrane, whereas the core protein is released into the cytoplasmic matrix where it associates with lipid droplets (27McLauchlan J.

Because internal cleavable signal sequences are thought to be restricted to viral polyproteins, it has been assumed that polyprotein precursors of cellular proteins cannot be similarly converted into functionally distinct proteins by SP and SPP processing. We investigated the biosynthesis and processing of IgSF1 (p120/inhibin-binding protein), an Ig domain protein that is highly expressed in the pituitary and brain (29Bernard D.J. Woodruff T.K. Mol.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 214: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several previous findings highlighted potential functions of IgSF1 in cell signaling. Pituitary Igsf1 mRNA levels are dynamically regulated during the rat estrous cycle (29Bernard D.J. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 654-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the IgSF1 protein has been proposed to associate with transforming growth factor β receptors (33Chapman S.C. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 668-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, in recent studies we observed that IgSF1 expression was dramatically up-regulated in the developing pontocerebellar system during neuronal synapse formation (34Diaz E. Ge Y. Yang Y.H.

Sequence analysis suggested that IgSF1 is a type I transmembrane protein with an N-terminal signal sequence, followed by 11 Ig domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail (30Chong H.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 214: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). We show here that two additional hydrophobic domains in the center of the IgSF1 polypeptide act as stop transfer and internal signal sequences. Sequential proteolytic processing by SP and SPP generates two Ig domain proteins, each with a single transmembrane domain. Our results demonstrate that processing of internal signal sequences is not restricted to viral polyproteins and expand SP and SPP function to the generation of cellular proteins. DNA Constructs and Antibody Reagents—A construct encoding full-length human IgSF1 with a triple HA tag on the C terminus was a gift of Dr. Teresa Woodruff (Northwestern University). Mouse SHPS1 and CD47 cDNAs were isolated by reverse transcription-PCR from hippocampal total RNA. 5B. Chih, unpublished observations. An amyloid precursor protein expression construct was kindly provided by Dr. Tae-Wan Kim. All of the expression constructs contained the cytomegalovirus promoter for eukaryotic expression. See the supplemental material for details on the construction of DNA vectors. Two anti-peptide antibodies were raised for detection of IgSF1. N-terminal domain antibodies were generated in guinea pigs using a synthetic peptide representing amino acids 21–35 (SLAVESQPELWIESN), and central domain antibodies were generated against a synthetic peptide representing amino acids 559–575 (ALTEEIEIVMPTKPEL). Each peptide was synthesized with an additional cysteine at its C terminus for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and antibodies were affinity-purified on the antigen coupled to Sulfo-link beads (Pierce). Rat anti-HA and mouse anti-Myc antibodies were obtained from Roche Applied Science and Zymed Laboratories Inc., respectively. Mouse anti-actin antibodies were from Sigma. Secondary antibodies raised in donkey were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Tissue Preparation—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293), Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), and COS7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). All animal use was approved by and according to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Columbia University. IgSF1-/- mutant mice were bred and genotyped as described previously (35Bernard D.J. Burns K.H. Haupt B. Matzuk M.M. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Adult mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation. Fresh pituitaries were dissected on ice and solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce) prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein Analysis Methods—For deglycosylation experiments, the protein concentration of cell lysates was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). For each sample, lysate containing 20 μg of protein was denatured in SDS-containing buffer (New England Biolabs) for 10 min. The lysates were then treated with 500 units of endoglycosidase H or PNGase F (New England Biolabs) for 1–2 h at 37 °C and analyzed by Western blotting. Because the N-terminal IgSF1 fragment tends to aggregate upon boiling, the protein samples were only heated to 37 °C before analysis by SDS-PAGE. (ZLL)2-ketone and Compound E (Calbiochem) were added to cells 10–12 h before analysis at 100 μm and 10 nm, respectively. To separate SPP-cleaved and uncleaved N-terminal fragments, the protein samples were separated on 15% Tris-Tricine gels. For pulse-chase analysis, transfected HEK293 cells were starved for 2 h in cysteine/methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and then pulsed for 10 min with 14.3 μCi of 35S-radiolabeled cysteine/methionine (Pro-Mix; Amersham Biosciences). The cells were washed once and left in media supplemented with 40 μg/ml each of unlabeled cysteine and methionine. After the indicated chase times, the cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS and collected in lysis buffer (PBS, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol; Complete protease inhibitor mixture). Proteins were immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates with control or anti-HA antibodies, antibody complexes were collected with protein G beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences), beads were washed five times in lysis buffer, and precipitated proteins were eluted in Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were visualized by autoradiography. For immunofluorescence analysis, the cells were fixed for 10 min with phosphate-buffered 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 or left unpermeabilized, blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 10% goat serum, and incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. For detection, cross-absorbed CY2- and CY3-conjugated secondary antibodies were used (Jackson Immunoresearch), and the cells were imaged on a Zeiss LSM 510meta confocal microscope. In Vitro Translocation Assays—Wild-type and 4xY mutant IgSF1, in which four residues near the SP cleavage site have been replaced by tyrosines (see supplemental material for details) were synthesized in vitro using 500 ng of plasmid DNA and complete amino acid mix, following the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system protocol (Promega). For translocation assays, canine pancreatic microsomes (Promega) were included in the reactions (1.8 μl/25-μl reaction; increasing the amount of microsomes did not increase the efficiency of translocation; data not shown). IgSF1-containing TnT lysates were deglycosylated with PNGaseF or EndoH following the manufacturer's protocol, with minor changes. Wild-type TnT-IgSF1 (with microsomes) samples were denatured at 100 °C for 10 min in the denaturation buffer provided by the manufacturer. 4xY mutant TnT-IGSF1 (with microsomes) samples were denatured at 70 °C for 20 min to reduce aggregation of the protein. The proteins were resolved on NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gradient gels in MOPS buffer (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol with minor alterations. Deglycosylated samples were reheated at 37 °C prior to loading onto the gels. Nondeglycosylated samples were heated at 70 °C for 10 min. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (30 V, 1 h), and the membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBST (0.05% Tween in TBS). The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C in mouse anti-HA (1:40,000, Sigma). The following day, the membranes were washed three times for 15 min in TBST and incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (Bio-Rad; 1:3,000 in 5% milk). The membranes were washed three times for 15 min in TBST, followed by incubation in Amersham ECL Plus reagent and exposure to x-ray film (GE Healthcare). All of the experiments described in this study were repeated at least three times. The repetitions yielded highly similar results, and the data included in the manuscript are representative for these independent experiments. IgSF1 Is Subject to Internal Proteolytic Cleavage—We raised polyclonal antibodies to study the biosynthesis and processing of IgSF1. Specific antisera were obtained for two peptide epitopes: one located at the mature N terminus of the protein and one located in the presumptive center of the coding sequences. Surprisingly, affinity-purified antisera detected proteins of different molecular masses from mouse pituitary. The N-terminal domain (NTD) antibody detected a protein migrating at ∼60–70 kDa, whereas the C-terminal domain (CTD) antibody detected a doublet migrating at ∼130–150 kDa. These apparent molecular masses reflect the masses of glycosylated proteins and thus are larger than the predicted molecular masses as illustrated in the diagram (Fig. 1A). This fact will be further examined below (see Fig. 3). Immune reactivity for both products was absent or strongly reduced in lysates of pituitary tissue from knock-out mice lacking the first (noncoding) exon of the Igsf1 gene (35Bernard D.J. Burns K.H. Haupt B. Matzuk M.M. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), demonstrating the specificity of the antibody detection (Fig. 1B). Multiple IgSF1 transcripts have been identified in pituitary (29Bernard D.J. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 654-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 35Bernard D.J. Burns K.H. Haupt B. Matzuk M.M. Woodruff T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4882-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To examine whether the NTD and CTD proteins are the products of separate transcripts or processing of a single polypeptide, we probed cell lysates of HEK293 cells transfected with an expression construct encoding the full-length human IgSF1 mRNA (Fig. 1B). As observed for the endogenous protein, two protein species were generated from this cDNA, strongly supporting the idea that proteolytic processing of an IgSF1 precursor gives rise to the two protein isoforms. We further probed the subcellular localization of the IgSF1 products by immunofluorescence analysis of COS7 cells transfected with the same full-length IgSF1 expression construct (Fig. 1C). Staining of permeabilized cells with the NTD and CTD antibodies revealed partially nonoverlapping localization of these proteins. Whereas both antibodies detected intracellular pools of the protein in the ER, only the CTD antibody detected protein in nonpermeabilized cells. This suggests that the N-terminal protein product might be retained intracellularly, whereas the CTD protein is targeted to the plasma membrane. The apparent processing of IgSF1 was further examined using a dually tagged IgSF1 cDNA (Fig. 2A). A Myc tag was introduced after the N-terminal signal sequence, and a triple HA epitope was inserted at the C terminus. Immunoblotting with anti-Myc and anti-HA antibodies confirmed that IgSF1 underwent proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 2B). The HA-tagged (C-terminal) fragment had the same molecular mass as the protein detected with the CTD antibody, whereas the Myc-tagged fragment corresponded in size to the protein detected by the NTD antibody. Taken together with the findings on the endogenous protein, this indicates that IgSF1 is cleaved into at least two fragments, one containing the C terminus and the other containing the N terminus of the original polyprotein. Interestingly, the protein fragments also differed in their carbohydrate modifications (Fig. 2B). A substantial portion of the HA-tagged (C-terminal) protein acquired EndoH-resistant N-glycans, whereas the glycans on the Myc-tagged (N-terminal) protein remained fully EndoH-sensitive consistent with its predicted retention in the ER. The retention of the NTD in the ER (Fig. 1C) and the lack of EndoH-resistant carbohydrates suggested that cleavage of the IgSF1 precursor protein might occur early in the secretory pathway. To explore the kinetics of IgSF1 precursor cleavage, transfected HEK293 cells were pulsed with radiolabeled methionine and cysteine for 5 min, and IgSF1 was immunoprecipitated either with antibodies against the C-terminal HA tag or with a control antibody (Fig. 2C). Precipitates were treated with either EndoH or PNGase F to discriminate size variations caused by changes in the protein backbone and N-glycosylation. Even when proteins were precipitated immediately after the pulse (0 min), no IgSF1 precursor was recovered. After the 120-min chase, 30% of IgSF1 had acquired complex carbohydrates, indicating transport to the Golgi complex, and ∼75% had acquired EndoH resistance in samples metabolically labeled overnight (Fig. 2C). These findings strongly suggest that proteolytic cleavage of IgSF1 occurs co-translationally or very soon after translation of the full-length protein. IgSF1 Contains an Internal Signal Sequence—Based on the apparent molecular masses of the N- and C-terminal fragments, as well as the location of the epitope localized by the CTD antibody, we predicted that the cleavage site should be located within amino acids 400–560 of full-length IgSF1. This region contains two hydrophobic domains, the second of which bears a strong similarity to that of an N-terminal signal peptide. It contains a positively charged n-region, a central hydrophobic h-region, and a polar C-terminal c-region (predictions with Signal P 3.0; Fig. 3A) (3von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1516) Google Scholar, 36Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5586) Google Scholar, 37Haeuptle M.T. Flint N. Gough N.M. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1227-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To test whether this hydrophobic region was indeed capable of functioning as a signal peptide, we constructed a truncated IgSF1 expression construct (IgSF1-ΔN) where the N-terminal signal sequence, the first five Ig domains, and the first hydrophobic domain were deleted (Fig. 3B). When expressed in COS7 cells, IgSF1-ΔN acquired complex EndoH–resistant carbohydrate modifications and was efficiently transported to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, B and C). This demonstrates that the second internal hydrophobic domain in IgSF1 represents a functional signal sequence when placed at the N terminus of a protein and is sufficient to direct translocation and subsequent cleavage by SP. We speculated that this sequence also might direct cleavage of the full-length protein. The Internal Signal Sequence in IgSF1 Is Sufficient to Direct Site-specific Cleavage of Membrane Proteins—To test directly whether the internal signal sequence in IgSF1 is sufficient to confer proteolytic cleavage, we generated a series of chimeric molecules using sequences from IgSF1 and SHPS-1 (SHP substrate 1), a type I transmembrane protein with an N-terminal signal sequence, three extracellular Ig domains, and a single transmembrane domain. In the chimera SHPS1-IgSF1, the two hydrophobic segments and the adjacent c-region of IgSF1 were fused into SHPS-1 (Fig. 4A). As a negative control, we transplanted two hydrophobic segments (a stop transfer and a start transfer sequence) of the polytopic plasma membrane protein CD47 in the same position (SHPS1-CD47). The hydrophobic domains of IgSF1 were further dissected in three additional chimeras. In CD47/IgSF1, the second hydrophobic domain of IgSF1 and the adjacent c-region were combined with the stop transfer sequence of CD47. In IgSF1Δc the c-region of IgSF1 was deleted, and in IgSF1 4xY four amino acids near the predicted SP cleavage site were mutated to tyrosines. HEK293 cells were transfected with these constructs, and processing of their protein products was monitored using a C-terminal HA tag for detection. All of the samples were deglycosylated with PNGaseF to eliminate any size differences caused by alterations in carbohydrate modifications. Using this detection system, noncleaved proteins have an apparent molecular mass of 70–80 kDa, whereas proteolytic cleavage produces C-terminal fragments of about 55 kDa (Fig. 4B). Analysis of the chimeric molecules strongly supported the idea that the internal signal sequence in IgSF1 directs site-specific protein processing. Transfer of the two hydrophobic domains and the c-region of IgSF1 into SHPS1 was sufficient to convert SHPS1 into a cleavage substrate. Whereas the first hydrophobic domain of IgSF1 could be replaced by the stop"

Here we report that in prostate cancer, the methylation of CpG islands in the δ-catenin promoter was not a primary regulatory event. There was also no δ-catenin gene amplification. However, using the single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, we observed the increased nucleotide changes in the 5′-untranslated region of δ-catenin gene in human prostate cancer. At least one such change (−9 G>A) is a true somatic point mutation associated with a high Gleason's score, poorly differentiated prostatic adenocarcinoma. Laser capture microdissection coupled with PCR analyses detected the mutation only in cancerous but not in the adjacent benign prostatic tissues. Using chimeric genes encoding the luciferase reporter, we found that this mutation, but not a random mutation or a mutation that disrupts an upstream open reading frame, resulted in a remarkably higher expression and enzyme activity. This mutation did not affect transcriptional efficiency, suggesting that it promotes δ-catenin translation. This is the first report of δ-catenin gene mutation in cancer and supports the notion that multiple mechanisms contribute to its increased expression in carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2010216470,"Rad51 protein is a well known protagonist of homologous recombination in eukaryotic cells. Rad51 polymerization on single-stranded DNA and its role in presynaptic filament formation have been extensively documented. Rad51 polymerizes also on double-stranded DNA but the significance of this filament formation remains unclear. We explored the behavior of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rad51 on dsDNA and the influence of nucleosomes on Rad51 polymerization mechanism to investigate its putative role in chromatin accessibility to recombination machinery. We combined biochemical approaches, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) for analysis of the effects of the Rad51 filament on chromatinized templates. Quantitative analyses clearly demonstrated the occurrence of chromatin remodeling during nucleoprotein filament formation. During Rad51 polymerization, recombinase proteins moved all the nucleosomal arrays in front of the progressing filament. This polymerization process had a powerful remodeling effect, as Rad51 destabilized the nucleosomes along considerable stretches of DNA. Similar behavior was observed with RecA. Thus, recombinase polymerization is a powerful mechanism of chromatin remodeling. These remarkable features open up new possibilities for understanding DNA recombination and reveal new types of ATP-dependent chromatin dynamics."

To probe the cellular TLS mechanism, a host-vector system consisting of mouse fibroblasts and a replicating plasmid bearing a single DNA adduct was developed. This system was used to explore the TLS mechanism of a heptanone-etheno-dC (H-εdC) adduct, an endogenous lesion produced by lipid peroxidation. In wild-type cells, H-εdC almost exclusively directed incorporation of dT and dA. Whereas knockout of the Y family TLS polymerase genes, Polh, Polk, or Poli, did not qualitatively affect these TLS events, inactivation of the Rev3 gene coding for a subunit of polymerase ζ or of the Rev1 gene abolished TLS associated with dA, but not dT, insertion. The analysis of results of the cellular studies and in vitro TLS studies using purified polymerases has revealed that the insertion of dA and dT was catalyzed by different polymerases in cells. While insertion of dT can be catalyzed by polymerase η, κ, and ι, insertion of dA is catalyzed by an unidentified polymerase that cannot catalyze extension from the resulting dA terminus. Therefore, the extension from this terminus requires the activity of polymerase ζ-REV1. These results provide new insight into how cells use different TLS pathways to overcome a synthesis block."

Thus, its role in tumorigenesis depends upon the function of other cellular factors. Tumor suppressor SMAR1 down-modulated in high grade breast cancers is regulated by p53 and is reported to interact and stabilize p53. Because both SMAR1 and NF-κB are involved in tumorigenesis, we investigated the effect of SMAR1 upon NF-κB activity. We show that SMAR1 induction by doxorubicin or overexpression produces functional NF-κB complexes that are competent for binding to NF-κB consensus sequence. However, SMAR1 induced p65-p50 complex is phosphorylation- and transactivation-deficient. Induction of functional NF-κB complexes stems from down-regulation of IκBα transcription through direct binding of SMAR1 to the matrix attachment region site present in IκBα promoter and recruitment of corepressor complex. Real time PCR array for NF-κB target genes revealed that SMAR1 down-regulates a subset of NF-κB target genes that are involved in tumorigenesis. We also show that SMAR1 inhibits tumor necrosis factor α-induced induction of NF-κB suggesting that activation of NF-κB by SMAR1 is independent and different from classical pathway.

The NF-κB family of transcription factors regulates a diverse range of cellular responses including cell proliferation, differentiation, programmed cell death, immune response, and tumorigenesis (1Tergaonkar V.

NF-κB transcription factor includes five subunits (p65 (Rel A), p50/p105 (NFκB1), p52/p100 (NFκB2), c-Rel, and Rel B), and its activity is controlled by inhibitor protein IκBα (3Perkins N.D.

In the nucleus, NF-κB transcription factor promotes the expression of over 150 target genes that are involved in the host immune response and in various physiological stress conditions (1Tergaonkar V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus, NF-κB/Rel regulatory proteins influence important cell fate decisions and are activated in a range of conditions involving cellular stress and injury. Based on the stimulus and the molecules involved in the NF-κB signaling module, NF-κB activation pathways are classified as canonical and non-canonical. Although the canonical pathway is induced largely by IKKβ and utilizes three canonical IκB proteins (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκB∊), the non-canonical pathway requires IKKα, which induces partial degradation of p100/Rel B to p52/Rel B (8Scheidereit C. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6685-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In addition, there are alternative pathways for NF-κB activation that involve NF-κB-inducing kinase and IKK∊ (9Hayden M.S.

However, the kinetics of NF-κB activation through the atypical pathway is relatively slower compared with canonical and non-canonical pathways. Activation of NF-κB by various stimuli including inflammatory cytokines, phorbol esters, bacterial toxins, viruses, and mitogens promotes initiation, development, and maintenance of tumors (14Baeuerle P.A.

Additionally NF-κB can promote cellular proliferation by activating Cyclin D1 promoter through Rb hyperphosphorylation (19Kim H.J. Hawke N. Baldwin A.S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 20Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of NF-κB activity is considered a potential therapy to target cancer (21Basseres D.S. Baldwin A.S. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 6817-6830Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 22Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2512) Google Scholar). Although the tumor-promoting function of NF-κB is well studied, there are reports suggesting that NF-κB activity is not always tumorigenic (23Perkins N.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7553-7556Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Perkins N.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 64-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p65 expression showed a malignant transformed phenotype (25Dajee M. Lazarov M. Zhang J.Y. Cai T. Green C.L. Russell A.J. Marinkovich M.P. Tao S. Lin Q. Kubo Y. Khavari P.A. Nature. 2003; 421: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Another report showed that inhibiting NF-κB activity leads to induction of Ras-mediated squamous cell carcinoma (26Gapuzan M.E. Yufit P.V. Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2484-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). NF-κB is also reported to induce promoter activity of tumor suppressor p53 in response to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), and p53 in turn induces the association of p52 (NF-κB2) with HDAC1 and represses Cyclin D1 transcription (27Rocha S. Martin A.M. Meek D.W. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4713-4727Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor protein ARF has also been shown to inhibit the transactivation function of NF-κB independently of p53-mdm2 function. Moreover inhibition of p65-mediated transcription by tumor suppressor ING4 in gliomas provides further evidence that NF-κB activity can be modulated by its association with various tumor suppressor proteins (28Tergaonkar V. Perkins N.D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 158-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Garkavtsev I. Kozin S.V. Chernova O. Xu L. Winkler F. Brown E. Barnett G.H. Jain R.K. Nature. 2004; 428: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the tumor-promoting functions of NF-κB can be regulated by tumor suppressor proteins. Matrix attachment region (MAR)-binding proteins organize chromatin in loop domain structure thereby partitioning chromatin from actively transcribing regions to poorly transcribing regions (30Heng H.H. Goetze S. Ye C.J. Liu G. Stevens J.B. Bremer S.W. Wykes S.M. Bode J. Krawetz S.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 999-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 31Jenuwein T. Forrester W.C. Fernandez-Herrero L.A. Laible G. Dull M. Grosschedl R. Nature. 1997; 385: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). This is brought about by their interactions with a plethora of chromatin-modifying proteins that dictate signature histone patterns governing gene transcription. As such dysregulation of various MAR-binding proteins is often seen as a major event during transition of cells to tumorigenesis, which involves chromatin rearrangements and aberrant activation of different sets of gene programs (32Bode J. Benham C. Knopp A. Mielke C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2000; 10: 73-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zink D. Fischer A.H. Nickerson J.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). SMAR1 is a MAR-binding protein, and its role in tumor suppression has been highlighted recently. SMAR1 originally identified in mouse thymocyte regulates V(D)J recombination and is known to repress Eβ-mediated transcription at the TCRβ locus via its interaction with Cux (34Chattopadhyay S. Kaul R. Charest A. Housman D. Chen J. Genomics. 2000; 68: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 35Kaul-Ghanekar R. Jalota A. Pavithra L. Tucker P. Chattopadhyay S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4862-4875Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 36Kaul-Ghanekar R. Majumdar S. Jalota A. Gulati N. Dubey N. Saha B. Chattopadhyay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9450-9459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Moreover SMAR1 interacts with HDAC1-associated repressor complex at Cyclin D1 promoter and allows histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression (37Rampalli S. Pavithra L. Bhatt A. Kundu T.K. Chattopadhyay S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8415-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). SMAR1 also inhibits tumor growth through p53 stabilization and cell cycle arrest (38He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar). Further SMAR1-derived p44 peptide has been shown to actively inhibit tumor growth in vivo (39Jalota-Badhwar A. Kaul-Ghanekar R. Mogare D. Boppana R. Paknikar K.M. Chattopadhyay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9902-9913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently we have shown that SMAR1 is up-regulated upon doxorubicin treatment in a p53-dependent manner. p53 directly binds to its response element present in SMAR1 promoter and recruits activator complex that induce SMAR1 transcription. Further we demonstrated that SMAR1 is down-regulated in advanced stages of human breast cancer, and its overexpression in breast cancer cell lines inhibits their metastatic potential through modulation of transforming growth factor β signaling (40Singh K. Mogare D. Giridharagopalan R.O. Gogiraju R. Pande G. Chattopadhyay S. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e660Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because both SMAR1 and NF-κB play important role in cancers, here we investigated their coordinated role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we report that induction of tumor suppressor protein SMAR1 by doxorubicin or overexpression induces the formation of functional NF-κB complexes through direct regulation of IκBα transcription. SMAR1 binds to the MAR present in IκBα promoter, recruits HDAC1, forms a repressor complex together with p65/p50 at the locus, and thus inhibits transcription. In contrast, SMAR1 inhibited TNFα-mediated activation of NF-κB. Real time PCR array revealed that SMAR1 represses a set of κB target genes that promote tumorigenesis. Inversely knockdown of SMAR1 by specific siRNAs resulted in direct induction of these genes, which were further induced in the presence of TNFα. Thus, we show that NF-κB activity and SMAR1 expression are directly and functionally co-related. In brief, SMAR1 modulates NF-κB transactivation and regulates the expression of NF-κB target genes through its interaction with MARs. Cell Culture, Condition, and Reagents—Breast cancer cell line MCF-7, mouse melanoma cell line B16F1, and SMAR1 stable B16F1 cells (41Kaul R. Mukherjee S. Ahmed F. Bhat M.K. Chhipa R. Galande S. Chattopadhyay S. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 103: 606-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Doxorubicin and human recombinant TNFα were obtained from Sigma. Cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106/well and treated with 0.5-2.0 μm doxorubicin for 24 h, 10 ng/ml TNFα for 2 h, and 10 nm NF-κB inhibitor (Calbiochem) for 30 min either alone or in combination. Transfections, Plasmid Constructs, and Recombinant SMAR1 Adenovirus—All transfections were done using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). SMAR1 expression plasmid pBK-CMV-SMAR1 (36Kaul-Ghanekar R.

Chem. 2005; 280: 9450-9459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and recombinant adenovirus-generated SMAR1 (38He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3251) Google Scholar) were used for overexpression studies. The 1.9-kb SMAR1 cDNA was cloned in pAdTrack-CMV vector followed by homologous recombination with pAdEasy vector in BJ5183 strain of Escherichia coli. The recombinant clones were screened for insert, linearized with PacI (New England Biolabs and transfected into HEK293 cells for packaging of virus. The virus thus produced was amplified, titrated, and further used for overexpression studies. For knockdown studies, siRNA specific for SMAR1 and control scrambled siRNA (Ambion) were used as described before (42Jalota A. Singh K. Pavithra L. Kaul-Ghanekar R. Jameel S. Chattopadhyay S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 16019-16029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For generation of the SMAR1 shRNA construct, 22-mer double-stranded oligo derived from SMAR1 mRNA sequence was cloned in RNA interference retroviral vector pSIREN-RetroQ (Clontech). IκBα Promoter Cloning—The 750-bp fragment of IκBα gene promoter was PCR-amplified and ligated to the pGMTeasy vector, subcloned in pSP73 vector (Promega) in EcoRI site, and finally cloned into pGL3 basic reporter vector (Promega) using BglII and KpnI sites. Orientation of the sense clones were checked by using HindIII site at the 5′ region of the IκBα gene promoter. Luciferase Reporter Assay—MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of pGL3-IκBα (750-bp) constructs along with 0.5 μg of pEGFP vector for internal controls. Cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection, lysed in Luclite reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Luciferase counts were measured using a TopCount luminometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Transfection efficiency was normalized to GFP counts measured using a Fluoroskan Ascent Luminometer (Lab Systems). All assays were done in triplicates. Real Time PCR—MCF-7 cells (1 × 106) transfected with pBK-CMV-SMAR1 (1.0 μg for 36 h) or treated with doxorubicin (0.5 μm for 24 h) were processed for total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Real time reverse transcription-PCR was performed by an iCycler iQ thermal cycler system (Bio-Rad) using the double-stranded DNA-specific fluorophore SYBR Green. In a 25-μl PCR, 1 μl of cDNA was amplified using SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) containing 0.4 mm deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 pmol of a forward and reverse primer mixture, SYBR Green I, and 0.5 units of iTaq DNA polymerase. PCR was done using primers specific for IκBα, SMAR1, and β-actin. Resolution of the product of interest from nonspecific product amplification was achieved by melt curve analysis. Confirmation of a single product was checked by agarose gel analysis. Quantification was performed with three different sets of cDNA samples. Graphs were plotted, and statistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot. Sequences of primers used are given in supplemental Table 1. Immunoblotting and Antibodies—Cells were scraped, washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at different time intervals, and lysed in modified DIGNAM buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mg/ml protease inhibitor). Cells were then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g, and insoluble debris were discarded. Protein concentrations were estimated using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). An equal amount of protein was loaded for immunoblotting. Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, resolved proteins were electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and 5% bovine serum albumin. The membrane was then probed with primary antibody in TBST for 2 h followed by three 10-min TBST washes at room temperature. Incubation with the secondary antibody was done for 1 h, and three 10-min TBST washes were done prior to detection. Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies for p50, IκBα, β-actin, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. p65 NF-κB and phosphoserine 536 p65 NF-κB were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit polyclonal SMAR1 antibody was raised in house. For this GST-SMAR1 (400-548 amino acids) conjugated with appropriate adjuvant was injected in the rabbit. Following three booster doses, the antibody titer was checked, and the ascitic fluid was further purified using recombinant protein A beads (Sigma). Confocal Microscopy—B16F1 or MCF-7 cells were plated at 2 × 105/ml on coverslips in 35-mm culture dishes. After 24 h, MCF-7 cells were transfected with 1.0 μg of pEGFPC3-SMAR1 plasmid. Coverslips were removed after 48 h and processed for confocal microscopy. Cells were fixed with 2.0% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and blocked in 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 1 h. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) secondary antibodies were used at a 1:200 and 1:400 dilutions, respectively. When indicated, specimens were analyzed with a confocal laser microscope (LSM 510, version 2.01; Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Image analysis and quantification of immunostaining was done using LSM 510 version 2.01 software (Ziess). For quantification at least 50 cells were observed from five different fields, and the mean fluorescence intensity was measured. Statistical analysis was done using SigmaPlot. Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—For SMAR1 protein purification, GST-SMAR1 clones were grown in Luria-Bertani medium with ampicillin and induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing PBS, Triton X-100, 1% Sarkosyl (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After sonication, the supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. After three washes, each with lysis buffer and PBS, the protein was eluted with 100 mm reduced glutathione buffer. The eluted fraction was resolved on gels, and protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—The 200-bp fragment of IκBα promoter spanning the putative MAR was amplified using primer 401F-610R and was used as Probe I. Another region of 260 bp (non-MAR) was amplified using primer 881F-1141R and was used as negative control. A 50-mer MAR oligo (Probe II), mutant IκBα MAR oligos (Probe III, Probe IV, and Probe V), NF-κB consensus oligo, and NF-κB mutant oligo were chemically synthesized (Genomechanix). All the primers and oligo sequences used in PCR are provided in supplemental Table 1. Nuclear lysate were prepared using modified DIGNAM buffer as described in Ref. 34Chattopadhyay S. Kaul R. Charest A. Housman D. Chen J. Genomics. 2000; 68: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Oligonucleotide labeling was done by a Klenow reaction using [α-32P]dCTP in a 20-μl reaction containing 1 mm dNTP mixture, Klenow buffer, and 0.5 units of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs). Probe purification was done using a Probequant G-50 column (Amersham Biosciences). Nuclear lysates (5-10 μg) were incubated with respective probes in a 10-μl total volume containing binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 1 μg poly(dI-dC), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin) for 10 min at room temperature. Similar binding reactions were also performed using 125, 250, and 500 ng of GST and GST-SMAR1 recombinant proteins in binding buffer (as described above) for 15 min at room temperature. Binding complexes and free probe were resolved by 8% native PAGE and processed for autoradiography. Sequences of oligos used for EMSA studies are given in supplemental Table 2. Immunoprecipitation—pBK-CMV-SMAR1-transfected or doxorubicin-treated nuclear lysates (200 μg) of MCF-7 cells were immunoprecipitated with rabbit α-SMAR1 and probed for p65 and p50. Two hundred micrograms of protein was diluted in 1× PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were precleared with control immunoglobulin G (IgG) and 20 μl of protein A/G beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were incubated with specific antibody for 12 h and immobilized on protein A/G beads. Beads were washed thrice with 1× PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and eluted in 20 μl of sample buffer. Endogenous proteins were detected by Western blot analysis. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed using a ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) following the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated chromatin was immunoprecipitated using respective antibodies as mentioned in the figures. Input DNA, rabbit IgG-, and mouse IgG-pulled DNA served as controls for all the experiments. Immunoprecipitated DNA was then subjected to 25 cycles of PCR using primers for respective promoter regions as mentioned in the figures. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter was used as a nonspecific control for all the ChIP experiments. All primer sequences are given in supplemental Table 1. Real Time PCR Array for κB Target Genes—MCF-7 cells (5 × 106) transduced with recombinant SMAR1 adenovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1:100 or treated with 100 nm SMAR1-specific siRNA for 48 h with or without TNFα treatment (10 ng/ml for 2 h) were harvested and subjected to cDNA synthesis following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Real time PCR array for NF-κB target genes were obtained from Superarray, and array PCR was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Increased NF-κB Expression and DNA Binding upon SMAR1 Overexpression—NF-κB is activated by a plethora of stimuli including various chemotherapeutic drugs, and it in turn activates transcription of its target genes (1Tergaonkar V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Tumor suppressor SMAR1 is down-regulated in breast cancer and is induced by doxorubicin (40Singh K. Mogare D. Giridharagopalan R.O. Gogiraju R. Pande G. Chattopadhyay S. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e660Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because NF-κB is also activated by doxorubicin (1Tergaonkar V. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2006; 38: 1647-1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), we investigated whether SMAR1 has any correlation with NF-κB activity. For this, MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with SMAR1. Immunoblot analysis revealed increased expression of p65 and p50 subunits of NF-κB with increasing doses of SMAR1 (Fig. 1A). Because in unstimulated normal cells NF-κB subunits are localized in cytoplasm in an inactive form bound to a member of the IκB protein family, we checked the levels of p65 and p50 subunits in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions upon SMAR1 overexpression. Both p65 and p50 subunits were increased in the nuclear fraction of SMAR1-overexpressing MCF-7 cells, whereas the levels in the cytoplasm remained unchanged (Fig. 1B). Also doxorubicin treatment in MCF-7 cells showed increased expression of p65 as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1C). Upon stimulation by various growth factors, cytokines, mitogens, or DNA damage, the p65/p50 subunits rapidly translocate to the nucleus to regulate κB target genes through DNA binding. As activation of NF-κB subunits results in regulation of different target genes through differences in DNA binding affinity, we investigated the DNA binding of SMAR1-induced NF-κB complexes. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay using nuclear lysate from SMAR1-overexpressing cells showed increased DNA binding of p65/p50 heterodimer to the NF-κB consensus sequence (22-mer oligo) (Fig. 1D). An oligo with a mutant NF-κB binding site failed to form a complex confirming the specificity of the complex obtained (Fig. 1E). Further we performed immunofluorescence studies in MCF-7 cell transfected with pEGFPC3 vector and pEGFP-SMAR1. Although overexpression of GFP (green) vector did show any nuclear translocation of p65 that was exclusively localized in the cytosol (Fig. 2A, upper panel), overexpression of GFP-SMAR1 (green) resulted in a drastic nuclear translocation as visible by p65 staining (red) (Fig. 2A, lower panel). We also observed that p50 was found mostly in the cytosol in GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 2B, upper panel) and translocated into the nucleus of GFP-SMAR1-transfected cells (Fig. 2B, lower panel). Thus, SMAR1 induces the expression, nuclear accumulation, and DNA binding of p65/p50 subunits to its cognate sequence.FIGURE 2SMAR1 induces nuclear translocation of p65 and p50. MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with GFP and GFP-SMAR1 expression plasmids and immunostained for nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of p65 (A) and p50 (B). p65 is stained with red (Cy3), SMAR1 is seen as GFP fluorescence (green), and nuclei are stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (blue).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SMAR1 Down-regulates IκBα Expression—Nuclear translocation of NF-κB is tightly regulated by IκBα that is transcriptionally controlled by NF-κB (7Zandi E.

https://openalex.org/W2052856178,"The actin cytoskeleton is a primary determinant of tumor cell motility and metastatic potential. Motility and metastasis are thought to be regulated, in large part, by the interaction of membrane proteins with cytoplasmic linker proteins and of these linker proteins, in turn, with actin. However, complete membrane-to-actin linkages have been difficult to identify. We used co-immunoprecipitation and competitive peptide assays to show that intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM-2)/alpha-actinin/actin may comprise such a linkage in neuroblastoma cells. ICAM-2 expression limited the motility of these cells and redistributed actin fibers in vitro, and suppressed development of disseminated tumors in an in vivo model of metastatic neuroblastoma. Consistent with these observations, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated ICAM-2 expression in primary neuroblastoma tumors exhibiting features that are associated with limited metastatic disease and more favorable clinical outcome. In neuroblastoma cell lines, ICAM-2 expression did not affect AKT activation, tumorigenic potential or chemosensitivity, as has been reported for some types of transfected cells. The observed ICAM-2-mediated suppression of metastatic phenotype is a novel function for this protein, and the interaction of ICAM-2/alpha-actinin/actin represents the first complete membrane-linker protein-actin linkage to impact tumor cell motility in vitro and metastatic potential in an in vivo model. Current work focuses on identifying specific protein domains critical to the regulation of neuroblastoma cell motility and metastasis and on determining if these domains represent exploitable therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2075815627,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection frequently causes neurologic disease even with anti-retroviral treatment. Although associations between MHC class I alleles and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been reported, the role MHC class I alleles play in restricting development of HIV-induced organ-specific diseases, including neurologic disease, has not been characterized. This study examined the relationship between expression of the MHC class I allele Mane-A*10 and development of lentiviral-induced central nervous system (CNS) disease using a well-characterized simian immunodeficiency (SIV)/pigtailed macaque model. The risk of developing CNS disease (SIV encephalitis) was 2.5 times higher for animals that did not express the MHC class I allele Mane-A*10 (P = 0.002; RR = 2.5). Animals expressing the Mane-A*10 allele had significantly lower amounts of activated macrophages, SIV RNA, and neuronal dysfunction in the CNS than Mane-A*10 negative animals (P<0.001). Mane-A*10 positive animals with the highest CNS viral burdens contained SIV gag escape mutants at the Mane-A*10-restricted KP9 epitope in the CNS whereas wild type KP9 sequences dominated in the brain of Mane-A*10 negative animals with comparable CNS viral burdens. These concordant findings demonstrate that particular MHC class I alleles play major neuroprotective roles in lentiviral-induced CNS disease."
https://openalex.org/W2048822771,"Homology modeling and scanning cysteine mutagenesis studies suggest that the human glucose transport protein GLUT1 and its distant bacterial homologs LacY and GlpT share similar structures. We tested this hypothesis by mapping the accessibility of purified, reconstituted human erythrocyte GLUT1 to aqueous probes. GLUT1 contains 35 potential tryptic cleavage sites. Fourteen of 16 lysine residues and 18 of 19 arginine residues were accessible to trypsin. GLUT1 lysine residues were modified by isothiocyanates and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters in a substrate-dependent manner. Twelve lysine residues were accessible to sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin. GLUT1 trypsinization released full-length transmembrane helix 1, cytoplasmic loop 6–7, and the long cytoplasmic C terminus from membranes. Trypsin-digested GLUT1 retained cytochalasin B and d-glucose binding capacity and released full-length transmembrane helix 8 upon cytochalasin B (but not d-glucose) binding. Transmembrane helix 8 release did not abrogate cytochalasin B binding. GLUT1 was extensively proteolyzed by α-chymotrypsin, which cuts putative pore-forming amphipathic α-helices 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 11 at multiple sites to release transmembrane peptide fragments into the aqueous solvent. Putative scaffolding membrane helices 3, 6, 9, and 12 are strongly hydrophobic, resistant to α-chymotrypsin, and retained by the membrane bilayer. These observations provide experimental support for the proposed GLUT1 architecture; indicate that the proposed topology of membrane helices 5, 6, and 12 requires adjustment; and suggest that the metastable conformations of transmembrane helices 1 and 8 within the GLUT1 scaffold destabilize a sugar translocation intermediate.

However, the detailed three-dimensional structure of GLUT1 is not known, and GLUT1 conformational changes catalyzing transport are unclear. The structures of bacterial MFS transport proteins offer new insights into carrier structure (12Dahl S.G. Sylte I. Ravna A.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Although mammalian MFS proteins, such as GLUT1, can be refractory to three-dimensional crystallization (12Dahl S.G. Sylte I. Ravna A.W. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

This discrepancy is consistent with a recent demonstration that homology modeling approximates carrier topology and architecture but is less successful at defining the spatial arrangement of specific residues (22Lemieux M.J. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2007; 24: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Deviations between experimental and modeled structures may also reflect structural and functional differences between template and target proteins. The proposed GLUT1 architecture is inherently accessible to experimental evaluation. GLUT1 contains 16 lysine and 20 arginine residues (5Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar) located within proposed intra- and extracellular loops, within the N and C termini, and at the membrane/solvent interface. Water-exposed lysine residues should be accessible to primary amine-reactive, polar covalent probes. Water-exposed lysine and arginine residues may also be accessible to trypsin. This study examined the accessibility of membrane-resident GLUT1 to proteases and to primary amine-reactive covalent probes. To maximize in vivo relevance, we specifically studied human erythrocyte GLUT1 purified under conditions where native function and quaternary structure are preserved (23Graybill C. van Hoek A.N. Desai D. Carruthers A.M. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8096-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our findings provide direct experimental support for the proposed GLUT1 architecture, suggest that the topology of some membrane helices requires minor adjustment, and illustrate that transmembrane helix 8 undergoes significant conformational change upon GLUT1 ligand binding.

Phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween comprised 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 3.4 mm KCl, 1.84 mm KH2PO4, and 0.1% Tween, pH 7.3. Human Erythrocyte Membranes and Glucose Transport Protein—Glucose transporter and endogenous lipids were purified from human erythrocyte membranes in the absence of reductant as described previously (24Hebert D.N.

The resulting unsealed GLUT1 proteoliposomes (26Sultzman L.A. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6640-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) contain 90% GLUT1, 8% RhD protein, and 2% nucleoside transporter (by protein mass) and contain equal masses of lipid and protein (27Zottola R.J. Cloherty E.K. Coderre P.E. Hansen A. Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9734-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Cytochalasin B Binding—[3H]cytochalasin B (CB) binding to GLUT1 proteoliposomes was measured as described previously (23Graybill C. van Hoek A.N. Desai D. Carruthers A.M. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8096-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GLUT1 Deglycosylation—GLUT1 (50 μgin50 μl of kaline buffer) was incubated with 1,500 activity units of peptide-N-glycosidase F for 1 h at 37 °C. Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—GLUT1 protein was resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis used C-Ab at 1:10,000 dilution as described previously (27Zottola R.J. Cloherty E.K. Coderre P.E. Hansen A. Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9734-9747Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). GLUT1 Covalent Modification—GLUT1 (25–100 μg) was incubated with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (10 mm; pH 7.4, 4 °C), with fluorescein isothiocyanate (500 μm; pH 8, 4 °C), or with [14C]phenylisothiocyanate (50 μm; pH 8.0, 4 °C) at GLUT1:covalent probe molar ratios ranging from 1:0.2 to 1:2,000 for 1 min to 1,800 min (29Blodgett D.M. De Zutter J.K. Levine K.B. Karim P. Carruthers A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Reactions were quenched with 50 mm Tris-HCl or glycine, and membranes were sedimented, washed several times with additional quench solution, and resuspended in medium appropriate for follow-up analysis. ELISA—Biotin incorporation was quantitated by ELISA. Wells were precoated with C-Ab (200 μl of a 1:5,000 dilution; 300 min at 37 °C) and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (120 min at 37 °C). Biotinylated GLUT1 was solubilized (2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 60 min at 4 °C), clarified by centrifugation (≈200,000 × g for 15 min), and applied to triplicate wells (200 μl/well, 2-h incubation at 4 °C). Wells were washed and blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 2% Triton X-100. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added (1 μg/ml; 1 h at 20 °C), and following washing, product development was measured as absorbance at 415 nm using a Benchmark Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad). Tryptic and α-Chymotryptic Digested GLUT1 Peptides—Unmodified or pretreated reconstituted GLUT1 in kaline (0.5 mg/ml, 55-μl total reaction volume) was digested with trypsin or α-chymotrypsin at a 1:10 ratio (enzyme:GLUT1 by mass) for 0–2 h at 30 °C. Peptides were subjected to HPLC-ESI-MS/MS immediately or were processed further. Digests were separated into aqueous and membrane fractions by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C in a Beckman air-driven ultracentrifuge (≈200,000 × g). HPLC Separation of GLUT1 Peptides—Peptides (25 μg of GLUT1 in 50 μl of kaline) were resolved by reverse phase chromatography (30Weinglass A. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41858-41865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using a polystyrene divinylbenzene copolymer column (5 μm, 300 Å, 150 × 2.1 mm; PLRP-S, Polymer Laboratories, Amherst, MA)) at 40 °C. Peptides were eluted using one of two gradients comprising solvent A (5% 1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile:isopropanol in water) and solvent B (1:1 (v/v) acetonitrile:isopropanol). Both solvents contained 0.1% formic acid and 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid (30Weinglass A. Whitelegge J.P. Faull K.F. Kaback H.R. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 2004; 136: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Supernatant fractions were resolved using 15-min equilibration in 98% solvent A and 2% solvent B followed by raising the percentage of solvent B to 10% over 3 min, to 45% over 37 min, and to 95% over 2 min where it was held for 10 min prior to re-equilibration. The flow rate was 200 μl/min. Resolution of membrane fraction peptides required longer exposure to organic solvents: after 15 min of exposure to 95% solvent A and 5% solvent B, the percentage of solvent B was raised to 20% over 4 min and then to 95% over 56 min where it was held for 10 min prior to re-equilibration. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—ESI-MS analysis was performed using a Thermo Fisher LCQ or an LTQ electrospray ionization mass spectrometer. Operational parameters included positive ion mode; spray voltage, 4.5 kV; capillary temperature, 225 °C; and scan range, m/z 400–2,000. MS/MS fragments of isolated peptide species were produced in the ion trap by collision-induced dissociation with helium gas at 35 V. Acquisition methods were created using Xcalibur (version 1.2). MS/MS spectra were identified using the Bioworks Sequest version 3.2 data base search program and the human red blood cell proteome data base compiled by Kakhniashvili et al. (32Kakhniashvili D.G. Bulla L.A. J. Goodman S.R. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2004; 3: 501-509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Experimental System—All experiments used GLUT1 proteoliposomes comprising purified GLUT1 and co-purified, native erythrocyte lipids. These proteoliposomes are unsealed and simultaneously expose endo- and exofacial GLUT1 domains to exogenous ligands, proteolytic enzymes, and antibodies (26Sultzman L.A. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6640-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Appleman J.R. Lienhard G.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8221-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All analyses were performed using untreated GLUT1 or GLUT1 exposed to trypsin or α-chymotrypsin for 2 h at 30 °C by which time proteolysis is complete as judged by SDS-PAGE or immunoblot analysis (29Blodgett D.M. De Zutter J.K. Levine K.B. Karim P. Carruthers A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 130: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). GLUT1 residues comprising individual TM α-helices, intra- and extracellular loops, and the N and C termini were assigned according to the homology model of Salas-Burgos et al. (11Salas-Burgos A. Iserovich P. Zuniga F. Vera J.C. Fischbarg J. Biophys. J. 2004; 87: 2990-2999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) in which TMs are organized by location and function: those forming the aqueous translocation pathway (group 1 (TMs 1, 4, 7, and 10) and group 2 (TMs 2, 5, 8, and 11)) or those comprising the lipid bilayer-embedded scaffolding region (group 3 (TMs 3, 6, 9, and 12); Fig. 1B (13Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar, 14Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar)). Loops describe the TMs they connect. For example, L1–2 is the exofacial loop connecting TMs 1 and 2. GLUT1 Accessibility to Proteolytic Enzymes—GLUT1 contains 35 potential tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin proteolytic sites (16 lysine and 19 arginine residues (5Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar)). These residues are located within proposed intra- and extracellular loops, within the N and C termini, and at the membrane/solvent interface. Our results show that 32 sites were detected by MS/MS analysis of trypsin-treated GLUT1 (Fig. 2A). Only residues Arg153 and Lys183 flanking TM5 and Lys451 at the C-terminal end of TM12 appear to be inaccessible to trypsin digestion. α-Chymotrypsin is less specific and in our hands consistently cleaved GLUT1 at the C-terminal end of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, leucine, alanine, methionine, and glutamic acid. These residues are located both in putative, water-exposed domains and in membrane-embedded protein domains. Each putative TM contains at least five potential α-chymotrypsin cleavage sites, but we observed TM-specific proteolysis (Fig. 2B). Although groups 1 and 2 TM α-chymotrypsin cleavage products were detected, group 3 TM proteolysis was not detected (Table 1 and Fig. 3A). The number of detected cleavage sites declined in the following order: group 1 (15 sites) > group 2 (10 sites) >> group 3 TMs (one site; see Table 1). Putative, extramembranous regions revealed more proteolytic products than membrane-embedded domains, and the longest contiguous regions of the protein (N and C termini, L1–2, and L6–7) produced twice as many cleavage products than shorter loops.TABLE 1Susceptibility of GLUT1 side chains to proteolytic attackGrouping and regionaRegions are delineated as 1) individual, membrane-embedded α-helices; 2) membrane-spanning helix groups; 3) loop, tail, and regions not embedded within the membrane; 4) summation of the individual membrane-embedded α-helices versus all other regions; and 5) the proteolytic susceptibility of the entire transport structurePotential sitesbThe potential number of cleavage sitesSites cleavedcThe number of sites detected as cleavage sitesCleavage ratedThe percent accessibility of the region to proteolysisSSReThe relative hydrophobicity of each region was calculated using the sequence specific retention (SSR) calculator developed by the Manitoba Center for Proteomics (42).

Residues Arg153 and Lys183 flanking TM5 were detected as tryptic cleavage sites in SDS-PAGE gel-eluted GLUT1. CD analysis demonstrated that gel-eluted GLUT1 contains significant α-helical structure, which may explain the persistent protease resistance of strongly hydrophobic TMs in the presence of SDS. GLUT1 Peptide Water Solubility—GLUT1 proteolytic digests may be separated into membrane and aqueous fractions by centrifugation. Trypsin digestion released GLUT1 N and C termini, a portion of L1–2, and all of L6–7 into the aqueous buffer. The L1–2 peptide was detected only following GLUT1 deglycosylation by peptide-N-glycosidase F. Full-length TM1, cleaved at intracellular Arg11 and outer bilayer-hemileaflet Lys38, was also detected in the aqueous fraction (Fig. 4A). α-Chymotrypsin digestion released a similar pattern of GLUT1 extramembranous regions into the aqueous fraction including the N and C termini, a portion of L7–8, and all of L1–2, L6–7, and L10–11. The isolated aqueous fraction also contained TM1 in its entirety as well as portions of TMs 2, 4, 7, 8, 10, and 11 (Fig. 4B). TM8 (residues Ala301 through Arg330) was released into the buffer when trypsin digestion was carried out in the presence of the transport inhibitor CB (10 μm; Figs. 4A and 5) or when the membrane fraction of a CB-free trypsin digest was resuspended in buffer containing CB. Cytochalasin D, DMSO, d-glucose, and maltose were unable to displace TM8 from trypsin-digested membranes. Dot-blots of α-chymotrypsin-digested GLUT1 using peptide-directed antibodies confirmed that GLUT1 N and C termini and loop 7–8 peptides were released by chymotrypsin but that loop 8–9 peptides (residues 325–338) were released only when CB was present during proteolysis. Ligand Binding to Proteolyzed GLUT1—Trypsinization increased the CB binding capacity of GLUT1 (Table 2), increased Kd(app) for CB binding, and decreased Ki(app) for d-glucose inhibition of CB binding. Displacement of TM8 by trypsinization in the presence of 10 μm CB was without additional impact on CB or d-glucose binding. CB binding to α-chymotrypsin-treated GLUT1 was undetectable (Table 2).TABLE 2Ligand binding to GLUT1Experimenta[3H]Cytochalasin B binding to GLUT1 proteoliposomes. CB binding was measured using GLUT1 proteoliposomes in saline buffer (control); GLUT1 proteoliposomes were incubated with trypsin to remove fragments L1, L2, L6, N and C termini, and TM1 (trypsin); GLUT1 was trypsinized in the presence of 10 μm CB to additionally remove TM8 (post-trypsin/CB); and GLUT1 proteoliposomes were treated with α-chymotrypsin.

https://openalex.org/W2050232583,"Brain tumors are associated with genetic alterations of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells leads to oxidative stress-induced damage, resulting in tumorigenesis. Here, we showed that the nuclear matrix protein nuclear restricted protein in brain (NRP/B) was colocalized and interacted with NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). During oxidative stress response, NRP/B expression and its interaction with Nrf2 were upregulated in SH-SY5Y cells. Association of NRP/B with Nrf2 was crucial for NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) expression. NRP/B was localized predominantly in the nucleus of normal brain cells, whereas in primary brain tumors NRP/B was almost exclusively contained in the cytoplasm. In addition, unlike wild-type NRP/B, the expression of NRP/B mutants isolated from primary brain tumors was found in the cytoplasm, and these mutants failed to induce Nrf2-dependent NQO1 transcription. Thus, NRP/B mutations and their altered localization resulted in changes in NRP/B function and deregulation of Nrf2-dependent NQO1 activation in brain tumors. This study provides insights into the mechanism by which the NRP/B modulates Nrf2-dependent NQO1 induction in cellular protection against ROS in brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1966481568,"Δ3(E)-Unsaturated fatty acids are characteristic components of glycosylceramides from some fungi, including also human- and plant-pathogenic species. The function and genetic basis for this unsaturation is unknown. For Fusarium graminearum, which is pathogenic to grasses and cereals, we could show that the level of Δ3-unsaturation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) was highest at low temperatures and decreased when the fungus was grown above 28 °C. With a bioinformatics approach, we identified a new family of polypeptides carrying the histidine box motifs characteristic for membrane-bound desaturases. One of the corresponding genes was functionally characterized as a sphingolipid-Δ3(E)-desaturase. Deletion of the candidate gene in F. graminearum resulted in loss of the Δ3(E)-double bond in the fatty acyl moiety of GlcCer. Heterologous expression of the corresponding cDNA from F. graminearum in the yeast Pichia pastoris led to the formation of Δ3(E)-unsaturated GlcCer.

Glycosphingolipids represent a structurally and functionally diverse group of membrane lipids ubiquitously distributed among all eukaryotes.

Fungal GlcCer mainly consists of a diunsaturated, C9-methyl-branched sphingoid base, (4E, 8E)-9-methyl-sphinga-4,8-dienine, which is N-acylated with an α-hydroxylated fatty acid. The fatty acyl moiety can be further modified by the introduction of a Δ3(E)-double bond (Fig. 1), whose function is still unclear. glucosylceramide galactosylceramide electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry gas liquid chromatography gas chromatography-mass spectrometry fatty acid methyl ester trimethylsilylated FAMEs phosphatidylglycerol Δ3(E)-desaturase candidate from F. graminearum complete minimal medium antifungal peptide stearic acid oleic acid α-linolenic acid 2-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid 2-hydroxyoctadecenoic acid The occurrence of the Δ3(E)-double bond is restricted to euascomycete fungi, including human- and plant-pathogenic species (reviewed in Ref. 5Warnecke D. Heinz E. CMLS Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 919-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Depending on the organism, the proportion of Δ3(E)-unsaturated sphingolipids varies. In the two dimorphic fungi Histoplasma capsulatum and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, the GlcCer of the mycelial form shows a higher proportion of unsaturation than the GlcCer of the yeast form. In galactosylceramides (GalCer) of Aspergillus fumigatus (a fungus without a yeast form), the proportion of Δ3(E)-unsaturated fatty acids is higher than in GlcCer, and in Sporothrix schenckii, the double bond is restricted to GalCer of the yeast form (6Toledo M.S.

These data suggest that the Δ3(E)-desaturation might be important for the yeast-mycelium phase transition of dimorphic fungi, although it depends on the fungus whether the proportion of Δ3(E)-unsaturated fatty acids is higher in the yeast form or in the mycelium. 3(E)-Double bonds are also found in other lipid molecules. Phosphatidylglycerol in photosynthetically active plastids carries mostly Δ3(E)-hexadecenoic acid in the sn-2 position (Fig. 1). The gene locus for the putative desaturase was named fad4, but the actual sequence is still not known (reviewed in Ref. 9Ohlrogge J. Browse J. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 957-970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Δ3(E)-unsaturation can also be found in common polyunsaturated C18-fatty acids of seed triacylglycerols in some higher plants. One example is caleic acid, (3E,9Z,12Z)-octadeca-3,9,12-trienoic acid (Fig. 1), representing a major fatty acid in triacylglycerols from seeds of Stenachaenum macrocephalum and Calea urticaefolia (10Bagby M.O.

All sphingolipid modifying desaturases and hydroxylases belong to a large superfamily of membrane-bound enzymes. Therefore, we expected that the Δ3-desaturase would also belong to this group. Members of this superfamily contain three characteristic sequence motifs, the histidine boxes HX3-4H, HX2-3HH, and (H/Q)X2-3HH (22Shanklin J. Whittle E. Fox B.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Some of these sequences are fused to a cytochrome b5 domain. We expected that the fatty acid α-hydroxylase Scs7p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae would show the highest sequence similarity to the Δ3(E)-desaturase because it represents the enzyme with the closest similarity regarding regioselectivity. Here we describe the identification, cloning, and functional characterization of a sphingolipid-Δ3(E)-desaturase from the plant-pathogenic euascomycete Fusarium graminearum. This monomorphic fungus grows only in the mycelial form and contains GlcCer but no GalCer (23Ramamoorthy V. Cahoon E.B. Li J. Thokala M. Minto R.E. Shah D.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We used phylogenetic profiling to identify a candidate gene, which was cloned and subjected to deletion and expression studies. Bioinformatics—The NCBI non-redundant protein sequence data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) was searched using PSI-BLAST (24Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) with the α-hydroxylase Scs7p from S. cerevisiae and the fatty acid Δ11-desaturase from Thalassiosira pseudonana (25Tonon T. Harvey D. Qing R. Li Y. Larson T.R. Graham I.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as queries. The resulting sequences were checked for the presence of histidine box motifs and analyzed as described in Refs. 20Ternes P. Franke S. Zähringer U. Sperling P. Heinz E. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar). With this strategy, 10 desaturase-like sequences were found in the completely sequenced genome of F. graminearum. A putative function could clearly be assigned to 9 of the 10 desaturase sequences by phylogenetic classification within the superfamily of membrane-bound desaturases. The remaining desaturase-like sequence not clustering with desaturases of known regioselectivity was chosen as a query gene for the subsequent BLAST searches of other eukaryotic genomes. Further phylogenetic profiling resulted in promising orthologous candidates forming a single desaturase family restricted to euascomycetes such as F. graminearum (Fg05382, Acc-Nr. XP_383758), Magnaporthe grisea (XP_368852), A. fumigatus (XP_748510), Aspergillus nidulans (XP_662689 and XP_658567), and Neurospora crassa (XP_958382). Growth of Pichia pastoris—A preculture was grown in YPD medium (2% bacto tryptone, 1% yeast extract, 1% d-glucose) for 24 h at 30 °C with shaking (180 rpm). 200 ml of fresh YPD medium were inoculated 1:100 from the preculture and incubated again for 24 h at 30 °C. Gene expression was induced by replacing YPD with minimal methanol medium (1.3% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.5% methanol) and further incubation for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. Growth of F. graminearum—For induction of conidiation, mycelium of F. graminearum strain 8/1 (27Miedaner T. Reinbrecht C. Schilling A.G. J. Plant Dis. Prot. 2000; 107: 124-134Google Scholar) was grown on agar plates at 18 °C under near UV light and white light with a 12-h photoperiod for ∼10 days (28Nirenberg H.I. Can. J. Bot. 1981; 59: 1599-1609Crossref Google Scholar). For transformation and/or lipid analysis, F. graminearum was grown in complete minimal medium (CM (29Leach J. Lang B.R. Yoder O.C. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1982; 128: 1719-1729Google Scholar)) for 2-3 days with shaking (150 rpm) and a standard temperature of 28 °C. To determine the temperature-dependent occurrence of the Δ3(E)-double bond in GlcCer, equal amounts of conidia were grown in 100 ml of CM at 18, 28, and 30 °C, respectively, for 3 and 7 days. Construction of a Disruption Vector for F. graminearum—5′- and 3′-flanking regions of Fg05382 were amplified by a standard PCR program using Pwo-polymerase (peqlab) and the specific primers 5′-agagctcgagCCTAAAGCGACCTACACATATGA-3′ and 5′-atctagatctTGTTAATTTGATGTCGCACATGAGA-3′ (5′-flanking region, 722-bp fragment) and 5′-agagagatctCACGATATCGATTACTTCATGATC-3′ and 5′-agaggcggccgcTCACCATGGCAGTTCAAGCTTAT-3′ (3′-flanking region, 964-bp fragment). All primers provided recognition sites for the restriction enzymes BglII, NotI, or XhoI (underlined). The amplified sequences were cloned into the vector pGEM®-T (Promega). As a selection marker, a hygromycin-resistance cassette (hph, previously cloned into pGEM®-T, with BglII restriction sites at either end) was cloned into the BglII site between the 5′- and 3′-flanking regions, resulting in the construction of pΔ3FgKO. For transformation of F. graminearum, the construct was linearized with XhoI and NotI (all restriction enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs). Cloning of the Putative Δ3(E)-Desaturases—cDNA from F. graminearum strain 8/1 was used as template for amplification of the complete open reading frame using a proofreading Pwo-polymerase (peqlab) and a standard PCR program. The specific primer sequences with restriction sites for EcoRI (forward) or NotI (reverse) were: 5′-atctgaattcattATGGCCGAACACCTCGTCT-3′ and 5′-atctgcggccgcCTACTGCCTCTTAAACTTCTT-3′. The resulting PCR product was ligated into the vector pGEM®-T, and its identity was confirmed by sequencing. The isolated fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites of the Pichia expression vector pPIC3.5 (Invitrogen), resulting in the plasmid pd3Fg-PIC, which was linearized prior to transformation of P. pastoris with BglII. Transformation of F. graminearum—Protoplasting and chemical transformation of F. graminearum were carried out as described in Ref. 30Maier F.J. Malz S. Lösch A.P. Lacour T. Schäfer W. FEMS Yeast Res. 2005; 5: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar with modifications. 50 ml of CM were inoculated with 30,000 conidia and incubated for 24 h at 28 °C with shaking (150 rpm). Mycelium was homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax blender, and the volume of CM was increased to 200 ml and incubated overnight at 28 °C. The collected mycelium was washed twice with sterile water and dried on sterile Whatman paper. 1 g of mycelium was suspended in 20 ml of an enzyme mix (3% Glucanex™, 5% driselase, both from Sigma-Aldrich, dissolved in 700 mm NaCl, pH 5.6) and digested for 3 h at 28 °C with shaking at 75 rpm. Protoplasts were separated from undigested hyphal material by filtration through gauze and nylon membrane (first filtration, 100-μm pore size; second filtration, 40-μm pore size). The protoplasts were sedimented (5 min, 850 × g), washed twice with ice-cold 700 mm NaCl-solution, and subsequently resuspended in 1 ml of STC (1.2 m sorbitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm CaCl2) and stored on ice until transformation. For transformation, 1 × 107 protoplasts were diluted in STC to a final volume of 1 ml. 30 μg of the linearized knock-out-cassette were added, and the protoplasts were incubated on ice for 10 min. 1 ml of PTC (60% polyethylene glycol 3350, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 50 mm CaCl2) was added followed by incubation for 20 min on ice. The protoplast suspension was mixed gently with 8 ml of STC and plated in aliquots of 750 μl on regeneration medium (0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% bacto tryptone, 1 m sucrose, 1.6% granulated agar; 10 ml poured in 94-mm Petri dishes). After incubation for 12-24 h at 28 °C, the plates were overlaid with 10 ml of selective agar (1.2% granulated agar in water, 200 μgml-1 hygromycin B) and further incubated. Transformants were obtained about 7 days after transformation. They were transferred to fresh CM plates containing 100 μgml-1 hygromycin B and incubated at 28 °C. Single transformants were isolated and checked for the correct integration of the knock-out cassette by PCR and southern-blotting. Transformation of P. pastoris—The expression construct pd3Fg-PIC was linearized with BglII. Electrocompetent cells of P. pastoris strain GS115 were generated, and transformation by electroporation was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Single colonies were checked by PCR for the correct integration of the construct and used for lipid analyses. Isolation of Glucosylceramide—Approximately 2-3 g of fresh weight of P. pastoris cells or mycelium of F. graminearum were suspended in 5 ml of H2O and boiled in a water bath for 15 min. The cells were sedimented by centrifugation, and the lipids were extracted by shaking in 10 ml of chloroform/methanol 1:1 overnight at 8 °C followed by 9 ml of chloroform/methanol 2:1 for at least 4 h at 8 °C. To increase the yield of F. graminearum lipids, the mycelium was homogenized with an Ultra-Turrax blender during the first extraction step. The lipid extract was washed by phase partitioning with chloroform/methanol/0.45% NaCl (8:4:3), the organic phase was collected, and the solvents were subsequently evaporated. The lipids in the residue were redissolved in chloroform, and glucosylceramide was purified by preparative TLC on silica gel 60 plates (Merck), developed in chloroform/methanol 85:15. For NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, the purified GlcCer was peracetylated (with acetic anhydride in pyridine 1:1) overnight at room temperature and repurified by TLC in diethyl ether. Analysis of Fatty Acids—Fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were obtained from GlcCer by incubation with sulfuric acid (2 n in methanol with 2% 2,2-dimethoxy propane) overnight at 80 °C and extracted with petrol ether. Because fungal GlcCers mostly contain α-hydroxylated fatty acids, the FAMEs were converted to their trimethylsilyl derivatives. For this purpose, purified FAMEs were dissolved in 100 μl of petrolether. After the addition of 100 μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoro-acetamide (BSTFA, with 1% trimethyl-chlorosilane, Sigma-Aldrich), the samples were incubated at 70 °C for 60 min. Trimethylsilylated fatty acid methyl esters (TMS-FAMEs) were analyzed by GLC and GLC-MS. Stereochemical Analysis of Hydroxy Fatty Acids—Identification of the (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers of 2-hydroxy-Δ3(E) fatty acids was performed as described previously (31Rietschel E.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 64: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Wollenweber H.W. Schramek S. Moll H. Rietschel E.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 142: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. FAMEs (50-100 μg), isolated as described above, were first reduced with H2/PtO2 in chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v) at room temperature (2-5 min). GLC Analysis—GLC analysis was carried out in a CP3900 (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) with a flame ionization detector using a Select FAME® column (Varian; 50 m, 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness) with a temperature gradient starting from 100 °C (hold for 1 min) to 200 °C at 3 °C/min and continuing with 10 °C/min to 275 °C (8-min hold). Helium was used as carrier gas. Chromatograms were recorded and processed using the Galaxie chromatography data system (Varian). GLC-MS—GLC-MS analysis was done on an HP 5975 inert XL mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) using an HP-5 MS fused silica column (30 m, 0.25-mm inner diameter, 0.25-μm film thickness) with a temperature gradient starting from 150 °C (3 min) to 320 °C at 5 °C/min. Electron impact mass spectra were carried out at 70 eV. Electrospray Ionization Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Mass Spectrometry (ESI FT-ICR MS)—ESI FT-ICR MS was performed in the positive ion mode using a high resolution APEX-QE instrument (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a 7-tesla actively shielded magnet and an Apollo ion source. Mass spectra were acquired using standard experimental sequences as provided by the manufacturer. Samples were dissolved at a concentration of ∼10 ng/μl in a 50:50:0.001 (v/v/v) mixture of 2-propanol, water, and 30 mm ammonium acetate adjusted with acetic acid to pH 5 and sprayed at a flow rate of 2 μl/min. Capillary entrance voltage was set to 3.8 kV, and dry gas temperature was set to 175 °C. The obtained mass spectra were charge deconvoluted, and the mass numbers given refer to the monoisotopic masses of the neutral molecules. NMR Spectroscopy—One-dimensional 1H and two-dimensional homonuclear and H-detected heteronuclear and 1H,13C-correlation spectra were recorded on a 600-MHz spectrometer (Bruker Avance DRX-600) at 300 K. Spectra were taken from 0.1-0.5 mg of glucosylceramide, isolated from F. graminearum wild type and the Δ3(E)-desaturase expression mutant of P. pastoris, in 3-mm tubes (Ultra Precision, Norell, Landisville, NJ). The peracetylated samples were dissolved in 0.25 ml of deuterated chloroform (99.96%, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA) using tetramethylsilane (δH = 0.000) and chloroform (δC = 77.0) as internal reference. The native glycolipids were dissolved in 0.25 ml of deuterated methanol (99.96%, Deutero, Kastellaun, Germany) using methanol (δH = 3.34, δC = 48.86) as internal reference. One-dimensional (1H-) and two-dimensional homonuclear (1H,1H-COSY (correlation spectroscopy), TOCSY (total correlation spectroscopy), ROESY (rotational frame Overhauser spectroscopy)) and H-detected heteronuclear (1H,13C-HMQC (heteronuclear multiple-quantum coherence experiment)) experiments were recorded and processed using standard Bruker software (XWINNMR, version 3.5). Glucosylceramide from F. graminearum Contains Δ3(E)-Unsaturated Fatty Acids—GlcCer of F. graminearum strain PH-1 is known to contain Δ3(E)-unsaturated fatty acids (23Ramamoorthy V. Cahoon E.B. Li J. Thokala M. Minto R.E. Shah D.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 771-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To check whether this is also true for the strain 8/1, which was used in this study, GlcCer was isolated, purified, and subjected to ESI FT-ICR MS analysis (data not shown). Scheme 1 shows the GlcCer structures as determined by NMR spectroscopy and ESI/MS. The native GlcCer, 1, had main peaks originating from [M+H]+ and [M+Na]+, yielding a molecular mass of 753.5785 Da, which is almost identical to the calculated mass for C43H79O9N (753.5755 Da). This mass is in agreement with fungal GlcCer containing the sphingoid base (4E,8E)-9-methylsphinga-4,8-dienine linked to a hydroxylated monounsaturated C18-fatty acid, 1. The same observations could be made with the peracetylated derivative of GlcCer, 2 (data not shown). The position and configuration of the double bond in the fatty acyl moiety was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy (for coupling constants, see supplemental Tables 1 and 2) and assigned as Δ3(E). Therefore, strain 8/1 was suitable for this study. The Extent of Δ3(E)-Unsaturation in Fusarium Varies with the Growth Temperature—Many fungi respond to decreasing temperatures with increasing unsaturation of membrane lipids (33Suutari M. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 164: 212-216Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We thought it might be worthwhile to check whether the Δ3(E)-content of GlcCer in F. graminearum is also affected by variations in temperature. Therefore, F. graminearum strain 8/1 was grown in CM for 3 and 7 days at different temperatures, and the lipids were extracted. The composition of total fatty acids (supplemental Fig. 1) was analyzed by GLC and quantified. Linolenic acid (18:3) represented ∼30% of total fatty acids isolated from cells grown at 18 °C. With increasing growth temperature, the proportion of 18:3 decreased to 12% (28 °C) and 10% (30 °C), respectively. This is in line with the observations made by Suutari (33Suutari M. Arch. Microbiol. 1995; 164: 212-216Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Because GlcCer represents only a small proportion of total lipids, the typical 2-hydroxy-unsaturated fatty acids could not be detected in the samples of total cellular fatty acids. Therefore, GlcCer was purified, and its fatty acids were analyzed using GLC (Fig. 2A), showing that the degree of unsaturation varied. GlcCer of cultures grown at 18 °C contained almost exclusively Δ3-unsaturated hydroxy fatty acids. At 28 °C, ∼75% of the hydroxy fatty acids were unsaturated, whereas the level of unsaturation decreased to 25% at a growth temperature of 30 °C. No differences in the extent of Δ3-unsaturated fatty acids in GlcCer were measured between cultures grown at the same temperature but for different incubation periods (3 or 7 days). The proportion of (3E)-double bonds in GlcCer of F. graminearum greatly changed within a very narrow temperature range (28-30 °C), which is in contrast to the continuously changing proportion of linolenic acid in phosphoglycerolipids (Fig. 2B). Identification of a Putative Sphingolipid Δ3(E)-Desaturase Family with Members from Euascomycete Fungi—A bioinformatics strategy developed by Ternes et al. (20Ternes P. Franke S. Zähringer U. Sperling P. Heinz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25512-25518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) was adapted to identify candidate sequences for Δ3(E)-desaturases. Using PSI-BLAST with the S. cerevisiae sphingolipid α-hydroxylase Scs7p (14Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and the Δ11-acyl group desaturase from T. pseudonana (25Tonon T. Harvey D. Qing R. Li Y. Larson T.R. Graham I.A. FEBS Lett. 2004; 563: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) as queries, a collection of sequences with the histidine box motifs was assembled. The final collection of desaturase-like sequences was grouped into families, and a putative biochemical function was assessed to each family based on published experimental results (Fig. 3). This led to the identification of one additional family matching the following criteria. 1) The family comprised only sequences with so far unknown function, 2) it was present in all completely sequenced genomes of euascomycetes, 3) it was missing in yeasts and in all other fungi, and 4) it was also missing in animals. Initially, the candidate family contained six sequences from A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, F. graminearum, M. grisea, and N. crassa, but with more sequenced genomes of euascomycetes being published, this number could be raised (supplemental Table 3). The polypeptide sequences of the candidate family vary in length between 400 and 500 amino acids. They neither possess a C-terminal nor an N-terminal cytochrome b5 domain, but they contain the three histidine boxes characteristic for membrane-bound desaturases. For all putative proteins, four transmembrane helices were predicted, using the program TMHMM (34Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar). This is in line with topology predictions for other membrane-bound desaturases (Ref. 13Dunn T.M. Haak D. Monaghan E. Beeler T.J. Yeast. 1998; 14: 311-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, and reviewed in Ref. 35Sperling P. Ternes P. Zank T.K. Heinz E. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2003; 68: 73-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Positions of the histidine boxes and putative transmembrane domains are shown in Fig. 4. Desaturases can generally be divided in two groups based on a different spacing between the first and the second histidine box. The Δ3(E)-desaturase candidate family belongs to the group with a long spacing like the sphingolipid-Δ4(E)- and the sphingolipid-Δ8-desaturases (Fig. 3). The α-hydroxylases, which were expected to be more closely related to Δ3-desaturases than other desaturases, however, belong to the group with short spacing. From the identified putative Δ3(E)-desaturase family, we selected the candidate protein from F. graminearum to elucidate its apparent enzymatic function. Cloning of the Candidate Sphingolipid-Δ3(E)-Desaturase Gene from F. graminearum—Genomic DNA isolated from F. graminearum strain 8/1 was used as a template for PCR. The complete open reading frame (including two predicted introns) coding for the candidate sequence was amplified and cloned into the vector pGEM®-T. Sequencing revealed seven alterations when compared with the published sequence Fg05382 (XP_383758) from the sequenced strain PH-1. These changes led to three amino acid differences in the predicted polypeptide, indicating variations between the isolates PH-1 and 8/1. Also, cDNA obtained from F. graminearum was amplified by PCR, cloned into pGEM®-T, and sequenced. Except for the introns, genomic and cDNA sequences were identical, both displaying the same differences to XP_383758 from strain PH-1. The genomic sequence and the cDNA sequence are deposited in GenBank™ under accession numbers FJ176922 (genom"
https://openalex.org/W2029610828,"The ability of actin filaments to function in cell morphogenesis and motility is closely coupled to their dynamic properties. Yeast cells contain two prominent actin structures, cables and patches, both of which are rapidly assembled and disassembled. Although genetic studies have shown that rapid actin turnover in patches and cables depends on cofilin, how cofilin might control cable disassembly remains unclear, because tropomyosin, a component of actin cables, is thought to protect actin filaments against the depolymerizing activity of ADF/cofilin. We have identified cofilin as a yeast tropomyosin (Tpm1) binding protein through Tpm1 affinity column and mass spectrometry. Using a variety of assays, we show that yeast cofilin can efficiently depolymerize and sever yeast actin filaments decorated with either Tpm1 or mouse tropomyosins TM1 and TM4. Our results suggest that yeast cofilin has the intrinsic ability to promote actin cable turnover, and that the severing activity may rely on its ability to bind Tpm1."
https://openalex.org/W2129847761,"To optimize motor performance, both the amplitude and temporal properties of movements should be modifiable by motor learning. Here we report that the modification of movement timing is highly dependent on signaling through P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels. Two lines of mutant mice heterozygous for P/Q-type voltage-dependent calcium channels exhibited impaired plasticity of eye movement timing, but relatively intact plasticity of movement amplitude during motor learning in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. The results thus demonstrate a distinction between the molecular signaling pathways regulating the timing versus amplitude of movements."
https://openalex.org/W1994940767,"The ADP-ribosylation factor-like (Arl) family of small G proteins are involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. Arl2 does not appear to be membrane localized and has been implicated as a regulator of microtubule dynamics. The downstream effector for Arl2, Binder of Arl 2 (BART) has no known function but, together with Arl2, can enter mitochondria and bind the adenine nucleotide transporter. We have solved the solution structure of BART and show that it forms a novel fold composed of six alpha-helices that form three interlocking ""L"" shapes. Analysis of the backbone dynamics reveals that the protein is highly anisotropic and that the loops between the central helices are dynamic. The regions involved in the binding of Arl2 were mapped onto the surface of BART and are found to localize to these loop regions. BART has faces of differing charge and structural elements, which may explain how it can interact with other proteins."
