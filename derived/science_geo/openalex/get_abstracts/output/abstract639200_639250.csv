https://openalex.org/W2971991145,"To evaluate the incidence of Acanthamoeba keratitis in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2015 and to analyse predicting factors for treatment outcome.Patient characteristics, diagnostic methods, diagnostic delay, therapy prior to and after diagnosis, and visual outcome were obtained from medical files of all patients diagnosed with Acanthamoeba keratitis in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2015. A logistic regression analysis on treatment failure, defined as a best corrected visual acuity of less than 20/40 Snellen decimals (i.e. >0.3 logMAR or an approximate loss of three lines of visual acuity) and/or the need for keratoplasty, was performed to determine predicting factors.Two hundred and twenty-four eyes of 224 patients were included. Ninety-five percent of the patients were contact lens wearers, of whom 74% wore soft contact lenses. The number of cases increased from 16 in 2009 to 49 in 2015. This resulted in an estimated incidence of 1 in 21,000 for soft contact lens wearers in 2015. Eighty-seven eyes (39%) met the criteria for treatment failure. In a multivariable regression analysis, higher age at presentation, a higher severity stage and corticosteroid use before diagnosis were positively correlated with treatment failure. Early referral to a cornea specialist was associated with better clinical outcomes.Although Acanthamoeba keratitis is still a relatively uncommon disease, the incidence in soft contact lens wearers has increased to reach 1 in 21,000 in 2015. Treatment failure occurred in 39% of cases, with age, higher severity stage, corticosteroid use before diagnosis and indirect referral to a cornea specialist as important risks factors."
https://openalex.org/W2971398402,"Since carotenoids are important as natural colorants, antioxidants, neutraceutics and pharmaceutics, the aim of the present study was to find a new good source of these pigments. We hereby report a green microalga Asterarcys quadricellulare PUMCC 5.1.1 as a new and good producer of carotenoids. The organism produced 35±1.75 μg carotenoids mg−1 dry biomass during stationary phase in control cultures. The growth and carotenoids production by the test microalga were optimized by varying nutrient growth media, pH, nitrogen and phosphate source, salinity, light quality, intensity and duration. The optimized conditions for carotenoid production were: Bold basal (BB) medium with pH 8.5, containing with10 mM nitrate, 3.5 mM phosphate and 0.17 mM salinity and illuminated with blue light with 60 μmol m-2 s-1 photon flux light intensity. Cultivation of cultures in the above mentioned optimized conditions resulted in nearly 3.0 fold increase in carotenoid production compared to the control cultures grown in unmodified BB medium. Using HPTLC, four carotenoids have been identified as β-carotene, lutein, astaxanthin and canthaxanthin. Further, carotenoids were also separated and purified by flash chromatography and the amounts of purified carotenoids were determined by HPLC. The organism produced 47.0, 28.7, 15.5 and 14.0 μg β-carotene, lutein, astaxanthin and canthaxanthin mg−1 dry biomass, respectively, under optimized conditions. The amount of total carotenoids (118 μg mg-1 dry biomass) produced by Asterarcys quadricellulare PUMCC 5.1.1 under optimized culture conditions was significantly higher than control cultures. Thus, this microalgal strain is a promising candidate for carotenoid production at commercial level."
https://openalex.org/W2971921871,"Prejudiced attitudes and political nationalism vary widely around the world, but there has been little research on what predicts this variation. Here we examine the ecological and cultural factors underlying the worldwide distribution of prejudice. We suggest that cultures grow more prejudiced when they tighten cultural norms in response to destabilizing ecological threats. A set of seven archival analyses, surveys, and experiments (∑N = 3,986,402) find that nations, American states, and pre-industrial societies with tighter cultural norms show the most prejudice based on skin color, religion, nationality, and sexuality, and that tightness predicts why prejudice is often highest in areas of the world with histories of ecological threat. People's support for cultural tightness also mediates the link between perceived ecological threat and intentions to vote for nationalist politicians. Results replicate when controlling for economic development, inequality, conservatism, residential mobility, and shared cultural heritage. These findings offer a cultural evolutionary perspective on prejudice, with implications for immigration, intercultural conflict, and radicalization."
https://openalex.org/W2972061763,"Deposition of polydisperse particles representing nasal spray application in a human nasal cavity was performed under transient breathing profiles of sniffing, constant flow, and breath hold. The LES turbulence model was used to describe the fluid phase. Particles were introduced into the flow field with initial spray conditions, including spray cone angle, insertion angle, and initial velocity. Since nasal spray atomizer design determines the particle conditions, fifteen particle size distributions were used, each defined by a log-normal distribution with a different volume mean diameter (Dv50). Particle deposition in the anterior region was approximately 80% when Dv50 > 50μm, and this decreased to 45% as Dv50 decreased to 10μ m for constant and sniff breathing conditions. The decrease in anterior deposition was countered with increased deposition in the middle and posterior regions. The significance of increased deposition in the middle region for drug delivery shows there is potential for nasal delivered drugs to reach the highly vascularised mucosal walls in the main nasal passages. For multiple targeted deposition sites, an optimisation equation was introduced where deposition results of any two targeted sites could be combined and a weighting between 0 to 1 was applied to each targeted site, representing the relative importance of each deposition site."
https://openalex.org/W2971588164,"We present a novel approach based on deep learning for decoding sensory information from non-invasively recorded Electroencephalograms (EEG). It can either be used in a passive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) to predict properties of a visual stimulus the person is viewing, or it can be used to actively control a BCI application. Both scenarios were tested, whereby an average information transfer rate (ITR) of 701 bit/min was achieved for the passive BCI approach with the best subject achieving an online ITR of 1237 bit/min. Further, it allowed the discrimination of 500,000 different visual stimuli based on only 2 seconds of EEG data with an accuracy of up to 100%. When using the method for an asynchronous self-paced BCI for spelling, an average utility rate of 175 bit/min was achieved, which corresponds to an average of 35 error-free letters per minute. As the presented method extracts more than three times more information than the previously fastest approach, we suggest that EEG signals carry more information than generally assumed. Finally, we observed a ceiling effect such that information content in the EEG exceeds that required for BCI control, and therefore we discuss if BCI research has reached a point where the performance of non-invasive visual BCI control cannot be substantially improved anymore."
https://openalex.org/W2971874987,"A physiologically relevant in vitro human-based model could be the ‘gold standard’ to clarify the pathological steps involved in glaucoma onset. In this regard, human 3D cultures may represent an excellent starting point to achieve this goal. Indeed, the 3D matrix allows to re-create the in vivo-like tissue architecture, maintaining its functionality and cellular behaviour, compared to the 2D model. Thus, we propose a comparison between the 2D and 3D in vitro models of human trabecular meshwork cells in terms of cellular responses after chronic stress exposure. Our results showed that 3D-cells are more sensitive to intracellular reactive oxidative specie production induced by hydrogen peroxide treatment, compared to 2D cultures. Additionally, in 3D cultures a more accurate regulation of the apoptosis trigger and cell adaptation mechanisms was detected than in 2D models. In line with these findings, the 3D-HTMC model shows the ability to better mimic the in vivo cell behaviour in adaptive responses to chronic oxidative stress than 2D."
https://openalex.org/W2972098438,"A limited number of studies have used objective measures to examine the associations between the built environment and physical activity (PA) among older adults. This study aimed to examine geographic information systems-derived neighborhood walkability attributes and accelerometer measured PA in older adults. Data were collected from 124 older Taiwanese adults aged over 60 years (mean age: 69.9). Adjusted multiple linear regression was performed to explore the associations between five neighborhood walkability factors (population density, street connectivity, sidewalk availability, access to destinations, and public transportation) and five metrics of accelerometer-measured physical activity (total PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, light PA, long moderate-to-vigorous PA bouts, and daily step counts). After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that greater sidewalk availability was positively associated with daily step counts in older adults (β = 0.165; 95% confidence interval: 0.006, 0.412; P = 0.043). No associations between other neighborhood environment attributes and PA metrics were observed. In conclusion, high sidewalk availability in the neighborhood may be supportive for older adults’ daily step counts. Further longitudinal research is needed to establish the causality between the built environment and objectively measured PA in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W2972146003,"A recent study from Sweden showed that European hedgehogs may constitute a reservoir for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but this host-parasite relationship remains to be investigated in other countries. In this study, we therefore sought to: 1) determine the dissemination of MRSA in European hedgehogs throughout Denmark; 2) investigate determinants of MRSA carriage in hedgehogs; 3) determine the potential for zoonotic transmission of MRSA from hedgehogs to humans; and 4) characterise the detected MRSA on both a phenotypic and molecular level.Nasal swabs were taken from 188 dead hedgehogs collected by volunteers throughout Denmark to determine the occurrence of MRSA. Additionally, 16 hedgehog rehabilitators were tested for potential zoonotic transmission of MRSA from hedgehogs to humans. The swabs were incubated in tryptic soy broth supplemented with 6.5% NaCl, followed by spread of 10 μl on Brilliance MRSA 2 agar. One presumptive MRSA colony from each plate was subcultured on 5% blood agar. All S. aureus subcultures were verified by a PCR assay detecting mecA, mecC, lukF-PV, scn, and spa, followed by spa typing.A total of 114 (61%) hedgehogs carried mecC-MRSA, whereas none carried mecA-MRSA. The detected mecC-MRSA belonged to two genetic lineages CC130 (spa-types: t528, t843, t1048, t3256, t3570, t6220, t17133) and CC1943 (spa-types: t978, t2345, t3391, t8835, t16868), 52% of which were spa-type t843 (CC130).The detection rate of mecC-MRSA in the hedgehogs was similar regardless of cause of death, sex, region and habitat type. None of the hedgehog rehabilitators carried MRSA.This nationwide study confirms a high occurrence of mecC-MRSA in hedgehogs, which could serve as a natural reservoir for this specific type of MRSA. Furthermore, our study did not find signs of zoonotic transmission of mecC-MRSA to hedgehog rehabilitators."
https://openalex.org/W2972298649,"The cancer stem cell concept proposes that tumor growth and recurrence is driven by a small population of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In this study we investigated the expression of induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) markers and their localization in primary low-grade adenocarcinoma (LGCA) and high-grade adenocarcinoma (HGCA) and their patient-matched normal colon samples.Transcription and translation of iPSC markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4 and c-MYC were investigated using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, RT-qPCR and in-situ hybridization (ISH).All five iPSC markers were detected at the transcriptional and translational levels. Protein abundance was found to be correlated with tumor grade. Based on their protein expression within the tumors, two sub-populations of cells were identified: a NANOG+/OCT4- epithelial subpopulation and an OCT4+/NANOG- stromal subpopulation. All cases were accurately graded based on four pieces of iPSC marker-related data.This study suggests the presence of two putative sub-populations of CSCs: a NANOG+/OCT4- epithelial subpopulation and an OCT4+/NANOG- stromal subpopulation. Normal colon, LGCA and HGCA could be accurately distinguished from one another using iPSC marker expression. Once validated, novel combinations of iPSC markers may provide diagnostic and prognostic value to help guide patient management."
https://openalex.org/W2971776326,"This study investigated the associations between abundance of rumen ciliate protozoa and the proportion of the main bioactive fatty acids related to rumen biohydrogenation, as 18:0, t10-18:1, t11-18:1, c9,t11-18:2, 18:3n-3 and 18:2 n-6, in rumen and meat of growing lambs, using data derived from 3 production experiments. A global correlation analysis and a linear regression analysis considering the effect of the experiment were performed. Ten of the 86 lambs involved in the experiments did not present ciliate cells in rumen liquor and the remaining lambs presented an average of 1.35 × 106ciliates / ml rumen liquor. From the nine genera of ciliates identified, Entodinium was the most abundant, averaging 1.17 × 106 cells / ml of rumen liquor. A large variation among lambs was observed for both rumen concentration and community structure of ciliates. Rumen t11-18:1 (P < 0.001) and meat deposition of t11-18:1 (P < 0.001) and of c9,t11-18:2 (P < 0.001) increased linearly with total ciliates, whereas the t10/t11 ratio in rumen (P = 0.002) and in meat (P = 0.036) decreased linearly. Entodiniomorphids seems to be strongly related with meat deposition oft11-18:1 and c9,t11-18:2 and with the reduction of the trans-10 shifted pathway. Completeness of RBH decreased linearly with Holotrichs (P = 0.029), Entodiniomorphids (P = 0.029), Isotricha (P = 0.011) and Epidinium (P = 0.027) abundances. Rumen 18:0 also decreased linearly with increasing counts of total ciliates (P = 0.015), Holotrichs (P = 0.020), Entodiniomorphids (P = 0.010) and Isotricha (P = 0.014). Rumen protozoa were positively linked with the deposition of healthy bioactive FA and simultaneously negatively associated with the occurrence of trans-10 shift."
https://openalex.org/W2971575793,"With India preparing for the next decennial Census in 2021, we compared the disability estimates and data collection methodology between the Census 2011 and the most recent population-level survey for India and its states, to highlight the issues to be addressed to improve robustness of the disability estimates in the upcoming Census.Data from the Census 2011 and from two complementary nationally representative household surveys that covered all Indian states with the same methodology and survey instruments-the District-Level Household Survey-4 (DLHS-4, 2012-2013) and the Annual Health Surveys (AHS three rounds, 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2012-13) were used. Data from DLHS-4 and AHS 2012-13 round were pooled to generate estimates for the year 2012-13. Data collection methodology between the sources was compared, including the review of definitions of each type of disability. The overall, mental, visual, hearing, speech, and movement disability rate (DR) per 100,000 population were compared between the sources for India and for each state, and the percent difference in the respective rates was calculated. We explored the reliability of these estimates comparing yearly data from the AHS for three successive rounds.Survey data were collected through proxy reporting, however, it is not entirely clear whether the data were proxy- or self-reported or a mix of both in the Census. The overall DR was 25.1% higher in the Census (2,242; 95% CI 2,241-2,243) than the survey (1,791; 95% CI 1,786-1,797) per 100,000 population, with the state-level difference ranging from -64% in Tamil Nadu to 107% in Sikkim state. Despite both sources using nearly similar definitions for overall disability and disability by type, the difference in DR was 125.5%, 54.2%, -25.7%, -19.7%, and 21.9% for hearing, speech, mental, movement, and visual DR, respectively. At the state-level, the difference in disability-specific estimates ranged from -84% to 450%. The extent of variations in the disability-specific estimates in AHS successive rounds ranged from -25% to 929% at the state-level.There is momentum globally towards building disability measurement that is consistent with the data required for monitoring of the Sustainable Development Goals to ensure robust estimation of disability. The current estimates from the Census and surveys seem much lower than would be expected at the population level. We make recommendations that India needs to take serious note of in order to improve the validity and reliability of India's disability estimates."
https://openalex.org/W2971918491,"Background Ocular involvement of candidemia can result in serious complications, including vision loss. This study investigated the risk factors for ocular involvement in patients with candidemia and the outcomes of treatment. Methods Episodes of candidemia in hospitalized adults who underwent ophthalmic examinations within 2 weeks of candidemia onset between January 2014 and May 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Their demographic characteristics, antifungal treatments, and visual outcomes were evaluated. Results During the study period, 438 adults were diagnosed with candidemia, with 275 (62.8%) undergoing ophthalmic examinations within 2 weeks. Of these 275 patients, 59 (21.5%) had fundoscopic abnormalities suggestive of ocular involvement, including 51 with chorioretinitis and eight with Candida endophthalmitis. Eleven patients were symptomatic. Persistent candidemia (adjusted odd ratio [aOR], 2.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29–5.08; P = 0.01), neutropenia during the preceding 2 weeks (aOR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.14–7.53; P = 0.03), and C. albicans infection (aOR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.09–4.24; P = 0.03) were independently associated with ocular involvement. Among the 24 patients with neutropenia, 41.7% had ocular involvements at the initial examination. Ophthalmologic examination even before the neutrophil recovery was positive in one-third of neutropenic patients. Out of the 37 patients in whom ocular outcomes after 6 weeks were available, 35 patients showed favorable or stable fundoscopic findings. Two patients had decreased visual acuity despite the stable fundoscopic finding. Conclusion Neutropenia within two weeks of candidemia was a risk factor for ocular involvement. More than 80 percent of patients with ocular involvements were asymptomatic, emphasizing the importance of routine ophthalmic examinations. The median 6 weeks of systemic antifungal treatment resulted in favorable outcomes in 89.2% of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2971991340,"Pathological assessments of the treatment effect are critical for predicting patient outcomes after surgery. This study included 82 localized pancreatic cancer, 40 of whom were treated with neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) using four courses of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) followed by pancreatectomy (GnP group). The remaining 42 patients were treated with upfront pancreatectomy (UP) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (UP group). We reviewed clinicopathological data of these patients to assess differences between the GnP and UP groups and further evaluate the prognostic impact of residual tumors after GnP treatment. Adjuvant treatment (S1, GnP or gemcitabine) was administered for 36 patients in the GnP group and 33 patients in the UP group. Compared to the UP group, the GnP group showed lower serum CA19-9 levels, microscopic tumor volume, and tumor-stroma ratio and decreased number of lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion. Higher incidence of encapsulating fibrosis was observed in the GnP group than in the UP group. Relative to the UP group (69%), a higher R0 rate was observed in the GnP group (85%). As for prognosis, encapsulating fibrosis was correlated with the overall survival of patients in the GnP group. However, overall survival did not show any correlation with other clinicopathological factors, including tumor reduction ratio (determined by computed tomography) and tumor regression grade (determined following criteria of Evans’ grading system or those of the College of American Pathologists). In conclusion, the present study revealed that GnP-induced encapsulating fibrosis could predict patients’ outcome. Nevertheless, large cohort studies are warranted to further evaluate the prognostic value of fibrosis, possibly with the help of imaging and biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2971772017,"Tinnitus and hearing impairment are prevalent among headache patients. This study aims to investigate the risk of tinnitus, sensorineural hearing impairment, and sudden deafness in patients with non-migraine headache. Participants included 43 294 patients with non-migraine headache (non-migraine headache cohort) and 173 176 patients with no headache of any type (control cohort) frequency-matched with respect to 10-year age interval and sex from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2005 of the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. The mean age of the non-migraine headache cohort was 28.4 ± 14.9 years, and 58.5% of this cohort was male. The incidence rates of tinnitus, sensorineural hearing impairment, and sudden deafness were compared between cohorts using the Kaplan–Meier method with the log-rank test. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to examine the association of tinnitus, sensorineural hearing impairment, and sudden deafness with non-migraine headache, with adjustment for all covariates. The combined risk of either tinnitus, sensorineural hearing impairment, or sudden deafness was higher in the non-migraine headache cohort than in the control cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aHR], 2.73; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.62–2.84; p < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed that patients in the non-migraine headache cohort were at significantly higher risk of developing tinnitus (aHR, 3.05; 95% CI, 2.91–3.19; p < 0.0001), sensorineural hearing impairment (aHR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.74–2.05; p < 0.0001), and sudden deafness (aHR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.77–2.59; p < 0.0001) than were controls. In this population-based study, the risks of tinnitus, sensorineural hearing impairment, and sudden deafness were found to be significantly higher in patients with non-migraine headache than in those without headache."
https://openalex.org/W2972260742,"Elevated expression of the iron regulatory protein, ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1), is increasingly being associated with high tumor grade and poor survival outcomes in glioblastoma. Glioma initiating cells (GICs), a small population of stem-like cells implicated in therapeutic resistance and glioblastoma recurrence, have recently been shown to exhibit increased FTH1 expression. We previously demonstrated that FTH1 knockdown enhanced therapeutic sensitivity in an astrocytoma cell line. Therefore, in this study we developed a liposomal formulation to enable the in vitro delivery of FTH1 siRNA in patient xenograft derived GICs from glioblastomas with pro-neural and mesenchymal transcriptional signatures to interrogate the effect of FTH1 downregulation on their radiation sensitivity. Transfection with siRNA decreased FTH1 expression significantly in both GICs. However, there were inherent differences in transfectability between pro-neural and mesenchymal tumor derived GICs, leading us to modify siRNA: liposome ratios for comparable transfection. Moreover, loss of FTH1 expression resulted in increased extracellular lactate dehydrogenase activity, executioner caspase 3/7 induction, substantial mitochondrial damage, diminished mitochondrial mass and reduced cell viability. However, only GICs from pro-neural glioblastoma showed marked increase in radiosensitivity upon FTH1 downregulation demonstrated by decreased cell viability, impaired DNA repair and reduced colony formation subsequent to radiation. In addition, the stemness marker Nestin was downregulated upon FTH1 silencing only in GICs of pro-neural but not mesenchymal origin. Using liposomes as a siRNA delivery system, we established FTH1 as a critical factor for survival in both GIC subtypes as well as a regulator of radioresistance and stemness in pro-neural tumor derived GICs. Our study provides further evidence to support the role of FTH1 as a promising target in glioblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2971909392,"The integral role of sleep in cognition, such as night-time sleep and napping duration, has yielded mixed findings, especially in healthy elderly adults. This study aimed to identify the heterogeneous classes of the cognitive trajectories and investigated the associations between sleep parameters and the trajectories of cognition in different elderly subpopulations. The study was based on a large, national representative sample aged 60 years or older. Two cognitive measures were assessed, including executive function and episodic memory. Sleep parameters were evaluated, including post-lunch napping, night-time sleep duration, and sleep disturbances. Latent growth mixture model (LGMM) was used to describe the trajectories of cognition and investigate the effects of sleep factors on cognition. Three heterogeneous trajectories were identified for executive cognition and four for episodic memory. Inverted U-shape associations of cognition with night-time sleep and napping duration were found. In LGMM, night-time sleep duration was negatively associated with the baseline episodic memory in elderly adults. Post-lunch napping was positively associated with the baseline executive function (β = 0.078, P<0.05) and episodic memory (β = 0.084, P<0.05) in men, whereas it was only associated with impaired episodic memory (β = -0.152, P<0.05) in women. Frequent sleep disturbances were only associated with the impaired executive function at baseline (β = -0.088, 95%CI -0.162, -0.013) among older men. Overall, sleep parameters played different roles in heterogeneous trajectories of cognition by sex difference. Sleep factors may not be related to the rate of cognition decline, but these factors, independent of time-variant depressive symptoms, were associated with the initial status of cognition at baseline."
https://openalex.org/W2971972182,"As of November 1, 2018, China's ""One Belt and One Road"" Initiative has involved 123 countries and promoted worldwide communication, cooperation and trade exchange. This paper constructs correlation networks of exchange rates among the countries along ""The Belt and Road"" and analyzes the risk contagion structure. It is found that when ""The Belt and Road"" initiative is initialized, countries in Eastern Europe occupy important positions in the network and play a vital role in the spreading of exchange rate risks; however, during the process of ""The Belt and Road"" initiative, the exchange rate risks are decentralized geographically, whereas they are centralized in countries that have in-depth communication and cooperation. The minimum Spanning Tree method is also proposed to investigate the structure of complex networks. It is found that the geographical link between exchange rate fluctuations and correlations among the countries has been strengthened while China has become an important node in the exchange rate network after the launch of ""The Belt and Road"" initiative. In addition, the influence and promotion of RMB has rapidly benefited from the initiative."
https://openalex.org/W2971934062,"Pregnane X receptor (PXR) regulates the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transport enzymes. NF-κB not only plays a role in liver homeostasis and injury-healing processes by regulating inflammatory responses but may also regulate the transcription of PXR. Currently, genetic polymorphisms in PXR are associated with adverse drug effects. Because little is known about the association between NF-κB1 genetic polymorphisms and adverse drug reactions, we explored the association between PXR and NF-κB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and susceptibility to anti-tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI).A total of 746 tuberculosis patients (118 with ATDILI and 628 without ATDILI) were prospectively enrolled at West China Hospital between December 2014 and April 2018. Nine selected SNPs (rs3814055, rs13059232, rs7643645 and rs3732360 in PXR and rs78872571, rs4647992, rs60371688, rs1598861 and rs3774959 in NF-κB1) were genotyped with a custom-designed 2x48-plex SNP Scan TM Kit. The frequencies of the alleles, genotypes and genetic models of the variants were compared between patients with or without ATDILI, while joint effect analysis of the SNP-SNP interactions was performed using multiplicative and additive models. The odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.The T allele of rs3814055 in PXR was associated with a decreased risk for ATDILI (OR 0.61; 95% CI: 0.42-0.89, p = 0.0098). The T alleles of rs78872571 and rs4647992 in NF-κB1 were significantly associated with an increased risk for ATDILI (OR 1.91; 95% CI: 1.06-3.43, p = 0.028 and OR 1.81; 1.06-3.10, p = 0.029, respectively). The allele, genotype and genetic model frequencies were similar in the two groups for the other six SNPs (all P>0.05). There were no multiplicative or additive interactions between the SNPs.Our study is the first to reveal that rs3814055 variants in PXR and rs78872571 and rs4647992 variants in NF-κB1 are associated with susceptibility to ATDILI caused by first-line anti-tuberculosis combination treatment in the Han Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W2971934240,"We sought to describe the characteristics that lead physicians to perceive a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) as being non-beneficial for the patient.In the first step, we used a multidisciplinary focus group to define the characteristics that lead physicians to consider a stay in the ICU as non-beneficial for the patient. In the second step, we assessed the proportion of admissions that would be perceived by the ICU physicians as non-beneficial for the patient according to our focus group's definition, in a large population of ICU admissions in 4 French ICUs over a period of 4 months.Among 1075 patients admitted to participating ICUs during the study period, 155 stays were considered non-beneficial for the patient, yielding a frequency of 14.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.9, 19.9]. Average age of these patients was 72 ±12.8 years. Mortality was 43.2% in-ICU [95%CI 35.4, 51.0], 55% [95%CI 47.2, 62.8] in-hospital. The criteria retained by the focus group to define a non-beneficial ICU stay were: patient refusal of ICU care (23.2% [95%CI 16.5, 29.8]), and referring physician's desire not to have the patient admitted (11.6% [95%CI 6.6, 16.6]). The characteristics that led physicians to perceive the stay as non-beneficial were: patient's age (36.8% [95%CI 29.2, 44.4]), unlikelihood of recovering autonomy (61.9% [95%CI 54.3, 69.6]), prior poor quality of life (60% [95%CI 52.3, 67.7]), terminal status of chronic disease (56.1% [95%CI 48.3, 63.9]), and all therapeutic options have been exhausted (35.5% [95%CI 27.9, 43.0]). Factors that explained admission to the ICU of patients whose stay was subsequently judged to be non-beneficial included: lack of knowledge of patient's wishes (52% [95%CI 44.1, 59.9]); decisional incapacity (sedation) (69.7% [95%CI 62.5, 76.9]); inability to contact family (34% [95%CI 26.5, 41.5]); pressure to admit (from family or other physicians) (50.3% [95%CI 42.4, 58.2]).Non-beneficial ICU stays are frequent. ICU admissions need to be anticipated, so that patients who would yield greater benefit from other care pathways can be correctly oriented in a timely manner."
https://openalex.org/W2971955828,"Exaggerated vasoconstriction plays important roles in vascular complication in aging and many diseases like diabetes. Here, we investigated the protective effect of Psiadia punctulata (PP) on advanced glycation end products (AGEs)-induced aggravated vasoconstriction. The effect of total methanol extract of PP leaves (PPT) on AGE-induced vascular injury was studied through bioassay-guided fractionation procedures in order to find the bioactive fraction and isolate the bioactive compounds. Vascular reactivity was studied using the isolated artery technique by adding cumulative concentrations of phenylephrine (PE) or acetyl choline (ACh). In addition, the antiglycating effect, as well as the effect on AGEs intermediates dityrosine and N`-formylkynurenine and their radical scavenging activity were measured. The results showed that PPT alleviated the AGEs-induced aggravated vasoconstriction in a concentration-dependent manner. The bioassay guided fractionation procedures suggested the chloroform fraction (Fr I) to be responsible for the activity. Chemical investigation of this fraction resulted in isolation of four major bioactive compounds that were identified as: umuhengerin (1), gardenin (2), luteolin-3`,4`-dimethyl ether (3), and 5,3`-dihydroxy-6,7,4`,5`-tetramethoxyflavone (4). The four compounds alleviated the exaggerated vasoconstriction in a dose dependent manner. In search for their mechanism of action, we observed that PPT, Fr. I and the isolated compounds did not improve the impaired vasodilation associated with AGEs exposure. PPT, Fr. I and the isolated compounds 1–4 inhibited AGEs formation and their protein oxidation intermediates. Furthermore, PPT, Fr. I and the isolated compounds 1–4 showed weak radical scavenging activity with compound 4 as the most potent. In conclusion, PPT appears to protect against AGEs-induced exaggerated vasoconstriction through antiglycation and radical scavenging activities."
https://openalex.org/W2971606511,"Preterm infants are at increased risk of infections including vaccine preventable diseases. Therefore, timely vaccination is crucial to ensure adequate disease protection. Information on whether preterm infants are vaccinated according to chronological age as recommended is limited in low-income countries.We evaluated the timeliness of vaccination and associated factors among preterm infants at Mulago hospital, Uganda.We conducted a mixed methods study between July 2016 and April 2017. Vaccination dates of preterm infants aged 6-24 months were obtained from child health cards. Additional data were collected using a questionnaire. Five key informant interviews with health workers and two focus group discussions with caregivers were conducted. Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with vaccination timeliness. Qualitative data was transcribed and analysed manually using content thematic approach.We enrolled 350 preterm infants, with a median age of 8.4 months (IQR 6.8-10.8). Less than half, 149/350 (42.6%) of infants received all vaccines within the recommended time range. Timely vaccination was highest for BCG (92%) and lowest for OPV (45.4%). Untimely vaccination was highest for vaccines administered at 6 weeks (DPT 1, PCV 1 and OPV 1) compared to other vaccines in the EPI schedule. Delivering from home or private clinics and vaccine stock-out were significantly associated with untimely BCG and OPV 0 vaccination. Low maternal education level and being very preterm were associated with untimely DPT 1 and DPT 3 receipt. Admission and long stay in the neonatal unit were associated with untimely DPT 1 receipt while extreme low birth weight was associated with untimely DPT 3 vaccination. Increasing parity was associated with untimely measles vaccination. Qualitative findings revealed that lack of knowledge and poor attitudes of health workers and caregivers, gaps in documentation of vaccination status and inadequate communication by health workers hindered timely vaccination.More than half of preterm infants attending a specialised clinic at Mulago National Referral hospital in Uganda did not receive vaccines within the recommended time range. Specific strategies to improve vaccination timeliness in preterm infants are needed especially among the extremely low birth weight, very preterm and those with prolonged hospitalisation."
https://openalex.org/W2971627053,"Nymphaea tetragona Georgi (Nymphaceae) is traditionally used in Asia for the treatment of diarrhea, dysentery and fever. The plant contains various active compounds, including methyl gallate (MG) which are reported to inhibit bacterial virulence mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate the alterations on viability, membrane potential and integrity of Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium exposed to MG in combination with Tylosin (Ty), which is relatively inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, but it is commonly used as a feed additive in livestock. Besides, the effects of sub-inhibitory concentrations of the combination (MT) on the interaction between S. Typhimurium and the host cell, as well as on the indirect host responses, were characterized. Flow cytometry, confocal and electron microscopic examinations were undertaken to determine the effects of MT on S. Typhimurium. The impacts of sub-inhibitory concentrations of MT on biofilm formation, as well as on the adhesion, invasion and intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium were assessed. The result demonstrated significant damage to the bacterial membrane, leakage of cell contents and a reduction in the membrane potential when treated with MT. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of MT significantly reduced (P < 0.05) the biofilm-forming, adhesive and invasive abilities of S. Typhimurium. Exposure to MT drastically reduced the bacterial count in macrophages. Up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10 cytokine genes were detected in intestinal epithelial cells pre-treated with MT. This report is the first to describe the effects of MT against S. Typhimurium. The result indicates a synergistic interaction between MG and Ty against S. Typhimurium. Therefore, the combination may be a promising option to combat S. Typhimurium in swine and, indirectly, safeguard the health of the public."
https://openalex.org/W2971667595,"Efficient RNA extraction methods are needed to study transcript regulation. Such methods must lyse the cell without degrading the genetic material. For cyanobacteria this can be particularly challenging because of the presence of the cyanobacteria cell envelope. The great breath of cyanobacterial shape and size (unicellular, colonial, or filamentous multicellular) created a variety of cell lysis methods. However, there is still a lack of reliable techniques for nucleic acid extraction for several types of cyanobacteria. Here we designed and tested 15 extraction methods using physical, thermic or chemical stress on the filamentous cyanobacteria Planktothrix agardhii. Techniques based on the use of beads, sonication, and heat shock appeared to be too soft to break the Planktothrix agardhii cell envelope, whereas techniques based on the use of detergents degraded the cell envelope but also the RNA. Two protocols allowed to successfully obtain good-quality RNA. The first protocol consisted to manually crush the frozen cell pellet with a pestle and the second was based on the use of high-intensity ultra-sonication. When comparing these two, the high-intensity ultra-sonication protocol was less laborious, faster and allowed to extract 3.5 times more RNA compared to the liquid nitrogen pestle protocol. The high-intensity ultra-sonication protocol was then tested on five Planktothrix strains, this protocol allowed to obtain >8.5 μg of RNA for approximatively 3.5 × 108 cells. The extracted RNA were characterized by 260/280 and 260/230 ratio > to 2, indicating that the samples were devoid of contaminant, and RNA Quality Number > to 7, meaning that the integrity of RNA was preserved with this extraction method. In conclusion, the method we developed based on high-intensity ultra-sonication proved its efficacy in the extraction of Planktothrix RNA and could be helpful for other types of samples."
https://openalex.org/W2971992547,"Rapid antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation has been proven beneficial for patients and the community. We aimed to analyze recent changes in timing of ART initiation in France and consequences of early start.We selected from a prospective nationwide cohort, on 12/31/2017, patients with HIV-1 infection diagnosed between 01/01/2010 and 12/31/2015. We described time from (1) diagnosis to first specialized medical encounter, (2) from this encounter to ART initiation, (3) from diagnosis to first undetectable HIV viral load (VL). We analyzed the determinants of measured temporal trends. A multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess characteristics related with 1-year retention in care.In the 7 245 included patients, median time (1) from HIV diagnosis to first medical encounter was 13 (IQR: 6-32) days, (2) to ART initiation was 27 (IQR: 9-91) days, decreasing from 42 (IQR: 13-272) days in 2010 to 18 (IQR: 7-42) in 2015 (p<0.0001), (3) to first undetectable VL was 257 (IQR: 151-496) days, decreasing from 378 (IQR: 201-810) days in 2010 to 169 (IQR: 97-281) in 2015. After one year, proportion of patients alive and still in care was significantly lower in those in the lower quartile of time from first encounter to ART (<9 days) than those in the higher quartile (>90 days), 79.9% and 85.2%, respectively (p<0.0001).In a country with unrestricted rapid access to ART, keeping recently diagnosed HIV infected patients in care remains challenging. Starting ART rapidly did not seem to be profitable for all and every patient."
https://openalex.org/W2972060318,"Parasites and pathogens are often aggregated in a minority of susceptible hosts within a population, with a majority of individuals harboring low infection intensities. However, determining the relative importance of host traits to explain this heterogeneity is a challenge. One ecologically important pathogen is Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), which causes the disease chytridiomycosis and has been associated with many amphibian population declines worldwide. For many hosts, post-metamorphic stages are generally more susceptible than the larval stage. Yet, examination of the effects of Bd infection at different ages within a life stage, has received little attention. This study investigated the hypothesis that recently-post-metamorphic frogs were more sensitive to chytridiomycosis than older frogs, and that sensitivity to Bd infection decreased as frogs aged. We examined this relationship with Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla) and red legged frogs (Rana aurora). Age had a strong effect on susceptibility to infection, infection intensity, and survival–but not in the directions we had predicted. In both host species, an increase in age was associated with frogs becoming more susceptible to Bd infection, harboring larger infection intensities, and greater risk of mortality. This suggests that the timing of Bd exposure may influence amphibian population dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2971622387,"Powerful shovel-like forelimbs with special shape, structure and biological materials enable mole cricket to digging efficiently. During digging, the tip of the claw needs to wedge into the soil, and the base needs to withstand considerable anti-shear force. In this study, we analysed the structural characteristics, material composition and mechanical properties of the claw teeth using scanning electron microscopy, plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, nanoindentation and finite element analysis. The results show that the tips of claw teeth have a dense and homogeneous structure and a higher hardness and contents of Mn and Zn compared with the base. The structure of the base of claw teeth has an obvious laminar structure and higher fracture resistance. Moreover, it is speculated from the simulation results that basal position of the claw teeth is tough enough to withstand high stress, and the presence of the ribs effectively improves the mechanical stability and load-bearing capacity of the teeth during excavation. The results of this study can provide inspiration for the design of efficient mechanical components and agricultural implements."
https://openalex.org/W2971639339,"Although agriculture is an important source of food and income for food expenditures, women's involvement in the agricultural cropping production process could increase their work load and reduce their BMI. Using three waves of the Tanzania National Panel Survey, we investigate the extent to which time spent in agricultural crop production affects women and men's nutritional status among non-overweight individuals (age 20-65). We also test whether the impact of agricultural cropping work on nutritional status is modified by access to agricultural equipment, and whether gender differences exist. The study finds that time spent in agricultural cropping work is negatively associated with BMI for non-overweight individuals, albeit of small magnitude, and this finding is consistent across different crop production processes. This suggests that agricultural interventions should not ignore the implications of increasing work intensities on nutrition. While increased agricultural production could improve nutritional status by increasing agricultural income and food, the gains in nutritional status could be offset by an increase in work effort of doing agricultural work. Our results suggest that it is possible that access to equipment reduced effort for one production activity, but increased work for other activities in the production process, such as in harvesting. Furthermore, we find that the BMI of women in households with a hand powered sprayer is positively related to time spent in weeding, fertilizing, and non-harvest activities, while it is negatively correlated for men. It is possible that access to a hand powered sprayer may have helped reduce women's work, for example, in weeding, while this was not the case for men's work such as in ridging and fertilizing. Further disaggregation of agricultural activities in the dataset would have been helpful to provide more insights on the gender roles."

Design Focus-group interview. Method Participants were 128 junior secondary school students (Form 1 to Form 3) aged between 12 and 16 years from two secondary schools. We organised focus-group interviews by class (group size = six to nine students). Seventeen groups completed semi-structured interviews regarding their experience, beliefs, and motives for injury prevention in-school and out-of-school. We analysed data by thematic content analysis using a typological approach. Results Higher order themes (N = 7) including in-school and out-of-school motives and social cognitive factors and associated lower-order themes (N = 16), emerged from the analysis corresponding to constructs from trans-contextual model tenets. Conclusions The current study is the first qualitative study to explore junior secondary school students’ experience and perspectives on sport injury prevention, using trans-contextual model as a framework for investigation. The findings contribute to a better understanding on their motivational and social cognitive factors in adopting sport injury prevention. The content of the theme behavior also indicated the inadequacy of students’ knowledge of effective sport injury prevention techniques, and underscored the importance of sport safety education."

Therefore, data on the occurrence of pathogenic organisms on byproducts is extremely scarce and the prevalence and population structure of Staphylococcus aureus on meat processing sidestreams is unknown. Hence, abattoir byproducts of pork origin including ear, forefoot, heart, intestine, liver, rib bone, sternum, bladder, stomach, hind foot and tongue originating from six abattoirs were screened for S. aureus. The obtained isolates were investigated by spa typing and DNA microarray analysis to reveal their genomic profile and population structure. The prevalence of S. aureus was generally low with a mean of 8%. In total, 40 S. aureus strains were detected and assigned to 12 spa types (t015, t1491, t1778, t091, t337, t899, t2922, t7439, t1333, t208, t4049, t034) and seven clonal complexes (CC1, CC7, CC9, CC30, CC45, CC49, CC398). Detected enterotoxin genes included sea, seb, sec, seh, sel and egc encoded toxin genes seg, sei, sem, sen, seo, and seu. None of the isolates harbored genes conferring methicillin resistance, but blaZ/I/R genes causing penicillin resistance were frequently found. In addition, strains from CC398 exhibited tetM and tetK, conferring tetracycline resistance. Similarity calculations based on microarray profiles revealed no association of clonal complexes with particular body parts, but revealed a certain correspondence of clonal complex and originating abattoir."
https://openalex.org/W2971653721,"This paper examines whether tobacco expenditure leads to the crowding out or crowding in of different expenditure items in South Africa. We apply genetic matching to expenditure quartiles of the 2010/2011 South African Income and Expenditure Survey. Genetic matching is a more appealing approach for dealing with the endogeneity of tobacco expenditure that often plagues studies using systems of demand equations. Further, genetic matching provides transparent measures of covariate balance giving the analyst objective means of assessing match success. We find that the poorest tobacco consuming households in South Africa consistently allocate smaller budget shares towards food items than non-smoking households. Specifically, we find that dairy, fruits, nuts and oils are displaced in favour of tobacco expenditure in the two poorest quartiles. Unsurprisingly, food items are never displaced for households in the top two quartiles, given these households’ greater access to resources. Like other studies in the literature, we find that tobacco expenditure consistently crowds-in alcohol across all quartiles confirming the strong complementarities between the two."
https://openalex.org/W2972194424,"A number of viruses and bacterial species have been implicated as contributors to atherosclerosis, potentially providing novel pathways for prevention. Epidemiological studies examining the association between Helicobacter pylori and cardiovascular disease have yielded variable results and no studies have been conducted in nonhuman primates. In this investigation, we examined the relationship between H. pylori infection and atherosclerosis development in socially housed, pre- and postmenopausal cynomolgus macaques consuming human-like diets. Ninety-four premenopausal cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were fed for 36 months an atherogenic diet deriving its protein from either casein lactalbumin(CL) or high isoflavone soy (SOY). Animals were then ovariectomized and fed either the same or the alternate diet for an additional 36 months. Iliac artery biopsies were obtained at the time of ovariectomy and iliac and coronary artery sections were examined at the end of the study. Evidence of H. pylori infection was found in 64% of the monkeys and 46% of animals had live H. pylori within coronary atheromas as determined by mRNA-specific in situ hybridization. There was a significant linear relationship between the densities of gastric and atheroma organisms. Helicobactor pylori infection correlated with increased intimal plaque area and thickness at both the premenopausal and postmenopausal time points and regardless of diet (p< 0.01), although animals consuming the SOY diet throughout had the least amount of atherosclerosis. Additionally, plasma lipid profiles, intimal collagen accumulation, ICAM-1, and plaque macrophage densities were adversely affected by H. pylori infection among animals consuming the CL diet, while the SOY diet had the opposite effect. Plaque measurements were more highly associated with the densities of cagA-positive H. pylori within coronary atheromas than with the densities of gastric organisms, whereas plasma lipid changes were associated with H. pylori infection, but not cagA status. This study provides strong evidence that live H. pylori infects atheromas, exacerbates atherosclerotic plaque development, and alters plasma lipid profiles independently of diet or hormonal status. Finally, socially subordinate animals relative to their dominant counterparts had a greater prevalence of H. pylori, suggesting a stress effect. The results indicate that early H. pylori eradication could prevent or delay development of cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2971700331,"Gender differences in Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease progression and comorbidities have been extensively reported. Using the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infected rhesus macaque model, we show that these differences are apparent very early during the course of infection. Though there were no major changes in the proportions of CD4 T cells or its subsets, central memory CD4 T cells from female macaques were found to differentially regulate a significantly larger number of genes at day 4 post-infection (PI) as compared to males. Pathway analysis revealed divergence of both canonical and biological pathways that persisted at day 10 PI. Changes in gene expression profiles were accompanied by a significant increase in plasma levels of pro-inflammatory mediators such as MCP-1/CCL2, I-TAC/CXCL11, and MIF. Though plasma levels of IFNα did not differ between male and female macaques, the expression levels of IFNα subtype-14, 16, IFNβ, and IFNω were significantly upregulated in the lymph nodes of female macaques at day 10 PI as compared to male macaques. Our results suggest that the pathogenic sequelae seen during chronic infection may be shaped by gender differences in immune responses induced very early during the course of HIV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2971920219,"Objectives The study aim was to determine if a difference exists in skinfold thickness measured by two interchangeable approaches; (1) supraspinale skinfold recommended in the Heath-Carter method and (2) iliac crest skinfold measurement. The question arises as to whether each approach has a similar or different effect on endomorphy determination, and whether there is a possibility to estimate the supraspinale skinfold based on other skinfold measurements. Methods A group of 186 male and 161 female students participated in this study. Anthropometric examination included all somatic measurements, as recommended in the Heath-Carter protocol, and the iliac crest skinfold measurement. Estimation of the supraspinale skinfold was performed based on the multiple linear regression procedure. Results Skinfold thickness measured in the supraspinale and iliac crest differed (p<0.001) in both men (5.41±1.65 mm and 9.55±4.05 mm, respectively) and women (8.87±4.08 mm and 15.20±6.85 mm), respectively. Endomorphy was significantly higher (0.46 in men, 0.63 in women) when the iliac crest skinfold was used. Subscapular skinfold and iliac crest skinfolds were included in the linear regression model for supraspinale skinfold estimation (R2 = 0.724, SE = 0.9 mm and R2 = 0.947, SE = 2.3 mm for men and women, respectively). Conclusion Two common skinfold approaches produced different measurements between the supraspinale and iliac crest skinfolds, which subsequently affected estimated endomorphy. Regression equations for supraspinale skinfold enabled correction of endomorphy in the case of improperly applied measurement (i.e. iliac crest) and thus, could allow for uniform somatotype estimation according to Carter and Heath approach."

We conducted this study to identify the current status of awareness of heart failure in the Korean general population.This cross-sectional nationwide survey recruited a total of 1,032 participants aged 30 years or older, based on a stratification systematic sampling method. A 23-item questionnaire was surveyed through telephone interviews.Although 80% of the participants had heard of heart failure, 47% exactly defined what heart failure is. A minority of participants correctly recognized the lifetime risk of developing heart failure (21%) as well as the mortality (16%) and readmission risk (18%) of heart failure and the cost burden of heart failure admission (28%). Regarding preferred treatment options, 71% of the participants chose a treatment option that could improve the quality of life. Approximately two-thirds of the participants agreed that current medical treatment could reduce mortality and improve the quality of life. More than half of the participants (59%) thought that heart failure patients should live quietly and reduce all physical activities. Across survey items, we found a lower awareness state in the elderly groups and people at lower income and educational levels.The current awareness status of heart failure in the Korean general population is still low. Proactive educational efforts should be made to improve public awareness with special attention to individuals with lower disease awareness."
https://openalex.org/W2964739417,"Previous studies in rodents have indicated that only a minor fraction of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV-Cμ) transcripts carry somatic mutations and are considered memory B cells. This is in marked contrast to humans where nearly all marginal zone B (MZ-B) cells are mutated. Here we show in rats that the proportion of mutated IgM+ MZ-B cells varies significantly between the various IGHV genes analyzed, ranging from 27% mutated IGHV5 transcripts to 65% mutated IGHV4 transcripts. The observed data on mutated sequences in clonally-related B cells with a MZ-B cell or follicular B (FO-B) cell phenotype indicates that mutated IgM+ MZ-B and FO-B cells have a common origin. To further investigate the origin of mutated IgM+ MZ-B cells we determined whether mutations occurred in rearranged IGHV-Cμ transcripts using IGHV4 and IGHV5 genes from neonatal rat MZ-B cells and FO-B cells. We were not able to detect mutations in any of the IGHV4 and IGHV5 genes expressed by MZ-B cells or FO-B cells obtained from neonatal rat spleens. Germinal centres (GCs) are absent from neonatal rat spleen in the first few weeks of their life, and no mutations were found in any of the neonatal sequences, not even in the IGHV4 gene family which accumulates the highest number of mutated sequences (66%) in the adult rat. Therefore, these data do not support the notion that MZ-B cells in rats mutate their IGHV genes as part of their developmental program, but are consistent with the notion that mutated rat MZ-B cells require GCs for their generation. Our findings support that the splenic MZ of rats harbors a significant number of memory type IgM+ MZ-B cells with mutated IGHV genes and propose that these memory MZ-B cells are probably generated as a result of an antigen driven immune response in GCs, which still remains to be proven."
https://openalex.org/W2971638897,"Recreational fishing practices can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems but their catch dynamics are often difficult to quantify, particularly for spearfishing. On coral reefs, the impacts of recreational spearfishing are often considered to be negligible compared to other practices, but the highly selective method adopted by spearfishers can result in locally distinct ecological consequences. Here we investigated the spatial patterns and catch composition of recreational spearfishers on the Great Barrier Reef using an online survey (n = 141 participants) targeted at spearfishers active along the coastline of Queensland. Observations from within the Queensland spearfishing community were also used to explore perceived changes in catches of three functionally distinct spearing targets. Preferred reef regions (coastal, inshore, offshore) differed among spearfishers from Bundaberg (south) to Cooktown (north). The piscivorous coral trout, Plectropomus leopardus, was suggested to be the preferred target comprising 34% (±1.5 SE) of spearfishers' reported catch composition. Spearfishers also noted a variety of changes in their catch composition over time, particularly regarding parrotfishes (decreased landings) and tuskfishes (increased landings). How this relates to the relative abundance and population biology of these taxa on the Great Barrier Reef requires attention. Spearfishers can provide important information regarding the status of their fishery through direct observations, which can inform legislation when acknowledged."

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the SREBF1c and SREBF2 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with plasma lipids levels and ACS susceptibility in a case-control association study.A case-control study was carried out in 625 patients with ACS (82% men and 18% women, with a mean age of 57.97 ± 10.5 years) and 700 healthy controls (66% men and 34% women, with a mean age of 54.37 ± 7.65 years). The sample size was calculated for a statistical power of 80%. We genotyped three SREBF1c (rs2297508, rs11656665 and rs11868035) and three SREBF2 (rs2267439, rs2267443, and rs2228314) gene polymorphisms by 5' exonuclease TaqMan assays. The associations were evaluated by logistic regression under the co-dominant, dominant, recessive, over-dominant and additive inheritance models. The contribution of the genotypes on the plasma lipids levels was evaluated by Student's t-test.Under different models, the SREBF1c rs2297508 (OR = 1.50, pCRes = 0.03), SREBF1c rs11656665 (OR = 1.35, pCDom = 0.02 and OR = 1.26, pCAdd = 0.02) and SREBF2 rs2228314 (OR = 1.78, pCRes = 0.03, OR = 1.27, pCAdd = 0.04) SNPs were associated with higher risk of ACS. On the other hand, the SREBF1c rs11868035 SNP was associated with lower risk of ACS (OR = 0.49, pCCo-dom = 0.001, OR = 0.66, pCDom = 0.003, OR = 0.57, PRes = 0.003 and OR = 0.71, pCAdd = 0.001). There was a statistically significant association of both SREBF1c rs11656665 and rs11868035 polymorphisms with plasma triglyceride levels.In summary, our data suggest the association of the SREBF1c and SREBF2 SNPs with risk of developing ACS and with triglyceride levels in a Mexican population."
https://openalex.org/W2971721201,"Understanding streamflow in montane watersheds on regional scales is often incomplete due to a lack of data for small-order streams that link precipitation and snowmelt processes to main stem discharge. This data deficiency is attributed to the prohibitive cost of conventional streamflow measurement methods and the remote location of many small streams. Expedient and low-cost streamflow measurement methods used by resource professionals or citizen scientists can provide scientifically useful solutions to this data deficiency. To this end, four current velocity measurement methods were evaluated in a laboratory flume: the surface float, rising body, velocity head rod, and rising air bubble methods. The methods were tested under a range of stream velocities, cross-sectional depths, and streambed substrates. The resulting measurements provide estimates of precision and bias of each method, as well as method-specific insight and calibration formulas. The mean values of the coefficient of variation, a measure of precision, were 10% for the surface float, 10% for the velocity head rod, 14% for the rising body, and 9% for the air bubble method. The values of scaled mean error, a measure of bias, were -8% for the surface float, -4% for the velocity head rod, -1% for the rising body, and 4% for the air bubble. The velocity head rod and surface float methods were the easiest methods to use, providing greater precision at large (> = 0.6 m/s) and small (<0.6 m/s) velocities, respectively. However, the reliance on a velocity ratio for each of these methods can generate inaccuracy in their results. The rising body method is more challenging to execute and of lower precision than the former two methods but provides low bias measurements.

Mutations of Glmn lead to glomuvenous malformations. Glmn has been reported to be associated with FK506-binding proteins (FKBP). Here we present in vitro binding analyses of the FKBP-Glmn interaction. Interestingly, the previously described interaction of Glmn and FKBP12 was found to be comparatively weak. Instead, the closely related FKBP12.6 and FKBP51 emerged as novel binding partners. We show different binding affinities of full length and truncated FKBP51 and FKBP52 mutants. Using FKBP51 as a model system, we show that two amino acids lining the FK506-binding site are essential for binding Glmn and that the FKBP51-Glmn interaction is blocked by FKBP ligands. This data suggest FKBP inhibition as a pharmacological approach to regulate Glmn and Glmn-controlled processes."
https://openalex.org/W2971799937,"African swine fever (ASF) is a haemorrhagic contagious pig disease generally causing high mortality. ASF is enzootic in Madagascar with outbreaks reported each year. An ASF outbreak occurred in May 2015 in the municipality of Imerintsiatosika in Madagascar. We investigated the outbreak to describe it and to identify risk factors in order to propose control measures, and to document evidence of an ASF outbreak in an enzootic country. We took biological samples from very sick and dying pigs, sold by the farmer to the butcher, for PCR analysis. An active search for all possible farm-cases was carried out. A definition of suspected farm-case was established and we implemented a descriptive survey and a retrospective cohort study. Laboratory results confirmed ASF virus infection. Suspected farm-cases represented 81 farms out of 922. Out of 3081 pigs of infected farms, 44% (95% CI: 42-46%) were sick, of which 47% were sold or slaughtered. Case fatality was 60% (95% CI: 56-63%) while 21% (95% CI: 19-24%) of the diseased pigs recovered. The outbreak duration was nine months and half of the infected farms' pig population remained after the outbreak. Compared to the exotic breed, local pigs had twice the risk of infection. It is the first detailed report of an ASF outbreak in an enzootic situation. The disease still has a large impact with 50% animals lost. However, the case fatality is lower than expected that suggests the possibility of resistance and subclinical cases. Proximity to road and increased number of farms are risk factors so biosecurity measures are needed. Further studies are needed to understand why pigs of local breed are more affected. Finally, an acceptable alternative to the sale of sick animals should be found as this currently is the breeders' means to reducing economic loss."
https://openalex.org/W2971848688,"Invasive predators have caused rapid declines in many native prey species across the globe. Predator invasion success may be attributed to prey naïveté, or the absence of anti-predator behavior between native and non-native species. An understanding of the effects of naïveté at different timescales since introduction and across multiple trophic levels is lacking, however, particularly in marine systems. Given the central role of trophic interactions in invasion dynamics, this knowledge gap limits the ability to predict high impact predator invasions. Naïveté was examined across three trophic levels of marine invertebrates: a native basal prey (hard clam), two non-native intermediate predators (the recently-introduced Asian shore crab and the long-established European green crab), a native intermediate predator (juvenile blue crabs), and a native top predator (adult blue crab). We hypothesized that naïveté would be more pronounced in trophic interactions involving the recently-introduced non-native predator in comparison to the long-established non-native and native intermediate predators. We further hypothesized that the recently-introduced intermediate predator would both benefit from naïveté of the native basal prey and be hindered by higher mortality through its own naïveté to the native top predator. To test these hypotheses, three laboratory experiments and a field experiment were used. Consistent with our hypotheses, basal prey naïveté was most pronounced with the recently-introduced intermediate predator, and this increased the predator’s foraging success. This recently-introduced intermediate predator, however, exhibited an ineffective anti-predator response to the native top predator, and was also preyed upon more in the field than its long-established and native counterparts. Therefore, despite direct benefits from basal prey naïveté, the recently-introduced intermediate predator’s naïveté to its own predators may limit its invasion success. These results highlight the importance of a multi-trophic perspective on predator-prey dynamics to more fully understand the consequences of naïveté in invasion biology."
https://openalex.org/W2971570752,"We analyzed data from across five decades of passerine bird banding at Manomet in Plymouth, Massachusetts, USA. This included 172,609 captures during spring migration and 253,265 during fall migration, from 1969 to 2015. Migration counts are prone to large interannual variation and trends are often difficult to interpret, but have the advantage of sampling many breeding populations in a single locale. We employed a Bayesian state-space modeling approach to estimate patterns in abundance over time while accounting for observation error, and a hierarchical clustering method to identify species groups with similar trends over time. Although continent-wide there has been an overall decrease in landbird populations over the past 40 years, we found a variety of patterns in abundance over time. Consistent with other studies, we found an overall decline in numbers of birds in the aggregate, with most species showing significant net declines in migratory cohort size in spring, fall, or both (49/73 species evaluated). Other species, however, exhibited different patterns, including abundance increases (10 species). Even among increasing and declining species, the specific trends varied in shape over time, forming seven distinct clusters in fall and ten in spring. The remaining species followed largely independent and irregular pathways. Overall, life-history traits (dependence on open habitat, nesting on or near the ground, migratory strategy, human commensal, spruce budworm specialists) did a poor job of predicting species groupings of abundance patterns in both spring and fall, but median date of passage was a good predictor of abundance trends during spring (but not fall) migration. This suggests that some species with very similar patterns of abundance were unlikely to be responding to the same environmental forces. Changes in abundance at this banding station were generally consistent with BBS trend data for the same geographic region."
https://openalex.org/W2972223907,"The modelling of HIV trends in Tanzania uses surveillance data from antenatal clinics after adjusting for the reduction in fertility of women living with HIV (WLWH). The rollout of HIV care and treatment services has enabled many WLWH to start on antiretroviral treatment (ART) earlier and are counselled on the options to prevent HIV transmission to their children. The assumption that being HIV positive leads to lower fertility needs to be revisited. This study aims to quantify the effect of ART program expansion on the fertility rate of WLWH in Tanzania. We used Cox regression model to estimate fertility rate and associated factors among WLWH of reproductive age (15-49 years) who enrolled in HIV care and treatment at 57 centers in Tabora from 2008 to 2014. A decomposition of Poisson regression was used to explore the reasons for fertility rate differences observed among WLWH. A total of 6,397 WLWH aged 15-49 years were followed for a median time of 2.0 years. The total fertility rate of 48.8/1,000 person years (95%CI: 44.6 to 52.9/1,000) was inversely proportional to age and WHO clinical staging. WLWH on ART had higher fertility compared to those not started on ART (aHR = 1.5, 95%CI: 1.2-1.9). Being married or cohabiting, having higher CD4 cell count and not using contraceptives were associated with higher fertility rate. The fertility rate after post-ART initiation was 54.95/1,000 and among pre-ART users was 40.52/1,000, a difference of 14.43/1,000 in fertility rate between the groups. In the decomposition analysis, proximate determinants of fertility rate among WLWH on ART accounted for a 93.8% smaller increase than expected. In an era of ART expansion in Tabora region, fertility rates of WLWH increased. Higher fertility rates in women on ART may alter the estimation of HIV prevalence and incidence."
https://openalex.org/W2972299505,"Dextranol, a reduced dextran, prevents damage to stored dry protein samples that unmodified dextran would otherwise cause. Desiccation protectants (xeroprotectants) like the polysaccharide dextran are critical for preserving dried protein samples by forming a rigid glass that protects entrapped protein molecules. Stably dried proteins are important for maintaining critical information in clinical samples like blood serum as well as maintaining activity of biologic drug compounds. However, we found that dextran reacts with both dried serum proteins and lyophilized purified proteins during storage, producing high-molecular weight Amadori-product conjugates. These conjugates appeared in a matter of days or weeks when stored at elevated temperatures (37° or 45°C), but also appeared on a timescale of months when stored at room temperature. We synthesized a less reactive dextranol by reducing dextran’s anomeric carbon from an aldehyde to an alcohol. Serum samples dried in a dextranol-based matrix protected the serum proteins from forming high-molecular weight conjugates. The levels of four cancer-related serum biomarkers (prostate specific antigen, neuropilin-1, osteopontin, and matrix-metalloproteinase 7) decreased, as measured by immunoassay, when serum samples were stored for one to two weeks in dextran-based matrix. Switching to a dextranol-based xeroprotection matrix slightly reduced the damage to osteopontin and completely stopped any detectable damage during storage in the other three biomarkers when stored for a period of two weeks at 45°C. We also found that switching from dextran to dextranol in a lyophilization formulation eliminates this unwanted reaction, even at elevated temperatures. Dextranol offers a small and easy modification to dextran that significantly improves the molecule’s function as a xeroprotectant by eliminating the potential for damaging protein-polysaccharide conjugation."
https://openalex.org/W2971654924,"The preservation of biological samples for an extended time period of days to weeks after initial collection is important for the identification, screening, and characterization of bacterial pathogens. Traditionally, preservation relies on cold-chain infrastructure; however, in many situations this is impractical or not possible. Thus, our goal was to develop alternative bacterial sample preservation and transport media that are effective without refrigeration or external instrumentation. The viability, nucleic acid stability, and protein stability of Bacillus anthracis Sterne 34F2, Francisella novicida U112, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 43300, and Yersinia pestis KIM D27 (pgm-) was assessed for up to 28 days. Xanthan gum (XG) prepared in PBS with L-cysteine maintained more viable F. novicida U112 cells at elevated temperature (40°C) compared to commercial reagents and buffers. Viability was maintained for all four bacteria in XG with 0.9 mM L-cysteine across a temperature range of 22–40°C. Interestingly, increasing the concentration to 9 mM L-cysteine resulted in the rapid death of S. aureus. This could be advantageous when collecting samples in the built environment where there is the potential for Staphylococcus collection and stabilization rather than other organisms of interest. F. novicida and S. aureus DNA were stable for up to 45 days upon storage at 22°C or 40°C, and direct analysis by real-time qPCR, without DNA extraction, was possible in the XG formulations. XG was not compatible with proteomic analysis via LC-MS/MS due to the high amount of residual Xanthomonas campestris proteins present in XG. Our results demonstrate that polysaccharide-based formulations, specifically XG with L-cysteine, maintain bacterial viability and nucleic acid integrity for an array of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria across ambient and elevated temperatures."
https://openalex.org/W2971782240,"The Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), Anoplophora glabripennis, is an invasive wood-borer in North America and Europe that threatens a variety of tree genera, including Acer and Populus. All invasive ALB populations occur in quarantine zones where they are under eradication, a process that is difficult and expensive, requiring extensive surveys and host tree removals. Although ALB has been described as an insect that is typically slow to disperse, some rare individuals that fly longer distances have the potential to start infestations outside of quarantine zones. Biological control using entomopathogenic fungi has been considered as another option for managing ALB infestations. The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum strain F52, registered for commercial use in the United States, is effective at killing ALB adults but information is lacking on how this entomopathogen affects ALB flight behavior before death. Using quarantine-reared ALB, flight mills were used to collect data on flight performance of beetles at multiple time points after infection. Healthy (uninfected) male ALB adults always flew significantly greater distances than females. The maximum observation for total flight distance was a healthy male that flew 10.9 km in 24 hours on a flight mill. ALB adults infected with M. brunneum F52 flew significantly shorter distances compared to healthy adults, starting one week after fungal exposure. Biological control of ALB with this fungal entomopathogen could help to reduce their dispersal in the environment and, thereby, decrease the risk of adults moving outside of quarantine zones."
https://openalex.org/W2971823702,"With the development and universal application of satellite technology, an important way to expand the function of satellites is setting up inter-satellite networks to make them work together. Traditional satellite networking methods generally adopt a fixed time slot allocation method, which is not suitable for small satellite groups with low latency and high throughput requirements. In order to solve this problem, it has been proposed to apply the traditional Wifi protocol in satellite networking. As there are differences between satellite networks and terrestrial networks, it's necessary to improve the traditional 802.11 protocol. The Media Access Control (MAC) protocol in 802.11 is improved in this paper, which mainly includes the adaptive algorithm of maximum contention window size and the growth algorithm of Contention Window (CW) size. The maximum contention window is adjusted according to the conflict state of the current network, which makes the network accommodate more satellite nodes. The CW growth algorithm improves the traditional Binary Exponential Back-off (BEB) algorithm, where the CW is designed according to the priority of the data frame or the network load. In this way, high-priority satellite accusation information will have higher reliability or tolerate greater network load."
https://openalex.org/W2971841287,"Light traps are used to determine the temporal and spatial dynamics of the migratory brown planthoppers (BPHs) Nilaparvata lugens. But very little is known whether newly emerged adults respond to local light traps during the emigration period. Thus, it is important to evaluate the efficiency of light traps in attracting emigrant and immigrant populations to improve forecasting and control of this pest. The migration periods of N. lugens were determined by field surveys in Fuyang, Zhejiang province in 2012 and Yongfu, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 2013. Mark-release-recapture experiments with both newly emerged (unflown) and flight experienced (flown) N. lugens were conducted at the two study sites. The marking method did not have any significant effect on the survival or flight capability of the N. lugens. A total of 4800 marked flown and 8400 unflown BPHs were released at a distance of 10, 20 and 30 m from 45-watt fluorescent actinic light traps. The results showed that without wind (< 3.2 m/s) or rainfall conditions, the overall recapture rate of flown BPHs was higher than that of unflown BPHs (9.60% and 0.92%, respectively; χ21 = 589.66, P < 0.0001). Curve estimation regression analysis showed that flown BPHs were attracted to the light source at a distance of 19.77 m, and unflown BPH at a distance of 5.35 m, with these distances corresponding to a 5% recapture rate. Given that the population dynamics of BPHs in the light traps were not synchronous with that in the fields, our results indicate that only a few emerging BPHs in an infested site can be captured locally by light traps. Therefore, care must be taken in estimating the abundance of the sample to absolute local abundance during sedentary and emigration period."
https://openalex.org/W2971867581,"Cargo containers constitute the most critical component of global trade: 108 million containers represent the movement of about 95% of the world's manufactured goods. The steady increase in cargo container shipments has had a profound effect on world security: the threat associated with smuggling of shielded special nuclear material is elevated every year. Containers reaching the borders of the U.S. are currently not radiographically inspected due to time and dose considerations stemming from the use of bremsstrahlung beams for imaging. Bremsstrahlung spectra are low-energy peaked, resulting in low penetration values, especially through dense cargoes. The use of monoenergetic radiography beams could alleviate many of these problems due to higher energy and low background continuum. Using Monte Carlo simulations of a realistic imaging scenario with support from previous experimental measurements, we demonstrate how the use of monoenergetic photon beams in radiography can simultaneously reduce the radiation dose imparted to the cargo and any potential stowaways while increasing image quality. Dual-energy methods are leveraged to calculate material atomic number. Image quality is evaluated by measuring the noise standard deviation, contrast-to-noise ratio, and the pixel error as the dose is decreased."
