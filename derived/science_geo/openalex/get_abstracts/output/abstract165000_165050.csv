https://openalex.org/W1974572323,"We used event-related fMRI to assess whether brain responses to fearful versus neutral faces are modulated by spatial attention. Subjects performed a demanding matching task for pairs of stimuli at prespecified locations, in the presence of task-irrelevant stimuli at other locations. Faces or houses unpredictably appeared at the relevant or irrelevant locations, while the faces had either fearful or neutral expressions. Activation of fusiform gyri by faces was strongly affected by attentional condition, but the left amygdala response to fearful faces was not. Right fusiform activity was greater for fearful than neutral faces, independently of the attention effect on this region. These results reveal differential influences on face processing from attention and emotion, with the amygdala response to threat-related expressions unaffected by a manipulation of attention that strongly modulates the fusiform response to faces."

Cu and Zn are enriched in Abeta deposits in AD, which are solubilized by Cu/Zn-selective chelators in vitro. Here we report a 49% decrease in brain Abeta deposition (-375 microg/g wet weight, p = 0.0001) in a blinded study of APP2576 transgenic mice treated orally for 9 weeks with clioquinol, an antibiotic and bioavailable Cu/Zn chelator. This was accompanied by a modest increase in soluble Abeta (1.45% of total cerebral Abeta); APP, synaptophysin, and GFAP levels were unaffected. General health and body weight parameters were significantly more stable in the treated animals. These results support targeting the interactions of Cu and Zn with Abeta as a novel therapy for the prevention and treatment of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2076344205,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive accumulation in selected neurons of protein inclusions containing alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin. Rare inherited forms of PD are caused by autosomal dominant mutations in alpha-synuclein or by autosomal recessive mutations in parkin, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We hypothesized that these two gene products interact functionally, namely, that parkin ubiquitinates alpha-synuclein normally and that this process is altered in autosomal recessive PD. We have now identified a protein complex in normal human brain that includes parkin as the E3 ubiquitin ligase, UbcH7 as its associated E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, and a new 22-kilodalton glycosylated form of alpha-synuclein (alphaSp22) as its substrate. In contrast to normal parkin, mutant parkin associated with autosomal recessive PD failed to bind alphaSp22. In an in vitro ubiquitination assay, alphaSp22 was modified by normal but not mutant parkin into polyubiquitinated, high molecular weight species. Accordingly, alphaSp22 accumulated in a non-ubiquitinated form in parkin-deficient PD brains. We conclude that alphaSp22 is a substrate for parkin's ubiquitin ligase activity in normal human brain and that loss of parkin function causes pathological alphaSp22 accumulation. These findings demonstrate a critical biochemical reaction between the two PD-linked gene products and suggest that this reaction underlies the accumulation of ubiquitinated alpha-synuclein in conventional PD."

The morphology of such composites depends not only on the characteristics of the copolymers, but also on the features of the nanoparticles. To explore this vast parameter space and predict the mesophases of the hybrids, we have developed a mean field theory for mixtures of soft, flexible chains and hard spheres. Applied to diblock-nanoparticle mixtures, the theory predicts ordered phases where particles and diblocks self-assemble into spatially periodic structures. The method can be applied to other copolymer-particle mixtures and can be used to design novel composite architectures."

Flavopiridol is the most potent P-TEFb inhibitor reported and the first Cdk inhibitor that is not competitive with ATP. We examined the ability of flavopiridol to inhibit P-TEFb (Cdk9/cyclin T1) phosphorylation of both RNA polymerase II and the large subunit of the 5, 6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) sensitivity-inducing factor and found that the IC50determined was directly related to the concentration of the enzyme. We concluded that the flavonoid associates with P-TEFb with 1:1 stoichiometry even at concentrations of enzyme in the low nanomolar range. These results indicate that the apparent lack of competition with ATP could be caused by a very tight binding of the drug. We developed a novel immobilized P-TEFb assay and demonstrated that the drug remains bound for minutes even in the presence of high salt. Flavopiridol remained bound in the presence of a 1000-fold excess of the commonly used inhibitor DRB, suggesting that the immobilized P-TEFb could be used in a simple screening assay that would allow the discovery or characterization of compounds with binding properties similar to flavopiridol. Finally, we compared the ability of flavopiridol and DRB to inhibit transcription in vivo using nuclear run-on assays and concluded that P-TEFb is required for transcription of most RNA polymerase II molecules in vivo.

Our previous data demonstrates that flavopiridol specifically blocked the elongation phase of transcription through the inhibition of P-TEFb and was the most potent P-TEFb inhibitor with a K i of 3 nm (8Chao S.H.

One study used a combination ofin vitro and in vivo assays to screen more than 100,000 compounds for the inhibitors of HIV Tat transcriptional activation. All the compounds identified, including DRB, were found to inhibit P-TEFb (IC50 values between 0.2 and 5 µm in vitro; IC50 values between 1 and 9.5 µm in cell culture), strongly suggesting that P-TEFb represents an attractive target for HIV therapeutics (20Mancebo H.S.

Consistent with its ability to inhibit P-TEFb, flavopiridol blocked Tat transactivation in vitro and HIV-1 replication in both single-round and viral spread assays with an IC50 of less than 10 nm (8Chao S.H. Fujinaga K. Marion J.E. Taube R. Sausville E.A. Senderowicz A.M. Peterlin B.M. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28345-28348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Unlike the current anti-HIV drugs that target the viral proteins and result in the selection and propagation of resistant strains, flavopiridol specifically inhibits a cellular factor, P-TEFb. Therefore, it is unlikely that resistant viral strains will arise under the treatment of flavopiridol. However, toxicity of flavopiridol is a concern because it affects normal cellular transcription. Clinical study indicates that the maximal tolerated dose of flavopiridol in cancer patients is between 200 and 400 nm, which results in diarrhea and a proinflammatory syndrome (22Senderowicz A.M. Headlee D. Stinson S.F. Lush R.M. Kalil N. Villalba L. Hill K. Steinberg S.M. Figg W.D. Tompkins A. Arbuck S.G. Sausville E.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 16: 2986-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Our early results suggested that flavopiridol might be effective against HIV (8Chao S.H. Fujinaga K. Marion J.E. Taube R. Sausville E.A. Senderowicz A.M. Peterlin B.M. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28345-28348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Because lower doses (10–20 nm) might alleviate serious side effects, flavopiridol should be evaluated as a potential HIV therapeutic agent. One of the important issues that needs to be resolved is how the drug specifically inhibits P-TEFb and why it is much more potent than any previously identified P-TEFb inhibitors. Here we show a 1:1 association between P-TEFb and flavopiridol. Utilizing a newly developed immobilized P-TEFb assay, we demonstrate much tighter binding of flavopiridol compared with DRB and the possible usage of the immobilized P-TEFb assay to characterize or screen for compounds with properties similar to flavopiridol. A second important issue is the effect of flavopiridol on normal cellular transcription. Nuclear run-on assays were performed to determine the extent of inhibition of RNA polymerase II in vivo at flavopiridol concentrations that ranged from those likely to be effective against HIV up to those used in chemotherapy. [γ-32P]ATP (>5000 Ci/mmol) and ribonucleoside triphosphates were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Flavopiridol (Aventis Inc.) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) to 10 mm and stored at −80 °C. DRB (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol to 10 mm and stored at −80 °C. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Recombinant human P-TEFb protein, comprised of cyclin T1 and His-tagged Cdk9, was expressed using a baculovirus expression system and purified as described previously (12Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 755-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). To biotinylate P-TEFb, 10 µg of P-TEFb was incubated with 2 µg of biotin N-hydroxysuccinimide ester-water soluble (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) in 100 mm HEPES, pH 8.5 for 1–2 h at room temperature, followed by adding 15 µg of glycine to stop the biotinylation reaction. The protein mixture was loaded onto an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) to separate the biotin-labeled P-TEFb and the free biotin reagent. After elution with 200 mm imidazole-containing buffer, the biotin-P-TEFb was mixed with M-280 streptavidin paramagnetic beads (Dynal Biotech) at 4 °C for 1 h. A magnetic concentrator (Dynal Biotech) was utilized to isolate and concentrate the immobilized P-TEFb. Kinase assays were as described in Chaoet al. (8Chao S.H. Fujinaga K. Marion J.E. Taube R.

The production and purification of recombinant DSIF is described. 2D. Renner, Y. Yamaguchi, T. Wada, H. Handa, and D. Price, submitted for publication. Flavopiridol and DRB were serially diluted in 4% Me2SO and 16% ethanol, respectively, to give the indicated concentrations. The final concentration of Me2SO and ethanol in kinase assays was less than 1 and 4%, respectively. The drugs were incubated with soluble or immobilized P-TEFb at 30 °C for 10 min. In immobilized P-TEFb assays, the concentrations of the two drugs (90 µmDRB or 400 nm flavopiridol) were more than 10-fold greater than their IC50 values. After concentrating the beads and removing the unbound drugs, the immobilized P-TEFb was quickly washed twice with HGKE buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 15% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, with the indicated concentrations of KCl). In both soluble and immobilized P-TEFb assays, subsequent phosphorylation reaction times were 10 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The extent of phosphorylation was quantitated from dried gels using a Packard InstantImager. The IC50 values were calculated by fitting the data to a logistic dose-response curve using the program TableCurve (Jandel Scientific). Suspension HeLa cells were grown to the density of 4 × 105 cells/ml and then treated with the indicated amounts of flavopiridol or DRB for 1 h. All of the following operations were performed at 4 °C. 500 ml of cells were harvested by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min and then resuspended in 5 ml of Buffer A (0.32 m sucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm Mg(Ac)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The cells were broken using a Dounce homogenizer. Cell lysis was monitored by phase-contrast microscopy. The homogenate was diluted with 2 volumes of the sucrose cushion (1.9 msucrose, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmMg(Ac)2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), giving a final sucrose concentration of 1.3 m, and then layered over the sucrose cushion. The homogenate was centrifuged for 45 min at 22,000 × g. After carefully removing the sucrose solution, the white-colored nuclei were suspended in storage buffer (25% glycerol, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mmMg(Ac)2, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) at about 5 × 108 nuclei/ml at −80 °C. Transcription reactions were carried out as described previously (23Reeder R.H. Roeder R.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 67: 433-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Each 200-µl reaction contained 1 × 107 nuclei from either treated or untreated cells. Reactions were carried out in 0.12 mKCl, 7 mm Mg(Ac)2, 25 µCi of [32P]GTP, 500 µm ATP, UTP, and CTP with or without 2 µg/ml α-amanitin. Temperature was maintained at 30 °C and duplicated timepoints (18 µl/point) were stopped at 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min by the addition of 57 µl of Sarkosyl solution (1% Sarkosyl, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 200 µg/ml tRNA). The stopped reactions were transferred onto Whatman DE81 paper, and the paper was washed four times with wash buffer (5% K2HPO4 and 0.3% Na4P2O7) for 10 min, followed by a 5-min water wash. Then the paper was briefly rinsed with 95% ethanol and allowed to dry completely. Radiation was quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac). We have shown that flavopiridol is the most potent inhibitor of P-TEFb identified thus far and is able to block HIV transcription and replication efficiently (8Chao S.H. Fujinaga K. Marion J.E. Taube R. Sausville E.A. Senderowicz A.M. Peterlin B.M. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28345-28348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Because our data suggested that flavopiridol should be evaluated as a potential HIV therapy, it was important to investigate the inhibitory mechanism of the drug on P-TEFb in detail. We calculated the amount of P-TEFb present in the previously published kinase reactions (8Chao S.H. Fujinaga K. Marion J.E. Taube R. Sausville E.A. Senderowicz A.M. Peterlin B.M. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28345-28348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) and were surprised to find that the concentration of P-TEFb was very close to the IC50 values determined. Based on this observation, we decided to carry out flavopiridol inhibition studies in a series of reactions that contained different concentrations of the enzyme. If flavopiridol binding was very tight, lower concentrations of P-TEFb might result in lower IC50 values. We first performed kinase assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of flavopiridol and a constant amount ofDrosophila RNA polymerase II as substrate. P-TEFb is able to phosphorylate up to 100 different sites in the carboxyl-terminal domain of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. Four different levels of P-TEFb (1×, 5×, 10×, and 25×) were used in these assays with 1× P-TEFb about 4 nm. The amount of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP incorporated into the large subunit of RNA polymerase II increased as the amount of P-TEFb increased (Fig.1A). Note that the autoradiographs chosen for Fig. 1 A do not necessarily represent equal exposure times. Flavopiridol inhibited phosphorylation at all concentrations of P-TEFb tested (Fig. 1). However, inhibition of kinase activity occurred at lower concentrations of flavopiridol when low levels of P-TEFb were used (Fig. 1 B). To determine whether the unusual dependence of the IC50 on the concentration of P-TEFb was attributed to the large number of phosphorylation sites present in the carboxyl-terminal domain, an identical experiment was carried out using DSIF as substrate. Only a few serine/threonine residues in the carboxyl-terminal region of the large subunit of DSIF are phosphorylated by P-TEFb (24Kim J.B. Sharp P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12317-12323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 276: 12951-12958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Fig.2shows that the phosphorylation of DSIF was similar to that with RNA polymerase II. Phosphorylation increased with increasing P-TEFb, indicating that the substrate was not limiting (data not shown). As found with RNA polymerase II, flavopiridol was able to inhibit phosphorylation of DSIF more easily when less P-TEFb was used (Fig. 2). It is clear from the plot of the percent of activity remaining at each flavopiridol concentration that the 50% inhibition points increased as the amount of P-TEFb increased (Fig.2 B). These data indicate that the unusual inhibitory properties of flavopiridol on P-TEFb are substrate-independent. The fact that the amount of flavopiridol needed to inhibit P-TEFb changed with the amount of P-TEFb used suggested that flavopiridol might be acting stoichiometrically with the kinase. The concentration of the purified recombinant P-TEFb was estimated using absorbance at 280 nm and an extinction coefficient calculated from the composition of the protein. IC50 values were determined at each concentration of P-TEFb used in the experiments in Figs. 1 and 2. For each flavopiridol titration the IC50 value calculated was roughly half of the concentration of P-TEFb. This striking result was visualized by plotting IC50 versus the amount of P-TEFb (Fig. 3). An average of the two sets of data described a straight line with an intercept at 0.9 nm and a slope of 0.4. A comparison of IC50 to half of the concentration of P-TEFb, giving the IC50, indicates that at the concentrations tested, one molecule of flavopiridol inhibited [1/(2 × 0.4)] or 1.25 molecules of P-TEFb. It is possible that our calculation of the concentration of P-TEFb was off by 25%, because part of the calculation was an estimation of the percent purity of the preparation. Because of this possible error and because it is unlikely that flavopiridol could inhibit P-TEFb at less than a 1:1 molar ratio, we tentatively conclude that there is stoichiometric binding of the drug to P-TEFb. Because binding is 1:1 even at 4 nm P-TEFb, it is likely that flavopiridol has a subnanomolar dissociation constant. As a control similar assays to those in Figs. 1 and 2 were carried out using DRB as the kinase inhibitor, and the tight correlation between the drug and the enzyme concentration was not observed (data not shown). To study the unique binding of flavopiridol and to examine the inhibitory properties of flavopiridol and DRB in greater detail, we developed an immobilized P-TEFb assay. This assay allowed us to investigate how tightly the drug binds to P-TEFb by rapidly washing the drug-P-TEFb complexes multiple times without losing significant amounts of P-TEFb. The protocol used to generate immobilized P-TEFb is summarized in Fig. 4A. First, the His-tagged recombinant P-TEFb was biotinylated through a covalent interaction between a water-soluble biotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and at least one of the lysine residues in the protein. There are 29 and 52 lysine residues present in Cdk9 and cyclin T1, respectively. The biotinylation process resulted in a loss of about 70% of the kinase activity of P-TEFb (Fig.4 B). However, it is not clear whether the loss was due to inactivation specifically by biotinylation of critical residues or nonspecifically because of the conditions of the reaction. The biotinylated P-TEFb was then repurified using an Ni2+column to remove the free biotin reagent. This step resulted in a loss of 90% of the kinase activity (Fig. 4 B). This was probably due to nonspecific association of the small amount of protein to the resin or tubes, because no kinase activity was detected in the flow-through of the Ni2+ column (Fig. 4 B). The purified biotin-P-TEFb was then bound to streptavidin-conjugated paramagnetic beads. Most of the P-TEFb bound to the beads (Fig.4 B). Taking into account losses at all steps, about 5% of the original enzymatic activity was recovered immobilized to the beads. Such a loss of activity was expected because of the numerous steps involved, the chemical modification of the enzyme, and the immobilization that would limit diffusion of the enzyme in the kinase assay. Although the loss of kinase activity was significant, the final preparation was able to easily generate a strong signal in the kinase assay. To investigate the difference between DRB and flavopiridol association with P-TEFb, immobilized P-TEFb was incubated with DRB or flavopiridol individually for 10 min. The concentrations of DRB and flavopiridol utilized were more than 10-fold greater than their IC50values on P-TEFb (Fig. 5A). After isolating the kinase and removing the unbound drugs using a magnetic concentrator, immobilized P-TEFb was washed twice with a low salt buffer (30 mm KCl). If the drugs were not bound to P-TEFb tightly, the washing steps would cause a 1:40,000 dilution, and the resulting concentrations of the drugs would not be able to inhibit the activity of P-TEFb. As shown in Fig. 5 A, washing allowed the recovery of activity from DRB-treated P-TEFb. However, only 20% of the activity was recovered from flavopiridol-treated P-TEFb (Fig.5 A). Similar results (data not shown) were obtained even when the beads were washed up to four times (200-fold dilution each time). Clearly, flavopiridol is very tightly bound to P-TEFb. We then investigated the effects of ionic strength on drug binding. The drug-treated immobilized kinases were washed twice with buffer containing different concentrations of KCl (0, 30, 100, or 300 mm). All of the kinase activity was recovered from DRB-treated beads regardless of the salt concentration (Fig.5 B), indicating that the weak interaction between DRB and P-TEFb is not stabilized by salt. Activity was not recovered from flavopiridol-treated beads at any of the salt concentrations tested (Fig. 5 B). This suggests that the strong interaction between flavopiridol and P-TEFb may be mediated by hydrophobic contacts. It occurred to us that it might be possible to select compounds that bound tightly to P-TEFb from a mixture of compounds. This would be useful in screening for strong P-TEFb inhibitors by looking for mixtures that resulted in inhibition of the kinase activity of immobilized P-TEFb after washing and then identifying the strong binding component. One potential problem is that a given mixture might contain a number of weak P-TEFb inhibitors that would compete with the strong inhibitor binding. To examine the practicality of detecting a tightly binding compound such as flavopiridol in the presence of other potentially competing compounds, we investigated whether DRB would inhibit flavopiridol binding to immobilized P-TEFb. We have already shown that DRB could be removed from immobilized P-TEFb with several washing steps (Fig. 5), but it was possible that it might compete with flavopiridol during the binding step, especially if it were present in a large excess. As expected, incubation of 400 nm flavopiridol with immobilized P-TEFb inhibited the kinase activity after two wash steps (Fig. 6A). Incubation with up to 400 µm DRB alone did not significantly inhibit P-TEFb after two wash steps. When 400 nm flavopiridol was included in the incubation with the same increasing amounts of DRB, P-TEFb activity after the two wash steps was inhibited to the same extent as when flavopiridol was in the incubation alone. This indicates that DRB does not significantly compete with flavopiridol for binding to P-TEFb even when present in a 1000-fold excess (Fig. 6 B). One important aspect of the evaluation of flavopiridol as an HIV therapy is the determination of its effect on normal cellular transcription. To address this issue and to demonstrate that the effects seen are caused by inhibition of P-TEFb, we performed nuclear run-on assays using nuclei isolated from HeLa cells treated with different amounts of either flavopiridol or DRB. The effect of flavopiridol could be determined directly, and the idea that P-TEFb was the target was strengthened by the use of two different P-TEFb inhibitors that had IC50 values against P-TEFb that differed by about three orders of magnitude. Both compounds have been shown to inhibit P-TEFb more effectively than any other cyclin-dependent kinases. Nuclear run-on assays were chosen over techniques using DNA microarrays because the readout from nuclear run-on assays is direct and minimizes secondary effects such as mRNA stability and indirect effects caused by inhibition of genes whose products regulate transcription of other genes. The cells were treated with the P-TEFb inhibitors for only 1 h before the nuclei were isolated. P-TEFb controls the transition into productive elongation of complexes that are blocked shortly after initiation by the action of negative elongation factors. If P-TEFb is inhibited shortly after the addition of the compound, RNA polymerase II molecules that initiate after the addition of the compound would not be able to make the transition and should exhibit decreased incorporation of radioisotope into RNA. However, polymerases that made the transition into productive elongation before the drug was added would be able to continue to carry out elongation even in the presence of the inhibitor (26Egyhazi E. Ossoinak A. Pigon A. Holmgren C. Lee J.M. Greenleaf A.L. Chromosoma. 1996; 104: 422-433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 1-h treatment used would be effective for inhibiting all transcription from genes whose lengths are less than about 90,000 base pairs because the transcription ratein vivo is about 1500 nucleotides/min. Longer genes would still have elongating polymerases even after 1 h. Longer incubation times could have been chosen, but we wanted to minimize secondary effects. After 1 h of inhibition, mRNA levels should not have changed, thereby reducing the possibility of altering protein levels that might affect transcription. Nuclei were isolated from HeLa cells treated with mock drug or different levels of either flavopiridol or DRB for 1 h and then subjected to the nuclear run-on procedure. Reactions were performed either in the absence or presence of 2 µg/ml α-amanitin to inhibit RNA polymerase II directly. Each experiment compared nuclei obtained from control cells to identical cells treated with the P-TEFb inhibitor. In all control experiments, 70–80% of the total counts incorporated were sensitive to α-amanitin, indicating t"

https://openalex.org/W2049279317,"Mutation of the zebrafish lakritz (lak) locus completely eliminates the earliest-born retinal cells, the ganglion cells (RGCs). Instead, excess amacrine, bipolar, and Müller glial cells are generated in the mutant. The extra amacrines are found at ectopic locations in the ganglion cell layer. Cone photoreceptors appear unaffected by the mutation. Molecular analysis reveals that lak encodes Ath5, the zebrafish eye-specific ortholog of the Drosophila basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Atonal. A combined birth-dating and cell marker analysis demonstrates that lak/ath5 is essential for RGC determination during the first wave of neurogenesis in the retina. Our results suggest that this wave is skipped in the mutant, leading to an accumulation of progenitors for inner nuclear layer cells."

Under a wide range of stimuli, cells in the retina and thalamus fire spikes very reproducibly, often with millisecond precision on subsequent stimulus repeats. Here we develop a mathematical description of the firing process that, given the recent visual input, accurately predicts the timing of individual spikes. The formalism is successful in matching the spike trains from retinal ganglion cells in salamander, rabbit, and cat, as well as from lateral geniculate nucleus neurons in cat. It adapts to many different response types, from very precise to highly variable. The accuracy of the model allows a compact description of how these neurons encode the visual stimulus."

The cellular origin and mechanism of directional selectivity were investigated by selectively eliminating retinal starburst amacrine cells, using immunotoxin-mediated cell targeting techniques. Starburst cell ablation in the adult retina abolished not only directional selectivity of ganglion cell responses but also an optokinetic eye reflex derived by stimulus movement. Starburst cells therefore serve as the key element that discriminates the direction of stimulus movement through integrative synaptic transmission and play a pivotal role in information processing that stabilizes image motion."

We used gene therapy to ascertain where DA replacement in the brain restores feeding and other behaviors in DD mice. Restoration of DA production within the caudate putamen restores feeding on regular chow and nest-building behavior, whereas restoration of DA production in the nucleus accumbens restores exploratory behavior. Replacement of DA to either region restores preference for sucrose or a palatable diet without fully rescuing coordination or initiation of movement. These data suggest that a fundamental difference exists between feeding for sustenance and the ability to prefer rewarding substances."

These borocarbon units contribute two, one, and zero electrons, respectively, to the parent pi system. Depending on the choice of these units, the hyparenes (judging from computed proton and nucleus-independent chemical shifts), can maintain or can interconvert the aromatic or antiaromatic character of the parent compounds. The hyparenes are low-lying local minima with normal carbon-boron, boron-boron, and carbon-carbon bond lengths. The multicenter bonding in the hyparenes involves contributions of partial sigma and partial pi bonds to the planar pentacoordinate carbons; the octet rule is not violated. Borocarbon species, for which there is some mass spectrometric evidence, might be observed and identified, for example, in matrix isolation by vibrational spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2053909281,"Homeostatic mechanisms regulate synaptic function to maintain nerve and muscle excitation within reasonable physiological limits. The mechanisms that initiate homeostasic changes to synaptic function are not known. We specifically impaired cellular depolarization by expressing the Kir2.1 potassium channel in Drosophila muscle. In Kir2.1-expressing muscle there is a persistent outward potassium current ( approximately 10 nA), decreased muscle input resistance (50-fold), and a hyperpolarized resting potential. Despite impaired muscle excitability, synaptic depolarization of muscle achieves wild-type levels. A quantal analysis demonstrates that increased presynaptic release (quantal content), without a change in quantal size (mEPSC amplitude), compensates for altered muscle excitation. Because morphological synaptic growth is normal, we conclude that a homeostatic increase in presynaptic release compensates for impaired muscle excitability. These data demonstrate that a monitor of muscle membrane depolarization is sufficient to initiate synaptic homeostatic compensation."
https://openalex.org/W1986939620,"We have used a mRNA differential display technique to identify new genes involved in the reprogramming of gene expression during the adipose conversion of mouse 3T3 preadipocyte cell lines. We report here on the identification and cloning of a novel adipose-specific cDNA encoding a predicted membrane protein of 413 amino acids. The level of the corresponding 3.2-kilobase mRNA is tremendously increased during 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A differentiation into adipocytes. A single, very abundant 3.2-kilobase transcript is also found in inguinal and epididymal white adipose tissues and in interscapular brown adipose tissue but not in any other tissues examined. Its expression in adipose tissue is under tight nutritional regulation. The level of this novel 3.2-kilobase transcript becomes virtually nondetectable during fasting but is dramatically increased when fasted mice are refed a high carbohydrate diet. Based on its adipose specificity and dietary regulation, the novel gene product has been designated adiponutrin. The expression of adiponutrin mRNA is also 50-fold elevated in genetically obese fa/fa rats, indicating a link between adiponutrin and obesity. Western blot and confocal imagery analyses with epitope-tagged protein transiently expressed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and COS cells show that adiponutrin strictly localizes to membranes and is absent from the cytosol. Sequence analysis reveals homologies with several other members of related eukaryotic proteins, including a human paralog, which has been recently described in vesicular transport mechanisms. This leads us to suggest that adiponutrin could be involved in vesicular targeting and protein transport restricted to the adipocyte function."

In four functional neuroimaging experiments, we show recruitment of early visual cortex (V1/V2) when cochlear implant users listen to sounds with eyes closed.

https://openalex.org/W2087579842,"Dystroglycan-dystrophin complexes are believed to have structural and signaling functions by linking extracellular matrix proteins to the cytoskeleton and cortical signaling molecules. Here we characterize a dystroglycan-dystrophin-related protein 2 (DRP2) complex at the surface of myelin-forming Schwann cells. The complex is clustered by the interaction of DRP2 with L-periaxin, a homodimeric PDZ domain-containing protein. In the absence of L-periaxin, DRP2 is mislocalized and depleted, although other dystrophin family proteins are unaffected. Disruption of the DRP2-dystroglycan complex is followed by hypermyelination and destabilization of the Schwann cell-axon unit in Prx(-/-) mice. Hence, the DRP2-dystroglycan complex likely has a distinct function in the terminal stages of PNS myelinogenesis, possibly in the regulation of myelin thickness."

Robust circadian changes in DBT subcellular localization are nevertheless observed in clock-containing cells of the fly head. These localization rhythms accompany formation of protein complexes that include PER, TIM, and DBT, and reflect periodic redistribution between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Nuclear phosphorylation of PER is strongly enhanced when TIM is removed from PER/TIM/DBT complexes. The varying associations of PER, DBT and TIM appear to determine the onset and duration of nuclear PER function within the Drosophila clock."

We found that intersubunit disulfide bonds form spontaneously between S399C residues in the helix bundle when channels are in the closed but not in the open state. While MTSET modification of pore-lining residues was state dependent, Ag+ modification of V391C, in the inner vestibule, occurred at the same diffusion-limited rate in both open and closed states.

It is autocatalytically released from the precursors pp1a and pp1ab byone zinc finger-containing papain-like protease (PLpro) in IBV and by two paralogous PLpros, PL1pro and PL2pro, in mouse hepatitis virus. The PLpro-containing proteins have been recently implicated in the control of coronavirus subgenomic mRNA synthesis (transcription). By using comparative sequence analysis, we now show that the respective proteins of all sequenced coronaviruses are flanked by two conserved PLpro cleavage sites and share a complex (multi)domain organization with PL1pro being inactivated in IBV. Based upon these predictions, the processing of the human coronavirus 229E p195/p210 N terminus was studied in detail. First, an 87-kDa protein (p87), which is derived from a pp1a/pp1ab region immediately upstream of p195/p210, was identified in human coronavirus 229E-infected cells. Second, in vitro synthesized proteins representing different parts of pp1a were autocatalytically processed at the predicted site. Surprisingly, both PL1pro and PL2pro cleaved between p87 and p195/p210. The PL1pro-mediated cleavage was slow and significantly suppressed by a non-proteolytic activity of PL2pro. In contrast, PL2pro, whose proteolytic activity and specificity were established in this study, cleaved the same site efficiently in the presence of the upstream domains. Third, a correlation was observed between the overlapping substrate specificities and the parallel evolution of PL1pro and PL2pro. Collectively, our results imply that the p195/p210 autoprocessing mechanisms may be conserved among coronaviruses to an extent not appreciated previously, with PL2pro playing a major role.

The virion RNA enters ribosomes and directs the synthesis of one or two multidomain protein precursors (polyproteins) that, in a controlled fashion, are proteolytically processed by viral and, sometimes, cellular proteases to produce intermediate and mature products. This processing proceeds in cis and in trans at interdomain junctions that contain the specific signals recognized by proteases (1Kräusslich H.G. Wimmer E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 701-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 2Dougherty W.G. Semler B.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 781-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J.

We have been studying the protease-mediated regulation of viral gene expression using human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV),1 which belongs to theCoronaviridae family. Based on a similar polycistronic genome organization, common transcriptional and (post)-translational strategies, and a conserved array of nonstructural domains, theCoronaviridae have been united with theArteriviridae in the order Nidovirales (Fig.1A) (4den Boon J.A.

With genome sizes of up to 32 kilobases, coronaviruses have the largest genomes among RNA viruses, whereas the related arteriviruses are much smaller (13–16 kilobases). The positive-stranded genomic RNA of nidoviruses contains 5′- and 3′-nontranslated regions as well as 6–12 ORFs that, in some cases, partially overlap each other. One of the most striking features of the nidovirus life cycle is the specific mode of genome transcription, which results in the synthesis of a 3′-coterminal, nested set of 4–8 sg mRNAs. Except for the smallest transcript, these sg mRNAs are structurally polycistronic (Fig. 1 A), but generally, only the most 5′-proximal ORF is translated (reviewed in Ref. 6Lai M.M.C. Cavanagh D. Adv. Virus Res. 1997; 48: 1-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two largest ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b), which encompass the 5′-proximal two-thirds of the genome, are believed to encode all the protein functions required for nidovirus RNA synthesis (7Molenkamp R. van Tol H.

RNA. 2000; 6: 1056-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), is only produced if a ribosomal frameshift from ORF1a into ORF1b takes place during translation (11Brierley I. Boursnell M.E. Binns M.M. Bilimoria B. Blok V.C. Brown T.D. Inglis S.C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3779-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). This translational strategy is expected to yield two extremely large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, of about 450 and 750 kDa, respectively. To date, pp1a and pp1ab have not been detected in vivo, most probably because they are cotranslationally and autocatalytically processed into numerous processing intermediates and mature nonstructural proteins. Both the number and the origin of most of these proteins remain to be determined for coronaviruses (reviewed in Ref. 12Ziebuhr J. Snijder E.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The coronavirus pp1ab can be divided into an N-terminal region that is processed by one or two accessory papain-like proteases (Fig.1 B) and a C-terminal region that is processed by the main 3C-like cysteine protease (3CLpro) (12Ziebuhr J. Snijder E.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 853-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of pp1a/pp1ab spans from the initiator Met to the N terminus of the 3CLpro and consists of ∼2800–3300 amino acids (Fig. 1 B). Although IBV contains only one papain-like protease (PLpro), which is preceded by a conserved X domain, all other coronaviruses encode two paralogous and sequentially positioned papain-like proteases (PL1pro and PL2pro) that flank the X domain from both sides (13Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Lai M.M.C. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 14Lee H.J. Shieh C.K. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. La Monica N. Tuler J. Bagdzhadzhyan A. Lai M.M. Virology. 1991; 180: 567-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The IBV PLpro is part of an ∼1550-amino acid protein (p195) that is autocatalytically released at flanking sites (15Lim K.P.

Cleavage at the N terminus of p195 produces p87, which is the N-terminal processing product of the IBV pp1a/pp1ab. In contrast, at least three proteins, p28, p65, and p210 (also known as p240), are produced from this region of pp1a/pp1ab in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (17Denison M. Perlman S.

Virol. 1995; 69: 809-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Irrespective of the virus studied, the position in pp1a and the protease identity, all established and predicted coronavirus PLpro/PL1pro cleavage sites, contain a small amino acid (commonly Gly) at the P1 or P1′ position, or at both positions. Technically, coronavirus PLpros have only been characterized in surrogate systems, since the extreme size of the coronavirus RNA genome proved to be a serious obstacle to the development of straightforward reverse genetic approaches (28Almazan F. González J.M. Pénzes Z. Izeta A. Calvo E. Plana-Durán J. Enjuanes L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5516-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 29Yount B. Curtis K.M.

Virol. 2001; 82: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In most cases, the in vitro results have been corroborated by the identification of corresponding cleavage products in coronavirus-infected cells, and thus, they are biologically relevant. Although the function of the N-terminal region of pp1a/pp1ab is not known, both the transcription-negative phenotype of an alphavirus X domain mutant (31LaStarza M.W. Lemm J.A. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5781-5791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the conservation of a transcription factor-like zinc finger in coronavirus PLpros (32Herold J. Siddell S.G. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14918-14925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) indicated that p195/p210 might be involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis. This hypothesis is strongly supported by a recent report in which the equine arteritis virus nonstructural protein 1, which, most probably, is a distant homolog of the coronavirus PLpros, is shown to be a transcriptional factor that is indispensable for sg mRNA synthesis (33Tijms M.A. van Dinten L.C. Gorbalenya A.E. Snijder E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1889-1894Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the mechanism of the coronavirus p195/p210 processing. We updated our previous alignment for the poorly conserved p195/p210 region (14Lee H.J. Shieh C.K. Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. La Monica N. Tuler J. Bagdzhadzhyan A. Lai M.M. Virology. 1991; 180: 567-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and found that p195/p210 (i) has a uniform domain organization and (ii) is flanked by cleavage sites that are conserved in all coronaviruses, including IBV. Contrary to the current belief that IBV encodes only one PLpro, we show here that IBV, like other coronaviruses, may in fact encode two PLpro domains as follows: a proteolytically defective remnant of PL1pro and an active PL2pro, currently known as PLpro. We then confirmed the identity of the N-terminal site in HCoV and demonstrated this site to be cleaved by either of the two PLpros, indicating that these proteases may be (partly) redundant. The ability of PL1pro to cleave the cognate site was found to be considerably down-regulated by flanking sequences that included PL2pro. In contrast, PL2pro cleaved the same site more efficiently in the presence of the upstream sequences. The combined data suggest that the regulation of coronavirus genome expression may include a unique autoproteolytic mechanism that recruits two paralogous proteases to cleave the same site. Amino acid sequences were derived from the Genpeptides data base. Sequence alignments were produced using the ClustalX program (34Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35590) Google Scholar), the Dialign2 program (35Morgenstern B. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), and the Macaw workbench (36Schuler G.D. Altschul S.F. Lipman D.J. Proteins. 1991; 9: 180-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Non-redundant sequence data bases were searched with single sequences (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60145) Google Scholar), and with Hidden Markov models trained on multiple sequence alignments using the HMMER 2.0.1 package (38Eddy S.R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). Upon protein comparisons, the Blossum62 (39Henikoff S. Henikoff J.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) was used as the scoring inter-residues table. The obtained alignments were also sent as inputs for the PhD program (40Rost B. Casadio R. Fariselli P. Sander C. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 521-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 41Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to predict secondary structures and transmembrane helices. Cluster phylogenetic trees were reconstructed using the neighbor-joining (NJ) algorithm of Saitou and Nei (42Saitou N. Nei M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 406-425PubMed Google Scholar) with the Kimura correction (43Kimura M. The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, NY1983: 367Google Scholar) and were evaluated with 1000 bootstrap trials, as implemented in the ClustalX program. Parsimonious trees were generated through exhaustive search and evaluated with bootstrap analysis using a UNIX version of the PAUP* 4.0.0d55 program (44Swofford D.L. PAUP* Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony, Version 4. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2000Google Scholar) that is included in the GCG-Wisconsin Package programs (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Trees were prepared and modified using the TreeView program (45Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). The methods for HCoV propagation in MRC-5 cells (ECACC 84101801) and concentration of virus with polyethylene glycol have been described previously (46Ziebuhr J. Herold J. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HCoV ORF 1a nucleotide sequence coding for the pp1a/pp1ab amino acids 112–322 was amplified by PCR from pBS-J12E6 plasmid DNA (47Herold J. Raabe T. Schelle-Prinz B. Siddell S.G. Virology. 1993; 195: 680-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) using primers 134 and 135. The upstream primer contained a BamHI restriction site, and the downstream primer contained a translation stop codon followed by aPstI restriction site. The PCR product was digested withBamHI and PstI and ligated withBamHI/PstI-digested pMal-c2 DNA (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany). The resulting plasmid, pMal-H2, encoded the specified ORF1a amino acids fused to the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP). The plasmid was used to transform competent E. coli TB1 cells, and the bacterial fusion protein was expressed and purified as described previously (46Ziebuhr J. Herold J. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,48Herold J. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 68-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The HCoV-specific polypeptide, which contained 211 amino acids of pp1a/pp1ab and is preceded by six N-terminal vector-derived amino acids, was released from MBP by cleavage with endoprotease Xa (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to immunize rabbits as described previously (46Ziebuhr J. Herold J. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting antiserum was designated α-H2. Infection or mock infection of MRC-5 cells was done essentially as described previously (49Ziebuhr J. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 106 MRC-5 cells were mock-infected or infected with HCoV at a multiplicity of 10 plaque-forming units per cell. Radioactive labeling of newly synthesized proteins was done for 2.5 h, between 7 and 9.5 h postinfection, with 100 µCi ofl-[35S]methionine per ml. Before labeling, the cells were washed twice with methionine-free minimal essential medium supplemented with 2% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (46Ziebuhr J. Herold J. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One hundred microliters of cell lysate was mixed with 400 µl of immunoprecipitation buffer (46Ziebuhr J. Herold J. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 5 µl of preimmune serum or 5 µl of α-H2 serum. After 60 min at 4 °C, 25 µl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (P9424; Sigma) was added to isolate the immune complexes, which were washed and eluted as described previously (46Ziebuhr J. Herold J. Siddell S.G. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4331-4338Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a 10–17% gradient gel and autoradiography. Previously, the HCoV PL2pro coding sequence has been found to be non-clonable in E. coli (47Herold J. Raabe T. Schelle-Prinz B. Siddell S.G. Virology. 1993; 195: 680-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We therefore used PCR-based methods to express this region of the HCoV genome. If not otherwise specified, we used a DNA template that had been isolated from a recombinant vaccinia virus, vHCoV-inf-1, carrying a complete cDNA copy of the HCoV genome (30Thiel V. Herold J. Schelle B. Siddell S.G. J. Gen. Virol. 2001; 82: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of all PCR products used for in vitro RNA synthesis were determined to exclude any PCR-derived nucleotide misincorporations. The amino acid sequences of the proteins analyzed in this study are summarized in Fig.2, and the primers used to generate appropriate DNA templates for in vitro RNA synthesis are given in Table I. To produce proteins pp717–1285, pp717–1436, pp717–1910, and pp759–1910, the coding sequences of the HCoV pp1a/pp1ab amino acids 717–1285, 717–1436, 717–1910, and 759–1910 were amplified by PCR using the primer pairs 111/103, 111/105, 111/107, and 110/107, respectively. The upstream primers (110 and 111, respectively) contained a T7 RNA polymerase promoter followed by an initiator Met codon and the downstream primers (103, 105, and 107, respectively) contained a translation stop codon. By using the purified PCR products as templates, capped RNAs were synthesized in vitro by use of a Riboprobe T7 system (P1440 and P1711; Promega, Mannheim, Germany) and subsequently translated in reticulocyte lysate (L4960, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine as described previously (48Herold J. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 68-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After 40 min, the translation reactions (15-µl mixtures) were stopped by the addition of 1.7 µl of 10× translation stop mix (0.1 mg of RNase A per ml, 10 mg of cycloheximide per ml, 5 mm[32S]methionine), and the mixtures were divided into 2 aliquots. One of the aliquots was stored at −80 °C, and the other one was further incubated at 30 °C for 120 min. Finally, 0.2 µl of each reaction aliquot was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. To obtain quantitative data on the extent of substrate conversion, the radioactivities incorporated into the full-length substrate and the C-terminal cleavage product were determined using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with ImageQuant 1.1 software. The data obtained were adjusted to the number of methionines present in the respective proteins, and the calculations were done essentially as described by Teng et al. (50Teng H. Piñón J.D. Weiss S.R. J.

Open table in a new tab To generate pp717–1285_C1054A, the coding sequence of pp1a/pp1ab amino acids 717–1285 was amplified by PCR using primers 111 and 103. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated into the NcoI-EcoRI site of plasmid pBST (51Grötzinger C. Heusipp G. Ziebuhr J. Harms U. Süss J. Siddell S.G. Virology. 1996; 222: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid, pBST-111–103, was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis by in vivo recombination PCR (48Herold J. Siddell S.G. Ziebuhr J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 275: 68-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,52Yao Z. Jones D.H. Grose C. PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 1: 205-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using primers 112 and 113. The resulting plasmid was designated pBST-111–103_C1054A. Both pBST-111–103_C1054A DNA and the parental pBST-111–103 DNA were linearized with EcoRI and used as templates for RNA synthesis. To generate pp717–1285_VM, an in vivo recombination PCR was done using primers 188 and 189 and pBST-111–103 DNA as a template. The resulting plasmid, pBST-111–103_VM, was linearized withEcoRI and used as a template for RNA synthesis. pp717–1285_VM contained the pp1a/pp1ab amino acids 717–1285 in which each of the three valine residues, Val900, Val906, and Val908, was replaced with methionine (V900M, V906M, and V908M). To generate pp717–1910_C1054A-VM, an in vivo recombination PCR was done using primers 112 and 113 and pBST-111–103_VM plasmid DNA as a template. The resulting plasmid, pBST-111–103_C1054A-VM, served then as a template to amplify nucleotides 2441–3912 using primers 111 and 139. In a separate reaction, nucleotides 3881–6022 were amplified from vHCoV-inf-1 genomic DNA by using primers 165 and 107. The two PCR products were digested with BsaI, purified, and ligated together by using T4 DNA ligase. The ligated product was then used as a template for second round PCR amplification with outside primers 111 and 107. The resulting 3,614-base pair PCR product was used as a template for RNA synthesis. To generate pp717–1910_C1054A/W1702L, nucleotides 2441–3912 were amplified from pBST-111–103_C1054A plasmid DNA by using primers 111 and 139, and nucleotides 3881–6022 were amplified from vaccinia virus vF10 DNA 2V.

The two PCR products were digested with BsaI and ligated together with T4 DNA ligase. The ligated product was then used as a template for second round PCR amplification with primers 111 and 107. The RNA derived from the purified PCR template encoded the pp1a/pp1ab amino acids 717–1910 in which active-site residues of both PL1pro and PL2pro have been replaced (C1054A and W1702L, respectively). To generate pp717–1910_C1054A, nucleotides 2006–3451 and 3454–6022 were amplified by PCR from vHCoV-inf-1 genomic DNA in two separate reactions by using the primer pairs 137/212 and 213/39, respectively.

Activation of protein synthesis by PE is involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. One component involved here is p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), which lies downstream of mammalian target of rapamycin, whose regulation is thought to involve phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B (PKB). S6K2 is a recently identified homolog of S6K1 whose regulation is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that in adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes, PE and insulin each activate S6K2, activation being 3.5- and 5-fold above basal, respectively. Rapamycin completely blocked S6K2 activation by either PE or insulin. Three different inhibitors of MEK1/2 abolished PE-induced activation of S6K2 whereas expression of constitutively active MEK1 activated S6K2, without affecting the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and JNK pathways, indicating that MEK/ERK signaling plays a key role in regulation of S6K2 by PE. PE did not activate PKB, and expression of dominant negative PKB failed to block activation of S6K2 by PE, indicating PE-induced S6K2 activation is independent of PKB. However, this PKB mutant did partially block S6K2 activation by insulin, indicating PKB is required here. Another hypertrophic agent, endothelin 1, also activated S6K2 in a MEK-dependent manner.

S6K1 is thought to regulate the translation of a subset of mRNAs that are characterized by the presence at their 5′ termini of a tract of pyrimidines (5′-TOP mRNAs) and generally encode ribosomal proteins and elongation factors (1Jefferies H.B.

According to this model, activation of S6K1 leads to up-regulation of ribosome biosynthesis and increases the translational capacity of the cell. The control of S6K1 has been the subject of detailed investigations in several laboratories. Activation of S6K1 involves its phosphorylation at multiple serine/threonine residues probably catalyzed by several upstream kinases. Recent studies have shown that at least two signaling pathways influence S6K1. One pathway involves PI 3-kinase, and its downstream effector, PDK1 (which phosphorylates a site in the catalytic domain of S6K1, T229/252 in the cytoplasmic and nuclear forms of S6K1, respectively (3Alessi D.R.

An additional pathway essential for S6K1 activation involves the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as revealed using the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which inhibits mTOR and activation of S6K1 by all stimuli tested and using specific mutants of mTOR (7Burnett P.E.

Other phosphorylation sites involved in the activation of S6K1 lie in its C-terminal domain and are followed by Pro residues, suggesting they may be targets for proline-directed kinase(s). However, although S6K1 can be phosphorylated in vitro by MAP kinase (a proline-directed enzyme; see Ref. 9Mukhopadhayay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S.L. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Luther H. Thomas G. Nature. 1991; 349: 348-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). S6K2 is a recently identified homolog of S6K1 that phosphorylates S6in vitro and is highly homologous to S6K1 in the core kinase and linker regulatory domains but differs from S6K1 in its N- and C-terminal regions and is differently localized being primarily nuclear because of a C-terminal nuclear localization signal not found in S6K1 (11Gout I.

Studies of exogenous or endogenous S6K2 in other cell systems (cell lines) imply that S6K2 is regulated by PI 3-kinase signaling and by mTOR. In these respects it is thus similar to S6K1 (13Lee-Fruman K.K. Kou C.J. Lippincott J. Terada N. Blenis J. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5108-5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Koh H. Jee K.

Given the importance of S6 kinases in the regulation of protein synthesis and the fact that PE and insulin each activate S6K1 in cardiomyocytes (21Boluyt M.O. Zheng J.S. Younes A. Long X. O'Neill L.

Our data show that regulation of S6K2 by PE is dependent on MEK/ERK signaling. Another GPCR agonist, endothelin 1 (ET-1), which is also a hypertrophic agent (23Shubeita H.E. McDonough P.M.

Furthermore, we show that the expression of a constitutively active mutant of MEK1 causes activation of S6K2 in cardiomyocytes. Activation of S6K2 by insulin is also partially dependent upon MEK/ERK signaling. This study provides strong evidence for novel signaling connections between MEK/ERK and S6K2, which might be involved in the control of mRNA translation in primary adult cardiomyocytes.

To study whether S6K2 is regulated by PE and insulin in ARVC, we treated ARVC with PE and insulin for differing times. Significant activation of S6K2 was first observed 30 min after PE treatment and reached a maximum after 60 min, as assessed both by activity measurements (using a peptide substrate) after immunoprecipitation of the enzyme (Fig.1A) and by Western blot analysis, which showed that activation of S6K2 is accompanied by a reduction in its mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B), presumably because of its increased phosphorylation at multiple sites. The extent of this shift correlated well with alterations in S6K2 activity (Fig.1, A and B). Such behavior is also a well documented characteristic of S6K1. The activity of S6K2 remained elevated above basal for at least 4 h after PE treatment but declined toward control level at later times (Fig. 1, A andB). Maximal activation of S6K2 by insulin required ∼30 min, and activity subsequently declined (Fig. 1, C andD). Previous studies have suggested that regulation of p70 S6 kinases involves PI 3-kinase and PKB (3Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice M. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 4Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Our earlier studies indicated that this is also so for the regulation of S6K1 by insulin in ARVC (22Wang L. Wang X. Proud C.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1056-H1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether PE activated PI 3-kinase signaling in ARVC, we studied the phosphorylation of PKB, an effector of PI 3-kinase signaling (28Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Activation of PKB involves its phosphorylation at Ser473 in the C-terminal tail and Thr308 in the catalytic domain (PKBα). Western blots using an antibody that specifically recognizes phospho-Ser473 of PKB showed no detectable phosphorylation at this site in cells treated with PE over a 60-min period (Fig.2A, upper blot). The total amount of PKB extracted from the cells did not change under different conditions, as shown by Western blots using a different antibody that recognizes PKB irrespective of its state of phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, lower blot). Insulin, which was previously shown to activate PKB in adult cardiomyocytes (22Wang L. Wang X. Proud C.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1056-H1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), induced marked phosphorylation of PKB in parallel experiments performed as positive controls (Fig. 2 A). Similar results were obtained using specific anti-phospho-Thr308-PKB antibody (data not shown). Our previous work also showed that phosphorylation of PKB correlates very closely with its activation in adult cardiomyocytes (22Wang L. Wang X. Proud C.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1056-H1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus PE does not appear to activate PKB in ARVC, and regulation of S6K2 in response to PE must therefore involve other signaling events. GPCR agonists, including PE and ET-1, markedly activate MAP kinase (ERK) in cardiomyocytes (18Bogoyevitch M.A. Andersson M.B. Gillespie-Brown J. Clerk A. Glennon P.E. Fuller S.J. Sugden P.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 29Bogoyevitch M.A. Glennon P.E. Andersson M.B. Clerk A. Lazou A. Marshall C.J. Parker P.J. Sugden P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1110-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggested that ERK signaling might play a role in S6K2 activation in ARVC. To explore possible links between the ERK pathway and S6K2, we first studied the activation of ERKs by PE and insulin in ARVC. PE caused a rapid activation of both ERK1 and ERK2 in ARVC, as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of these kinases (Fig.2 B). Activation was maximal within 5 min after addition of PE, after which it declined substantially but was still apparent up to 2 h (Fig. 2 B). Separate experiments showed that ERK phosphorylation was still elevated above the very low level seen in untreated cells up to at least 8 h after PE treatment (data not shown). Maximal activation of ERK1/2 by insulin was also seen at 5 min, as revealed by extended exposure of the immunoblot (Fig.2 C), but was much lower than that caused by PE (see Fig.2 D for a direct comparison). The MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (30Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar) completely abolished ERK activation (Fig. 2 D). Similar results were obtained when other two structurally distinct inhibitors of MEK1/2, PD98059 (31Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar, 32Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Tecle H. Barrett S.D. Bridges A. Przybranowski S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar), were used (data not shown). As expected, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 did not affect ERK activation (Fig. 2 D). Because PE activates ERK1/2 but not PKB in ARVC, we next examined whether the MEK/ERK pathway played a role in the regulation of S6K2. To do this, we made use of MEK inhibitors, because they effectively block the activation of ERK1/2 by PE in ARVC (Fig. 2 D, and data not shown). Pretreatment of ARVC with U0126 prior to addition of PE abolished the ability of PE to induce activation of S6K2, as assessed by both activity measurements (Fig.3A) and by Western blot analysis, which showed that these compounds blocked the characteristic reduction in mobility of this protein on SDS-PAGE normally seen after PE treatment (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained when the other MEK inhibitors PD98059 and PD184352 were applied (data not shown). These data suggested that the MEK/ERK pathway plays a critical role in the regulation of S6K2 by PE. Despite the fact that PE did not appear to activate PKB, and thus by implication PI 3-kinase, we also tested the effect of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 on the activation of S6K2 by PE. Surprisingly, this compound completely blocked the activation of S6K2 by PE (Fig. 3,A and B), suggesting that PI 3-kinase activity is nonetheless important for the activation of S6K2 by this agent. The ability of insulin to activate S6K2 was completely inhibited by LY294002, as demonstrated by both activity measurements and the mobility of this enzyme on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3, C andD). This was expected as insulin strongly activates PI 3-kinase signaling/PKB in ARVC (22Wang L. Wang X. Proud C.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1056-H1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of MEK activity also partially impaired S6K2 activation (and to a small extent, its phosphorylation) in response to insulin (Fig. 3, C andD). Insulin-induced S6K2 activation was inhibited by 34.3% by U0126 (Fig. 3 C) (*, p < 0.01). These results suggest a partial involvement of the MEK/ERK pathway in the effects of insulin on S6K2, consistent with the modest ability of insulin to activate ERKs in ARVC (Fig. 2, C andD). Stimulation of S6K2 by PE or insulin was completely blocked by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Fig. 3, A–D) confirming that, like S6K1, regulation of S6K2 requires mTOR in ARVC. To investigate further the role of MEK/ERK in the regulation of S6K2, we examined the effect of a constitutively active mutant of MEK1, the specific upstream activator of ERK1/2. The activated MEK1 mutant was expressed in ARVC using an adenovirus vector (AxMEKCA). As indicated by Western blotting using an antibody specific for MEK1 (Fig.4A, top blot), infection of ARVC with AxMEKCA at an m.o.i. of 1–50 resulted in a dose-dependent expression of MEK1 in ARVC and concomitantly activated ERK1 and ERK2, as shown by increased phosphorylation of these enzymes (Fig. 4 A, topand middle blots). The level of ERK2 protein was not affected (Fig. 4 A, bottom blot). Infection of ARVC with an adenovirus expressing β-galactosidase (AxLacZ) (m.o.i. of 10) as a control had no effect on MEK1 expression or ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 4 A). Activation of ERK1/2 caused by infection of cells with AxMEKCA at an m.o.i. of 10 plaque-forming units/cell was significantly blocked by U0126, whereas, as expected, LY294002 and rapamycin did not inhibit this (Fig.4 B, top and middle panels). Infection of cells with AxMEKCA at an m.o.i. of 10 plaque-forming units/cell induced a marked increase in S6K2 activity and phosphorylation (Fig. 4, C and D), to a similar extent of that caused by PE (Fig. 3, A and B). This activation was almost completely inhibited by U0126 (Fig. 4,C and D). Similar inhibitory effects were observed using the other two MEK inhibitors PD98059 or PD184352 (data not shown). The PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 completely blocked the activation of S6K2 by activated MEK, again suggesting a requirement for PI 3-kinase signaling activity in the activation of S6K2 (Fig. 4,C and D). Rapamycin also completely inhibited S6K2 activation by MEK1, indicating that mTOR activity is essential for MEK-driven activation of S6K2 (Fig. 4, C and D). Infection of cells with a control adenovirus (AxLacZ) did not affect S6K2 activity in ARVC (Fig. 4, C and D). To assess whether PKB activity is required for the regulation of S6K2 by PE and insulin, we next examined the effect of a dominant negative mutant of PKB, a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase, on the PE- and insulin-induced activation of S6K2. Infection of ARVC with an adenovirus vector encoding FLAG-tagged dominant negative PKB (AxPKB-AA) led to dose-dependent expression of this mutant (PKB-AA) as demonstrated by Western blots using an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5A, upper blot). A blot showing the level of endogenous ERK2 was also carried out to verify the same loading of all samples (Fig.5 A, lower blot). The dominant negative effect of PKB-AA was confirmed by examining the phosphorylation of GSK3, a downstream effector of PKB, in PKB-AA-transfected ARVC in response to insulin. Expression of PKB-AA in ARVC inhibited the phosphorylation of GSK3 induced by insulin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.5 B), indicating that this kinase-dead mutant interferes with the function of the endogenous PKB. This result is consistent with a previous report in that expression of this PKB mutant inhibited the activation of endogenous PKB by insulin in Chinese hamster ovary and 3T3-L1 cells (6Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Infection of AxPKB-AA at an m.o.i. of 10 plaque-forming units/cell did not affect the activation or phosphorylation of S6K2 by PE in ARVC (Fig. 5, C and E) but did impair its activation by insulin in these cells, activation of S6K2 by insulin being inhibited by 33.4% (Fig. 5 D, *, p < 0.01, and E). These results suggest that, in ARVC, PKB is not required for activation of S6K2 by PE but that it is involved in the stimulation of S6K2 by insulin. To explore further the possibility that other GPCR agonists act similarly to PE in ARVC, we tested the effect of ET-1 on the regulation of S6K2. Like PE, ET-1 strongly activated ERK1/2 (Fig.6A) and did not induce phosphorylation of PKB (data not shown). Treatment of ARVC with ET-1 resulted in marked activation of S6K2, as shown by both kinase activity and mobility shift (Fig. 6, B and C). Again, this stimulation was abolished by the MEK inhibitor U0126. LY294002 and rapamycin also completely inhibited activation of S6K2 by ET-1 (Fig. 6,B and C). These results imply that, in ARVC, these GPCR agonists regulate S6K2 activity in a similar manner, which depends on MEK/ERK signaling. It was clearly possible that the stimulation of S6K2 by expression of activated MEK1 might also be mediated, in whole or part, by other MAP kinase pathways, which could be switched on as a consequence of high level expression of activated MEK1. To investigate other pathways, we first studied the ability of activated MEK1 to activate the p38 MAP kinase subfamily. We assessed this by examining the phosphorylation of these enzymes and of hsp27, a substrate for mitogen-activated protein kinase APK-2, which is itself activated by p38 MAP kinase α 47 β (Fig.7A). A single immunoreactive band was seen in untreated ARVC when using the anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibody. Infection of ARVC with AxMEKCA at an m.o.i. of 10 plaque-forming units/cell had no effect on the phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase or hsp27 (Fig. 7 A,top and middle blots, and data not shown for other sites in hsp27; see legend). We also tested whether overexpression of MEK1 activated JNK by an in vitro kinase assay using GST-c-Jun (amino acids 1–135) as substrate (Fig.7 B). Again, no activation of this pathway was observed (Fig.7 B). As a positive control, we treated human embryonic kidney 293 cells with arsenite, and this showed strong activation of JNK (Fig. 7 B). These data apparently rule out the possibility that these pathways might contribute to the activation of S6K2 caused by MEK1 expression. It seems likely that this activation reflects a role for MEK itself or ERK1/2 (or other downstream kinases) in the regulation of S6K2. To examine whether the p38 MAP kinase or JNK pathways are involved in the activation of S6K2 by PE or ET-1, we first"
https://openalex.org/W2094427247,"The human p53 protein acts mainly as a stress inducible transcription factor transactivating several genes involved in cell cycle arrest (e.g. p21) or apoptosis (e.g. Bax, PIG3). Roughly half of all human tumours contains p53 missense mutations. Virtually all tumour-derived p53 mutants are unable to activate Bax transcription but some retain the ability to activate p21 transcription. Identification of these mutants may have valuable clinical implications. We have determined the transactivation ability of 77 p53 mutants using reporter yeast strains containing a p53-regulated ADE2 gene whose promoter is regulated by p53 responsive elements derived from the regulatory region of the p21, Bax and PIG3 genes. We also assessed the influence of temperature on transactivation. Our results indicate that a significant proportion of mutants [16/77 (21%); 10/64 (16%) considering only tumour-derived mutants] are transcriptionally active, especially with the p21 promoter. Discriminant mutants preferentially affect less conserved (P<0.04, Fisher's exact test), more rarely mutated (P<0.006, Fisher's exact test) amino acids. Temperature sensitivity is frequently observed, but is more common among discriminant than non-discriminant mutants (P<0.003, Fisher's exact test). Finally, we extended the analysis to a group of mutants isolated in BRCA-associated tumours that surprisingly were indistinguishable from wild type in standard transcription, growth suppression and apoptosis assays in human cells, but showed gain of function in transformation assays. The incidence of transcriptionally active mutations among this group was significantly higher than in the panel of mutants studied previously (P<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Since it is not possible to predict the behaviour of a mutant from first principles, we propose that the yeast assay be used to compile a functional p53 database and fill the gap between the biophysical, pharmacological and clinical fields."
https://openalex.org/W2005440054,"A previously unidentified Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain-containing protein was found in a yeast two-hybrid screen for cDNAs encoding proteins binding to the Src homology 3 domain of Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4). The protein was named RICH-1 (RhoGAP interacting withCIP4 homologues), and, in addition to the RhoGAP domain, it contained an N-terminal domain with endophilin homology and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. Transient transfections of RICH-1 indicated that it bound to CIP4 in vivo, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, as well as co-localization assays. In vitro assays demonstrated that the RhoGAP domain of RICH-1 catalyzed GTP hydrolysis on Cdc42 and Rac1, but not on RhoA. Ectopic expression of the RhoGAP domain as well as the full-length protein interfered with platelet-derived growth factor BB-induced membrane ruffling, but not with serum-induced stress fiber formation, further emphasizing the notion that, in vivo, RICH-1 is a GAP for Cdc42 and Rac1. A previously unidentified Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain-containing protein was found in a yeast two-hybrid screen for cDNAs encoding proteins binding to the Src homology 3 domain of Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4). The protein was named RICH-1 (RhoGAP interacting withCIP4 homologues), and, in addition to the RhoGAP domain, it contained an N-terminal domain with endophilin homology and a C-terminal proline-rich domain. Transient transfections of RICH-1 indicated that it bound to CIP4 in vivo, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation experiments, as well as co-localization assays.

The cytoskeleton is formed by three distinct filament systems, the microfilament system, the intermediate filament system, and the microtubule system, which act in concert to orchestrate processes such as cell locomotion, changes in cell morphology, and intracellular transport (1Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal elements, in particular, the microfilament system, are under a constant reconstruction in response to external stimuli. There exists a close correlation between the activation of transmembrane receptors as well as cell adhesion molecules and the mobilization of the microfilament system (1Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar, 2Schmidt A. Hall M.N. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 305-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Actin monomers, which polymerize into asymmetric filaments, form the core of the microfilament system. In addition, a large number of actin-binding proteins assist in organization of actin filaments in a variety of supramolecular structures. A family of signaling intermediates, the Rho GTPases, has been shown to be a pivotal regulator of the microfilament system and thereby of the morphogenetic and motile properties of mammalian cells. Each member of the archetypal trio of Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, has been found to regulate distinct actin filament-containing structures. Rho regulates the formation of focal adhesions and the subsequent assembly of stress fibers, and Rac regulates the formation of membrane lamellae, whereas Cdc42 triggers the outgrowth of peripheral spike-like protrusions called filopodia (3Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5216) Google Scholar, 4Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar). The potential of the Rho GTPases to function as signaling switches resides in their ability to cycle between active, GTP-bound states and inactive, GDP-bound states. This cycling is orchestrated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs),1 and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors stimulate the replacement of GDP by GTP, whereas GAPs stimulate the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of the GTPase (5Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 6Lamarche N. Hall A.

Biol. 1999; 22: 85-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors act by blocking GDP dissociation, and, in resting cells, the Rho GTPases are thought to reside in an inactive complex with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor proteins (7Zalcman G. Dorseuil O. Garcia-Ranea J.A. Gacon G. Camonis J. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1999; 22: 85-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recent work has revealed that, in mammals, the Rho family consists of at least 16 distinct members that can be further divided into six subgroups: Cdc42 (Cdc42, TC10, TCL, and Chp), Rac (Rac1–3 and RhoG), Rho (Rho A-C), Rnd (Rnd1–2 and RhoE), RhoD, and RhoH (9Aspenström P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 10Vignal E. De Toledo M. Comunale F. Ladopoulou A. Gauthier-Rouvière C. Blangy A. Fort P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36457-36464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, the Rho GTPases have been shown to regulate several vital cellular processes in addition to cytoskeletal rearrangements. Rac and Cdc42 participate in transcriptional control via the Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase and p38MAPKsignaling cascades, Rho has a role in serum response factor-regulated gene transcription, and all three contribute to transcriptional activation via the nuclear factor κB signaling pathway (4Van Aelst L.

Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Rho GTPases are also participants in signaling leading to cell cycle entry and apoptosis (4Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 13Gómez J. Martı́nez-A C. González A. Rebollo A. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The identification of binding partners for the Rho GTPases has resulted in insights into the mechanisms by which these proteins mobilize the microfilament system (4Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2094) Google Scholar, 14Aspenström P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 15Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar). A major advancement in our understanding originates from the work on the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family of proteins, which have emerged as important regulators of actin assembly in eukaryotic cells (16Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 17Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 117-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This family of proteins also includes N-WASP and Scar/WAVE 1–3 (18Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 905-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). WASP was originally identified as the gene defective in the rare immunodeficiency disorder Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (19Derry J.M. Ochs H.D. Francke U. Cell. 1994; 78: 635-644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar, 20Ochs H.D. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1998; 19: 435-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). WASP is a multidomain adapter protein that contains a phosphoinositide-binding domain, a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) domain that specifically binds Cdc42 (21Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), and an extended proline-rich domain that binds SH3 domain-containing proteins such as Nck, Src, and Btk/Tec (18Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 905-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was recently found that the members of the WASP family bind directly to actin and to the so-called Arp2/3 complex. This multisubunit protein complex has an essential role in regulating actin polymerization in cells. It is suggested that Arp2/3 is needed for both the formation of new actin filaments and binding to the sides of actin filaments, thereby forming branched actin filament networks (16Pollard T.D. Blanchoin L. Mullins R.D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 29: 545-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 17Zigmond S.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 117-120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Snapper S.B. Rosen F.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 905-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Several other Cdc42-binding proteins have been found to affect the organization of the actin cytoskeleton, although the mechanisms by which they act are less well known. A common denominator for most of these proteins is the presence of a CRIB domain (21Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). For instance, MSE55 has been shown to induce filopodia-like protrusions when overexpressed in fibroblasts (22Burbelo P.D. Snow D.M. Bahou W. Spiegel S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9083-9088Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas some of the five known MSE55-related Borg (binders of Rho GTPases) proteins have been suggested to function as negative regulators of Rho (23Joberty G. Perlungher R.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6585-6597Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The SPEC-1/2 (small protein effectors of Cdc42) proteins induce an accumulation of polymerized actin in peripheral membrane protrusions in fibroblasts (24Pirone D.M. Fukuhara S. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22650-22656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cdc42-interacting protein 4 (CIP4), however, binds Cdc42 via a domain motif unrelated to the CRIB domain (25Aspenström P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Overexpression of CIP4 in fibroblasts leads to the disappearance of filamentous actin bundles in these cells. Moreover, simultaneous expression of activated Cdc42 and CIP4 results in a relocalization of the uniformly distributed CIP4 into peripheral and dorsal clusters or villi-like structures, which might represent precursors of filopodia (25Aspenström P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms by which CIP4 acts, we sought to identify binding partners for the protein. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a previously uncharacterized RhoGAP domain-containing protein that specifically interacted with the SH3 domain of CIP4. We named this protein RICH-1 (RhoGAP interacting withCIP4 homologues). The N-terminal portion of RICH-1, including the RhoGAP domain, was shown to be homologous to a protein of unknown function, KIAA0672, which we propose should be renamed RICH-2. The RhoGAP domain of RICH-1 was furthermore shown to be similar to the analogous domain of the Abl-binding protein 3BP-1 (26Cicchetti P. Mayer B.J. Thiel G. Baltimore D. Science. 1992; 257: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The high degree of similarity between the proteins suggested that RICH-1, RICH-2, and 3BP-1 form a closely related family of RhoGAPs.In vitro assays demonstrated that the RhoGAP domains of RICH-1 and RICH-2 specifically activate the GTP hydrolysis of Rac1 and Cdc42, but not of RhoA. Ectopic expression of the RhoGAP domain of RICH-1 abrogated PDGF-BB-induced membrane ruffles but not the serum-induced stress-fibers, further emphasizing the notion that RICH-1 is a Rac and Cdc42-specific GAP. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y190 (genotype, MATa,gal4–542, gal80–538, his3,trp1–901, ade2–101, ura3–52,leu2–3, 112, URA3::GAL1-LacZ, Lys2::GAL1-HIS3cyhr) was transformed with a cDNA encoding the SH3 domain of CIP4 (amino acid residues 489–545) fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in the pYTH6 vector. This GAL4 DNA-binding domain-CIP4:SH3-expressing yeast strain was used to screen a cDNA library from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cells fused to the GAL4 activation domain in the pACT vector as described previously (25Aspenström P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 27Aspenström P. Olson M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Thirteen clones encoding potential CIP4-interacting proteins were isolated, one of which encoded a partial cDNA for a previously uncharacterized RhoGAP domain-containing protein, which was subsequently named RICH-1. This yeast two-hybrid clone represented a fragment that was later found to encode amino acid residues 387–803 of the full-length polypeptide. The partial clone was used to screen a human brain λ ZAP II cDNA library following standard procedure (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Clones (9 × 106) were screened, and three positive clones were isolated after rescreening. These clones were recovered as phagemid Bluescript SK−constructs by excision from the λ vector with helper phage R408 as described in Ref. 29Short J.M. Fernandez J.M. Sorge J.A. Huse W.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7583-7600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar. One of the clones contained a putative initiator codon; however, the predicted amino acid sequence stopped prematurely before the RhoGAP domain, resulting in an open reading frame of 226 amino acid residues. Polymerase chain reaction was employed to screen various cDNA libraries for splice variants of RICH-1 that encoded a RhoGAP domain-containing protein. The presence of a splice variant encoding an insert of an extra 82 bp was detected in human B cells as well as in HeLa cells. This splice variant encoded a protein with an open reading frame of 803 amino acid residues. We designated the long form RICH-1 and the short form RICH-1B. The nucleotide sequences of RICH-1 and RICH-2 have been deposited in the EMBL data base with the accession numbers AJ306731 (RICH-1) and AJ306732 (RICH-1B). Fragments of RICH-1, RICH-1B, and RICH-1 RhoGAP domain were generated as BamHI-EcoRI polymerase chain reaction fragments and inserted into the pRK5myc vector. The C-terminal domain of RICH-1 (amino acids 384–803) was subcloned into theHindIII and EcoRI sites of the pEGFP-C3 vector. The SH3 domains of CIP4 (amino acid residues 489–545), forming-binding protein 17 (amino acid residues 550–617), and syndapin (amino acid residues 376–441) were subcloned into the pGEX-2T vectors. DNA sequencing on a Perkin Elmer Genetic Analyzer 310 confirmed the fidelity of the nucleotide sequence. The DNA work followed standard procedures (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Sequential deletion mutants of RICH-1 lacking the proline-rich motives were generated by polymerase chain reaction (see Fig. 5 for a detailed description) and subcloned into the pRK5myc vector. The arginine to alanine mutation of RICH-1 in codon 288 (RICH-1R288A), which rendered the protein catalytically inactive, was generated by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Probes representing DNA fragments encoding amino acid residues 387–803 of RICH-1, amino acid residues 1–818 of RICH-2, and the 82-bp insert uniquely present in RICH-1 were labeled with [32P]CTP using the rediprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probes were then hybridized to hybridization-ready Northern blots (Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot; CLONTECH) according to the ExpressHyb (CLONTECH) protocol provided by the manufacturer. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of Rac1, Cdc42 (brain isoform), and RhoA were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and isolated from GST fusion proteins by thrombin cleavage as described previously (25Aspenström P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 479-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 30Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins of the RhoGAP domains of RICH-1 (amino acid residues 221–489), RICH-2 (KIAA0672 obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Chiba, Japan; amino acids residues 217–469), and p50RhoGAP (amino acid residues 230–439) were expressed in E. coli. The bacteria were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin (Trasylol; Beyer), and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The proteins were then eluted from the glutathione-Sepharose beads with 5 mm reduced glutathione, desalted on PD10 prepacked chromatography columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 1 mmDTT, and concentrated using Centricon-10 (Millipore). Protein concentrations were determined according to the Bradford method. GST fusion proteins of the SH3 domains described in Fig. 4 A were prepared as described above but were retained on the glutathione-Sepharose beads. The procedure we used essentially followed the procedure described by Self and Hall (31Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.1 μg of recombinant wild-type Rac, Rho, or Cdc42 was preloaded with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm DTT. The mixture was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, and then the reaction was terminated by adding 5 μl of 0.1m MgCl2, and the resulting [γ-32P]GTP-loaded GTPase solutions were stored on ice. For the GAP assays, equimolar amounts of the GTPases and the GST-GAP domains were used. Three μl of the [γ-32P]GTP-loaded GTPase was added to a 30-μl mixture of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm nonradioactive GTP, 0.87 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm DTT with the GST-RhoGAP domains of either RICH-1, RICH-2, or p50RhoGAP. The mixture was incubated at 30 °C, 5-μl aliquots were removed after 0, 3, 6, 9, and 15 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). The samples were collected on nitrocellulose filters and washed with 10 ml of ice-cold buffer A, and the portion of [γ-32P]GTP remaining bound to the GTPases was determined by scintillation counting. For the exchange assays, a similar protocol was employed, but 0.5 mCi of [8-3H]GTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used instead. Cos-1, Swiss 3T3, and NIH 3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (10% calf serum for NIH 3T3 cells) and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Porcine aortic endothelial cells stably expressing the PDGF-β receptor (clone PAE/PDGFRβ) were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented as described above. For the characterization of antisera, transiently transfected Cos-1 cells were metabolically labeled for 4 h at 37 °C with 15 μCi/ml Easy Tag EXPRESS35S protein labeling mix in MCDB 104 medium lacking cysteine and methionine and supplemented with HEPES. Cos-1 cells were transfected according to the DEAE-dextran method (32Kriegler M. Gene Transfer and Expression: A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Company, NY1990Crossref Google Scholar). Transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, washed once in ice-cold PBS, and lysed on ice in Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin (Trasylol; Beyer) and 1 mm DTT). Lysed cells were collected in Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 15 min. The resulting supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation experiments or GST pull-down assays. For co-immunoprecipitations of HA epitope-tagged CIP4 and myc epitope-tagged RICH-1, supernatants were incubated together with antibodies as indicated in the figure legends for 1 h at 4 °C, after which immunoprecipitates were collected on protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer was added to each sample. The immunoprecipitates as well as control cell lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the proteins were then transferred to Immobilon-P filters (Millipore). Western blots were detected by the BM chemiluminescence blotting substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The 35S-labeled RICH-1 immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the gels were fixed for 15 min in 25% methanol and 7.5% acetic acid and soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min. The gels were then dried and exposed on a phosphorimager (Fujix BAS 2000). For GST pull-down assays, supernatants from lysed RICH-1-transfected Cos-1 cells were incubated with GST fusion proteins of SH3 domains from a panel of proteins described in Fig. 4 A, and the presence of RICH-1 bound to the GST fusion protein was determined by Western blotting. For immunocytochemical analysis, Swiss 3T3 cells, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, or PAE/PDGFRβ cells were seeded on coverslips and transfected by LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer. GST fusion proteins of the PAK-CRIB and WASP-CRIB domains encompassing amino acids 56–267 and 201–321 of PAK1B and WASP, respectively, were purified essentially as described in Ref. 33Ren X.-D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. PAE/PDGFRβ cells were transiently transfected with pRK5mycCdc42 or pRK5mycRac1 in combination with the pRK5mycRICH-1 RhoGAP domain or pRK5myc encoding the catalytically inactive R288A mutant RICH-1 RhoGAP domain. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2. The cells were then lysed on ice in a cold room with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell lysates were immediately subjected to centrifugation. Active, GTP-bound Rac1 and Cdc42 were isolated from the supernatants by the addition of GST-PAK-CRIB and GST-WASP-CRIB, respectively, followed by a 10-min incubation. The beads were washed three times with a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the extent of GTP-bound Cdc42 and Rac1 was determined by Western blotting. Antisera were raised against peptides representing amino acid residues 53–67 (antiserum N) and 779–792 (antiserum C) of human RICH-1. These antisera, as well as mouse anti-myc (9E10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-HA (12CA5;Roche Molecular Biochemicals), rabbit anti-green fluorescent protein (CLONTECH), and tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC)- and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies (DAKO), were used for immunoprecipitations and to determine the subcellular localization of CIP4 and RICH-1 mutants. Filamentous actin was visualized by TRITC- or FITC-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma). For immunocytochemistry assays, the cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. The cells were washed with PBS and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. The cells were then washed again and incubated in the presence of 10 mm glycine in PBS for 1 h. Primary as well as secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% fetal calf serum. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies followed by secondary antibodies for intervals of 1 h, with a washing step in between. The coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) on object slides. Cells were photographed by a Hamamatsu ORCA charge-coupled device digital camera employing the QED Imaging System software using a Zeiss Axioplan2 microscope. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify binding partners for CIP4. In a screen, employing the SH3 domain of CIP4 as bait, 13 CIP4-interacting clones were isolated from a cDNA library from Epstein-Barr virus-transformed human B cells. Data base searches showed that one of the clones represented a partial cDNA of a previously unidentified RhoGAP domain-containing protein, which we named RICH-1. This clone lacked a putative transcriptional start site; therefore, the partial cDNA was used to screen a λ ZAP II human brain cDNA library. Three positive clones were recovered, one of which contained a putative initiator codon in agreement with the Kozak consensus (34Kozak M. J. Biol.

Surprisingly, the predicted open reading frame resulted in a protein of only 226 amino acids, terminating immediately upstream of the RhoGAP domain. This suggested the existence of alternative splice variants of RICH. The polymerase chain reaction revealed the occurrence of an 82-bp insert located upstream of the RhoGAP domain in RICH cDNAs from human B cells and HeLa cells. The presence of this insert resulted in a transcript with a considerably longer open reading frame of 803 amino acid residues (Fig. 1 A). The insert could not be detected in brain-derived cDNAs (see also Fig.2 B). We named the 803- and 226-amino acid residue splice variants RICH-1 and RICH-1B, respectively (Fig. 1 B).Figure 2Northern blot analysis of mRNA from human tissues as indicated.

Due to the similarity between the two proteins, we suggest that KIAA0672 should be renamed RICH-2. These two proteins also displayed a high degree of similarity to the c-Abl-interacting protein 3BP-1, suggesting that the three proteins form a closely related family of RhoGAP proteins. RICH-1 and RICH-2 both contain an N-terminal domain with homology to the endophilin family of proteins (Fig. 1, B and D) (35Ringstad N. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8569-8574Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). RICH-1B encompasses only the endophilin-like domain, suggesting that this part of the protein has a unique but as yet unknown function. Data base searches against the nucleotide sequences released by the Human Genome Project indicate that 3BP-1 also contains a similar domain, which was not reported in the original publication of the 3BP-1 amino acid sequence (36Cicchetti P.

Protein synthesis in platelets is controlled at the translational level; however, the mechanisms of regulation are not known. Here we demonstrate that translation initiation factors are redistributed to mRNA-rich areas in aggregated platelets, an event that induces protein synthesis. Interrogation of cDNA arrays revealed that platelet-derived mRNAs are primarily associated with the cytoskeletal core. In contrast, eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), the essential mRNA cap-binding protein that controls global translation rates, is localized in the membrane skeleton and soluble fraction of platelets, physically separated from most mRNAs. Platelet activation redistributes eIF4E to the cytoskeleton and increases interactions of eIF4E with mRNA cap structures. Redistribution of eIF4E to the mRNA-rich cytoskeleton coincides with a marked increase in protein synthesis, a process that is blocked when intracellular actin is disrupted. Additional studies demonstrated that β3integrins are the primary membrane receptor that distributes eIF4E within the cell. These results imply that integrins link receptor-mediated pathways with mRNA-rich cytoskeletal domains and thereby modulate the organization of intracellular translational complexes.

However, we recently demonstrated that cellular activation globally increases protein synthesis indicating that the translational apparatus is intact and functional in platelets (2Weyrich A.S.

Regulated protein synthesis requires aggregation mediated by αIIbβ3 (1Pabla R. Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Bray P.F. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J.

Because platelets are anucleate cytoplasts, our results indicate that αIIbβ3 integrins modulate protein synthesis at the translational level (1Pabla R. Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Bray P.F. McIntyre T.M.

Other studies have implicated integrins as well, demonstrating that adhesion to extracellular matrix induces the rapid translation of preexisting mRNAs in nucleated cells (6Farmer S.R. Ben-Ze'av A.

Cell. 1978; 14: 931-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These results suggest that outside-in signals delivered by integrins, in addition to regulating a host of other postligand binding events, modulates protein synthesis at the translational level.Although integrins regulate translation, the mechanisms by which they do so are not known. Translation rates are primarily controlled at three steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. Regulation at the initiation phase is considered predominant and a primary target for translational control because it recruits ribosomes to mRNA (8Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) executes the pivotal function of bridging virtually all mRNAs to ribosomes (8Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). In nucleated cells, eIF4E activity is controlled by its transcription, phosphorylation, and binding to 4E-BP (eIF4E-Binding Protein) repressor proteins (9Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Cellular stress, cytokines, and growth factors evoke intracellular signaling pathways that influence eIF4E activity (9Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that outside-in signals delivered by integrins also regulate the functional status of eIF4E in platelets. However, instead of directly influencing eIF4E activity, αIIbβ3 integrins target this initiation factor to subcellular cytoskeletal domains that contain numerous mRNAs. Redistribution of eIF4E is required for signal-dependent protein synthesis, providing evidence that intracellular spatial localization is an important determinant of eIF4E function.DISCUSSIONTranslation of mRNA is regulated at multiple checkpoints that allow the cell to precisely control protein synthetic patterns. A prominent level of regulation occurs at the initiation step where eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) catalyze translation. eIF4E is the major rate-limiting initiation factor because it docks the eIF4F complex on the cap structure of the 5′-terminus of virtually all mRNAs. Thus, eIF4E regulates global translation rates in eukaryotic cells. Here we show that mRNAs are associated with the cytoskeletal core of resting platelets, physically separated from eIF4E. Platelet activation redistributes eIF4E to the mRNA-rich cytoskeleton, a process that is required for signal-dependent protein synthesis. αIIbβ3 integrins target eIF4E to these mRNA-rich areas, directly linking this surface receptor to a global translational checkpoint. Our findings emphasize the importance of spatial distribution of eIF4E for optimal protein synthesis, demonstrate the critical role of integrins in mediating this response, and provide further evidence that eIF4E is an important determinant of platelet function (16Rosenwald I.B. Pechet L. Han A. Lu L. Pihan G. Woda B. Chen J.J. Szymanski I. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).We previously demonstrated that platelets synthesize proteins in a signal-dependent fashion (2Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Pabla R. Elstad M.R. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5556-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Because platelets are anucleate cells, these results demonstrated that signals transmitted by αIIbβ3 are linked to translational control pathways. However, little is known about the exact mechanisms by which integrins regulate translational events. Integrin binding can induce the movement of mRNA and ribosomes to focal adhesion complexes that contain specific cytoskeletal components (18Chicurel M.E. Singer R.H. Meyer C.J. Ingber D.E. Nature. 1998; 392: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Gene expression can also be controlled locally by targeting mRNAs to specialized cytoskeletal domains (19Bassell G. Singer R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In resting platelets, we found that the majority of mRNAs are associated with the cytoskeletal core, physically separated from eIF4E. Segregation of the translational machinery in resting platelets provides an explanation for limited constitutive protein synthesis in these cells, as reported by numerous investigators (2Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Pabla R. Elstad M.R. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5556-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Booyse F.M. Zschocke D.

Biochem. 1988; 21: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation redistributes β3 integrins and eIF4E to the mRNA-rich cytoskeleton. When cytochalasin D or αIIbβ3antagonists disrupt intracellular trafficking, signal-dependent translation of IL-1β, Bcl-3, and other mRNAs is inhibited (see Fig. 5 and Refs. 1Pabla R. Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Bray P.F. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar and 25Lindemann, S., Tolley, N. D., Dixon, D. A., McIntyre, T. M., Prescott, S. M., Zimmerman, G. A., and Weyrich, A. S. (2001)J. Cell Biol., in press.Google Scholar). Presumably, this is due to the inability of eIF4E to interact with mRNAs associated with the cytoskeletal core, a hypothesis that is supported by our data demonstrating that inhibition of αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation prevents eIF4E from interacting with a specific mRNA cap homologue. The association of mRNAs with the cytoskeletal core also suggests that the cytoskeleton serves as a scaffold for regulated protein synthesis by platelets. In other cell types, the major sites of translation include the endoplasmic reticulum and the cytoskeleton (22Hovland R. Hesketh J.E. Pryme I.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because mature platelets generally do not contain endoplasmic reticulum (23Kieffer N. Guichard J. Farcet J.P. Vainchenker W. Breton-Gorius J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Ts'ao C.H. Scand. J. Haematol. 1971; 8: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the cytoskeletal network, which is extensive in platelets, is a logical site for regulated translation.Although not previously considered, our data demonstrate that spatial targeting of eIF4E within cells is an important mechanism that controls eIF4E function. In resting platelets, eIF4E is topographically found in the soluble fraction and the membrane skeleton. The membrane skeleton is a lattice-like structure that coats the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. It is composed of short actin filaments, actin-binding proteins, spectrin, and, vinculin (17Fox J.E.B. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1996: 217-233Google Scholar). It also contains GPIb-IX, α2β1 (GPIa-IIa), and αIIbβ3 (17Fox J.E.B. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1996: 217-233Google Scholar). Association with the membrane skeleton allows these adhesion molecules to play an important role in binding signaling molecules at sites of integrin-cytoskeletal junctions and thereby mediate signal transduction events in platelets. It is also believed that αIIbβ3 regulates the distribution of membrane skeletal components within the cell (11Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This notion is supported by studies where platelets from Glanzmann thrombasthenic patients do not effectively redistribute proteins to the cytoskeletal core in response to activation (11Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that eIF4E is found in the membrane skeleton suggests that it is ideally positioned for communication with transmembrane spanning proteins including αIIbβ3 and other cell surface receptors. The proximity of eIF4E to membrane receptors may also facilitate eIF4E phosphorylation in platelets, which occurs within 1 min of poststimulation.Tight regulation of eIF4E in platelets is not surprising since it is considered a primary target for translational control in nucleated cells (8Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli, such as hormones, growth factors, and mitogens augment translation rates by increasing the transcription of eIF4E or the phosphorylation of eIF4E and its repressor protein, 4E-BP1. In platelets, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and mTOR-dependent pathways inhibit eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, respectively. Under the conditions of these studies, interruption of αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation does not alter thrombin-induced phosphorylation of these proteins indicating that signal-dependent protein synthesis in platelets is controlled at multiple checkpoints.Our data provide new evidence that αIIbβ3integrins control the intracellular distribution of eIF4E and thereby regulate its function in platelets. Inhibition of platelet aggregation and subsequent protein synthesis (1Pabla R. Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Bray P.F. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J.

Our results also indicate that in addition to transcription and phosphorylation, the functional status of eIF4E is regulated by its intracellular distribution. Spatial targeting of eIF4E to mRNA-rich areas may control translation rates in nucleated cells as well.

Association with the membrane skeleton allows these adhesion molecules to play an important role in binding signaling molecules at sites of integrin-cytoskeletal junctions and thereby mediate signal transduction events in platelets. It is also believed that αIIbβ3 regulates the distribution of membrane skeletal components within the cell (11Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This notion is supported by studies where platelets from Glanzmann thrombasthenic patients do not effectively redistribute proteins to the cytoskeletal core in response to activation (11Fox J.E. Lipfert L. Clark E.A. Reynolds C.C. Austin C.D. Brugge J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25973-25984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that eIF4E is found in the membrane skeleton suggests that it is ideally positioned for communication with transmembrane spanning proteins including αIIbβ3 and other cell surface receptors. The proximity of eIF4E to membrane receptors may also facilitate eIF4E phosphorylation in platelets, which occurs within 1 min of poststimulation.Tight regulation of eIF4E in platelets is not surprising since it is considered a primary target for translational control in nucleated cells (8Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1740) Google Scholar). Extracellular stimuli, such as hormones, growth factors, and mitogens augment translation rates by increasing the transcription of eIF4E or the phosphorylation of eIF4E and its repressor protein, 4E-BP1. In platelets, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and mTOR-dependent pathways inhibit eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, respectively. Under the conditions of these studies, interruption of αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation does not alter thrombin-induced phosphorylation of these proteins indicating that signal-dependent protein synthesis in platelets is controlled at multiple checkpoints.Our data provide new evidence that αIIbβ3integrins control the intracellular distribution of eIF4E and thereby regulate its function in platelets. Inhibition of platelet aggregation and subsequent protein synthesis (1Pabla R. Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Bray P.F. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 25Lindemann, S., Tolley, N. D., Dixon, D. A., McIntyre, T. M., Prescott, S. M., Zimmerman, G. A., and Weyrich, A. S. (2001)J. Cell Biol., in press.Google Scholar) by αIIbβ3 antagonists may partially explain their clinical efficacy in reducing the severity of arterial restenosis and associated cardiovascular events. Our results also indicate that in addition to transcription and phosphorylation, the functional status of eIF4E is regulated by its intracellular distribution. Spatial targeting of eIF4E to mRNA-rich areas may control translation rates in nucleated cells as well. Translation of mRNA is regulated at multiple checkpoints that allow the cell to precisely control protein synthetic patterns. A prominent level of regulation occurs at the initiation step where eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) catalyze translation. eIF4E is the major rate-limiting initiation factor because it docks the eIF4F complex on the cap structure of the 5′-terminus of virtually all mRNAs. Thus, eIF4E regulates global translation rates in eukaryotic cells. Here we show that mRNAs are associated with the cytoskeletal core of resting platelets, physically separated from eIF4E. Platelet activation redistributes eIF4E to the mRNA-rich cytoskeleton, a process that is required for signal-dependent protein synthesis. αIIbβ3 integrins target eIF4E to these mRNA-rich areas, directly linking this surface receptor to a global translational checkpoint. Our findings emphasize the importance of spatial distribution of eIF4E for optimal protein synthesis, demonstrate the critical role of integrins in mediating this response, and provide further evidence that eIF4E is an important determinant of platelet function (16Rosenwald I.B. Pechet L. Han A. Lu L. Pihan G. Woda B. Chen J.J. Szymanski I. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that platelets synthesize proteins in a signal-dependent fashion (2Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Pabla R. Elstad M.R. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5556-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Because platelets are anucleate cells, these results demonstrated that signals transmitted by αIIbβ3 are linked to translational control pathways. However, little is known about the exact mechanisms by which integrins regulate translational events. Integrin binding can induce the movement of mRNA and ribosomes to focal adhesion complexes that contain specific cytoskeletal components (18Chicurel M.E. Singer R.H. Meyer C.J. Ingber D.E. Nature. 1998; 392: 730-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Gene expression can also be controlled locally by targeting mRNAs to specialized cytoskeletal domains (19Bassell G. Singer R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In resting platelets, we found that the majority of mRNAs are associated with the cytoskeletal core, physically separated from eIF4E. Segregation of the translational machinery in resting platelets provides an explanation for limited constitutive protein synthesis in these cells, as reported by numerous investigators (2Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Pabla R. Elstad M.R. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5556-5561Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 20Booyse F.M. Zschocke D.

Biochem. 1988; 21: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation redistributes β3 integrins and eIF4E to the mRNA-rich cytoskeleton. When cytochalasin D or αIIbβ3antagonists disrupt intracellular trafficking, signal-dependent translation of IL-1β, Bcl-3, and other mRNAs is inhibited (see Fig. 5 and Refs. 1Pabla R. Weyrich A.S. Dixon D.A. Bray P.F. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Zimmerman G.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 175-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar and 25Lindemann, S., Tolley, N. D., Dixon, D. A., McIntyre, T. M., Prescott, S. M., Zimmerman, G. A., and Weyrich, A. S. (2001)J. Cell Biol., in press.Google Scholar). Presumably, this is due to the inability of eIF4E to interact with mRNAs associated with the cytoskeletal core, a hypothesis that is supported by our data demonstrating that inhibition of αIIbβ3-dependent aggregation prevents eIF4E from interacting with a specific mRNA cap homologue. The association of mRNAs with the cytoskeletal core also suggests that the cytoskeleton serves as a scaffold for regulated protein synthesis by platelets. In other cell types, the major sites of translation include the endoplasmic reticulum and the cytoskeleton (22Hovland R. Hesketh J.E. Pryme I.F. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 28: 1089-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Because mature platelets generally do not contain endoplasmic reticulum (23Kieffer N. Guichard J. Farcet J.P. Vainchenker W. Breton-Gorius J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 24Ts'ao C.H. Scand. J. Haematol. 1971; 8: 134-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the cytoskeletal network, which is extensive in platelets, is a logical site for regulated translation. Although not previously considered, our data demonstrate that spatial targeting of eIF4E within cells is an important mechanism that controls eIF4E function. In resting platelets, eIF4E is topographically found in the soluble fraction and the membrane skeleton. The membrane skeleton is a lattice-like structure that coats the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. It is composed of short actin filaments, actin-binding proteins, spectrin, and, vinculin (17Fox J.E.B. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK1996: 217-233Google Scholar). It also contains GPIb-IX, α2β1 (GPIa-IIa), and αIIbβ3 (17Fox J.E.B. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: a Practical Approach.

Using an in vivo approach, we demonstrate an involvement of the two immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecules axonin-1/TAG-1 and F11/F3/contactin in subpopulation-specific sensory axon guidance. Proprioceptive neurons, which establish connections with motoneurons in the ventral horn, depend on F11 interactions. Nociceptive fibers, which target to layers in the dorsal horn, require axonin-1 for pathfinding. In vitro NgCAM and NrCAM were shown to bind to both axonin-1 and F11. However, despite this fact and despite their ubiquitous expression in the spinal cord, NgCAM and NrCAM are selective binding partners for axonin-1 and F11 in sensory axon guidance. Whereas nociceptive pathfinding depends on NgCAM and axonin-1, proprioceptive fibers require NrCAM and F11."

To study this hierarchical organization, we used sparse white noise to map receptive-field substructure (second order Wiener-like kernels) in an extrastriate motion processing area (MT) of alert monkeys. The maps revealed a clear substructure, on a spatial scale comparable to the receptive fields of the V1 inputs. There were both facilitatory and suppressive interactions that differed in spatial organization and time course. Directional interactions were remarkably precise over a very small spatial range, and reversed when successive stimuli reversed contrast––a neural correlate of “reverse phi” motion perception.

https://openalex.org/W2034901222,"Caspase activation and apoptotic volume decrease are fundamental features of programmed cell death; however, the relationship between these components is not well understood. Here we provide biochemical and genetic evidence for the differential involvement of initiator caspases in the apoptotic volume decrease during both intrinsic and extrinsic activation of apoptosis. Apoptosis induction in Jurkat T lymphocytes by Fas receptor engagement (intrinsic) or ultraviolet (UV)-C radiation (extrinsic) triggered the loss of cell volume, which was restricted to cells with diminished intracellular K(+) ions. These characteristics kinetically coincided with the proteolytic processing and activation of both initiator and effector caspases. Although the polycaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone completely inhibited the Fas-mediated apoptotic volume decrease and K(+) efflux, it was much less effective in preventing these processes during UV-induced cell death under conditions whereby caspase activities and DNA degradation were blocked. To define the roles of specific initiator caspases, we utilized Jurkat cells genetically deficient in caspase-8 or stably transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of caspase-9. The results show that the activation of caspase-8, but not caspase-9, is necessary for Fas-induced apoptosis. Conversely, caspase-9, but not caspase-8, is important for UV-mediated shrunken morphology and apoptosis progression. Together, these findings indicate that cell shrinkage and K(+) efflux during apoptosis are tightly coupled, but are differentially regulated by either caspase-8 or caspase-9 depending on specific pathways of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2041081518,"Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P2) mediates cell motility and changes in cell shape in response to extracellular stimuli. In platelets, it is synthesized from PI4P by PIP5K in response to stimulation of a G-protein-coupled receptor by an agonist, such as the thrombin. In the present study, we have addressed the pathway that induces PIP5K Iα activation following the addition of thrombin. Under resting condition expressed PIP5K Iα was predominantly localized in a perinuclear distribution. After stimulation of the thrombin receptor, PAR1, or overexpression of a constitutively active variant of Gαq, PIP5K Iα translocated to the plasma membrane. Movement of PIP5K Iα to the cell membrane was dependent on both GTP-bound Rac and Rho, but not Arf, because: 1) inactive GDP-bound variants of either Rac or Rho blocked the translocation induced by constitutively active Gαq, 2) constitutively GTP-bound active variants of Rac or Rho induced PIP5K Iα translocation in the absence of other stimuli, and 3) constitutively active variants of Arf1 or Arf6 failed to induce membrane translocation of PIP5K Iα. In addition, a dominant negative variant of Rho blocked the PIP5K Iα membrane translocation induced by constitutively active Rac, whereas dominant negative variants of either Rac or Arf6 failed to block PIP5K Iα membrane translocation induced by constitutively active Rho. This implies that the effect on PIP5K Iα by Rac is indirect, and requires the activation of Rho. In contrast to the findings with PIP5K Iα, the related lipid kinase PIP4K failed to undergo translocation after stimulation by small GTP-binding proteins Rac or Rho. We also tested whether membrane localization of PIP5K Iα correlated with an increase in its lipid kinase activity and found that co-expressing of PIP5K Iα with either constitutively active Gαq, Rac, or Rho led to a 5- to 7-fold increase in PIP5K Iα activity. Thus, these findings suggest that stimulation of a G-protein-coupled receptor (PAR1) leads to the sequential activation of Gαq, Rac, Rho, and PIP5K Iα. Once activated and translocated to the cell membrane, PIP5K Iα becomes available to phosphorylate PI4P to generate PI4,5P2 on the plasma membrane.

In mammalian cells, PI4,5P2 is synthesized by two different pathways. The first involves a phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase type I (PIP5K I) isoform, which phosphorylates the substrate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) at the d-5 position of the inositol ring (16Rameh L.E.

It is currently thought the pathway utilizing PIP5K I (α, β, or γ isoform) is the predominant mechanism of PI4,5P2 synthesis in mammalian cells and, therefore, is a major regulator of actin organization, secretion, and endocytosis (19Lassing I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). For example, only PIP5K I requires phosphatidic acid as a cofactor for maximal activity (24Moritz A.

In contrast, Tolias et al. (34Tolias K.F. Hartwig J.H. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) showed that the addition of recombinant Rac to permeabilized platelets led to PIP5K Iα activation and PI4,5P2 production. Therefore, it appears that small GTP-binding proteins affect PIP5K I activity and PI4,5P2production. However, it is unclear which GTPase is predominantly responsible. Both PIP5K I and PIP4K appear to localize to distinct subcellular compartments. PIP5K Iα has been reported to specifically localize at the plasma membranes or in the nucleus, whereas PIP4K has been reported to be present diffusely within the cell or to be present in the ER, actin cytoskeleton, cytosol, plasma membrane, or nucleus (35Shibasaki Y.

We asked whether localization of PIP5K Iα played a role in its regulation, because its only known substrates are membrane-bound phospholipids. In the present study, we demonstrate that stimulation of the PAR1 receptor induces a translocation of PIP5K Iα from the Golgi to the cell membrane. This process involves heterotrimeric G-proteins as well as both Rac and Rho, but not Arf. Coincident with the intracellular translocation of PIP5K Iα, we found that its enzymatic activity increased 5- to 7-fold when co-expressed with either large or small GTP-binding proteins. Therefore, these results delineate a signaling pathway that is initiated by a G-protein-coupled receptor and leads to the production of PI4,5P2.

Alexa 350, the cascade blue-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, and Alexa 546, the red dye-conjugated streptavidin were purchased from Molecular Probes. The PI4P was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and all remaining chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The human PIP5K Iα cDNA was generated by PCR using EST AA054379 (Genome Systems) as template and the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CG CCA GGA TCC GCC ACC ATG TCT TCT GCT GCT GAA-3′ and 5′-GG CGC TCT AGA TTA CAA GTC TTC TTC AGA AAT CAA CTT TTG TTC TAA ATA GAC GTC AAG CAC-3′. The primers incorporated BamHI and XbaI sites, as well as a carboxyl-terminal myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL). This product was cloned into BglII- and XbaI-digested pCMV5 (a gift of Mark Stinski, University of Iowa). Cloning of PIP4K (also known as PIP5K Type II or Type C) was performed by PCR using EST W00481 from Genome Systems. Full-length sequencing revealed that two nucleotide changes that differed from the published sequence, and altered the predicted translated product from101CGK103 to 101LRE103and V109 to D. These substitutions likely represent polymorphisms, because multiple independent EST clones (N28765, N33825, and THC154497) contained the identical sequence. The cDNA was amplified using PCR primers CG GCA G GTA CCG GCC ATG GCG ACC CCC GGC and GG CGC TCT AGA TTA CAA GTC TTC TTC AGA AAT CAA CTT TTG TTC CGT CAA GAT GTG GCC AAT, which incorporated an myc-epitope onto the carboxyl terminus and KpnI andXbaI restriction sites to facilitate cloning into pCMV5.

Human Embryonic Kidney HEK 293T and Cos-7 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) were transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate technique using a total of 4 μg of plasmid per 30-mm tissue culture dish. Care was always taken to include empty vector to some transfections to allow identical quantities of plasmid to be used in every transfection. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was removed and replaced with a fresh medium, and analyzed after an additional 24 h. All cells were grown at 37 °C in the presence of 5% of CO2. Transiently transfected Cos-7 cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 10% Buffered Formalin Acetate (Fisher Scientific) for 30 min, rinsed again twice with PBS, and then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100-containing PBS for 10 min. Cells were double-stained with a polyclonal anti-myc epitope antibody and a monoclonal antibody directed against either PAR1 (WEDE15), γ-adaptin (a Golgi protein), or the HA-epitope (12CA5). Anti-myc was visualized by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. Anti-PAR1, -adaptin, or -HA was identified by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. For the triple staining, cells were first stained with monoclonal anti-HA followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. The cells were then incubated with polyclonal anti-myc and biotinylated monoclonal anti-FLAG IgG1 (M2) antibodies, followed by staining with the cascade blue-labeled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody along with Alexa 546-conjugated streptavidin. Localization experiments were performed a minimum of three times, and ∼30–60 cells per experiment were examined by two or more viewers. Confocal micrographs of at least six to eight representative cells of each experimental condition were performed by the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center Confocal Microscopy Core Facility. Confocal images were acquired from a TCS 4D Upright microscope and processed on an IBM OS9 workstation, using Scanware software. After transient transfection, 10-cm tissue culture plastic dishes of confluent HEK 293T cells were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed with 1 ml buffer A (1% Triton X-100; 0.14 m NaCl; 1 mmMgCl2; 1 mm EGTA; 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 mmNa3VO4, and 50 mm NaF). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed using 9E10, a monoclonal antibody against the myc epitope. The immune complexes are collected on protein G-Sepharose, washed twice with buffer A, three times with the kinase buffer B (40 mm HEPES, 20 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol) and subjected to immunoblotting and kinase lipid assay. A standard assay for phosphorylation of PI4P was carried out in an incubation medium of 80 μl of buffer B containing 125 μm ATP, 125 μm PI4P, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The enzyme reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. After stopping the reaction with 1 m HCl (2 volumes) and extracting the lipids with an equal volume of chloroform-methanol (1:1, v/v), the32P-labeled PI4,5P2 products were resolved by thin-layer chromatography using water-chlorophorm-methanol-NH4OH (25:70:100:15, v/v) as a solvent system. Immediately before chromatography, the thin-layer plates were precoated with 1% potassium oxalate in water-methanol (1:1) and baked at 110 °C for 35 min. Unlabeled PI4P and PI4,5P2 standards were run in parallel to samples to monitor lipid migration and were visualized by exposure to iodine vapor. The regions of the TLC plates that contained PI4,5P2spots were carefully excised, placed in a screw-capped scintillation vial, and then subjected to scintillation counting. Counts were normalized for immunoprecipitated myc-PIP5K Iα as determined by quantitative 125I-immunoblotting. Previous reports demonstrated that stimulation of the predominant thrombin receptor on human platelet, PAR1, leads to an increase in PI4,5P2 synthesis (41Grondin P. Plantavid M. Sultan C. Breton M.

Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Using Cos-7 cells transfected with tagged PIP5K, we investigated whether stimulation of this G-protein-coupled receptor was also associated with an intracellular redistribution of PIP5K Iα. Under resting conditions, expressed PIP5K Iα was located adjacent to the cell nucleus (Fig. 1). Because of the eccentric perinuclear distribution, we simultaneously co-stained cells with antibodies against the Golgi marker, adaptin, as well as the epitope tag on PIP5K Iα. We found that resting PIP5K Iα localized in proximity with γ-adaptin (Fig. 1). Confocal microscopy verified this localization and showed that PIP5K Iα colocalized most closely with a marker of the cis-Golgi cisternae, GM-130 (Fig.2 A). Thus, under resting conditions, PIP5K Iα is co-localized within the earlytrans-Golgi network. It should be noted that the Golgi has previously been described to contain PIP5K I activity (43Godi A.

A, Cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with myc epitope-tagged PIP5K Iα and stained with polyclonal anti-myc (green) and monoclonal anti-GM130 (red). Shown is an overlay confocal micrograph demonstrating that unstimulated PIP5K Iα localizes with GM130. B, Cos-7 cells were transiently transfected with myc epitope-tagged PIP5K Iα along with constitutively active HA-tagged Gαq. The cells were fixed and stained with both polyclonal anti-myc and monoclonal anti-HA. Shown is an overlay confocal image of anti-myc (red) and anti-HA (green) staining. This demonstrates that active Gαq stimulates PIP5K Iα to localize on the cell membrane.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next tested whether stimulation of the PAR1 thrombin receptor would alter the location of PIP5K Iα. As shown in Fig.3, stimulation of PAR1 with the receptor-specific activating peptide SFLLRN resulted in the translocation of PIP5K Iα to the cellular membrane. After 1 h of stimulation with the peptide agonist, 30–40% of cells redistributed PIP5K Iα toward their plasma membrane. Additional studies using transfected HEK-293 cells yielded the same result (not shown). Therefore, these data indicate that stimulation of the thrombin receptor initiates a signaling cascade that can induce the movement of PIP5K Iα toward the cell membrane. PAR1 is typically coupled to phospholipase C by Gαq. To determine whether PAR1 mediated its affect on the intracellular distribution of PIP5K Iα via Gαq, we tested whether the relocalization of PIP5K Iα could be mimicked by co-expression of PIP5K Iα with an active variant of the α subunit. The Q209L mutation in Gαq (HA-Gαq Q209L) is constitutively in the GTP-bound state. In 100% of cells expressing Gαq Q209L and PIP5K Iα, PIP5K Iα was easily identified as being associated with the cell membrane (Fig.4). Confocal microscopy of cells expressing active Gαq and PIP5K Iα, verified PIP5K Iα was present on the cell membrane (Fig. 2 B). Although these confocal images revealed that the majority of PIP5K Iα was now on the cell membrane, in some cells a fraction of PIP5K Iα was still localized with the Golgi. These results indicate that the subcellular distribution of the PIP5K Iα can be regulated by the thrombin receptor and at least one of the G-proteins which normally associate with it. We also found that stimulation of the EGF receptor by 1-h stimulation of 25 ng/ml EGF initiated cell membrane association of PIP5K Iα (data not shown). This demonstrates that the relocalization of PIP5K Iα is not limited to stimulation of a G-protein-coupled receptor. In addition, we have found that expressed PIP5K Iα in Jurkat T-cells has a perinuclear distribution when the cells are plated on poly-l-lysine. However, PIP5K Iα translocates to the cellular membrane when the cells are plated on either fibronectin or C305 (an IgM antibody that binds and activates the T-cell antigen receptor). This implies that the signaling pathway leading to membrane association of PIP5K Iα ultimately involves effectors common to multiple receptor families, including G-protein-coupled, growth factor, immunoglobulin supergene, and integrin receptors. Although there is agreement that low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins contribute to PIP5K Iα activation, the identity of the relevant proteins is controversial. Because the low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins Rac and Rho become activated after stimulation of G-protein-coupled, growth factor, immunoglobulin supergene, and integrin receptors (42Hartwig J.H.

Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar), we tested whether the membrane localization of PIP5K Iα could be influenced by these proteins. As shown in Fig. 5, when PIP5K Iα was co-expressed along with constitutively GTP-bound variants of Rac (Rac L61) or Rho (Rho L63), PIP5K Iα was recruited from the Golgi to the cellular membrane in 100% of cells. This effect by Rac or Rho was regulated by the nucleotide-bound state, because overexpression of constitutively GDP-bound variants of either Rac (Rac V12N17) or Rho (Rho N19) failed to induce the PIP5K Iα translocation (Fig. 5). Arf is another low molecular weight GTP-binding protein that has been shown to interact in vitro with PIP5K Iα. In contrast to the effect of Rac and Rho on PIP5K Iα intracellular localization, we found that neither constitutively GTP-bound variant of Arf1 (Fig. 5) or Arf6 (not shown) induced PIP5K Iα translocation. Therefore, this demonstrates that Rac and Rho, but not Arf, are capable of inducing membrane translocation of PIP5K Iα. This also shows that PIP5K translocation is regulated by which guanine nucleotide is bound to the low molecular weight GTP-binding protein. Because PIP4K has also been reported to become stimulated after thrombin stimulation of platelets (38Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6516-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), we next tested whether small GTP-binding proteins also affected the intracellular distribution of this lipid kinase. In contrast to our findings with PIP5K Iα, neither the GTP- nor GDP-bound variants of Rac or Rho affected the localization of PIP4K (Fig. 6). Therefore, these observations suggest that, although Rac and Rho can contribute to the membrane localization of PIP5K Iα, they have no effect on the intracellular distribution of PIP4K. Because activation of both high, and low, molecular weight GTP-binding proteins lead to the translocation of PIP5K Iα, we examined whether they are components of the same signaling pathway. To begin to address this question, we tested whether dominant negative variants of Rac or Rho affected the ability of Gαq to induce membrane association of PIP5K Iα. As shown in Fig. 7, GDP-bound variants of either Rac or Rho functioned as competitive inhibitors (dominant negatives) and blocked the ability of Gαq to induce cell mem"

Using high-resolution imaging of dendritic spines of green-fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing, patch-clamped hippocampal neurons in dissociated culture, we find that bursts of action potentials, evoked by depolarizing current pulses, cause momentary contractions of dendritic spines. Blocking calcium currents with cobalt prevented these twitches. In additional experiments with neurons loaded via a micropipette with calcium-sensitive and insensitive dyes, spontaneous calcium transients were associated with a rapid contraction of the spine head. The spine twitch was prolonged by tetraethylammonium or bicuculline, which enhance calcium transients, and was blocked by the actin polymerization antagonist latrunculin-B. The spine twitch may be instrumental in modulating reactivity of the NMDA receptor to afferent stimulation, following back-propagating action potentials."

Mutant analysis suggests that the response regulator Pos9p is involved in mitigating self-inflicted oxidative damages in G0 cells, whereas Yap1p is primarily required in growing cells. The data also suggest that oxidation of target proteins is not a priori an effect of arrest of cell division or nutrient depletion and cannot be explained by the respiratory activity alone nor a high ratio of catabolic/anabolic activity in G0 cells. Instead, we observed that starvation elicits a transition in the respiratory state (from phosphorylating to nonphosphorylating respiration) and that this transition is associated with a stepwise increase in protein oxidation. During carbon starvation, this transition and increase in oxidation occurs immediately as the carbon source is depleted, growth is arrested, and the respiratory rate falls drastically. In contrast, during nitrogen starvation and excess carbon the respiratory state transition and stepwise increase in protein oxidation are markedly delayed and occur long after the nitrogen source has been depleted and division and growth-arrested. Oxidation in G0 cells could be enhanced by treating cells with low concentrations of antimycin A and attenuated with myxothiazol, indicating that protein oxidation is intimately linked to reactive oxygen species generated by semiquinones of the Q-cycle.

Denham Harman was perhaps the first to suggest that free radicals produced during aerobic respiration cause cumulative oxidative damage, resulting in aging and death (1Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6391) Google Scholar). The theory gained in credibility with the identification of superoxide dismutase, which provided compelling evidence of in vivo generation of superoxide anions (2McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hypothesis has later been supported by different experimental data demonstrating that levels of oxidatively damaged macromolecules, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, increase with age in all species examined so far and that oxidatively modified proteins lose their catalytic activity and structural integrity. In addition, support of the theory comes from experiments in which the life span of fruit flies was prolonged by overproducing antioxidants (3Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar), and recent identification of gerontogenes (genes whose alteration causes life extension) in Caenorhabditis elegans further supports the notion of a strong correlation between longevity and oxidative stress defense. In addition, the life span of resting unicellular microbes, such as Escherichia coli (4Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) andSaccharomyces cerevisiae (5Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), appears to be limited by the cell's ability to combat reactive oxygen species (ROS)1.The causal factors behind the increased levels of oxidized macromolecules in resting and aging cells is a key question that has not been resolved. Some attempts have been made to correlate oxidation in aging cells with a reduced activity (or abundance) of the antioxidant defense and repair systems (or proteases involved in degradation of oxidized proteins) (6Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, these attempts have generated conflicting results. For example, catalases have been demonstrated to either increase or decrease with age depending on the tissues analyzed (7Sohal R.S. Agarwal S. Sohal B.H. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1995; 81: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and in other studies it has been demonstrated that some antioxidant defense proteins may increase, while others decrease, with age in the same tissues (8Ji L.L. Dillon D. Wu E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R386-R392PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, as pointed out by Beckman and Ames (9Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3094) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether an elevated abundance of an antioxidant defense system in any given cell indicates that there will be less oxidative damage in this cell or that it is experiencing an increasing oxidative load. In prokaryotic model systems, such asE. coli, it is known that the levels of both primary and secondary oxidative defense proteins increase markedly during growth arrest and that the population becomes increasingly resistant to external oxidative stresses (10Nyström T. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 927-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Eisenstark A. Calcutt M.J. Becker-Hapak M. Ivanova A. Free Radic. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26027-26032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar).Apart from these difficulties, the notion that increased oxidation in aging cells is due to a diminished ability of the defense systems to counteract such oxidation raises the question of why such systems then fail to function in resting or old cells. The suggestion that this is primarily due to free radicals and oxidative damage is, of course, a circular argument. Two alternative possibilities are that (i) the respiratory apparatus, or other enzymatic activities, has an increased tendency to generate ROS during growth arrest or that (ii) the levels of oxidized proteins increase in resting and nongrowing cells simply due to the fact that such cells have an ongoing respiratory activity but little or no ability to dilute damaged proteins with sufficient levels of de novo macromolecular synthesis. The latter model thus points to the possibility that the lack of self-replacement in a metabolically active aerobic system causes an unavoidable increase in oxidatively damaged cell constituents. In this work, we have approached these possibilities by using G0 cells of S. cerevisiae as a model system for studying oxidation in cells entering a resting state. We established that these cells could be used to study stasis-induced oxidation by demonstrating that the level of carbonylated proteins markedly increases as a result of starvation-induced growth arrest inS. cerevisiae similar to starving E. coli cells and aging eukaryotes. The response regulator, Pos9p, appears to be specifically involved in reducing self-inflicted oxidation in G0 cells, whereas the Yap1p regulator is more important during growth. In addition, we used different batch and fed-batch cultivation systems in combination with on-line measurements of metabolic activities to show that oxidation of proteins is not a priori caused by growth arrest and a high respiratory activity in nongrowing cells. Nor is oxidation an immediate effect of the lack of a growth-supporting nutrient. Instead, we found that a shift in the state of respiration to one in which the mitochondrial ATPase is no longer working during stasis is intimately associated with an increase in the oxidation of target proteins. This is the first demonstration that state transitions occurs in vivo during growth arrest and that such transitions are associated with increased oxidative damage. In summary, our data favor the model that stasis increases the tendency of the respiratory apparatus to generate ROS and that this tendency may be linked to stasis-induced alterations in the functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation. We discuss how such a reduced phosphorylation may generate ROS in view of existing data concerning respiratory state transitions in isolated mitochondria.DISCUSSIONS. cerevisiae has been used as a model system for studying two different aspects of cellular senescence. One aspect concerns replicative senescence, i.e. the mandatory loss of replicative ability after a certain number of successive doublings, which, in yeast, appears to be dictated by genome instability, specifically in the ribosomal DNA (32Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell. 1997; 91: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). The other aspect concerns the loss of reproductive ability of cells subjected to growth arrest in stationary phase. It has been suggested that such stationary phase yeast cells may be a model system for aging of somatic cells of higher eukaryotic multicellular organisms (5Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 6Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This argument is based on the fact that stationary phase yeast cells resemble somatic cells in two important aspects: (i) they have exited the cell cycle and entered the G0 phase, and (ii) most of their energy comes from mitochondrial respiration (5Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The life span of such G0 cells has been suggested to be intimately linked to mitochondrial respiration and cellular management of ROS (5Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 6Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), whereas the effect of ROS on replicative senescence remains a controversial issue (33Barker M.G. Brimage L.J. Smart K.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 177: 199-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lin S.J. Defossez P.A. Guarente L. Science. 2000; 289: 2126-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar).The role of oxidative damage leading to loss of viability of G0 cells is based upon results demonstrating that mutant cells lacking either copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, manganese superoxide dismutase, or both lost culturability at an accelerated rate in stationary phase (5Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 6Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). This is similar to results obtained with superoxide dismutase mutants of E. coli (12Dukan S. Nyström T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26027-26032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 35Benov L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 322: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, from these results we cannot make the assumption that the life span of wild-type cells is restricted by oxidative damage; they only demonstrate that superoxide dismutase mutants are worse off in stationary phase than their wild-type counterpart. In this paper, we approached this problem by directly measuring oxidative damage to proteins in wild-type yeast cells entering the G0 phase due to nutrient starvation. We used an immunological assay for the detection of protein carbonylation, which is an irreversible and highly deleterious oxidative modification of proteins (36Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20313-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2762) Google Scholar). As demonstrated, we obtained direct evidence for an increased oxidative damage with the age of G0 cells, supporting previous conclusions (5Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12275-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). It should be noted also that it has been demonstrated previously that the levels of carbonylation in yeast cells starved for 5 days are lower than in cells starved for 3 month (37Jakubowski W. Bilinski T. Bartosz G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Additionally, we found that, in contrast to the wild-type strain, pos9 mutants were unable to decrease the level of oxidized proteins in the G0 state, whereas yap1 mutants showed a higher level of oxidized proteins only during the exponential growth phase. The Yap1 and Pos9 transcription factors have been demonstrated to control the expression of several common genes, such as TRX2 and TRR1(18Morgan B.A. Banks G.R. Toone W.M. Raitt D. Kuge S. Johnston L.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1035-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and the redundancy of these systems has been left without any convincing explanation apart from the fact that cadmium resistance seems to be specifically controlled by Yap1p (20Lee J. Godon C. Lagniel G. Spector D. Garin J. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16040-16046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The data presented here, however, indicate that the role of these systems in protecting the cell against self-inflicted oxidation is distinct and intimately linked to different phases of growth of the culture. Specifically, the Pos9 system is involved in protection against oxidative injuries in the G0 phase, whereas the Yap1 system is more important during growth.Based on our results, we argue that G0 cells of yeast might be an excellent and convenient model system to approaching the free radical hypothesis of aging. Specifically, we were interested in the causal factors behind the apparently universal increase in oxidized macromolecules in aging cells and whether the “rate of living” hypothesis (38Pearl R. The Rate of Living. Alfred Knopf, New York1928: 183-185Google Scholar) could help explaining this oxidation in G0cells. It has been observed that there is an apparent correlation between species-specific metabolic rate and life span, such that species with lower metabolic rates consume less O2 per gram of tissue and have a longer maximum life span potential. Moreover, a factor called the “life energy potential,” defined as the product of the specific metabolic rate and the maximum life span potential, has been argued to be more or less constant for all species. Therefore, it has been proposed that the rate of energy consumption is a priori responsible for senescence (39Rubner M. Das Problem der Lebensdauer und Seine Beziehungen zum Wachstum under Ehrnarung. Oldenburg, Munich, Germany1908: 150-204Google Scholar), and this concept is referred to as the rate of living hypothesis (38Pearl R. The Rate of Living. Alfred Knopf, New York1928: 183-185Google Scholar, 40Sohal R.S. Gerontology. 1976; 22: 317-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). With the demonstration that respiring mitochondria generate ROS (25Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar), an updated version of the hypothesis states that a faster rate of respiration hastens aging by the greater generation of oxygen radicals. The rate of living hypothesis has, in this form, essentially merged with the free radical hypothesis of aging (9Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3094) Google Scholar, 41Beckman K.B. A. B.N. Scandalios J. Oxidative Stress and the Molecular Biology of Antioxidant Defenses: Oxidants, Antioxidants, and Aging. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 201-246Google Scholar).When applied to G0 cells, the hypothesis could explain increased oxidation of proteins in resting and nongrowing cells simply due to the fact that such cells have an ongoing respiratory activity but little or no ability to replace damaged proteins. In addition, the prediction of the hypothesis is that the higher the rate of respiration, the greater the oxidation damages and the shorter the life spans. As shown here, our data do not support such a model; no strict correlation between respiratory activity and protein oxidation was found when using different starvation conditions to induce a G0 state. Instead, we demonstrate that a stepwise increase in protein oxidation occurs when the metabolic activity reaches exceedingly low levels. In addition, this elevation of carbonyl levels occurs concomitantly with a respiratory state transition (the RSV drops to 0), and at this time, and subsequently, ATPase inhibitors (e.g. TET) could no longer inhibit respiration. We believe that these results favor the hypothesis that mitochondria and the respiratory apparatus have an increased tendency to generate ROS during growth arrest, which may be linked to a respiratory state transition rather than to the rate of metabolism per se.The state transition of G0 cells appears to be a consequence of a drastically reduced activity of the oxidative phosphorylation as inferred from results showing that TET failed to reduce respiratory activity as the G0 cells progressed into stationary phase. Moreover, CCCP addition markedly increased respiration of TET-treated cells, demonstrating that the G0cells were not depleted for reducing equivalents and that the membrane potential was retained. A key question that arises from these observations is why the ATPase appears to be so tightly regulated in starved cells. Since the potential still exists (CCCP stimulates respiration), the most obvious explanation is that the ATP/(ADP + Pi) ratio is too high for the ATPase to function, a situation that would mimic a classical state transition in experiments with isolated mitochondria. However, the ATP/(ADP + Pi) ratio is not known, because measurements of the in vivomitochondrial pools of ATP, ADP, and inorganic phosphate (Pi) are, as far as we know, technically impossible to perform. Another possibility is a mechanistic change of the ATPase itself that would affect its kinetic properties. This could be due to age-related damage. However, if the ATPase activity is reduced due to a starvation-induced damage, we have to hypothesize that this damage occurs immediately as cells deplete their carbon source (in contrast to nitrogen starved cells), and this seems unlikely in view of the fact that carbon-starved cells recover their respiratory activity immediately when carbon is added back to the culture. Finally, an allosteric change of the ATPase could also change its properties. Present studies are aimed at approaching the possibilities discussed and to understand the primary cause for the state transition observed in G0 cells.Other questions concern how and why a state transition escalates ROS production and oxidative damage. On isolated mitochondria, a state transition (from state 3 to state 4) occurs when the ADP is depleted, which results in an increase in the membrane potential and a reduced electron flow through the respiratory chain (26Fitton V. Rigoulet M. Ouhabi R. Guerin B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9692-9698Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In addition, direct measurements of ROS generation on isolated mitochondria from pigeon and rat demonstrated that this reaches maximal levels during a state 4 respiration (25Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the increase in the membrane potential associated with a state 4 respiration is causing an increased generation of ROS (42Papa S. Skulachev V.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), and Korshunov et al. (24Korshunov S.S. Skulachev V.P. Starkov A.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 15-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1367) Google Scholar) have shown a direct relationship between hydrogen peroxide production and the value of the membrane potential. However, the elevated membrane potential is intimately associated with a reduced flow of electrons during a state 4 respiration, and it is difficult to distinguish which of these two factors would have the greatest impact on the generation of ROS. In addition, it has not been established that the results concerning ROS production, membrane potential, and electron flow in isolated mitochondria are applicable to intact cells studied in vivo. The data presented here suggest that a state 4-like respiration affects the degree of oxidative damage in intact yeast cells. Therefore, our results are in line with the conclusions fromin vitro experiments.According to Skulachev's hypothesis (30Skulachev V.P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 169-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cytochromeb L is highly reduced in state 4, since its oxidation to cytochrome b H is prevented by a high membrane potential. In view of the fact that semiquinones (CoQ⨪) are being oxidized to CoQ by cytochromeb L, a state 4 could then lead to a long-lived form of semiquinones (CoQ⨪), which can, by reacting with molecular oxygen, generate superoxide ions (O⨪2). The oxidation observed in intact G0 cells was enhanced by treating cells with low concentrations of antimycin A and attenuated with myxothiazol, indicating that protein oxidation is linked to ROS generated by CoQ⨪ of the Q-cycle. These data suggest that the redox status of the quinone pool is directly related to the level of oxidative damage in the cell. This is in line with the suggestion that the CoQ⨪ acts as an intermediate between a high potential and superoxide production. It should be noted, however, that we describe an in vivo pseudo state 4, and this state may not share all the characteristics of the traditional state 4 as defined for isolated mitochondria. Assuming a mechanistic link between electron flow and membrane potential (25Boveris A. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1973; 134: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (2076) Google Scholar), it is likely, however, that a pseudostate 4 is indeed associated with a high membrane potential alsoin vivo.In summary, we have established distinctive, growth phase-dependent assignments of the Pos9 and Yap1 transcription factors in protecting the cells against self-inflicted oxidation, and we demonstrate for the first time a link between nonphosphorylating respiration and protein oxidation in vivoand show that the ROS production system responds to the state of respiration regardless of the respiratory rate. We put forward the hypothesis that the redox state of the quinones is the intermediate step between a high membrane potential, ROS production, and oxidative damage to proteins and that the state, rather than the rate of respiration, dictates the degree of self-inflicted damage in growth-arrested yeast cells. It has been proposed that aging results from random deleterious events, and oxidative damage has been suggested to be one major contributor to such stochastic degeneration of organisms and their cells. Denham Harman was perhaps the first to suggest that free radicals produced during aerobic respiration cause cumulative oxidative damage, resulting in aging and death (1Harman D. J. Gerontol. 1956; 11: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (6391) Google Scholar). The theory gained in credibility with the identification of superoxide dismutase, which provided compelling evidence of in vivo generation of superoxide anions (2McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hypothesis has later been supported by different experimental data demonstrating that levels of oxidatively damaged macromolecules, including DNA, proteins, and lipids, increase with age in all species examined so far and that oxidatively modified proteins lose their catalytic activity and structural integrity. In addition, support of the theory comes from experiments in which the life span of fruit flies was prolonged by overproducing antioxidants (3Orr W.C. Sohal R.S. Science. 1994; 263: 1128-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar), and recent identification of gerontogenes (genes whose alteration causes life extension) in Caenorhabditis elegans further supports the notion of a strong correlation between longevity and oxidative stress defense. In addition, the life span of resting unicellular microbes, such as Escherichia coli (4Dukan S. Nyström T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3431-3441Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) andSaccharomyces cerevisiae (5Longo V.D. Gralla E.B. Valentine J.S. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), appears to be limited by the cell's ability to combat reactive oxygen species (ROS)1. The causal factors behind the increased levels of oxidized macromolecules in resting and aging cells is a key question that has not been resolved. Some attempts have been made to correlate oxidation in aging cells with a reduced activity (or abundance) of the antioxidant defense and repair systems (or proteases involved in degradation of oxidized proteins) (6Longo V.D. Liou L.L. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, these attempts have generated conflicting results. For example, catalases have been demonstrated to either increase or decrease with age depending on the tissues analyzed (7Sohal R.S. Agarwal S. Sohal B.H. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1995; 81: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and in other studies it has been demonstrated that some antioxidant defense proteins may increase, while others decrease, with age in the same tissues (8Ji L.L. Dillon D. Wu E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: R386-R392PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, as pointed out by Beckman and Ames (9Beckman K.B. Ames B.N. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 547-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3094) Google Scholar), it is not clear whether an elevated abundance of an antioxidant defense system in any given cell indicates that there will be less oxidative damage in this cell or that it is experiencing an increasing oxidative load. In prokaryotic model systems, such asE. coli, it is known that the levels of both primary and secondary oxidative defense proteins increase markedly during growth arrest and that the population becomes increasingly resistant to external oxidative stresses (10Nyström T. Neidhardt F.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 927-930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Eisenstark A. Calcutt M.J. Becker-Hapak M. Ivanova A. Free Radic. Biol.

Its four known isoforms are found in many exocytotically active cell types including various endo- and exocrine cells, adipocytes, egg cells, mammary epithelial cells, and osteoclasts, in association with secretory granules and other intracellular membranes. Rab3A and Rab3C, in particular, are highly expressed in neurons and are associated with the membranes of synaptic neurotransmitter vesicles. In isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes), Rab3A and Rab3C undergo cycles of GTP/GDP conversion and of membrane association/dissociation concurrent with the life cycle of synaptic vesicles (4Fischer von Mollard G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. Nature. 1991; 349: 79-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 5Fischer von Mollard G. Stahl B. Khokhlatchev A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Biol.

Different types of experiments in a number of endocrine and neuronal cell types indicate that Rab3 acts as a GTP-dependent negative regulator of Ca2+-stimulated exocytosis (see Ref. 7Chung S.H.

The Rab3A knockout phenotype is relatively subtle, suggesting that Rab3A is not essential for neurotransmitter exocytosis, but it is possible that the B, C, or D isoforms partially compensate for the lack of Rab3A. The molecular mechanisms of action of Rab3 are poorly understood, but they are thought to involve effector proteins that interact specifically with GTP-saturated Rab3. At least two such proteins have been identified: rabphilin-3 and Rim. Rabphilin-3 dissociates from synaptic vesicles concurrently with Rab3A (12Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R.

However, mutations either in Rab3A or in rabphilin-3 that abolish direct binding between the two proteins do not impair the inhibition of exocytosis by Rab3A (7Chung S.H. Joberty G. Gelino E.A.

Moreover, rabphilin-3 knockout mice display no detectable phenotype; in particular, they do not exhibit the phenomena observed in Rab3A knockout mice (18Schlüter O.M. Schnell E. Verhage M.

Therefore, the mechanistic role of rabphilin-3 in the neurotransmitter vesicle life cycle and particularly in relation to Rab3 remains unclear. Rim, with two known isoforms, Rim1 (19Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) and Rim2 (20Wang Y. Sugita S. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), is firmly associated with the release site of neurotransmitter vesicles, the active zone of the synapse. Its N-terminal region binds GTP-complexed Rab3A and Rab3C, so that Rim may target and tether synaptic vesicles to their release sites through Rab3. Rims are large (1250–1600-amino acid) multidomain proteins containing zinc finger, PDZ, and C2 modules and are subject to extensive structural variation by differential splicing and alternative promoter choice (20Wang Y. Sugita S. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20033-20044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Related domain architectures with N-terminal double zinc fingers and two C-terminal C2 domains are also found in rabphilin-3 and in another active zone-associated protein named aczonin (21Wang X. Kibschull M. Laue M.M. Lichte B. Petrasch-Parwez E. Kilimann M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), alias piccolo (22Fenster S.D. Chung W.J. Zhai R.

Aczonin, like Rim, also possesses a PDZ domain upstream of the C2 domains. To understand how these putative effector proteins act in concert with Rab3 in the orchestration of neurotransmitter vesicle dynamics, it is necessary to define their functional domains and the interactions of these domains within each protein and with Rab3 and other binding partners. Large multidomain proteins anchored at the active zone, like Rim and aczonin, probably function as scaffolds for the ordered assembly of multiprotein complexes involved in vesicle trafficking. In rabphilin-3, a sequence region surrounding the zinc finger (amino acids 45–161) has been defined as the Rab3A-GTP binding domain. The rabphilin-3 zinc finger module itself does not contact Rab3A in the crystal structure (23Ostermeier C. Brünger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), but it seems to be necessary to uphold the binding configuration because mutations of zinc-coordinating cysteine residues severely impair Rab3A binding (12Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 24McKiernan C.J. Stabila P.F. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4985-4994Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated which parts of the N-terminal region of Rim1 are involved in the GTP-stimulated binding of Rab3. We find that a short α-helical sequence near the Rim1 N terminus, distantly similar to an α-helical sequence in the Rab3A-binding domain of rabphilin-3, is sufficient for high affinity, GTP-dependent, direct and specific binding of Rab3. Full-length coding sequences of Rab proteins, from codon 2 to the stop codon, were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from mouse brain RNA and inserted into the SmaI site of the His tag vector pQE32 (Qiagen). The following reference sequences were used: Rab3A (accession number NM_009001), Rab3D (AF263365), Rab4 (D86563), Rab7 (NM_009005), Rab8 (S53279), and Rab11A (NM_017382), all from mouse. The mouse Rab3C cDNA sequence was newly determined after reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using an N-terminal primer based on the rat Rab3C cDNA (D78197) and a C-terminal primer based on a mouse EST (AI850886). Expression constructs of rat Rab5 (AF072935) with an N-terminal His tag in pET-11d and of the human endosomal autoantigen EEA1 (amino acids 1257–1411; L40157) fused to glutathioneS-transferase (GST)1 were the gift of M. Zerial (EMBL, Heidelberg). Constructs encoding rat Rab1B (X13905) and human Rab6A (M28212) with N-terminal His6-Myc tags in pQE9 were the gift of T. Weide (Department for Experimental Tumor Biology, University of Münster, Germany). Recombinant Rab proteins were expressed and purified under nondenaturing conditions following Qiagen protocols, with the addition of protease inhibitors (0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml pepstatin A, 2 µg/ml leupeptin) to the lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). Sequence regions of Rim1, rabphilin-3 (reference sequence, accession numberD29965), and aczonin (Y19185) were amplified from mouse brain RNA or from earlier subclones of these proteins and inserted into theSmaI site of the GST fusion vector pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mouse Rim1 partial cDNA sequence (codons 2–387) was newly determined after amplification with primers derived from the rat sequence (AF007836). GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α or BL21 cells and purified essentially according to Amersham Pharmacia Biotech protocols. To optimize the integrity of zinc finger domains, in a number of purifications, 50 µmZnCl2 was added to bacterial culture media, and the standard phosphate-buffered saline buffer (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4) was replaced by Tris-buffered saline plus DTT (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 µg/ml pepstatin A, 2 µg/ml leupeptin) for lysis and glutathione affinity column washing. Subsequent analysis showed that recombinant zinc finger proteins prepared in either way did not differ in zinc content or Rab3 binding behavior. GST fusion proteins were eluted with 15 mmglutathione in 50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline or Tris-buffered saline plus DTT, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford. All expression clones were authenticated by full-length sequencing of the inserts. The R33G mutation arose spontaneously during polymerase chain reaction/subcloning of the Rim-(9–387) sequence. The zinc assay was performed essentially as described (25Giedroc D.P. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Konigsberg W.H. Coleman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8452-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 700 µl of GST fusion proteins at 1 µm were mixed with 7 µl of 10 mm 4-(2-pyridylazo)-resorcinol, a Zn2+-binding dye, and titrated with successive 0.7-µl aliquots of 10 mm p-hydroxymercuriphenylsulfonate, a cysteine-modifying reagent, with 20-min incubations at room temperature between additions until a constant A 500was reached. Fusion protein buffer samples (phosphate-buffered saline or Tris-buffered saline plus DTT) were treated in the same way as blanks, and standard curves were prepared with ZnCl2 in the same buffer. As negative controls, samples of zinc fingerless constructs Rim-(2–55) and Rim-(18–55) were also analyzed, yielding only background values of <0.01 mol/mol. Zn2+ standard curves were also prepared in solutions of these control GST fusion proteins but did not differ in steepness from standard curves in buffer only. SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). One binding partner, referred to as the ligand, is immobilized on a sensor chip, and the interaction with a binding partner in free solution flowing over this surface, the analyte, is detected. Changes in surface concentration of the analyte are proportional to changes in the refractive index of the surface, resulting in changes of the SPR signal, plotted as response units (RUs). 1000 RUs corresponds to a surface concentration of 1 ng/mm2. Recombinant Rab proteins at concentrations of 20 µm were preincubated for 3.5 h at room temperature in buffer A (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 0.005% Tween 20) including 1 mm EDTA and either 0.5 mm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP. A control preincubation time course was performed, showing that saturation of Rab3A with GTPγS (i.e. maximal SPR signal intensity of Rab3A binding to Rim-(2–55)) was reached after 1 h. MgCl2 was then added to a total concentration of 3 mm, and incubation continued for 30 min. Dilution series of Rab proteins, typically in the concentration range from 20–40 nm to 5–10 µm were then prepared in buffer A with 3 mmMgCl2 and either 0.5 mm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP. The Rab6A dilution series was in the concentration range 78 nm to 10 µm. GST fusion proteins with Rim1, aczonin, and rabphilin-3 partial sequences were immobilized at surface densities of 500–800 RUs on an anti-GST antibody-coated surface, and the interaction with Rab proteins in rising concentration order was analyzed at 20 °C and at a flow rate of 30 µl/min in association and dissociation, again in buffer A with 3 mmMgCl2 and 0.5 mm GTPγS or 1 mmGDP. After each Rab protein concentration, the antibody surface was flushed with 10 mm glycine, pH 2.2, to remove the whole complex and was recharged with GST fusion proteins at the same surface density before a new Rab protein concentration was measured. Rab samples first passed through a sensor chip with a blank antibody surface, in series with the fusion protein-charged sensor chips, and the unspecific signal of the control chip was subtracted from the signals of the specific surfaces. Unless stated otherwise, binding data were evaluated by steady-state analysis, plotting the plateau of the SPR signal versus the analyte concentration, and fitted by nonlinear regression analysis with the Prism software package (GraphPad). In selected cases, association and dissociation rate constants were deduced from the initial signal courses of the association and dissociation phases, assuming Langmuir 1:1 binding and employing the BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore). Additional zinc finger-protecting measures in control experiments (inclusion of 10 µm ZnCl2 and 5 mm DTT in the preincubation and dilution buffers) did not enhance the Rab3A binding of Rim1 zinc finger constructs. Rat brains were homogenized in a glass-Teflon homogenizer in lysis buffer and centrifuged for 30 min at 120,000 × g and 4 °C. The standard lysis buffer was 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 µg/ml each of pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin. Alternatively, 25 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% sodium cholate, plus protease inhibitors as above, was used (“synaptosome extraction buffer”; Ref. 26Betz A. Okamoto M. Benseler F. Brose N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2520-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Supernatants were precleared by incubation with 110 volume of glutathione-agarose at 4 °C for 4 h and adjusted to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml with lysis buffer. Glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) were loaded with GST or with GST fusion proteins (20 µg of protein/20 µl of beads), preblocked with 3% BSA in lysis buffer for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer. 20-µl samples of loaded beads were incubated with 250-µl aliquots of cleared brain lysate supplemented with 2 mm GDP or with 0.5 mm GTPγS, at 4 °C overnight under end-over-end agitation. Beads were spun down, washed rapidly with 3 × 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer, and boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting employing the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were probed with the following antibodies: anti-Rab3 mAb clone 42.1 (recognizes Rab3A, -B, and -C; Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany), anti-panMunc13 clone 32, anti-γ-adaptin, and anti-Rab5 mAbs (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), anti-pan-Ras mAb clone AB3 (Calbiochem), anti-Rab6 rabbit serum C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Na/K-ATPase β1 subunit mAb (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-syntaxin mAb clone HPC-1 (undefined syntaxin isoform specificity but including syntaxin-1) and anti-pan-cadherin mAb clone CH-19 (both from Sigma), anti-synaptophysin rabbit serum (Biometra, Göttingen), and anti-synaptobrevin-2 mAb clone CL 69.1 (gift of R. Jahn, Max-Planck-Institute, Göttingen). Recombinant mouse Rim1 sequences encompassing various parts of the N-terminal 387 amino acids (Fig. 1) were fused to GST and expressed in bacteria, and their interaction with bacterially expressed, His6-tagged recombinant Rab3A was studied by SPR (Fig. 2, TableI). A binding site for GTPγS-saturated Rab3A was localized within a short sequence of high α-helix potential near the N terminus (amino acids 19–55; MQE … MLK), with aK d of 1.3 µm (mean of values determined with constructs Rim-(19–55) and Rim-(2–55)). GDP-saturated Rab3A at 20 µm concentration gave no binding signals.Figure 2Representative SPR tracings of short, middle-sized, and long Rim1 and rabphilin-3 constructs binding to Rab3A. In the association phase, Rab3A solution flows over the sensor surface preloaded with the Rim1 or rabphilin-3 constructs, followed in the dissociation phase by buffer only. The short Rim1 construct displays fast high affinity binding, onto which a minor slow, low affinity component is superimposed in the middle-sized and long constructs. The short rabphilin-3 construct exhibits fast, low affinity binding to which a slow, high affinity component adds itself in the long construct. For rabphilin-(40–178), two separately measured Rab3A concentration series in a high (156 nm to 10 µm) and in a low (2–78 nm; inset) concentration range are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IDissociation constants (Kd) for Rab protein binding to Rim1 sequences determined by SPRRim1 constructRab3A binding to Rim1K d ± S.D.No. of determinationsRim-(19–55)1.49 ± 0.23 µmn = 5*Rim-(19–55, R33G)Weak binding at 5–10 µmn = 5Rim-(2–55)1.08 ± 0.53 µmn = 10Rim-(2–42)No binding up to 10 µmn = 3Rim-(56–228)No binding up to 10 µmn = 2Rim-(2–228)2.05 ± 1.44 µmn = 3Rim-(2–228, Δ83–105)2.67 ± 0.99 µmn = 3Rim-(2–228, Δ56–82)2.06 ± 1.44 µmn = 4Rim-(2–228, Δ56–105)1.70 ± 0.85 µmn = 2*Rim-(9–387, R33G)No binding up to 10 µmn = 3Rim-(9–387, Δ83–105)2.65 µmn = 1Rim-(9–387, Δ56–82)2.12 ± 1.38 µmn = 5Rim-(9–387, Δ56–105)1.7 µmn = 1K d valuesRab3C binding to Rim1Rab3D binding to Rim1Rab6A binding to Rim1µmµmRim-(2–55)2.11.0Binds at 5 µmRim-(2–228, Δ56–82)2.71.1Binds at 5 µmRim-(9–387, Δ56–82)2.92.616 µmK d values are means from up to n = 10 independent measurements with Rab3 concentration series as shown in Fig. 2 ± S.D.

K d values of Rab3C, Rab3D, and Rab6A were determined from n = 1 concentration series each. Mutant Rim1 constructs are marked by an asterisk. Sequences immediately adjacent to this Rab3 binding site of Rim1 are subject to differential splicing (deletion of amino acids 56–82 (CVV … PPL), 83–105 (NIF … RNW), or 56–105). In RNA from 5-month-old mouse brain, we found all four possible variants to occur in similar abundances, judged from the relative band intensities of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products in gel electrophoresis and from the recovery of cDNA subclones. Rab3 binding, however, was not significantly affected by differential splicing in this region (Fig. 1, Table I). Sequences further downstream, extending to amino acid 228 ( … EVP) or 387 ( … RYP), did not bind Rab3A on their own; nor did they affect significantly the Rab3A affinity of the Rim1 N-terminal α-helix (Fig.1, Table I). These downstream sequences include the zinc fingers and the SGAWFF motif, whose counterparts are important for Rab3A binding to rabphilin-3 (12Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Ostermeier C. Brünger A.T.

In contrast, a point mutation (R33G) in the α-helical motif virtually abolished Rab3A binding of long and short Rim1 constructs (Fig. 1, Table I). The N-terminal α-helix motif of Rim1 was found to contain sufficient information not only for the affinity but also for the Rab protein specificity of binding. The Rab3 isoforms, Rab3C and Rab3D, bound with affinities indiscriminable from Rab3A and similarly to long, intermediate, and short Rim1 constructs (Table I). Rab6A bound at 2.5 or 5 µm to Rim1 constructs representing all sizes and different splice variants (Rim-(2–55), Rim-(2–228, Δ56–82), Rim-(9–387, Δ56–82), Rim-(9–387, Δ83–105), and Rim-(9–387, Δ56–105)). A K d of 16 µm was determined for Rab6A binding to Rim-(9–387, Δ56–82) (Table I). Like Rab3, Rab6A bound only if saturated with GTPγS, not with GDP. In contrast, GTPγS complexes of several other Rab proteins at concentrations of 5 µm (Rab1B, Rab5, Rab7, Rab8, and Rab11A) did not bind to Rim-(2–55) or to Rim-(2–228, Δ56–82) (not shown). Rabphilin-3 also contains an α-helical motif in its N-terminal region, which has distant sequence similarity to the Rab3 binding site of Rim1 (Fig. 3). In the crystal structure (23Ostermeier C. Brünger A.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), this α-helix constitutes the main interface of rabphilin-3 with Rab3A, contacting switch I and switch II of the GTPase. However, pull-down and crystallization experiments have shown that additional downstream sequences including the zinc finger and SGAWFF motifs are important for Rab3A binding to rabphilin-3 (12Stahl B. Chou J.H. Li C. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Ostermeier C. Brünger A.T.

To compare the contributions of these different determinants to the Rab3 binding behaviors of Rim1 versus rabphilin-3 in our experimental system, we also analyzed two selected rabphilin-3 constructs by SPR, rabphilin-(40–88) and rabphilin-(40–178) (Fig. 2). The first construct, containing the N-terminal α-helix of rabphilin-3 but not the zinc finger motif indeed also bound Rab3A-GTPγS but not Rab3A-GDP, with rapid association and dissociation kinetics and low affinity. K d values of 16 and 97 µmwere estimated in two independent measurements like that shown in Fig.2, with concentration series up to 10 µm. The longer construct, rabphilin-(40–178), was endowed by the additional downstream sequences with a complex binding behavior that seemed to be composed of a slow, high affinity and a fast, low affinity component (Fig. 2). Kinetic fits at low Rab3A concentrations (2–78 nm and 156–625 nm in four measurements with two different rabphilin-(40–178) protein preparations) resulted inK d values for the high affinity component of 10–20 nm (i.e. 2 orders of magnitude lower than th"

Plant Physiol. 1984; 35: 155-189Crossref Google Scholar), the precursor methionine is first converted toS-adenosylmethionine (SAM)1 by methionine adenosyltransferase, followed by the conversion of SAM to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) by ACC synthase (EC 4.4.1.14). Finally, ACC is oxidized to ethylene by ACC oxidase. For the above pathway, conversion of SAM to ACC is the rate-determining step. Thus, ACC synthase is the key enzyme in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in higher plants. ACC synthase (ACS) requires pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP or vitamin B6) as the cofactor for its catalysis and thus is a member of PLP-dependent enzymes. The PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze a wide variety of reactions in the metabolism of amino acids including transamination, racemization, deamination, decarboxylation, and elimination or replacement of β and γ carbons.

Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), three-dimensional structures of PLP-dependent enzymes have been determined at an explosive speed in the last decade, and over 200 crystal structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank to date. The structures of PLP enzymes are classified into four types of fold (10Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Extensive biochemical and structural studies reveal that PLP-dependent enzymes reserve a common mechanism of catalysis (10Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, it remains unknown what is the determinant to define specificities of PLP enzymes. The crystal structures of tomato ACS containing PLP and competitive inhibitor aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), as reported in this paper, suggest that Tyr152 plays a key role on the γ elimination, thus providing insight into the individual pathway of ACS catalysis. The truncated ripening-induced tomato ACS with amino acids 11–439 (485 amino acids for the full-length ACS) was inserted into the expression vector pET11d and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (11Li N. Huxtable S. Yang S.F. Kung S.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ACS was purified using a slightly modified protocol of Li and Mattoo (12Li N. Mattoo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after cell lysis by French press, ACS was separated by ammonium sulfate fractionation and column chromatography of DEAE ionic exchange, hydroxylapatite, and Sephadex G75. A typical yield from 2 liters of cell culture was 20–30 mg of active ACS with a purity of >95% as judged from the SDS gel. Crystals of tomato ACS complexed with cofactor PLP were grown by the vapor diffusion methods. The protein drop contained the ACS-PLP mixture in a ratio of 1:1.1. The well buffer was 20 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.0, 0.2m Li2SO4, and 19–23% polyethylene glycol 3350. Yellow diamond-shaped crystals reached a typical size of 0.3 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm3 in 1 week, but the color faded quickly, presumably as a result of PLP hydrolysis. The crystals have the space group P6422 with cell dimensions of a = b = 123.2 and c = 212.8 Å and contain two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. The ACS·PLP·AVG complex was prepared by mixing ACS, PLP, and AVG in a molecular ratio of 1:2:2 and crystallized by vapor diffusion against a well buffer of 0.1 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 18% polyethylene glycol 3350, 50 mm MgCl2, and 10% ethylene glycol. The crystals have the space group P6222 with cell dimensions of a = b = 123.1, c = 106.8 Å, and one molecule per crystallographic asymmetric unit. The diffraction data for the ACS·PLP and ACS·PLP·AVG crystals were collected, respectively, on a Rigaku RAXIS IV phosphate imaging plate system and on beamline X12C of Brookhaven National Synchrotron Light Source at 100 K (Table I). The cryosolvents were prepared by the addition of 10–20% ethylene glycol into the crystallization buffers. The data were processed with the program HKL (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The ACS·PLP·AVG structure was determined by the molecular replacement program AMoRe (14Navaza J. Saludjian P. Method Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) using a monomer of apple ACS as the initial model (15Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The rotation and translation search revealed clearly a solution with a correlation coefficient of 0.452 and an R factor of 0.439 for 3672 reflections between 4 and 8 Å resolution. The binary ACS·PLP structure was determined by using the refined ACS·PLP·AVG structure as the initial model. Our program SUDOTR (16Chook Y.M. Lipscomb W.N. Ke H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 822-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) detected a pseudo translation approximately half-c unit cell for the two molecules in the crystallographic asymmetric unit of the ACS·PLP crystal. Thus, two solutions with the same orientation but half-c difference yielded a correlation coefficient of 0.353 and an R factor of 0.489 for 7329 reflections between 4 and 8 Å resolution. The model was rebuilt by the program O (17Jones T.A. Sayer D. Computational Crystallography. Oxford University Press, London1982: 303-317Google Scholar) and refined by CNS (18Brünger A.T. et al.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16961) Google Scholar). The final refinement yielded R factor/Rfree of 0.214/0.289 for ACS·PLP·AVG at 2.7 Å resolution and of 0.218/0.293 for ACS·PLP at 2.8 Å resolution (TableI). The structural comparison was performed with the programs Dali (19Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar) and CCP4 (20Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19757) Google Scholar). The program Dali is an automatic Monte Carlo procedure to optimize pairwise alignment of the whole sequences in protein structures. The program LSQKAB in the CCP4 suite performs a least-squared fit of the fragments with common folding in comparison. The electron density map showed that the most portions of the structures were well ordered in both ternary ACS·PLP·AVG and binary ACS·PLP complexes. The loops containing residues 20–24, 78–81, and 439 were omitted in the structures for lack of electron density. Residues 1–10 and 440–485 were not included in the construct for the protein expression. The (2Fo − Fc) map for ACS·PLP·AVG, which was calculated from the model omitting PLP·AVG during structural refinement, clearly revealed the binding of both PLP and AVG (Fig. 1). The electron density for PLP was continuous from the side chain of Lys278, indicating a covalent bond between C4′ of the pyridine and amine of Lys278. In the binary ACS·PLP complex, however, the electron density for PLP was poor, and the most recognizable pieces of density were two strong peaks associated with Arg286 and Arg412, respectively. The monomer of tomato ACS contains two domains and is similar to the structure of apple ACS (15Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The αβα sandwich domain comprises a central seven-strand β-sheet flanking with nine α-helices (residues 82–322 or H3–H11, Fig.2), whereas the αβ domain consists of five β strands and five α-helices (residues 11–19, 25–77, and 323–438). In the dimeric form, N-terminal residues 11–19 contact with the C-terminal helix H14 (Fig. 2B). The significance of the interactions is not clear but may be important for conformation stabilization and catalysis as suggested by the biochemical study (11Li N. Huxtable S. Yang S.F. Kung S.D. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,12Li N. Mattoo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystallographic asymmetric units contain a dimer in the ACS·PLP crystal and a monomer in the ACS·PLP·AVG crystal (Fig.2). The structural superposition revealed RMS deviations of 0.58 Å for the backbone atoms between ACS·PLP·AVG and ACS·PLP and of 0.41 between two monomers of the ACS·PLP dimer, indicating that the inhibitor binding does not induce substantial changes of the enzyme conformation. It has been a general observation that the dimeric form is a basic catalytic unit of most PLP-dependent enzymes (10Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Many PLP-dependent enzymes have cofactor PLP and substrate binding to the active site of one molecule and also interacting with the residues from the second molecule. This physical sharing of an active site by two monomers within a dimer is direct evidence for the active dimeric unit. In addition, cytosolic AAT undergoes a conformational change upon the substrate binding (21Jäger J. Moser M. Sauder U. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 285-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 22Rhee S. Silva M.M. Hyde C.C. Rogers P.H. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17293-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase shows asymmetric catalysis, in which PLP forms a covalent bond with Lys273 in only one molecule of the dimer (23Hennig M. Grimm B. Contestabile R. John R.A. Jansonius J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4866-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This mutual dependence and allosteric communication between two subunits within a dimer further support the argument that a dimer of PLP enzymes is a catalytic unit. ACS is physically a dimer in the crystal structures of both tomato and apple (15Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), indicating a functional dimeric form. However, characteristics of the ACS structures lead us to suggest that monomeric ACS may also be catalytically active. The structural comparison showed no substantial conformational changes upon the binding of inhibitor AVG. This lack of communication between two monomers of ACS is in contrast to the allosteric activation of other PLP enzymes and likely indicates the independence of two active sites in the ACS dimer. Indeed, the residues interacting with PLP and AVG and the catalytic residues identified by the sequence alignment are located entirely within an active site of a monomer, implying that a monomer of ACS may be sufficient to accomplish the catalysis. This assumption is consistent with the biochemical results that both the monomer (12Li N. Mattoo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Bleecker A.B.

Our structure supports the argument that the proteolytic cleavage of ACS into hyperactive monomeric ACS may occur in vivo upon the endogenous and exogenous stimuli such as ripening and wounding induction (12Li N. Mattoo A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6908-6917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we note that the side chains of Gln90 and Tyr92 from the second subunit sit ∼4 Å away from the closest atoms of AVG. Further structural study is needed to clarify whether Gln90 and Tyr92contribute to SAM binding and the catalysis. Among 32 structures of PLP-dependent enzymes in the Protein Data Bank, 29 use the pyridoxal moiety of PLP for their catalysis and have been classified into four structural fold types (10Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Fold type I contains a large αβα sandwich domain and a small αβ domain, and PLP mainly binds to the αβα domain, as shown in an example of tomato ACS (Fig. 2). Fold types II and IV have two αβ domains with approximately equal size, and PLP binds between two domains. Fold type III consists of a large triose-phosphate isomerase barrel domain on which PLP binds and a small αβ domain. On first glance, the four families of PLP enzymes share a limited conservation of the PLP binding residues but no common structure fold. Thus, it has been a mystery how PLP binds to active sites with different geometric shapes and what the evolutionary relationship between different families of PLP enzymes is. It has been argued that different structural folding but significant conservation of the PLP binding residues represents convergent evolution (30Sugio S. Petsko G.A. Manning J.M. Soda K. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9661-9669Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A comparison of tomato ACS with structures in the Protein Data Bank using the program Dali (19Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar) results in a list of 51 structures that have a Z score better than 2 and are considered to share significant structural homology. Among these structures, 19 are PLP-dependent enzymes, and 18 belong to fold type I. The best superimposition occurred between tomato and apple ACSs (15Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) that share sequence identity of 57% and show a Z score of 60.8 and an RMS deviation of 0.817 Å for 403 C-α atoms. A graphic display of the superimposed tomato and apple ACS structures revealed very similar conformations of PLP and the active site residues. Fold type I of PLP enzymes has been divided further into subgroups Ia and Ib (31Okamoto A. Kato R. Masui R. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Kuramitsu S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 119: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Enzymes in subgroup Ia but not Ib show large conformational changes upon the binding of substrate or inhibitors (10Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 22Rhee S. Silva M.M. Hyde C.C. Rogers P.H. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Arnone A. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Tomato ACS superimposes on subgroup Ib better than Ia. For example, the superposition of tomato ACS on Thermus thermophilus AAT (33Nakai T. Okada K. Akutsu S. Miyahara I. Kawaguchi S. Kato R. Kuramtsu S. Hirotsu K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2413-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) of subgroup Ib showed a Z score of 37.9 and an RMS deviation of 2.4 Å for 350 of 380 total residues, whereas the superposition on pig AAT in subgroup Ia (22Rhee S. Silva M.M. Hyde C.C. Rogers P.H. Metzler C.M. Metzler D.E. Arnone A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17293-17302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) has a Z score of 15.4 and an RMS deviation of 3.5 Å for 274 of 413 total residues. Thus, tomato ACS apparently belongs to subgroup Ib, in consideration of the good superposition and the absence of conformational change upon inhibitor binding. On the other hand, the program Dali surprisingly detected a common fold between ACS in fold type I and mouse ornithine decarboxylase (34Kern A.D. Oliveira M.A. Coffino P. Hackert M.L. Structure. 1999; 7: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) in fold type III, showing a Z score of 2.2 for 135 amino acids in comparison. Superposition of the common fragment of ACS on that of mouse ornithine decarboxylase with the CCP4 program LSQKAB yielded an RMS deviation of 2.2 Å for the backbone atoms of 63 residues (TableII, Fig. 3A). This structural homology encouraged us to reexamine the structural homology of fold type I to other fold types of PLP enzymes. Indeed, a manual superposition identified a common folding motif between ACS in fold type I and tryptophan synthase β subunit (TSB, Refs. 35Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Moles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and 36Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4211-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) in fold type II. Superposition of the common motif of ACS on that of the TSB subunit by the program LSQKAB resulted in an RMS deviation of 2.2 Å for the backbone atoms of 58 residues in comparison (TableII and Fig. 3B). Because the common motifs identified above also exist in the structures of other members of fold types I, II, and III, the homology suggests that the PLP-dependent enzymes evolved divergently from a common origin. Based on the fact that the common structural motif in ACS and mouse ornithine decarboxylase contains significant numbers of residues for PLP and substrate binding, we argue that this motif could serve as a core fold for the PLP-dependent enzymes. However, we note that the fragment of TSB barely comprises PLP binding residues. The explanation is unclear, but loss of the conservation could be the consequence of divergent evolution.Table IISuperposition between fold types I, II, and III of PLP-dependent enzymesProteinResiduesProteinResiduesACS (Fold type I)142–147mODC149–154181–207(Fold type III)173–199217–227(PDB code 7odc)209–219233–238231–236240–242237–239256–257258–259268–273268–273276–277279–280RMS deviation = 2.2 Å for backbone atoms of 63 residuesACS181–186TSB91–96188–192(Fold type II)97–101198–207(PDB code 1ttq)102–111220–239116–135254–256146–148270–278154–162144–148183–187RMS deviation = 2.2 Å for backbone atoms of 58 residues Open table in a new tab Despite the fact that PLP-dependent enzymes catalyze a wide variety of reactions with different specificities, their catalytic mechanisms have been considered to possess two common steps: an internal aldimine covalent intermediate with lysine and an external aldimine with substrate, followed by individual pathways dependent on the specificity of catalysis (10Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). PLP contains five binding components: C4′, N1, and O3 of pyridine, the stacking of pyridine ring, and the phosphoryl group. The lysine residue forming the internal aldimine with C4′ is absolutely conserved among all members of PLP-dependent enzymes. The structure-based sequence alignment shows good conservation on the residues for the formation of hydrogen bonds with N1 and O3 of pyridine and for hydrophobic stacking against the pyridine ring, suggesting an overall conservation of the catalytic mechanism of PLP-dependent enzymes. On the other hand, the residues for the binding of the PLP phosphate moiety (Ala127, Thr128, Ser275, Ser277, and Arg286 in ACS) are poorly conserved, even for members of the AAT family that have very similar three-dimensional structures. Apparently, the PLP phosphate plays a role in the binding and orientation of the cofactor in the active site, as seen from its hydrogen-bonding network with protein residues in all the PLP enzymes. However, it is not clear whether the PLP phosphate contributes to the protonation/deprotonation status of the pyridine ring. If the phosphate is not involved directly in proton manipulation, we speculate that an artificial cofactor composed of a pyridine ring and a phosphate surrogate such as a carboxylate group might serve as a cofactor for the catalysis. In addition to the covalent bond with Lys278, PLP interacts with Ala127, Thr128, Tyr152, Asn209, Asp237, Tyr240, Ser275, Ser277, Lys278, and Arg286 of ACS (Fig. 4). The potential roles of these residues are discussed below. Asp237 of tomato ACS forms a hydrogen bond with N1 of PLP (Fig. 4). This aspartate is well conserved among PLP-dependent enzymes except for serine in fold type II, glutamic acid in mouse ornithine decarboxylase of fold type III and members of fold type IV, and arginine in alanine racemase of fold type III. The function of this aspartate may stabilize the protonation status of the pyridine. For most members of the PLP-dependent enzymes, the pyridine nitrogen is probably protonated, and a general base such as a negatively charged residue or serine stabilizes the protonation state of the pyridine ring. An exception is Arg219 in alanine racemase, which forms a hydrogen bond with the pyridine nitrogen. It has been assumed that the pyridine nitrogen in alanine racemase is unprotonated (37Stamper C.G. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10438-10445Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence variation at this position probably implies a versatility of the detailed catalytic mechanisms of PLP-dependent enzymes. Pyridine O3 of PLP forms two hydrogen bonds with Tyr240 and Asn209 (Fig. 4). Important roles for these residues have been implicated by mutagenesis, in which the Y233F mutant of apple ACS shows a 24-fold increase in Km (27White M.F. Vasquez J. Yang S.F. Kirsch J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12428-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The spatial proximity of the tyrosine to the substrate might imply its direct involvement in the protonation/deprotonation of substrate. For example, the corresponding residues Ser177 in phosphoserine aminotransferase (38Hester G. Stark W. Moser M. Kallen J. Markovic-Housley Z. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 829-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and His162 in 3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid synthase (39Eads J.C. Beeby M. Scapin G. Yu T.W. Floss H.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9840-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have been proposed to lower the pKa of pyridine for the exchange of internal-external aldimines. Also, Tyr265 in alanine racemase has been proposed to act as a general base for nucleophilic attack on the α carbon of the substrate (37Stamper C.G. Morollo A.A. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10438-10445Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The apparent role of Tyr152 in catalysis is to stabilize the orientation of the pyridine ring of PLP in the active site by stacking. On the basis of this argument, it might be expected that any residues with an aromatic ring orient the pyridine ring of PLP appropriately. Indeed, the tyrosine can be replaced with tryptophan, phenylalanine, or histidine in many PLP-dependent enzymes. Another proposed role for the tyrosine is to increase the electron sink character of PLP via the π-electron interaction between the parallel rings (40Clausen T. Huber R. Prade L. Wahl M.C. Messerschmidt A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6827-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, this proposal is weakened by the perpendicular orientation of the rings in 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (41Storici P. Capitani G. De Biase D. Moser M. John R.A. Jansonius J.N. Schirmer T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8628-8634Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (23Hennig M. Grimm B. Contestabile R. John R.A. Jansonius J.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4866-4871Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate aminotransferase (PDB entry 1dty), and 2,2-dialkylglycine decarboxylase (42Toney M.D. Hohenester E. Keller J.W. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 151-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Last, an important role of the tyrosine or its correspondent may be its direct involvement in catalysis.

The neighboring of Tyr152 to AVG in the ACS·PLP·AVG structure implies a dual role for Tyr152: direct participation in catalysis (see below) and stacking stabilization of the pyridine ring orientation. Indeed, substitution of the tyrosine by asparagine in ACS resulted in a loss of 95–100% of enzymatic activity (47Tarun A.S. Lee J.S. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9796-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The competitive inhibitor AVG binds at a location neighboring PLP (Fig. 4). The α-amino group of AVG sits ∼4 Å away from C4′ of pyridine, a promising position for the formation of a covalent external aldimine with PLP. The α-carboxylate group of AVG forms three hydrogen bonds, respectively, with the backbone nitrogen of Ala54, the guanidine nitrogen of Arg412, and water. Arg412 is well conserved in PLP-dependent enzymes and has been proposed to bind the α-carboxylate group of substrate in ornithine aminotransferase (48Storici P. Capitani G. Muller R. Schirmer T. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), cystine C-S lyase (45Clausen T. Kaiser J.T. Steegborn C. Huber R. Kessler D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1999; 291: 857-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The critical role of Arg412 for substrate binding is supported by the observation that the R407K mutation of apple ACS increased the Km value of SAM at least 20-fold and reduced kcat/Kmby 4 orders (27White M.F. Vasquez J. Yang S.F. Kirsch J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12428-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The amine group at the other end of AVG forms van der Waals contact with Tyr152. Overall, the orientation and interaction of AVG in ACS is similar to the binding of AVG in the structures of cystathionine β-lyase (43Clausen T. Huber R. Messerschmidt A. Pohlenz H.D. Laber B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12633-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and cystalysin (32Krupka H.I. Huber R. Holt S.C. Clausen T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3168-3178Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) but does not form a covalent ketimine complex. Thus, the α-amino and α-carboxylate groups of AVG may simulate SAM binding in ACS. In general, the catalytic mechanism of a PLP enzyme comprises four essential stages: an internal aldimine intermediate with enzyme lysine, an external aldimine intermediate with substrate, substrate conversion (elimination, etc.), and transaldimination to release the product (7Hayashi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 463-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 10Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Although the two aldimine intermediates have been well characterized for many enzymes, the details of substrate conversion remain to be illustrated. The protonation on the α carbon of substrate may be stabilized efficiently by the quinonoid intermediate of pyridine in most PLP enzymes, but the pyridine conjugation is unlikely to impact significantly on the γ elimination that occurs three bonds away from the amino group. Thus, a protein residue in ACS seems necessary for the C-γ–S bond cleavage of SAM, representing a special mechanism accomplished corporately by both PLP and a protein residue. Substrate SAM was modeled into the active site of ACS by simulating AVG binding. The α-carboxylate group of SAM forms hydrogen bonds with Arg412 and the backbone nitrogen of Ala54, whereas the α-amino group points to C4′ for the formation of the external aldimine (Fig. 5). The O2′ and O3′ atoms of the sugar of SAM form hydrogen bonds with the guanidine group of Arg157. The adenine ring of SAM is located in a hydrophobic pocket contributed by Pro26, Tyr27, Phe28, and Pro153. An important finding in the modeling is that the OH group of Tyr152 is positioned ∼3.7 and 3.5 Å from C-γ and S of SAM. This distance may be close enough for Tyr152 to perform a nucleophilic attack on C-γ of SAM for the elimination. Our model is supported by the Y152N and R157G mutations that resulted in a loss of >95% enzyme activity (47Tarun A.S. Lee J.S. Theologis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9796-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A putative catalytic mechanism is proposed on the basis of the above model (Fig. 6). Arg412 brings substrate SAM to the position neighboring the PLP-lysine internal aldimine, and Tyr240 attracts the proton of Lys278 to promote the formation of the external aldimine. Next, Tyr152 performs a nucleophilic attack on C-γ of SAM to break the C-γ–S bond, while Arg157 and Arg412 are holding SAM for the cleavage. A covalent intermediate may form between Tyr152 and C-γ via a mechanism similar to transmethylation reactions (50Walsh C. Walsh C. Enzymatic Reaction Mechanisms. Freeman & Company, 1979Google Scholar) and is then converted to ACC·aldimine, a key intermediate proposed by several groups (15Capitani G. Hohenester E. Feng L. Storici P. Kirsch J.F. Jansonius J.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 745-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 51Ramalingam K. Lee K.M. Woodard R.W. Bleecker A.B. Kende H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Last, unprotonated Lys278 attacks the C4′ of PLP to release ACC (Fig. 6). Overall, our mechanism is consistent with the general scheme of the PLP-dependent catalysis (10Jansonius J.N. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, a potential nucleophilic attack by Tyr152 on the C-γ of SAM for the γ elimination is apparently unique among PLP enzymes. The concerted catalysis by PLP and a protein residue such as Tyr152 in ACS may represent a general scheme for the diversity of PLP-dependent catalyses.

The largest group of peroxisomal diseases consists of aberrations in β-oxidation caused by a single defective enzyme (1Moser H.W. Clin. Biochem. 1991; 24: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Defects resulting in a drop in the carbon flux through β-oxidation additionally impede the scheduled expansion of the peroxisomal compartment both in human cells (3Chang C.-C. South S. Warren D.

This study is concerned with the molecular basis for the defects in β-oxidation and peroxisome proliferation in yeast cells devoid of Adr1p (5Simon M. Adam G. Rapatz W. Spevak W. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, peroxisomes represent the exclusive site for fatty acid β-oxidation (6Kunau W.-H. Dommes V. Schulz H. Prog. Lipid Res. 1995; 34: 267-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Supplying S. cerevisiaecells with oleic acid as a sole carbon source causes them to induce the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation by about 10-fold (7Veenhuis M. Mateblowski M. Kunau W.-H. Harder W. Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H.

Yeast. 1987; 3: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This dual response to oleic acid is mediated by the Pip2p-Oaf1p transcription factor, which binds to a promoter element termed ORE1 in target genes (8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Luo Y. Karpichev I.V. Kohanski R.A. Small G.M. J. Biol.

Cells devoid of this transcription factor fail to degrade oleic acid or expand their peroxisomal compartment (8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H.

The dual response to oleic acid is also severely impaired inadr1Δ mutant cells, which similarly are unable to break down oleic acid or proliferate their peroxisomes (5Simon M. Adam G. Rapatz W. Spevak W. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 10Simon M.M. Pavlik P. Hartig A. Binder M. Ruis H. Cook W.J. Denis C.L. Schanz B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The Adr1p transcription factor has been identified previously as a regulator of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene ADH2 (11Ciriacy M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 138: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Adr1p binds to the consensus sequence C(T/C)CC(A/G)(A/T/G)N4–36 (T/A/C)(T/C)GG(A/G)G, termed UAS1 (12Cheng C. Kacherovsky N. Dombek K.M. Camier S. Thukral S.K. Rhim E. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3842-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Adr1p is also known to regulate the transcription of the gene for peroxisomal catalase A by binding directly to UAS1CTA1 (5Simon M. Adam G. Rapatz W. Spevak W. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar); however, the influence of Adr1p on the transcription of genes encoding peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes such as Fox2p and Pot1p/Fox3p was reported to be less pronounced and possibly indirect (13Simon M. Binder M. Adam G. Hartig A. Ruis H. Yeast. 1992; 8: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 14Igual J.C. Navarro B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 446-455PubMed Google Scholar). Interest in the role of Adr1p in peroxisome function was regained recently by the finding that Adr1p tightly regulates SPS19 encoding peroxisomal 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase by binding to UAS1SPS19 (15Gurvitz A. Rottensteiner H. Kilpeläinen S.H. Hartig A. Hiltunen J.K. Binder M. Dawes I.W. Hamilton B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22140-22147Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, because neitherCTA1 nor SPS19 are essential for growth on oleic acid, the precise role of Adr1p in regulating either the carbon flux through the β-oxidation spiral or peroxisome proliferation is still not understood fully. With respect to the β-oxidation phenotype ofadr1Δ mutant cells, a canonical UAS1 (CTCCGAN36TTGGGG) occurs at position −247 upstream of the ATG start site of POX1 (12Cheng C. Kacherovsky N. Dombek K.M. Camier S. Thukral S.K. Rhim E. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3842-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the product of which, acyl-CoA oxidase, represents the first and rate-limiting step of theβ-oxidation spiral (17Dmochowska A. Dignard D. Maleszka R. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 88: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hence, if POX1 were to turn out to be regulated by Adr1p, it could explain why theadr1Δ mutant strain fails to degrade oleic acid. As for the reduced size and number of peroxisomes in the adr1Δ mutant (10Simon M.M. Pavlik P. Hartig A. Binder M. Ruis H. Cook W.J. Denis C.L. Schanz B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), a possible clue for this might lie in the similarity to the situation in pip2Δ and oaf1Δ strains (8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar,9Luo Y. Karpichev I.V. Kohanski R.A. Small G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12068-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These latter two mutants have smaller and fewer peroxisomes because they fail to transcribe properly the Pip2p-Oaf1p dependent genePEX11 (8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Pex11p is vital for proper proliferation of an otherwise readily discernible peroxisomal compartment (18Erdmann R. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 19Marshall P.A. Krimkevich Y.I. Lark R.H. Dyer J.M. Veenhuis M. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and is also critical for Faa2p-dependent activation of medium-chain fatty acids prior to β-oxidation (4Van Roermund C.W. Tabak H.F. Van Den Berg M. Wanders R.J. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). According to the yeast data bases, the PEX11 promoter contains UAS1-like sequences; therefore, should the gene be demonstrated to depend on Adr1p for its transcription, this could shed additional light on the reason for the peroxisome-proliferation phenotype of the adr1Δ mutant. In the present study, the role of Adr1p was examined with respect to the regulation of POX1 and PEX11. We also studied the significance of the close proximity between OREs and UAS1s that appears in these as well as in several other genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation. The results are discussed in terms of processes contributing to peroxisome proliferation.

The rate oftrans-2-decenoyl-CoA generation was monitored spectrophotometrically using 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase andl-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase as described previously for the Δ3-Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase assay (29Palosaari P.M.

The following procedures were performed according to published methods: nucleic acid manipulations, formaldehyde gel electrophoresis, blotting and hybridization (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), yeast RNA preparation for Northern analysis (31Richter K.

The use ofPOX1, PEX11, POT1/FOX3,CTA1, and ACT1 as probes in the Northern blot has been reported previously (8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protein-DNA binding experiments were performed according to a published protocol (8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fragments containing UAS1CTA1 or POT1/FOX3 ORE were isolated from the plasmids pLW81 (16Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and pSKFOX3ORE (34Gurvitz A. Hamilton B. Hartig A. Ruis H. Dawes I.W. Rottensteiner H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), respectively. DNA fragment isolations were performed using QIAEX II (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The promoters of both POX1 and PEX11 contain potential UAS1s. However, unlike the canonical UAS1 in the POX1 promoter (12Cheng C. Kacherovsky N. Dombek K.M. Camier S. Thukral S.K. Rhim E. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3842-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the promoter of PEX11 contains two UAS1-like variants. One occurs at position −119 (TTCCATN30TCGGAG, nucleotides in bold diverge from the palindrome consensus) with the 3′ half-site situated within the PEX11 ORE. A second potential element in the PEX11 promoter, occurring as a tandem array of two half-sites (CTCCAAN18 CTCCAT), can be found relatively close to the ATG start site at position −42. To determine whether Adr1p is important for transcribingPOX1 or PEX11, a Northern blot was used to study transcription in cells grown under various carbon source conditions. RNA was extracted from wild-type and adr1Δ mutant cells as well as from control cells lacking either Pip2p, the specific activator of ORE-regulated genes (8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), or both Pip2p and Adr1p. The results showed that the adr1Δ deletion caused a complete loss of induction of both POX1 and PEX11 in cells grown on oleic acid (Fig. 1A). This defect was similar to that caused by the pip2Δ deletion. The Northern blot results were validated using probes representing the genes POT1/FOX3 and CTA1, which are subordinate to varying extents to both Pip2p-Oaf1p and Adr1p (8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J.

Biochem. 1993; 214: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ACT1 represented a control gene, the regulation of which is independent of either transcription factor (Fig.1 A). The data indicated that Adr1p was probably important for POX1 and PEX11 transcription. To substantiate the apparent requirement for Adr1p to express Pox1p and Pex11p, immunoblotting was performed on soluble protein extracts from wild-type, adr1Δ, or pip2Δoaf1Δ cells. The results demonstrated that under oleic acid-medium conditions, Adr1p was essential for obtaining induced levels of Pox1p and Pex11p, i.e. for increasing the amount of protein beyond the levels already seen on the ethanol medium (Fig. 1 B). This resembled the situation with cells lacking Pip2p-Oaf1p (Fig. 1 B). In comparison, Cta1p and particularly Pot1p/Fox3p were less stringently regulated by Adr1p. Pgk1p served as an internal control for equal loading of protein (Fig. 1 B). The dependence of Pox1p expression on Adr1p was underscored by assaying for acyl-CoA oxidase activity in soluble protein extracts from oleic acid-grown cells. The results showed that although oxidase activity measured in the wild-type extracts reached 0.17 ± 0.04 (mean ± S.D., n = 3) nmol × min−1/mg of protein, oxidase activity in extracts obtained from adr1Δ,pip2Δoaf1Δ, or pox1Δ mutant cells was below the detection limit of 0.02 nmol × min−1/mg of protein. Hence, the induced expression of Pox1p and Pex11p under oleic acid medium conditions strictly depended on Adr1p (in addition to Pip2p-Oaf1p), arguing in favor of a blockage in both β-oxidation and peroxisome proliferation inadr1Δ mutant cells. We then tested whether the canonical UAS1POX1 might represent a binding target for Adr1p. As for PEX11, it resembled GUT1(36Grauslund M. Lopes J.M. Rønnow B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in that its promoter contains a potential Adr1p element with two half-sites arranged as a direct repeat. In addition, thePEX11 promoter also has a potential UAS1/ORE overlap similar to that in SPS19 (16Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2,A and B). Although the issue of whether Adr1p directly regulates PEX11 remains open, the binding properties of these two classes of element arrangements,i.e. linear or ORE overlapping, have been investigated previously. On the other hand, the POX1 promoter contains a novel arrangement that consists of a potential UAS1POX1, within which is nested the entire POX1 ORE (Fig.2 C). To study the protein-binding properties of the two superimposed elements in POX1, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed using competitor DNA fragments generated from annealed oligonucleotide pairs. The results demonstrated that the addition of soluble protein extracts from wild-type cells grown on oleic acid to labeled POT1/FOX3 ORE gave rise to a Pip2p-Oaf1p complex (8Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Filipits M. Binder M. Hamilton B. Tabak H.F. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Luo Y. Karpichev I.V. Kohanski R.A. Small G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12068-12075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that was missing from the extract derived from similarly grownpip2Δoaf1Δ cells (Fig. 2 D,lanes 2 and 3). The addition of excessPOT1/FOX3 ORE (self-competitor DNA) caused this signal to disappear (lane 4). Similarly, excessive amounts of eitherPOX1 ORE or UAS1POX1 were also able to compete for the Pip2p-Oaf1p complex (lanes 7 and8). As anticipated, this Pip2p-Oaf1p complex could also be competed by adding excess SPS19 ORE but not UAS1SPS19 (lanes 5 and 6). To resolve the two overlapping promoter elements with respect to their ability to bind Adr1p, a competition EMSA was performed on labeled UAS1CTA1 using a recombinant Adr1p-LacZ fusion protein (20Eisen A. Taylor W.E. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4552-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The results demonstrated that the Adr1p-specific complex (16Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20Eisen A. Taylor W.E. Blumberg H. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4552-4556Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) formed (Fig. 2 D, lane 10) could be competed by adding excess UAS1POX1 but not POX1ORE (lanes 14 and 15). The addition of excess UAS1CTA1 or UAS1SPS19, but not SPS19ORE, gave a similar pattern of competition (lanes 11–13). Hence, it was reasoned that despite the ORE incorporated into it, the canonical UAS1POX1 represented a bona fide Adr1p element. The results also revealed an apparent intensification of the Adr1p signal in lanes containing SPS19 ORE orPOX1 ORE competitor DNA (lanes 13 and15) compared with the situation without competition (lane 10). However, this signal enhancement probably did not indicate an ORE-specific transactivation of UAS1 binding, because previous EMSAs (16Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have shown that the addition of an ORE-less competitor DNA (BUFPAL) (34Gurvitz A. Hamilton B. Hartig A. Ruis H. Dawes I.W. Rottensteiner H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) also had a similar effect. The prevalence of closely associated OREs and UAS1s among genes involved in peroxisomal processes has been reported previously (16Gurvitz A. Wabnegger L. Rottensteiner H. Dawes I.W. Hartig A. Ruis H. Hamilton B. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This raised the issue of whether the two elements cooperate to act as a transcriptional enhancer. The promoter elements in POX1 and PEX11 were deemed inappropriate for examining this potential cooperation, because in the former promoter the superimposition of the two elements is unique to this gene, whereas in the promoter of the latter gene the sequence overlapping the ORE is not a canonical UAS1. Instead, we used the CTA1 promoter (Fig.3A) to study the possible interaction between the two elements because (i) it contains a UAS1/ORE overlap, (ii) mutating either PIP2 or ADR1 did not lead to a complete loss of induced expression (Fig. 1 B), which should facilitate analysis of the combined effect of both factors, and (iii) activities of reporter genes based on dissectedCTA1 promoter fragments can be measured simultaneously with those of native catalase A using a convenient assay. UAS1CTA1 resembles the cognate sequence in the promoter ofADH2 (Fig. 3 B) in that both elements contain a second half-site at their 5′ end (Fig. 3, A andB, underlined). The minimal sequences in UAS1CTA1 and UAS1ADH2 sufficient to form protein-DNA complexes with Adr1p are indicated (Fig. 3, Aand B, brackets above sequences). By inserting the minimal UAS1CTA1, the isolated CTA1 ORE, or a stretch of DNA containing both elements (Fig. 3 C) into a basal CYC1-lacZ reporter gene, it was possible to examine these promoter regions either as dissected or combined elements. Oleic acid-induced yeast cells harboring a single copy of each of these integrative constructs were assayed for β-galactosidase and catalase activities. The results demonstrated that wild-type cells expressed the pMF14 reporter gene (containing both UAS1 and ORE) to at least a 4-fold greater extent than reporter genes consisting of either UAS1 (pMF17) or ORE (pMF22) alone (TableI). Oleic acid-dependent activation of pMF14 relied on both Adr1p and Pip2p, because a mutation of either gene reduced the levels of β-galactosidase activities to less than a fifth of the levels reached in the wild-type strain. This reduction appeared to be exacerbated in the adr1Δpip2Δ double mutant. Catalase activities measured in the same extracts substantiated the effect of both the adr1Δ and pip2Δ mutations on the expression of native CTA1 on oleic acid. Expression of the UAS1CTA1-driven reporter (pMF17) was effectively abolished in the adr1Δ mutant compared with the wild type, but also in the pip2Δ mutant only a residual activity was maintained. A similar situation was observed using the CTA1ORE-containing reporter (pMF22) in that its expression was very low in the pip2Δ mutant and only partially retained in theadr1Δ mutant (Table I).Table IThe effect of adr1Δ and pip2Δ deletions on the expression of reporter genes based on CYC1-lacZ or on native CTA1 under ethanol or oleic acid medium conditionsStrainsβ-Galactosidase activityRelative levelCatalase activityEthanolOleic acidEthanolOleic acidnmol min−1/mg of proteinunits/mg of proteinbasal reporter (pMF6b)MF6 wild type10.13.9191.0526.3MF6adr1Δ27.84.310.349.1MF6pip2Δ13.42.2107.652.7MF6adr1Δpip2Δ25.16.319.011.9both UAS1CTA1 and CTA1 ORE (pM14)MF14 wild type74.7289.074.191.2463.5MF14adr1Δ24.248.610.643.8MF14pip2Δ66.111.291.843.7MF14adr1Δpip2Δ27.52.817.14.4UAS1CTA1 only (pMF17)MF17 wild type41.666.617.178.5248.3MF17adr1Δ2.21.511.429.6MF17pip2Δ40.015.881.655.3MF17adr1Δpip2Δ1.72.113.47.6CTA1 ORE only (pMF22)MF22 wild type13.650.713.075.0307.5MF22adr1Δ14.219.415.721.3MF22pip2Δ19.91.868.166.7MF22adr1Δpip2Δ11.22.714.89.4All measurements were performed in duplicate.aIntegrative plasmid pMF6 is loaded with a basal CYC1-lacZ reporter gene, whereas the remaining plasmids also contain CTA1 promoter fragments as follows: pMF14, −226 to −156 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start site; pMF17, −184 to −156 nucleotides; and pMF22, −214 to −184 nucleotides (21Filipits M.

Simon M.M. Rapatz W. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). On ethanol, Adr1p predominated over Pip2p-Oaf1p in regulatingCTA1, as judged by both types of enzyme activities (TableI). This was in agreement with current understanding of Pip2p-Oaf1p function that stipulates it is inactive in the absence of fatty acids (37Baumgartner U. Hamilton B. Piskacek M. Ruis H. Rottensteiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22208-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, on oleic acid CTA1 ORE and UAS1CTA1 acted in synergy to enhance CTA1expression. This indicated that a close association of these two elements in other dually regulated genes such as POX1 and potentially also in PEX11 might also act synergistically. Yeast cells devoid of Adr1p fail to utilize oleic acid as a sole carbon source or to expand their peroxisomal compartment (5Simon M. Adam G. Rapatz W. Spevak W. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the present study, the probable cause for this dual phenotype was revealed to be a defect in the expression of Pox1p and Pex11p. Although both FOX2 (encoding peroxisomal multifunctional enzyme type 2) (38Hiltunen J.K. Wenzel B. Beyer A. Erdmann R. Fosså A. Kunau W.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6646-6653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and POT1/FOX3 (encoding peroxisomal thiolase) (39Igual J.C. Matallana E. Gonzalez-Bosch C. Franco L. Perez-Ortin J.E. Yeast. 1991; 7: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,40Einerhand A.W. Voorn-Brouwer T.M. Erdmann R. Kunau W.-H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have been shown previously to be influenced by Adr1p (5Simon M. Adam G. Rapatz W. Spevak W. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 14Igual J.C. Navarro B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 446-455PubMed Google Scholar), it was hitherto not clear to what extent the carbon flux through β-oxidation would be perturbed in adr1Δ mutant cells. This uncertainty was highlighted by the detection of relatively large amounts of Pot1p/Fox3p in adr1Δ cells compared with cells devoid of Pip2p-Oaf1p (Fig. 1 A). However, unlike the situation with Pot1p/Fox3p, Adr1p was shown here to regulate Pox1p expression very tightly. This strict dependence of the β-oxidation spiral on Adr1p explains why adr1Δ mutants fail to degrade oleic acid. Adr1p control was also demonstrated for PEX11, as determined by transcriptional analysis and immunoblotting. A direct role for Adr1p in regulating PEX11 remains to be demonstrated, because in contrast to POX1, the PEX11 promoter does not contain a canonical UAS1. Nevertheless, because of the occurrence of an ORE-overlapping sequence in the PEX11 promoter with only one mismatch to the UAS1 consensus, it is at least plausible that Adr1p might bind the PEX11 promoter. The possibility that the tandem array of UAS1 half-sites in the vicinity of the PEX11ATG start site (at position −42) could also represent a functional Adr1p element cannot be ruled out entirely, because at least in the case of the GUT1 gene, such linearly arranged half-site pairs have been shown previously to bind Adr1p (36Grauslund M. Lopes J.M. Rønnow B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4391-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 41Pavlik P. Simon M. Schuster T. Ruis H. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mutant cells lacking Pex11p or Pox1p resemble each other in that their peroxisomes appear enlarged, albeit reduced in number (4Van Roermund C.W. Tabak H.F. Van Den Berg M. Wanders R.J. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that this shared phenotype is caused by the absence of a putative metabolic signal generated via medium-chain fatty acid β-oxidation. A significant reduction (5-fold) in peroxisome abundance is also observed in human cell lines lacking peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (3Chang C.-C. South S. Warren D. Jones J. Moser A.B. Moser H.W. Gould S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1579-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By extrapolating this situation to yeastadr1Δ cells defective in peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase (Pox1p) activity, the peroxisome proliferation phenotype ofadr1Δ cells might also turn out to be secondary to blocked β-oxidation (4Van Roermund C.W. Tabak H.F. Van Den Berg M. Wanders R.J. Hettema E.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, unlike the enlarged peroxisomes observed inpox1Δ or pex11Δ cells, the few peroxisomes seen in adr1Δ and pip2Δ mutant cells are unusually small. We propose that the reason for the small peroxisomes in these latter two mutant strains is because they contain less matrix enzymes and membrane proteins compared with wild-type peroxisomes, because of an absence of bulk transcription mediated by Adr1p and Pip2p-Oaf1p. Using a basal CYC1-lacZ reporter gene, the significance of overlapping UAS1/ORE elements prevalent among oleic acid-inducible genes was addressed. This revealed that the combined potential for transcriptional activation of the isolatedCTA1 ORE and UAS1CTA1 was about 2.5-fold less than that conferred on the basal promoter by the arrangement found in the native promoter. This indicated synergy between the respective Pip2p-Oaf1p and Adr1p transcription factors. The argument for synergy was further supported by the observation that expression of the ORE reporter (pMF22) in the adr1Δ mutant or the UAS1 reporter (pMF17) in the pip2Δ mutant was less compared with that in the wild-type strain. It is attractive to postulate that for efficient expression of certain oleic acid-regulated genes, an enhanceosome-like (42Merika M. Thanos D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) transient complex might be formed in vivo between the oleic acid-specific Pip2p-Oaf1p transcription factor and the more general sensor of less-favored carbon sources, Adr1p. This postulate must take into account dual occupancy of the two transcription factors in such promoters where ORE and UAS1 overlap. Pip2p-Oaf1p can bind and weakly activate single half-sites within OREs (21Filipits M. Simon M.M. Rapatz W. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Einerhand A.W. Kos W.T. Distel B. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similarly, Adr1p can bind each of the two half-sites in UAS1 independently of each other (12Cheng C. Kacherovsky N. Dombek K.M. Camier S. Thukral S.K. Rhim E. Young E.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3842-3852Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that not all of the contact sites within the corresponding palindromes are occupied simultaneously by Pip2p-Oaf1p and Adr1p in such overlapping element arrangements. Finally, analysis of the PIP2 promoter revealed a sequence overlapping the PIP2 ORE with some semblance to UAS1, at position −124 (CTCCGGAGN3 CTCCAA). In addition, theOAF1 promoter was also found to contain a potential UAS1 (CTCCAGN28CTGGGG) at position −392. Adr1p might turn out to influence the transcription of PIP2 and/orOAF1, thereby adding another layer of (indirect) control over genes subordinate to Pip2p-Oaf1p. Further work is required to determine whether in this way Adr1p heads the transcriptional hierarchy leading to oleic acid induction and peroxisome proliferation."

We concluded that H7 inhibits constitutive C-terminal phosphorylation of p53, which regulates its turnover in unstressed cells. We now show that p53 and its inhibitor MDM2 (HDM2 in human cells) are together in the nuclei of H7-treated cells and can be co-immunoprecipitated. Despite this association of p53 with the ubiquitin ligase MDM2, ubiquitinated p53 was not detected in H7-treated cells. Furthermore, co-treatment with H7 and the proteosome inhibitor LLnL prevented the accumulation of ubiquitinated p53 that was observed in cells treated solely with LLnL. In addition, treatment of cells with the PKC activator phorbol ester stimulated the ubiquitination of p53 and reduced its ability to accumulate after stress. H7 did not induce the phosphorylation of human p53 on Ser-15 (Ser-18 in mouse protein), a modification that occurs in response to DNA damage and leads to the release of MDM2 and to transactivation by p53.

Activated p53 moves to the nucleus, where it binds to specific DNA sequences and regulates the expression of many genes involved in the cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair (8Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar,9Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The p53 response has three distinct aspects: stabilization of the protein leads to its accumulation, activation of its ability to bind to DNA allows it to localize to specific promoters, and activation of its transactivation domain allows it to interact with the basal transcriptional machinery. All three aspects are regulated by post-translational modification on multiple sites, especially phosphorylation (10Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 76-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Stress-induced N-terminal phosphorylations increase the stability of p53 and its ability to interact with the transcriptional machinery, whereas phosphorylation and acetylation of the C-terminal domain facilitates DNA binding. In unstressed cells, the level of wild-type p53 is low because of its short half-life (5–20 min). After induction, the lifetime increases severalfold (11Maltzman W. Czyzyk L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar, 12Price B.D. Calderwood S.K. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3055-3062PubMed Google Scholar). The proteosome-mediated degradation of p53 is regulated by ubiquitination. The oncoprotein MDM2 (HDM2 in human cells) is a ubiquitin ligase that modifies p53 in its C-terminal domain after it binds to the N-terminal domain (13Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). p53 in turn regulates the transcription of mdm2 (14Barak Y. Juven T. Haffner R. Oren M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar), thus forming a feedback loop (15Wu X. Bayle J.H. Olson D. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1126-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar) that keeps the level of p53 low. The importance of this regulation is highlighted by the embryonic lethality of a homozygous deletion ofmdm2 and the rescue of this lethality by the additional deletion of both copies of the p53 gene (16Montes de Oca L.R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). MDM2 also regulates the activity of p53. When bound to the N-terminal transactivation domain, MDM2 inhibits the ability of p53 to interact with transcription factors such as the TATA-binding protein (17Thut C.J. Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1974-1986Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Stresses induce multiple phosphorylations of the N-terminal domain of p53 (18Appella E. Anderson C.W. Pathol.

Phosphorylation of Ser-15 stimulates p53-dependent transactivation and increases the interaction of p53 with the histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300 and PCAF, co-activators of transcription (31Dumaz N.

ARF, a product of the p16INK4a locus, binds to MDM2, preventing the degradation of p53. Adenovirus E1a, MYC, and RAS promote the accumulation of p53 by inducing the expression of ARF (36de Stanchina E. McCurrach M.E. Zindy F. Shieh S.Y. Ferbeyre G. Samuelson A.V. Prives C. Roussel M.F.

When ARF is overexpressed, ARF/MDM2 complexes accumulate in the nucleoli, preventing p53 from moving from the nucleus to the cytosol, where it can be degraded (39Weber J.D. Kuo M.L. Bothner B. Di Giammarino E.L. Kriwacki R.W. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The C-terminal regulatory domain of p53 regulates its ability to bind to DNA, and deletion of this domain activates DNA binding constitutively (40Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of C-terminal serine residues or binding of the antibody PAb421 to a C-terminal epitope activates the DNA binding activity of p53 (41Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), as does the acetylation of C-terminal lysine residues by CBP/p300 and PCAF (42Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain is also involved in regulating the degradation of p53, because deletion of as few as 16 C-terminal amino acids significantly decreases MDM2-dependent turnover (43Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the constitutive phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of p53, probably by protein kinase C (PKC), is likely to help to regulate the stability of p53 in unstressed cells. Treatment of mouse or human fibroblasts with the PKC inhibitors H7 or bisindolylmaleimide I increased the half-life of p53, thus causing it to accumulate. In vivo labeling with [32P]orthophosphate of cells and analysis of p53-specific phosphopeptides revealed that the phosphorylation of a peptide from the C-terminal domain that contains a consensus PKC site was reduced upon treatment with H7 (44Chernov M.V. Ramana C.V. Adler V.V. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2284-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have now investigated the mechanism by which p53 is stabilized in response to H7 and demonstrate that preventing the constitutive C-terminal phosphorylation of p53 by PKC prevents ubiquitination without affecting the formation of p53-MDM2 complexes. Stimulation of PKC by phorbol ester induced the ubiquitination of p53 in response to UV and inhibited its accumulation. Mouse (12)1/CA fibroblasts carrying a p53-responsive β-galactosidase reporter construct have been described (45Chernov M.V. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RKO cells were obtained from Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. H7 and phorbol ester were obtained from Sigma. Total RNA was extracted by using the TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein extractions and Western analyses were performed as described by Chernov and Stark (45Chernov M.V. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped into 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and collected in Eppendorf tubes. After centrifugation at 2000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C, the cells were resuspended in up to 100 µl of NET (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) buffer with 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmbenzamidine, 1 µg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, and 1 mm sodium vanadate and incubated for 10 min on ice. After vortexing for 20 s, the debris was precipitated by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Mouse p53 was detected with the monoclonal antibodies PAb421 and PAb240 (gifts of A. Levine, Rockefeller University, New York, NY). Human p53 was detected by using the DO-1 antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). MDM2 and HDM2 were detected by using antibody 2A10 (a gift of M. E. Perry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Human or mouse p53 phosphorylated on Ser-15 was detected by using the phospho-p53 (Ser-15) antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) and goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Rockland Immunochemicals Inc.) were detected with the Renaissance chemoluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 2% formaldehyde in PBS and then with methanol at room temperature for 12 min each, washed five times with PBS, and blocked for 1 h in Hanks' solution with 5% fetal calf serum and 20 mm Hepes pH 7.8. The coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary anti-MDM2 antibody IF2 (CalBiochem). After three washes in PBS-Tween 20, the cells were treated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Sigma). The cells were washed three times in PBS-Tween 20 with 1 µg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in the second wash, and the coverslips were mounted by using 20 µl of Vectashield (Vector Laboratories Inc.). p53-HDM2 complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-HDM2 SMP14 (BD Biosciences/PharMingen) according to Picksley et al. (46Picksley S.M. Vojtesek B. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2523-2529PubMed Google Scholar), except that 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was used. Briefly, the cells were lysed for 20 min on ice, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g. Antibody SMP14 (2 µg) was added to 10 mg of total protein, and the mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Antibody complexes were captured on GammaBind G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by rocking the mixture at 4 °C for 1 h. The Sepharose-bound complex was washed four times in cold lysis buffer, and the proteins were denatured in 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, and 1.3 m β-mercaptoethanol) and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% acrylamide). After the transfer, the membranes were cut to separate p53 from HDM2; p53 was detected by using DO-1-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and HDM2 was detected with 2A10. For analysis of ubiquitination, p53 was immunoprecipitated by using anti-p53 polyclonal antibody C-19 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) according to the same protocol. We examined the ability of the p53 that accumulated in mouse (12)1/CA cells treated with H7 to activate transcription, compared with the p53 that accumulated in cells treated with the proteosome inhibitor LLnL (20Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Both treatments caused a substantial increase in the levels of p53 (Fig.1A, lanes 3 and4), comparable with the levels found in UV-irradiated cells (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Despite the high levels of p53, there was only a very small increase in β-galactosidase, the expression of which is regulated in these cells by a p53-dependent promoter (Fig. 1 B). However, when the cells were treated with either inhibitor for 6 h and then irradiated with UV, there was a substantial induction of β-galactosidase (Fig. 1 B), indicating that H7 does not activate pathways that respond to DNA damage and that it causes latent p53 to accumulate by an unknown mechanism. The level and activity of p53 are regulated by HDM2 (MDM2 in mouse cells). Decreased levels of HDM2 or its compartmentalization in nucleoli prevents HDM2 from binding to p53 and transporting it out of the nuclei, leading to its accumulation. We demonstrated previously that p53 accumulates in the nuclei of H7-treated cells (44Chernov M.V. Ramana C.V. Adler V.V. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2284-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To determine the role of HDM2 in this process, we examined the expression levels and location of this protein. The amount of hdm2 mRNA in RKO cells treated with H7 remains the same for 1–2 h, then decreases (Fig.2A). The amount of HDM2 protein changes little up to 6 h after treatment (Fig.2 B). Similar observations were made in mouse cells (data not shown). During this time, the level of p53 protein increases significantly. RKO cells treated with H7 for 4 h showed no change in HDM2 localization or level compared with untreated cells (Fig.2 C). The dispersed pattern of staining indicates an even distribution of HDM2 in the nucleus, suggesting that it is available to interact with p53. These data suggest that compartmentalization or changes in the amount of HDM2 are unlikely to be responsible for the accumulation of p53. Phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain is the hallmark of the response of p53 to DNA damage and is important for stabilizing and activating the protein. The phosphorylation of murine Ser-18 (Ser-15 in human p53) by several different protein kinases following many types of cellular insults indicates that modification of this site is pivotal in p53-mediated stress responses (19Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar, 20Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B.

The latency of the p53 that accumulates after proteosomes are inhibited by LLnL is due to the absence of N-terminal phosphorylation, including the phosphorylation of Ser-15 (19Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). Because latent p53 accumulated in cells treated with either H7 or LLnL, we compared the phosphorylation of Ser-18/Ser-15 after either treatment in mouse (12)1/CA fibroblasts and human RKO cells. The cells were treated with UV, H7, and LLnL, individually or in combination, and the phosphorylation of Ser-18/Ser-15 was measured by using anti-P-Ser-15 antibodies. The antibodies PAb240 (mouse) and DO-1 (human) were used to determine the total amount of p53 in each sample. Treatment with either H7 or LLnL did not lead to phosphorylation of Ser-18/Ser-15 after 6 h (Fig.3A, lanes 3 and4). A little phosphorylation of Ser-15 was observed in RKO cells 12 h after treatment with H7, probably because of the stress of prolonged exposure to the inhibitor (Fig. 3 B). This late, low level phosphorylation of Ser-15 is consistent with our earlier result that a low level of p53-dependent gene expression is observed in cells treated with H7 for a long time (44Chernov M.V. Ramana C.V. Adler V.V. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2284-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). As expected, simultaneous treatment with H7 plus UV, or with LLnL plus UV, induced significant phosphorylation of Ser-18/Ser-15 in either mouse or human cells (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 6). The amount of phosphorylated p53 in co-treated cells was equal to or higher than the levels in cells treated with UV alone (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 3 and 4 to 5 and6). The levels of Ser-18/Ser-15 phosphorylation correlate with the amounts of p53 protein. The interaction of p53 with HDM2 is a critical event in p53 degradation. In RKO cells treated with H7, we did not detect any phosphorylation of Ser-15. In contrast, the phosphorylation of Ser-15 is frequently observed in parallel with stress-induced dissociation of the p53-HDM2 complex. Furthermore, p53 and HDM2 are both in the nuclei of H7-treated cells (Fig. 2 C). The p53-HDM2 interaction can be blocked by the phosphorylation of Thr-18 or Ser-20, which are in the HDM2 binding site of p53. To analyze the mechanism of p53 stabilization more directly, we tested for the presence of p53-HDM2 complexes (Fig.4). RKO cells were irradiated with UV or treated with H7, and HDM2 was immunoprecipitated 1, 2, 3, or 4 h after treatment. As a positive control, cells were treated with LLnL for 4 h. Proteosome inhibitors cause the accumulation of unmodified p53, which is in a complex with HDM2 (19Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1760) Google Scholar). A fraction of each extract was analyzed by direct Western to monitor the levels of p53 and HDM2 (Fig. 4 A). The levels of HDM2 were comparable in H7- and UV-treated cells, remained the same for up to 3 h after treatment, and started to decrease in the case of H7 (or to increase in the case of UV) (Fig. 4 A, lanes 2–5). LLnL caused significant accumulation of both proteins (Fig. 4 A,lane 6), as expected, because both HDM2 and p53 are degraded by proteosomes (47Chang Y.C. Lee Y.S. Tejima T. Tanaka K. Omura S. Heintz N.H. Mitsui Y. Magae J. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of HDM2 immunoprecipitated from the cells by using the SMP14 antibody reflected the changes shown by direct Western analysis (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the amount of p53 co-immunoprecipitated with HDM2 differed dramatically after these two treatments. In response to H7, the levels of p53 increased gradually for 4 h, despite declining amounts of HDM2, indicating that the accumulated p53 binds to HDM2. As expected, the p53 that accumulated after UV treatment was not bound to HDM2 and only a slight increase in co-precipitated p53 was observed after 4 h, in parallel with the increase in the level of HDM2. In the positive control, large amounts of p53 were complexed with HDM2 after treatment with LLnL (Fig.4 B, lane 13). Degradation by proteosomes is the major way in which p53 levels are regulated. When p53 accumulates because proteosomes are inhibited, one can observe several differently ubiquitinated forms (48Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar). In untreated cells, the lifetimes of the ubiquitinated forms of p53 are so short that they are not readily detected. We determined whether treatment with H7 affects the ubiquitination of p53. Total p53, immunoprecipitated from (12)1/CA or RKO cells using polyclonal antibodies specific for the C-terminal domain, was analyzed. No ubiquitinated p53 was detected in control cells or in cells treated with UV or H7 (Fig.5). As expected, treatment with LLnL induced the accumulation of several ubiquitinated forms with higher apparent molecular weights. Consistent with the observed phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain and the loss of MDM2 binding, treatment with UV reduced the levels of ubiquitination in LLnL treated samples. Surprisingly, despite the presence of p53-HDM2 complexes in H7-treated mouse cells, treatment with H7 completely abolished the ubiquitination of p53. A similar effect was observed in human RKO cells, although a little ubiquitinated p53 could be observed in the untreated cells in this case. UV irradiation reduced the basal levels of ubiquitination in RKO cells, and treatment with H7 blocked ubiquitination completely. Because phorbol ester activates PKC, we tested its effect on p53. Pretreatment of mouse (12)1/CA fibroblasts with phorbol ester for 6 h partially inhibited the accumulation of p53 in response to stress without affecting the basal level (Ref. 44Chernov M.V.

There was no detectable increase in the ubiquitination of p53 in cells in which the UV-induced accumulation of p53 was inhibited by phorbol ester (Fig. 6 A,lanes 7 and 8). We detected a very faint band that migrates at the same position as ubiquitinated p53 only after immunoprecipitation of p53 from approximately five times more cell extract than was used in the direct Western analysis (Fig.6 B, lanes 2 and 8). The capacity of the degradation machinery seems to be high enough to deal with the increased amount of p53 targeted for degradation. Because the ubiquitinated forms of p53 were detected in (12)1/CA cells only after proteosomes were inhibited by LLnL, we used LLnL to expose the effect of phorbol ester on p53 ubiquitination and in this way detected an increase in the amount of ubiquitinated p53 in cells co-treated with UV and phorbol ester (Fig. 6 B, lanes 5 and6). This result suggests that activated PKC might stimulate ubiquitination, thus down-regulating the accumulation of p53 in response to stress. It is well established that post-translational modification is the major mechanism regulating the stabilization and activation of p53 in response to DNA damage (9Oren M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36031-36034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Several stress-induced pathways mediate phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of p53, leading to inhibition of the p53-MDM2 interaction, simultaneously stabilizing p53 and facilitating its activation as a transcription factor, making these two aspects of stress-induced p53 activation mutually interdependent. However, Hupp et al. (40Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) demonstrated that low doses of UV could induce p53-dependent transcription without stabilizing the protein, and we have found that sodium salicylate can inhibit the ability of p53 to transactivate without affecting its stability (45Chernov M.V. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of PKC can stabilize a latent form of p53 that is incapable of inducing transcription (44Chernov M.V. Ramana C.V. Adler V.V. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2284-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The mechanisms involved in regulating p53 can be divided into those that stabilize and activate p53 in cells exposed to stress and those that operate in unstressed cells, and it is relevant to note that we have recently shown that the basal level of p53 mRNA is maintained through a RAS-dependent mechanism in unstressed cells (49Agarwal M.L. Chilakamarti V.R. Hamilton M. Taylor W.R. DePrimo S.E. Bean L.J.H. Agarwal A. Agarwal M.K. Wolfman A. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2527-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Modifications of the C-terminal domains of p53 play a major role in regulating its ability to bind to DNA. There are two well characterized phosphorylation sites in this domain. One includes Ser-392, which is phosphorylated by casein kinase II, and another, containing Ser-376 and Ser-378, is phosphorylated by PKC. Phosphorylation of both sites in vitro by the appropriate kinases stimulates the DNA binding activity of p53 (41Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, although the phosphorylation of Ser-392 is induced in response to DNA damage (50Lu H. Taya Y. Ikeda M. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6399-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of the PKC site has never been observed in vivo, even when cells were treated with phorbol ester or other activators of PKC (51Milne D.M. McKendrick L. Jardine L.J. Deacon E. Lord J.M. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 205-211PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, Waterman et al. (52Waterman M.J. Stavridi E.S. Waterman J.L. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) have shown that in response to ionizing radiation, the PKC site is dephosphorylated, creating binding sites for 14-3-3 proteins. The data suggest that, despite the similar effects of these modifications on p53 in vitro, their in vivo roles may be quite different. As mentioned above, inhibiting PKC stabilizes p53 and activating it destabilizes p53, indicating that the constitutive phosphorylation of the PKC site is likely to play a role in regulating the degradation of p53 in unstressed cells. Under stress, p53 is stabilized by inhibiting its binding to MDM2. In H7-treated cells, the N-terminal domain of p53 was not phosphorylated, and the MDM2-p53 complex was still intact, although the ubiquitination of p53 was inhibited. These observations suggest an alternative mechanism for regulating the degradation of p53 in unstressed cells. Phosphorylation of the C-terminus plays an important role in the allosteric regulation of p53 activity (40Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 53Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). According to the current model, the unphosphorylated C-terminal domain blocks the DNA-binding domain (40Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The same interaction can protect multiple lysine residues that are located near the PKC site and are required for ubiquitination and degradation (54Nakamura S. Roth J.A. Mukhopadhyay T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9391-9398Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 55Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We have found that, in HeLa cells, a human adenocarcinoma cell line in which the level of p53 is low because of the viral oncoprotein E6, the induction of p53 by UV and H7 is severely impaired. In contrast, treatment with LLnL still induces the accumulation of p53 (Ref. 44Chernov M.V. Ramana C.V. Adler V.V. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2284-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar and data not shown). E6 binds to two distinct sites in p53, and the one in the DNA binding domain (56Li X. Coffino P. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4509-4516Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is required to stimulate the degradation of p53. The binding of E6 to the core domain probably inhibits its interaction with the C-terminal domain, making the latter available for ubiquitination by E6AP even when the PKC site is not phosphorylated. Interestingly, deletion of 16 C-terminal amino acids protected p53 against MDM2-dependent degradation, but the same protein could still be degraded when E6 was overexpressed (43Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This observation correlates very well with the suggested allosteric mechanism of the regulation of p53 degradation by the C-terminal domain. In response to DNA damage, p53 is regulated not only by phosphorylation but also by acetylation (57Liu L. Scolnick D.M. Trievel R.C. Zhang H.B. Marmorstein R. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1202-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Primarily, acetylation is involved in regulating the DNA binding activity of p53 (42Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar), but because both acetylation and ubiquitination occur on the same C-terminal lysine residues, acetylation may also be involved indirectly in stabilizing p53 (58Kobet E. Zeng X. Zhu Y. Keller D. Lu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12547-12552Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-378 in the PKC site negatively regulates acetylation of the C-terminal domain (59Sakaguchi K. Herrera J.E. Saito S. Miki T. Bustin M. Vassilev A. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), suggesting that deacetylation can enhance the ubiquitination of p53 in unstressed cells. The p53 bound to the p21 promoter in UV-irradiated cells reacts with antibody PAb421 (60Shaulian E. Schreiber M. Piu F. Beeche M. Wagner E.F. Karin M. Cell. 2000; 103: 897-907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that it is not phosphorylated at the PKC site because phosphorylation of this site inhibits recognition by PAb421 (41Hupp T.R. Lane D.P. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). An involvement of PKC-dependent phosphorylation in the degradation of p53 would also explain why it is difficult to detect phosphorylation of p53 at the C-terminal site even after treating cells with phorbol ester (51Milne D.M. McKendrick L. Jardine L.J. Deacon E. Lord J.M. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 205-211PubMed Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the inhibition of p53 function by phorbol ester is due to increased degradation, indicating that p53 is targeted for degradation before it can be activated by stress-dependent pathways through N-terminal phosphorylation and explaining why the PKC site has to be dephosphorylated to allow p53 to be activated in response to DNA damage. All together, our data show that the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of p53 by PKC represents an important mechanism of negative regulation in unstressed cells, preventing the acetylation of this domain and blocking its interaction with factors such as 14-3-3, which stimulate the ability of p53 to bind to DNA. This phosphorylation by PKC also regulates the constitutive degradation of p53 in unstressed cells by stimulating ubiquitination. The vital role of tight negative regulation of p53 in unstressed cells is highlighted by the dramatic effect of the deletion of mdm2 on mouse development, apparent in cells that have p53 although not in p53-null cells (16Montes de Oca L.R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar). We thank Arnold Levine and Mary E. Perry for a generous supply of monoclonal antibodies."

However, molecular cloning has established that at least five isoforms of full-length PAP can be generated by alternative RNA processing (15Raabe T. Bollum F.J. Manley J.L.

It is also known that phosphorylation contributes to the multiplicity of PAP (9Ballantyne S. Bilger A. Åström J. Virtanen A. Wickens M. RNA (N.

Recently it has been established that PAP and PAP-related genes are present in the human genome (11Lee Y.J. Lee Y. Chung J.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Kashiwabara S. Zhuang T. Yamagata K. Noguchi J. Fukamizu A. Baba T. Dev.

Nature. 2001; 409: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Therefore, so far at least three distinct mechanisms can generate multiple isoforms of PAP: gene duplication, alternative RNA processing, and post-translational modification. These phenomena unexpectedly increase the diversity of PAP and raise questions about the functional significance of multiple PAPs in vivo. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that different PAPs are responsible for different functions in vivo, because PAP participates in a whole set of different reactions, e.g. RNA cleavage at the poly(A) site and AAUAAA-dependent or -independent poly(A) tail synthesis (23Sheets M.D. Wickens M. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1401-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 24Wittmann T. Wahle E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Biochemical fractionation studies have indicated that different forms of PAP reside at different subcellular compartments (16Thuresson A.-C. Åström J. Åström A. Grönvik K.-O. Virtanen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Ryner L.C. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4229-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A testis-specific PAP has been identified, suggesting that some isoforms of PAP are restricted to certain developmental stages or tissues (11Lee Y.J. Lee Y. Chung J.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 487: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Kashiwabara S. Zhuang T. Yamagata K. Noguchi J. Fukamizu A. Baba T. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this report we have molecularly cloned the human 90-kDa PAP isoform, previously identified in HeLa nuclear extracts. The 90-kDa isoform is encoded by a distinct locus recently identified as a PAP-related gene (22Tupler R. Perini G. Green M.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The gene has been named PAPOLG, and its product is hsPAPγ. In a recent report (14Perumal K. Sinha K. Henning D. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21791-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) the same gene was implicated in monoadenylation of small RNAs. Here, we show that hsPAPγ is abona fide poly(A) polymerase harboring both nonspecific and CPSF/AAUAAA-dependent polyadenylation activity. hsPAPγ is exclusively localized in the nucleus. Full-length hsPAPγ and various deletion mutants were molecularly cloned by a standard RT-PCR procedure using the following strategy. A 371-amino acid N-terminal fragment of hsPAPγ was amplified by RT-PCR using HeLa total RNA and primersa and b, subcloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega Inc.), and further subcloned into the pET-32(a) vector (Novagen Inc.) between the NcoI and SacI sites. The resulting clone was called pPAPγ(H1–371), where H denotes the N-terminal tag and the numbers refer to amino acids in full-length hsPAPγ. C-terminal deletions of hsPAPγ were cloned by inserting PCR products derived with primer pairs c–d, c–e,c–f, and c–g between the EcoRI andSacI sites of pPAPγ(H1–371) giving rise to pPAPγ(H1–493), pPAPγ(H1–506), pPAPγ(H1–575), and pPAP(H1–683), respectively. The C terminus of hsPAPγ was identified and cloned into pGEM-T vector by 3′-RACE using theCLONTECH Smart Race cDNA amplification kit and gene-specific primers h and i according to the manufacturer. After identification of the C-terminal end, including the stop codon, primer pair c–j was used for generation of pPAPγ(H1–736) as described above. An N-terminal deletion mutant was amplified using primer pair k–j for deletion of the first 16 amino acids and the resulting clone was named pPAPγ(H17–736). The clone pPAPγ(H521–683) was generated as outlined above using primers l and g. The pET-32(a) vector introduces an N-terminal thioredoxin-tag which increases the expression of the soluble recombinant protein, a histidine-tag and an S-tag enabling easy purification via affinity chromatography. Full-length hsPAPγ and one C-terminal deletion mutant were also subcloned into the pCAL-c vector (Stratagene) between theNcoI and KpnI sites, using the same strategy as above (primer pairs a–j and a–g) giving rise to pPAPγ(1–736C) and pPAPγ(1–683C), respectively. Full-length hsPAPγ and C-terminal deletion mutants were also subcloned into the EGFP-C2 vector (CLONTECH) between theXhoI and KpnI sites using primer pairsm–b, m–e, and m–j. The resulting clones were named pPAPγ(EGFP1–371), pPAPγ(EGFP1–506), and pPAP(EGFP1–736), respectively. Primers used were as follows: (a) 5′-CACCATGGAAGAGATGTCTGCAAACACC-3′; (b) 5′-GAGAGCTCTTAGGTACCCCTATACTTTTGAAAGAAATTCGGTGG-3′; (c) 5′-GCCTGTCTGGGATCCTCGGGT-3′; (d) 5′-GAGAGCTCTTAGGTACCGTGAAGTTGTTTTTTCTTTACATGAGTTGC-3′; (e) 5′-GAGAGCTCTTAGGTACCCTTTTTCTTCTTTTGAAGAATTTCTGC-3′; (f) 5′-GAGAGCTCTTAGGTACCACTCAGTGGCTTCTCCACAATTACA-3′; (g) 5′-GAGAGCTCTTAGGTACCTTTTCTTTTTCTTTCTTCAGCAGTGCG-3′; (h) 5′-CAACACCTCACAACCCTGCCCA-3′; (i) 5′-GAGATCCCATTCCCCATCCATAG-3′; (j) 5′-GAGAGGTACCAAGCCGATTAAGGGTCAGTCG-3′; (k) 5′-CACCATGGGAAAGCATTATGGAATTACCTC-3′; (l) 5′-CACCATGGAATCCAAAAGATTGTCTCTGGATAGC-3′; and (m) 5′-CACACTCGAGGCAATGGAAGAGATGTCTGCAAAC-3′. Restriction sites for cloning are included in the primer sequences shown in boldface: NcoI in a; KpnI andSacI in b, d, e,f, and g and XhoI in m. A stop codon was introduced between the KpnI andSacI sites. The KpnI restriction site was introduced to enable cloning into the pCALc vector and adds two extra amino acids at the C terminus of all the pET-32a clones expressing hsPAPγ. The NcoI cloning site in primer aintroduces a point mutation at the second amino acid in the sequence changing lysine to glutamate. All clones have been sequenced using the Big-Dye Terminator sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Buffer A (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.5m KCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 1.0% Tween-20, 10% glycerol, 5 mm imidazole, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol (b-MEOH)), buffer B (buffer A omitting detergents and b-MEOH), buffer C (20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 200 mm imidazole), buffer D (buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole), buffer E (buffer D omitting detergents and b-MEOH and containing 0.05 m KCl), buffer F (buffer E containing 200 mm imidazole), buffer G (20 mmHepes/KOH, pH 8.8, 0.05 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm DTT, 1.5 mm MgCl2), buffer H (buffer G containing 0.5 m KCl), buffer I (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm Mg, 2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm imidazole, 10 mmb-MeOH), buffer J (buffer I containing 0.2 m KCl), buffer K (buffer I omitting b-MEOH, containing 0.25 m KCl), buffer L (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 1.5 mm MgCl2). Expression plasmids were used to transform BL21(DE3) pLysSEscherichia coli strains. One colony was used for inoculation of 50–100 ml of TB medium in the presence of 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37 °C without shaking. The 50- to 100-ml culture was inoculated into a final 0.5- to 1-liter culture in TB medium containing antibiotics. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C (vigorous shaking) and were induced with 0.42 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside plus 0.524 mm MgCl2 at A600∼ 0.5–1.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 3 h post-induction, and pellets were frozen at −70 °C. Extracts for His-tagged PAPγ were prepared by unthawing the cells on ice and lysing with buffer A containing 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors), followed by sonication (three times 10 s), centrifugation 20 min at 39,000 × g, and 0.45-μm filtration. Extracts were mixed with 1 ml of Talon metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) equilibrated in buffer A, and proteins were bound batch-wise by 1-h rotation. The resin was washed with buffer A and subsequently washed with buffer B, and the proteins were eluted with buffer C. The eluate was loaded onto a HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer D. The column was washed with buffer D and subsequently with buffer E. Proteins were eluted with buffer F. The eluate was loaded on a Heparin HiTrap column equilibrated in buffer G, washed with the same buffer and proteins were eluted with buffer H. Extracts for calmodulin-tagged PAPγ where prepared as described above, but cells were lysed in buffer I containing 1 tablet of EDTA-free protease inhibitors. Extracts were mixed batch-wise with 0.75 ml of calmodulin affinity resin (Stratagene) equilibrated in buffer I, and proteins were bound overnight. The resin was washed with buffer J followed by buffer K. Proteins were eluted with buffer L. Protease inhibitors 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1.0 μg/ml aprotinin were added freshly to all buffer solutions, and all procedures were performed at 4 °C. Polyclonal antiserum specific for the C-terminal of hsPAPγ were generated by immunizing two rabbits using 0.45 mg/rabbit recombinant purified PAPγ(H521–683) polypeptide, followed by three boost injections with the same amount of antigen. The sera was named anti-PAPγ. Peptide antiserum specific for PAPII was purchased from Sigma-Genosys using a synthetic peptide (N-terminal: CKTSSTDLSDIPA) corresponding to amino acids 715–726 of hsPAPII for immunization, and was named anti-PAPIIex22. Monoclonal antibodies were Y12 (26Pettersson I. Hinterberger M. Mimori T. Gottleib C. Steitz J.A. J. Biol.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to a previous study (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar) as was Western blotting (28Jareborg N. Burnett S. J. Gen. Vir. 1991; 72: 2269-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Detection was done by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:1000, and ECL plus chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nonspecific polyadenylation activity assays were carried out as described previously (21Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) with modifications optimizing the activity; the reaction mixture (25 μl) contained: 100 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.6 (measured at room temperature), 40 mm KCl, 0.040 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 9 units of RNasin (ribonuclease inhibitor), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm cold ATP, 1.2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 2 μm oligoA15 (Dharmacon), and the reaction was performed for 20 min at 37 °C. One unit of PAP is defined as the amount of enzyme needed for incorporation of 1 pmol of AMP per min. Reaction rate was measured in a linear rangeversus PAP concentrations (8–23 nm) and time (10–30 min). Kinetic parameters were determined using oligoA15 in the concentration range 0.0125–2 μm for the full-length hsPAPγ and hsPAPII. In the case of kinetic estimations for the deletion mutants the same enzyme concentration was used, however, the primer concentration was in the 0.5–5 times Km range. Unthawed recombinant hsPAPγ and hsPAPII were stabilized by addition of 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 20% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT for the time kept on ice. Reactions were stopped by precipitation of the insoluble polyadenylated product in acid conditions (5% trichloroacetic acid-1% sodium pyrophosphate) in glass fiber filters and washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid (30Tsiapalis C.M. Dorson J.W. Bollum F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4486-4496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The U1A inhibition assay of hsPAPγ was done using the U1A di-peptide (from N termini to N termini; CAAAERDRKREKRKAAAA(K)AAAAKRKERKRDREAAAC where (K) is the branched lysine) kindly provided by Dr. S. Gunderson, or control U1A mono-peptide (CAAAERDRKREKRKAAAA, Sigma-Genosys) in the nonspecific polyadenylation assay described above but modified to conditions previously described (31Gunderson S.I.

The reaction mixture above was modified to final concentrations: 20 mm Tris/HCl, 60 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 0.1–0.2 μm oligoA15, and no peptide, 9.6 pmol of U1A di-peptide or U1A mono-peptide, respectively. The specific polyadenylation activity was carried out as described previously (29Martin G. Keller W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 33Bienroth S. Keller W.

Moore C.L. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 672-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CPSF partially purified from calf thymus (35Bienroth S. Wahle E. Suter-Crazzolara C. Keller W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and recombinant hsPAPγ were used as specified in the figure legends. The reaction mixture (25 μl) contained: 100 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 8.3 (measured at room temperature), 40 mm KCl, 0.040 mm EDTA, 9.6% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 9 units of RNasin (ribonuclease inhibitor), 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.72 mm MgCl2, 1 mmATP, 2.5% polyvinylalcohol, 20 mm creatinine phosphate, and the reaction was performed for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped in Proteinase K buffer, and the incubated RNA product was extracted and resolved in 10% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 19:1)-7 m urea. HeLa cells were grown up to 50–70% confluency on coverslips in the presence of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Coverslips were washed two times in PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS (pH 7.3) for 3 min, extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and then post-fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for 10 min. For immunofluorescence staining the following antibodies were used: Primary antibodies; 20:14, anti-PAPγ, Y12, and anti-PAPIIex22 in dilutions 1:2, 1:40, 1:10, 1:20, respectively; the respective pre-immune serum was used in the cases of polyclonal antibodies at the same dilutions. Secondary antibodies; species-specific goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to biotin (Amersham Pharmacia) or to Alexa Fluor 488 (emission at green spectrum) (Molecular Probes), species-specific goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 594 (emission at red spectrum) (Molecular Probes). Fixed cells were incubated for 30 min with blocking reagent buffer (5% Eliza blocking reagent, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at room temperature. Subsequently they were incubated for 30 min or 2 h with primary antibodies diluted in blocking reagent and washed 3 × 5 min in PBS. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 30 min or 1 h and washed 3 × 5 min in PBS. In the case where dual staining experiments were performed with monoclonal antibody 20:14 and anti-PAPγ and a biotin labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody was used, the cells were washed 4 × 5 min in PBS and incubated for 1 h with streptavidin coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). All coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and shielded. Where polyclonal serum was used, a control pre-immune serum was used to subtract the background signal. Fluorescence microscopy was performed in an Axioplan 2 imaging fluorescence microscope, using a 100× objective lens. Image analysis was done by the Axion vision.3 software. HeLa cells, grown up to 50% confluency, were transfected using plasmids pPAPγ(EGFP1–371), pPAPγ(EGFP1–506), and pPAPγ(EGFP1–736), and left to grow for 10 or 24 h. The Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) was used, and conditions were optimized for ratio of DNA:transfection reagent, as suggested by the manufacturer. Cells were fixed in 4% PFA (in PBS, pH 7.3), shielded, and analyzed in a fluorescence microscope by excitation at 495 nm and emission at the green spectrum. Monoclonal antibodies NN:2 and 20:14 raised against hsPAPII recognize three isoforms of PAP: 90, 100, and 106 kDa in sizes (16Thuresson A.-C. Åström J. Åström A. Grönvik K.-O. Virtanen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 979-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, a polyclonal antibody raised against bovine PAPII recognizes only the two larger forms (24Wittmann T. Wahle E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1350: 293-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 36Schul W. Driel R.v. Jong L.d. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 238: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A reason for this discrepancy could be that the monoclonal antibodies recognize a common epitope shared among all three isoforms of PAP, whereas the polyclonal antibody is directed against epitopes not present in the 90-kDa form. This experimental evidence suggests that the 90-kDa isoform of PAP has unique antigenic epitopes unrelated to the 100- and 106-kDa forms, implying that the 90-kDa isoform could be encoded by a separate gene. To identify potential human PAP-related genes we regularly searched using the BLAST algorithm (37Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58760) Google Scholar) high throughput (htgs) and non-redundant sequence data bases, while they were being released during the human genome sequencing project (38IHGS ConsortiumNature. 2001; 409: 860-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (17333) Google Scholar). During these searches we identified a PAP-related sequence in the human genomic clone (AC011245.6) located on chromosome 2. The same locus has recently been identified as a PAP-related gene and as a small RNA monoadenylating enzyme (14Perumal K. Sinha K. Henning D. Reddy R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21791-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 22Tupler R. Perini G. Green M.R. Nature. 2001; 409: 832-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Further data base searches revealed several overlapping expressed sequence tags. These results combined with 3′-RACE semi-nested RT-PCR allowed us to predict the sequence of an mRNA encoding a potential PAP. The novel human gene was named PAPOLG and its product hsPAPγ. The sequence information was used to molecularly clone cDNAs originating from HeLa cells by RT-PCR. A schematic drawing of the exon/intron organization of hsPAPγ and comparison to the previously reported gene hsPAPII is shown in Fig.1 A. The deduced amino acid sequence of hsPAPγ is presented in Fig. 1 B and compared with the bovine and human PAPII. Structural and functional domains/motifs are also represented. A comparison using the ClustalX algorithmic approach (39Thompson J.D. Gilson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35074) Google Scholar) showed that hsPAPγ has an overall identity of 67% at the nucleotide level and 60% identity at the amino acid level. The genes encoding hsPAPII and hsPAPγ span 62.5 and 37 kb of genomic sequences, respectively. They both contain 22 exons, and all splice sites obey the GT/AG rule (40Breathach, R., and Chambon, P. (1978) 75, 4853–4857Google Scholar). The topology and the sizes of exons 2–16 are shared between the two genes, implicating that they share a common ancestor and arose through gene duplication (41Sidow A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 715-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 42Skrabanek L. Wolfe K.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 694-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).

The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence (443 aa) encoded by Mtb cya contains a single hydrophobic domain of six transmembrane helices (152 aa) in the amino-terminal half of the protein.

Raviglione M.C. Kochi A. Bull. W. H. O. 1994; 72: 213-220PubMed Google Scholar). Pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis is not attributable to any single gene product. In other bacterial pathogens such as Bordetella pertussis andBacillus anthrax, adenylyl cyclase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP), plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis (2Masure H.R. Shattuck R.L. Storm D.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1987; 51: 60-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secreted form of adenylyl cyclase from B. pertussis (3Wolff J. Cook G.H. Goldhammer A.R. Berkowitz S.A.

A. 1982; 79: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) invades a variety of eukaryotic cells and is activated by the intracellular calmodulin of the host. This results in the unregulated conversion of ATP to a supraphysiological concentration of cAMP, which in turn has a profound effect on the metabolism and immune function of the host cell (5Khelef N. Zychlinsky A. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 4064-4071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Gueirard P. Druilhe A. Pretolani M. Guiso N. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1718-1725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in infections caused by B. pertussis andB. anthrax, adenylyl cyclase plays a critical role in the onset of the disease. To examine whether adenylyl cyclase in M. tuberculosis has any role in infection, we report in this paper the cloning of cya gene from M. tuberculosisH37Rv, heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, and characterization of adenylyl cyclase (Mtb AC,1 GenBankTMaccession no. AF017731). Subsequent sequencing of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome revealed the presence of five genes (Rv1264, Rv1318c, Rv1319c, Rv1320c, and Rv1625c) annotated as putative adenylyl cyclases (7Cole S.T.

The protein encoded by Rv1264 was only 0.5% as active as adenylyl cyclase encoded by the Mtb cya gene (Rv1625c). The gene product of Rv1320c, which is nearly identical to that of Rv1318c and Rv1319c, had no adenylyl cyclase activity. Mtb AC (the Rv1625 gene product) has a single six helical transmembrane domain in the amino terminus and a carboxyl-terminal cytosolic domain with extensive homology to the catalytic core of mammalian adenylyl cyclase (8Krupinski J.

Eight red colonies indicative of maltose fermentation, which requires cAMP production, were purified from a background of about 20,000 white colonies, and plasmids were isolated (Qiagen plasmid purification kit). The nucleotide sequence of the 5′ and 3′ ends of the inserts were determined using pBR322 primers upstream and downstream of the BamHI site. The length of the inserts was assessed by EcoRI and SalI digestion of the eight recombinant plasmids. Nucleotide sequence of all of the inserts was determined using a dye-conjugated Dideoxyterminator kit with primers designed by gene walking. Translation of the nucleotide sequence revealed an open reading frame (ORF), with no initiation codon but containing a stop codon, with high homology to the eukaryotic adenylyl cyclases. Thus we cloned only the carboxyl terminus of Mtb adenylyl cyclase by maltose fermentation. From the nucleotide sequence of the longest clone (3.4 kbp), aBamHI restriction endonuclease sequence was identified in the coding sequence of the Mtb cya gene. A 22-base oligonucleotide (5′-dCGGTAAGTTTCGTCC TCACGAC-3′) upstream to theBamHI site was synthesized, 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase, and used as a probe in Southern hybridization (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) of the chromosomal DNA completely digested with BamHI. A 2.6-kbp fragment, identified on the Southern blot, was ligated into the BamHI site of pRE1 vector, which was developed to clone lethal genes such as E. coli adenylyl cyclase (10Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). E. coli C600 λ lysogen was transformed with the ligation products, and the colonies were screened with the oligonucleotide probe; plasmids were isolated from pure positive colonies, and the nucleotide sequence of the 2.6-kbpBamHI fragment was determined. Translation of the nucleotide sequence revealed an ORF with a GTG initiation codon in-frame with the ORF of the carboxyl terminus. Because none of the clones described above had the full-length cya gene, we constructed a full-lengthcya gene under the transcriptional control of the heat-inducible λ PL promoter in the pRE1 expression vector as follows. A NdeI restriction endonuclease sequence, 5′-CATATG-3′, was introduced at the initiation codon of Mtbcya by PCR using a forward primer 5′-dATTAGGCTTTAGCATATGGCGGCAAG-3′. The reverse primer was 5′-dCGCGGATCCTTCAATTGCG-3′, encompassing the internalBamHI site (Fig. 1, base pairs 1842–1847) (bold letters represent mutations). The template DNA was the pRE1 plasmid containing the Mtb cya gene coding for the amino-terminal 335 aa of adenylyl cyclase, obtained by Southern hybridization. The amplified product was purified and digested with NdeI andBamHI restriction endonucleases; theNdeI-BamHI cya fragment was ligated into the pRE1 expression vector and transformed into C600 λ lysogen. Several recombinants were isolated from C600 λ lysogen and sequenced. All of the recombinants had unaltered nucleotide sequences. One of the recombinants was chosen for the construction of a full-lengthcya gene in the pRE1 expression vector. The BamHI fragment that codes for the carboxyl terminus of Mtb AC was purified from the 3.4-kbp insert obtained in the first step of cloning, and the fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of the pRE1-cya (335 aa) recombinant. A recombinant with the full-length Mtb cya gene containing the BamHI fragment in the correct orientation was isolated from E. coli C600 λ lysogen and introduced into E. coli MZ1 for protein expression. Mutagenesis was performed to mutate at once all of the eight arginine residues in the amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail to glycine/alanine. The pRE1-Mtb cyarecombinant plasmid was digested with NdeI andBstEII to remove the DNA fragment coding for the 57 amino-terminal amino acids. A DNA cassette was constructed withNdeI and BstEII ends as follows: four forward and five reverse oligonucleotides with overlapping sequences, designed to change all of the eight arginine residues to four glycine and four alanine residues were 5′ phosphorylated with ATP and polynucleotide kinase (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were heated to 70 °C, slowly cooled to 37 °C to facilitate annealing, and kept in ice before ligation into the pRE1-Mtb cya recombinant plasmid, deleted for the DNA fragment between NdeI and BstEII sites. The sequence of the oligonucleotides, with bold letters indicating the mutation, was as follows: Oligo 1, 5′-dTATGGCGGCAGGAAAATGCGGCGCCCCACCGATAGCAGCGGAT-3′; Oligo 2, 5′-dGGCTCGACAGCAGGACCAGACTGTGTCACGGCCGTGGCAACTCAG-3′; Oligo 3, 5′-dGCCGGTGCTCCCACGCAGCACTACGCCGAAAGCGTCGCGGCA-3′; Oligo 4, 5′-dGGACAGGCTGTGCTTACCATCACCGCCTGGCTCGCTGTCGTG-3′; Oligo 5, 5′-dGTTACCACGACAGCGAGCCAGGCGGTGAT-3′; Oligo 6, 5′-dAAGCACAGCCTGTCCTGCCGCGACGCTTTCGGCGTAGTG-3′; Oligo 7, 5′-dCTGCGTGGGAGCACCGGCCTGAGTTGCCACGGCCGT-3′; Oligo 8, 5′-dGACACAGTCTGGTCCTGCTGTCGAGCCATCCGCTGCTAT-3′; Oligo 9, 5′-dCGGTGGGGCGCCGCA- TTTTCCTGCCGCCA-3′. Mutagenesis was performed to evaluate the role of each arginine residue in the activity of adenylyl cyclase. The pRE1-Mtb cya recombinant plasmid was digested with NdeI and BstEII, the DNA fragment corresponding to the amino-terminal 57 amino acids was purified from low melting agarose gel, and ends were made blunt with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and cloned into the SmaI site of M13mp18 vector. Mutants R4G, R18A, R19G, R18A/R19G, R27A, R31G, R43A, R44G, R46A, R43A/R44G, R43K, R44K, R46K, and R43K/R44K were created by site-directed mutagenesis according to Kunkel's method (15Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides for the creation of mutants, with bold letters indicating mutation, were as follows: 5′-dTGGGGCGCCGCATTTTCCTGCCGCCATAGGG-3′ for R4G; 5′-dTCTGGGCGTGCTGTCGAGCC-3′ for R18A; 5′-dACAGTCTGGGCCTCGTGTCGAGC-3′ for R19G; 5′-dCGTGACACAGTCTGGGCCTGCTGTCGAGCCATCCGC-3′ for R18A/R19G; 5′-dAGCGCGGGCCTGAGTGGCCACGGCCGTGAC-3′ for R27A; 5′-dTGCGTGGGAGCGCCGGCCTGAGTGC-3′ for R31G; 5′-dACGCGCTGCCGCGCCGCGACGCTTTC-3′ for R43A; 5′-dACGCGCTGCCCCCGCGCGAC-3′ for R44G; 5′-dTGGTAAGCACGGCCTGCCGCCGC-3′ for R46A; 5′-dGGTGATGGTAAGCACGCGCTGCCCCGCCGCGACGCTTTCGGC-3′for R43A/R44G; 5′-dACGCGCTGCCGCTTCGCGACGCTTTC-3′ for R43K; 5′-dACGCGCTGCTTCCGCGCGAC-3′ for R44K; 5′-dTGGTAAGCACCTTCTGCCGCCGC-3′ for R46K; 5′-dGGTGATGGTAAGCACGCGCTGCTTCTTCGCGACGCTTTCGGC-3′ for R43K/R44K. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using dye-conjugated Dideoxyterminator kit. The NdeI-BstEII fragment in M13 was amplified by PCR using 5′-dGAGCTCGGTACCATATGGCGGCA-3′ (NdeI primer) and 5′-dTCTAGAGGATCCCGGTTACCACGAC-3′ (BstEII primer). The amplified fragment was purified from unreacted primers, digested with NdeI and BstEII, purified from low melting agarose, and cloned into the pRE1-Mtbcya recombinant plasmid deleted for the DNA fragment between the NdeI and BstEII sites. M. tuberculosis genes annotated as Rv1264 and Rv1320c (7Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D.

The sequences of the primers were: Rv1264–5′ end primer, 5′-dGGAATTCCATATGACAGACCACGTGCGCG-3′; Rv1264–3′ end primer, 5′-dGCTCTAGACTACGGTGACGAGCCGGCC-3′; Rv1320c–5′ end primer, 5′-dGGAATTCCATATGCCATCCGAGAAGGCC-3′; Rv1320c–3′ end primer, 5′-dGCTCTAGACT- AATCTGTCGGATGCGCC-3′. Amplification conditions for Rv1264 were as follows: melting at 98 °C for 45 s, annealing at 68 °C for 45 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 2 min. Amplification conditions for Rv1320c were: melting at 98 °C for 45 s, annealing at 60 °C for 45 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 2 min. Amplification was performed for 30 cycles in the presence of 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. Amplified products were purified from unreacted primers, digested withNdeI and XbaI, purified from low melting agarose gel, and cloned into a similarly digested pRE1 expression vector. Recombinants were isolated from E. coli C600 λ lysogen and introduced into E. coli MZ1 for protein expression. The pRE1/cyarecombinant plasmid was introduced into E. coli strain MZ1, which carries the temperature-sensitive repressorcI857ts (11Bernard H-U Helinski D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 68: 482-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), for the expression of adenylyl cyclase. Cells were grown in 150 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) at 32 °C to an A650 of 0.4. A 50-ml aliquot of this culture was saved for estimating the uninduced level of adenylyl cyclase. The remainder of the culture was diluted with an equal volume of fresh LB medium kept at 60 °C and immediately placed in a 42 °C water bath shaker for induction. A 50-ml aliquot of induced cells was withdrawn at hourly intervals for up to 4 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min and washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Cells were suspended in buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and broken by passage through a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. Cell lysates were examined for adenylyl cyclase activity (16Harwood J.P. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4656-4662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for protein expression by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three-hour induced cells from a 2 -liter culture were suspended in 30 ml of buffer A and passed twice through a French press at 10,000 p.s.i. The crude homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant from this step was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. The membrane pellet was washed with 20 ml of buffer A without resuspension and recentrifuged for 30 min. The washed pellet was homogenized in 30 ml of buffer A. All operations were carried out at 4 °C. Aliquots of membranes were kept frozen at −20 °C. Membranes were diluted in buffer A for adenylyl cyclase assays. Adenylyl cyclase was assayed (16Harwood J.P. Peterkofsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4656-4662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in an incubation mixture of 0.25 ml containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm [α-32P]ATP (20–30 cpm/pmol), 1 mm cAMP, and an ATP regenerating system containing 20 mm creatine phosphate and 50 units of creatine phosphokinase. Reactions were initiated by the addition of the enzyme source and carried out at 30 °C. At 10 and 20 min (or 5 and 10 min), 100-μl aliquots were withdrawn into 0.2 ml 1 nperchloric acid to terminate the reaction, and cAMP was purified as described (19Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence presented in Fig. 1 has been submitted to GenBankTM under accession number AF017731. The full-length Mtbcya gene was isolated in two steps. First, the gene corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 365 amino acids was cloned by complementation of the catabolic defect for maltose fermentation in thecya deletion strain, E. coli TP610, which lacks adenylyl cyclase activity. Eight red colonies, indicative of putative positives, were identified on MacConkey/Maltose plates. Cyclic AMP synthesis, measured by the in vitro adenylyl cyclase assay in extracts of E. coli TP610 harboring one or the other of the eight clones, was barely above the detection level (level of detection is 1 pmol of cAMP/min/mg of protein; data not shown) but was apparently enough to “turn on” the maltose operon in vivo. Restoration of the catabolic defect with all of these clones was dependent on the cAMP receptor protein, since a cya/crpdeletion strain transformed with these plasmids failed to ferment lactose and maltose (Table I). A GenBankTM search for the presence of a common ORF in all eight clones revealed that the ORF had extensive homology (see below) to the catalytic core of eukaryotic adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases.Table IPhenotypic properties of cya genes from M. tuberculosiscya geneE. coli AP850 (cya deletion)E. coli CA8445 (cya/crp deletion)LactoseMaltoseLactoseMaltoseRv1625c (Mtbcya) in pRE1++++−−Rv1264 in pRE1+±−−Rv1320c in pRE1−−−−Mtb cya clones 1–8 (in pBR322)+++−−pRE1 (control)−−−−A cya deletion strain AP850 (deleted for adenylyl cyclase) and a cya/crp double deletion strain CA8445 (deleted for both adenylyl cyclase and cAMP receptor protein) were transformed by electroporation with pRE1 (amp R) harboring Rv1625c, Rv1264, or Rv1320c. Simultaneously, pRK248 plasmid (tet R) that carries temperature-sensitive mutation in cI857 was introduced into the cells.

Open table in a new tab A cya deletion strain AP850 (deleted for adenylyl cyclase) and a cya/crp double deletion strain CA8445 (deleted for both adenylyl cyclase and cAMP receptor protein) were transformed by electroporation with pRE1 (amp R) harboring Rv1625c, Rv1264, or Rv1320c.

The strength of fermentation of sugars is recorded as +++ for strongly positive to ± for weakly positive. Negative fermentation is indicated by −. It is noteworthy that the orientation of all eight of the inserts was identical and the DNA sequence of all the clones had a start point within about 100 base pairs of each other, but the end points were significantly different, ranging from about 1 to 3.4 kbp. Because there is no apparent translation initiation signal corresponding to the ORF, we reasoned that these clones encode a fusion protein of the 97 amino acids of the tetracycline resistance protein at theBamHI cloning site in pBR322 and an adenylyl cyclase catalytic core capable of synthesizing cAMP. Indeed, sequence analysis at the fusion revealed that Trp97 of the tetracycline resistance protein was fused to Ile79 incya clones 1, 3, and 7; Ile89 in cyaclones 2, 6, and 8; and Ile113 in cya clones 4 and 5. The absence of the translation initiation signal corresponding to this ORF in these eight clones also led us to believe that the full-length cya gene could not be obtained either under the transcriptional control of the constitutive tet promoter in pBR322 or its own transcriptional unit in a multicopy plasmid. This observation is in accord with our previous finding that uncontrolled expression of adenylyl cyclase with concomitant overproduction of cAMP is lethal to E. coli cells, which led to the development of the pRE expression vector for controlled lethal gene expression (10Reddy P. Peterkofsky A. McKenney K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 10473-10488Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Consequently, Southern hybridization was used to obtain that portion of the cya gene coding for the amino terminus of Mtb AC in the pRE vector as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The complete coding sequence of the Mtb cya gene was assembled from the overlapping sequences of the clones obtained in pBR322 and pRE1 vectors. The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the Mtb cya are presented in Fig.1 and have been deposited in GenBankTM (accession no. AF017731). A putative open reading frame of 443 amino acids, beginning with GTG as an initiation codon at the nucleotide triplet 841–843 and terminating with the nucleotide triplet TGA at 2170–2172, was identified. From the M. tuberculosis genome sequence published later (7Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K.

Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6514) Google Scholar), the putative start codon for the Mtb cya gene was suggested to be the GTG triplet at 916–918 in the same reading frame as above. The ribosome binding sequences for both of the GTG initiators are poor matches to the consensus sequence. However, visual examination of the consensus sequence suggested that the GTG initiator at nucleotides 841–843 has a relatively better ribosome binding sequence (nucleotides 826, 829, 830, and 831, underlined in Fig. 1). Hence we have expressed adenylyl cyclase in the E. coli MZ1/pRE1 expression vector system beginning at nucleotide 841. The Mtb cya gene that we cloned earlier (GenBankTM accession no. AF017731 (1997)) and a gene with annotation Rv1625c from M. tuberculosisgenome sequence (7Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S.

A hydropathy plot (not shown) of the Mtb adenylyl cyclase protein sequence suggests that the amino-terminal domain (aa 47–199) of the enzyme contains six transmembrane helices (Fig. 2), which is consistent with the observation that the Mtb adenylyl cyclase expressed in E. coli is membrane-bound (see below). With the exception of one negatively charged amino acid in the fourth (Asp) and fifth (Glu) helices, the other helical residues are all hydrophobic. The amino-terminal cytoplasmic tail is rich in arginine residues (17%), and their importance in adenylyl cyclase activity has been elucidated (see below). The expression profile (Fig. 3) and activity (Table II) of Mtb adenylyl cyclase (Rv1625c) are presented. The uninduced cell extract had a very low level of cAMP-synthesizing activity from the chromosomally encoded adenylyl cyclase in E"

We purified the enzyme from rat kidney and sequenced two internal peptides by quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. The peptide sequences were used to search the Expressed Sequence Tag data base, which led to the identification of a rat cDNA of 1218 base pairs encoding a polypeptide of 405 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 47.5 kDa.

Furthermore, carnitine is involved in the transfer of the products of peroxisomal β-oxidation, including acetyl-CoA, to the mitochondria for oxidation to CO2 and H2O in the Krebs cycle (3Verhoeven N.M.

The trimethyllysine is generated by the hydrolysis of proteins containing lysines that are trimethylated at their ε-amino group by a protein-dependent methyltransferase usingS-adenosylmethionine as a methyl donor. In the carnitine biosynthetic pathway, trimethyllysine is first hydroxylated at the β-position by ε-trimethyllysine hydroxylase (TMLH1), after which the resulting β-hydroxytrimethyllysine is cleaved by a specific aldolase into γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde and glycine (6Kaufman R.A.

In rat and mouse, γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase is localized exclusively in the liver, whereas in humans, the enzyme is present in kidney, liver, and brain. Although most tissues are capable of converting trimethyllysine into γ-butyrobetaine, liver and kidney are the main sites of carnitine biosynthesis in all mammals, including humans (10Englard S.

After the recent identification of the cDNAs coding for γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase and γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase (16Vaz F.M. Fouchier S.W. Ofman R. Sommer M. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7390-7394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Vaz F.M. van Gool S. Ofman R. Ijlst L. Wanders R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 1999; 466: 117-124Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we focused our attention on the first enzyme of the carnitine biosynthesis, TMLH. Like γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, TMLH is a non-heme ferrous-iron dioxygenase that requires α-ketoglutarate, Fe2+, and molecular oxygen as cofactors (8Hulse J.D. Ellis S.R. Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1654-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sachan D.S. Broquist H.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Hoppel C.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this class of enzymes, the hydroxylation of the substrate is linked to the oxidative decarboxylation of α-ketoglutarate. In both humans and rat, the highest TMLH activity is found in kidney but is also present in liver, skeletal muscle, heart, and brain (13Rebouche C.J. Engel A.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 22-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Stein R. Englard S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Subcellular localization experiments using differential centrifugation indicated that the enzyme is predominantly localized in mitochondria (8Hulse J.D. Ellis S.R. Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1654-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sachan D.S. Hoppel C.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) in contrast to the other three carnitine biosynthetic enzymes, which are cytosolic. We purified the hydroxylase responsible for the conversion of trimethyllysine to hydroxytrimethyllysine from rat kidney and determined part of its amino acid sequence by (quadrupole-time-of-flight) mass spectrometry. Using this sequence information we identified the cDNAs encoding trimethyllysine hydroxylase from rat, human, and mouse. Finally, we expressed the rat and human cDNAs in COS cells to confirm that the identified cDNAs encode TMLH. Trimethyllysine was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. Q-Sepharose HP and Butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow were obtained fromAmersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden), and CHT-II hydroxylapatite was from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). All other reagents were of analytical grade. The pMAL-C2X vector was purchased from New England BioLabs (Herts, United Kingdom), the pcDNA3 vector was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Two methods were used to determine TMLH activity. In the first method, TMLH activity was determined radiochemically by measuring trimethyllysine-dependent release of [14C]CO2 that is produced from the decarboxylation of α-[1-14C]ketoglutarate to succinate. The assay mixture (total volume, 250 μl) contained 75 mm Tris/MES(HCl) buffer, pH 6.7, containing 90 μm α-ketoglutarate, 10 μmα-[1-14C]ketoglutarate, 2.5 mm sodium ascorbate, 5.0 mm calcium chloride, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm ammonium iron(II)sulfate, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 2 mm trimethyllysine. The reaction was started by adding the enzyme sample to the reaction mixture and allowed to proceed for 30 min at 37 °C, after which it was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of perchloric acid. The released [14C]O2 was trapped in 0.5 ml of 2m NaOH, essentially as described by Wanders et al. (22Wanders R.J. Denis S. Ruiter J.P. Schutgens R.B. van Roermund C.W. Jacobs B.S. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1995; 18: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and the NaOH was counted for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter. In the second method, the amount of hydroxytrimethyllysine that was enzymatically produced from trimethyllysine was determined by HPLC tandem MS. The reaction mixture and incubation time were the same as in the radiochemical method, except for the α-ketoglutarate concentration, which was 2.5 mm instead of 0.1 mm. This method will be described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the reaction mixture was applied on a Microcon centrifugal filter unit with a 30-kDa cut-off (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to remove most of the proteins. 100 μl of the filtrate was derivatized with methyl chloroformate at alkaline pH, followed by ethyl acetate extraction. Part of the aqueous phase was injected into an ion pair HPLC system using heptafluorobutyric acid as ion pairing agent, and the hydroxytrimethyllysine was quantified by tandem MS. Kidneys were taken from male Wistar rats and homogenized by five strokes of a Teflon pestle in a Potter-Elvehjem glass homogenizer at 500 rpm in a 10 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 100 g/liter glycerol, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The crude homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × gat 4 °C to remove nuclei and whole cells. The resulting supernatant was sonicated 5 times for 30 s at 10 watts and centrifuged for 1 h at 33,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, after which the sonication and centrifugation steps were repeated. The two supernatants were pooled, diluted 20-fold in a 5 mm MES buffer, pH 6.0, containing 100 g/liter glycerol and 5 mmDTT and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The resulting protein precipitate was pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 ×g at 4 °C and dissolved in a 20 mmethanolamine buffer, pH 9.3, containing 100 g/liter glycerol, 25 mm KCl, and 5 mm DTT. After centrifugation for 20 min at 20,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was applied to a Q-Sepharose HP column (diameter = 2.6 cm; h = 10 cm; flow: 3 ml/min), which was pre-equilibrated with a 20 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.3, containing 100 g/liter glycerol and 2.5 mm DTT. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 25 to 400 mm KCl in the same buffer. Fractions containing high TMLH activity were pooled and diluted 1:4 in a 20 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.3, containing 100 g/liter glycerol, 200 mm ammonium sulfate, 2 mm sodium ascorbate, 1 m KCl, and 5 mm DTT. The solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 4,000 × g at 4 °C to remove protein precipitates, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow column (diameter = 1.6 cm; h = 11 cm; flow: 2.5 ml/min), pre-equilibrated with the dilution-buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 1 m KCl + 200 mm ammonium sulfate to 0 m of both salts in a 20 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.3, containing 100 g/liter glycerol, 2 mm sodium ascorbate, and 5 mm DTT. Fractions containing high TMLH activity were pooled and diluted 1:1 in a 20 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.2, containing 100 g/liter glycerol, 2 mm sodium ascorbate, and 5 mm DTT and loaded onto an Econo-Pac CHT-II hydroxylapatite column (diameter = 2 cm; h = 5 cm; flow: 1 ml/min) equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 50 mm potassium phosphate. Fractions were tested for TMLH activity and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by silver staining. SDS-PAGE and silver staining were performed as described by Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) and Rabilloud et al. (24Rabilloud T. Carpentier G. Tarroux P. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), respectively. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. The Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) of purified TMLH for trimethyllysine, α-ketoglutarate, and Fe2+ were determined using the radiometric assay described above. For the determination of theKm of α-ketoglutarate and Fe2+, a fixed concentration of 2 mm trimethyllysine was used. The pH optimum was determined by using 75 mm bis-tris-propane buffer instead of the Tris/MES buffer, at pH values ranging from 5.5 to 9.5 in steps of 1 pH unit. For MALDI-TOF MS analysis, protein-containing gel slices were S-alkylated, digested with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, sequencing grade), and extracted according to Shevchenko et al. (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7822) Google Scholar). Extracted peptides were purified and concentrated using Zip-Tips (Millipore). Peptides were eluted from the Zip-Tips with 10 μl of 1% (v/v) formic acid, 60% acetonitrile. The peptide solution was mixed with an equal volume of 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma Chemical Co.) solution in acetonitrile/ethanol (1:1, v/v). Aliquots of 0.5 μl were spotted on the target and allowed to dry at room temperature. MALDI-TOF MS spectra were acquired on a Micromass TofSpec 2EC (Micromass, Wythenshawe, UK) equipped with a 2-GHz digitizer. The resulting peptide spectra were used to search a non-redundant protein sequence data base (Swiss-Prot/TREMBL) using the Proteinprobe program. For ESI-Q-TOF MS the peptide solution (2 μl) was introduced into a nanospray capillary, and positive mode spectra were recorded with a Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with a Z-spray source. The complete open reading frame (ORF) of rat TMLH was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from rat kidney cDNA usingPwo DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and the following primers: a BamHI-tagged forward primer 5′-aaaggatcc ATGAAGAGAGGAGACATAGCTCAC-3′ and aNotI-tagged reverse primer 5′-ttttgcggccgc TTAGGCATGAAGACCTAGAATTC-3′. The human ORF of TMLH was amplified from human kidney cDNA using the following primers: a BamHI-tagged forward primer 5′-tataggatcc ATGTGGTACCACAGATTGTC-3′ and anNotI-tagged reverse primer 5′-tatagcggccgcCTGTTAAGCCTGAAGCCCCAAGA-3′. The PCR products were cloned downstream of the PCMV promoter into the BamHI and NotI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3. Both ORFs were sequenced to exclude sequence errors introduced by Pwo DNA polymerase during the PCR, after which the constructs were transfected to COS cells using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD) as described by the manufacturer. 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested by trypsinization and lysed in a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 200 g/liter glycerol, and 1 mm DTT by sonicating two times for 15 s at 8 watts. TMLH activity was determined by the HPLC tandem MS method described above. The rat and human TMLH ORFs were amplified as described above using the same primers. For the amplification of the rat ORF starting from the second methionine, the following BamHI-tagged forward primer was used: 5′-ttttggatcc ATGCGCTTTGATTATGTCTGGC-3′ in combination with the same reverse primer described above. The PCR products were cloned downstream of the galactose-inducibleGAL1 promoter into the BamHI and NotI sites of the yeast expression vector pYES2. To assess the fidelity of the PCR process the ORFs were sequenced. The constructs were transformed to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain INVSC2 using the lithium acetate procedure (27Becker D.M. Guarente L. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 182-187Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were grown on minimal glucose medium (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 3 g/liter glucose) to fully repress transcription of theGAL1 promoter. Cells were transferred to minimal lactate medium (6.7 g/liter yeast nitrogen base, 20 g/liter lactate) and galactose was added to a final concentration of 4 g/liter to induce protein expression. After overnight induction, spheroplasts were prepared using zymolyase (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA) according to Franzusoff et al. (28Franzusoff A. Rothblatt J. Schekman R. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic press, San Diego, CA1991: 662-674Google Scholar) and lysed in a 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 200 g/liter glycerol, and 1 mm DTT. The complete ORF of TMLH was amplified by PCR from human kidney cDNA using PwoDNA polymerase and the following primers: a BamHI-tagged forward primer 5′-tataggatcc ATGTGGTACCACAGATTGTC-3′ and aPstI-tagged reverse primer 5′-tatagacgtcCTGTTAAGCCTGAAGCCCCAAGA-3′. The PCR product was cloned downstream of the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible PTAC promoter into the BamHI and PstI sites of the bacterial expression vector pMAL-C2X, to express the TMLH as a fusion protein with maltose-binding protein. The ORF was sequenced to exclude sequence errors introduced by PCR after which the construct was transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21. Transformed cells were grown in LB-medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an A600 of 0.7 and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm to induce fusion protein expression. After 2 h, cells were pelleted and lysed in 1/10 of the culture volume in a 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl by sonicating two times for 15 s at 8 watts. The bacterial lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, and the pellet was discarded. Fusion proteins were purified from the supernatant following the specifications of the manufacturer (New England BioLabs) and stored at −20 °C. This fusion protein was used to raise an antiserum in a rabbit as described earlier (29Jansen G.A. Hogenhout E.M. Ferdinandusse S. Waterham H.R. Ofman R. Jakobs C. Skjeldal O.H. Wanders R.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1195-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Kidneys were obtained from male Wistar rats and homogenized in 5 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.4, containing 250 mm sucrose and 2 mm EDTA. A postnuclear supernatant was produced by centrifugation of the homogenate at 600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and subfractionated by equilibrium density gradient centrifugation in a linear Nycodenz gradient as described previous (30Wanders R.J. van Roermund C.W. Schor D.S. ten Brink H.J. Jakobs C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1227: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Glutamate dehydrogenase, catalase, β-hexosaminidase, phosphogluco isomerase, were used as markers for mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and cytosol, respectively. The activity of the marker enzymes was determined as described previously (31Wanders R.J. Kos M. Roest B. Meijer A.J. Schrakamp G. Heymans H.S. Tegelaers W.H. van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B.

A Multiphor II Nova Blot electrophoretic transfer unit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to transfer proteins onto a Nitrocellulose sheet (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) as described by the manufacturer. After blocking of nonspecific binding sites with 50 g/liter Protifar and 10 g/liter bovine serum albumin in 1 g/liter Tween-20/phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h, the blot was incubated for 2 h with a 1:200 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against human recombinant TMLH fused to maltose-binding protein (purified as described above) in the same buffer without Protifar. Goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase were used for detection, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). For gel filtration analysis a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used. A 20 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.3, containing 100 g/liter glycerol, 2 mm sodium ascorbate, and 5 mm DTT was used as eluant at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. All analyses were performed at 4 °C. The column was calibrated under identical conditions with the following protein standards: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (14 kDa), all from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The 10log of the molecular mass of the protein standards was plotted against the corresponding elution fractions, and the molecular mass of TMLH was calculated by interpolation. Blue native PAGE was performed as described previously using a 6–14% polyacrylamide gradient gel (33Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar, 34Klement P. Nijtmans L.G. Van den Bogert C. Houstek J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 231: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Citrate synthase (87 kDa) from pig heart (Sigma) and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) were used as protein standards. Because kidney contains the highest TMLH activity in the rat (35Stein R. Englard S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 116: 230-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), this tissue was used as source of enzyme for the purification of TMLH using liquid chromatography. An overview of the purification scheme is given in Table I. TMLH activity was retained completely by all columns used and eluted as a single peak during all purification steps. The presence of ascorbate was essential for preserving the enzymatic activity during the later purification steps and subsequent storage at −80 °C. Samples obtained after each purification step were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 1). A single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa was observed after the last purification step.Table IOverview of the various steps involved in the purification of TMLH from rat kidneyPurification stepProteinSpecific activityActivityYieldPurificationmgnmol/min.mgnmol/min%-foldHomogenate62890.022139100Low salt precipitate6130.17105767.8Q-Sepharose211.34282061Butyl-Sepharose0.810.386467CHT-II hydroxylapatite0.1258.6752658 Open table in a new tab Attempts to directly sequence the protein by Edman degradation failed, suggesting that the N terminus of TMLH is blocked. Therefore, the purified protein was digested with trypsin and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. Because no match was found in the non-redundant data base (Swiss-Prot/TREMBL), two peptides were selected for sequencing by Q-TOF MS, which resulted in the following sequences: TLLVDGFYAAQQVLQR (1821.99 Da) and MWYFTSDFRS (1339.58 Da). When the non-redundant data base was searched with these peptides sequences, both showed high homology with the human hypothetical protein FLJ10727 (GenBank™ accession number: NP_060666). Subsequent searches in the EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) data base identified several rat, mouse, and human EST clones with high homology to the peptide sequences. The homologous human ESTs all corresponded to the FLJ10727 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number: AK001589). Interestingly, the translated FLJ10727 cDNA showed high homology with human, rat, and Pseudomonas sp. AK-1 γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase. Based on the EST data, primers were selected to amplify the ORFs from rat, human, and mouse kidney cDNA. The rat and mouse amplicons both contained an ORF of 1218 base pairs, coding for a polypeptide of 405 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 47.5 kDa (GenBank™ accession numbers: AF374406 and AY033513, respectively). When the theoretical trypsin digest of the translated rat ORF was compared with the MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of the purified TMLH, 12 of the 27 theoretical peptides could be matched, which corresponds with a protein coverage of 34%. The human amplicon contained an ORF of 1266 base pairs, coding for a polypeptide of 421 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 49.5 kDa (GenBank™ accession number: AF373407). The human TMLH cDNA sequence was identical to the FLJ10727 cDNA. This sequence is derived from genomic clone NT025307, which has been mapped to Xq28. BLASTn analysis of the human genome data base using the human TMLH cDNA as query showed that the TMLH gene spans about 130 kb and consists of at least eight exons. The translated ORFs of rat and mouse both have 88% positional identity with the human TMLH protein. The rat and mouse proteins are also highly homologous and share 92% positional identity. When the putative rat and human TMLH cDNAs were expressed in either E. coli (as maltose-binding fusion protein) or S. cerevisiae, no TMLH activity could be detected in lysates of these cells. Therefore, both ORFs were cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3 and transiently transfected to COS cells. As a negative control, the pcDNA3 vector without insert was included in the transfection experiment. After 48 h, TMLH activity was measured in the lysates of the transfected cells employing the TMLH assay, which is based on the measurement of hydroxytrimethyllysine by HPLC tandem MS. Incubations were performed both in the presence and absence of substrate to show that the formation of hydroxytrimethyllysine was trimethyllysine-dependent. High TMLH activity could be measured in lysates of COS cells transfected with the putative rat and human TMLH cDNA, whereas only low (endogenous) TMLH activity was measured in lysates of cells transfected with the pcDNA3 vector without insert (Fig.2 A). Subsequent immunoblot analysis using the TMLH antibody showed a band with the same molecular mass as the purified TMLH in cells transfected with the rat and human ORF, which was hardly detectable in lysates of cells transfected with pcDNA3 without insert. Additionally, the amount of immunoreactive material was proportional to the TMLH activity (Fig. 2 B). To investigate the subcellular localization of TMLH, a density gradient analysis was performed with rat kidney homogenate. All the TMLH activity was associated with the particulate fraction, which was loaded on a Nycodenz density gradient. The activity profile in the gradient exactly coincided with that of the mitochondrial marker glutamate dehydrogenase, confirming the mitochondrial localization of TMLH (Fig.3). When we analyzed the gradient-fractions by immunoblot analysis using antibodies raised against recombinant TMLH, the pattern of the immunoreactive material corresponded exactly with the TMLH activity profile (Fig. 3). With a calculated molecular mass of 47.5 kDa, the size of the translated ORF of rat TMLH is not in agreement with that of the purified protein, which has an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa. Additionally, the COS cell transfection experiment showed that the produced human and rat TMLH both have the same apparent molecular mass as the purified rat TMLH, although the calculated molecular masses are 47.5 and 49 kDa, respectively. The 5′-end of the rat cDNA, as well as the mouse and human cDNAs, contained a second putative start codon. The use of this methionine would result in a protein of 42 kDa, and we therefore expressed the shorter rat protein in S. cerevisiae to investigate whether translation starts at this methionine. Immunoblot analysis of the yeast lysate with the TMLH antibody, however, clearly showed that the size of the expressed protein is smaller than the purified rat TMLH, indicating that this methionine is not used as start codon (Fig.4). Another possibility is that TMLH is synthesized as a 47.5-kDa precursor, which is processed after import into the mitochondrion. The protein sequences of rat, mouse, and human TMLH indeed contain a putative N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence as determined by the Predotar version 0.5 prediction program. 2Available at www.inra.fr/Internet/Produits/Predotar. Immunoblot experiments support this hypothesis, because expression of the full-length rat TMLH in S. cerevisiae resulted in a protein of 47.5 kDa (the predicted molecular mass of the translated rat ORF), but also showed a band with the same molecular mass as the purified rat protein (Fig. 4). Together, these results suggest that a 47.5-kDa precursor protein is synthesized and subsequently processed between the first and second methionine, resulting in a mature protein of ∼43 kDa. The enzyme has a broad pH optimum between 6.5 and 7.5 at 37 °C, which is in agreement with previous results (20Stein R. Englard S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Km values of trimethyllysine, α-ketoglutarate, and Fe2+ were determined for the highly purified enzyme from Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots and were 1.1 mm, 109 μm, and 54 μm, respectively (Fig. 5). TheKm value of trimethyllysine is in agreement with the results of Sachan et al. (21Sachan D.S. Hoppel C.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), who determined aKm value of 1.6 mm for the partially purified rat liver enzyme. Two other groups have determinedKm values of 0.1 mm (20Stein R. Englard S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and 0.13 mm (36Henderson L.M. Nelson P.J. Henderson L. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 2843-2847PubMed Google Scholar) for the rat and bovine liver enzymes, respectively, which are considerably lower than the Km value determined in this study. The Km values found previously for α-ketoglutarate (480 and 220 μm) and Fe2+ (21 and 60 μm) are in agreement with our results (20Stein R. Englard S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 324-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 36Henderson L.M. Nelson P.J. Henderson L. Fed. Proc. 1982; 41: 2843-2847PubMed Google Scholar). Gel filtration analysis showed that the native enzyme has a molecular mass of ∼87 kDa, suggesting that TMLH has a dimeric configuration (Fig.6 A). This result was supported by blue native PAGE analysis (Fig. 6 B), which showed that TMLH has a similar size as citrate synthase (87 kDa). MALDI-TOF analysis demonstrated that the protein band of ∼87 kDa only contained TMLH, suggesting that TMLH is a homodimer. To identify the genes encoding the enzymes of the carnitine biosynthetic pathway we previously purified rat liver γ-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase and γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, the penultimate and ultimate enzymes in carnitine biosynthesis, respectively. We used protein sequence data in combination with EST data base searching to identify the corresponding rat and human cDNAs (16Vaz F.M. Fouchier S.W. Ofman R. Sommer M. Wanders R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7390-7394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 17Vaz F.M. van Gool S. Ofman R. Ijlst L. Wanders R.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 506-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study the same approach was used to identify TMLH, which mediates the first step in carnitine biosynthesis. The enzyme was purified from rat kidney to near homogeneity and used for peptide sequencing. Subsequently, the resulting peptide sequences were used to search the EST data base, and ORFs were identified from rat, mouse, and human origin with high homology to the peptide sequences. The following observations demonstrated that the identified rat cDNA truly encodes TMLH. First, the peptide sequences obtained from the purified kidney TMLH exactly matched two stretches of sequence from the translated coding region of the rat cDNA. Second, the heterologously expressed rat cDNA exhibited high TMLH activity. Third, the peptide pattern of the purified rat TMLH determined by MALDI-TOF analysis matched the theoretical trypsin digest of the translated rat ORF. Finally, the antibody raised against recombinant TMLH recognized the purified enzyme. Because the human homologue of the rat TMLH has 88% positional identity with the rat protein and exhibited high TMLH activity in the heterologous expression system, the corresponding cDNA encodes human TMLH. Data base searching showed that the TMLH cDNA is identical to the FLJ10727 cDNA and that the TMLH gene is localized at Xq28. Although we did not express the mouse ORF, it has 92% positional identity with the rat TMLH, and therefore most likely represents the mouse homologue of TMLH. Purified TMLH behaves as an 87-kDa enzyme in both gel filtration and blue native PAGE analysis. Because a single protein of 43 kDa was present in the final purification sample and the MALDI-TOF analysis of the blue native PAGE sample demonstrated that the dimer consisted of a single protein, TMLH appears to be homodimer. The last enzyme of carnitine biosynthesis, γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase, has considerable homology with TMLH and has also been reported to function as a homodimer (37Kondo A. Blanchard J.S. Englard S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 212: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 38Lindstedt G. Lindstedt S. Nordin I.

Analysis of the non-redundant data base with the BLASTp algorithm using rat TMLH as query, only retrieved γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase sequences from several organisms. No homology was found with other α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, suggesting that TMLH and γ-butyrobetaine hydroxylase belong to a separate subclass of dioxygenases. TMLH has been reported to be localized in mitochondria (8Hulse J.D. Ellis S.R. Henderson L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1654-1659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Sachan D.S. Hoppel C.L. Biochem. J. 1980; 188: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), although this conclusion was drawn from relatively crude experiments involving differential centrifugation. Therefore, the subcellular localization of TMLH in rat kidney was re-investigated by subcellular fractionation using density gradient analysis. The TMLH activity profile and the distribution of immunoreactive material clearly showed that TMLH is localized exclusively in mitochondria. The expression studies of TMLH in S. cerevisiae suggest that translation of TMLH starts at the first available start codon, which results in the formation of a 47.5-kDa precursor protein. This precursor is subsequently processed to the mature 43-kDa protein, presumably upon import into mitochondria where the mitochondrial import machinery removes the N-terminal presequence. The mitochondrial localization of TMLH is remarkable, because the other three enzymes of the carnitine biosynthesis are localized in the cytosol. The submitochondrial localization of TMLH will have implications for the substrate flow and regulation of the carnitine biosynthesis. If TMLH is localized in the mitochondrial matrix, the existence of transport system to shuttle substrate and product over the inner mitochondrial membrane would be required. In contrast, if TMLH is present in either the inner membrane space or the outer mitochondrial membrane, no transport system would be needed because the outer mitochondrial membrane is permeable for small molecules. We gratefully acknowledge S. van Woerkom for providing the rat kidneys, D. Speijer for the MALDI-TOF analysis, and H. R. Waterham for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2034069573,"The flocculus of the rabbit is involved in the plasticity of compensatory eye movements. It is generally assumed that the climbing fiber input to floccular Purkinje cells encodes ""retinal slip,"" which in turn would be a measure for the oculomotor performance error. To test this, we used transparent motion stimuli, creating a retinal slip signal that broke up this relation. We recorded the ensuing oculomotor behavior and complex spike activity of floccular Purkinje cells. Complex spike modulation in response to transparent stimulation was identical to that of a single optokinetic pattern, despite considerably different retinal slip. These results suggest that the climbing fiber code may be effectively related to the eye movement performance error, rather than to retinal slip."

https://openalex.org/W2056909189,"Transcription of genes coding for metazoan spliceosomal snRNAs by RNA polymerase II (U1, U2, U4, U5) or RNA polymerase III (U6) is dependent upon a unique, positionally conserved regulatory element referred to as the proximal sequence element (PSE). Previous studies in the organism Drosophila melanogaster indicated that as few as three nucleotide differences in the sequences of the U1 and U6 PSEs can play a decisive role in recruiting the different RNA polymerases to transcribe the U1 and U6 snRNA genes in vitro. Those studies utilized constructs that contained only the minimal promoter elements of the U1 and U6 genes in an artificial context. To overcome the limitations of those earlier studies, we have now performed experiments that demonstrate that the Drosophila U1 and U6 PSEs have functionally distinct properties even in the environment of the natural U1 and U6 gene 5'-flanking DNAs. Moreover, assays in cells and in transgenic flies indicate that expression of genes from promoters that contain the incorrect PSE is suppressed in vivo. The Drosophila U6 PSE is incapable of recruiting RNA polymerase II to initiate transcription from the U1 promoter region, and the U1 PSE is unable to recruit RNA polymerase III to transcribe the U6 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1992891783,"Mice deficient for the mismatch repair (MMR) gene Msh2 show accelerated tumourigenesis and a reduced apoptotic response to DNA damage of methylation type. Here we examine the effect of mutation for Msh2 on in vivo mutation frequencies in the intestine as determined by loss of function at the Dolichos biflorus (Dlb-1) locus. Spontaneous mutation frequencies were scored in cohorts of ageing mice either wild type or mutant for Msh2. In mice less than 1 year old, mutation frequencies were only elevated in Msh2 null mice. However, beyond this age heterozygous Msh2 mice showed significantly higher mutation frequencies than controls. These findings implicate a gene dose dependent requirement for Msh2 in mutation suppression and prompted an analysis of young Msh2 mutants following exposure to DNA damage. Following exposure to N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), Msh2 deficient mice show a reduced apoptotic response and an increase in mutation frequency. Heterozygotes did not differ from controls. Following exposure to cisplatin, no significant elevation was seen in mutation frequencies, even within homozygotes. This is particularly surprising given the association between cisplatin resistance and MMR deficiency. These findings therefore demonstrate a complex reliance upon functional Msh2 in mutation surveillance. We have identified three separate scenarios. First, where retention of both Msh2 alleles over an extended period of time appears critical to the suppression of spontaneous mutation; second, 3 weeks following exposure to MNNG, where only complete loss of Msh2 results in elevated mutation; and finally following cisplatin exposure, where induced levels of mutation are independent of Msh2 status."

Regulation by AP-1 has been demonstrated in diverse cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, tissue remodeling, and apoptosis (Ref. 3Wisdom R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar and references therein). Altered expression and DNA binding of AP-1 subunits, and inappropriate transactivation of AP-1-dependent effector genes, are events implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers and in cardiovascular, neurological, and other disease states (4Denhardt D.T. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1996; 7: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 5Chakraborti S. Chakraborti T. Cell.

AP-1 activation is a pivotal event in mediating cancer susceptibility and neoplastic transformation in response to endogenous and extracellular stimuli, including hormones, growth factors, tumor promoters, and many other carcinogenic agents (Refs. 7Bernstein L.R. Colburn N.H. Science. 1989; 244: 566-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 8Dong Z. Birrer M.J. Watts R.G. Matrisian L.M. Colburn N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many genes associated with neoplastic transformation harbor AP-1 sites, including genes encoding matrix-degrading enzymes, differentiation factors, and mitogenic agents. AP-1 is a dimer composed of proto-oncogene products encoded by thejun and fos families. The jun family consists of c-jun, junB, and junD, and the fos family consists of c-fos,fra-1, fra-2, and fosB. Dimers can be Jun family-Jun family homodimers or Jun family-Fos family heterodimers, generating 18 possible complexes via leucine zipper dimerization motifs within the Jun and Fos subunits. AP-1 dimers bind DNA via a basic region immediately adjoining the leucine zipper, forming a composite region in the proteins referred to as the “bZIP” motif (see Ref. 10Hurst H.C. Protein Profile, Transcription Factors 1: bZIP Proteins. 2. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 105-176Google Scholarfor review). Gene expression is regulated by transactivation domains within the AP-1 subunits, which modulate the efficiency of RNA polymerase II transcriptional initiation. The transactivation and DNA binding activities of AP-1 are modulated by protein kinase cascades that terminate in phosphorylation of Jun and Fos family proteins. Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily (“MAP kinases”) are thought to be responsible for phosphorylation of AP-1 proteins in vivo (see Ref. 11Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2239) Google Scholar for review). Ligand-activated receptors indirectly stimulate kinase activity of MAP kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) that activate MAP kinase kinases (MAPKKs), which in turn activate MAPKs to phosphorylate their targets, often transcription factors such as Jun and Fos (see Refs. 12L'Allemain G.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar for review). The MAP kinase superfamily is composed of several subfamilies. Each subfamily consists of a discrete signaling module with distinct MAPKKK and MAPKK components. The most well characterized members of the ERK subfamily are ERK-1 and ERK-2 and, to a lesser degree, p63/ERK-3 and human p97/ERK3 (14Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C. Moomaw C.

ERKs are primarily activated by mitogenic agonists such as TPA, epidermal growth factor, or fibroblast growth factor, whereas JNK/SAPKs are primarily activated by stress factors such as UV light, tumor necrosis factor, osmotic and heat shock, and inflammatory agents (13English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). p38 MAPKs are activated by endotoxic lipopolysaccharide and, like JNK/SAPKs, by environmental stress, osmotic shock, and inflammatory agents (13English J.

A system of several parallel MAPK signal transduction pathways has thus emerged. MAPKs regulate a number of transcription factors, including Elk/TCF, NFAT, ATF, and AP-1. ERKs and JNK/SAPKs mediate activity of AP-1 in response to mitogenic and stress factors, respectively. ERKs phosphorylate c-Jun, JunD, Fra-1, Fra-2, and FosB, and JNKs phosphorylate c-Jun and JunD (22Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Dent T. Karin M. Davis R.J.

The diverse array of regulatory molecules that interact with Jun-Fos complexes underscores the exquisite circuitry dedicated to controlling AP-1 in its pivotal position as a regulator of essential cellular functions. Previously we identified several ERK-related proteins (ERPs), including the ERK2 MAP kinase, that bind in vivo to AP-1 complexes containing c-Jun and c-Fos (39Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have found that five Jun and Fos family members form complexes with seven distinct ERK2-related ERPs, and these ERP·AP-1 complexes have associated kinase activity. To account for the multiplicity and stability of these complexes, we hypothesized that in addition to a simple enzyme-substrate relation, ERP·AP-1 complexes could interact with genes containing transcription regulatory AP-1 DNA recognition sequences. If this is the case, we should be able detect multicomponent ERP·AP-1·DNA complexes. To test this hypothesis, we devised a simple DNA affinity chromatography-based analytical assay, the “NAPSTER” assay, for specific association with DNA sequences. By these means we identified p41 and p44, two additional ERPs related to ERK2 that associate with the AP-1 DNA along with AP-1 proteins. In contrast, the first seven ERPs bind AP-1 proteins only when they are not bound to the DNA. We also identified p97, a 10th ERP related to ERK3, that associates with AP-1 DNA without AP-1 proteins. We therefore describe three distinct classes of ERPs as follows: seven class I ERPs that bind AP-1 dimers without DNA, two class II ERPs that associate along with AP-1 with DNA, and one class III ERP that associates with AP-1 DNA without AP-1 dimers.

Acta. 1999; 1489: 263-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Human HT29 adenocarcinoma cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). For routine passage, HT29 cells were plated at 1:20 in T25 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech Cellgro, Herndon, VA) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Summit Biotechnology, Inc., Fort Collins, CO) and passaged every week with media changes after 4 days. JB6 Cl307b cells were grown and passaged as described (44Watts R.G. Ben-Ari E.T. Bernstein L.R. Birrer M.J. Winterstein D. Wendel E. Colburn N.H. Mol. Carcinog. 1995; 13: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). HT29 cells for nuclear extracts (“NE”) were plated in 150-mm tissue culture dishes (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) at a density of 6 × 106 cells per dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS and allowed to grow for 5 days with one media change 4 days after plating. Cells were routinely treated for 90 min with 10 ng/ml 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; Sigma) in fresh media containing 10% FBS, unless otherwise noted. Cells were then harvested, and NE was prepared as described (43Bernstein L.R. Walker S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 263-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Biotinylated AP-1 oligonucleotide (“oligo”) derived from nucleotides from the gibbon ape leukemia virus-long terminal repeat (GALV-LTR), contained a wild type AP-1 sequence (5′-agccagagaaatagatgagtcaacagc-3′). In this paper we refer to this sequence as the AP-1 DNA-binding site or AP-1 DNA. This sequence and the inverse complementary oligo were custom-synthesized by Macromolecular Resources (Fort Collins, CO). Binding of annealed, double-stranded biotinylated oligo to streptavidin beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN) was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. AP-1 DNA affinity chromatography was performed as described by Lee et al. (1Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) with major modifications designed to achieve rapid analytical scale isolation of labile and multicomponent protein-DNA complexes. For small scale experiments, as little as 30 µg of input NE protein and 6 µg of DNA on beads were used (1:5 ratio of DNA:input protein). For large scale experiments, 3–5 mg of NE protein and 150–250 µg of DNA on beads were used (1:20 ratio of DNA:input protein). Whole nuclear extracts (NE) were dialyzed into Buffer Z (0.1 m KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, v/v, 0.1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.1 µm ZnCl2, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). AP-1 and associated proteins were then isolated by single-step batchwise AP-1 DNA affinity chromatography to promote maximal stability and detection of associated proteins. Dialyzed NE was incubated for 75 min at 4 °C on a rotating clip wheel in the presence of 6 µg/ml poly(dI/dC) with AP-1 affinity beads. Beads were centrifuged for 1 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. For small scale assays, beads were washed three times with Buffer Z; bound material was eluted by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer, and the boiled material was directly loaded in SDS-PAGE. For larger scale assays, beads were washed five times in Buffer Z and then AP-1 and associated proteins eluted in Buffer Z containing 1 m KCl by twirling on a rotating clip wheel for 30 min at 4 °C. To assess specificity of binding to the AP-1 DNA sequence, we developed an assay that we termed thenucleotide affinity preincubationspecificity test recognition assay (the NAPSTER assay). The NAPSTER assay consists of a matched set of three samples. For sample I, whole NE is directly chromatographed batchwise with AP-1 DNA beads. For sample II, NE is preincubated for 15 min at 4 °C with a 2.5-fold molar excess of wild type AP-1 DNA oligo (relative to moles of DNA on the beads) before batchwise DNA affinity chromatography. For sample III, NE is preincubated for 15 min at 4 °C with a 2.5-fold molar excess of mutant oligo (5′-agccagagaaatagaggagtctacagc-3′; mutant AP-1 core sequence GGAGTCT, mutations underlined), before chromatography. After chromatography, beads are washed and directly loaded in SDS-PAGE or subjected to elution procedures as described above. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described (39Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bernstein L.R. Walker S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 263-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Peptide competition assays for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitations were performed using a 25-fold molar excess of peptide as described (39Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Bernstein L.R. Walker S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 263-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A full-length recombinant human p97/ERK3 cDNA sequence (“rhERK3”) was cloned into the pET3C vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Thirty cycles of polymerase chain reaction were performed to amplify a linearBamHI-EcoRI rhERK3 DNA fragment containing the full-length ERK3 gene from plasmid pGEX2T-ERK3, using forward primer 5′-agggtttccatatggcagagaaatttg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-tttgtgtgcatatgacatgccagttaa-3′. This method enabled in-frame insertion of the gene into the NdeI site of the vector. Recombinant hERK3 was expressed in BL21 Codon Plus bacteria (Stratagene, Inc., La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glutathione S-transferase-JunD (GST-JunD; see Ref. 45Powers C. Krutzsch H. Gardner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30089-30095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a mouse JunD fusion construct, was expressed in DH5α bacteria. Expressed JunD was purified from bacterial extracts by GST affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and eluted with 15 mm glutathione (Sigma). pGCTD, a GST fusion construct containing the mouse gene encoding the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, (“CTD”; see Ref. 46Peterson S.R. Dvir A. Anderson C.W. Dynan W.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 426-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was expressed, and GST-CTD fusion protein was purified on the GST affinity column. V8 protease digest analyses were performed on p97 protein isolated by batchwise DNA affinity chromatography from 20 mg of nuclear extract protein. Proteins isolated on affinity beads were eluted in 1m KCl and precipitated in 10% w/v trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. Precipitated protein was run in denaturing and reducing SDS-PAGE, and the p97 band was excised from the gel. Recombinant human ERK3 was also run in SDS-PAGE and similarly excised for V8 analyses. Excised p97 and recombinant human ERK3 bands were subjected to V8 protease digestion with 0.04 units of endoproteinase Glu-C (V8 protease; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per lane, according to procedures described previously (39Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples either underwent two rounds (“double depletion”) or three rounds (“triple depletion”) of immunodepletion. For double depletions, ∼3.2 mg of NE per sample was dialyzed against Buffer Z and incubated for 90 min with an antibody mix consisting of 20 µg of αc-Jun, 20 µg of αJunD (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 10 µl of αJunD (KG), all of which had been dialyzed against Buffer Z for 45 min at 4 °C. Samples were then incubated with 25 µl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C with constant mixing. The procedure was repeated a second time to obtain double depleted samples. For triple depletions, ∼5.1 mg of dialyzed NE was preincubated for 90 min at 4 °C with an antibody mix consisting of 20 µg of αc-Jun, 20 µg of αJunB, 20 µg of αJunD, 10 µl of αJunD (KG), 20 µg of αc-Fos, 20 µg of αFosB, 20 µg of αFra-1, and 20 µg of αFra-2, followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. This procedure was repeated twice to obtain triple depleted samples. Control samples did not contain antibody mix but underwent depletion with protein A-Sepharose alone. Samples were then preadsorbed to reduce nonspecific binding by batchwise DNA affinity chromatography with beads containing streptavidin-linked mutant AP-1 oligo. Immunodepleted samples were subjected to the NAPSTER assay. For two-dimensional gels and immunodepletion assays, immunoprecipitations were performed as described (see above and Ref. 39Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For kinase assays and Western blots, Dynal protein A magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were preadsorbed for 30 min at room temperature with 5 µg of antibody in 0.1m Phosphate Buffer, pH 8.2. Samples were incubated for 1 h with 400–500 µg of dialyzed NE at 4 °C with constant twirling and then washed 3 times with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein kinase assays were performed on immunoprecipitated and DNA affinity-purified proteins using a MAP kinase assay kit with the classic MAP kinase substrate myelin basic protein (MBP; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) with minor modifications of the manufacturer's protocol. Kinase assays of immunoprecipitated proteins bound to Dynal beads were performed directly after washing steps, without elution. For kinase assays of DNA-binding proteins, nuclear extracts were dialyzed, subjected to batchwise AP-1 DNA affinity chromatography with mutant AP-1 beads to eliminate nonspecifically associated material, and then subjected to batchwise DNA affinity chromatography with beads harboring a wild type AP-1 DNA sequence. Prior to assay, proteins bound to AP-1 DNA affinity beads were eluted with a 2.5-fold molar excess of wild type AP-1 oligo to maximize the specificity and the signal to noise ratio of the assay. Elution was performed in 30 µl of Kinase Assay Buffer (20 mm MOPS pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma), 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 40 µg wt oligo at 4 °C for 30 min. Kinase assays were performed in a 50-µl reaction consisting of 10 µl of substrate (20 µg of MBP or 1 µg of recombinant c-Jun (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.), 1 µg of recombinant c-Fos, 10 µg of histone H1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 µg of histone H3 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), GST-CTD, or GST-JunD; 10 µl of [γ-32P]ATP mixture (1 µl of 10 mCi, 6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted with proteins eluted in 9 µl of 75 µm MgCl2 and 500 µm ATP in Assay Buffer), and 30 µl of Kinase Assay Buffer for 15 min at 30 °C. In vivo metabolic labeling of JB6 Cl30 7b cells with Translabel (ICN, Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) was performed as described (39Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo metabolic labeling of HT29 cells with Tran35S-label was performed as described (39Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that labeling was done overnight in cells plated at 6 × 106 cells/150-mm tissue culture dish. Two-dimensional non-equilibrium pH gradient gel electrophoresis (NEPHGE two-dimensional gels) was performed as described (39Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pH 3.5 to 10 and pH 5.0 to 7.0 ampholines were from Pierce. To determine whether ERK-related proteins (ERPs) interact in vivo with AP-1 components, we performed immunoprecipitations of 35S-metabolically labeled mouse epidermal JB6 Cl30 7b and human HT29 colon adenocarcinoma whole cell extracts with MAP kinase and AP-1 antibodies, followed by comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (two-dimensional gels). As shown in Fig. 1, the PAN-ERK antibody αERK1-III immunoprecipitates ERK2, since a major spot immunoprecipitated by αERK1-III has identical mobility to ERK2 immunoprecipitated by specific anti-ERK2 (compare protein spots in Fig.1, panels 1 and 2; see Ref. 39Bernstein L.R. Ferris D.K. Colburn N.H. Sobel M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9401-9404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).
