https://openalex.org/W2085652695,"Despite the enormous replication potential of the human liver, there are currently no culture systems available that sustain hepatocyte replication and/or function in vitro. We have shown previously that single mouse Lgr5+ liver stem cells can be expanded as epithelial organoids in vitro and can be differentiated into functional hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. We now describe conditions allowing long-term expansion of adult bile duct-derived bipotent progenitor cells from human liver. The expanded cells are highly stable at the chromosome and structural level, while single base changes occur at very low rates. The cells can readily be converted into functional hepatocytes in vitro and upon transplantation in vivo. Organoids from α1-antitrypsin deficiency and Alagille syndrome patients mirror the in vivo pathology. Clonal long-term expansion of primary adult liver stem cells opens up experimental avenues for disease modeling, toxicology studies, regenerative medicine, and gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2087216143,"Despite three decades of successful, predominantly phenotype-driven discovery of the genetic causes of monogenic disorders, up to half of children with severe developmental disorders of probable genetic origin remain without a genetic diagnosis. Particularly challenging are those disorders rare enough to have eluded recognition as a discrete clinical entity, those with highly variable clinical manifestations, and those that are difficult to distinguish from other, very similar, disorders. Here we demonstrate the power of using an unbiased genotype-driven approach to identify subsets of patients with similar disorders. By studying 1,133 children with severe, undiagnosed developmental disorders, and their parents, using a combination of exome sequencing and array-based detection of chromosomal rearrangements, we discovered 12 novel genes associated with developmental disorders. These newly implicated genes increase by 10% (from 28% to 31%) the proportion of children that could be diagnosed. Clustering of missense mutations in six of these newly implicated genes suggests that normal development is being perturbed by an activating or dominant-negative mechanism. Our findings demonstrate the value of adopting a comprehensive strategy, both genome-wide and nationwide, to elucidate the underlying causes of rare genetic disorders."

We have applied this principle to generate synthetic CRISPR-based transcriptional programs in yeast and human cells.

Sets of scaffold RNAs can be used to generate synthetic multigene transcriptional programs in which some genes are activated and others are repressed. We apply this approach to flexibly redirect flux through a complex branched metabolic pathway in yeast. Moreover, these programs can be executed by inducing expression of the dCas9 protein, which acts as a single master regulatory control point.

CRISPR-associated RNA scaffolds provide a powerful way to construct synthetic gene expression programs for a wide range of applications, including rewiring cell fates or engineering metabolic pathways. Eukaryotic cells achieve many different states by executing complex transcriptional programs that allow a single genome to be interpreted in numerous, distinct ways. In these programs, specific loci throughout the genome must be regulated independently. For example, during development, it is often critical to activate sets of genes associated with a new cell fate while simultaneously repressing sets of genes associated with a prior or alternative fate. Similarly, environmental conditions often trigger shifts in metabolic state, which requires activating a new set of enzymes and repressing other previously expressed enzymes, leading to new metabolic fluxes. These complex multi-locus, multi-directional expression programs are encoded largely by the pattern of transcriptional activators, repressors, or other regulators that assemble at distinct sites in the genome. Reprogramming these instructions to produce a different cell type or state thus requires precisely targeted changes in gene expression over a broad set of genes. How might we engineer novel gene expression programs that match the sophistication of natural programs? Such capabilities would provide powerful tools to probe how changes in gene expression programs lead to diverse cell types. These tools would also provide the ability to engineer more sophisticated designer cell types for therapeutic or biotechnological applications. Although a number of transcriptional engineering platforms have been developed, there are major constraints for constructing complex transcriptional programs. For example, synthetic transcription factors (such as designed zinc fingers or transcription activator-like [TAL] effectors) can target a specific regulatory action to a key genomic locus, but it is challenging to simultaneously target many loci in parallel because each DNA-binding protein must be individually designed and tested (Gaj et al., 2013Gaj T.

ZFN, TALEN, and CRISPR/Cas-based methods for genome engineering.Trends Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 397-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2481) Google Scholar). The bacterial type II CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) interference system (CRISPRi) provides an alternative suite of tools for genome regulation (Qi et al., 2013Qi L.S. Larson M.H. Gilbert L.A. Doudna J.A. Weissman J.S. Arkin A.P. Lim W.A. Repurposing CRISPR as an RNA-guided platform for sequence-specific control of gene expression.Cell. 2013; 152: 1173-1183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2996) Google Scholar). In particular, a catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9) protein, which lacks endonuclease activity, can be used to flexibly target many loci in parallel by using Cas9-binding guide RNAs that recognize target DNA sequences based only on predictable Watson-Crick base pairing. CRISPRi regulation can be used to achieve activation or repression by fusing dCas9 to activator or repressor modules (Gilbert et al., 2013Gilbert L.A. Larson M.H. Morsut L. Liu Z. Brar G.A. Torres S.E. Stern-Ginossar N. Brandman O. Whitehead E.H.

CAS9 transcriptional activators for target specificity screening and paired nickases for cooperative genome engineering.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar), but these direct protein fusions are constrained to only one direction of regulation. Thus, it remains challenging to engineer regulatory programs in which many loci are targeted simultaneously but with distinct types of regulation at each locus. To develop a platform for synthetic genome regulation that allows locus-specific action, we took inspiration from natural regulatory systems that encode both target specificity and regulatory function in the same molecule. In cell-signaling pathways, scaffold proteins act to physically assemble interacting components so that functional outcomes can be precisely controlled in time and space (Good et al., 2011Good M.C. Zalatan J.G. Lim W.A. Scaffold proteins: hubs for controlling the flow of cellular information.Science. 2011; 332: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Similar scaffolding principles apply in genome organization, wherein, for example, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) molecules are proposed to act as assembly scaffolds that recruit key epigenetic modifiers to specific genomic loci (Figure 1A) (Rinn and Chang, 2012Rinn J.L. Chang H.Y. Genome regulation by long noncoding RNAs.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar, Spitale et al., 2011Spitale R.C. Tsai M.-C. Chang H.Y. RNA templating the epigenome: long noncoding RNAs as molecular scaffolds.Epigenetics. 2011; 6: 539-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The idea that RNA can be used to coordinate biological assemblies has important implications for engineering. RNA is inherently modular and programmable: DNA targets can be recognized by base pairing, and modular RNA-protein interaction domains can be used to recruit specific proteins (Figure 1A). The ability of engineered RNA scaffolds to coordinate functional protein assemblies has already been elegantly demonstrated (Delebecque et al., 2011Delebecque C.J. Lindner A.B. Silver P.A. Aldaye F.A. Organization of intracellular reactions with rationally designed RNA assemblies.Science. 2011; 333: 470-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). To implement a synthetic, modular RNA-based system for locus-specific transcriptional programming, we can extend the CRISPR single-guide RNA (sgRNA) sequence with modular RNA domains that recruit RNA-binding proteins. This approach converts the sgRNA into a scaffold RNA (scRNA) that physically links DNA binding and protein recruitment activities (Figure 1B). Critically, a single scRNA molecule encodes both information about the target locus and instructions about what regulatory function to execute at that locus. This approach allows multidirectional regulation (i.e., simultaneous activation and repression) of different target genes as part of the same regulatory program. Engineering multivalent RNA recruitment sites on each scRNA offers the further possibility of independently tuning the strength of activation or repression at each target site. The potential viability of this approach is supported by a recent report showing that a sgRNA extended with MS2 hairpins can recruit activators to a reporter gene in human cells (Mali et al., 2013aMali P. Aach J. Stranges P.B. Esvelt K.M. Moosburner M. Kosuri S. Yang L. Church G.M. CAS9 transcriptional activators for target specificity screening and paired nickases for cooperative genome engineering.Nat. Biotechnol. 2013; 31: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR sgRNAs can be repurposed as scaffolding molecules to recruit transcriptional activators or repressors, thus enabling flexible and parallel programmable locus-specific regulation. We use the budding yeast S. cerevisiae as a testbed to identify three orthogonal RNA-protein binding modules and to optimize scRNA designs for single and multivalent recruitment sites. We show that the system developed in yeast also functions efficiently in human cells to regulate reporter and endogenous target genes, and we extend its scope to include recruitment of chromatin modifiers for gene repression. We then demonstrate the use of CRISPR scaffold RNA molecules to construct synthetic multigene expression programs. Specifically, we are able to regulate multiple genes in a highly branched biosynthetic pathway in yeast to express key enzymes in alternative combinations. These synthetic transcriptional programs, by combinatorially altering metabolic organization, allow us to flexibly redirect the pathway between five distinct possible product output states. Finally, we show that dCas9 can act as a master regulator of these gene expression programs, receiving input signals and acting as a single control point to execute a multigene response encompassing simultaneous activation and repression of downstream target genes. The minimal sgRNA previously used in CRISPR engineering consists of several modular domains: a 20 nucleotide variable DNA-targeting sequence and two structured RNA domains—dCas9-binding and 3′ tracrRNA—which are necessary for proper structure formation and binding to Cas9 (Jinek et al., 2012Jinek M. Chylinski K. Fonfara I. Hauer M. Doudna J.A. Charpentier E.

Here, to generate scaffold RNA (scRNA) constructs with additional protein recruitment capabilities, we first introduced a single RNA hairpin domain to the 3′ end of the sgRNA, connected by a two-base linker. For these recruitment RNA modules, we used the well-characterized viral RNA sequences MS2, PP7, and com, which are recognized by the MCP, PCP, and Com RNA-binding proteins, respectively. We fused the transcriptional activation domain VP64 to each of the corresponding RNA-binding proteins. We first tested the CRISPR scRNA platform in yeast. A strain with a tet promoter driving a fluorescent protein reporter was transformed to express dCas9, scRNAs targeting the tet operator, and the corresponding VP64 fusion proteins. We observed significant reporter gene expression using each of the three RNA-binding recruitment modules (Figure 2A). scRNA constructs with recruitment hairpin domains connected to the sgRNA by linkers longer than two bases (up to 20 bases) gave weaker reporter gene expression (Figure S1A available online). scRNA designs with recruitment sequences attached to the 5′ end of the sgRNA gave no significant activation (Figure S1B). Northern blot analysis indicated that the 5′ extended sequence was degraded (Figure S2).Figure S1Optimization of scRNA Designs, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) A two base linker between sgRNA and a single MS2 hairpin produces the strongest reporter gene activation.

Steady-state levels for unmodified sgRNA, 1x, and 2x scRNA designs are similar, and the observed activity differences reflect functional differences in the recruitment domains (Figure 2). The 5′-32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotide used as a probe hybridizes in the dCas9-binding domain of the sgRNA. Each sgRNA and scRNA construct gives a distinct, three-band pattern that most likely corresponds to read-through of the T6 terminator sequence (Braglia et al., 2005Braglia P. Percudani R. Dieci G.

These results suggest that the 5′ modules are degraded, consistent with the functional data showing no reporter gene activation from 5′ recruitment modules (Figure S1B).(C) Expression of a 1x MS2 scRNA construct from a pol II promoter (the RGR cassette, Figure S1D) produces a discrete band at the expected size of 125 bases.

Expression of the same construct from a pol III promoter (SNR52) produces multiple bands. In mammalian cells, expression of an sgRNA from a pol III promoter gives a single discrete band (U6-driven expression in HEK293T cells, see Experimental Procedures). Gene activation mediated by scRNA recruitment of VP64 was substantially greater than that for the direct dCas9-VP64 fusion protein. Both MCP and PCP bind to their RNA targets as dimers (Chao et al., 2008Chao J.A. Patskovsky Y. Almo S.C. Singer R.H. Structural basis for the coevolution of a viral RNA-protein complex.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 103-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which may account for some of the difference. The oligomerization state of the Com protein has not been directly determined, but functional data consistent with a monomer has been reported (Wulczyn and Kahmann, 1991Wulczyn F.G. Kahmann R. Translational stimulation: RNA sequence and structure requirements for binding of Com protein.Cell. 1991; 65: 259-269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is crosstalk between RNA hairpins and non-cognate-binding proteins (e.g., MS2 RNA recruiting the PCP protein), we expressed all three RNA hairpin designs (MS2, PP7, and com) in yeast strains containing either the MCP, PCP, or Com fusion proteins. We used a 7× tetO reporter to maximize sensitivity for detecting any weak cross-activation. No significant crosstalk was detected between mismatched pairs of scRNA sequences and binding proteins (Figure 2B). The strong activation of reporter gene expression only with cognate scRNA- and RNA-binding protein pairs demonstrates the potential for simultaneous, independent regulation of multiple target genes. To tune the valency of effectors recruited to each gene target, we introduced one, two, or three MS2 RNA hairpins to the 3′ end of the sgRNA. Surprisingly, reporter gene expression decreased with increasing numbers of MS2 hairpins (Figure S1C). Northern blot analysis indicated that steady-state RNA levels decreased with two or three MS2 hairpins, suggesting that RNA expression or stability is limiting for these constructs (Figure S2A). To address the apparent stability problem of multi-hairpin scRNAs, we constructed an alternative RNA design in which double-stranded linkers were inserted between the two repeats of the recruitment hairpins to enforce stable, local hairpin formation. These alternative designs produced stronger reporter gene activation for both MS2 and PP7 modules relative to the analogous single-hairpin scRNAs (Figure 2C). Northern blot analysis of the 2× constructs with double-stranded linkers indicated steady-state RNA levels comparable to single-hairpin scRNA and unmodified sgRNA constructs (Figure S2A). The strongest activation for a single scRNA construct was obtained with a mixed hairpin construct containing two different recruitment motifs for the MCP-VP64 effector protein (2× MS2 [WT + f6])—this construct contained one MS2 hairpin and a second aptamer hairpin (f6) that had been selected to bind to the MCP protein (Hirao et al., 1998–1999Hirao I. Spingola M. Peabody D. Ellington A.D. The limits of specificity: an experimental analysis with RNA aptamers to MS2 coat protein variants.Mol. Divers. 1998–1999; 4: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Attempts to design 2× constructs with double-stranded linkers using the com RNA module were unsuccessful, possibly because the cognate Com protein binds to single-stranded RNA at the base of the com hairpin (Hattman, 1999Hattman S. Unusual transcriptional and translational regulation of the bacteriophage Mu mom operon.Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 367-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). RNA constructs with three MS2 hairpins connected by double-stranded linkers did not improve reporter gene expression beyond that obtained with the 2× MS2 scRNA. Northern blot analysis suggests that these constructs are stably expressed, so the lack of increased expression may be a result of misfolding or steric constraints. To develop a platform for recruitment of more complex protein assemblies, we designed a heterologous MS2-PP7 scRNA sequence using the 2× double-stranded linker structure. Reporter gene activation was substantially stronger in yeast cells with both MCP-VP64 and PCP-VP64 effector proteins compared to cells with only a single type of effector protein, indicating that distinct RNA-binding proteins can be recruited to the same target site (Figure 2D). This provides an effective approach to combinatorially recruit multiple effectors for the logical control of target genes. To test the efficacy of scRNA-based protein effector recruitment in human cells, we ported the system from yeast to HEK293T cells. The dCas9-binding hairpin of the sgRNA was modified as described previously to improve activity in human cells (see Extended Experimental Procedures) (Chen et al., 2013Chen B. Gilbert L.A. Cimini B.A. Schnitzbauer J. Zhang W. Li G.-W. Park J. Blackburn E.H. Weissman J.S. Qi L.S. Huang B. Dynamic imaging of genomic loci in living human cells by an optimized CRISPR/Cas system.Cell. 2013; 155: 1479-1491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). In HEK293T cells expressing dCas9, expression of an scRNA with the corresponding VP64 fusion protein effector produced substantial activation of a 7× tet-driven GFP reporter gene for all three RNA-binding modules (Figure 3A), although there are some quantitative differences from the activity trends observed in yeast. GFP activation with 1× MS2 and 1× PP7 scRNA constructs was relatively weak compared to both corresponding multivalent 2× scRNA constructs and the dCas9-VP64 fusion protein. To determine whether endogenous genes could be activated by targeting a single site upstream of the coding sequence, we designed ten target sequences for the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) (Table S3). CXCR4 expression is low in HEK293T cells, and changes in gene expression can be quantified at the single-cell level by antibody staining. CXCR4 has previously been a target for CRISPR-based gene silencing in cell types with high basal expression levels (Gilbert et al., 2013Gilbert L.A. Larson M.H. Morsut L. Liu Z. Brar G.A. Torres S.E. Stern-Ginossar N. Brandman O. Whitehead E.H. Doudna J.A. et al.CRISPR-mediated modular RNA-guided regulation of transcription in eukaryotes.Cell. 2013; 154: 442-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2254) Google Scholar). We used the divalent 2× MS2 (WT + f6) scRNA design to recruit the MCP-VP64 protein, and we observed increases in CXCR4 protein levels for nine of the ten target sites (Figure S3). For the three strongest target sites, we compared CXCR4 activation mediated by scRNA to that with dCas9-VP64 and observed consistently stronger output with scRNA (Figure 3B). In human cells, CRISPRi-mediated repression is relatively modest but can be enhanced by fusing dCas9 to the KRAB domain (Gilbert et al., 2013Gilbert L.A. Larson M.H. Morsut L. Liu Z. Brar G.A. Torres S.E. Stern-Ginossar N. Brandman O. Whitehead E.H.

https://openalex.org/W2094558708,"Obesity is an increasingly prevalent disease regulated by genetic and environmental factors. Emerging studies indicate that immune cells, including monocytes, granulocytes and lymphocytes, regulate metabolic homeostasis and are dysregulated in obesity. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) can regulate adaptive immunity and eosinophil and alternatively activated macrophage responses, and were recently identified in murine white adipose tissue (WAT) where they may act to limit the development of obesity. However, ILC2s have not been identified in human adipose tissue, and the mechanisms by which ILC2s regulate metabolic homeostasis remain unknown. Here we identify ILC2s in human WAT and demonstrate that decreased ILC2 responses in WAT are a conserved characteristic of obesity in humans and mice. Interleukin (IL)-33 was found to be critical for the maintenance of ILC2s in WAT and in limiting adiposity in mice by increasing caloric expenditure. This was associated with recruitment of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)(+) beige adipocytes in WAT, a process known as beiging or browning that regulates caloric expenditure. IL-33-induced beiging was dependent on ILC2s, and IL-33 treatment or transfer of IL-33-elicited ILC2s was sufficient to drive beiging independently of the adaptive immune system, eosinophils or IL-4 receptor signalling. We found that ILC2s produce methionine-enkephalin peptides that can act directly on adipocytes to upregulate Ucp1 expression in vitro and that promote beiging in vivo. Collectively, these studies indicate that, in addition to responding to infection or tissue damage, ILC2s can regulate adipose function and metabolic homeostasis in part via production of enkephalin peptides that elicit beiging."
https://openalex.org/W1996934645,"The plant cell wall is an important factor for determining cell shape, function and response to the environment. Secondary cell walls, such as those found in xylem, are composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin and account for the bulk of plant biomass. The coordination between transcriptional regulation of synthesis for each polymer is complex and vital to cell function. A regulatory hierarchy of developmental switches has been proposed, although the full complement of regulators remains unknown. Here we present a protein–DNA network between Arabidopsis thaliana transcription factors and secondary cell wall metabolic genes with gene expression regulated by a series of feed-forward loops. This model allowed us to develop and validate new hypotheses about secondary wall gene regulation under abiotic stress. Distinct stresses are able to perturb targeted genes to potentially promote functional adaptation. These interactions will serve as a foundation for understanding the regulation of a complex, integral plant component. The full complement of transcriptional regulators that affect synthesis of the plant secondary cell wall remains largely undetermined; here, the network of protein–DNA interactions controlling secondary cell wall synthesis of Arabidopsis thaliana is determined, showing that gene expression is regulated by a series of feed-forward loops to ensure that the secondary cell wall is deposited at the right time and in the right place. The plant cell wall determines cell shape and mediates communication with the cellular environment. But it is the secondary cell wall — deposited in various cell types including xylem — that is the main source of biomass used for biofuels and in the pulp and paper industry. The full complement of transcriptional regulators that affect biosynthesis of secondary cell wall remains largely undetermined. Siobhan Brady and colleagues describe a gene regulatory network involving hundreds of transcription factors that controls the formation of xylem in the plant Arabidopsis through protein–DNA interactions. Gene expression is regulated by a series of feed-forward loops to ensure that secondary cell wall is deposited at the right time and in the right place. The authors use their gene regulatory network to develop new hypotheses about the effect of abiotic stress, such as salinity and iron deprivation, on secondary cell wall gene regulation, and to validate these hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W1980544777,"Broadly, tissue regeneration is achieved in two ways: by proliferation of common differentiated cells and/or by deployment of specialized stem/progenitor cells. Which of these pathways applies is both organ- and injury-specific. Current models in the lung posit that epithelial repair can be attributed to cells expressing mature lineage markers. By contrast, here we define the regenerative role of previously uncharacterized, rare lineage-negative epithelial stem/progenitor (LNEP) cells present within normal distal lung. Quiescent LNEPs activate a ΔNp63 (a p63 splice variant) and cytokeratin 5 remodelling program after influenza or bleomycin injury in mice. Activated cells proliferate and migrate widely to occupy heavily injured areas depleted of mature lineages, at which point they differentiate towards mature epithelium. Lineage tracing revealed scant contribution of pre-existing mature epithelial cells in such repair, whereas orthotopic transplantation of LNEPs, isolated by a definitive surface profile identified through single-cell sequencing, directly demonstrated the proliferative capacity and multipotency of this population. LNEPs require Notch signalling to activate the ΔNp63 and cytokeratin 5 program, and subsequent Notch blockade promotes an alveolar cell fate. Persistent Notch signalling after injury led to parenchymal 'micro-honeycombing' (alveolar cysts), indicative of failed regeneration. Lungs from patients with fibrosis show analogous honeycomb cysts with evidence of hyperactive Notch signalling. Our findings indicate that distinct stem/progenitor cell pools repopulate injured tissue depending on the extent of the injury, and the outcomes of regeneration or fibrosis may depend in part on the dynamics of LNEP Notch signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2042745266,"Intrinsically disordered proteins play important roles in cell signalling, transcription, translation and cell cycle regulation. Although they lack stable tertiary structure, many intrinsically disordered proteins undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding to partners. Similarly, several folded proteins use regulated order-to-disorder transitions to mediate biological function. In principle, the function of intrinsically disordered proteins may be controlled by post-translational modifications that lead to structural changes such as folding, although this has not been observed. Here we show that multisite phosphorylation induces folding of the intrinsically disordered 4E-BP2, the major neural isoform of the family of three mammalian proteins that bind eIF4E and suppress cap-dependent translation initiation. In its non-phosphorylated state, 4E-BP2 interacts tightly with eIF4E using both a canonical YXXXXLΦ motif (starting at Y54) that undergoes a disorder-to-helix transition upon binding and a dynamic secondary binding site. We demonstrate that phosphorylation at T37 and T46 induces folding of residues P18-R62 of 4E-BP2 into a four-stranded β-domain that sequesters the helical YXXXXLΦ motif into a partly buried β-strand, blocking its accessibility to eIF4E. The folded state of pT37pT46 4E-BP2 is weakly stable, decreasing affinity by 100-fold and leading to an order-to-disorder transition upon binding to eIF4E, whereas fully phosphorylated 4E-BP2 is more stable, decreasing affinity by a factor of approximately 4,000. These results highlight stabilization of a phosphorylation-induced fold as the essential mechanism for phospho-regulation of the 4E-BP:eIF4E interaction and exemplify a new mode of biological regulation mediated by intrinsically disordered proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2038274440,"Abnormal NFκB activation has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the signaling pathways governing NFκB regulation and function in the brain are poorly understood. We identify complement protein C3 as an astroglial target of NFκB and show that C3 release acts through neuronal C3aR to disrupt dendritic morphology and network function. Exposure to Aβ activates astroglial NFκB and C3 release, consistent with the high levels of C3 expression in brain tissue from AD patients and APP transgenic mice, where C3aR antagonist treatment rescues cognitive impairment. Therefore, dysregulation of neuron-glia interaction through NFκB/C3/C3aR signaling may contribute to synaptic dysfunction in AD, and C3aR antagonists may be therapeutically beneficial."

https://openalex.org/W2030428080,"Synaptic efficacy and precision are influenced by the coupling of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCs) to vesicles. But because the topography of VGCCs and their proximity to vesicles is unknown, a quantitative understanding of the determinants of vesicular release at nanometer scale is lacking. To investigate this, we combined freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling of Cav2.1 channels, local [Ca2+] imaging, and patch pipette perfusion of EGTA at the calyx of Held. Between postnatal day 7 and 21, VGCCs formed variable sized clusters and vesicular release became less sensitive to EGTA, whereas fixed Ca2+ buffer properties remained constant. Experimentally constrained reaction-diffusion simulations suggest that Ca2+ sensors for vesicular release are located at the perimeter of VGCC clusters (<30 nm) and predict that VGCC number per cluster determines vesicular release probability without altering release time course. This “perimeter release model” provides a unifying framework accounting for developmental changes in both synaptic efficacy and time course."

The majority of adult neural circuits rely on activity-dependent synaptic modification as a primary mechanism for experience-induced plasticity, which is central to adaptive behavior and learning (Caroni et al., 2012Caroni P.

The dentate gyrus of the hippocampus is a cortical structure involved in memory encoding that, in addition to synaptic plasticity, relies on the continuous generation of new dentate granule cells (GCs) throughout life. GCs, the principal neurons of the dentate gyrus, assemble the granule cell layer (GCL) that is characterized by its sparse activity (Chawla et al., 2005Chawla M.K. Guzowski J.F. Ramirez-Amaya V.

They receive primarily excitatory projections from the entorhinal cortex and inhibitory inputs from local interneurons. Their axons (mossy fibers) contact GABAergic interneurons, hilar mossy cells, and pyramidal cells located in the CA3 pyramidal layer (Acsády et al., 1998Acsády L. Kamondi A. Sík A. Freund T.

While the relevance of neurogenesis in hippocampal function has been validated, the precise contribution of adult-born neurons to circuit plasticity and, consequently, information processing, is still unclear.

GCs become mature after developing for 6–8 weeks, at which time they are both morphologically and functionally very similar to GCs born during perinatal development; they receive excitatory inputs from the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex and inhibitory inputs from local interneurons including parvalbumin+ cells, somatostatin+ cells, HICAP cells, MOPP cells, and neurogliaform cells (Deshpande et al., 2013Deshpande A.

Moreover, a delay in the establishment of mature perisomatic inhibition results in a high excitation/inhibition balance that confers immature GC low activation threshold and low input specificity, consequently becoming a highly active neuronal population that is immersed within a principal layer (the GCL) characterized by sparse activity (Dieni et al., 2013Dieni C.V.

A puzzling question then emerges directly from those findings: do young GCs with low input specificity contribute to dentate gyrus function? To address this problem it is important to define the developmental stage at which new GCs become functionally relevant to the local networks in a manner that can influence information processing (i.e., alter input/output properties in the dentate). We reasoned that the specific function of adult-born GCs might be better understood after identifying the local networks they recruit along their transition from immature to fully mature, which has remained unknown. Here we have addressed a set of simple questions to test the hypothesis that activation of immature versus mature adult-born GCs would recruit distinct postsynaptic targets cells and networks, and thus impinge differentially on the activity of the principal layers. We show that output networks switch as GCs mature. Most remarkably, immature GCs exert poor feedback control over their neighbor neurons. Upon maturation, mossy fibers recruit proximal interneurons responsible for feedback inhibition (FBI) capable of attenuating GCL activity. Our data reveal that immature GCs are poorly coupled to GABAergic inhibition at a time that is coincident with the critical period of low activation threshold and enhanced synaptic plasticity. Remarkably, as GCs mature (and exit the critical period), they begin to recruit and respond to inhibitory feedback. We present a computational model that supports the notion that the delayed coupling to FBI in adult-born GCs provides an efficient mechanism for input discrimination in the dentate gyrus. The GCL comprises a heterogeneous population of GCs generated at different times from development to adulthood, with more than 80% of the GCs generated postnatally (Altman and Bayer, 1990Altman J.

Hence, understanding the impact of dentate gyrus (DG) activity requires dissecting the output of those distinct neuronal populations. We have considered three major populations of principal neurons: mature GCs generated during adulthood, newly generated young (immature) GCs, and GCs generated during early postnatal development (see Figure S1A available online). In this study, young GCs correspond to 4-week-old neurons, whereas mature GCs are >7 weeks old. To characterize the local circuits activated by GCs generated during early postnatal development, we selectively expressed the light-activated channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in GCs generated in the early postnatal DG and analyzed their output during adulthood. We utilized Ascl1CreERT2;CAGfloxStopChR2 mice to allow indelible targeting of ChR2 in Ascl1-expressing neural progenitor cells and performed tamoxifen (TAM) induction at postnatal day 11 (P11), thus rendering ChR2 expression in GCs generated from P11 onward (Kim et al., 2007Kim E.J.

Electrophysiological recordings in acute slices were performed 9 weeks later (Figures 1A and 1B ). Due to the pronounced decrease in DG neurogenesis that occurs during early postnatal life (Mathews et al., 2010Mathews E.A. Morgenstern N.A. Piatti V.C. Zhao C. Jessberger S. Schinder A.F. Gage F.H. A distinctive layering pattern of mouse dentate granule cells is generated by developmental and adult neurogenesis.J. Comp. Neurol. 2010; 518: 4479-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), the neuronal population expressing ChR2 is greatly enriched in GCs generated around the time of TAM induction. In agreement with this notion, the majority of ChR2-expressing GCs (ChR2-GCs) expressed the neuronal marker calbindin and displayed mature GC morphology with complex spiny dendrites extending through the molecular layer and axons projecting through the hilus reaching the distal CA3 pyramidal layer (Figures 1C and S1B). The output of this population enriched in mature ChR2-GCs generated during postnatal development was assessed by stimulation using brief (1 ms) blue laser pulses delivered through the microscope objective. Light stimulation triggered action potentials in ChR2-GCs with high efficacy (1 spike/pulse, Figure 1D). To monitor light-evoked synaptic responses, whole-cell recordings were performed in CA3 pyramidal cells under conditions that allowed discriminating excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) as inward (negative) or outward (positive) deflections (Figure 1E). In voltage-clamp recordings obtained at depolarized holding potentials (∼0 mV, the reversal potential for glutamatergic responses), light-mediated ChR2-GC stimulation reliably elicited IPSCs that were blocked by either the GABAA-receptor antagonist picrotoxin (PTX) or by the AMPA/NMDA glutamatergic antagonist kynurenic acid (KYN). This result indicates that IPSCs depend both on glutamate and GABA release, consistent with a feedforward inhibitory (FFI) loop ChR2-GC → GABA interneuron → pyramidal cell (Figures 1E, 1F1, 1F2, and 1F4). In recordings obtained at negative holding potentials (∼−70 mV, the reversal potential for GABAergic responses), light-mediated ChR2-GC stimulation reliably elicited EPSCs that were blocked by KYN, but not PTX, reflecting the canonical mossy fiber-CA3 glutamatergic connection that carries dentate output to the CA3 pyramidal layer (Figures 1E, 1F3, and 1F4). We then performed whole-cell recordings in unlabeled mature GCs located in the outer third of the GCL, primarily generated during development (Marín-Burgin et al., 2012Marín-Burgin A. Mongiat L.A. Pardi M.B. Schinder A.F. Unique processing during a period of high excitation/inhibition balance in adult-born neurons.Science. 2012; 335: 1238-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, Mathews et al., 2010Mathews E.A.

Neurol. 2010; 518: 4479-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Stimulation of ChR2-GCs elicited IPSCs that were also blocked by either KYN or PTX, now revealing the disynaptic feedback loop ChR2-GC → GABA interneuron → GC (Figures 1G and 1H1–1H3). No feedback excitatory responses were found. These results identify feedback and feedforward interneurons as well as CA3 pyramidal cells as targets of a neuronal population enriched in mature GCs generated during early postnatal development. To map the networks activated by adult-born neurons, we selectively expressed ChR2 by retroviral transduction of neural progenitor cells of the adult DG. A retrovirus expressing ChR2-EGFP was delivered to the DG of adult mice, and acute slices were prepared 4 or 7 weeks postinjection (wpi), revealing substantial numbers of ChR2-GCs at both time points (Figures 2A and 2B ). Network activation by light-induced stimulation of 4- (young) or 7-week-old (mature) GCs was compared in electrophysiological recordings (Figure 2C). First, loose patch recordings were carried out to measure the reliability of brief (1 ms) laser pulses to induce spiking. In both young and mature ChR2-GCs, light pulses triggered spikes with similar efficacy (about 1 spike/light pulse, Figure 2D) and latency (<4 ms; Figure S2A). We then investigated the CA3 networks recruited by adult-born ChR2-GCs by means of whole-cell recordings in pyramidal cells. In voltage-clamp recordings obtained at 0 mV, laser-mediated stimulation of both young and mature ChR2-GCs elicited GABAergic IPSCs with similar kinetics and synaptic charge (Figures 2E, 2H, and S2A). Although IPSC charge was somewhat larger for mature ChR2-GCs, such increase was minor compared to what is described below for FBI. In recordings obtained at negative holding potentials (−70 mV), optogenetic stimulation elicited glutamatergic EPSCs that also displayed similar kinetics and synaptic charge for both young and mature ChR2-GCs (Figures 2E, 2I, and S2A). EPSCs and IPSCs were completely blocked by the AMPA-subtype glutamate receptor antagonist NBQX (Figure 2G, upper and middle panels), revealing the presence of excitation (mossy fiber → pyramidal cell contacts) and feedforward GABAergic inhibition (ChR2-GC → GABA interneuron → pyramidal cell) pathways onto the CA3 principal layer, similarly to what was described above for mature GCs generated during early postnatal development. These results indicate that although 4 wpi adult-born GCs are still immature, they have already established reliable output connectivity within the CA3 region. To interrogate the local networks activated by proximal (hilar) mossy fiber contacts, whole-cell recordings were performed in unlabeled mature GCs located in the outer third of the GCL. Laser stimulation of mature adult-born ChR2-GCs elicited reliable IPSCs on neighboring GCs (Figure 2F). IPSCs were fully blocked by NBQX, which reveals that responses correspond to a feedback inhibitory loop ChR2-GC → GABA interneuron → GC (Figure 2G bottom panel). In striking contrast, laser stimulation of young ChR2-GCs elicited small IPSCs on neighbor GCs, revealing a poor recruitment of FBI (Figures 2F and 2J). Such weak responses were the consequence of the combined effects of small amplitude and low success probability of IPSCs (Figure S2A). Note that the increase in IPSC charge corresponding to FBI from 4 to 8 wpi is about 4-fold the change observed for FFI described above. Thus, adult-born GCs establish distal synapses onto CA3 interneurons and pyramidal cells that are largely developed by 4 wpi, while functional connectivity of proximal mossy fiber contacts responsible for FBI onto the GCL is delayed. We also tested the ability of young and mature adult-born GCs to exert FBI during patterns of activity that resemble those occurring during hippocampus-dependent behaviors (Leutgeb et al., 2007Leutgeb J.K. Leutgeb S. Moser M.B. Moser E.I. Pattern separation in the dentate gyrus and CA3 of the hippocampus.Science. 2007; 315: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). ChR2-GCs were stimulated in the range of theta frequency (10 Hz pulses), and whole-cell recordings were performed in unlabeled mature GCs of the external GCL (Figure S2B). Interestingly, the strong inhibitory feedback recruited by mature GCs showed substantial depression, whereas immature GCs activated a small but persistent inhibition, suggesting a differential degree of short-term plasticity within this feedback loop (Torborg et al., 2010Torborg C.L. Nakashiba T. Tonegawa S. McBain C.J. Control of CA3 output by feedforward inhibition despite developmental changes in the excitation-inhibition balance.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 15628-15637Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine the functional relevance of the GABAergic feedback loops recruited by adult-born GCs, we performed recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in the GCL to monitor the population spike (pop-spike) evoked by stimulation of the medial perforant path (mPP), a primary excitatory input to the DG. The pop-spike area reflects the number of GCs that spike synchronously to the input stimulus. Slices bearing young or mature adult-born ChR2-GCs received a brief pulse of blue light (2 ms) that was paired to the mPP stimulus to recruit FBI and measure its impact on the pop-spike amplitude (Figures 3A–3C). A single light prepulse delivered to mature ChR2-GCs was sufficient to greatly reduce (by ∼40%) mPP-induced pop-spike amplitude in a reliable and reversible manner (Figures 3C, 3E, and 3F). Pop-spike reduction was maximal when the light preceded mPP activation by 10 ms (“−10 ms,” Figure 3C), which is coincident with the onset timin"

There is great interest in understanding the stages and transitions of cell development as pluripotent cells follow the neuronal lineage. Here, Alexander Meissner and colleagues characterize the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of six consecutive stages as human embryonic stem cells differentiate along the neuronal lineage. The authors apply a powerful computational framework to the data and identify key regulators and their effects on the epigenetic remodelling during these consecutive stages of differentiation. Models derived from human pluripotent stem cells that accurately recapitulate neural development in vitro and allow for the generation of specific neuronal subtypes are of major interest to the stem cell and biomedical community. Notch signalling, particularly through the Notch effector HES5, is a major pathway critical for the onset and maintenance of neural progenitor cells in the embryonic and adult nervous system1,2,3. Here we report the transcriptional and epigenomic analysis of six consecutive neural progenitor cell stages derived from a HES5::eGFP reporter human embryonic stem cell line4. Using this system, we aimed to model cell-fate decisions including specification, expansion and patterning during the ontogeny of cortical neural stem and progenitor cells. In order to dissect regulatory mechanisms that orchestrate the stage-specific differentiation process, we developed a computational framework to infer key regulators of each cell-state transition based on the progressive remodelling of the epigenetic landscape and then validated these through a pooled short hairpin RNA screen. We were also able to refine our previous observations on epigenetic priming at transcription factor binding sites and suggest here that they are mediated by combinations of core and stage-specific factors. Taken together, we demonstrate the utility of our system and outline a general framework, not limited to the context of the neural lineage, to dissect regulatory circuits of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2030301369,"Collective behaviour in animal groups can improve individual perception and decision-making, but the neural mechanisms involved have been hard to access in classic models for these phenomena; here it is shown that Drosophila’s olfactory responses are enhanced in groups of flies, through mechanosensory neuron-dependent touch interactions. Schooling fish, flocking birds and human crowds can enhance the perception and decision-making of individuals in the group, but the neural mechanisms involved have been hard to determine. Richard Benton and colleagues use a more accessible model in which to study group behaviour: they show that weak odour-avoidance in individual fruitflies can be enhanced in groups of flies, thanks to cascades of appendage touch interactions between pairs of flies. By identifying the mechanosensory neurons and ion channels involved, the authors open the door to a neural-circuit dissection of collective behaviour in animal groups. Collective behaviour enhances environmental sensing and decision-making in groups of animals1,2. Experimental and theoretical investigations of schooling fish, flocking birds and human crowds have demonstrated that simple interactions between individuals can explain emergent group dynamics3,4. These findings indicate the existence of neural circuits that support distributed behaviours, but the molecular and cellular identities of relevant sensory pathways are unknown. Here we show that Drosophila melanogaster exhibits collective responses to an aversive odour: individual flies weakly avoid the stimulus, but groups show enhanced escape reactions. Using high-resolution behavioural tracking, computational simulations, genetic perturbations, neural silencing and optogenetic activation we demonstrate that this collective odour avoidance arises from cascades of appendage touch interactions between pairs of flies. Inter-fly touch sensing and collective behaviour require the activity of distal leg mechanosensory sensilla neurons and the mechanosensory channel NOMPC5,6. Remarkably, through these inter-fly encounters, wild-type flies can elicit avoidance behaviour in mutant animals that cannot sense the odour—a basic form of communication. Our data highlight the unexpected importance of social context in the sensory responses of a solitary species and open the door to a neural-circuit-level understanding of collective behaviour in animal groups."
https://openalex.org/W2014397333,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder. Functional interactions between some PD genes, like PINK1 and parkin, have been identified, but whether other ones interact remains elusive. Here we report an unexpected genetic interaction between two PD genes, VPS35 and EIF4G1. We provide evidence that EIF4G1 upregulation causes defects associated with protein misfolding. Expression of a sortilin protein rescues these defects, downstream of VPS35, suggesting a potential role for sortilins in PD. We also show interactions between VPS35, EIF4G1, and α-synuclein, a protein with a key role in PD. We extend our findings from yeast to an animal model and show that these interactions are conserved in neurons and in transgenic mice. Our studies reveal unexpected genetic and functional interactions between two seemingly unrelated PD genes and functionally connect them to α-synuclein pathobiology in yeast, worms, and mouse. Finally, we provide a resource of candidate PD genes for future interrogation."
https://openalex.org/W2092206243,"The kinetochore is the crucial apparatus regulating chromosome segregation in mitosis and meiosis. Particularly in meiosis I, unlike in mitosis, sister kinetochores are captured by microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole (mono-orientation) and centromeric cohesion mediated by cohesin is protected in the following anaphase. Although meiotic kinetochore factors have been identified only in budding and fission yeasts, these molecules and their functions are thought to have diverged earlier. Therefore, a conserved mechanism for meiotic kinetochore regulation remains elusive. Here we have identified in mouse a meiosis-specific kinetochore factor that we termed MEIKIN, which functions in meiosis I but not in meiosis II or mitosis. MEIKIN plays a crucial role in both mono-orientation and centromeric cohesion protection, partly by stabilizing the localization of the cohesin protector shugoshin. These functions are mediated mainly by the activity of Polo-like kinase PLK1, which is enriched to kinetochores in a MEIKIN-dependent manner. Our integrative analysis indicates that the long-awaited key regulator of meiotic kinetochore function is Meikin, which is conserved from yeasts to humans. The long elusive mammalian meiosis-specific kinetochore factor has been identified in mice; MEIKIN—which plays an equivalent role to the yeast proteins Spo13 and Moa1—ensures mono-orientation, protects sister chromatid cohesion and recruits the kinase PLK1 to the kinetochores. During the first of the meiotic cell divisions that generate germ cells, sister kinetochores are captured by microtubules from the same spindle pole so that sister chromatids can be segregated into the same daughter cell. Yoshinori Watanabe and colleagues have now identified MEIKIN as the long-sought-after meiosis-specific kinetochore factor that ensures mono-orientation and protects sister chromatid cohesion during the first meiotic division in mouse germ cells. It functions mainly by recruiting the kinase PLK1 to kinetochores. Previously identified budding and fission yeast proteins, Spo13 and Moa1, respectively, are shown to be functional homologues of MEIKIN, and the authors propose that together they form the 'Meikin' family of meiosis-I-specific kinetochore factors."

The Polycomb (Pc) system plays critical roles in eukaryotic biology by triggering the deposition of facultative heterochromatin. This type of chromatin is associated with two conserved protein complexes: PRC2, whose catalytic subunit (EZH2 in mammals and E(z) in Drosophila) is a histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase; and PRC1, which mediates chromatin compaction and histone H2A ubiquitylation (Simon and Kingston, 2009Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Mechanisms of polycomb gene silencing: knowns and unknowns.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 697-708Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PRC1 also contains a chromodomain protein, CBX/Pc, which recognizes H3K27 methylation (H3K27me). First identified in Drosophila as a mechanism responsible for epigenetic memory of developmental gene expression states, the Polycomb system is now appreciated to play key roles in mammalian development as well (Aloia et al., 2013Aloia L.

Diverse additional biological roles have been ascribed to the system in other contexts, ranging from the control of DNA elimination in ciliates to the coupling of flowering and cold exposure in plants (Chalker et al., 2013Chalker D.L.

Significantly, Polycomb plays a widespread role in human cancers. Redistribution of H3K27me domains has been observed in cancer genomes (Bender et al., 2013Bender S. Tang Y. Lindroth A.M.

Genet. 2013; 14: 765-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). These findings have driven efforts to develop chemotherapeutics aimed at the Polycomb system. The appropriate functioning of facultative heterochromatin requires its restricted deposition at the proper genomic sites. In Drosophila, DNA sequence elements called Polycomb response elements are bound by specific DNA-binding proteins that themselves recruit PRC2 (Simon and Kingston, 2013Simon J.A. Kingston R.E. Occupying chromatin: Polycomb mechanisms for getting to genomic targets, stopping transcriptional traffic, and staying put.Mol. Cell. 2013; 49: 808-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In mammals, however, analogous elements have yet to be identified. PRC2 localization and activity have been suggested to instead be controlled by a diverse set of inputs including DNA-binding proteins, DNA GC content, noncoding RNAs, nucleosome spacing, and numerous histone posttranslational modifications (Klose et al., 2013Klose R.J.

Further complicating the picture, recent studies have shown that H2A ubiquitylation can recruit PRC2 in order to promote H3K27me, thereby challenging the model that PRC2 recruitment acts upstream of PRC1 (Blackledge et al., 2014Blackledge N.P. Farcas A.M. Kondo T. King H.W. McGouran J.F. Hanssen L.L.P. Ito S. Cooper S. Kondo K.

Thus, the mechanisms that establish H3K27me domains remain highly enigmatic. A tractable yeast Polycomb system would enhance investigations of this evolutionarily conserved mechanism. Unfortunately, genes encoding PRC2 components were lost during the evolution of highly developed yeast systems such as S. cerevisiae and S. pombe (Shaver et al., 2010Shaver S. Casas-Mollano J.A. Cerny R.L. Cerutti H. Origin of the polycomb repressive complex 2 and gene silencing by an E(z) homolog in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas.Epigenetics. 2010; 5: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), precluding either from serving as such a model. Here, we identify and characterize a PRC2 complex in a budding yeast, Cryptococcus neoformans, and describe a function for H3K27me recognition in the accurate assembly of this type of heterochromatin. We show that the C. neoformans EZH2 ortholog acts to deposit H3K27me3 in subtelomeric regions, silencing gene expression across large domains. This activity requires a PRC2-like complex whose subunits include orthologs of metazoan PRC2 components as well as a chromodomain protein that binds specifically to H3K27me marks. Disruption of this binding activity reconfigures the genomic landscape of H3K27me3 to one that strikingly coincides with sites of H3K9me2 heterochromatin. Indeed, we find that this redistribution is entirely dependent on the Clr4 histone methyltransferase that deposits H3K9me2. These results indicate that the binding of PRC2 to its product restrains a latent attraction toward signals that emanate from H3K9me2 domains. Chromodomain-mediated recognition of H3K27me thereby limits the commingling of two distinct types of repressive chromatin. As many chromatin-modifying complexes contain product recognition modules, the principle uncovered here may broadly contribute to the fidelity of genome-regulating enzymes that act upon a highly abundant and grossly identical substrate—the nucleosome. PRC2 component orthologs have been identified in protists, filamentous fungi, and algae, and in some cases have been linked to repressive H3K27 methylation (Connolly et al., 2013Connolly L.R.

Because the human fungal pathogen C. neoformans encodes genes for such orthologs (Shaver et al., 2010Shaver S. Casas-Mollano J.A. Cerny R.L. Cerutti H.

However, the amino acid sequence of histone H3 in Cryptococcus contains an insertion of two amino acids following residue 28 as well as flanking substitutions that are not present in other model eukaryotes, precluding the use of commercial antibodies (Figure 1A). We therefore purified specific antibodies from rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against a synthetic H3K27me3 peptide that corresponded to the predicted Cryptococcus sequence (Extended Experimental Procedures). Dot blot analysis demonstrated that the purified antibody does not cross-react with H3K27me2, H3K9me2/3, or unmodified H3K27 peptides (Figure S1A).Figure S1Validation of a Purified Rabbit Antibody for the Detection of C. neoformans H3K27me3, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Specificity of a purified rabbit antibody against C. neoformans H3K27me3.

Because we observed minimal signal in other regions of the genome (Figure S1B), we focused our analysis on subtelomeres by generating metatelomere plots: all 28 chromosome ends were aligned, after which their average H3K27me3 signal was calculated as a function of chromosomal position and normalized to that of a whole-cell extract (WCE) sample (Figure 1C). Subtelomeric H3K27me3 domains have an average size of 41 kb (Table S1). Importantly, these domains are not observed in cells lacking the putative H3K27 methyltransferase Ezh2 (Figures 1B and 1C). Given the conserved role of Polycomb in repressing transcription, we examined the effect of H3K27me3 domains on gene expression in C. neoformans. When grown in rich media, cells lacking Ezh2 show widespread gene derepression, as determined by RNA-seq: 75 transcripts increase in expression >3-fold as compared to wild-type cells, whereas no transcript except that of EZH2 itself decreases >3-fold. Most derepressed loci (71%) are within the 41 kb subtelomeric regions identified by H3K27me3 ChIP-seq, despite the fact that these regions make up only 5% of the genome (Figure 1D). In fact, when all genome-wide sites of H3K27me3 signal are assessed (Figure S1D), most sites lie in subtelomeric regions and no sites greater than 50 kb from a chromosome end are associated with transcript derepression. Thus, the nonsubtelomeric transcripts repressed by Ezh2 are unlikely to be directly regulated by H3K27me3. Our findings indicate that H3K27me3 in C. neoformans depends on the presence of the EZH2 gene product. To test the functional importance of this histone residue, we incorporated a K27A mutation into histone H3, which is encoded by a single-copy gene in C. neoformans. Cells harboring the h3-K27A mutation show subtelomeric transcript derepression as much as 60-fold, as assessed by RT-qPCR analysis of five transcripts identified by RNA-seq to be elevated in ezh2Δ cells (Figure 1E). The phenotype of an h3-K27A ezh2Δ double mutant is indistinguishable from that of each single mutant, suggesting that Ezh2, in its gene silencing role, acts via H3K27. Next, we generated strains that encoded Ezh2 SET domain mutations predicted to eliminate its catalytic activity (Tan et al., 2014Tan J.-Z. Yan Y. Wang X.-X. Jiang Y. Xu H.E. EZH2: biology, disease, and structure-based drug discovery.Acta Pharmacol. Sin. 2014; 35: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). These mutations, which have little (681-689Δ) or no (Y721A) effect on Ezh2 protein levels, recapitulate the high degree of subtelomeric transcript derepression seen in ezh2Δ cells (Figures 1F and 1G). Our results support a model in which Ezh2 deposits broad domains of repressive subtelomeric H3K27me3. The activity of metazoan EZH2 is controlled extensively by inputs from the other PRC2 subunits (O’Meara and Simon, 2012O’Meara M.M. Simon J.A. Inner workings and regulatory inputs that control Polycomb repressive complex 2.Chromosoma. 2012; 121: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar regulatory logic might exist in C. neoformans, we investigated the protein-interaction partners of Ezh2 in this system. We generated cells expressing CBP-2xFLAG-tagged Ezh2 from its normal chromosomal site, then isolated it by tandem affinity purification and identified its copurifying proteins by mass spectrometry. This purification yielded Ezh2 itself as well as four additional proteins, two of which are orthologs of metazoan PRC2 components (Figures 2A, 2B, and see below). We subsequently tagged and affinity-purified each of these four proteins: Eed1, Msl1, Bnd1, and Ccc1 (Figures 2A and 2B). Purifications of these proteins consistently yielded the original five Ezh2-associated proteins, suggesting the existence of a core PRC2-like protein complex (Figure 2C). The other proteins in the interaction network, which associated with only a subset of the core PRC2 components, may represent more loosely associated factors. Alternatively, these proteins may interact with individual PRC2 components in PRC2-independent contexts. The members of the putative PRC2-like complex include orthologs of metazoan PRC2 components as well as additional factors (Figure 2D and Extended Experimental Procedures). Ezh2 is the H3K27 methyltransferase and Eed1 is an ortholog of EED/Esc, a WD40 repeat protein that binds directly to EZH2/E(z) and stimulates EZH2/E(z) activity. Msl1 is a fungal ortholog of RbAp46/48/Nurf55, a WD repeat protein that associates with PRC2 but is not required for EZH2/E(z) activity and has additional roles in other chromatin-modifying complexes. The remaining components of C. neoformans PRC2 are two factors with no clear orthologs in higher eukaryotes: Bnd1, a big protein with no domains; and Ccc1, a protein that contains a chromodomain and a coiled coil region. Like some other single-celled eukaryotes, C. neoformans does not appear to encode an ortholog of the metazoan PRC2 component SUZ12/Su(z)12 in its genome (Shaver et al., 2010Shaver S. Casas-Mollano J.A. Cerny R.L. Cerutti H. Origin of the polycomb repressive complex 2 and gene silencing by an E(z) homolog in the unicellular alga Chlamydomonas.Epigenetics. 2010; 5: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We used a yeast two-hybrid assay in order to assess pairwise interactions between PRC2 components when expressed in S. cerevisiae. We observed that each component interacts with at least one other complex member, supporting the associations identified by tandem affinity purification (Figure S2A and Table S2). These interactions include one between Eed1 and Ezh2, whose metazoan orthologs bind one another directly in PRC2. Furthermore, two PRC2 components—Bnd1 and Ccc1—display self-interaction, raising the possibility of physical interactions that bridge multiple PRC2 complexes. To assess the functional roles of each PRC2 subunit, we generated strains lacking each individual factor and tested their ability to silence Ezh2 target loci. Every knockout strain shows derepression of subtelomeric transcripts, as determined by RT-qPCR (Figure 2E). However, their phenotypes differ quantitatively. Cells lacking Ezh2, Eed1, or Bnd1 display equivalent, maximal phenotypes. In contrast, loss of Ccc1 causes a less severe phenotype in which some Ezh2 targets are fully derepressed and others are only partially derepressed. Msl1 mutants display the most minor phenotype: at all tested loci, this protein is only partially required for silencing, consistent with the relatively minor contribution of its ortholog, RbAp46/48/Nurf55, to PRC2-mediated silencing in mammals (O’Meara and Simon, 2012O’Meara M.M. Simon J.A. Inner workings and regulatory inputs that control Polycomb repressive complex 2.Chromosoma. 2012; 121: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The physical interactions among the PRC2 components, together with the phenotypes of their corresponding knockouts, suggest that they functionally cooperate, with the individual subunits contributing distinct and separable activities in gene silencing. Several lines of evidence suggest that Msl1 and Ccc1 play additional roles independent of PRC2. First, Msl1 and Ccc1 physically associate not only with PRC2 components but also with members of the chromatin assembly factor (CAF) complex and multiple histone deacetylase (HDAC) complexes (Figure 2B). Metazoan Msl1 orthologs are involved in similar interactions (Suganuma et al., 2008Suganuma T. Pattenden S.G. Workman J.L. Diverse functions of WD40 repeat proteins in histone recognition.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1265-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Second, both msl1Δ and ccc1Δ strains exhibit a growth defect, whereas strains lacking any of the other PRC2 components—ezh2Δ, eed1Δ, and bnd1Δ—do not (Table S3). Third, cells lacking Msl1 or Ccc1 demonstrate more widespread gene expression changes than do cells lacking Ezh2, as measured by RNA-seq (Figure 2F). Specifically, Msl1 is required for silencing of approximately half of the Ezh2 target genes, and additionally represses 225 other loci, whereas Ccc1 silences approximately half of the Ezh2 target genes as well as 65 other loci, most of which are coregulated by Msl1. We tested whether the PRC2-independent factors associated with Msl1 and Ccc1 are involved in repressing PRC2 target loci. We were able to generate knockout strains for a subset of these factors, which we tested by RT-qPCR for their ability to silence subtelomeric transcripts. Loss of Cac2 (of the CAF complex) has no effect on subtelomeric transcript levels, nor does loss of Eza1, Nop1, Hat1, or CNAG_04786 (Figure S2B). A strain lacking Rpd3 (of the Rpd3S and Rpd3L HDAC complexes) displays derepression of a subset of subtelomeric loci, but does not phenocopy the PRC2 component gene knockouts. Notably, however, deletion of the gene encoding an ortholog of S. pombe Clr3 leads to a full derepression of subtelomeric genes (Figure S2C), implicating this Class II HDAC ortholog in PRC2 action. Notably, HDAC activity cooperates with PRC2 in metazoan systems, where it removes antagonistic marks such as H3K27 acetylation (Reynolds et al., 2012Reynolds N. Salmon-Divon M. Dvinge H. Hynes-Allen A. Balasooriya G. Leaford D. Behrens A. Bertone P. Hendrich B. NuRD-mediated deacetylation of H3K27 facilitates recruitment of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 to direct gene repression.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 593-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, Tie et al., 2009Tie F. Banerjee R. Stratton C.A. Prasad-Sinha J. Stepanik V. Zlobin A. Diaz M.O. Scacheri P.C. Harte P.J. CBP-mediated acetylation of histone H3 lysine 27 antagonizes Drosophila Polycomb silencing.Development. 2009; 136: 3131-3141Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Together, these data point to the C. neoformans PRC2 as a five-protein functional core complex that mediates H3K27me3-dependent gene silencing and shares structural and functional similarities with the metazoan PRC2. Having determined that PRC2 components play varying roles in subtelomeric gene repression, we investigated their respective functions in the formation of H3K27me3 domains. We used H3K27me3 ChIP-seq to examine a knockout from each phenotypic group: ezh2Δ cells display the maximal transcript derepression phenotype, whereas ccc1Δ and msl1Δ cells represent two partial phenotypes at the Ezh2 target genes, with the msl1Δ phenotype being the more minor of the two. As seen before, ezh2Δ cells lack all detectable H3K27me3 signal (Figures 3A and 3B ). In contrast, and consistent with its minor transcript phenotype, the msl1Δ strain shows only a minor reduction in its subtelomeric H3K27me3 domains: ChIP enrichment is slightly reduced, as is their average size (35 kb versus 41 kb in wild-type, Table S1). Cells lacking Ccc1 have an intermediate phenotype in which subtelomeric H3K27me3 signal is reduced but not eliminated, with small domains (14 kb) still detectable. While these data do not rule out downstream roles for Msl1 and Ccc1, they suggest that these PRC2 components contribute to subtelomeric gene silencing by enabling the formation of appropriately-positioned H3K27me3 domains. Further examination of the ChIP-seq data revealed a remarkable feature of ccc1Δ cells: whereas H3K27me3 signal is reduced at its normal subtelomeric locations, signal is increased at an ectopic site—the centromeres (Figure 3A). Centromeres have not been extensively studied in C. neoformans, but consist largely of transposon-derived repeats and correspond to a single broad region on each chromosome that lacks open reading frames (Janbon et al., 2014Janbon G. Ormerod K.L. Paulet D. Byrnes 3rd, E.J. Yadav V. Chatterjee G. Mullapudi N. Hon C.-C. Billmyre R.B. Brunel F. et al.Analysis of the genome and transcriptome of Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii reveals complex RNA expression and microevolution leading to virulence attenuation.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004261Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). H3K27me3 signal is increased at all 14 centromeres in ccc1Δ cells, and for some centromeres becomes comparable in magnitude to subtelomeric signal on the same chromosome. To systematically examine centromeric H3K27me3, we generated meta-centromere plots: all centromeres were aligned at their midpoints, after which their average H3K27me3 signal was calculated as a function of chromosomal position and normalized to that of a WCE sample (Figure 3C). Our analysis revealed an increase in centromeric H3K27me3 signal in ccc1Δ cells, but not in msl1Δ cells. To quantify the extent of ectopic H3K27me3 deposition, we compared the density of H3K27me3 ChIP-seq signal at its proper sites—subtelomeres—versus centromeres (Figure 3D). As expected, wild-type cells exhibit subtelomeric signal but negligible centromeric signal, whereas msl1Δ cells display diminished subtelomeric signal. In contrast, ccc1Δ cells show not only a reduction in subtelomeric signal, but also a dramatic increase in centromeric signal (Figure 3D). These findings indicate that multiple PRC2 components are required for the proper spatial distribution of H3K27me3, with Ccc1 specifically being required to prevent an ectopic redistribution of this chromatin mark. To determine the mechanism by which Ccc1 enforces the correct genomic localization of H3K27me3, we examined its chromodomain, a protein motif that can bind directly to histone methyl-lysine residues (Eissenberg, 2012Eissenberg J.C. Structural biology of the chromodomain: form and function.Gene. 2012; 496: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). First, we recombinantly expressed a truncated fragment of Ccc1 that contains its chromodomain (Figures 4A and S3A). We then tested its capacity to bind histone modifications by using a peptide array representing 384 different histone modification combinations. We observed binding to only eight peptides on the array (Figure 4B). Strikingly, each peptide contains either a H3K27me2 or H3K27me3 modification, implying that the Ccc1 chromodomain is a specific reader of these PRC2-deposited marks. These results were somewhat surprising because the bound peptides correspond to the human H3 sequence, which differs from the C. neoformans sequence at residues downstream of K27. The downstream residues may therefore be less important for binding, consistent with the fact that the Pc chromodomain binds histone H3 primarily via interactions with residues upstream of H3K27me3 (Min et al., 2003Min J. Zhang Y. Xu R.-M. Structural basis for specific binding of Polycomb chromodomain to histone H3 methylated at Lys 27.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, we confirmed Ccc1 chromodomain binding to the C. neoformans H3K27me2/3 sequence using fluorescence polarization. Chromodomain binding to a fluorescently labeled, human H3K27me3 peptide was competed with increasing amounts of unlabeled Cryptococcus H3K27 peptides (Figure 4C). H3K27me2 and me3 peptides compete with apparent affinities of 119 and 28 μM, respectively, while we observed no competition with the unmodified peptide.Figure S3Recombinant Expression of Ccc1 Chromodomain and In Vivo Effects of Its Mutation, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Coomassie staining of the Ccc1(1-109) fragment after purification from E. coli and resolution by PAGE."

How such different roles of tubulin and FtsZ evolved is unknown. Studying Archaea may provide clues as these organisms share characteristics with Eukarya and Bacteria. Here we report the structure and function of proteins from a distinct family related to tubulin and FtsZ, named CetZ, which co-exists with FtsZ in many archaea. CetZ X-ray crystal structures showed the FtsZ/tubulin superfamily fold, and one crystal form contained sheets of protofilaments, suggesting a structural role. However, inactivation of CetZ proteins in Haloferax volcanii did not affect cell division. Instead, CetZ1 was required for differentiation of the irregular plate-shaped cells into a rod-shaped cell type that was essential for normal swimming motility. CetZ1 formed dynamic cytoskeletal structures in vivo, relating to its capacity to remodel the cell envelope and direct rod formation. CetZ2 was also implicated in H. volcanii cell shape control. Our findings expand the known roles of the FtsZ/tubulin superfamily to include archaeal cell shape dynamics, suggesting that a cytoskeletal role might predate eukaryotic cell evolution, and they support the premise that a major function of the microbial rod shape is to facilitate swimming."
https://openalex.org/W1992820573,"A human tRNA synthetase connects resveratrol to stress signalling. Many reports highlight the health benefits of resveratrol, a natural ingredient of grape skins and red wine. It is thought to extend lifespan and protect against a variety of diseases by initiating a stress response that induces survival genes. Here Mathew Sajish and Paul Schimmel present a 2.1 Å co-crystal structure of resveratrol bound to the active site of human tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (TyrRS), an enzyme that translocates to the nucleus under stress conditions. They see that resveratrol inhibits catalytic activity and redirects TyrRS to a nuclear function, stimulating NAD+-dependent auto-poly-ADP-ribosylation of PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1) and leading to the activation of key stress signalling pathways. This work suggests an alternative mechanism of action for resveratrol, additional to its binding and activation of the histone deacetylase SIRT1. Resveratrol is reported to extend lifespan1,2 and provide cardio-neuro-protective3, anti-diabetic4, and anti-cancer effects3,5 by initiating a stress response2 that induces survival genes. Because human tyrosyl transfer-RNA (tRNA) synthetase (TyrRS) translocates to the nucleus under stress conditions6, we considered the possibility that the tyrosine-like phenolic ring of resveratrol might fit into the active site pocket to effect a nuclear role. Here we present a 2.1 Å co-crystal structure of resveratrol bound to the active site of TyrRS. Resveratrol nullifies the catalytic activity and redirects TyrRS to a nuclear function, stimulating NAD+-dependent auto-poly-ADP-ribosylation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Downstream activation of key stress signalling pathways are causally connected to TyrRS–PARP1–NAD+ collaboration. This collaboration is also demonstrated in the mouse, and is specifically blocked in vivo by a resveratrol-displacing tyrosyl adenylate analogue. In contrast to functionally diverse tRNA synthetase catalytic nulls created by alternative splicing events that ablate active sites7, here a non-spliced TyrRS catalytic null reveals a new PARP1- and NAD+-dependent dimension to the physiological mechanism of resveratrol."

In most cases, reversal of disease would require strategies combining islet cell replacement with immunotherapy that are currently available only for the most severely affected patients. Here, we demonstrate that immunotherapies that target T cell costimulatory pathways block the rejection of xenogeneic human embryonic-stem-cell-derived pancreatic endoderm (hESC-PE) in mice. The therapy allowed for long-term development of hESC-PE into islet-like structures capable of producing human insulin and maintaining normoglycemia. Moreover, short-term costimulation blockade led to robust immune tolerance that could be transferred independently of regulatory T cells. Importantly, costimulation blockade prevented the rejection of allogeneic hESC-PE by human PBMCs in a humanized model in vivo. These results support the clinical development of hESC-derived therapy, combined with tolerogenic treatments, as a sustainable alternative strategy for patients with T1D."

https://openalex.org/W2070846071,"The body of evidence of physiologically relevant P450-P450 interactions in microsomal membranes continues to grow. Here we probe oligomerization of human CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2E1 in microsomal membranes. Using a technique based on luminescence resonance energy transfer, we demonstrate that all three proteins are subject to a concentration-dependent equilibrium between the monomeric and oligomeric states. We also observed the formation of mixed oligomers in CYP3A4/CYP3A5, CYP3A4/CYP2E1, and CYP3A5/CYP2E1 pairs and demonstrated that the association of either CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 with CYP2E1 causes activation of the latter enzyme. Earlier we hypothesized that the intersubunit interface in CYP3A4 oligomers is similar to that observed in the crystallographic dimers of some microsomal drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450 (Davydov, D. R., Davydova, N. Y., Sineva, E. V., Kufareva, I., and Halpert, J. R. (2013) Pivotal role of P450-P450 interactions in CYP3A4 allostery: the case of α-naphthoflavone. Biochem. J. 453, 219–230). Here we report the results of intermolecular cross-linking of CYP3A4 oligomers with thiol-reactive bifunctional reagents as well as the luminescence resonance energy transfer measurements of interprobe distances in the oligomers of labeled CYP3A4 single-cysteine mutants. The results provide compelling support for the physiological relevance of the dimer-specific peripheral ligand-binding site observed in certain CYP3A4 structures. According to our interpretation, these results reveal an important general mechanism that regulates the activity and substrate specificity of the cytochrome P450 ensemble through interactions between multiple P450 species. As a result of P450-P450 cross-talk, the catalytic properties of the cytochrome P450 ensemble cannot be predicted by simple summation of the properties of the individual P450 species.

https://openalex.org/W1971913913,"The activity of membrane proteins such as Na,K-ATPase depends strongly on the surrounding lipid environment. Interactions can be annular, depending on the physical properties of the membrane, or specific with lipids bound in pockets between transmembrane domains. This paper describes three specific lipid-protein interactions using purified recombinant Na,K-ATPase. (a) Thermal stability of the Na,K-ATPase depends crucially on a specific interaction with 18:0/18:1 phosphatidylserine (1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine; SOPS) and cholesterol, which strongly amplifies stabilization. We show here that cholesterol associates with SOPS, FXYD1, and the α subunit between trans-membrane segments αTM8 and -10 to stabilize the protein. (b) Polyunsaturated neutral lipids stimulate Na,K-ATPase turnover by >60%. A screen of the lipid specificity showed that 18:0/20:4 and 18:0/22:6 phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are the optimal phospholipids for this effect. (c) Saturated phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, but not saturated phosphatidylserine or PE, inhibit Na,K-ATPase activity by 70–80%. This effect depends strongly on the presence of cholesterol. Analysis of the Na,K-ATPase activity and E1-E2 conformational transitions reveals the kinetic mechanisms of these effects. Both stimulatory and inhibitory lipids poise the conformational equilibrium toward E2, but their detailed mechanisms of action are different. PE accelerates the rate of E1 → E2P but does not affect E2(2K)ATP → E13NaATP, whereas sphingomyelin inhibits the rate of E2(2K)ATP → E13NaATP, with very little effect on E1 → E2P. We discuss these lipid effects in relation to recent crystal structures of Na,K-ATPase and propose that there are three separate sites for the specific lipid interactions, with potential physiological roles to regulate activity and stability of the pump."

Considering the number of AMPAR at each synapse, the majority of synapses do not contain any phosphorylated AMPAR. Also, we did not see evidence of GluA1 dually phosphorylated at S831 and S845.

The phosphorylation of AMPAR has been proposed to play a critical role in synaptic plasticity (Derkach et al., 2007Derkach V.A. Oh M.C. Guire E.S. Soderling T.R.

The hypothesis involves the phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit GluA1 in a two-step process. Phosphorylation of S845 by PKA is a prerequisite for triggering AMPAR trafficking to the synaptic surface and maintenance during basal transmission (Lee et al., 2000Lee H.K. Barbarosie M. Kameyama K.

Chem. 2006; 281: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Potentiation of synaptic transmission takes place when the receptor is additionally phosphorylated at S831 by CaMKII. This phosphorylation increases the single-channel conductance and contributes to the increased transmission following LTP induction (Benke et al., 1998Benke T.A. Lüthi A. Isaac J.T. Collingridge G.L.

In contrast, LTD is mediated by receptor removal caused by the dephosphorylation of S845-phosphorylated GluA1 at the synaptic surface (Kameyama et al., 1998Kameyama K. Lee H.K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L.

Regulation of distinct AMPA receptor phosphorylation sites during bidirectional synaptic plasticity.Nature. 2000; 405: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Overall, this scheme assumes that a large proportion of the GluA1 mediating synaptic transmission is phosphorylated. If LTP is maintained by phosphorylation of GluA1 at S831 and S845, one should be able to find dually phosphorylated GluA1 at these sites after LTP induction. Likewise, if dephosphorylation triggers removal of surface AMPAR during LTD, the majority of GluA1 maintaining basal transmission should be phosphorylated at S845. Phosphorylation at S818 controls the interaction with band 4.1N, a cytoskeletal anchoring protein, and those at T840 and S567 are also implicated in synaptic plasticity (Boehm et al., 2006Boehm J. Kang M.G. Johnson R.C. Esteban J. Huganir R.L. Malinow R.

USA. 2010; 107: 22266-22271Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Hence, multiple phosphorylation on GluA1 has been suggested to cooperatively participate in the induction and maintenance of synaptic plasticity. However, critical information to attest this scheme, the stoichiometry of GluA1 phosphorylation and the phosphoisotypes (combination of phosphorylated sites) involved, are unknown. Several methods, including phosphospecific antibodies, phosphopeptide mapping, and mass spectrometry, have been used to detect the phosphorylation of specific sites. However, using these approaches, it is difficult to determine the proportion of phosphorylation and the phosphoisotypes. For example, western blotting with a phosphospecific antibody can detect a doubling of phosphorylation. However, it cannot distinguish whether the change is from 0.1% to 0.2% or from 10% to 20%. Also, it is very difficult to determine the phosphoisotype using phosphospecific antibodies. Because of this, although dually phosphorylated GluA1 at S831 and S845 is implicated in LTP, the presence of such receptor molecules has not been demonstrated. Therefore, critical experimental evidence to verify the aforementioned scheme is still lacking. Phos-tag is a compound that associates with phosphate groups on a protein in the presence of divalent cations (Kinoshita et al., 2008Kinoshita E. Kinoshita-Kikuta E. Matsubara M. Yamada S. Nakamura H. Shiro Y. Aoki Y. Okita K. Koike T.

Saito T. Asada A. Fukunaga K. Hisanaga S. Quantitative measurement of in vivo phosphorylation states of Cdk5 activator p35 by Phos-tag SDS-PAGE.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2010; 9: 1133-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When covalently conjugated with polyacrylamide in an SDS-PAGE, it separates phosphorylated from unphosphorylated proteins. Because the extent of separation is dependent on both the number of phosphorylated residues and the surrounding sequence, one can separate distinct phosphoisotypes of a given protein based on mobility. Furthermore, by blotting the gel with an appropriate antibody, one can also determine the stoichiometry of different phosphoisotypes. Using this feature of Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, we quantified GluA1 phosphorylation in both mature and developing hippocampus. We found that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation in adult tissue is much lower than expected from the current plasticity model. We did not find any evidence of GluA1 dually phosphorylated at both S831 and S845. Our results compel us to reevaluate the current model of AMPAR regulation. To test whether Phos-tag SDS-PAGE is applicable for the analysis of GluA1 phosphoisotypes, GluA1 was expressed in HEK293T cells, and phosphorylation was induced by blocking endogenous phosphatase activity with okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein PP1 and 2A. This treatment increased the phosphorylation of various proteins in HEK293T cells (Figure S1A available online), likely by unmasking the basal activity of endogenous kinases. While GluA1 on conventional SDS-PAGE did not show a difference in migration in the presence or absence of OA, it showed multiple bands that migrated slowly only in the presence of OA on Phos-tag SDS-PAGE (Figure 1A). These bands disappeared by treating the cell lysate with λ protein phosphatase (Figure 1B). To test whether the band shift was caused by phosphorylation at a previously identified GluA1 site, we mutated all five known phosphorylation sites to alanine (Figure 1C, 5A). The GluA1 wild-type or 5A mutant was coexpressed with a constitutively active form of CaMKII (phosphorylates GluA1 at S567 and S831), and the cells were further treated with phorbol ester (PKC activator, S818, S831, and T840), forskolin (PKA activator, S845), cyclosporine A (PP2B inhibitor), and OA (Barria et al., 1997Barria A.

Unlike wild-type GluA1, 5A mutants did not show a band shift indicating that there were no other phosphorylation sites under this condition. To identify the phosphorylation sites causing the band shift, we mutated each of the alanine residues back to serine or threonine, while maintaining the other four alanines (4A mutants). S831, T840, and S845 on a 4A background showed a clear band shift, but at different positions. They were confirmed to be GluA1 phosphorylated at respective sites by blotting with phosphoantibodies. In contrast, S567 or S818 on a 4A background did not show a noticeable band shift. Also, an antibody against pS567 (Lu et al., 2010Lu W. Isozaki K. Roche K.W. Nicoll R.A. Synaptic targeting of AMPA receptors is regulated by a CaMKII site in the first intracellular loop of GluA1.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 22266-22271Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) did not detect any phosphorylated proteins, indicating a low phosphorylation stoichiometry (data not shown). As a result, we did not investigate the S567 and S818 phosphorylation sites further and focused on S831, T840, and S845. To test if GluA1 dually phosphorylated at S831 and S845 could be detected, we made a construct that maintained both S831 and S845, but mutated the other three sites to alanine (Figure 1D, 3A 831+845). Blotting with a C terminus antibody detected GluA1 phosphorylated at S831 and S845 as well as unphosphorylated protein. Additionally, we detected a band above S831, which was confirmed to be dually phosphorylated GluA1 in the blots with pS831 and pS845 antibodies. This band was at almost the same location as singly phosphorylated GluA1 at T840. Therefore, for the rest of the study, we routinely reblotted the membrane with phosphospecific antibodies to identify the phosphoisotype of each band. Likewise, both individually and dually phosphorylated GluA1 were detected in S831 and T840 on a 3A background (the T840 band could be visualized using the C terminus antibody, but was too faint in the pT840 blot; Figure 1D). In the T840 and S845 on a 3A background, individually phosphorylated bands, but not dually phosphorylated bands, were detected. In summary, Phos-tag SDS-PAGE in combination with phosphospecific antibodies allows us to detect the phosphoisotypes of singly and dually phosphorylated GluA1. Next we tested if we could use Phos-tag SDS-PAGE to determine the stoichiometry of GluA1 phosphorylation. For this purpose, we first ascertained whether the GluA1 C terminus antibody detects each phosphoisotype with equal efficiency. We maximally phosphorylated GluA1 mutants 5A or S831, T840, and S845 on 4A background and tested the reactivity of the antibody (Figure 1E). Phos-tag SDS-PAGE confirmed that they were ∼100% phosphorylated. In these samples, there were no obvious differences in band intensity between the 5A and phosphorylated mutants, confirming that phosphorylation at S831, T840, and S845 did not affect the reactivity of the C terminus antibody. We therefore assumed that, by comparing the intensity of the bands corresponding to phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GluA1 in the blot with C terminus antibody, we could estimate the stoichiometry of GluA1 phosphorylation using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE. To test this, we compared the result of quantification using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE with that of mass spectrometric absolute quantification (AQUA) (Gerber et al., 2003Gerber S.A. Rush J. Stemman O. Kirschner M.W. Gygi S.P. Absolute quantification of proteins and phosphoproteins from cell lysates by tandem MS.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 6940-6945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar). We immunoprecipitated GluA1 (S831 on 4A background) from HEK293T cells, untreated or treated with OA, and mixed them at different ratios, thereby making a series of GluA1 samples with different stoichiometry of S831 phosphorylation. The stoichiometry of S831-phosphorylated GluA1 in each mixture was determined by western blotting with the C terminus antibody and measuring the band intensity of S831-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GluA1 on the Phos-tag SDS-PAGE (Figure 1F). In parallel, the same samples were subjected to AQUA using a synthetic standard of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides containing 13C and 15N (Figure S1D). The results from these two methods coincide with each other precisely (Figure 1G), indicating that Phos-tag SDS-PAGE is a reliable measure of the stoichiometry of protein phosphorylation. We next determined the amount of phosphorylated GluA1 in adult rat hippocampus. In conventional SDS-PAGE, blotting with antibodies against GluA1 C terminus, pS831, pT840, and pS845 showed bands at the expected molecular weight (Figure 2A, top). As expected, upon phosphatase treatment, the bands disappeared from the blots using phosphoantibodies. Using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, we observed a discrete band shift with pS831, pT840, and pS845 antibodies at similar relative positions as HEK293T cells (Figure 2A, bottom). However, when blotting was performed with the C terminus antibody, < 1% of pS831 and ∼5% of pT840 GluA1 were detected at the corresponding positions, and pS845 was undetectable (Figure 2A, bottom, B and C). The dually phosphorylated GluA1 at S831 and S845 is expected to be at almost the same location as T840-phosphorylated GluA1 (Figure 1D), but, as there was no signal on the pS831 and pS845 blots (Figure 2A), we concluded that the upper band in the blot with C-terminal antibody was composed solely of pT840 GluA1. Likewise, there was no evidence of other multiply phosphorylated GluA1. We also subjected hippocampal GluA1 to AQUA. Consistent with the result of Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, it also showed that pS831 on GluA1 from hippocampal tissue was barely detectable, an amount that was significantly lower than the smallest standard (2.3%) (Figure S1D). Changes in sample preparation method did not change the level of phosphorylation (Figure S2A). Therefore it is unlikely that GluA1 is dephosphorylated during sample preparation. To further extend the dynamic range, we calibrated the immunoblot signal as follows. The 4A mutant samples containing ∼100% phosphorylated receptors (Figure 1E) were serially diluted, separated using conventional SDS-PAGE, and blotted with phosphoantibodies, from which a calibration line was drawn (Figures 2D and 2E). Hippocampal extract, preadjusted so that it contains the same amount of total GluA1 (Figure 2D, bottom), was also separated on the same gel, and the amount of phosphorylated GluA1 at each site was obtained from the calibration line (Figures 2D, top, and 2E). We estimated that 0.18% ± 0.01%, 4.3% ± 0.7%, and 0.018% ± 0.001% of hippocampal GluA1 was phosphorylated at S831, T840, and S845, respectively (Figures 2D and 2E), largely consistent with the measurement of band intensity on Phos-tag SDS-PAGE. One reason why only a small proportion of phosphorylated GluA1 was detected may be because the extract is a mixture of various membranous compartments. We therefore extracted the PSD fraction by detergent treatment, which is enriched with PSD-95, a prominent PSD protein, but lacks synaptophysin, a presynaptic protein (Figure 2F). Phos-tag SDS-PAGE revealed that the phosphorylation of GluA1 was not significantly different from other fractions. We also attempted to isolate surface GluA1 from cultured hippocampal neurons using a surface biotinylation and avidin pull-down (Figure 2G). There was no obvious difference in phosphoisotypes between internal and surface GluA1. We next tested the ontogeny of GluA1 phosphorylation. The GluA1 phosphorylation was highest at P1 (Figures 2H and 2I). This was evident for pS831, which was 36.2 ± 1.3-fold higher at P1 compared with adult tissue. The level gradually diminished during development and reached adult levels by P28. We found that ∼7% and ∼25% of GluA1 is phosphorylated at S831 and T840, respectively, at P1 (Figures S2B and S2C). In addition, ∼2.5% of GluA1 was dually phosphorylated at both S831 and T840. However, the level of S845-phosphorylated GluA1 was still low, as indicated by the lack of a band detected by the N terminus antibody at the corresponding position in the pS845. We also analyzed other postsynaptic proteins in the hippocampus (Figure S2D). We found that a significant proportion of GluN2B was phosphorylated at tyrosine sites in both P1 and adult hippocampal tissue, though we did not attempt to determine the exact site. Almost all stargazin in adult PSD fraction was phosphorylated, consistent with an earlier study (Sumioka et al., 2010Sumioka A. Yan D. Tomita S. TARP phosphorylation regulates synaptic AMPA receptors through lipid bilayers.Neuron. 2010; 66: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A minor population of PSD-95 was phosphorylated in adult tissue, possibly at S73 or S295 (Kim et al., 2007Kim M.J. Futai K. Jo J. Hayashi Y. Cho K. Sheng M.

Likewise, a minor population of cofilin was phosphorylated at S3 both in P1 and adult tissue. These data demonstrate the versatility of Phos-tag SDS-PAGE in estimating the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of various proteins. We next attempted to test if the level of GluA1 phosphorylation changes by stimulating neurons. We induced chemical LTP (chemLTP) in dissociated neuronal cultures by applying a saturating concentration of glycine (Lu et al., 2001Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces membrane insertion of new AMPA receptors and LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Following the stimulation, the levels of surface GluA1 were increased by 1.43 ± 0.12-fold (Figures 3A and 3B) as reported (Lu et al., 2001Lu W. Man H. Ju W. Trimble W.S. MacDonald J.F. Wang Y.T. Activation of synaptic NMDA receptors induces membrane insertion of new AMPA receptors and LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons.Neuron. 2001; 29: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, pS831 and pS845 GluA1 on the cell surface increased significantly beyond the increase in total surface GluA1, indicating a net increase in the proportion of phosphorylated GluA1 (Figures 3A–3C). However, the proportion of phosphorylated cell surface GluA1 still remained low, from 0.16% ± 0.02% before stimulation to 0.25% ± 0.02% after chemLTP induction at S831, and from 0.012% ± 0.001% to 0.047% ± 0.002% at S845 (Figures 3D–3F). The low amount of phosphorylated GluA1 may be due to rapid dephosphorylation. We therefore treated the cells with phosphatase inhibitors. Treatment of unstimulated neurons led to a significant increase in phosphorylated receptors (Figures 3A, 3C, 3D, and S3A). This was mostly due to pT840, which increased by 19.1 ± 7.3-fold of basal levels and reached ∼80% of the total GluA1, indicating that T840 is undergoing a constant phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle during basal states (Figures 3A, 3C, 3D, and S3). pS831 increased by 7.54 ± 0.81-fold and pS845 by 2.54 ± 0.31-fold (Figures 3A, 3C, and S3B), but they still only account for a small proportion (Figure S3C). Also, treatment with the phosphatase inhibitor itself did not increase surface GluA1 levels (Figures 3A and 3B). When phosphatase inhibitors were combined with glycine, it increased the surface GluA1 by 2.31 ± 0.25-fold, while the increase was only 1.43 ± 0.12-fold with glycine alone (Figures 3A and 3B). However, the effect on phosphorylation of cell surface GluA1 was still small. pS831 and pT840 did not increase further, and S845 marginally increased (Figures 3C and 3D). In summary, T840 undergoes cycles of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation under basal conditions, with endogenous phosphatase activity maintaining phosphorylation at low levels. In contrast, the kinase activity to phosphorylate S831 and S845 is intrinsically low, at both basal states and during chemLTP induction, and it is not phosphatase activity that maintains low levels of phosphorylation. To examine GluA1 phosphorylation in vivo, PSD fractions of hippocampal tissue from rats that underwent inhibitory avoidance learning were analyzed. This paradigm induces a rapid and persistent potentiation of hippocampal synaptic transmission both in vitro and in vivo (Whitlock et al., 2006Whitlock J.R. Heynen A.J. Shuler M.G. Bear M.F.

A cholinergic trigger drives learning-induced plasticity at hippocampal synapses.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We found a 2.5-fold increase in AMPA/NMDA ratio, a 33% increase in miniature EPSC amplitude, and a 54% increase in frequency in randomly sampled cells compared with tissue from control animals, indicating that a significant proportion of synapses undergo potentiation with this paradigm. We prepared PSD fractions from rats before, 5 min after, and 30 min after training, when an increase in transmission was observed. The training induced an increase in pS831 and pS845 GluA1 in the PSD fraction, consistent with earlier studies (Whitlock et al., 2006Whitlock J.R. Heynen A.J. Shuler M.G. Bear M.F.

USA. 2011; 108: 12503-12508Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), but not in pT840 (Figures 4A and 4B). However, when compared with the total levels of GluA1 in the PSD fraction, the amount of phosphorylated GluA1 at these sites was still low (Figures 4C–4E). It was 0.21% ± 0.02% under basal conditions and 0.33% ± 0.01% 30 min after learning for S831 and 0.023% ± 0.004% and 0.044% ± 0.004% for S845. The stoichiometry of phosphorylation and phosphoisotypes of GluA1, two critical pieces of information to attest the importance of AMPAR phosphorylation in synaptic plasticity, have been overlooked so far, in part due to the lack of an appropriate method to obtain such information. Using Phos-tag SDS-PAGE, we found that the amount of phosphorylated GluA1 was very low. In naive hippocampal tissue, 0.18% and 0.018% of GluA1 was phosphorylated at S831 and S845, respectively. If we assume that there are 100 GluA1 molecules on each synapse (Tanaka et al., 2005Tanaka J. Matsuzaki M. Tarusawa E. Momiyama A. Molnar E. Kasai H. Shigemoto R.

Hence, the majority of GluA1 at synapses are not phosphorylated, and the rest of the synapses do not contain any phosphorylated GluA1. We also saw no evidence of dually phosphorylated GluA1 at S831 and S845. In light of these results, the current model of plasticity, which assumes AMPAR phosphorylation plays a significant role, needs to be reevaluated. First, it is difficult to explain how LTP maintenance is linked with an increase in phosphorylation. GluA1 phosphorylation at S831 increases channel conductance only by ∼2-fold (Derkach et al., 1999Derkach V. Barria A. Soderling T.R. Ca2+/calmodulin-kinase II enhances channel conductance of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate type glutamate receptors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 3269-3274Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Such an effect would be diluted by unphosphorylated AMPARs, which make up the majority of the AMPAR population. One possibility is that transient phosphorylation might be sufficient to induce LTP. However, we ruled out this possibility by treatment with a phosphatase inhibitor, which only marginally increased S831 and S845 phosphorylation upon glycine treatment. Similarly, the majority of synapses do not contain even a single S845-phosphorylated GluA1. This observation rules out the possibility that LTD is mediated by dephosphorylation of synaptic GluA1. Our estimation is in contrast with Oh et al., 2006Oh M.C. Derkach V.A. Guire E.S. Soderling T.R. Extrasynaptic membrane trafficking regulated by GluR1 serine 845 phosphorylation primes AMPA receptors for long-term potentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 752-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar who found that ∼15% of surface AMPARs were phosphorylated at S845 during basal conditions and increased to ∼60% following chemLTP. They used a GST-fusion protein of GluA1 C terminus, phosphorylated to ∼100%, as a standard. However, they introduced a P842R mutation to make it an efficient substrate of PKA. This manipulation may change the antigenicity of the fusion protein to the pS845 antibody and cause inaccuracy. Also, quantification of pS845 with the incorporation of 32P may be compromised by possible phosphorylation at other sites, for example, T840. Finally, to induce chemLTP, they used forskolin/rolipram, which stimulates PKA, whereas we stimulated NMDA receptors with glycine. T840 was the only site whereby a significant proportion of GluA1 was phosphorylated. However, glycine treatment only slightly increased pT840 GluA1 (1.27 ± 0.17-fold, statistically insignificant), and inhibitory avoidance training did not affect pT840 level. Even though we saw an ∼20-fold increase in pT840 level after treatment with a phosphatase inhibitor, it still did not change the amount of cell surface GluA1. Also, T840A knock-in animals, with S838A, S839A, and additional S831A/S845A mutations, did not show any further phenotype compared with S831A/S845A knock-in (Lee et al., 2007Lee H.K. Takamiya K. Kameyama K. He K. Yu S. Rossetti L. Wilen D. Huganir R.L. Identification and characterization of a novel phosphorylation site on the GluR1 subunit of AMPA receptors.Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2007; 36: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Therefore, the functional significance of this phosphorylation requires further study. The impairment of synaptic plasticity in the S831A/S845A knock-in mutant GluA1 mice is generally accepted as strong evidence supporting the requirement of receptor phosphorylation (Lee et al., 2003Lee H.K. Takamiya K. Han J.S. Man H. Kim C.H. Rumbaugh G. Yu S. Ding L. He C.

Studies using exogenous mutant receptors support this view (Esteban et al., 2003Esteban J.A. Shi S.H. Wilson C. Nuriya M. Huganir R.L. Malinow R.

Driving AMPA receptors into synapses by LTP and CaMKII: requirement for GluR1 and PDZ domain interaction.Science. 2000; 287: 2262-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). We indeed observed a significant increase in phosphorylation at S831 and S845 along with an increase in the surface GluA1 as a result of chemLTP or learning (Figures 3 and 4). Therefore, we need to find alternative interpretations for the role of GluA1 phosphorylation. First, phosphorylation in a small proportion of GluA1 may be sufficient to trigger changes in the population of unphosphorylated AMPAR. Alternatively, GluA1 phosphorylation may be important for normal synaptic development, when the GluA1 phosphorylation levels were high (Figure 2H) (Li et al., 2003Li A.J. Suzuki M. Suzuki S. Ikemoto M. Imamura T. Differential phosphorylation at serine sites in glutamate receptor-1 within neonatal rat hippocampus.Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 341: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Impairment of the process may later manifest as an impairment in synaptic plasticity. Finally, these residues may be required for other protein interactions or forms of posttranslational modification. Recently, it was proposed that LTP does not require the carboxyl-tail of AMPA receptor. GluA1 lacking carboxyl-tail containing these phosphorylation sites or GluA2 with a carboxyl-tail of distinct amino acid sequence can replace wild type GluA1 (Granger et al., 2013Granger A.J. Shi Y.

Fatal incidents with Mitragynine have been associated with cardiac arrest. In this study, we determined the cardiotoxicity of Mitragynine and other chemical constituents isolated using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).The rapid delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr), L-type Ca2+ current (ICa,L) and action potential duration (APD) were measured by whole cell patch-clamp. The expression of KCNH2 and cytotoxicity was determined by real-time PCR and Caspase activity measurements. After significant IKr suppression by Mitragynine (10 µM) was confirmed in hERG-HEK cells, we systematically examined the effects of Mitragynine and other chemical constituents in hiPSC-CMs. Mitragynine, Paynantheine, Speciogynine and Speciociliatine, dosage-dependently (0.1∼100 µM) suppressed IKr in hiPSC-CMs by 67%∼84% with IC50 ranged from 0.91 to 2.47 µM. Moreover, Mitragynine (10 µM) significantly prolonged APD at 50 and 90% repolarization (APD50 and APD90) (439.0±11.6 vs. 585.2±45.5 ms and 536.0±22.6 vs. 705.9±46.1 ms, respectively) and induced arrhythmia, without altering the L-type Ca2+ current. Neither the expression, and intracellular distribution of KCNH2/Kv11.1, nor the Caspase 3 activity were significantly affected by Mitragynine.Our study indicates that Mitragynine and its analogues may potentiate Torsade de Pointes through inhibition of IKr in human cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2122704575,"Cytochrome P450 (P450) 17A enzymes play a critical role in the oxidation of the steroids progesterone (Prog) and pregnenolone (Preg) to glucocorticoids and androgens. In mammals, a single enzyme, P450 17A1, catalyzes both 17α-hydroxylation and a subsequent 17α,20-lyase reaction with both Prog and Preg. Teleost fish contain two 17A P450s; zebrafish P450 17A1 catalyzes both 17α-hydroxylation and lyase reactions with Prog and Preg, and P450 17A2 is more efficient in pregnenolone 17α-hydroxylation but does not catalyze the lyase reaction, even in the presence of cytochrome b5. P450 17A2 binds all substrates and products, although more loosely than P450 17A1. Pulse-chase and kinetic spectral experiments and modeling established that the two-step P450 17A1 Prog oxidation is more distributive than the Preg reaction, i.e. 17α-OH product dissociates more prior to the lyase step. The drug orteronel selectively blocked the lyase reaction of P450 17A1 but only in the case of Prog. X-ray crystal structures of zebrafish P450 17A1 and 17A2 were obtained with the ligand abiraterone and with Prog for P450 17A2. Comparison of the two fish P450 17A-abiraterone structures with human P450 17A1 (DeVore, N. M., and Scott, E. E. (2013) Nature 482, 116–119) showed only a few differences near the active site, despite only ∼50% identity among the three proteins. The P450 17A2 structure differed in four residues near the heme periphery. These residues may allow the proposed alternative ferric peroxide mechanism for the lyase reaction, or residues removed from the active site may allow conformations that lead to the lyase activity. Background: Fish (and human) P450 17A1 catalyze both steroid 17α-hydroxylation and 17α,20-lyase reactions. A second fish P450, 17A2 (51% identical), catalyzes only 17α-hydroxylation. Results: Crystal structures of zebrafish P450 17A1 and 17A2 and human P450 17A1 are very similar. Conclusion: In kinetic analysis, the two-step oxidation of progesterone is more distributive than for pregnenolone. Significance: Small structural differences are associated with activities of the two fish P450s."
https://openalex.org/W2028933308,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health problem. Ergone has been proved to prevent the progression of CKD. UPLC-QTOF/HDMS was employed for metabolic profiling of adenine-induced CKD and to investigate the nephroprotective effects of ergone. Pharmacology parameters including blood biochemistry, histopathological evaluation and Western blot analysis were performed concurrently. The UPLC-MS data were analyzed by partial least squares-discriminate analysis, correlation analysis, heatmap analysis and mapped to KEGG pathways. Blood and serum biochemistry were observed to be significantly different in the CKD group than in the control group. In conjunction with biochemistry, histopathology and protein expression results, identified metabolites indicated perturbations in fatty acid metabolism, purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism as changes associated with adenine-induced CKD and the interventions of ergone. Upregulated expression of TGF-β1, ED-1, CTGF, bFGF and collagen I was observed in the CKD group. However, downregulated expression of these proteins was observed after oral administration of ergone. These results suggest that expression changes in these proteins had implications for fatty acid metabolism, purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism in the development of CKD and that ergone treatment could delay the development of CKD by normalizing or blocking abnormal changes in biomarker metabolites and protein expression in the CKD group."

Enzymes from this subfamily were recently shown to use a histidine residue within a His-Asp dyad contained in a signature sequence as their catalytic acid/base residue. Reasons for their use of His rather than the Glu or Asp found in other glycosidases were not apparent. Through studies on a representative member, the Nag3 β-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Cellulomonas fimi, we now show that these enzymes act preferentially as glycoside phosphorylases. Their need to accommodate an anionic nucleophile within the enzyme active site explains why histidine is used as an acid/base catalyst in place of the anionic glutamate seen in other GH3 family members. Kinetic and mechanistic studies reveal that these enzymes also employ a double-displacement mechanism involving a covalent glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, which was directly detected by mass spectrometry. Phosphate has no effect on the rates of formation of the glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, but it accelerates turnover of the N-acetylglucosaminyl-enzyme intermediate ∼3-fold, while accelerating turnover of the glucosyl-enzyme intermediate several hundredfold.

The glycoside hydrolases from CAZy family GH3 display an unusual diversity in structure, specificity, and biological role and are widely distributed in bacteria, fungi, and plants (see the CAZypedia website for a particularly informative discussion on GH3). This sequence-defined family contains β-glucosidases, N-acetylglucosaminidases (often called NagZs), β-xylosidases, and α-arabinofuranosidases. The principal initially identified role of GH3 glycosidases was in biomass degradation, but other roles in pathogen defense and plant and bacterial cell wall remodeling have become apparent. A subset of these enzymes plays a role in the recycling of peptidoglycan by removing the nonreducing end N-acetylglucosamine from the disaccharide product released by lytic transglycosylases and muramidases (GlcNAc-anhydro-MurNAc 3The abbreviations used are: GlcNAc-MurNAcN-acetyl-4-O-[2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl]-muramic acidpNPGlcNAcp-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidepNPGlcp-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranosideDNPGlc2,4-dinitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranosideDNP2FGlc2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucopyranoside2,4DNP2,4-dinitrophenylpNPp-nitrophenyl.-peptide and its hydrated version) in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively (1.Reith J.

This contrasts sharply with the β-hexosaminidases from CAZy family GH20, which lack an enzymatic nucleophile and instead use the acetamide of the substrate in that role, forming an oxazoline or oxazolinium ion intermediate (14.Drouillard S.

GH20 hexosaminidases also differ from those of GH3 in having both N-acetylglucosaminidase and N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity, whereas no N-acetylgalactosaminidase activity is seen in GH3 enzymes. Although the catalytic nucleophile is fully conserved within the GH3 enzymes, such is not the case for the acid/base catalyst. In some two-domain enzymes, such as that from barley (9.Varghese J.N.

By contrast, most of the GH3 N-acetylglucosaminidases are single domain enzymes for which, until recently, neither sequence alignments nor structures suggested an obvious candidate for the acid/base catalyst. However, the structure of NagZ from the Gram-positive organism Bacillus subtilis identified a histidine residue on a flexible loop, in conjunction with a nearby aspartic acid, as a candidate for this role (7.Litzinger S. Fischer S. Polzer P. Diederichs K. Welte W. Mayer C. Structural and kinetic analysis of Bacillus subtilis N-acetylglucosaminidase reveals a unique Asp-His dyad mechanism.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 35675-35684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Importantly the loop containing this Asp-His dyad was highly conserved and indeed had been identified previously as a signature sequence for N-acetylglucosaminidases within GH3 and is proposed to play a role in binding of the acetamide moiety (10.Vocadlo D.J.

This proposal of a histidine as the acid/base was somewhat surprising because in essentially all other glycosidases this role has been played by a glutamate or aspartate, presumably in large part to generate a more anionic environment upon proton transfer that will help stabilize the oxocarbenium ion-like transition state (16.Zechel D.L.

This substitution was attributed to the fact that the substrates themselves bear a negative charge; thus replacement of an anionic side chain with a neutral residue minimizes Coulombic repulsion. In the case of GH33 and GH34 sialidases, the substrate has a carboxylate group at C-1 and the catalytic nucleophile is a tyrosine residue, whereas in GH1 myrosinases the acid/base glutamate is replaced by glutamine to accommodate the anionic aglycone of the substrate (19.Burmeister W.P.

One suggestion was that this would allow turnover of N-acetyl-4-O-[2-(acetylamino)-2-deoxy-β-d-glucopyranosyl]-muramic acid substrates from which the peptide chain has been hydrolyzed, because these bear an anionic lactyl moiety that could be involved in substrate-assisted catalysis (7.Litzinger S.

Further consideration on possible reasons for this Asp-His substitution brought us to the idea that perhaps the negative charge being accommodated was not in the carbohydrate substrate but in the attacking species. The most probable such anionic nucleophile in a cellular environment would be phosphate. If so, then perhaps these enzymes function preferentially as glycoside phosphorylases rather than as glycoside hydrolases. Glycoside phosphorylases are categorized in both GT and GH families within CAZy (22.Lairson L.L. Withers S.G. Mechanistic analogies amongst carbohydrate modifying enzymes.Chem. Commun. 2004; 20: 2243-2248Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The only GT-based phosphorylases to date are the α-retaining glycogen phosphorylases (GT35) and trehalose phosphorylases (GT4). Most other phosphorylases are inverting enzymes with major families being the β-inverting cellobiose/cellodextrin and chitobiose phosphorylases (GH94) and the α-inverting GH65 phosphorylases such as maltose phosphorylase, along with a few others in GH112 and GH130 (22.Lairson L.L.

Interestingly, no retaining β-glycoside phosphorylases have been reported to date. Therefore, should these GH3 hexosaminidases prove to function as phosphorylases through an analogous retaining mechanism to that of the GH3 hydrolases, they would represent a new category of phosphorylases. Substrates used in this study were either purchased from suppliers or donated by members of this laboratory. p-Nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminide (pNPGlcNAc) was purchased from Calbiochem; p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (pNPGlc) was purchased from Sigma. 2,4-Dinitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (DNPGlc) and 2,4-dinitrophenyl 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-d-glucopyranoside (DNP2FGlc) were generously donated by H. Chen and F. Liu, respectively. Concentration/removal of Nag3 was done using Amicon® Ultra-0.5-ml centrifugal filters (Mr 30,000) (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). TLC was done using TLC Silica Gel 60 F254 TLC plates (EMD Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). TLC stain composition was as follows: anisaldehyde reagent (92.5% ethanol, 4% H2SO4, 1.5% acetic acid, 2% p-anisaldehyde), and molybdate reagent (2.5% w/v ammonium molybdate, 1% w/v ceric ammonium sulfate, and 10% H2SO4). Cellulomonas fimi Nag3 was expressed and purified, as reported previously (8.Mayer C. Vocadlo D.J. Mah M. Rupitz K. Stoll D. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. Characterization of a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and a β-N-acetylglucosaminidase/β-glucosidase from Cellulomonas fimi.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2929-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), substituting HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgSO4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT) where sodium phosphate buffer was previously used. The enzymatic reaction rates with the chromogenic substrates were determined by monitoring the change in absorbance at 400 nm. Kinetic measurements were performed in matched 1-cm path length quartz cuvettes using a Varian Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer with an automatic cell changer and temperature controller at 25 °C in HEPES buffer. Reactions contained potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, where specified. Hydrolysis/phosphorolysis rates were calculated by measuring absorbance changes as a function of time and converting these to concentration with the following extinction coefficients: 7280 m−1 cm−1 (pNP) and 12,460 m−1 cm−1 (2,4DNP) at 25 °C, pH 7.0. Nonlinear regression was performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.0 or GraFit. The pre-steady state phase of DNPGlc binding to Nag3 was captured by performing the experiment in a spectrophotometer cuvette cooled to 12 °C and continuously monitoring absorbance at 400 nm. An assay buffer containing HEPES buffer and DNPGlc was preincubated in a quartz cuvette at 12 °C. Once the baseline was established, 40 μl of Nag3 (20 mg/ml) was added to 160 μl of assay buffer to give final concentrations of 4 mg/ml Nag3 (66 μm) and 250 μm DNPGlc. At 0.5 min, after steady state was observed, phosphate was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. 10 mm substrate (pNPGlcNAc, pNPGlc, or DNPGlc) was incubated with 6 mg/ml Nag3 and 0, 5, 25 or 100 mm phosphate in HEPES buffer (with no glycerol) for 2 h (500-μl reaction volume). The incubation temperature was increased to 37 °C (compared with 25 °C used for kinetic assays) to help maximize substrate turnover. After the incubation time, Nag3 was removed with Amicon centrifugal filters, and the filtrate was freeze-dried using a SpeedVac (Savant SV 100) concentrator and dissolved in D2O (500 μl). 1H spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz Avance with inverse probehead. 16 scans employing presaturation water suppression (Bruker standard pulse program “zgcppr”) were recorded per sample. β-Sugar 1-phosphates were prepared by combining 10 mm pNPGlc or pNPGlcNAc with 1 mg/ml Nag3 and 50 mm phosphate in HEPES buffer (10-ml reaction volume). After incubation for 4 h at 25 °C, the samples were freeze-dried using a SpeedVac (Savant SV 100) concentrator. To remove the HEPES buffer, the dried sample was dissolved in H2O and the pH was adjusted to 5. A short column was filled with Dowex 50WX8 ion exchange resin (5 g), and the resin was washed with deionized water (100 ml). The sample was applied, and fractions of 10 ml were taken that were immediately neutralized (NaOH) after collection. The collected fractions were concentrated (Speedvac), pooled, and applied in H2O (∼500 μl) to a Biogel P2 column (60 × 1.5 cm, eluent, H2O, flow rate 0.5 ml/min, fraction size 3.5 ml). Positive fractions were identified by TLC, pooled, concentrated (Speedvac), and analyzed by NMR. Spectra were recorded in D2O and referenced externally to dioxane in D2O (1H, 3.75 ppm and 13C, 67.4 ppm) or H3PO4 in D2O (31P, 0 ppm).

The reaction mixtures were placed on ice before being spotted on silica TLC plates. The plates were eluted with a mobile phase of 1-butanol, methanol, ammonium hydroxide, and water in a 5:4:4:1 ratio, respectively. Once dried, the pNPGlcNAc plate was stained with anisaldehyde reagent, and the pNPGlc and DNPGlc plates were stained with molybdate reagent and heated until the product signals became visible. Anisaldehyde reagent was used for the pNPGlcNAc plate to better visualize GlcNAc formation. 1 mg/ml Nag3 (in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2% glycerol, 5 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm DTT) was incubated with 1 mm DNPGlc or 1 mm DNPGlc and 50 mm phosphate for 1 h at room temperature (50-μl reaction volume). Samples were analyzed using methods described previously (10.Vocadlo D.J. Mayer C. He S. Withers S.G. Mechanism of action and identification of Asp242 as the catalytic nucleophile of Vibrio furnisii N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase using 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-5-fluoro-α-l-idopyranosyl fluoride.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 27.Vocadlo D.J. Withers S.G. Identification of active site residues in glycosidases by use of tandem mass spectrometry.Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 146: 203-222PubMed Google Scholar). Nag3 was inactivated by incubating 2 mg/ml active enzyme with 75 mm of the inactivator DNP2FGlc at 25 °C for 5 h in HEPES buffer (50 μl). Excess DNP2FGlc was diluted to ∼2 μm by dilution with HEPES buffer and re-concentrating with Amicon centrifugal filters. Reactivation was monitored by incubating samples of the inactive Nag3–2FGlc complex, (0.2 mg/ml) in HEPES buffer with 0, 10, 25, 50, 100, or 200 mm phosphate at 25 °C (50 μl reaction volume) and transferring 5-μl aliquots at the indicated time points from the reactivation reaction to an assay solution (195 ml) containing HEPES buffer, 0.5 mm DNPGlc, and 20 mm phosphate. Turnover rates were calculated as described above. The enzyme chosen to test this hypothesis was the GH3 β-glucosaminidase Nag3 from C. fimi, which our laboratory had characterized previously, and was shown to have dual β-glucosaminidase/β-glucosidase activity and to share the conserved β-glucosaminidase signature sequence containing the Asp-His dyad noted earlier (8.Mayer C. Vocadlo D.J. Mah M. Rupitz K. Stoll D. Warren R.A. Withers S.G.

All our previous studies were performed in phosphate buffer, so unwittingly phosphorolysis had been monitored rather than hydrolysis. Nag3 was expressed and purified as described previously (8.Mayer C. Vocadlo D.J. Mah M. Rupitz K. Stoll D. Warren R.A. Withers S.G. Characterization of a β-N-acetylhexosaminidase and a β-N-acetylglucosaminidase/β-glucosidase from Cellulomonas fimi.FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2929-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and exchanged into 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0. It was then assayed at fixed concentrations of three different glycoside substrates at each of a series of phosphate concentrations. Two glucoside substrates of quite different aglycone leaving group ability (pNP, pKa = 7, and 2,4DNP, pKa = 4) were chosen, along with one glucosaminide bearing the same pNP leaving group. As seen in Fig. 1, a strong dependence of rate on phosphate concentrations was observed, with rates increasing rapidly with rising phosphate at low concentrations and inhibition being seen at higher concentrations. This is particularly true for the glucoside substrates, where rate increases of over 100-fold are seen for aryl glucosides upon addition of phosphate. Rates of pNPGlcNAc cleavage in the absence of phosphate were comparable with those for pNPGlc, but the activity increases seen upon phosphate addition to pNPGlcNAc were much more modest. To ensure that these effects have their origins in phosphate acting as a co-substrate and not simply as an allosteric activator, the reactions were monitored by TLC and NMR, and the products were thereby identified. As can be seen in Fig. 2, reaction of all three substrates in the presence of increasing phosphate concentrations results in a change in the product formed from the free sugar (glucose or N-acetylglucosamine) to a product with a very similar TLC mobility to that of α-glucose 1-phosphate. This finding is consistent with the enzyme acting as a glycoside phosphorylase within or indeed below the physiologically relevant phosphate concentration range (20–30 mm) (28.Bennett B.D. Kimball E.H. Gao M. Osterhout R. Van Dien S.J. Rabinowitz J.D. Absolute metabolite concentrations and implied enzyme active site occupancy in Escherichia coli.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 593-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). Confirmation of the formation of a sugar 1-phosphate in each case and determination of the anomeric stereochemistry of that sugar phosphate was achieved by isolating the sugar phosphate and analyzing it by mass spectrometry and NMR. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the products are the β-anomers as follows: β-glucose 1-phosphate and β-N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate, with anomeric stereochemistries being confirmed by the large J1,2 couplings of 7.9 and 8.3 Hz seen for Glc-1-P and GlcNAc-1-P, respectively. These results therefore confirm that Nag3 functions as a phosphorylase in each case and furthermore that it is a β-retaining phosphorylase, the first such enzyme identified. Indeed, not only is this the first reported example of a retaining β-glycoside phosphorylase, but also, to our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of β-GlcNAc-1-phosphate itself in a biochemical system.

Surprisingly, however, no coherent picture has emerged regarding the magnitude, duration and cellular distribution of inducible Hsps in the visual system following injury to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). The current study sought, therefore, to achieve the following two objectives. The first aim of this study was to systematically characterise the patterns of Hsp27 and −70 expression in the retina and optic nerve in four discrete models of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration: axonal injury (ON crush), somato-dendritic injury (NMDA-induced excitotoxicity), chronic hypoperfusion (bilateral occlusion of the carotid arteris) and experimental glaucoma. The second aim was to document Hsp27 and −70 expression in the optic tract, the subcortical retinorecipient areas of the brain, and the visual cortex during Wallerian degeneration of RGC axons. Hsp27 was robustly upregulated in the retina in each injury paradigm, with the chronic models, 2VO and experimental glaucoma, displaying a more persistent Hsp27 transcriptional response than the acute models. Hsp27 expression was always associated with astrocytes and with a subset of RGCs in each of the models excluding NMDA. Hsp27 was present within astrocytes of the optic nerve/optic tract in control rats. During Wallerian degeneration, Hsp27 was upregulated in the optic nerve/optic tract and expressed de novo by astrocytes in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the stratum opticum of the superior colliculus. Conversely, the results of our study indicate Hsp70 was minimally induced in any of the models of injury, either in the retina, or in the optic nerve/optic tract, or in the subcortical, retinorecipient areas of the brain. The findings of the present study augment our understanding of the involvement of Hsp27 and Hsp70 in the response of the visual system to RGC degeneration."

We have previously shown that the IL-34 is primarily produced by neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and induces proliferation and neuroprotective properties of microglia which express CSF1R. However, the functions of IL-34 in the CNS are still elucidative. Here we show that CNS capillary endothelial cells also express CSF1R. IL-34 protected blood–brain barrier integrity by restored expression levels of tight junction proteins, which were downregulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines. The novel function of IL-34 on the blood–brain barrier may give us a clue for new therapeutic strategies in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease."

https://openalex.org/W2044115181,"Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) plays an essential role in the epigenetic repression of gene expression during development and cellular differentiation via multiple effector mechanisms, including ubiquitination of H2A and chromatin compaction. However, whether it regulates the stepwise progression of adipogenesis is unknown. Here, we show that FBXL10/KDM2B is an anti-adipogenic factor that is up-regulated during the early phase of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation and in adipose tissue in a diet-induced model of obesity. Interestingly, inhibition of adipogenesis does not require the JmjC demethylase domain of FBXL10, but it does require the F-box and leucine-rich repeat domains, which we show recruit a noncanonical polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) containing RING1B, SKP1, PCGF1, and BCOR. Knockdown of either RING1B or SKP1 prevented FBXL10-mediated repression of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation indicating that PRC1 formation mediates the inhibitory effect of FBXL10 on adipogenesis. Using ChIP-seq, we show that FBXL10 recruits RING1B to key specific genomic loci surrounding the key cell cycle and the adipogenic genes Cdk1, Uhrf1, Pparg1, and Pparg2 to repress adipogenesis. These results suggest that FBXL10 represses adipogenesis by targeting a noncanonical PRC1 complex to repress key genes (e.g. Pparg) that control conversion of pluripotent cells into the adipogenic lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2071944151,"Tuber magnatum produces the world's most expensive truffle. This fungus produces very rare ectomycorrhizas which are difficult or even impossible to detect in the field. A “real-time” PCR assay was recently developed to quantify and to track T. magnatum mycelium in soil. Here, this technique was used to investigate the spatial distribution of T. magnatum extra-radical mycelium in soil productive patches and its dynamic across seasons. This study was carried out in four different natural T. magnatum truffle grounds located in different Italian regions. During the fruiting seasons, the amount of T. magnatum mycelium was significantly higher around the fruiting points and decreased going farther away from them. Moreover, T. magnatum mycelium inside the productive patches underwent seasonal fluctuations. In early spring, the amount of T. magnatum mycelium was significantly higher than in summer. In summer, probably due to the hot and dry season, T. magnatum mycelium significantly decreased, whereas in autumn it increased again and was concentrated at the putative fruiting points. These results give new insights on T. magnatum ecology and are useful to plan the most appropriate sampling strategy for evaluating the management of a truffle ground."
https://openalex.org/W2003630693,"Transcription factor Forkhead box protein M1b (FoxM1b) plays an important role during mitotic entry and progression. Our previous studies identified polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as a major regulator of FoxM1b. During G2/M transition, PLK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates FoxM1b, resulting in full activation of the transactivation capacity of FoxM1b. Such a vital regulatory mechanism is essential for timely mitotic entry and progression. However, the molecular mechanism by which PLK1-mediated phosphorylation enhances the transcriptional activity of FoxM1b remains to be determined. We demonstrate that FoxM1b can be SUMOylated in vitro and in vivo, preferentially by SUMO-1. SUMOylation of FoxM1b was found to occur at multiple sites, leading to suppression of FoxM1b transcriptional activity. Such a posttranslational modification of FoxM1b was antagonized by PLK1-mediated phosphorylation. By immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation, we demonstrate that SUMO conjugation promotes cytosolic translocation of FoxM1b. Moreover, SUMO modification of FoxM1b facilitates the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of FoxM1b. PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxM1b abrogates the inhibitory effect on FoxM1b by SUMO modification, thereby promoting its nuclear translocation and preventing its proteolytic degradation in the cytoplasm. Such an antagonistic regulatory mechanism is essential for the mitotic function of FoxM1b, ensuring timely mitotic entry and progression. Taken together, our studies have revealed a working mechanism by which PLK1 positively regulates the activity and level of FoxM1b, which would greatly facilitate therapeutic interventions that focus on targeting the PLK1-mediated and/or FoxM1-mediated signaling network.Background: PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxM1b leads to full activation of FoxM1b.Results: FoxM1b SUMOylation leads to suppression of FoxM1b activity, which is abrogated by PLK1-mediated phosphorylation.Conclusion: PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxM1b antagonizes its SUMOylation and, thereby, facilitates its mitotic function.Significance: Elucidating the PLK1-mediated regulation of FoxM1b would greatly facilitate targeted therapeutic interventions. Transcription factor Forkhead box protein M1b (FoxM1b) plays an important role during mitotic entry and progression. Our previous studies identified polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) as a major regulator of FoxM1b. During G2/M transition, PLK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates FoxM1b, resulting in full activation of the transactivation capacity of FoxM1b. Such a vital regulatory mechanism is essential for timely mitotic entry and progression. However, the molecular mechanism by which PLK1-mediated phosphorylation enhances the transcriptional activity of FoxM1b remains to be determined. We demonstrate that FoxM1b can be SUMOylated in vitro and in vivo, preferentially by SUMO-1. SUMOylation of FoxM1b was found to occur at multiple sites, leading to suppression of FoxM1b transcriptional activity. Such a posttranslational modification of FoxM1b was antagonized by PLK1-mediated phosphorylation. By immunofluorescence staining and subcellular fractionation, we demonstrate that SUMO conjugation promotes cytosolic translocation of FoxM1b. Moreover, SUMO modification of FoxM1b facilitates the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of FoxM1b. PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxM1b abrogates the inhibitory effect on FoxM1b by SUMO modification, thereby promoting its nuclear translocation and preventing its proteolytic degradation in the cytoplasm. Such an antagonistic regulatory mechanism is essential for the mitotic function of FoxM1b, ensuring timely mitotic entry and progression. Taken together, our studies have revealed a working mechanism by which PLK1 positively regulates the activity and level of FoxM1b, which would greatly facilitate therapeutic interventions that focus on targeting the PLK1-mediated and/or FoxM1-mediated signaling network. Background: PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxM1b leads to full activation of FoxM1b. Results: FoxM1b SUMOylation leads to suppression of FoxM1b activity, which is abrogated by PLK1-mediated phosphorylation. Conclusion: PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxM1b antagonizes its SUMOylation and, thereby, facilitates its mitotic function. Significance: Elucidating the PLK1-mediated regulation of FoxM1b would greatly facilitate targeted therapeutic interventions. Forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) is in the Fox family of transcription factors whose members have a conserved forkhead DNA-binding domain (1Clark K.L. Halay E.D. Lai E. Burley S.K. Co-crystal structure of the HNF-3/fork head DNA-recognition motif resembles histone H5.Nature. 1993; 364: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). FoxM1 is important for cell differentiation, proliferation, cellular transformation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and metastasis (2Laoukili J. Stahl M. Medema R.H. FoxM1: at the crossroads of ageing and cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 92-102PubMed Google Scholar). As a key mitotic player, FoxM1 regulates mitotic entry and progression by controlling the expression of a cluster of G2/M target genes, including Cyclin B1, Cdc25B, Survivin, CENPA, and Aurora B (3Costa R.H. FoxM1 dances with mitosis.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 108-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 4Wang I.C. Chen Y.J. Hughes D. Petrovic V. Major M.L. Park H.J. Tan Y. Ackerson T. Costa R.H.

Loss of the forkhead transcription factor FoxM1 causes centrosome amplification and mitotic catastrophe.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). FoxM1-null mice die during embryogenesis because of the development of polyploid cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes. FoxM1-deficient (−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts display chromosomal instability and polyploidy, leading to cell death. Abnormal activation of FoxM1 is a hallmark of many human cancers (6Pilarsky C. Wenzig M. Specht T. Saeger H.D. Grützmann R. Identification and validation of commonly overexpressed genes in solid tumors by comparison of microarray data.Neoplasia. 2004; 6: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). FoxM1 expression increases with tumor grade and is inversely correlated with patient survival (2Laoukili J. Stahl M. Medema R.H. FoxM1: at the crossroads of ageing and cancer.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 92-102PubMed Google Scholar). FoxM1 overexpression promotes anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in nude mice (7Park H.J. Wang Z. Costa R.H. Tyner A. Lau L.F. Raychaudhuri P. An N-terminal inhibitory domain modulates activity of FoxM1 during cell cycle.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1696-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), indicating that it contributes to cellular transformation and tumorigenicity. The human FoxM1 gene is mapped to chromosome 12p13-3, which consists of ten exons, two of which (exons A1 and A2) are spliced differentially, giving rise to three distinct isoforms (splice variants): FoxM1a, FoxM1b, and FoxM1c (8Korver W.

Dissecting temporal and spatial control of cytokinesis with a myosin II inhibitor.Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). FoxM1a has been found to be transcriptionally inactive because of the disruption of the transactivation domain by exon A2. Its physiological function has not been investigated (10Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Dissecting temporal and spatial control of cytokinesis with a myosin II inhibitor.Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). In contrast, most studies to date have focused on FoxM1b (containing neither the A1 nor the A2 exon) and FoxM1c (harboring only exon A1) (8Korver W. Roose J. Clevers H. The winged-helix transcription factor Trident is expressed in cycling cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J.

These two isoforms are transcriptionally active and can directly transactivate target gene expression in an isoform-specific manner (11Wierstra I. Alves J.

Chem. 2007; 388: 805-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The functional difference and interrelationship among the three human FoxM1 isoforms remain to be determined. FoxM1 is a typical proliferation-associated transcription factor (14Wierstra I. Alves J. FOXM1, a typical proliferation-associated transcription factor.Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). It is ubiquitously expressed in proliferating cells and is barely detectable in quiescent, senescent, or terminally differentiated cells (8Korver W. Roose J. Clevers H. The winged-helix transcription factor Trident is expressed in cycling cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15Leung T.W. Lin S.S. Tsang A.C. Tong C.S. Ching J.C. Leung W.Y. Gimlich R. Wong G.G. Yao K.M. Over-expression of FoxM1 stimulates cyclin B1 expression.FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both the expression level and transcriptional activity of FoxM1 vary throughout the cell cycle. They are low in G0 and G1 phases, begin to rise at the onset of S phase, and peak at G2/M phase (8Korver W. Roose J. Clevers H. The winged-helix transcription factor Trident is expressed in cycling cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1715-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), which correlates positively with the critical roles of FoxM1 in proliferation and mitosis. As a key transcription factor that mediates diverse cellular processes, FoxM1 is under highly coordinated and multilayered regulation. It has been shown that not only mRNA and protein expression of FoxM1 but also its transcriptional activity are positively and negatively regulated by proliferation and antiproliferation signals, respectively (14Wierstra I. Alves J. FOXM1, a typical proliferation-associated transcription factor.Biol. Chem. 2007; 388: 1257-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modifications play an important role in the regulation of FoxM1. For instance, phosphorylation of FoxM1 by Raf-MEK-ERK is responsible for its nuclear translocation in late S phase (16Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Forkhead box M1B transcriptional activity requires binding of Cdk-cyclin complexes for phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of p300/CBP coactivators.Mol. Cell.

Cancer. 2007; 7: 847-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). Hyperphosphorylation during G2/M phase correlates with increased transcriptional activity of FoxM1, suggesting that phosphorylation plays an important regulatory role in fully activating this protein during the late phases of the cell cycle (16Major M.L. Lepe R. Costa R.H. Forkhead box M1B transcriptional activity requires binding of Cdk-cyclin complexes for phosphorylation-dependent recruitment of p300/CBP coactivators.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2649-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we previously identified FoxM1b as a novel PLK1-interacting protein (18Fu Z. Malureanu L. Huang J. Wang W. Li H. van Deursen J.M. Tindall D.J. Chen J. Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of FoxM1 regulates a transcriptional programme required for mitotic progression.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). During G2/M transition, PLK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates FoxM1b, activating its transcriptional activity (18Fu Z. Malureanu L. Huang J. Wang W. Li H. van Deursen J.M. Tindall D.J. Chen J. Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of FoxM1 regulates a transcriptional programme required for mitotic progression.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). PLK1-mediated FoxM1b regulation controls a large array of G2/M target genes that are required for timely mitotic entry and progression (18Fu Z. Malureanu L. Huang J. Wang W. Li H. van Deursen J.M. Tindall D.J. Chen J. Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of FoxM1 regulates a transcriptional programme required for mitotic progression.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This study provides the working mechanisms of how FoxM1 is activated in the later phases of the cell cycle and how it contributes to G2/M progression. Moreover, these important findings establish a novel link between PLK1 and a key mitotic transcription factor, FoxM1b, thereby providing some clues as to how PLK1 globally regulates cell division. However, the precise mechanism by which PLK1-mediated phosphorylation enhances the transcriptional activity FoxM1 remains to be determined. In this study, we investigated how PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxM1b results in increased transcriptional activity of FoxM1b. We show that PLK1-dependent phosphorylation antagonizes the SUMO 3The abbreviations used are: SUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifierTDconstitutively activeKDkinase-defectivePMLpromyelocytic leukemia protein. modification of FoxM1b, thereby leading to its nuclear retention and protection from proteasomal degradation during G2/M progression.

Bohmann (University of Rochester Medical School). Plasmids for amino acid substitution mutants of pA3M-Myc-FoxM1b-6KR (Lys-201, Lys-218, Lys-341, Lys-445, Lys-463, and Lys-480 were converted to Arg) and pA3M-Myc-FoxM1b-AA/6KR were generated by PCR-based mutagenesis (Stratagene). cDNA encoding SUMO-1 was amplified by PCR and subcloned in-frame to the 5′ end of the WT FoxM1b cDNA to generate pA3M-Myc-SUMO-1-FoxM1b. The sequences of primers were as follows: forward, aaaaaccggtatgtctgaccaggaggccaaa; reverse, aaaaaccggtagatccagacattcccatccccgtttgttcctgataaac. Lentivirus-based plasmids expressing shRNA to target FoxM1b (pLOK.1-FoxM1b), mimosine, thymidine, aphidicolin, blebbistatin, nocodazole, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. HeLa, HeLa S3, and 293T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. U2OS cells were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. HeLa cells stably expressing hexahistidine-tagged SUMO-1 were provided by R. T. Ray (University of Dundee). Transient transfection of U2OS, HeLa, and 293T cells was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer. To establish stable U2OS-derived cell lines, transfected cells were diluted and grown in media containing 800 μg/ml G418 for 14 days. Individual clones were then selected and maintained in media containing 400 μg/ml G418. For G1 phase arrest, cells were treated with 0.5 mm mimosine for 24 h. For S phase arrest, cells were treated with 4 mm hydroxyurea for 40 h. For G2/M arrest, cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h. To synchronize HeLa and U2OS cells at the G1/S boundary, cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 18 h, released for 10 h, and then treated with 2 μg/ml aphidicolin for 18 h. It was a challenge to synchronize cells at anaphase and telophase because of the short duration of anaphase. Because the non-muscle myosin II ATPase motor provides the force for furrow ingression, treatment with the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin leads to cytokinesis failure (10Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J.

The following protocol has been reported previously to successfully enrich cell populations in different stages of the mitosis and was used in this study (19Matsui Y. Nakayama Y. Okamoto M.

HeLa S3 cells were treated with 4 mm thymidine for 24 h, released into thymidine-free medium for 9 h, and then incubated with nocodazole for 4 h. Prometaphase cells were collected by mitotic shakeoff. These cells were washed to remove nocodazole and released in nocodazole-free medium for 20 min to enrich metaphase cells. Subsequently, the cells were incubated in the presence of 50 μm blebbistatin for 20 and 50 min to enrich cells in anaphase and telophase, respectively. The antibodies used in this study were as follows: anti-Cyclin B1 (1:1000), anti-FoxM1 (1:200), and anti-Myc (1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-SUMO-1 (1:1000, University of Iowa); anti-Aurora B (1:250) and anti-Cdc25B (1:250) (BD Biosciences); anti-Ubiquitin (1:1000, Upstate); anti-Lamin A/C (Cell Signaling Technology); and anti-FLAG (1:5000), anti-β-actin (1:5000), anti-α-tubulin (1:5000), and anti-SUMO-2/3 (1:1000) (Sigma). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing the phosphorylated serine 715 (anti-p715) of FoxM1b have been described previously (18Fu Z. Malureanu L. Huang J. Wang W. Li H. van Deursen J.M. Tindall D.J.

Cells were lysed in NETN lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 8), 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors for 20 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation or coimmunoprecipitation experiments, cleared lysates (1–2 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the indicated polyclonal antibodies and protein A-Sepharose for 1 h. Proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P membranes, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PEFA 1023 (pH 7.9), and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and then centrifuged for 10 s at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected as cytoplasmic extracts. The pellets were washed twice with hypotonic buffer and lysed with high-salt buffer (450 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20% glycerol, 2 mm DTT, and 1% Nonidet P-40). Cell lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts. Equal amounts of protein from cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were then analyzed by Western blotting. U2OS and HeLa cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Luciferase activity was determined 24 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase levels were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. The promoter activity resulting from transfection with FoxM1b WT was set at 100%, and relative luciferase activity is shown. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed for 15 min with 3% paraformaldehyde solution and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After washing with PBS three times, the slides were incubated with primary antibodies for 20 min at 37 °C, and then fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 20 min at 37 °C. All antibodies were diluted in 5% goat serum. Cells were counterstained with DAPI dye (EMD Millipore) for 30 s. GST-FoxM1b was expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21 strain as reported previously (18Fu Z. Malureanu L. Huang J. Wang W. Li H. van Deursen J.M. Tindall D.J. Chen J. Plk1-dependent phosphorylation of FoxM1 regulates a transcriptional programme required for mitotic progression.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1076-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The SUMOylation reaction was carried out using an in vitro SUMOylation kit from Active Motif according to the instructions of the manufacturer. After termination with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, reaction products were separated on SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-SUMO-1 and anti-FoxM1 antibody. Cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol for at least 1 h. Cells were washed twice in PBS and treated for 30 min at 37 °C with RNase A at 5 μg/ml and propidium iodide at 50 μg/ml. The cells were then analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The percentage of cells in different cell cycle phases was calculated using ModFit LT for Mac (BD Biosciences). Total RNA extraction and real-time PCR analysis were performed as described previously (20Yuan C. Bu Y. Wang C. Yi F. Yang Z. Huang X. Cheng L. Liu G. Wang Y. Song F. NFBD1/MDC1 is a protein of oncogenic potential in human cervical cancer.Mol. Cell Biochem. 2012; 359: 333-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cells expressing FoxM1b WT or a FoxM1b mutant using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Two-step real-time PCR was performed using cDNA prepared from RNA using a Superscript III first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) and a SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 7900 instrument following the instructions of the manufacturer. The thermal cycling conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and then 60 °C for 1 min. The -fold change in expression levels (using GAPDH as an internal control) was determined by a comparative Ct method using the formula 2−ΔΔCt, where Ct is the threshold cycle of amplification. The sequences of PCR primers were as follows: cyclin B1, ttggtgtcactgccatgttt (forward) and ccgacccagaccaaagttta (reverse); Aurora B, accctttgagagtgcatcac (forward) and gagcagtttggagatgaggtc (reverse); PLK1, tgatggcagccgtgaccta (forward) and ggcggtatgtgcggaagt (reverse); and GAPDH, acctgacctgccgtctagaa (forward) and tccaccaccctgttgctgta (reverse). All experiments were performed at least three times in triplicates for each group. The results are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test, and the level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Because SUMOylation has emerged as an important mechanism for transcriptional control, we first examined whether FoxM1b is subject to SUMO modification. Interestingly, we found a series of bands migrating slower than FoxM1b. These bands were recognized by an anti-Myc antibody in cells expressing Myc-tagged FoxM1b and SUMO-1 or SUMO-2/3, suggestive of SUMO modification, as well as multiple SUMO acceptor sites (Fig. 1A). Consistently, these higher molecular weight FoxM1b species reacted with anti-SUMO-1 and anti-SUMO-2/3 antibodies, confirming their identity (Fig. 1A). Notably, FoxM1b was preferentially SUMOylated by SUMO-1 compared with SUMO-2/3 (Fig. 1A). An in vitro SUMOylation assay verified that FoxM1b can be multi-SUMOylated by WT SUMO-1 but not a SUMO-1 mutant that has deletion of the two C-terminal glycine residues required for its conjugation to target proteins (Fig. 1B). Importantly, we also immunoprecipitated SUMOylated endogenous FoxM1b in cells under denaturing conditions, further confirming the covalent conjugation of FoxM1b with SUMO-1 (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results indicate that FoxM1b is subject to SUMO modification. We next used the SUMOplotTM analysis program to search for potential SUMO acceptor sites and identified six SUMOylation consensus motifs, ψKXE (ψ denotes a hydrophobic amino acid and X denotes any amino acid) (21Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. SUMO-1 conjugation in vivo requires both a consensus modification motif and nuclear targeting.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar), on FoxM1b. They are located at positions 201, 218, 341, 445, 463, and 480. None of these are within the DNA-binding domain or transactivation domain (Fig. 1D). We subsequently used site-directed mutagenesis to mutate these six lysine residues to arginine, individually or in combination, to create FoxM1b-KR mutants that fail to be SUMOylated at specific sites. Only mutation of all six Lys residues to Arg (6KR) abolished SUMOylation (Fig. 1E and data not shown), indicating that all six sites are SUMO-1 acceptor sites. The phosphorylation of some proteins affects their SUMOylation, usually negatively (22Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. SUMO-1 modification of IκBα inhibits NF-κB activation.Mol.

To determine the interplay between phosphorylation (mediated by PLK1) and SUMOylation of FoxM1b, we transfected U2OS cells with either FLAG-tagged WT, TD, or KD PLK1 and examined their effects on SUMO conjugation to FoxM1b. WT or TD PLK1 significantly decreased SUMOylation of FoxM1b, but KD PLK1 increased its SUMOylation (Fig. 2A), suggesting that PLK1 activity, directly or indirectly, modulates FoxM1b SUMOylation. To investigate whether PLK1-mediated phosphorylation of FoxM1b interferes with SUMOylation of FoxM1b, we transfected U2OS cells with SUMO-1 along with either Myc-tagged WT, a phosphomimetic mutant (EE), or an unphosphorylatable mutant (AA) of FoxM1b. The FoxM1b-EE mutant showed dramatically decreased SUMO modification compared with WT FoxM1b, whereas the FoxM1b-AA mutant showed the opposite (Fig. 2B). This suggests that PLK1-dependent phosphorylation of FoxM1b interferes with the SUMOylation of FoxM1b. To further demonstrate that PLK1 is directly involved in this process, bacterially expressed FoxM1b was subjected to an in vitro kinase assay using PLK1 as a kinase source, followed by an in vitro SUMOylation assay. PLK1-directed phosphorylation was confirmed by Western blot analysis with an anti-phospho-specific Ser(P)-724-FoxM1b antibody (Ser-724 on FoxM1b is a major PLK1 phosphorylation site (18Fu Z. Mal"

Here, we report the characterization of wild type MDR3 and the Q1174E mutant, which was identified previously in a patient with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC-3). We expressed different variants of MDR3 in the yeast Pichia pastoris, purified the proteins via tandem affinity chromatography, and determined MDR3-specific ATPase activity in the presence or absence of phospholipids. The ATPase activity of wild type MDR3 was stimulated 2-fold by liver PC or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylethanolamine lipids. Furthermore, the cross-linking of MDR3 with a thiol-reactive fluorophore blocked ATP hydrolysis and exhibited no PC stimulation. Similarly, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and sphingomyelin lipids did not induce an increase of wild type MDR3 ATPase activity. The phosphate analogues beryllium fluoride and aluminum fluoride led to complete inhibition of ATPase activity, whereas orthovanadate inhibited exclusively the PC-stimulated ATPase activity of MDR3. The Q1174E mutation is located in the nucleotide-binding domain in direct proximity of the leucine of the ABC signature motif and extended the X loop, which is found in ABC exporters. Our data on the Q1174E mutant demonstrated basal ATPase activity, but PC lipids were incapable of stimulating ATPase activity highlighting the role of the extended X loop in the cross-talk of the nucleotide-binding domain and the transmembrane domain.

These mice showed a complete absence of PLs from bile. The function of Mdr2 could be substituted in these mice by expressing the human MDR3 gene, indicating that MDR3 acts as a PL floppase (3.Smith A.J. de Vree J.M. Ottenhoff R. Oude Elferink R.P.

Further studies used the lower hydrophobicity of short chain lipids (C5-C6 chain) to determine Mdr2/MDR3-mediated lipid translocation in yeast and cultured mammalian cells, respectively.

As of yet, no specific ATPase activity of MDR3 could be determined when the protein was expressed at high levels in insect (Sf9) cells or HEK293 cells, although MDR1 exhibited high ATPase activity in these systems (16.Smith A.J. van Helvoort A. van Meer G.

They demonstrated that the purified chimera protein exhibited 10-fold lower drug-stimulated ATPase activity compared with MDR1. These findings confirmed that the NBDs of MDR3 bind ATP but that ATP hydrolysis takes place with an apparent low turnover number. Previously, we demonstrated that human wild type MDR3 exhibited PC-induced ATPase activity, whereas the ATPase-deficient mutant of both Walker B motifs did not show stimulation (18.Ellinger P. Kluth M. Stindt J. Smits S.H. Schmitt L.

In this study, we characterized the ATPase activity of wild type MDR3 in terms of kinetic parameters, substrate spectrum, and the effect of phosphate analogues. Furthermore, we analyzed the ATPase activity of the MDR3 Q1174E mutant in vitro, which was identified in a patient with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC-3) and described previously in Kubitz et al.

Each ATP-binding site harbors highly conserved motifs, the Walker A (GXXGXGK(S/T), where X can be any amino acid residue), and the Walker B motif (ΦΦΦΦD, where Φ can be any hydrophobic residue) of one NBD, and the ABC signature motif (C loop, LSGGQ) of the opposing NBD (23.Schmitt L. Tampé R. Structure and mechanism of ABC transporters.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). A highly conserved motif, the X loop (TEVGERG), which is located in close proximity to the ABC signature motif, was identified by Dawson and Locher (22.Dawson R.J. Locher K.P.

The X loop contacts the first intracellular loop (ICL1) of the TMD and likely transmits conformational changes generated by ATP binding and hydrolysis to the TMD (22.Dawson R.J. Locher K.P.

To date, the molecular function of this transmission interface with respect to coupling of the ATP hydrolysis cycle with substrate translocation is still not entirely clear. We expressed the Q1174E mutant in Pichia pastoris and purified the mutant via tandem affinity purification (TAP). The detergent-solubilized Q1174E mutant exhibited basal ATPase activity, which was demonstrated by modifying this mutant with a thiol-reactive fluorophore, but no substrate-stimulated ATPase activity in contrast to the wild type floppase. Thus, we suggest that glutamine 1174 is involved in the cross-talk of NBD and TMD. Fos-choline 16 (FC-16) was obtained from Anatrace, and lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other chemicals were from Sigma. The protein concentration was determined by a Bradford assay using the Coomassie Plus Assay (Pierce). The Mini-Protean 3 system (Bio-Rad) was used for SDS-PAGE on 7% gels. Immunoblotting was performed with a Tank blot system (Bio-Rad) using the monoclonal anti-P-gp C219 antibody (Merck) employing standard procedures. We cloned human wild type MDR3 (NM_000443.3) as described previously (18.Ellinger P. Kluth M. Stindt J. Smits S.H. Schmitt L.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with the QuikChange® XL (Agilent Technologies) and the Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (Thermo Scientific), respectively. To generate the ATPase-deficient mutant, we exchanged Glu-558 and Glu-1207 of the conserved Walker B motif against Gln with the primer pair as described before (18.Ellinger P. Kluth M. Stindt J. Smits S.H. Schmitt L.

The Q1174E mutant was introduced into MDR3 with the Phusion site-directed mutagenesis kit (Thermo Scientific) using forward primer 5′-GATAAGGGGACTGAGCTCTCAGGAGGTCAAAAAC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCCACTCTTGTTTCATATTTGTGGGGTAACG-3′. The sequences of all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (GATC Biotech). MDR3 expression constructs were transformed into electro-competent P. pastoris X33 cells (Invitrogen) using standard procedures, and the expression level was analyzed as described in Ellinger et al. (18.Ellinger P. Kluth M. Stindt J. Smits S.H. Schmitt L.

For large-scale expression, P. pastoris cells containing the chromosomally integrated wild type MDR3, the E558Q/E1702Q double mutant, or the Q1174E mutant gene were fermented in a 15-liter table-top glass fermenter (Applikon Biotechnology) according to the P. pastoris fermentation guidelines from Invitrogen. Usually, a volume of 7 liters of basal salt media was inoculated with 1 liter of an overnight culture grown in MGY (1.34% yeast nitrogen base, 1% glycerol, and 4 × 10−5% biotin) media. During the glycerol-fed batch phase, ∼500 ml of 50% (v/v) glycerol added with 12 ml/liter PTM1 salts was fed for 4 h. Protein expression was induced by addition of 3.6 ml/h/liter of methanol for 48 h. During the complete fermentation, the temperature was set at 30 °C; oxygenation was kept above 20% O2 saturation, and the mixer was set at 1000 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further use. Under these conditions, 1.4 kg of wet cell mass were routinely obtained. Generally, 100 g of frozen P. pastoris cells expressing the respective MDR3 protein (wild type or mutant) were thawed on ice, washed with 500 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and resuspended at a concentration of 0.5 g of cells/ml in homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.33 m sucrose, 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 1 mm DTT) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Cells were disrupted by two passages through a pre-cooled TS Series Cell Disrupter (Constant Systems) at 2.7 kbar. After cell debris was removed by three centrifugation steps (10 min at 5000 × g, 4 °C, and two times for 30 min at 15,000 × g, 4 °C), crude membrane vesicles were prepared by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 125,000 × g at 4 °C. Membrane vesicles were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 30% (v/v), glycerol) and flash-frozen in liquid N2. The purification of wild type MDR3 or mutant was performed as described previously with a few modifications (18.Ellinger P. Kluth M. Stindt J. Smits S.H. Schmitt L. Detergent screening and purification of the human liver ABC transporters BSEP (ABCB11) and MDR3 (ABCB4) expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e60620Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Crude membrane vesicles equivalent to 100 g of wet cells were diluted to a final concentration of 15 mg/ml total protein with buffer A and solubilized with 1% (w/v) of FC-16 for 1 h at 4 °C. Nonsolubilized membrane vesicles were removed by centrifugation at 125,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. All buffers typically contained 2× critical micelle concentration of FC-16 (0.0011% (w/v) FC-16) and were cooled to 4 °C. The supernatant supplemented with 20 mm imidazole was loaded onto a Ni2+-loaded HiTrap chelating column (5 ml, GE Healthcare) and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A supplemented with 20 mm imidazole. Proteins were eluted in one step with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 200 mm imidazole, 20% (v/v) glycerol). The immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography eluate was diluted five times with CaCl2 binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, and 20% (v/v) glycerol), applied to 4 ml of calmodulin affinity resin equilibrated in CaCl2 binding buffer and incubated with the calmodulin resin overnight at 4 °C on a rotator. The resin was transferred into a gravity flow column and washed with 10 column volumes of CaCl2 binding buffer. Protein was eluted with 5 column volumes of EGTA elution buffer (2 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 20% (v/v) glycerol). The purified protein was directly used for ATPase activity measurements or aliquoted, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Aliquots of the samples were analyzed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Purified wild type MDR3 and mutants were incubated with 10-fold molar excess of BODIPY® FL maleimide (BODIPY® FL N-(2-aminoethyl))maleimide, Molecular Probes) at room temperature for 20 min. BODIPY®FL maleimide was added from a stock solution prepared in DMSO. The concentration of DMSO in the mixture did not exceed 0.2% (v/v). The reaction was terminated by the addition of a 20-fold molar excess of dithiothreitol, and samples were stored on ice until ATPase activity measurements. The labeling was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorescence imaging at 488 nm excitation and 520 nm emission wavelength. The ATPase activity of MDR3 was examined with the malachite green assay by determination of released free inorganic orthophosphate as described previously with a few changes in the experimental procedures (18.Ellinger P.

Reactions were performed in a total volume of 100 μl in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (at 37 °C), containing 2× critical micelle concentration of FC-16 and 10 mm MgCl2. 5–10 μg of purified detergent-solubilized MDR3 proteins were used, and the reaction was started by adding 2 mm ATP at 37 °C and stopped after 0 and 40 min by the addition of 25 μl of the reaction mixture into 175 μl of 20 mm ice-cold H2SO4. Subsequently, 50 μl of dye solution (0.096% (w/v) malachite green, 1.48% (w/v) ammonium molybdate, and 0.173% (w/v) Tween 20 in 2.36 m H2SO4) was added. After 15 min, the amount of free phosphate was quantified by measuring the absorption at 595 nm. For substrate-stimulated ATPase activity, purified MDR3 was incubated at room temperature for 20 min with a defined volume taken from a 5 mm lipid stock solution and sonicated for 30 s to facilitate the incorporation of lipids into the detergent-protein micelles. The lipid-protein sample was directly used for ATPase activity measurement. For determination of kinetic parameters, ATP concentration was varied. The kinetic data were analyzed according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics as shown in Equation 1,v=vmax[S]KM+[S](Eq-1) Here, v describes the reaction velocity; vmax is the maximal reaction velocity; S the substrate concentration, and Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant. Inhibition by phosphate analogues was assayed with stock solutions containing 100 mm BeCl2 complemented with 500 mm NaF (100 mm BeFx) and 100 mm AlCl3 complemented with 500 mm NaF (100 mm AlFx), respectively. Orthovanadate solutions (100 and 10 mm) were prepared from Na3VO4 at pH 10 and boiled for 2 min prior to use (28.Gordon J.A. Use of vanadate as protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). To determine the IC50 values, the ATPase activity was plotted against the log of inhibitor concentration. The data were analyzed according to Equation 2,y=ymin+ymax−ymin1+10((log IC50−x)⋅slope)(Eq-2) Here, ymax denotes the ATPase activity in the starting plateau, and ymin denotes the ATPase activity of the final inhibited plateau. y describes the ATPase activity value, and x represents the logarithmic concentration of the inhibitor. The IC50 value is calculated as the value of the inhibitor concentration used at an ATPase activity inhibition of 50%. This corresponds to the inflection point of the resulting curves. For subsequent data evaluation, a reaction with EDTA (final concentration of 20 mm) was performed, and the autohydrolysis of ATP was subtracted. For calibration of free phosphate concentrations, a Na2HPO4 standard curve was used. All experiments were generally performed three times if not otherwise stated. Fitting was carried out using the GraphPad Prism Software (version 5.0a). Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy were performed as described recently (29.Kubitz R. Sütfels G. Kühlkamp T.

Although peripheral B cell disturbances have been described in SS, with predominance of naïve and reduction of memory B cells, the stage at which errors in B cell tolerance checkpoints accumulate in SS is unknown. Here we determined the frequency of self- and poly-reactive B cells in the circulating naïve and memory compartment of SS patients. Single CD27−IgD+ naïve, CD27+IgD+ memory unswitched and CD27+IgD− memory switched B cells were sorted by FACS from the peripheral blood of 7 SS patients. To detect the frequency of polyreactive and autoreactive clones, paired Ig VH and VL genes were amplified, cloned and expressed as recombinant monoclonal antibodies (rmAbs) displaying identical specificity of the original B cells. IgVH and VL gene usage and immunoreactivity of SS rmAbs were compared with those obtained from healthy donors (HD). From a total of 353 VH and 293 VL individual sequences, we obtained 114 rmAbs from circulating naïve (n = 66) and memory (n = 48) B cells of SS patients. Analysis of the Ig V gene repertoire did not show significant differences in SS vs. HD B cells. In SS patients, circulating naïve B cells (with germline VH and VL genes) displayed a significant accumulation of clones autoreactive against Hep-2 cells compared to HD (43.1% vs. 25%). Moreover, we demonstrated a progressive increase in the frequency of circulating anti-nuclear naïve (9.3%), memory unswitched (22.2%) and memory switched (27.3%) B cells in SS patients. Overall, these data provide novel evidence supporting the existence of both early and late defects in B cell tolerance checkpoints in patients with SS resulting in the accumulation of autoreactive naïve and memory B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1974674847,"Objective Understanding healthy brain development in utero is crucial in order to detect abnormal developmental trajectories due to developmental disorders. However, in most studies neuroimaging was done after a significant postnatal period, and in those studies that performed neuroimaging on fetuses, the quality of data has been affected due to complications of scanning during pregnancy. To understand healthy brain development between 37–41 weeks of gestational age, our study assessed the in utero growth of the brain in healthy term born babies with DTI scanning soon after birth. Methods A cohort of 93 infants recruited from maternity hospitals in Singapore underwent diffusion tensor imaging between 5 to 17 days after birth. We did a cross-sectional examination of white matter microstructure of the brain among healthy term infants as a function of gestational age via voxel-based analysis on fractional anisotropy. Results Greater gestational age at birth in term infants was associated with larger fractional anisotropy values in early developing brain regions, when corrected for age at scan. Specifically, it was associated with a cluster located at the corpus callosum (corrected p<0.001), as well as another cluster spanning areas of the anterior corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, and external capsule (corrected p<0.001). Conclusions Our findings show variation in brain maturation associated with gestational age amongst ‘term’ infants, with increased brain maturation when born with a relatively higher gestational age in comparison to those infants born with a relatively younger gestational age. Future studies should explore if these differences in brain maturation between 37 and 41 weeks of gestational age will persist over time due to development outside the womb."

Using an NO-sensitive 4-amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM) fluorescent dye, we found that insulin increased NO production in mouse IMCD cells (mIMCD) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A concomitant dose-dependent increase in the NO metabolite (NOx) was also observed in the medium from insulin-stimulated cells. NO production peaked in mIMCD cells at a dose of 100 nm insulin with simultaneously increased NOx levels in the medium. At this dose, insulin significantly increased p-eNOSSer1177 levels in mIMCD cells. Pretreatment of cells with a PI 3-kinase inhibitor or insulin receptor silencing with RNA interference abolished these effects of insulin, whereas insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) silencing had no effect.

Both these sensors play a major role in physiological functions in normal tissue and in pathology, but available data on native STIM2-regulated plasma membrane channels are scarce. Only a few studies have recorded STIM2-induced CRAC (calcium release-activated calcium) currents. On the other hand, many cell types display store-operated currents different from CRAC. The STIM1 protein regulates not only CRAC but also transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels, but it has remained unclear whether STIM2 is capable of regulating store-operated non-CRAC channels. Here we present for the first time experimental evidence for the existence of endogenous non-CRAC STIM2-regulated channels. As shown in single-channel patch clamp experiments on HEK293 cells, selective activation of native STIM2 proteins or STIM2 overexpression results in store-operated activation of Imin channels, whereas STIM1 activation blocks this process. Changes in the ratio between active STIM2 and STIM1 proteins can switch the regulation of Imin channels between store-operated and store-independent modes. We have previously characterized electrophysiological properties of different Ca2+ influx channels coexisting in HEK293 cells. The results of this study show that STIM1 and STIM2 differ in the ability to activate these store-operated channels; Imin channels are regulated by STIM2, TRPC3-containing INS channels are induced by STIM1, and TRPC1-composed Imax channels are activated by both STIM1 and STIM2.

https://openalex.org/W2134720024,"Compared to the association between cigarette smoking and psychiatric disorders, relatively little is known about the relationship between smokeless tobacco use and psychiatric disorders. To identify the psychiatric correlates of smokeless tobacco use, the analysis used a national representative sample from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) wave 1. Smokeless tobacco use was classified as exclusive snuff use, exclusive chewing tobacco, and dual use of both snuff and chewing tobacco at some time in the smokeless tobacco user's life. Lifetime psychiatric disorders were obtained via structured diagnostic interviews. The results show that the prevalence of lifetime exclusive snuff use, exclusive chewing tobacco, and dual use of both snuff and chewing tobacco was 2.16%, 2.52%, and 2.79%, respectively. After controlling for sociodemographic variables and cigarette smoking, the odds of exclusive chewing tobacco in persons with panic disorder and specific phobia were 1.53 and 1.41 times the odds in persons without those disorders, respectively. The odds of exclusive snuff use, exclusive chewing tobacco, and dual use of both products for individuals with alcohol use disorder were 1.97, 2.01, and 2.99 times the odds for those without alcohol use disorder, respectively. Respondents with cannabis use disorder were 1.44 times more likely to use snuff exclusively than those without cannabis use disorder. Respondents with inhalant/solvent use disorder were associated with 3.33 times the odds of exclusive chewing tobacco. In conclusion, this study highlights the specific links of anxiety disorder, alcohol, cannabis, and inhalant/solvent use disorders with different types of smokeless tobacco use."

In this report, we compared the expressions of NER genes in 79 bladder cancer tissues with or without any recurrence by real-time PCR and then analyzed the varied NER genes by immunochemistry in 219 bladder cancer tissue samples. Based on the clinical data, we analyzed the clinical value of varied NER genes and smoking in 219 bladder cancers by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression. We found the expressions of the NER gene XPF and XPC were significantly lower in bladder cancer tissues with a recurrence compared with those without a recurrence at mRNA level. Also, the patients with the XPF and XPC defect had a statistically significant lower median recurrence-free survival time than those without the XPF and XPC defect, and smoking can make this difference more remarkable. Our results suggest that XPF and XPC expression may be a potential predictive factor for bladder cancer, and smoking can not only influence the recurrence of bladder cancer as a single factor but also aggravate the results of the XPF defect and XPC defect."
https://openalex.org/W1995485771,"Background When it comes to prevalidation, it is assumed that a higher preoperative level of physical activity leads to better postoperative recovery. However current literature is inconclusive about the effect of prevalidation on functional recovery of patients with primary osteoarthritis (OA) who underwent a THA or TKA. Therefore the aim of this study is to analyse one of the major assumptions underlying the potential effectiveness of prevalidation namely the relationship between preoperative physical activity level and postoperative recovery one year after THA or TKA in a group of 658 OA patients. Methods and Results From 2006 to 2012, 1061 patients underwent a primary THA or TKA at University Medical Center Groningen. Preoperative and one-year postoperative patients filled in the SQUASH questionnaire to get an impression of their physical activity level, and the WOMAC questionnaire to obtain insight into degree of recovery. Missing data were multiply imputed. No relationship was found between the preoperative total (B-coefficient = 0.03, CI95% = −0.033–0.093) and leisure-time physical activity level (B-coefficient = 0.042, CI95% = −0.009–0.093) neither for preoperative compliance with the Dutch Recommendation for Health-Enhancing Physical Activity (B-coefficient = 0.002, CI95% = −0.053–0.057), and the degree of recovery one year after surgery. Conclusion The preoperative physical activity level had no relation with the degree of recovery one year after THA or TKA. The results do not support one of the major assumptions behind prevalidation, which assumes that a higher preoperative physical activity level will lead to a better recovery after THA or TKA."

Based on structural and functional studies, ABC importers can be divided into two distinct classes, type I and type II.

Type II importers accept substrates in a nucleotide-free state, with hydrolysis driving an inward facing conformation. The ribose transporter in Escherichia coli is a tripartite complex consisting of a cytoplasmic ATP-binding cassette protein, RbsA, with fused nucleotide binding domains; a transmembrane domain homodimer, RbsC2; and a periplasmic substrate binding protein, RbsB. To investigate the transport mechanism of the complex RbsABC2, we probed intersubunit interactions by varying the presence of the substrate ribose and the hydrolysis cofactors, ATP/ADP and Mg2+.

https://openalex.org/W2013621782,"Cone photoreceptors require effective pigment regeneration mechanisms to maintain their sensitivity in the light. Our previous studies in carp cones suggested the presence of an unconventional and very effective mechanism to produce 11-cis retinal, the necessary component in pigment regeneration. In this reaction (aldehyde-alcohol redox coupling reaction, AL-OL coupling reaction), formation of 11-cis retinal, i.e. oxidation of 11-cis retinol is coupled to reduction of an aldehyde at a 1:1 molar ratio without exogenous NADP(H) which is usually required in this kind of reaction. Here, we identified carp retinol dehydrogenase 13-like (RDH13L) as an enzyme catalyzing the AL-OL coupling reaction. RDH13L was partially purified from purified carp cones, identified as a candidate protein, and its AL-OL coupling activity was confirmed using recombinant RDH13L. We further examined the substrate specificity, subcellular localization, and expression level of RDH13L. Based on these results, we concluded that RDH13L contributes to a significant part, but not all, of the AL-OL coupling activity in carp cones. RDH13L contained tightly bound NADP(+) which presumably functions as a cofactor in the reaction. Mouse RDH14, a mouse homolog of carp RDH13L, also showed the AL-OL coupling activity. Interestingly, although carp cone membranes, carp RDH13L and mouse RDH14 all showed the coupling activity at 15-37 °C, they also showed a conventional NADP(+)-dependent 11-cis retinol oxidation activity above 25 °C without addition of aldehydes. This dual mechanism of 11-cis retinal synthesis attained by carp RDH13L and mouse RDH14 probably contribute to effective pigment regeneration in cones that function in the light."

The novel fusion protein, called HMG, was constructed by genetically fusing mutated human derived G-CSF (mG-CSF) to the C-terminal of HSA and then prepared in Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of HMG was about 85 kDa and the isoelectric point was 5.3. Circular dichroism spectroscopy suggested that mG-CSF retained nearly all of its native secondary structure, regardless of fusion. The binding capabilities of mG-CSF moiety to G-CSF receptor and HSA moiety to warfarin showed very little change after fusing. The bioactivity of HMG (11.0×106 IU/mg) was more than twice that of rHSA/G-CSF (4.6×106 IU/mg). A mutation was made at the 718th amino acid of HMG, substituting Ala for Thr, to investigate the glycosylation of HMG expressed in P. pastoris. Data indicated that HMG was modified at Thr718, speculatively with the addition of a mannose chain. In conclusion, a novel HSA/G-CSF fusion protein was successfully constructed based on a mutated G-CSF. This protein showed more potent bioactivity than rHSA/G-CSF and thus may be a suitable long-acting G-CSF."
https://openalex.org/W2043003718,"Atherosclerosis is the primary cause for cardiovascular disease. Here we identified a novel mechanism underlying atherosclerosis, which is provided by ARIA (apoptosis regulator through modulating IAP expression), the transmembrane protein that we recently identified. ARIA is expressed in macrophages present in human atherosclerotic plaque as well as in mouse peritoneal macrophages. When challenged with acetylated LDL, peritoneal macrophages isolated from ARIA-deficient mice showed substantially reduced foam cell formation, whereas the uptake did not differ from that in wild-type macrophages. Mechanistically, loss of ARIA enhanced PI3K/Akt signaling and consequently reduced the expression of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase-1 (ACAT-1), an enzyme that esterifies cholesterol and promotes its storage, in macrophages. Inhibition of PI3K abolished the reduction in ACAT-1 expression and foam cell formation in ARIA-deficient macrophages. In contrast, overexpression of ARIA reduced Akt activity and enhanced foam cell formation in RAW264.7 macrophages, which was abrogated by treatment with ACAT inhibitor. Of note, genetic deletion of ARIA significantly reduced the atherosclerosis in ApoE-deficient mice. Oil red-O-positive lipid-rich lesion was reduced, which was accompanied by an increase of collagen fiber and decrease of necrotic core lesion in atherosclerotic plaque in ARIA/ApoE double-deficient mice. Analysis of bone marrow chimeric mice revealed that loss of ARIA in bone marrow cells was sufficient to reduce the atherosclerogenesis in ApoE-deficient mice. Together, we identified a unique role of ARIA in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis at least partly by modulating macrophage foam cell formation. Our results indicate that ARIA could serve as a novel pharmacotherapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerotic diseases. Background: Macrophages play central roles in the whole process of atherosclerosis. Results: ARIA regulates macrophage foam cell formation at least in part by modulating ACAT-1 expression. Conclusion: ARIA is a novel factor involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Significance: Loss of ARIA ameliorated atherosclerosis by reducing macrophage foam cell formation; inhibition of ARIA may represent a new line of therapy against atherosclerosis."
