https://openalex.org/W2594764564,"The organization of the genome in the nucleus and the interactions of genes with their regulatory elements are key features of transcriptional control and their disruption can cause disease. Here we report a genome-wide method, genome architecture mapping (GAM), for measuring chromatin contacts and other features of three-dimensional chromatin topology on the basis of sequencing DNA from a large collection of thin nuclear sections. We apply GAM to mouse embryonic stem cells and identify enrichment for specific interactions between active genes and enhancers across very large genomic distances using a mathematical model termed SLICE (statistical inference of co-segregation). GAM also reveals an abundance of three-way contacts across the genome, especially between regions that are highly transcribed or contain super-enhancers, providing a level of insight into genome architecture that, owing to the technical limitations of current technologies, has previously remained unattainable. Furthermore, GAM highlights a role for gene-expression-specific contacts in organizing the genome in mammalian nuclei."

https://openalex.org/W2591627715,"Although the main focus of immuno-oncology has been manipulating the adaptive immune system, harnessing both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system might produce superior tumour reduction and elimination. Tumour-associated macrophages often have net pro-tumour effects, but their embedded location and their untapped potential provide impetus to discover strategies to turn them against tumours. Strategies that deplete (anti-CSF-1 antibodies and CSF-1R inhibition) or stimulate (agonistic anti-CD40 or inhibitory anti-CD47 antibodies) tumour-associated macrophages have had some success. We hypothesized that pharmacologic modulation of macrophage phenotype could produce an anti-tumour effect. We previously reported that a first-in-class selective class IIa histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, TMP195, influenced human monocyte responses to the colony-stimulating factors CSF-1 and CSF-2 in vitro. Here, we utilize a macrophage-dependent autochthonous mouse model of breast cancer to demonstrate that in vivo TMP195 treatment alters the tumour microenvironment and reduces tumour burden and pulmonary metastases by modulating macrophage phenotypes. TMP195 induces the recruitment and differentiation of highly phagocytic and stimulatory macrophages within tumours. Furthermore, combining TMP195 with chemotherapy regimens or T-cell checkpoint blockade in this model significantly enhances the durability of tumour reduction. These data introduce class IIa HDAC inhibition as a means to harness the anti-tumour potential of macrophages to enhance cancer therapy."

https://openalex.org/W2592143606,"Bone has recently emerged as a pleiotropic endocrine organ that secretes at least two hormones, FGF23 and osteocalcin, which regulate kidney function and glucose homeostasis, respectively. These findings have raised the question of whether other bone-derived hormones exist and what their potential functions are. Here we identify, through molecular and genetic analyses in mice, lipocalin 2 (LCN2) as an osteoblast-enriched, secreted protein. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments in mice demonstrate that osteoblast-derived LCN2 maintains glucose homeostasis by inducing insulin secretion and improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. In addition, osteoblast-derived LCN2 inhibits food intake. LCN2 crosses the blood-brain barrier, binds to the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) in the paraventricular and ventromedial neurons of the hypothalamus and activates an MC4R-dependent anorexigenic (appetite-suppressing) pathway. These results identify LCN2 as a bone-derived hormone with metabolic regulatory effects, which suppresses appetite in a MC4R-dependent manner, and show that the control of appetite is an endocrine function of bone."
https://openalex.org/W2592549031,"In chemical syntheses, the activation of carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bonds converts them directly into carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom bonds without requiring any prior functionalization. C-H activation can thus substantially reduce the number of steps involved in a synthesis. A single specific C-H bond in a substrate can be activated by using a 'directing' (usually a functional) group to obtain the desired product selectively. The applicability of such a C-H activation reaction can be severely curtailed by the distance of the C-H bond in question from the directing group, and by the shape of the substrate, but several approaches have been developed to overcome these limitations. In one such approach, an understanding of the distal and geometric relationships between the functional groups and C-H bonds of a substrate has been exploited to achieve meta-selective C-H activation by using a covalently attached, U-shaped template. However, stoichiometric installation of this template has not been feasible in the absence of an appropriate functional group on which to attach it. Here we report the design of a catalytic, bifunctional nitrile template that binds a heterocyclic substrate via a reversible coordination instead of a covalent linkage. The two metal centres coordinated to this template have different roles: one reversibly anchors substrates near the catalyst, and the other cleaves remote C-H bonds. Using this strategy, we demonstrate remote, site-selective C-H olefination of heterocyclic substrates that do not have the necessary functional groups for covalently attaching templates."
https://openalex.org/W2594514058,"The heating of the fluids used in electronic cigarettes (""e-cigarettes"") used to create ""vaping"" aerosols is capable of causing a wide range of degradation reaction products. We investigated formation of benzene (an important human carcinogen) from e-cigarette fluids containing propylene glycol (PG), glycerol (GL), benzoic acid, the flavor chemical benzaldehyde, and nicotine.Three e-cigarette devices were used: the JUULTM ""pod"" system (provides no user accessible settings other than flavor cartridge choice), and two refill tank systems that allowed a range of user accessible power settings. Benzene in the e-cigarette aerosols was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Benzene formation was ND (not detected) in the JUUL system. In the two tank systems benzene was found to form from propylene glycol (PG) and glycerol (GL), and from the additives benzoic acid and benzaldehyde, especially at high power settings. With 50:50 PG+GL, for tank device 1 at 6W and 13W, the formed benzene concentrations were 1.9 and 750 μg/m3. For tank device 2, at 6W and 25W, the formed concentrations were ND and 1.8 μg/m3. With benzoic acid and benzaldehyde at ~10 mg/mL, for tank device 1, values at 13W were as high as 5000 μg/m3. For tank device 2 at 25W, all values were ≤~100 μg/m3. These values may be compared with what can be expected in a conventional (tobacco) cigarette, namely 200,000 μg/m3. Thus, the risks from benzene will be lower from e-cigarettes than from conventional cigarettes. However, ambient benzene air concentrations in the U.S. have typically been 1 μg/m3, so that benzene has been named the largest single known cancer-risk air toxic in the U.S. For non-smokers, chronically repeated exposure to benzene from e-cigarettes at levels such as 100 or higher μg/m3 will not be of negligible risk."
https://openalex.org/W2593642172,"The cellular response to hypoxia is critical for cell survival and is fine-tuned to allow cells to recover from hypoxic stress and adapt to heterogeneous or fluctuating oxygen levels. The hypoxic response is mediated by the α-subunit of the transcription factor HIF-1 (HIF-1α), which interacts through its intrinsically disordered C-terminal transactivation domain with the TAZ1 (also known as CH1) domain of the general transcriptional coactivators CBP and p300 to control the transcription of critical adaptive genes. One such gene encodes CITED2, a negative feedback regulator that attenuates HIF-1 transcriptional activity by competing for TAZ1 binding through its own disordered transactivation domain. Little is known about the molecular mechanism by which CITED2 displaces the tightly bound HIF-1α from their common cellular target. The HIF-1α and CITED2 transactivation domains bind to TAZ1 through helical motifs that flank a conserved LP(Q/E)L sequence that is essential for negative feedback regulation. Here we show that human CITED2 displaces HIF-1α by forming a transient ternary complex with TAZ1 and HIF-1α and competing for a shared binding site through its LPEL motif, thus promoting a conformational change in TAZ1 that increases the rate of HIF-1α dissociation. Through allosteric enhancement of HIF-1α release, CITED2 activates a highly responsive negative feedback circuit that rapidly and efficiently attenuates the hypoxic response, even at modest CITED2 concentrations. This hypersensitive regulatory switch is entirely dependent on the unique flexibility and binding properties of these intrinsically disordered proteins and probably exemplifies a common strategy used by the cell to respond rapidly to environmental signals."
https://openalex.org/W2592045980,"Probiotics have been described as a potential strategy to control opportunistic infections due to their ability to stimulate the immune system. Using the non-vertebrate model host Galleria mellonella, we evaluated whether clinical isolates of Lactobacillus spp. are able to provide protection against Candida albicans infection. Among different strains of Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus fermentum, we verified that L. paracasei 28.4 strain had the greatest ability to prolong the survival of larvae infected with a lethal dose of C. albicans. We found that the injection of 107 cells/larvae of L. paracasei into G. mellonella larvae infected by C. albicans increased the survival of these insects compared to the control group (P = 0.0001). After that, we investigated the immune mechanisms involved in the protection against C. albicans infection, evaluating the number of hemocytes and the gene expression of antifungal peptides. We found that L. paracasei increased the hemocyte quantity (2.38 x 106 cells/mL) in relation to the control group (1.29 x 106 cells/mL), indicating that this strain is capable of raising the number of circulating hemocytes into the G. mellonella hemolymph. Further, we found that L. paracasei 28.4 upregulated genes that encode the antifungal peptides galiomicin and gallerymicin. In relation to the control group, L. paracasei 28.4 increased gene expression of galiomicin by 6.67-fold and 17.29-fold for gallerymicin. Finally, we verified that the prophylactic provision of probiotic led to a significant reduction of the number of fungal cells in G. mellonella hemolymph. In conclusion, L. paracasei 28.4 can modulate the immune system of G. mellonella and protect against candidiasis."
https://openalex.org/W2593117517,"The physiologic properties of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) make it a potent candidate drug target in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). GLP-1 is capable of regulating the blood glucose level by insulin secretion after administration of oral glucose. The advantages of GLP-1 for the avoidance of hypoglycemia and the control of body weight are attractive despite its poor stability. The clinical efficacies of long-acting GLP-1 derivatives strongly support discovery pursuits aimed at identifying and developing orally active, small-molecule GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize a novel oral agonist of GLP-1R (i.e., myricetin). The insulinotropic characterization of myricetin was performed in isolated islets and in Wistar rats. Long-term oral administration of myricetin demonstrated glucoregulatory activity. The data in this study suggest that myricetin might be a potential drug candidate for the treatment of T2DM as a GLP-1R agonist. Further structural modifications on myricetin might improve its pharmacology and pharmacokinetics.-Li, Y., Zheng, X., Yi, X., Liu, C., Kong, D., Zhang, J., Gong, M.

https://openalex.org/W2592213010,"The selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator tamoxifen inhibits ER signaling in breast cancer cells, and it is used for the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer. However, this type of cancer often acquires resistance to tamoxifen, and a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tamoxifen resistance is required. In this study, we established tamoxifen-resistant (TAM-R) breast cancer cells by long-term tamoxifen treatment of ER-positive breast cancer MCF7 cells. In TAM-R cells, expression of not only ERα, a major form of ER in breast cancer, but also its transcriptional partner forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) was found to be reduced. In contrast, activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and expression of its target IL6 were increased in these cells. Stable expression of FOXA1, but not ERα, reduced the expression of IL6 in the FOXA1- and ERα-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells and TAM-R cells, without affecting the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathways. Conversely, FOXA1 knockdown induced IL6 expression in MCF7 cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that FOXA1 bound to the promoter region of IL6 and repressed recruitment of the NF-κB complex to this region. TAM-R cells were found to have high mammosphere-forming activity, characteristics of cancer stem cells, and this activity was suppressed by NF-κB and IL6 signaling inhibitors. Taken together, these results suggest that FOXA1 suppresses expression of IL6 through inhibition of NF-κB recruitment to the IL6 promoter in an ERα-independent manner and that reduction in FOXA1 expression induces IL6 expression and contributes to cancer stem cell-like properties in TAM-R cells.

https://openalex.org/W2592692332,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a ubiquitous reversible epigenetic RNA modification that plays an important role in the regulation of post-transcriptional protein coding gene expression. Liver is a vital organ and plays a major role in metabolism with numerous functions. Information concerning the dynamic patterns of mRNA m6A methylation during postnatal development of liver has been long overdue and elucidation of this information will benefit for further deciphering a multitude of functional outcomes of mRNA m6A methylation. Here, we profile transcriptome-wide m6A in porcine liver at three developmental stages: newborn (0 day), suckling (21 days) and adult (2 years). About 33% of transcribed genes were modified by m6A, with 1.33 to 1.42 m6A peaks per modified gene. m6A was distributed predominantly around stop codons. The consensus motif sequence RRm6ACH was observed in 78.90% of m6A peaks. A negative correlation (average Pearson's r = -0.45, P < 10-16) was found between levels of m6A methylation and gene expression. Functional enrichment analysis of genes consistently modified by m6A methylation at all three stages showed genes relevant to important functions, including regulation of growth and development, regulation of metabolic processes and protein catabolic processes. Genes with higher m6A methylation and lower expression levels at any particular stage were associated with the biological processes required for or unique to that stage. We suggest that differential m6A methylation may be important for the regulation of nutrient metabolism in porcine liver."
https://openalex.org/W2592014993,"Adhesive small bowel obstruction remains a common problem for surgeons. After surgery, platelet aggregation contributes to coagulation cascade and fibrin clot formation. With clotting, fibrin degradation is simultaneously enhanced, driven by tissue plasminogen activator–mediated cleavage of plasminogen to form plasmin. The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular events and proteolytic responses that surround plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1; Serpine1) inhibition of postoperative adhesion. Peritoneal adhesion was induced by gauze deposition in the abdominal cavity in C57BL/6 mice and those that were deficient in fibrinolytic factors, such as Plat−/− and Serpine1−/−. In addition, C57BL/6 mice were treated with the novel PAI-1 inhibitor, TM5275. Some animals were treated with clodronate to deplete macrophages. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) experiments were performed to understand the role of macrophages and how EGF contributes to adhesion. In the early phase of adhesive small bowel obstruction, increased PAI-1 activity was observed in the peritoneal cavity. Genetic and pharmacologic PAI-1 inhibition prevented progression of adhesion and increased circulating plasmin. Whereas Serpine1−/− mice showed intra-abdominal bleeding, mice that were treated with TM5275 did not. Mechanistically, PAI-1, in combination with tissue plasminogen activator, served as a chemoattractant for macrophages that, in turn, secreted EGF and up-regulated the receptor, HER1, on peritoneal mesothelial cells, which led to PAI-1 secretion, further fueling the vicious cycle of impaired fibrinolysis at the adhesive site. Controlled inhibition of PAI-1 not only enhanced activation of the fibrinolytic system, but also prevented recruitment of EGF-secreting macrophages. Pharmacologic PAI-1 inhibition ameliorated adhesion formation in a macrophage-dependent manner.—Honjo, K., Munakata, S., Tashiro, Y., Salama, Y., Shimazu, H., Eiamboonsert, S., Dhahri, D., Ichimura, A., Dan, T., Miyata, T., Takeda, K., Sakamoto, K., Hattori, K., Heissig, B.

https://openalex.org/W2592471288,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes significant infant morbidity and mortality. For decades severe RSV-induced disease was thought to result from an uncontrolled host response to viral replication, but recent work suggests that a strong innate immune response early in infection is protective. To shed light on host-virus interactions and the viral determinants of disease, copy numbers of five RSV genes (NS1, NS2, N, G, F) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in nasal wash samples from children with RSV-associated bronchiolitis. Correlations were sought with host cytokines/chemokines and biomarkers. Associations with disposition from the emergency department (hospitalized or sent home) and pulse oximetry O2 saturation levels were also sought. Additionally, RNase P copy number was measured and used to normalize nasal wash data. RSV gene copy numbers were found to significantly correlate with both cytokine/chemokine and biomarker levels; and RNase P-normalized viral gene copy numbers (NS1, NS2, N and G) were significantly higher in infants with less severe disease. Moreover, three of the normalized viral gene copy numbers (NS1, NS2, and N) correlated significantly with arterial O2 saturation levels. The data support a model where a higher viral load early in infection can promote a robust innate immune response that protects against progression into hypoxic RSV-induced lower respiratory tract illness."
https://openalex.org/W2593741166,"We study the economic cost of dementia in Chile, and its variation according to socioeconomic status (SES). We use primary data from a survey of 330 informal primary caregivers who completed both a RUD-Lite and a socio-demographic questionnaire to evaluate the severity of dementia and caregiver’s burden. The costs of dementia are broken into three components: direct medical costs (medical care, drugs, tests); direct social costs (social service, daycare); and indirect costs (mostly associated to informal care). The average monthly cost per patient is estimated at US$ 1,463. Direct medical costs account for 20 per cent, direct social costs for 5 per cent and indirect costs for 75 per cent of the total cost. The mean monthly cost is found to be inversely related to SES, a pattern largely driven by indirect costs. The monthly cost for high SES is US$ 1,083 and US$ 1,588 for low SES. A multivariate regression analysis suggests that severity of dementia and caregiver’s burden account for between 49 and 70 per cent of the difference in the indirect cost across SES. However, between one-third and one-half of the variation across SES is not due to gradient in severity of dementia. Direct medical costs increase in higher SES, reflecting differences in purchasing power, while indirect costs are inversely related to SES and more than compensate differences in medical costs. Moreover, in lower SES groups, female caregivers, typically family members who are inactive in the labor market, mostly provide informal care. The average annual cost of dementia in Chile (US$ 17,559) is lower in comparison to high-income countries (US$ 39,595) and the proportion of cost related to informal cost is higher (74 per cent compared to 40 per cent). SES is a key determinant in the cost of dementia. In the absence of universal access to treatment, part of the social cost of dementia potentially preserves or increases income and gender inequality."
https://openalex.org/W2592729020,"The multi-cellular nature of renal tissue makes it the most challenging organ for regeneration. Therefore, till date whole organ transplantations remain the definitive treatment for the end stage renal disease (ESRD). The shortage of available organs for the transplantation has, thus, remained a major concern as well as an unsolved problem. In this regard generation of whole organ scaffold through decellularization followed by regeneration of the whole organ by recellularization is being viewed as a potential alternative for generating functional tissues. Despite its growing interest, the optimal processing to achieve functional organ still remains unsolved. The biggest challenge remains is the time line for obtaining kidney. Keeping these facts in mind, we have assessed the effects of cryostorage (3 months) on renal tissue architecture and its potential for decellularization and recellularization in comparison to the freshly isolated kidneys. The light microscopy exploiting different microscopic stains as well as immuno-histochemistry and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrated that ECM framework is well retained following kidney cryopreservation. The strength of these structures was reinforced by calculating mechanical stress which confirmed the similarity between the freshly isolated and cryopreserved tissue. The recellularization of these bio-scaffolds, with mesenchymal stem cells quickly repopulated the decellularized structures irrespective of the kidneys status, i.e. freshly isolated or the cryopreserved. The growth pattern employing mesenchymal stem cells demonstrated their equivalent recellularization potential. Based on these observations, it may be concluded that cryopreserved kidneys can be exploited as scaffolds for future development of functional organ."
https://openalex.org/W2593667134,"Liver organoids (LOs) are of interest in tissue replacement, hepatotoxicity and pathophysiological studies. However, it is still unclear what triggers LO self-assembly and what the optimal environment is for their culture. Hypothesizing that LO formation occurs as a result of a fine balance between cell-substrate adhesion and cell-cell cohesion, we used 3 cell types (hepatocytes, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and mesenchymal stem cells) to investigate LO self-assembly on different substrates keeping the culture parameters (e.g. culture media, cell types/number) and substrate stiffness constant. As cellular spheroids may suffer from oxygen depletion in the core, we also sought to identify the optimal culture conditions for LOs in order to guarantee an adequate supply of oxygen during proliferation and differentiation. The oxygen consumption characteristics of LOs were measured using an O2 sensor and used to model the O2 concentration gradient in the organoids. We show that no LO formation occurs on highly adhesive hepatic extra-cellular matrix-based substrates, suggesting that cellular aggregation requires an optimal trade-off between the adhesiveness of a substrate and the cohesive forces between cells and that this balance is modulated by substrate mechanics. Thus, in addition to substrate stiffness, physicochemical properties, which are also critical for cell adhesion, play a role in LO self-assembly."

To this end, we purified an endo-β-1,2-glucanase to homogeneity from cell extracts of the environmental species Chitinophaga arvensicola, and an endo-β-1,2-glucanase candidate gene (Cpin_6279) was cloned from the related species Chitinophaga pinensis.

https://openalex.org/W2592609847,"Identification of individuals who are at risk of suffering from acute coronary syndromes (ACS) may allow to introduce preventative measures. We aimed to identify ACS-related urinary peptides, that combined as a pattern can be used as prognostic biomarker. Proteomic data of 252 individuals enrolled in four prospective studies from Australia, Europe and North America were analyzed. 126 of these had suffered from ACS within a period of up to 5 years post urine sampling (cases). Proteomic analysis of 84 cases and 84 matched controls resulted in the discovery of 75 ACS-related urinary peptides. Combining these to a peptide pattern, we established a prognostic biomarker named Acute Coronary Syndrome Predictor 75 (ACSP75). ACSP75 demonstrated reasonable prognostic discrimination (c-statistic = 0.664), which was similar to Framingham risk scoring (c-statistics = 0.644) in a validation cohort of 42 cases and 42 controls. However, generating by a composite algorithm named Acute Coronary Syndrome Composite Predictor (ACSCP), combining the biomarker pattern ACSP75 with the previously established urinary proteomic biomarker CAD238 characterizing coronary artery disease as the underlying aetiology, and age as a risk factor, further improved discrimination (c-statistic = 0.751) resulting in an added prognostic value over Framingham risk scoring expressed by an integrated discrimination improvement of 0.273 ± 0.048 (P < 0.0001) and net reclassification improvement of 0.405 ± 0.113 (P = 0.0007). In conclusion, we demonstrate that urinary peptide biomarkers have the potential to predict future ACS events in asymptomatic patients. Further large scale studies are warranted to determine the role of urinary biomarkers in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2593687930,"Waterpipe (also called hookah, shisha, or narghile) smoking is a common form of tobacco use in the Middle East. Its use is becoming more prevalent in Western societies, especially among young adults as an alternative form of tobacco use to traditional cigarettes. While the risk to cigarette smoking is well documented, the risk to waterpipe smoking is not well defined with limited information on its health impact at the epidemiologic, clinical and biologic levels with respect to lung disease. Based on the knowledge that airway epithelial cell DNA methylation is modified in response to cigarette smoke and in cigarette smoking-related lung diseases, we assessed the impact of light-use waterpipe smoking on DNA methylation of the small airway epithelium (SAE) and whether changes in methylation were linked to the transcriptional output of the cells. Small airway epithelium was obtained from 7 nonsmokers and 7 light-use (2.6 ± 1.7 sessions/wk) waterpipe-only smokers. Genome-wide comparison of SAE DNA methylation of waterpipe smokers to nonsmokers identified 727 probesets differentially methylated (fold-change >1.5, p<0.05) representing 673 unique genes. Dominant pathways associated with these epigenetic changes include those linked to G-protein coupled receptor signaling, aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling and xenobiotic metabolism signaling, all of which have been associated with cigarette smoking and lung disease. Of the genes differentially methylated, 11.3% exhibited a corresponding significant (p<0.05) change in gene expression with enrichment in pathways related to regulation of mRNA translation and protein synthesis (eIF2 signaling and regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling). Overall, these data demonstrate that light-use waterpipe smoking is associated with epigenetic changes and related transcriptional modifications in the SAE, the cell population demonstrating the earliest pathologic abnormalities associated with chronic cigarette smoking."
https://openalex.org/W2594672107,"Background COPD-diagnosis is confirmed by post-bronchodilator (BD) spirometry. However, epidemiological studies often rely on pre-BD spirometry, self-reports, or medical records. This population-based study aims to determine COPD-prevalence based on four different operational definitions and their level of agreement, and to compare associations between COPD-definitions and risk factors. Methods COPD-prevalence in 1,793 adults from the general Dutch population (aged 18–70 years) was assessed based on self-reported data, Electronic Medical Records (EMR), and post-BD spirometry: using the FEV1/FVC below the lower limit of normal (LLN) and GOLD fixed cut-off (FEV1/FVC <0.70). Using spirometry as a reference, sensitivity was calculated for self-reported and EMR-based COPD. Associations between COPD and known risk factors were assessed with logistic regression. Data were collected as part of the cross-sectional VGO study (Livestock Farming and Neighboring Residents’ Health Study). Results The highest prevalence was found based on spirometry (GOLD: 10.9%, LLN: 5.9%), followed by self-report (4.6%) and EMR (2.9%). Self-reported or EMR-based COPD identified less than 30% of all COPD-cases based on spirometry. The direction of association between known risk factors and COPD was similar across the four definitions, however, magnitude and significance varied. Especially indicators of allergy were more strongly associated with self-reported COPD compared to the other definitions. Conclusions COPD-prevalence varied depending on the used definition. A substantial number of subjects with spirometry-based COPD cannot be identified with questionnaires or medical records which can cause underestimation of COPD-prevalence. The influence of the different COPD-definitions on associations with known risk factors was limited."
https://openalex.org/W2592524648,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a large high-risk population for HIV infection in recent years in China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Hangzhou, China, to determine rates of condomless anal intercourse (CAI), recent HIV testing (in the recent year) and associated factors using respondent-driven sampling. Questionnaires using face-to-face interviews were employed to collect data on sexual risk behaviors and HIV testing. Five hundred eleven MSM were recruited, of which 459 (89.8%) had anal intercourse in the past 6 months. Of these 459 participants, 457 (99.6%) answered whether they had taken an HIV test in the recent year, so only their data were analyzed. Weighted data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The CAI rate with male partners in the past 6 months was 43.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 34.0–51.5%), while the rate of condomless vaginal intercourse (CVI) was 21.6% (95% CI, 15.6–32.3%). The prevalence of recent HIV testing was 56.8% (95% CI, 48.7–66.5%), while the prevalence of HIV and syphilis were 8.8% and 6.5%, respectively. Multivariate analysis indicated that CAI was associated with earlier homosexual debut, suicidal inclinations, childhood sexual abuse, HIV testing in the recent year, and lower estimate of HIV prevalence. Recent HIV testing was associated with homosexual debut age, engaging in CAI with male partners in the past 6 months, having oral sex in the past 6 months, self-perceived higher likelihood of HIV infection, knowing about antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS, receiving AIDS/sexually transmitted infection (STI) interventions in the past year, and syphilis infection. Given high prevalence of HIV and syphilis, high levels of CAI and CVI, and low HIV testing rate, the results indicated high risk of HIV infection and transmission among MSM. HIV prevention interventions should target MSM with early homosexual debut and psychosocial health problems, while HIV/AIDS education among MSM should focus on increasing knowledge of HIV risk, estimated HIV prevalence and antiretroviral therapy, and improving risk perception of HIV acquisition."

Non-human primate (NHP) models provide the most relevant pre-clinical models of human disease and play a critical role in vaccine development. Models utilising Asian cynomolgus macaque populations are well established but the restricted genetic diversity of the Mauritian cynomolgus macaques may be of added value. Methods Mauritian cynomolgus macaques were exposed to a range of doses of M. tuberculosis delivered by aerosol, and the outcome was assessed using clinical, imaging and pathology-based measures. Results All macaques developed characteristic clinical signs and disease features of tuberculosis (TB). Disease burden and the ability to control disease were dependent on exposure dose. Mauritian cynomolgus macaques showed less variation in pulmonary disease burden and total gross pathology scores within exposure dose groups than either Indian rhesus macaques or Chinese cynomolgus macaques Conclusions The genetic homogeneity of Mauritian cynomolgus macaques makes them a potentially useful model of human tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2592763385,"Isoxadifen-ethyl can effectively alleviate nicosulfuron injury in the maize. However, the effects of safener isoxadifen-ethyl on detoxifying enzymes in maize is unknown. The individual and combined effects of the sulfonylurea herbicide nicosulfuron and the safener isoxadifen-ethyl on the growth and selected physiological processes of maize were evaluated. Bioassays showed that the EC50 values of nicosulfuron and nicosulfuron plus isoxadifen-ethyl for maize cultivar Zhengdan958 were 18.87 and 249.28 mg kg-1, respectively, and were 24.8 and 275.51 mg kg-1, respectively, for Zhenghuangnuo No. 2 cultivar. Evaluations of the target enzyme of acetolactate synthase showed that the I50 values of nicosulfuron and nicosulfuron plus isoxadifen-ethyl for the ALS of Zhengdan958 were 15.46 and 28.56 μmol L-1, respectively, and were 0.57 and 2.17 μmol L-1, respectively, for the acetolactate synthase of Zhenghuangnuo No. 2. The safener isoxadifen-ethyl significantly enhanced tolerance of maize to nicosulfuron. The enhanced tolerance of maize to nicosulfuron in the presence of the safener, coupled with the enhanced injury observed in the presence of piperonyl butoxide, 1-aminobenzotriazole, and malathion, suggested cytochrome P450 monooxygenases may be involved in metabolism of nicosulfuron. We proposed that isoxadifen-ethyl increases plant metabolism of nicosulfuron through non-P450-catalyzed routes or through P450 monooxygenases not inhibited by piperonyl butoxide, 1-aminobenzotriazole, and malathion. Isoxadifen-ethyl, at a rate of 33 mg kg-1, completely reversed the effects of all doses (37.5-300 mg kg-1) of nicosulfuron on both of the maize cultivars. When the two compounds were given simultaneously, isoxadifen-ethyl enhanced activity of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and acetolactate synthase activity in maize. The free acid 4,5-dihydro-5,5-diphenyl-1,2-oxazole-3-carboxylic was equally effective at inducing GSTs as the parent ester and appeared to be the active safener. GST induction in the maize Zhenghuangnuo No. 2 was faster than in Zhengdan 958."
https://openalex.org/W2593574879,"Plants initially accepted by foraging leaf-cutting ants are later avoided if they prove unsuitable for their symbiotic fungus. Plant avoidance is mediated by the waste produced in the fungus garden soon after the incorporation of the unsuitable leaves, as foragers can learn plant odors and cues from the damaged fungus that are both present in the recently produced waste particles. We asked whether avoidance learning of plants unsuitable for the symbiotic fungus can take place entirely at the colony dump. In order to investigate whether cues available in the waste chamber induce plant avoidance in naïve subcolonies, we exchanged the waste produced by subcolonies fed either fungicide-treated privet leaves or untreated leaves and measured the acceptance of untreated privet leaves before and after the exchange of waste. Second, we evaluated whether foragers could perceive the avoidance cues directly at the dump by quantifying the visits of labeled foragers to the waste chamber. Finally, we asked whether foragers learn to specifically avoid untreated leaves of a plant after a confinement over 3 hours in the dump of subcolonies that were previously fed fungicide-treated leaves of that species. After the exchange of the waste chambers, workers from subcolonies that had access to waste from fungicide-treated privet leaves learned to avoid that plant. One-third of the labeled foragers visited the dump. Furthermore, naïve foragers learned to avoid a specific, previously unsuitable plant if exposed solely to cues of the dump during confinement. We suggest that cues at the dump enable foragers to predict the unsuitable effects of plants even if they had never been experienced in the fungus garden."
https://openalex.org/W2593741637,"Increased nutrient and sediment loading in rivers have caused observable changes in algal community composition, and thereby, altered the quality and quantity of food resources available to native freshwater mussels. Our objective was to characterize the relationship between nutrient conditions and mussel food quality and examine the effects on fatty acid composition, growth and survival of juvenile mussels. Juvenile Lampsilis cardium and L. siliquoidea were deployed in cages for 28 d at four riverine and four lacustrine sites in the lower St. Croix River, Minnesota/Wisconsin, USA. Mussel foot tissue and food resources (four seston fractions and surficial sediment) were analyzed for quantitative fatty acid (FA) composition. Green algae were abundant in riverine sites, whereas cyanobacteria were most abundant in the lacustrine sites. Mussel survival was high (95%) for both species. Lampsilis cardium exhibited lower growth relative to L. siliquoidea (p <0.0001), but growth of L. cardium was not significantly different across sites (p = 0.13). In contrast, growth of L. siliquoidea was significantly greater at the most upstream riverine site compared to the lower three lacustrine sites (p = 0.002). In situ growth of Lampsilis siliquoidea was positively related to volatile solids (10 – 32 μm fraction), total phosphorus (<10 and 10 – 32 μm fractions), and select FA in the seston (docosapentaeonic acid, DPA, 22:5n3; 4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic, 22:5n6; arachidonic acid, ARA, 20:4n6; and 24:0 in the <10 and 10 – 32 μm fractions). Our laboratory feeding experiment also indicated high accumulation ratios for 22:5n3, 22:5n6, and 20:4n6 in mussel tissue relative to supplied algal diet. In contrast, growth of L. siliquiodea was negatively related to nearly all FAs in the largest size fraction (i.e., >63 μm) of seston, including the bacterial FAs, and several of the FAs associated with sediments. Reduced mussel growth was observed in L. siliquoidea when the abundance of cyanobacteria exceeded 9% of the total phytoplankton biovolume. Areas dominated by cyanobacteria may not provide sufficient food quality to promote or sustain mussel growth."
https://openalex.org/W2594872233,"Our understanding of early gnathostome evolution has been hampered by a generally scant fossil record beyond the Devonian. Recent discoveries from the late Silurian Xiaoxiang Fauna of Yunnan, China, have yielded significant new information, including the earliest articulated osteichthyan fossils from the Ludlow-aged Kuanti Formation. Here we describe the partial postcranium of a new primitive bony fish from the Kuanti Formation that represents the second known taxon of pre-Devonian osteichthyan revealing articulated remains. The new form, Sparalepis tingi gen. et sp. nov., displays similarities with Guiyu and Psarolepis, including a spine-bearing pectoral girdle and a placoderm-like dermal pelvic girdle, a structure only recently identified in early osteichthyans. The squamation with particularly thick rhombic scales shares an overall morphological similarity to that of Psarolepis. However, the anterior flank scales of Sparalepis possess an unusual interlocking system of ventral bulges embraced by dorsal concavities on the outer surfaces. A phylogenetic analysis resolves Sparalepis within a previously recovered cluster of stem-sarcopterygians including Guiyu, Psarolepis and Achoania. The high diversity of osteichthyans from the Ludlow of Yunnan strongly contrasts with other Silurian vertebrate assemblages, suggesting that the South China block may have been an early center of diversification for early gnathostomes, well before the advent of the Devonian “Age of Fishes”."
https://openalex.org/W2592767437,"The CXC-chemokine receptor 6 (CXCR6) is a class A GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor (GPCRs) that mediates adhesion of leukocytes by interacting with the transmembrane cell surface-expressed chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16), and also regulates leukocyte migration by interacting with the soluble shed variant of CXCL16. In contrast to virtually all other chemokine receptors with chemotactic activity, CXCR6 carries a DRF motif instead of the typical DRY motif as a key element in receptor activation and G protein coupling. In this work, modeling analyses revealed that the phenylalanine F3.51 in CXCR6 might have impact on intramolecular interactions including hydrogen bonds by this possibly changing receptor function. Initial investigations with embryonic kidney HEK293 cells and further studies with monocytic THP-1 cells showed that mutation of DRF into DRY does not influence ligand binding, receptor internalization, receptor recycling, and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. Adhesion was slightly decreased in a time-dependent manner. However, CXCL16-induced calcium signaling and migration were increased. Vice versa, when the DRY motif of the related receptor CX3CR1 was mutated into DRF the migratory response towards CX3CL1 was diminished, indicating that the presence of a DRF motif generally impairs chemotaxis in chemokine receptors. Transmembrane and soluble CXCL16 play divergent roles in homeostasis, inflammation, and cancer, which can be beneficial or detrimental. Therefore, the DRF motif of CXCR6 may display a receptor adaptation allowing adhesion and cell retention by transmembrane CXCL16 but reducing the chemotactic response to soluble CXCL16. This adaptation may avoid permanent or uncontrolled recruitment of inflammatory cells as well as cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2593941778,"Background Perinatal vitamin D deficiency is associated with a higher risk of wheezing in childhood. However, the relationship between vitamin D levels and lung function in infancy has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of perinatal vitamin D levels on respiratory function and disease outcome in infancy. Materials and methods Full-term infants without any chronic diseases or major anomalies were enrolled in the Prediction of Allergies in Taiwanese Children cohort study. Maternal and cord blood were collected for determining the 25(OH)D level. Questionnaires were recorded at birth and 6 months of age. Infant lung function, including tidal breathing analysis, respiratory mechanics, and forced tidal expiration, was tested at 6 months of age. Results A total of 122 mother—infant pairs were enrolled in this study, and 71 infants underwent lung function testing at 6 months of age. 25(OH)D levels in maternal and cord serum were highly correlated (r2 = 0.457, p < 0.0001). Infants with lower cord serum 25(OH)D levels (< 13.7 ng/ml) had higher resistance of respiratory system (p < 0.01) and a higher risk of a respiratory tract infection before the age of 6 months (p < 0.01). Conclusion Although a high correlation was found between maternal and cord vitamin D levels, the effect on respiratory outcome was different. Our study is the first to show that low cord 25(OH)D levels significantly relationship with poorer lung function performance and higher likelihood of a respiratory tract infection before 6 months of age."
https://openalex.org/W2555077977,"Background Recent studies have demonstrated a relationship between poor vitamin D status and respiratory infections and diarrhea among young children. Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) and diarrhea are among the two most important causes of death in under-5 children. In this paper, we examined the extent to which vitamin-D deficiency (<10 ng/ml) predicts ALRI, clinical pneumonia and diarrhea among 6 to 30 months old children. Methods We used data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of daily folic acid and/or vitamin B12 supplementation for six months in 6 to 30 months old children conducted in Delhi, India. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the associations between vitamin-D deficiency and episodes of ALRI, clinical pneumonia and diarrhea. Results Of the 960 subjects who had vitamin-D concentrations measured, 331(34.5%) were vitamin-D deficient. We found, after controlling for relevant potential confounders (age, sex, breastfeeding status, wasting, stunting, underweight, anemia status and season), that the risk of ALRI was significantly higher among vitamin-D deficient (OR 1.26; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.55) compared to vitamin-D-replete children in the six months follow-up period. Vitamin-D status was not associated with episodes of diarrhea or clinical pneumonia. Conclusion Vitamin-D deficiency is common in young children in New Delhi and is associated with a higher risk of ALRI. The role of vitamin D in Indian children needs to be elucidated in further studies."

More recently Araliopsis Engl., Diphasia, Diphasiopsis, Oricia, Teclea, and Toddaliopsis have been incorporated into the genus Vepris, while Toddalia and Fagaropsis have continued to be recognized as closely related. For this study, sequence data of one non-coding chloroplast region (trnL-F) and one nuclear region (ITS) and various morphological characters, based on Mziray's taxonomic studies were examined to try to elucidate these relationships. This study found that the taxa Diphasia, Diphasiopsis, Oricia, Teclea, Toddaliopsis, Vepris, Toddalia eugeniifolia Engl. and Toddalia glomerata F. Hoffm. form a monophyletic group. Due to the amount of intrageneric and intraspecific variation, species delimitations were difficult to determine; however, these genera should be united into Vepris. The analyses also confirmed that Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam., Zanthoxylon sp. and Fagaropsis angolensis (Engl.) H.M. Gardner are the closest relatives to this group."

Although hundreds of genes have been reported to be associated with nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL), GJB2, GJB6, SLC26A4, and mitochondrial (mt) MT-RNR1 and MTTS are the major contributors. In order to provide a faster, more comprehensive and cost effective assay, we constructed a DNA fluidic array, CapitalBioMiamiOtoArray, for the detection of sequence variants in five genes that are common in most populations of European descent.

https://openalex.org/W2592828389,"Aqueous humour (AH) is an important biologic fluid that maintains normal intraocular pressure and contains proteins that regulate the homeostasis of ocular tissues. Any alterations in the protein compositions are correlated to the pathogenesis of various ocular disorders. In recent years, gender-based medicine has emerged as an important research focus considering the prevalence of certain diseases, which are higher in a particular sex. Nevertheless, the inter-gender variations in the AH proteome are unknown. Therefore, this study endeavoured to characterize the AH proteome to assess the differences between genders. Thirty AH samples of patients who underwent cataract surgery were categorized according to their gender. Label-free quantitative discovery mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy was employed to characterize the AH proteome. A total of 147 proteins were identified with a false discovery rate of less than 1% and only the top 10 major AH proteins make up almost 90% of the total identified proteins. A large number of proteins identified were correlated to defence, immune and inflammatory mechanisms, and response to wounding. Four proteins were found to be differentially abundant between the genders, comprising SERPINF1, SERPINA3, SERPING1 and PTGDS. The findings emerging from our study provide the first insight into the gender-based proteome differences in the AH and also highlight the importance in considering potential sex-dependent changes in the proteome of ocular pathologies in future studies employing the AH."
https://openalex.org/W2594193766,"Fingolimod is an oral sphingosine-1-phosphate-receptor modulator which reduces the recirculation of immune cells and may also directly target glial cells. Here we investigate effects of fingolimod on expression of astroglial glutamate transporters under pro-inflammatory conditions. In astrocyte cell culture, the addition of pro-inflammatory cytokines led to a significant downregulation of glutamate transporters glutamate transporter-1 (slc1a2/SLC1A2) and glutamate aspartate transporter (slc1a3/SLC1A3) expression on the mRNA or protein level. In this setting, the direct application of fingolimod-1 phosphate (F1P) on astrocytes did not change expression levels of slc1a2 and slc1a3 mRNA. The analysis of both transporters on the protein level by Western Blot and immunocytochemistry did also not reveal any effect of F1P. On a functional level, the addition of conditioned supernatants from F1P treated astrocytes to neuronal cell culture did not result in increased neurite growth. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis as a model of multiple sclerosis, fingolimod treatment reduced T cell and macrophages/microglia mediated inflammation and also diminished astrocyte activation. At the same time, fingolimod restored the reduced expression of slc1a2 and slc1a3 in the inflamed spinal cord on the mRNA level and of SLC1A2 and SLC1A3 on the protein level, presumably via indirect, anti-inflammatory mechanisms. These findings provide further evidence for a predominantly peripheral effect of the compound in neuroinflammation."

We present here the first complete in situ kinetic analysis of the PD-1/PD-ligands/B7-1 system. Consistent with previous solution measurements, we observed higher in situ affinities for human (h) than murine (m) PD-1 interactions, stronger binding of hPD-1 to hPD-L2 than hPD-L1, and comparable binding of mPD-1 to both ligands. However, in contrast to the relatively weak solution affinities, the in situ affinities of PD-1 are as high as those of the T cell receptor for agonist pMHC and of LFA-1 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1) for ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) but significantly lower than that of the B7-1/CTLA-4 interaction, suggesting a distinct basis for PD-1- versus CTLA-4-mediated inhibition.

Male Wistar rats were fed a standard chow diet or a hypercaloric diet (metabolically disturbed rats, obese) which was supplemented with either whole common milk, milk enriched with PUFA (PUFA-M) or milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols (PUFA/P-M), at 5mL/kg body weight,having water as control. Whole milk supplementation increased initial weight gain and reduced gain in the adulthood of rats. Intake of common milk reduced cholesterol levels in non-obese rats and reduced insulin resistance in obese rats. PUFA-milk showed a decreasing effect on plasma triacylglycerol and VLDL concentrations, increasing plasma HDL concentration and reducing adipocyte size of non-obese rats, but no effect was observed in obese rats. PUFA/P-milk in obese rats resulted in greater deposition of muscle mass and mesenteric fat, with a tendency to lower LDL levels, and resulted a visceral fat accumulation in non-obese rats. Thus, whole common milk and PUFA-rich milk have shown to be beneficial in a normal metabolic condition, whereas common milk and milk enriched with PUFA and polyphenols improve metabolic effects of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2594629186,"Genome size varies widely across organisms, with no apparent tie to organismal complexity. While genome size is inherited, there is no established evolutionary model for this trait. Hypotheses have been postulated for the observed variation in genome sizes across species, most notably the effective population size hypothesis, the mutational equilibrium hypothesis, and the adaptive hypothesis. While much data has been collected on genome size, the above hypotheses have largely ignored impacts from phylogenetic relationships. In order to test these competing hypotheses, genome sizes of 87 Sophophora species were analyzed in a comparative phylogenetic approach using Pagel's parameters of evolution, Blomberg's K, Abouheif's Cmean and Moran's I. In addition to testing the mode and rate of genome size evolution in Sophophora species, the effect of number of taxa on detection of phylogenetic signal was analyzed for each of these comparative phylogenetic methods. Sophophora genome size was found to be dependent on the phylogeny, indicating that evolutionary time was important for predicting the variation among species. Genome size was found to evolve gradually on branches of the tree, with a rapid burst of change early in the phylogeny. These results suggest that Sophophora genome size has experienced gradual changes, which support the largely theoretical mutational equilibrium hypothesis. While some methods (Abouheif's Cmean and Moran's I) were found to be affected by increasing taxa numbers, more commonly used methods (λ and Blomberg's K) were found to have increasing reliability with increasing taxa number, with significantly more support with fifteen or more taxa. Our results suggest that these comparative phylogenetic methods, with adequate taxon sampling, can be a powerful way to uncover the enigma that is genome size variation through incorporation of phylogenetic relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2594084758,"Surface proteins in Gram-positive bacteria are incorporated into the cell wall through a peptide ligation reaction catalyzed by transpeptidase sortase. Six main classes (A-F) of sortase have been identified of which class A sortase is meant for housekeeping functions. The prototypic housekeeping sortase A (SaSrtA) from Staphylococcus aureus cleaves LPXTG-containing proteins at the scissile T-G peptide bond and ligates protein-LPXT to the terminal Gly residue of the nascent cross-bridge of peptidoglycan lipid II precursor. Sortase-mediated ligation (''sortagging'') of LPXTG-containing substrates and Gly-terminated nucleophiles occurs in vitro as well as in cellulo in the presence of Ca2+ and has been applied extensively for protein conjugations. Although the majority of applications emanate from SaSrtA, low catalytic efficiency, LPXTG specificity restriction, and Ca2+ requirement (particularly for in cellulo applications) remain a drawback. Given that Gram-positive bacteria genomes encode a variety of sortases, natural sortase mining can be a viable complementary approach akin to engineering of wildtype SaSrtA. Here, we describe the structure and specificity of a new class E sortase (SavSrtE) annotated to perform housekeeping roles in Streptomyces avermitilis. Biochemical experiments define the attributes of an optimum peptide substrate, demonstrate Ca2+-independent activity, and provide insights about contrasting functional characteristics of SavSrtE and SaSrtA. Crystal structure, substrate docking, and mutagenesis experiments have identified a critical residue that dictates the preference for a non-canonical LAXTG recognition motif over LPXTG. These results have implications for rational tailoring of substrate tolerance in sortases. Besides, Ca2+-independent orthogonal specificity of SavSrtE is likely to expand the sortagging toolkit."
https://openalex.org/W2592360188,"In multivariate normative comparisons, a patient's profile of test scores is compared to those in a normative sample. Recently, it has been shown that these multivariate normative comparisons enhance the sensitivity of neuropsychological assessment. However, multivariate normative comparisons require multivariate normative data, which are often unavailable. In this paper, we show how a multivariate normative database can be constructed by combining healthy control group data from published neuropsychological studies. We show that three issues should be addressed to construct a multivariate normative database. First, the database may have a multilevel structure, with participants nested within studies. Second, not all tests are administered in every study, so many data may be missing. Third, a patient should be compared to controls of similar age, gender and educational background rather than to the entire normative sample. To address these issues, we propose a multilevel approach for multivariate normative comparisons that accounts for missing data and includes covariates for age, gender and educational background. Simulations show that this approach controls the number of false positives and has high sensitivity to detect genuine deviations from the norm. An empirical example is provided. Implications for other domains than neuropsychology are also discussed. To facilitate broader adoption of these methods, we provide code implementing the entire analysis in the open source software package R."

The phylogeography, population genetic structure and historical demography of this species in the East Asia were examined by using partial sequences of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S rRNA in mitochondrial DNA. Ten populations that included 239 individuals were collected from Taiwan (Shihmen Reservoir, SMR, Mingte Reservoir, MTR and Chengching Lake Reservoir, CLR), mainland China (Taihu Lake, TLC, Min River, MRC, Jiulong River, JRC and Shenzhen Reservoir, SRC), Japan (Biwa Lake, BLJ and Kasumigaura Lake, KLJ) and Korea (Han River, HRK). The nucleotide diversity (π) of all individuals was 0.01134, with values ranging from 0.0089 (BLJ, Japan) to 0.01425 (MTR, Taiwan). A total of 83 haplotypes were obtained, and the haplotypes were divided into 2 main lineages: lineage A included the specimens from BLJ, KLJ, CLR, MTR, TLC, MRC and JRC, and lineage B comprised the ones from HRK, SRC, SMR, MTR, TLC, MRC and JRC. Lineage A could be further divided two sub-lineages (A1 and A2). Individuals of lineage A2 were only from TLC. Demographic expansion was observed in each lineage, starting within the second-to-latest interglacial period for lineage A and within the last glacial period for lineage B. All FST values among the ten populations were significantly different, except for the values between MRC and JRC, and SMR and SRC. The phylogeography and genetic structure of M. nipponense in East Asia might be influenced by Pleistocene glacial cycles, lake isolation and human introduction. The possible dispersal routes of M. nipponense in the East Asia were also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2590839097,"Water radiolysis by low-energy carbon projectiles is studied by first-principles molecular dynamics. Carbon projectiles of kinetic energies between 175 eV and 2.8 keV are shot across liquid water. Apart from translational, rotational and vibrational excitation, they produce water dissociation. The most abundant products are H and OH fragments. We find that the maximum spatial production of radiolysis products, not only occurs at low velocities, but also well below the maximum of energy deposition, reaching one H every 5 Ang at the lowest speed studied (1 Bohr/fs), dissociative collisions being more significant at low velocity while the amount of energy required to dissociate water is constant and much smaller than the projectile's energy. A substantial fraction of the energy transferred to fragments, especially for high velocity projectiles, is in the form of kinetic energy, such fragments becoming secondary projectiles themselves. High velocity projectiles give rise to well-defined binary collisions, which should be amenable to binary approximations. This is not the case for lower velocities, where multiple collision events are observed. H secondary projectiles tend to move as radicals at high velocity, as cations when slower. We observe the generation of new species such as hydrogen peroxide and formic acid. The former occurs when an O radical created in the collision process attacks a water molecule at the O site. The latter when the C projectile is completely stopped and reacts with two water molecules."

In this study, DNA hotspots were detected in fossilized eggshell fragments of ratites (dated ≥25000 years B.P. by radiocarbon dating) using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). DNA was isolated from five eggshell fragments and a 43 base pair (bp) sequence of a 16S rRNA mitochondrial-conserved region was successfully amplified and sequenced from one of the samples. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequence revealed a 92% identity of the fossil eggshells to Struthio camelus and their position basal to other palaeognaths, consistent with the vicariant speciation model. Our study provides the first molecular evidence for the presence of ostriches in India, complementing the continental drift theory of biogeographical movement of ostriches in India, and opening up a new window into the evolutionary history of ratites."

Among this record are nine localities that have produced either dinosaur embryos, eggs or eggshell fragments. Herein, we describe and identify the first crocodiloid morphotype eggs and eggshells from the Lourinhã Formation, from five occurrences. One clutch from Cambelas, composed of 13 eggs, eggshell fragments from Casal da Rola and Peralta, one crushed egg and eggshells from Paimogo North, and four crushed eggs as well as eggshell fragments from Paimogo South. We observed and confirmed diagnostic morphological characters for crocodiloid eggshells and which are consistent with a crocodylomorph affinity, such as the ellipsoidal shape, wedge-shaped shell units, triangular extinction under cross-polarized light, and tabular ultrastructure. This material is distinctive enough to propose two new ootaxa within the oofamily Krokolithidae, Suchoolithus portucalensis, oogen. and oosp. nov., for the material from Cambelas, the most complete clutch known for crocodiloid eggs, and Krokolithes dinophilus, oosp. nov., for the remaining material. These are the oldest crocodylomorph eggs known, extending the fossil record for this group to the Late Jurassic. Furthermore, except for the clutch from Cambelas, the material was found with theropod eggs and nests, in the other four occurrences, which seem to suggest some form of biological relationship, still unclear at this point."

https://openalex.org/W2593747814,"Background Lateral temporal neural measures (Na and T-complex Ta and Tb) of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) index maturation of auditory/speech processing. These measures are also sensitive to language experience in adults. This paper examined neural responses to a vowel sound at temporal electrodes in four- to five-year-old Spanish-English bilinguals and English monolinguals and in five- to six-year-old Turkish-German bilinguals and German monolinguals. The goal was to determine whether obligatory AEPs at temporal electrode sites were modulated by language experience. Language experience was defined in terms of monolingual versus bilingual status as well as the amount and quality of the bilingual language experience. Method AEPs were recorded at left and right temporal electrode sites to a 250-ms vowel [Ɛ] from 20 monolingual (American)-English and 18 Spanish-English children from New York City, and from 11 Turkish-German and 13 monolingual German children from Ulm, Germany. Language background information and standardized verbal and non-verbal test scores were obtained for the children. Results The results revealed differences in temporal AEPs (Na and Ta of the T-complex) between monolingual and bilingual children. Specifically, bilingual children showed smaller and/or later peak amplitudes than the monolingual groups. Ta-amplitude distinguished monolingual and bilingual children best at right electrode sites for both the German and American groups. Amount of experience and type of experience with the target language (English and German) influenced processing. Conclusions The finding of reduced amplitudes at the Ta latency for bilingual compared to monolingual children indicates that language specific experience, and not simply maturational factors, influences development of the neural processes underlying the Ta AEP, and suggests that lateral temporal cortex has an important role in language-specific speech perception development."
https://openalex.org/W2591823482,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can damage DNA, proteins, and lipids, so cells have antioxidant systems that regulate ROS. In many bacteria, a dedicated peroxiredoxin reductase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase subunit F (AhpF), catalyzes the rapid reduction of the redox-active disulfide center of the antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin (AhpC) to detoxify ROS such as hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxide, and peroxynitrite. AhpF is a flexible multidomain protein that enables a series of electron transfers among the redox centers by accepting reducing equivalents from NADH. A flexible linker connecting the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of AhpF suggests that the enzyme adopts a large-scale domain motion that alternates between the closed and open states to shuttle electrons from the CTD via the NTD to AhpC. Here, we conducted comprehensive mutational, biochemical, and biophysical analyses to gain insights into the role of the flexible linker and the residues critical for the domain motions of Escherichia coli AhpF (EcAhpF) during electron transfer. Small-angle X-ray scattering studies of linker mutants revealed that a group of charged residues, 200EKR202, is crucial for the swiveling motion of the NTD. Moreover, NADH binding significantly affected EcAhpF flexibility and the movement of the NTD relative to the CTD. The mutants also exhibited a decrease in H2O2 reduction by the AhpF-AhpC ensemble. We propose that a concerted movement involving the NTD, C-terminal NADH, and FAD domains, and the flexible linker between them is essential for optimal intra-domain cross-talk and for efficient electron transfer to the redox partner AhpC required for peroxidation.

In AhpF crystal structures, the linker residues 197–209 adopt a loop-helix structure, with residues Lys201-Lys209 and Arg202-Lys209 of EcAhpF (14.Dip P.V. Kamariah N. Subramanian Manimekalai M.S.

So far, detailed insight into (i) the precise role of the linker and its residues facilitating the flexibility for domain motion of the NTD, (ii) the mode of domain arrangement of NTD with respect to specific functional states, and (iii) the essential role of the linker flexibility on the peroxidase catalytic cycle are missing. To address these questions and to gain deeper insight into the role of the linker on the structural flexibility, we carried out mutational, biochemical, and biophysical analyses on the EcAhpF linker region, in particular the charged amino acids 200EKR202, which might come in proximity to the CTD and provide interactions. By generating and analyzing the single, double, and triple mutations EcAhpF(E200A), EcAhpF(K201A), EcAhpF(R202A), EcAhpF(K201A/R202A), and EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A), we identified that residues Glu200, Lys201, and Arg202 are essential for function, and that these residues may act as a hinge for NTD movements. Moreover, the significant hampering in structural flexibility is deduced due not merely to the linker mutations but also due to the presence of NADH, indicating a substrate-induced cross-talk, which might favor EcAhpF to adopt a closed state. Overall, the flexible linker is crucial to maintain the rapid equilibrium of NTD motion, including the upwards movements of the NTD for an efficient electron-transfer reaction to finally regenerate AhpC for peroxide reduction.

A closer look at the linker regions highlights conformational differences for the residues 197TGAEKR202, which are poorly ordered and have high B-factors in both the structures (Fig. 1B). By contrast, the B-factors are low for the helix region 203AAEELNK209 of the linker. A group of charged residues, 200EKR202, lies at the interface of the flexible loop that contains the small side chain residues 197TGA199 and helix 203AAEELNK209. Therefore, we hypothesized that 200EKR202 may play a role as a mechanical swivel allowing the NTD to move up and down. To verify our proposal, we have generated the mutants, EcAhpF(E200A), EcAhpF(K201A), EcAhpF(R202A), EcAhpF(K201A/R202A), and EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A), wherein the 200EKR202 residues are mutated to alanine. To unravel the effect of the linker on the conformation flexibility of EcAhpF in solution, SAXS experiments were performed with the genetically engineered, expressed, and purified linker mutants (Fig. 2A). SAXS patterns of the various linker mutants were recorded at three different concentrations between 2 and 6 mg/ml (Fig. 2, B–F).

The derived Rg values were 39.7, 39.8, 39.2, 39.6, and 39.9 Å for the EcAhpF(E200A), EcAhpF(K201A), EcAhpF(R202A), EcAhpF(K201A/R202A), and EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A) mutants, respectively (Table 1). The P(r) function showed a single peak with a small tail (Fig. 2G) and the maximum particle dimension (Dmax) values were calculated to be 130.7, 130.3, 130.1, 130.1, and 130.3 Å for EcAhpF(E200A), EcAhpF(K201A), EcAhpF(R202A), EcAhpF(K201A/R202A), and EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A), respectively (Table 1) (22.Svergun D. Determination of the regularization parameter in indirect-transform methods using perceptual criteria.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2945) Google Scholar). The Rg values extracted from the P(r) function are in agreement with the Rg values extracted from the Guinier region. The estimated Rg, Dmax, and molecular mass of the linker mutants are comparable with the ones of WT EcAhpF (39.3 and 129.5 Å; Table 1) (15.Kamariah N. Manimekalai M.S. Nartey W. Eisenhaber F.

Acta. 2015; 1847: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), indicating that the linker mutants do not affect the overall structural integrity and dimeric form of the protein in solution.Table 1Data collection and scattering derived parameters for EcAhpF linker mutants Open table in a new tab To further elucidate the role of the linker mutants on protein flexibility, the normalized Kratky- and Porod-Debye plots were derived and compared with that of WT EcAhpF as well as to the compact protein lysozyme (23.Kikhney A.G.

Characterizing flexible and intrinsically unstructured biological macromolecules by SAS using the Porod-Debye law.Biopolymers. 2011; 95: 559-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). For clarity, the comparison between the WT EcAhpF, EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A), and lysozyme, is shown in Fig. 3B. Visual inspection of the normalized Kratky plot reveals a bell-shaped profile for lysozyme, which vanishes for both the WT EcAhpF and the linker mutants demonstrating their flexibility in solution (23.Kikhney A.G.

Acta. 2015; 1847: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). Moreover, no significant difference was noticed in the normalized Kratky profiles for the linker mutants (Fig. 3A). However, the profile of the mutants showed a slight inwards shift when compared with WT EcAhpF (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting an alteration in structural flexibility of the mutants. In addition, the absence of a plateau at low q-angles in the Porod-Debey plot supports the continued flexibility of the linker mutants (Fig. 3C). As in the normalized Kratky plot, the Porod-Debey plots confirm a slightly higher flexibility of WT EcAhpF compared with the mutants (Fig. 3C). To investigate the content of a compact or extended form of the mutants, the theoretical scattering curves were computed and compared with the experimental data using CRYSOL (25.Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. CRYSOL: a program to evaluate X-ray solution scattering of biological macromolecules from atomic coordinates.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2764) Google Scholar). In the case of a 100% compact dimer of EcAhpF(E200A), EcAhpF(K201A), EcAhpF(R202A), EcAhpF(K201A/R202A), and EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A), χ2 values of 1.92, 2.44, 2.08, 1.98, and 1.77, respectively, were computed. In addition, χ2 values of 2.18, 2.53, 2.09, 2.38, and 2.01 were calculated for the respective mutants for an extended dimer (Table 2). However, a best fit with χ2 values of 1.25, 1.25, 0.89, 1.12, and 0.84 were achieved for EcAhpF(E200A), EcAhpF(K201A), EcAhpF(R202A), EcAhpF(K201A/R202A), and EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A), respectively, when a mixture of a compact (∼60%) and extended (∼40%) conformation were present using OLIGOMER (26.Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H.J. Svergun D.I. PRIMUS: Windows-PC based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2341) Google Scholar) (Table 2, Fig. 3D). The result is in agreement with the one determined for WT EcAhpF, which showed a best fit (χ2 = 0.63) in the presence of an equal mixture of compact (∼49%) and extended (∼51%) conformations (Table 2) (15.Kamariah N. Manimekalai M.S. Nartey W. Eisenhaber F. Eisenhaber B. Grüber G.

Acta. 2015; 1847: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When compared with WT EcAhpF, the compact conformation of the linker EcAhpF mutants is slightly preferred over the extended conformation.Table 2Fitting between the experimental scattering data of various EcAhpF forms and the calculated scattering data from the atomic structure of the compact dimeric StAhpF and extended dimeric EcAhpF structures using CRYSOLSampleCompact StAhpFExtended EcAhpFMixture (χ2) (closed:extended)χ2%WT AhpF1.781.640.63 (49:51)E200A1.922.181.25 (61:39)K201A2.442.531.25 (59:41)R202A2.082.090.89 (58:42)K201A/R202A1.982.381.12 (61:38)E200A/K201A/R202A1.772.010.84 (58:42) Open table in a new tab To understand the effect of NADH on the EcAhpF linker mutants, SAXS data have been collected for EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A), EcAhpF(K201KA/R202A), and EcAhpF(R202A) at three protein concentrations in the presence of 1 mm NADH. The scattering profiles of the three above mentioned mutants in the presence of NADH are shown in Fig. 4, A–C. The Rg and Dmax values of the single EcAhpF(R202A) mutant were 37.8 and 120 Å, respectively, which is comparable with that of NADH-bound EcAhpF (37.3 and 120 Å; Table 3 (15.Kamariah N.

Acta. 2015; 1847: 1139-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). However, a significant decrease in the Rg and Dmax values were observed for the double and triple mutants EcAhpF(K201A/R202A) (Rg = 36.5 Å and Dmax = 118 Å) and EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A) (Rg = 35.5 Å and Dmax = 110 Å), respectively (Table 3; Fig. 4D).Table 3The SAXS derived parameters for the WT EcAhpF, EcAhpF(R202A), EcAhpF(K201A/R201A), and EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A) in the presence of NADHSample (1 mm NADH)Guinier RgReal space RgDmaxCalculated molecular mass (from Porod invariant)ÅkDaR202A37.8 ± 0.538.1 ± 0.2120 ± 498 ± 10K201A/R202A36.5 ± 0.437.3 ± 0.2118 ± 3100 ± 10E200A/K201A/R202A35.5 ± 0.335.9 ± 0.1110 ± 3100 ± 10WT AhpF37.2 ± 138.9 ± 0.3120 ± 299 ± 10 Open table in a new tab In addition, the linker mutants showed a significant difference in their normalized Kratky curves, which started to shift progressively inwards from a single to the triple mutant (Fig. 5A). The Porod-Debey plot also demonstrated the gradual decrease in the slope as q increases, for EcAhpF(R202A) and EcAhpF(K201A/R202A). Interestingly, a plateau was observed for the EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A) triple mutant (Fig. 5B). These results clearly demonstrate a significant decrease in the structural flexibility of linker mutants in the presence of NADH. Furthermore, the flexibility of the EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A) is affected considerably followed by the EcAhpF(K201A/R202A) and EcAhpF(R202A) mutants. In comparison, the substrate-free and NADH-bound forms of WT EcAhpF showed a similar normalized Kratky- and Porod-Debye profile, revealing no alteration in their protein flexibility (15.Kamariah N.

PRIMUS: Windows-PC based system for small-angle scattering data analysis.J. Appl.

The fit marginally increased with χ2 values of 1.30 and 1.01, respectively, considering a mixture of compact (about 80%) and extended (about 20%) conformations present in solution (Table 4). Importantly, EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A) had a best fit with a 100% compact form in solution (χ2 = 1.1) (Fig. 5C). Because the scattering data of EcAhpF(E200A/K201A/R202A) suggested the presence of a single compact component, the solution shape was ab initio reconstructed. The averaged model (DAMMIF, Fig. 5D) had a normalized spatial discrepancy value of 0.81 ± 0.07, and r"

The raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides is considered as one of the most influential alien mesopredator species in Europe, having the potential to cause loss of local biodiversity and act as a vector for zoonotic diseases. We collared 12 animals to study their home range and habitat use in two areas with different management regimes in Estonia: in a protected natural area and in an intensively managed area. From May to October raccoon dogs inhabiting the natural area had considerably smaller home ranges compared to the managed area, 193.3ha±37.3SD and 391.9ha±292.9SD, respectively. This result contradicts somewhat earlier findings in other European raccoon dog populations, where the home range sizes in natural areas in summer and autumn period have usually been larger compared to managed areas. In both study areas raccoon dogs preferred watersides, where amphibians and other semi-aquatic prey are abundant, to other habitats available in their home ranges. We also studied movements of a raccoon dog pair in the managed study area in winter period. Due to mild weather conditions during the study period, raccoon dogs changed their resting sites quite often, covering a relatively large 599 ha area from November 2012 to January 2013, indicating the absence of usual winter lethargy during the mild winters."
https://openalex.org/W2594515085,"The effects of stocking both filter-feeding fish and piscivorous fish were compared to the effects of stocking only filter-feeding fish for suppressing algal blooms and improving water quality in the impoundment area of Xiaojiang River where catfish were dominant. Using only filter-feeding fish for algal suppression and water quality control was more effective in the short-term, but use of both filter-feeding fish and piscivorous fish was better in the long-term. Obvious suppression of phytoplankton biomass (PB) only occurred during the first 14 days regardless of the fish stocked. Adding fish to the enclosure clearly alters phytoplankton community structure and introducing piscivorous fish to an enclosure stocked with filter-feeding fish changed the relative densities of dominant algae species. While stocking filter-feeding fish decreased total nitrogen concentration by removing phytoplankton, it did not effectively decrease total phosphorus and Chlorophyll a concentrations. Introducing piscivorous fish to the enclosure weakened the relationship between nutrients and phytoplankton. Results indicate that stocking only filter-feeding fish to improve water quality and suppress phytoplankton in an impoundment area is insufficient and other technologies and means should be applied simultaneously."
