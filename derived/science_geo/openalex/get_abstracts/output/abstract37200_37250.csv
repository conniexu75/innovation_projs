https://openalex.org/W1977646528,"A so-called ""growth-associated"" or ""M phase-specific"" histone H1 kinase (H1K) has been described in a wide variety of eukaryotic cell types. In starfish oocytes, the hormone 1-methyladenine triggers synchronous meiotic divisions that are accompanied by a rapid 30-fold stimulation of H1K activity. We have substantially purified this activated enzyme and find that it is enriched for a protein of 34 kd. Quantitative immunoblotting of the column fractions with antibodies raised against p34, the product of the fission yeast cdc2 gene, revealed complete coelution of the H1K activity and a 34 kd anti-cdc2 cross-reactive protein. Starfish H1K also displayed the same apparent molecular weight, on a molecular sizing column, as the mitotically activated p13/p34/p62 protein kinase complex of HeLa cells. p13, the product of the fission yeast suc1+ gene, interacts tightly with p34 in yeast, Xenopus, and HeLa cells. H1K from starfish binds strongly to p13-Sepharose and the time course of 1-methyladenine-induced H1K activation, whether assayed in crude extract or on p13-Sepharose beads, is identical. These results indicate that a cdc2 homolog is a subunit of the M phase-specific H1K of starfish meiotic oocytes. Since this protein is also a subunit of the M-phase promoting factor (MPF) of Xenopus oocytes, we suggest that H1K and MPF are the same entity, and that histone H1 is likely to be one substrate of the pleiotropic MPF."

Hepa 1c1c7 cytosol was photoaffinity-labeled with [125I]-2-azido-3-iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin followed by immunoprecipitation, and the resulting precipitate was applied to a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoretic gel. These gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and revealed the presence of a major immunoprecipitated 90-kDa protein, and after autoradiography a radiolabeled 95-kDa protein (Ah receptor) was detected. The 90-kDa protein was determined to be the 90-kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) by western blot analysis using an antibody (AC88) previously shown to be specific for HSP90. An increase in the sedimentation of the Ah receptor on sucrose density gradients was seen upon addition of monoclonal antibody 8D3 to Hepa 1c1c7 cytosol. Monoclonal antibody 8D3 immunoprecipitates the Ah receptor from Hepa 1 cells (murine), HeLa cells (human), and rat liver cytosolic extracts, indicating that the Ah receptor is complexed with HSP90 in several mammalian species tested. These results illustrate another physicochemical property that the supergene family of soluble steroid receptors and the Ah receptor have in common."
https://openalex.org/W2088261928,"Jurkat T cell lines constitutively expressing Tax, the 40-kilodalton transactivator protein of human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), were used to investigate the mechanism by which this viral product deregulates the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor alpha gene (IL-2R alpha, Tac). Transfection of deleted forms of the IL-2R alpha promoter and in vitro DNA-binding studies revealed that a 12-base pair promoter segment, which has homology with the binding site for NF-kappa B, was required for Tax-induced activation of the IL-2R alpha promoter in vivo. An 18-base pair oligonucleotide containing this kappa B-like regulatory element proved sufficient to confer Tax inducibility upon a heterologous promoter. DNA affinity precipitation assays showed that Tax, like mitogenic stimuli, induced the expression of the 86-kilodalton cellular protein HIVEN86A, which specifically binds to the IL-2R alpha kappa B element in vitro. Furthermore, DNA/protein cross-linking studies revealed that several polypeptides interact with this sequence motif. Thus, the deregulation of IL-2R alpha gene expression encountered in HTLV-I leukemias appears to involve Tax activation of one or more cellular proteins that are normally induced by mitogens and that directly contribute to transcriptional activation of this receptor gene."
https://openalex.org/W1991037396,"A defective herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) vector, pHSVlac, has been developed that contains a transcription unit that places the Escherichia coli lacZ gene under the control of the HSV-1 immediate early 4/5 promoter. The vector pHSVlac was propagated with the HSV-1 temperature-sensitive mutant ts K as helper virus. Infection of neurons from rat superior cervical ganglia and dorsal root ganglia in primary culture resulted in stable expression of high levels of Î²-galactosidase without cell death. These HSV-1 vectors should be useful for introducing genes into postmitotic cells, such as neurons, in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2008943739,"The alpha-factor receptor is rapidly hyperphosphorylated on Thr and Ser residues in its hydrophilic C-terminal domain after cells are exposed to pheromone. Mutant receptors in which this domain is altered or removed are biologically active and bind alpha-factor with nearly normal affinity. However, cells expressing the mutant receptors are hypersensitive to pheromone action and appear to be defective in recovery from alpha-factor-induced growth arrest. Mutant receptors with partial C-terminal truncations undergo ligand-induced endocytosis, suggesting that down-regulation of receptor number is not the sole process for adaptation at the receptor level. A mutant receptor lacking the entire C-terminal domain (134 residues) does not display ligand-induced endocytosis. Genetic experiments indicate that the contribution of SST2 function to adaptation does not require the C-terminal domain of the receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2055456747,"Cell activation by phytohaemagglutinin, phorbol ester and by the supernatant of phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells induces the expression and cytopathic effects of latent human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) in vitro. The lymphocyte surface protein CD4 has been identified as a receptor for HIV-1 and binds the viral envelope glycoprotein (gp120). In the light of evidence indicating that one natural function of CD4 is as a growth factor receptor, we examined the ability of native gp120 to activate resting CD4-bearing lymphocytes. Our results indicate that gp120 has innate biological activity as a result of a specific interaction with CD4, inducing increases in intracellular levels of inositol trisphosphate and of calcium, and in interleukin-2 receptor expression and cell motility."

https://openalex.org/W2089841008,"To study the insertion of multispanning membrane proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum, we constructed novel proteins on the cDNA level by repeating, up to four times, the internal signal-anchor domain of the asialoglycoprotein receptor H1. Upon in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes, these polypeptides are indeed inserted as polytopic membrane proteins. The first hydrophobic domain functions as a signal and the second as a stop-transfer sequence, while the third initiates a second translocation process, halted again by the fourth. We were able to demonstrate that insertion occurs sequentially, starting with the first apolar segment from the amino terminus. By replacing the original signal-anchor domains by a mutant sequence not recognized by signal recognition particle (SRP), it was shown that only the first hydrophobic domain needs to be a signal sequence and that the second translocation event does not require SRP."
https://openalex.org/W2004785999,"An in vivo transcriptional activator, the immediate early protein (IE) of pseudorabies virus, potentiates the activity of the major late promoter in a reconstituted chromatin assembly system where the assembly of preinitiation complexes is in competition with the assembly of promoter sequences within nucleosomes. IE function requires the simultaneous action of TFIID and results in the formation of stable preinitiation complexes within nucleosome-assembled templates. IE is unable to reverse nucleosome-mediated repression, once established, or to further increase the activity of previously activated templates. These results indicate that IE stimulates TFIID binding to promoter sequences, effectively competing with nucleosomes, during chromatin reconstitution. The specific implications for IE function in vivo and the general implications for cellular gene regulation are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1544439362,"Abstract In partially purified preparations of the vacuolar ATPase from Neurospora crassa, the two most prominent components are polypeptides of Mr = 70,000 and 60,000. We previously reported the isolation of the gene vma-1, which encodes the Mr = 70,000 polypeptide, and presented evidence that the polypeptide contains the site of ATP hydrolysis (Bowman, E. J., Tenney, K., and Bowman, B. J. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 13994-14001). We now report the isolation of a gene (designated vma-2), that encodes the Mr = 60,000 polypeptide. Analysis of the DNA sequence shows that the polypeptide has 513 amino acids and a molecular mass of 56,808 daltons (and will thus be referred to as the 57-kDa polypeptide). It is fairly rich in polar amino acids and has no apparent membrane-spanning domains. The vma-2 gene contains five short introns (55-71 bases), all clustered in the 5' end of the coding region. The gene maps to the right arm of linkage group II, near 5 S RNA gene 3. Thus, it is unlinked to vma-1 and to other known ATPase genes in N. crassa. The 57-kDa polypeptide shows 25% amino acid sequence identity with the vma-1 gene product. It shows essentially the same degree of similarity (25-28%) to both the alpha and beta subunits of F0F1 ATPases. Analysis of specific regions of the 57-kDa polypeptide, however, suggests it may have a function like that of the alpha subunit in F0F1 ATPases. The data indicate that all four types of ATPase polypeptides have evolved from a common ancestor and that the vacuolar-type ATPases have a structure surprisingly similar to that of the F0F1 ATPases."

https://openalex.org/W2144846481,"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to characterize the organic and mineral phases present during the induction of mineral formation by collagenase-released matrix vesicles (CRMV) during incubation in a synthetic cartilage lymph in vitro. CRMV mineralization, which occurs in the absence of alkaline phosphatase organic phosphate substrates, is characterized by an initial short lag period of limited Ca2+ accumulation, followed by a period of rapid Ca2+ uptake, and finally, by a plateau period during which Ca2+ accumulation continued at a slower rate. FTIR spectra taken at timed intervals during the induction of mineralization revealed the presence of absorptions characteristic of protein, phospholipid, and mineral components in the CRMV. These became progressively more intense with time. To reveal underlying changes occurring during the successive stages of Ca2+ accumulation, FTIR spectra of nascent (or demineralized) CRMV were computer-subtracted from subsequent spectra, nulling on the C-H stretch modes characteristic of the lipid acyl chains. These difference spectra showed little change during early Ca2+ loading, revealing that mineral ions initially accumulated in a form similar to that present in nascent matrix vesicles (MV). During the period of rapid Ca2+ uptake prior to appearance of crystalline mineral, difference spectra revealed subtle changes in the carbonyl and amide nitrogen stretch modes indicative of protein conformational changes. The first definable mineral phase appeared late in the rapid Ca2+ uptake period and was a distinct, crystalline octacalcium phosphate (OCP)-like phase. With time, the OCP-like precursor became more apatitic in character. There was no evidence that any amorphous calcium phosphate phase formed during the MV mineralization sequence. The mature MV mineral phase closely resembled hydroxyapatite formed via an OCP precursor and was similar to other biological apatites that show a substantial incorporation of carbonate."
https://openalex.org/W1514923395,"Coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase is a multisubunit complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with lesions in cytochromes b, c1, the non-heme iron protein, and the noncatalytic subunits have been used to study several aspects of the assembly of the complex. Strains with mutations in single subunits exhibit a variety of different phenotypes. Mutants in the 17-kDa (core 3) subunit grow normally on a nonfermentable substrate indicating that this component is not essential for either enzymatic activity or assembly of the enzyme. Mutations in all the other subunits express a respiratory-deficient phenotype and the absence of detectable enzyme activity. Among the respiratory-defective strains, some have mature cytochrome b (non-heme iron protein and cytochrome c1 mutants), while other mutants lack spectrally detectable cytochrome b and have reduced levels of the apoprotein (mutants in the 44-, 40-, 14-, and 11-kDa core subunits). Mutations in single subunits exert different effects on the concentrations of their partner proteins. These may be summarized as follows: 1) No substantial loss in the 44- or 40-kDa core subunits is seen in single mutants; 2) the concentration of cytochrome c1 is also relatively unaffected by mutations in the other subunits except for the cytochrome b mutant which has 60% of the wild type level of cytochrome c1; 3) all the single mutants have only 15-20% of the normal amount of non-heme iron protein; 4) mutations in the non-heme iron protein have no appreciable effect on the concentrations of the other subunits; 5) mutations in single subunits cause parallel decreases in the concentrations of cytochrome b, the 14-, and the 11-kDa subunits. These results indicate that the synthesis or stability of a subset of subunits depends on the presence of other subunit polypeptides of the complex. At present we favor the idea that the observed changes in the concentrations of some subunits are due to higher turnover rates of the proteins in a partially assembled complex. Based on the mutant phenotypes, a tentative model for the assembly of coenzyme QH2-cytochrome c reductase is proposed. According to this model it is envisioned that the subunits interact with one another in the lipid bilayer. Maturation of apocytochrome b occurs after it is assembled with the nonstructural subunits to form a core structure. This intermediate complex interacts with the non-heme iron protein to form the active holoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2095346626,"A fraction of the 28S ribosomal genes in certain insect species is interrupted by the insertion elements R1 and R2. These two elements from the silkworm Bombyx mori (R1Bm and R2Bm) are retrotransposons capable of transposing in a highly sequence-specific manner. We report here the functional expression in E. coli of the entire single open reading frame of R2Bm and show that it encodes a double-stranded endo-nuclease (integrase) that can specifically cleave the 28S gene at the R2 insertion site. The resulting cleavage is a 4 bp staggered 5' overhang. Deletion analysis of the 28S gene revealed that the DNA sequence required for specific cleavage is asymmetric with respect to the actual insertion (cleavage) site, with fewer than 10 bp required at one side and at least 24 bp at the other side of the site. A model is proposed based on these and previous data to account for the sequence-specific integration of the R2 retrotransposon."
https://openalex.org/W1515512367,"Rhodopsin kinase was purified to near homogeneity by affinity binding to light-exposed rod cell outer segment membranes, followed by DEAE-cellulose and hydroxyapatite chromatography. This resulted in a 1055-fold purification of highly active rhodopsin kinase with an overall recovery of 19%. Rhodopsin kinase is a single polypeptide chain with Mr = 67,000-70,000 as determined by gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. The kinetic parameters of the enzyme for freshly bleached rhodopsin are Km = 4 microM and Vmax = 700 nmol/min/mg whereas for ATP Km = 2 microM (which is a low value for kinases generally, and about 20 times lower than comparable measurements for a kinase of a similar type, the beta-adrenergic-receptor kinase (Benovic, J.L., Mayor, F. Jr., Staniszewski, C., Lefkowitz, R.J., and Caron, M.G. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9026-9032). GTP, on the other hand, is a very poor substrate (Km = 1 mM, Vmax = 10 nmol/min/mg). Rhodopsin kinase is competitively inhibited by adenosine and its mono- and diphosphate derivatives, but not by most other adenosine derivatives. Based upon measurements with 28 nucleotide derivatives, the ATP-binding site of rhodopsin kinase appears to have more specific requirements than that for other kinases. Compounds such as cGMP, inositol trisphosphate, and others that change concentration during exposure of rod cells to light have only minor inhibitory effects on the kinase activity, with the exception of inositol monophosphate, which can activate the kinase about 20% at 50-100 microM. Rhodopsin kinase has been difficult to store with retention of activity, but can be successfully stored frozen at -20 degrees C in 20% adonitol."
https://openalex.org/W2030977214,"We have identified a murine T lymphocyte clone that apparently lacks diacylglycerol- and phospholipid-activated protein kinase C (PKC): cell extracts do not display phosphatidylserine, Ca2+, or phorbol ester-dependent phosphotransferase activity; the enzyme was not detected in immunoblots with PKC-specific antibodies; phorbol ester binding sites are not detectable in intact cells; and activators of PKC do not stimulate proliferation or Na+/H+ exchange in intact cells. Only PKC beta mRNA was detected in normal murine T lymphocytes. The mutant T lymphocytes contained amounts of 4.4 kb PKC beta message similar to those in normal murine lymphocytes, but the 2.9 kb and 1.2 kb messages found in normal lymphocytes were barely detectable. No abnormalities were detected on Southern analysis, suggesting that the abnormality may be at the level of message splicing or stability. Since PKC-deficient cells proliferate in response to the T lymphocyte growth factor, interleukin-2, we conclude that activation of PKC is not essential for the growth-promoting action of interleukin-2."
https://openalex.org/W1966515357,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) plays a critical role in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes, insulin elicits the rapid release of LPL through mechanisms that are independent of energy metabolism and protein synthesis. Some of the metabolic actions of insulin may be mediated by the activation of a specific phospholipase that hydrolyzes a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecule. The insulin-sensitive glycosyl-PI is structurally similar to the glycolipid membrane anchor of a number of proteins. LPL appears to be anchored to the 3T3-L1 cell surface by glycosyl-PI, and its rapid release by insulin may be due to activation of a glycosyl-PI-specific phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1588963749,"We have examined the glycosylation of the basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) receptor to determine whether carbohydrates contribute to receptor structure and function. Using a combination of cross-linking and radioreceptor assays, we demonstrated that the two bFGF receptors in baby hamster kidney cells have protein cores of 100 and 125 kDa. They are glycosylated to high mannose forms of 115 and 140 kDa and further processed to their mature forms of 130 and 150 kDa. Because peptide:N-glycosidase F, but not endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosamidase can reduce the size of the bFGF receptors, the carbohydrate residues of the receptor appear all N-linked. The inability of deglycosylated receptors to bind 125I-bFGF supports the notion that the carbohydrate residues are required for receptor function. Furthermore, the capacity of the wheat germ agglutinin lectin to inhibit 125I-bFGF binding and the biological activity of bFGF suggests that N-acetylglucosamine residues are functionally significant components of the receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2005476691,"The cytochrome c oxidase subunit III (COIII) transcript of T. brucei is extensively edited by the addition and deletion of uridines. We have identified partially edited COIII RNAs; they have unedited 5' and edited 3' regions. Transcripts with edited 5' but unedited 3' regions were not detected. The partially edited RNAs may be editing intermediates. The junctions of unedited and edited sequences in cDNAs differ from both the DNA and fully edited mRNA sequences over a multinucleotide region. The partially edited RNAs could arise from several processes, but it seems likely that editing proceeds in the 3' to 5' direction."
https://openalex.org/W1578034405,"The ability of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) to elevate cellular levels of mRNA for beta-subunit of luteinizing hormone (LH) has been examined in monolayer cultures from rat pituitary. Low concentrations of GnRH (100 pM) induced a 6.8-fold increase in LH-beta mRNA, while higher concentrations of GnRH were less effective. The low concentrations of GnRH (100 pM) did not result in altered GnRH receptor levels (92 +/- 12% compared to controls) after 24 h treatment but did increase protein kinase C activity to 249 +/- 16%. The protein kinase C activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, at concentrations (2-20 nM) which did not deplete protein kinase C, stimulated LH-beta mRNA levels 2-5-fold after 24 h. Higher concentrations of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which depleted protein kinase C activity, substantially reduced the ability of 100 pM GnRH to stimulate increases in LH-beta mRNA levels. As previously observed, protein kinase C-depleted cells exhibited normal LH release in response to GnRH stimulation. These studies demonstrate that low concentrations of GnRH may have an important role in regulation of gonadotropin biosynthesis. Furthermore, the results suggest that activation of protein kinase C is sufficient to stimulate increases in LH-beta mRNA levels and that protein kinase C is necessary for normal GnRH stimulation of LH-beta mRNA levels. Accordingly, we postulate that protein kinase C may mediate the action of GnRH on LH-beta mRNA levels."
https://openalex.org/W2072653574,"An in vitro assay was developed to study the positive factors that regulate the onset of DNA replication during the mammalian cell cycle. Extracts prepared from cells at defined positions in the cell cycle were used to examine the replication of SV40 DNA in a cell free system. Extracts prepared from S phase cells were ten times more efficient at initiating replication at the SV40 origin than were extracts from G1 cells, whereas elongation rates were similar in G1 and S reactions. At a discrete point in the cell cycle, just before the cell's entry into S, an activity appeared that was required, in conjunction with SV40 T antigen, for site specific initiation at the SV40 origin. This factor had a role in unwinding DNA at the replication origin."
https://openalex.org/W1596634612,"Previous studies indicate that free cholesterol moves passively between high density lipoprotein (HDL) and cell plasma membranes by uncatalyzed diffusion of cholesterol molecules in the extracellular aqueous phase. By this mechanism, the rate constants for free cholesterol influx (Cli) and efflux (ke) should not be very sensitive to the free cholesterol content of cells or HDL. Thus, at a given HDL concentration, the unidirectional influx and efflux of cholesterol mass (Fi, Fe) should be proportional to the cholesterol content of HDL and cells, respectively, and net efflux of cholesterol mass (Fe-Fi greater than 0) should occur when either cells are enriched with cholesterol or HDL is depleted of cholesterol. We have examined the influence of cell and HDL free cholesterol contents on the bidirectional flux of free cholesterol between HDL and human fibroblasts and also attempted to detect some dependence of flux on the binding of HDL to the cells. In the range of HDL concentrations from 1 to 1000 micrograms of protein/ml, ke for cell free cholesterol approximately doubled for every 10-fold increase in HDL concentration, reaching 0.04 h-1 at 1000 micrograms of HDL/ml. ke and Cli were not influenced by the doubling of fibroblast free cholesterol content (from 31 +/- 5 to 62 +/- 13 micrograms of cholesterol/mg of protein). There was an approximate exchange of cholesterol between HDL and the unenriched fibroblasts (e.g. at [HDL] = 100 micrograms/ml, Fe and Fi = 3.2 and 3.0 micrograms of cholesterol/[4 h.mg of cell protein], respectively). In contrast, there was substantial net efflux from the enriched cells (at [HDL] = 100 micrograms/ml, Fe and Fi = 5.5 and 3.1 micrograms of cholesterol/[4 h.mg of cell protein], respectively). The rate constants for cholesterol flux were not influenced by changing the free cholesterol content of HDL, so that there was net efflux of cell cholesterol in the presence of cholesterol-depleted HDL and net influx from cholesterol-rich HDL. The Kd of HDL binding to fibroblasts was reduced from 1.7 to 0.9 micrograms/ml by the enrichment of the cells with free cholesterol; this increase in affinity for HDL was not reflected in enhanced rate constants for cholesterol flux. The inhibition of specific HDL binding by treatment of the lipoprotein with dimethyl suberimidate did not affect cholesterol flux using either control or cholesterol-rich cells at any HDL concentration in the range 1-1000 micrograms/ml. The above results are consistent with the concept that net movement of free cholesterol between cells and HDL occurs by passive, mass-action effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1486210853,"The regulation of lipoprotein assembly and secretion at a molecular level is incompletely understood. To begin to identify the determinants of apoprotein synthesis and distribution among lipoprotein classes, we have examined the effects of chylomicron remnants which deliver triglyceride and cholesterol, and beta very low density lipoprotein (beta VLDL), which deliver primarily cholesterol, on apolipoprotein synthesis and secretion by the human hepatoma Hep G2. Hep G2 cells were incubated with remnants or beta VLDL for 24 h, the medium was changed and the cells then incubated with [35S]methionine. The secreted lipoproteins were separated by gradient ultracentrifugation and the radiolabeled apoproteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and counted. Remnants caused a 14-fold, and beta VLDL a 7-fold, increase in VLDL apoprotein (apo) secretion; the apoB/apoE ratio in this class was unchanged. Preincubation with either of the lipoproteins also stimulated low density lipoprotein apoB secretion. Preincubation with beta VLDL, but not with remnants, significantly increased apoE and apoA-I secreted in high density lipoprotein (HDL). In addition, the apoE/apoA-I ratio precipitated from the HDL of beta VLDL-treated cells by anti-apoE was 2.2-fold higher than that precipitated by anti-apoA-I. There was no difference in the ratios precipitated from control HDL. This was due to the secretion of a lipoprotein, subsequently isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography, that contained predominantly apoE. When Hep G2 cells were preincubated with oleic acid alone, total apoprotein secretion was not altered. However, cholesterol-rich liposomes stimulated secretion of newly synthesized apoE, but not apoB, while apoA-I secretion was variably affected. Cholesterol-poor liposomes had no effect. Thus, lipid supply is a determinant of apoprotein synthesis and secretion, and cholesterol may be of particular importance in initiating apoprotein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1500244197,"Biochemical events associated with activation of smooth muscle contraction were studied in neurally stimulated bovine tracheal smooth muscle. A latency period of 500 ms preceded increases in isometric force and myosin light chain phosphorylation. However, stimulation resulted in the rapid hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids as demonstrated by increases in inositol phosphates by 500 ms. Inositol trisphosphate increased 2-fold with no significant change in inositol tetrakisphosphate. The apparent activation state of myosin light chain kinase was assessed indirectly through measurements of the fractional activation of a second calmodulin-dependent enzyme, cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. The fractional activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase increased after neural stimulation to a maximal extent by 500 ms and remained at this level for at least 4 s. The monophosphorylation of myosin light chain increased after 500 ms and reached a maximum value by 2 s. Diphosphorylation also occurred but to a much lesser extent. Fractional activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase and myosin light chain phosphorylation both decreased after 10 min continuous stimulation, although the force response remained at a maximal level. These observations demonstrate that inositol trisphosphate formation and activation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (and hence most likely myosin light chain kinase) by calmodulin precede myosin light chain phosphorylation and that these events are sufficiently rapid to mediate the contractile response of neurally stimulated tracheal smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1960500845,"Abstract To study the mechanism involved in the 3'-processing of mitochondrial tRNA precursors, we examined tRNA processing in a reconstituted system with a yeast mitochondrial extract. Two mitochondrial tRNA(Glu) precursors synthesized from SP6 RNA polymerase-directed transcription system were used as substrates. One contained a 214-nucleotide 5' terminus and 115-123-nucleotide 3' trailer. The other had the same sized 3' trailer, but contained a mature 5' terminus. An endonucleolytic activity was identified in a mitochondrial S30 fraction which cleaves the 3' terminus of the latter tRNA precursor precisely at the in vivo CCA addition site. No cleavage of the 5'-extended precursor was observed in vitro. This mitochondrial 3'-processing activity was partially purified using DEAE-CL-6B chromatography. It removes the 3' trailer sequence from the 5'-matured precursor leaving a 3'-hydroxyl group on the processed tRNA and a 5'-phosphate group on the trailer. The resulting tRNA product serves as a substrate for tRNA nucleotidyltransferase which catalyzes the addition of CCA residues to the tRNA to complete its 3' maturation. Thus, yeast mitochondrial 3'-tRNA processing events resemble those found in eucaryotic cytoplasmic/nuclear systems where a single endonucleolytic cleavage is responsible for the formation of the 3' end of the tRNAs. This is in contrast to the multistep 3'-processing events known to occur in procaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1592724456,"Vitamin D 25-hydroxylase was purified from female rat liver mitochondria based on the catalytic enzyme activity. The final preparation of cytochrome P-450 was homogeneous judging from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Mr = 52,500). The specific content of the purified enzyme was 12 nmol/mg of protein. The absorption spectrum of the purified enzyme showed a peak at 417 nm and that of the dithionite-reduced CO complex at 450 nm, indicating the enzyme belongs to the cytochrome P-450 family. Upon reconstitution with the electron-transferring system of the adrenal system (adrenodoxin and NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase), the enzyme showed a high activity in hydroxylating 1 alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol at position 25 with a turnover number of 3.8 min-1 and Km of 54 microM. The enzyme activity was completely lost when the electron-transferring system was repLaced by that of microsomes (NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase purified from rat liver microsomes), confirming that the P-450 enzyme was of the mitochondrial type, not the microsomal type. The omission of cytochrome P-450, adrenodoxin, or NADPH-adrenodoxin reductase resulted in complete loss of enzyme activity. The liver mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 hydroxylates vitamin D3 and 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 at position 25, but did not show any activity toward xenobiotics such as benzphetamine, 7-ethoxycoumarin, and benzo[a]pyrene. The enzyme activity was not inhibited by aminoglutethimide but slightly inhibited by metyrapone. The enzyme activity was markedly inhibited in an atmosphere of CO:O2:N2, 40:20:40."
https://openalex.org/W1597969470,"Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulated the rapid accumulation of inositol trisphosphate in WB cells, a continuous line of rat hepatic epithelial cells. Since we previously had shown that EGF stimulates EGF receptor synthesis in these cells, we tested whether hormones that stimulate PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis would increase EGF receptor protein synthesis and mRNA levels. Epinephrine, angiotensin II, and [Arg8]vasopressin activate phospholipase C in WB cells as evidenced by the accumulation of the inositol phosphates, inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol trisphosphate. A 3-4-h treatment with each hormone also increased the rate of EGF receptor protein synthesis by 3-6-fold as assessed by immunoprecipitation of EGF receptor from [35S]methionine-labeled cells. Northern blot analyses of WB cell EGF receptor mRNA levels revealed that agents linked to the phosphoinositide signaling system increased receptor mRNA content within 1-2 h. A maximal increase of 3-7-fold was observed after a 3-h exposure to EGF and hormones. The phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), which activates protein kinase C also stimulated EGF receptor synthesis. Pretreatment of WB cells for 18 h with high concentrations of TPA down-regulated protein kinase C and blocked TPA-directed EGF receptor mRNA synthesis. In contrast, the effect of EGF on EGF receptor mRNA levels was not significantly decreased by TPA pretreatment. Epinephrine-induced increases in EGF receptor mRNA were reduced from 4- to 2-fold. Similarly, 18 h TPA pretreatment abolished the effect of TPA on EGF receptor protein synthesis but did not affect EGF-dependent EGF receptor protein synthesis. The 18-h TPA pretreatment diminished by 30-50% the induction of receptor protein synthesis by epinephrine or angiotensin II. We conclude that in WB cells EGF receptor synthesis can be regulated by EGF and other hormones that stimulate PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis. In these cells, EGF receptor synthesis appears to be regulated by several mechanism: one pathway is dependent upon EGF receptor activation and can operate independently of protein kinase C activation; another pathway is correlated with PtdIns(4,5)P2 hydrolysis and is dependent, at least in part, upon protein kinase C activation."
https://openalex.org/W100697261,"Three actin-associated proteins, actin-binding protein, gelsolin, and profilin, influence gelation, solation, and polymerization, respectively, of actin in vitro. As assessed with specific cDNA probes and immunoaffinity reagents, a 7-50-fold increase in gelsolin, 3-5-fold increase in actin-binding protein, and less than 2-fold increases in actin and profilin protein and mRNA levels accompanied tetradecanoylphorbolacetate-induced differentiation of the myeloid cell lines U937 and HL60 into macrophage-like cells. Such induction in actin-binding protein or gelsolin did not occur in K562 cells, which respond minimally to tetradecanoylphorbolacetate, or following 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced monocyte-like differentiation of U937, which results in a less motile phenotype. These observations suggest that increases in gelsolin and actin-binding protein are essential to the expression of many regulated motile functions which takes place during differentiation of myeloid cells."
https://openalex.org/W1593219696,"Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) regulates the survival, growth, and differentiation of monocytes through binding to a single class of high affinity receptors. The present studies demonstrate that the interaction of CSF-1 with monocyte membranes is associated with a 2.4-fold increase in specific binding of the GTP analogue, GTP gamma S. Scatchard analysis of the GTP gamma S binding data indicated that CSF-1 stimulates GTP binding by increasing the affinity, rather than the number, of available sites. This stimulation of GTP binding by CSF-1 was also associated with an increase in GTPase activity. Furthermore, the CSF-1-induced stimulation of GTPase activity was sensitive to pertussis toxin. We also demonstrate that CSF-1 stimulates Na+ influx into monocytes by an amiloride-sensitive mechanism, presumably the Na+/H+ antiport. This CSF-1-stimulated influx of Na+ was further associated with an increase in Na+,K+-ATPase activity. Moreover, this stimulation of Na+ influx and Na+,K+-ATPase activity by CSF-1 was sensitive to pertussis toxin. Finally, we demonstrate that CSF-1-induced proliferation is also a pertussis toxin-sensitive event. The present findings thus suggest: 1) that the CSF-1 receptor is linked to a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein; and 2) that a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein is involved in the induction of Na+ influx by CSF-1."
https://openalex.org/W2147378267,"Saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids with appropriate chain length such as laurate and oleate activated an O2- -generating enzyme system in a cell-free preparation from porcine neutrophils. The activated preparation catalyzed a stoichiometric conversion of O2 to O2- by utilizing NADPH as the electron donor. The preparation contained both membrane and soluble fractions and, upon separation into subfractions, the O2- -generating activity resided exclusively in the membrane fraction. Polyunsaturated fatty acids including arachidonate also activated the system, but they concurrently stimulated NADPH-independent O2 consuming reactions which yield neither O2- nor H2O2. The amount of such a non-O2- -producing O2 consumption often reached twice as much as that of O2- production. For the activation of the O2- -generating system in the membrane, the presence of the soluble fraction was essential. However, the soluble fraction was no longer effective when once used for the activation, suggesting that the effective component(s) in the fraction was consumed or translocated to the membrane during the activation. When the activated membrane was incubated with delipidated albumin, the activity was lost with concomitant decreases in the amount of membrane-associated fatty acids. The lost activity was restored by the replenishment of the fatty acid in the presence of a fresh soluble fraction. We also found that Ca2+ augmented a non-O2- -producing O2 consumption in the cell-free preparation by unsaturated fatty acids and interfered with the activation of the O2- -generating system, especially that by saturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1493141363,"A transfer RNA complete devoid of modified nucleosides was synthesized by in vitro transcription, and some of its properties in aminoacylation and protein synthesis in vitro were studied. For this purpose, a plasmid was constructed which contained a glycine tRNA gene from Mycoplasma mycoides under the promoter of the T7 RNA polymerase, as well as a BstNI restriction site at the 3â²-end of the tRNA gene. Cleavage of plasmid DNA with BstNI followed by T7 RNA polymerase transcription in vitro yielded an RNA which was processed with M1 RNA, the catalytic subunit of ribonuclease P, to give a tRNA of mature length. The tRNA synthesized in this manner can be esterified with glycine in vitro, and the rate of aminoacylation is the same as when using the corresponding fully modified glycine tRNA from M. mycoides. Furthermore, in protein synthesis in vitro, the tRNA lacking modified nucleosides was essentially as efficient as the corresponding normal glycine tRNA. However, the Escherichia coli extract used in our protein-synthesizing system introduced one modification, pseudouridine, into the in vitro-synthesized tRNA, and it cannot be excluded that this modification has an essential role in protein synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2169062083,"DnaA protein interacts with cAMP with a KD of 1 microM. This interaction stimulates DnaA protein binding to the chromosome replication origin (oriC) and the mioC promoter region, protects DnaA protein from thermal inactivation, releases ADP but not ATP bound to DnaA protein, and restores normal DNA replication activity and ATPase activity in inactive ADP-DnaA protein preparations. A model is proposed in which cellular cAMP levels govern the replication activity of DnaA protein by promoting the recycling of the inactive ADP-DnaA protein form into the active ATP form."
https://openalex.org/W1601974758,"Lithium perturbs intracellular signal transduction pathways used by neurotransmitters, suggesting that changes in receptor signalling may underlie its actions in the treatment of manic depressive illness. Little attention, however, has been directed toward possible additional actions at the level of specific gene expression, particularly of genes encoding neurotransmitters or neuromodulators. In PC12 pheochromocytoma cells, lithium dramatically potentiates increases in intracellular levels of the neuropeptide neurotensin and the mRNA encoding it, caused by combinations of nerve growth factor, dexamethasone, and the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin. This result demonstrates that lithium can profoundly influence the expression of a specific neuropeptide gene in a previously unanticipated manner and suggests that changes in gene expression might be involved in its therapeutic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1485816610,"The intravenous administration of glucagon to anesthetized rats resulted within 5 min in a 20% drop in the hepatic phosphorylase phosphatase activity, as measured in a post-mitochondrial supernatant at low dilution, but it did not affect the activity of glycogensynthase phosphatase. On the other hand, the injection of insulin plus glucose caused increases by about 35% in both phosphatase activities. Upon subcellular fractionation these effects were recovered in the cytosol, but not in the glycogen/microsomal fraction. However, activity changes in the latter fraction were observed after recombination with the liver cytosol from a hormone-treated animal. Preincubation of the liver cytosol with modulator protein (a specific inhibitor of type-1 protein phosphatases) cancelled the activity changes induced by insulin plus glucose. No hormonal effects on hepatic protein phosphatase activities were observed when the fractions were either diluted an additional 10-fold or pretreated with trypsin. An acute hormonal regulation of protein phosphatases could also be demonstrated in the perfused liver. When added to the perfusion medium, glucose as well as insulin increased the cytosolic protein phosphatase activities by about 25%. Their effect was additive, irrespective of the order of addition. On the other hand, the addition of glucagon and/or vasopressin resulted in a 20% drop in the phosphorylase phosphatase activity. The presence of glucagon did not interfere with the effectiveness of insulin, and vice versa. The changes in the phosphorylase phosphatase activities induced by glucagon, insulin, and glucose represented changes in the Vmax only. We propose that the acute control of the hepatic glycogen synthase phosphatase and phosphorylase phosphatase activities is mediated by transferable, cytosolic effector(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1538296334,"The BtuB protein of Escherichia coli is a multifunctional outer membrane receptor required for the binding and uptake of vitamin B12, bacteriophage BF23, and the E colicins. The btuB gene was mutagenized by the insertion of 6-base pair linkers into each of ten HpaII sites distributed throughout the coding region. Receptor function was measured with the mutated genes present in single or multiple copies. All of the mutant proteins were found in the outer membrane in similar amounts, although two of them were susceptible to cleavage by endogenous proteolytic activity. The vitamin B12 transport activity mediated by five of the mutants was essentially identical to that of the wild type. Four mutations (insertions after amino acids 50, 252, and 412, and a duplication of residues 434-472) reduced uptake activity to less than 2% of parental, whereas insertions at residues 343 and 434 had less severe effect. The insertions at residues 50 and 252 appeared to slow the rate of cobalamin binding to the receptor; the defect in the former mutant was partially corrected by elevated calcium levels. The insertion at residue 412 did not affect the rate of substrate binding but slowed its release from the receptor. Most of the receptors conferred susceptibility to phage BF23 and the E colicins, although several mutants were altered in the degree of their sensitivity to the lethal agents. None of the mutations affected the entry of only one type of ligand. Thus, several receptor domains have been implicated in substrate binding and energy coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1545097323,"Abstract The role of N-linked oligosaccharide side chains in the biogenesis and function of Na+-coupled transporters in renal luminal brush-border membrane (BBM) is not known. We examined the question of how in vivo inhibition by alkaloid swainsonine of alpha-mannosidase, a key enzyme in processing of glycoproteins in the Golgi apparatus, affects Na+/H+ antiport and Na+/Pi symport as well as activities of other transporters and enzymes in rat renal BBM. Administration of swainsonine to thyroparathyroidectomized rats, control or treated with 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine, markedly decreased the rate of Na+/H+ antiport, but had no effect on the rate of Na+/Pi symport across renal BBM vesicles (BBMV). Moreover, administration of swainsonine did not change activities of Na+ gradient, ([extravesicular Na+] greater than [intravesicular Na+])-dependent transport of D-glucose, L-proline, or the amiloride-insensitive 22Na+ uptake by BBMV; the activities of the BBM enzymes alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, or leucine aminopeptidase in BBMV were also not changed. The in vitro enzymatic deglycosylation of BBM by incubating freshly isolated BBMV with bacterial endoglycosidase F also resulted in a decreased rate of Na+/H+ antiport, but not Na+-coupled symports of Pi, L-proline, and D-glucose, or the activities of the BBM enzymes were not significantly affected. Similar incubation with endoglycosidase H was without effect on any of these parameters. Both the modification of BBMV glycoproteins by administration fo swainsonine in vivo as well as the in vitro incubation of BBMV with endoglycosidase F resulted in a decrease of the apparent Vmax of Na+/H+ antiport, but did not change the apparent Km of this antiporter for extravesicular Na+ and did not increase H+ conductance of BBM. Taken together, our findings suggest that intact N-linked oligosaccharide chains of the biantennary complex type in renal BBM glycoproteins are required, directly or indirectly, for the transport function of the Na+/H+ antiporter inserted into BBM of renal proximal tubules."
https://openalex.org/W1481718128,"We isolated mutants of Escherichia coli which showed Li+-resistant growth on melibiose. The melibiose carrier of the mutants lost the ability to couple to H+, whereas it retained the ability to couple to Na+. The mutated gene, melB, of the mutants was cloned, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The nucleotide replacements caused the following substitutions of amino acid residues in the melibiose carrier: Pro-142 with Ser, Leu-232 with Phe, or Ala-236 with Thr or Val. These amino acid residues are located in slightly hydrophobic regions of the melibiose carrier. The results provide strong support for the idea that such regions or their vicinities which contain those amino acid residues play an important role in H+ (or Li+) recognition or H+ (or Li+) transport by the melibiose carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1516626602,"Transcription was carried out in vitro by RNA polymerase on supercoiled minichromosome DNA containing the replication origin of the Escherichia coli chromosome (oriC) and the products were analyzed. Leftward transcription starting from the 16-kDa gene promoter located adjacent to the right of oriC was inhibited by the DnaA protein, a protein essential for initiation of replication. This inhibition is due to binding of DnaA protein to the 9-base pair sequence (dnaA box) located just upstream of the 16-kDa gene promoter. The inhibition was observed at levels of DnaA protein and RNA polymerase comparable to those required for replication of oriC plasmids in vitro and was abolished at high levels of RNA polymerase. These results suggest that a balance of DnaA protein and RNA polymerase is important in regulating transcription and that this regulation operates under conditions that allow initiation of replication. The transcription traversed oriC with very few transcripts terminating before or within it. DnaA protein did not affect the chain length of these transcripts. Furthermore, we identified leftward transcripts which start close to position 177 in the oriC sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1580602551,"The oxidation of yeast cytochrome c peroxidase by hydrogen peroxide produces a unique enzyme intermediate, cytochrome c peroxidase Compound I, in which the ferric heme iron has been oxidized to an oxyferryl state, Fe(IV), and an amino acid residue has been oxidized to a radical state. The reduction of cytochrome c peroxidase Compound I by horse heart ferrocytochrome c is biphasic in the presence of excess ferrocytochrome c as cytochrome c peroxidase Compound I is reduced to the native enzyme via a second enzyme intermediate, cytochrome c peroxidase Compound II. In the first phase of the reaction, the oxyferryl heme iron in Compound I is reduced to the ferric state producing Compound II which retains the amino acid free radical. The pseudo-first order rate constant for reduction of Compound I to Compound II increases with increasing cytochrome c concentration in a hyperbolic fashion. The limiting value at infinite cytochrome c concentration, which is attributed to the intracomplex electron transfer rate from ferrocytochrome c to the heme site in Compound I, is 450 +/- 20 s-1 at pH 7.5 and 25 degrees C. Ferricytochrome c inhibits the reaction in a competitive manner. The reduction of the free radical in Compound II is complex. At low cytochrome c peroxidase concentrations, the reduction rate is 5 +/- 3 s-1, independent of the ferrocytochrome c concentration. At higher peroxidase concentrations, a term proportional to the square of the Compound II concentration is involved in the reduction of the free radical. Reduction of Compound II is not inhibited by ferricytochrome c. The rates and equilibrium constant for the interconversion of the free radical and oxyferryl forms of Compound II have also been determined."
https://openalex.org/W1593344900,"Predicted single-stranded structure at the 3' splice site is a conserved feature among intervening sequences (IVSs) in eukaryotic nuclear tRNA precursors. The role of 3' splice site structure in splicing was examined through hexanucleotide insertions at a central intron position in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA gene. These insertions were designed to alter the structure at the splice site without changing its sequence. Endonuclease cleavage of pre-tRNA substrates was then measured in vitro, and suppressor activity was examined in vivo. A precursor with fully double-stranded structure at the 3' splice site was not cleaved by endonuclease. The introduction of one unpaired nucleotide at the 3' splice site was sufficient to restore cleavage, although at a reduced rate. We have also observed that guanosine at the antepenultimate position provides a second consensus feature among IVSs in tRNA precursors. Point mutations at this position were found to affect splicing although there was no specific requirement for guanosine. These and previous results suggest that elements of secondary and/or tertiary structure at the 3' end of IVSs are primary determinants in pre-tRNA splice site utilization whereas specific sequence requirements are limited."
https://openalex.org/W1552773378,"Preincubation with an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist sensitized subsequent forskolin- and vasoactive intestinal peptide-stimulated cyclic AMP production in HT29 cells, a human colonic adenocarcinoma cell line. Preincubation with somatostatin, another agonist negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, sensitized forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production to a lesser extent. alpha 2-Adrenergic agonist preincubation also resulted in desensitization as indicated by a shift to the right in the dose-response curve of a subsequent challenge by an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist. In an effort to elucidate the mechanism for sensitization, we examined protein kinase C and the Na+/H+ antiporter. Whereas these components had marked effects on forskolin stimulation, there was no effect on sensitization. Changes in the concentration of extra-cellular Ca2+ or Mg2+ had no effect on either forskolin stimulation or sensitization. Pertussis toxin pretreatment caused a time-dependent decrease in sensitization, an attenuation of inhibition of cyclic AMP production, and a decrease in subsequent [32P]ADP-ribosylation by pertussis toxin. The time course for these three events was similar, implicating the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein in the mechanism for alpha 2-adrenergic receptor-mediated sensitization of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production. In addition, pertussis toxin dramatically decreased forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production, although with a different time course. These results suggest that the mechanism of sensitization is via an as yet undefined sequence of biochemical events that includes the inhibitory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein, but does not include inhibition of adenylate cyclase nor activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter."
https://openalex.org/W1484212793,"Physical interactions between pyridoxal kinase and aspartate aminotransferase were detected by means of emission anisotropy and affinity chromatography techniques. Binding of aspartate aminotransferase (apoenzymes) to pyridoxal kinase tagged with a fluorescent probe was detected by emission anisotropy measurements at pH 6.8 (150 mM KCl). Upon saturation of the kinase with the aminotransferase, the emission anisotropy increases 22%. The protein complex is characterized by a dissociation constant of 3 microM. Time-dependent emission anisotropy measurements conducted with the mixture 5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid-kinase aspartate aminotransferase (apoenzyme), revealed the presence of two rotational correlation times of phi 1 = 36 and phi 2 = 62 ns. The longer correlation time is attributed to the stable protein complex. By immobilizing one enzyme (pyridoxal kinase) through interactions with pyridoxal-Sepharose, it was possible to demonstrate that aspartate aminotransferase releases pyridoxal kinase. A test of compartmentation of pyridoxal-5-phosphate within the protein complex using alkaline phosphatase as trapping agent, indicates that the cofactor generated by the catalytic action of the kinase is channeled to the apotransaminase. The main function of the stable complex formed by the kinase and the aminotransferase is to hinder the release of free pyridoxal-5-phosphate into the bulk solvent."
https://openalex.org/W1534868366,"Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a potent secretagogue for adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) release from normal corticotropes and from ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma cells. To explore the mechanism underlying this action, we investigated the effects of AVP on Ca2+-dependent action potentials and Ca2+ currents in cultured human ACTH-containing pituitary tumor cells (hACTH adenoma cells). Pituitary adenoma fragments removed at surgery from two patients with Cushing's disease were dispersed, and the isolated cells were grown in monolayer culture. Most of the cells showed ACTH immunoreactivity that persisted even after as much as 2 months in culture. Current clamp and voltage clamp recordings were carried out using the patch-clamp technique in the whole cell configuration. AVP produced an increase in the amplitude and duration of action potentials in these cells, and substantially enhanced the transient after-hyperpolarization after each spike. Under voltage the transient after-hyperpolarization after each spike. Under voltage clamp, hACTH adenoma cells showed two Ca2+ current components: a low-threshold, rapidly inactivating (T-type) current; and a higher threshold, slowly inactivating (L-type) current. AVP markedly increased the amplitude of the L-type current without affecting the T-type current. These data suggest that AVP may enhance Ca2+ entry associated with action potentials by potentiating the activity of L-type Ca2+ channels. The resulting rise in cytosolic free Ca2+ may be a key link in the process by which AVP stimulates ACTH release in the pituitary."

(1984) Chromosoma (Berl.) 89, 228-237), was detected in the 0.35 M NaCl extract of the female chicken liver nuclei. This protein, designated as W-protein, was substantially purified by phosphocellulose, hydroxyapatite, and DEAE-Toyopearl column chromatography. Molecular weight of W-protein was estimated to be about 72,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, but it seems to form multimeric structure having apparent molecular weight of about 2.3 X 10(6) under nondenaturing conditions. W-Protein binds strongly to both 0.7- and 1.1-kb repeating units of the XhoI family, both of which show curved DNA characteristics, and weakly to the AATAT-satellite sequence of Drosophila melanogaster. Stable binding of W-protein requires greater than or equal to 300 base pairs of the 0.7-kilobases sequence, or more than 14 tandem repeats of the 21-base pair internal repeating unit of the 0.7-kilobase sequence. DNA footprint analysis and effects of some DNA-binding compounds suggest that the DNA double helix wraps around W-protein or its multimeric form contacting through A-T-rich minor grooves. A possible role of W-protein in the formation of W heterochromatic body is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561159629,"The reaction of the iron-molybdenum cofactor with thiolate and the redox behavior of the iron-molybdenum cofactor-thiolate complex have been studied by 19F NMR using p-CF3C6H4S- as the reporter ligand. These experiments give results different from those produced by other methods which have been performed near 4 K rather than at ambient temperature. Specifically, these data show that the iron-molybdenum cofactor-thiolate complex is not the product of an irreversible reaction. Rather, the complex is in dynamic equilibrium with the free iron-molybdenum cofactor and free thiolate. Models of the reactions of nitrogenase may need to take this temperature-dependent difference into account because the lability of the iron-molybdenum thiolate bond means its making and breaking could be involved in substrate binding or reduction. The 19F NMR results reported here also show that the S = 3/2 state of the iron-molybdenum cofactor-thiolate complex can be easily and reversibly oxidized by one electron. However, electron exchange between the oxidized and reduced states of the complex is quite slow at approximately 1 mM. Based on low temperature spectroscopic studies, the oxidized iron-molybdenum cofactor-thiolate complex was expected to be diamagnetic. Isotropically shifted NMR spectra of the oxidized cofactor samples at 240-320 K, however, indicate at least partial population of a paramagnetic state, possibly with S = 1."

In normal developing cells PMA was found to increase the rate of iron uptake by 15-30%. There was, however, no effect on transferrin receptor distribution, suggesting that the increase in iron uptake was due to stimulation of the rate of receptor cycling. In contrast, in transformed myogenic cells, PMA had no effect even at concentrations 10 times those effective in normal myogenic cells. The specificity of PMA was demonstrated by comparison with 4 alpha-phorbol which had no effect compared with the control cells which were incubated with dimethyl sulfoxide, the solvent used to dissolve the phorbols. These results indicate a functional difference in the transferrin receptor between normal and transformed myogenic cells. The data for normal myogenic cells are similar to those previously reported for normal erythroid cells, but differ from those for some transformed cell lines in which phorbol esters were shown to cause internalization of transferrin receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1540688871,"Abstract The stereochemical course of hydrolysis catalyzed by the cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase from bovine retinal rod outer segments was determined. The Sp diastereomer of guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate was hydrolyzed by cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase in H2(18)O to give [16O,18O]guanosine 5'-monophosphorothioate. This isotopomer was reacted with diphenyl phosphorochloridate to form the two diastereomers of P1-(5'-guanosyl) P2-(diphenyl) 1-thiodiphosphate. The 31P NMR spectrum of this mixture of diastereomers was identical to that obtained from [16O,18O]guanosine 5'-monophosphorothioate resulting from the hydrolysis of the Rp diastereomer of guanosine 5'-p-nitrophenyl phosphorothioate by snake venom phosphodiesterase. This finding indicates that the 18O is bridging in the Rp diastereomer of the P1-(5'-guanosyl) P2-(diphenyl) 1-thiodiphosphate and nonbridging in the Sp diastereomer. As the snake venom phosphodiesterase reaction is known to proceed with retention of configuration, it follows that hydrolysis by retinal rod cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase proceeds with inversion of configuration at the phosphorus atom."
