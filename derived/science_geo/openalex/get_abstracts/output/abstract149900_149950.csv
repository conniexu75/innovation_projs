The mRNA level of 186 genes increased at least 3-fold after a shift to NaCl or sorbitol, whereas that of more than 100 genes was at least 1.5-fold diminished. Many induced genes encode proteins that presumably contribute to protection against different types of damage or encode enzymes in glycerol, trehalose, and glycogen metabolism. Several genes, which encode poorly expressed isoforms of enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism, were induced. The high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway is required for full induction of many but not all genes. The recently characterized Hot1p transcription factor is required for normal expression of a subset of the HOG pathway-dependent responses. Stimulated expression of the genes that required the general stress-response transcription factors Msn2p and Msn4p was also reduced in a hog1 mutant, suggesting that Msn2p/Msn4p might be regulated by the HOG pathway. The expression of genes that are known to be controlled by the mating pheromone response pathway was stimulated by osmotic shock specifically in a hog1 mutant. Inappropriate activation of the mating response may contribute to the growth defect of a hog1 mutant in high osmolarity medium.

Physiol. 1997; 59: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To properly control gene expression, the cell has to sense osmotic changes and transmit the signal to the nucleus. It appears that many if not all eukaryotic cells employ mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase pathways for this purpose (3.Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Posas F. Takekawa M. Saito H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 7.Nadkarni V. Gabbay K.H.

The best characterized osmosensing MAP kinase pathway is the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (3.Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K.

Two different transmembrane proteins, Sho1p and Sln1p, appear to serve as independent osmosensors (8.Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H.

Sho1p transmits its signal via Ste50p and Ste20p to the MAPKKK Ste11p and further to the MAPKK Pbs2p (9.Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 10.Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 11.O'Rourke S.M. Herskowitz I.

Sln1p together with Ypd1p and Ssk1p forms a phosphorelay system that transmits the signal to a redundant pair of MAPKKK, Ssk2p and Ssk22p, and further to the MAPKK Pbs2p (6.Posas F. Takekawa M.

The two branches of the pathway converge at the level of Pbs2p, which also seems to play a role as a scaffold protein (6.Posas F. Takekawa M. Saito H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9.Maeda T. Takekawa M. Saito H. Science. 1995; 269: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar,10.Posas F. Saito H. Science. 1997; 276: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Pbs2p phosphorylates the MAPK, Hog1p, leading to translocation of Hog1p to the nucleus (8.Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 15.Brewster J.L. de Valoir T. Dwyer N.D. Winter E. Gustin M.C.

Ammerer G. Ruis H. Gene Expr. 1999; 7: 247-254PubMed Google Scholar). Protein interaction and phosphotransfer in the HOG pathway and the nuclear translocation process of Hog1p have been studied in great detail (3.Gustin M.C. Albertyn J. Alexander M. Davenport K. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1264-1300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Posas F. Takekawa M. Saito H. Curr. Opin.

The stimulation by osmotic shock of Hog1p phosphorylation is rapid and transient (8.Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). 2M. Rep, M. J. TamaÃÅs, J. M. Thevelein, and S. Hohmann, unpublished data. Within about 1 min after osmotic upshift (depending on severity of the shock) tyrosine phosphorylation of Hog1p and nuclear translocation are apparent (8.Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar).2 After a mild osmotic shock (0.5m NaCl), Hog1p remains phoshorylated and located in the nucleus for about 10 min (8.Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 16.Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A.

Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). At this time point, an increase in the mRNA level of osmo-induced genes becomes apparent (19.Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 20.Rep M. Albertyn J. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Hohmann S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The induction by osmotic shock of many genes studied so far is characterized by a sharp peak, which is observed for instance 45 min after an osmotic shock of 0.7 m NaCl (19.Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 20.Rep M. Albertyn J. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Hohmann S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The transient nuclear localization of Hog1p and detailed analysis of the time courses of osmotic induction of certain genes in a hog1mutant suggest that Hog1p may be specifically involved in the early induction phase of gene expression (16.Ferrigno P. Posas F. Koepp D. Saito H. Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5606-5614Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17.Reiser V. Ruis H. Ammerer G. Mol. Biol.

Microbiology. 1999; 145: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, transcription factors that are required for the stimulation of gene expression after an osmotic shock have been described. Msn2p/Msn4p are a pair of apparently redundant transcription factors that bind to stress response elements (STREs) (21.Marchler G. SchuÃàller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 22.Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. SchuÃàller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 23.Schmitt A.P. McEntee K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5777-5782Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). These elements are characterized by the core sequence CCCCT in either orientation and are usually found in two or more copies in front of Msn2p/Msn4p target genes (24.Treger J.M. Magee T.R. McEntee K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 25.Moskvina E. Schuller C. Maurer C.T.C. Mager W.H. Ruis H. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1041-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Msn2p/Msn4p appear to control a general stress response because target genes are induced by heat and osmotic shock, oxidative stress, and nutrient starvation (21.Marchler G. SchuÃàller C. Adam G. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1997-2003Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 22.Martinez-Pastor M.T. Marchler G. SchuÃàller C. Marchler-Bauer A. Ruis H. Estruch F. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2227-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 26.Ruis H. SchuÃàller C. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 959-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 27.Mager W.H. de Kruijff A.J.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 506-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Siderius M. Mager W.H. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 213-230Google Scholar). Upon stress, Msn2p/Msn4p are phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus, events that are influenced by protein kinase A (29.GoÃàrner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. SchuÃàller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 30.Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The induction by osmotic shock of an artificial promoter, whose only activating sequence was a repeat of STREs, has been shown to depend on the HOG pathway (31.SchuÃàller G. Brewster J.L. Alexander M.R. Gustin M.C. Ruis H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4382-4389Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), suggesting that in addition to protein kinase A Hog1p may also control Msn2p/Msn4p activity. However, this possibility has not been directly addressed experimentally. We have recently identified Hot1p, another putative transcriptional regulator involved in osmo-induced gene expression. Hot1p interacts in the two-hybrid system with the Hog1p kinase, and further genetic evidence suggests that Hot1p is part of the HOG pathway (19.Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). The induction after osmotic shock of genes encoding enzymes in glycerol production, GPD1 and GPP2, is dramatically diminished in a hot1 mutant (19.Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Binding of Hot1p to DNA has not yet been demonstrated. Stimulated expression of some HOG pathway-dependent genes after osmotic shock appears to be the result of derepression (32.MaÃÅrquez J.A. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Sko1p has recently been described as a repressor of such genes, and genetic evidence places Sko1p downstream of Hog1p (33.Proft M. Serrano R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). 3M. Rep, F. Remize, M. J. TamaÃÅs, M. Proft, R. Serrano, J. M. Thevelein, and S. Hohmann, manuscript in preparation. In this work we have used genome-wide transcriptional analysis to identify the genes whose induction after an osmotic shock was dependent on the HOG pathway, Hot1p and Msn2p/Msn4p, respectively. The wild type strain used in this study was W303‚Äì1A (MATa leu2‚Äì3, 112 ura3‚Äì1 trp1‚Äì1 his3‚Äì11, 15 ade2‚Äì1 can1‚Äì100 GAL SUC2 mal0) (35.Thomas B.J. Rothstein R.J. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). The mutants YSH444 (MATahog1Œî::TRP1) (36.Albertyn J. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4135-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), YM24 (MATamsn2‚Äì3::HIS3 msn4‚Äì1::TRP1) (37.Estruch F. Carlson M. Mol. Cell.

Cells were grown as batch cultures in YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) to an A 600 of 1.0 (¬± 0.2). At this point cells were collected for determination of expression profiles under basal conditions. Osmotic stress was applied by addition of 5 m NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 or 0.7 m NaCl or, alternatively, by collection and subsequent resuspension of cells in YPD containing 0.95 m sorbitol. Samples were taken at time points at which mRNA levels of representative osmoresponsive genes are maximal as previously revealed by Northern blotting. For the wild type these time points were 45 min for 0.7 m NaCl and 30 min for 0.5 m NaCl or 0.95 m sorbitol; for the hot1 mutant 45 min for 0.7 m NaCl; for the msn2 msn4 mutant 30 min for 0.5 m NaCl; for the hog1 mutant 45 min for 0.5m NaCl (19.Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5474-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 20.Rep M. Albertyn J. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Hohmann S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated as described previously (38.de Winde J.H. Crauwels M. Hohmann S. Thevelein J.M. Winderickx J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). [33P]CTP-labeled cDNA was synthesized in the following way. 5 Œºg of total RNA and 2 Œºg of oligo(dT) (10‚Äì20-mer mixture, Research Genetics) were mixed in 8 Œºl of water, heated for 10 min at 70 ¬∞C, and then chilled on ice. The following components were added: first strand buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), dithiothreitol (3.3 mm), dATP, dGTP, and dTTP (1 mm each), Superscript II reverse transcriptase (300 units; Life Technologies, Inc.), and [33P]CTP (100 ŒºCi, 3000 Ci/mmol). The mixture (30-Œºl volume) was incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 90 min. The probe was then purified by passage through a Sephadex G-50 column. Approximately 60‚Äì70% of the label was incorporated in high molecular weight products. Genefilters¬Æ (Research Genetics) were prehybridized for 3‚Äì6 h with 5 ml of MicroHyb solution (Research Genetics) at 42 ¬∞C in a roller oven (Hybaid). The purified cDNA probe was denatured for 5 min at 95 ¬∞C and added to the prehybridization mixture. After overnight hybridization at 42 ¬∞C filters were rinsed with 2 √ó SSC, 0.1% SDS and incubated in the same buffer at 50 ¬∞C for 45 min. Filters were then rinsed with 0.5 √ó SSC, 0.1% SDS, transferred to a plastic box, and washed with 0.5 √ó SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min. A PhosphorImager (Fuji, BAS-1000) was used to obtain a digital image of the filters. Filters were kept moist to facilitate stripping between hybridizations, and stripping was done with 0.5% SDS, which was first heated to 100 ¬∞C. Filters were rinsed with this solution and submerged in it for 15 min on a shaker while the solution was allowed to cool. More than 95% of the signal was consistently removed by this procedure. Images produced by MacBas¬Æ (Fuji) were converted to TIFF and imported into the Pathways¬Æ software (Research Genetics). Pathways¬Æ was used for a preliminary quantification of spot intensities to compare gene filter images pairwise. In this way the genes that were differentially expressed were identified. Spot intensities were then quantified using the original image files with the MacBas¬Æ program. We noted that information was lost during conversion to TIFF and that therefore the differences between conditions/strains calculated by Pathways¬Æ greatly underestimated the actual differences. To determine the extent of induction or repression of gene expression, all spot intensities were normalized against IPP1 (which encodes inorganic pyrophosphatase), whose expression is not affected by osmotic stress (20.Rep M. Albertyn J. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Hohmann S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mRNA level of IPP1 is very similar to that of ACT1 (encoding actin), which is commonly used as a control but fluctuates after osmotic shock (20.Rep M. Albertyn J. Thevelein J.M. Prior B.A. Hohmann S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A detection threshold was set at 0.02-fold the IPP1 mRNA level to avoid distortion of calculated induction or repression ratios by very small and unreliable values. The relative mRNA levels calculated in this way indicate whether a gene is strongly or poorly expressed. It should be noted, however, that hybridization intensity also depends on the length of the ORF and on that of the cDNA used for hybridization. This means that comparison of relative mRNA levels between different genes should be done with caution. To determine the -fold induction or repression, the relative mRNA level after osmotic shock was divided by that before the shock. If basal expression was below the threshold, induction ratios were reported as ‚Äú>(induced value/0.02).‚Äù We have listed all genes whose mRNA level after addition of salt and/or sorbitol was at least 3-fold higher or 1.5-fold lower than before the osmotic shock because those values were found to be reproducible and allowed inclusion of almost all genes known to be osmoregulated. To give a quantitative impression of the effect on osmotic induction conferred by a certain mutation an ‚Äúeffect factor‚Äù was calculated. For this, the relative mRNA level after osmotic shock in the mutant strain was divided by that of the wild type (i.e. an effect factor of 0.25 is equivalent to 25%). Hence, the lower the effect factor the less the gene was expressed in the mutant relative to the wild type. It should be noted, however, that in many instances the mutations also affect the basal expression level. Hence, even if the effect factor was close to 0.00 it is possible that the gene was still induced in the mutant, although its expression level was more than 100-fold diminished. Usually, however, diminished expression in a mutant was also accompanied by diminished induction. We found that this representation of data gave a better reflection of the effects conferred by a mutation than comparison of induction factors. We have evaluated the behavior of a number of highly similar isogenes to estimate the threshold sequence identity above which cross-hybridization makes data unreliable.GPD1-GPD2 (75% identity),SSA1-SSA3 (76%), SSA3-SSA4 (77%),CYC1-CYC7 (78%), TSA1-YDR453C (79%),GND1-GND2 (79%), GPP1-GPP2(82%), HXT1-HXT3 (82%), and GSP1-GSP2 (83%) behaved independently, whereas UBI4-RPS31-RPL40A-RPL40B(100%), SSA1-SSA2 (95%),ENO1-ENO2 (94%), andTDH1-TDH2 (90%) gave identical hybridization patterns. Therefore, we concluded that genes with a DNA sequence identity above 90% should not be considered in the analysis, genes below 83% identity can reliably be distinguished, and genes between 83 and 90% identity may show variable specificity. ALD2(YMR170C, also previously called ALD5) andALD3 (YMR169C, also previously calledALD4) are 92% identical (39.Navarro-Avino J.P. Prasad R. Miralles V.J. Benito R.M. Serrano R. Yeast. 1999; 15: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Both gave similar results in gene filter experiments and are also known to be both stress- and osmo-induced (40.Miralles V.J. Serrano R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41.Boy-Marcotte E. Perrot M. Bussereau F. Boucherie H. Jacquet M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1044-1052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hence the data concerning these two genes may be reliable. The three genes of the ENA/PMR2 gene cluster,ENA1, ENA2, and ENA5, are more than 98% identical (42.Wieland J. Nitsche A.M. Strayle J. Steiner H. Rudolph H.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3870-3882Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and are all induced by osmotic stress. Hence the data given for ENA1 are in fact cumulative for these three genes. The great majority of changes in expression found with the first set of filters was confirmed by repeating experiments with a second set of filters. Some cases where there were small changes in expression with only one set of filters were discarded. Comparison of expression profiles of independent cultures of wild type yeast grown under the same conditions (midlogarithmic growth phase in YPD) revealed no significant differences. Data obtained from the Genefilter¬Æ analysis agreed very well with previous Northern blot data (19.Rep M. Reiser V. Gartner U. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Ammerer G. Ruis H. Mol. Cell.

Hence, Genefilters¬Æ are an appropriate and simple way to perform genome-wide transcriptional analysis, especially where glass or chip-based microarrays are not yet available. A recent report using the same technology came to a similar conclusion (43.Cox K.H. Pinchak A.B. Cooper T.G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 703-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, there are certain limitations. The gene set is incomplete, i.e. genesYPR131C through YPR204W (the ‚Äúlast‚Äù 74 genes on chromosome 16) were omitted and a number of smaller ORFs, which are now known to be expressed, are not represented. Overall, approximately 100 of the 6,200 genes are missing. None of these genes is known to be osmo-induced. A further limitation concerns the cross-hybridization of highly homologous genes (see ‚ÄúMaterials and Methods‚Äù), which can largely be avoided by using oligonucleotide-based microarrays. Finally, the present analysis software did not allow reliable quantification in our hands, which was done manually on the original PhosphorImager data with the corresponding software (see ‚ÄúMaterials and Methods‚Äù). Our previous Northern blot analysis of osmo-induced genes such as GPD1, GPP2, CTT1, andHSP12 had shown that the mRNA level is highest 45 min after an osmotic shock with 0.7 m NaCl and 30 min after addition of sorbitol to a final concentration of 0.95 m(19.Rep M.

Prior B.A. Hohmann S. Microbiology. 1999; 145: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). mRNA was extracted from wild type cells at these time points after a shift to high osmolarity medium and used for gene filter experiments. The mRNA level of a total of 186 genes was at least 3-fold higher after addition of NaCl and/or sorbitol and that of more than 100 genes was at least 1.5-fold lower (TablesI and II). The 186 induced genes included all those previously reported to be induced after osmotic shock with the exceptions of HAL1(32.MaÃÅrquez J.A. Pascual-Ahuir A. Proft M. Serrano R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2543-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), GAC1 (44.Parrou J.L. Teste M.A. Francois J.

In addition, induction of the genesUBI4 (46.Simon J.R. Treger J.M. McEntee K. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), ENO1, and TDH1 (47.Norbeck J. Blomberg A.

Surprisingly, the expression of only 10 genes was stimulated more than 2-fold more strongly by salt than by sorbitol. Because the sodium-specific response of gene expression is stimulated by signaling pathways different from those controlling osmotic responses (48.Serrano R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1996; 165: 1-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Serrano R. MaÃÅrquez J.A. Rƒ±ÃÅos G. Hohmann S. Mager W.H. Yeast Stress Responses. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1997: 147-169Google Scholar), it is possible that salt-specific genes follow a different stimulation time course. Unexpectedly, there were 26 genes whose expression was at least 2-fold more strongly stimulated by sorbitol than by salt, and 4 genes, CAR1, YDL222C, ALD6, andCDC55, were induced more than 4-fold more strongly by sorbitol. This observation indicates that either sorbitol induces specific responses or that NaCl has a negative effect on the expression of some osmo-induced genes. We grouped the induced as well as the repressed genes into functional categories to identify biochemical processes possibly controlled by osmotic shock (Tables I and II) (see ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù). Ribosomal protein genes were not listed individually (Table II). Some induced genes were placed in more than one functional category. Eighty of the induced and 15 of the repressed genes have not been studied so far. Among those uncharacterized ORFs are some of the most strongly induced genes, such as for instance YDL223"

Fatless mice have been created using dominant-negative protein (A-ZIP/F-1) targeted gene expression in the adipocyte and shown to develop diabetes. To understand the mechanism responsible for the insulin resistance in these mice, we conducted hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps in awake fatless and wild type littermates before the development of diabetes and examined insulin action and signaling in muscle and liver. We found the fatless mice to be severely insulin-resistant, which could be attributed to defects in insulin action in muscle and liver. Both of these abnormalities were associated with defects in insulin activation of insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and a 2-fold increase in muscle and liver triglyceride content. We also show that upon transplantation of fat tissue into these mice, triglyceride content in muscle and liver returned to normal as does insulin signaling and action. In conclusion, these results suggest that the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes may be due to alterations in the partitioning of fat between the adipocyte and muscle/liver leading to accumulation of triglyceride in the latter tissues with subsequent impairment of insulin signaling and action."

Cbfa1-deficient mice showed a complete lack of bone formation due to the maturational arrest of osteoblasts, demonstrating that Cbfa1 is an essential factor for osteoblast differentiation. Further, chondrocyte maturation was severely disturbed in Cbfa1-deficient mice. In this study, we examined the possibility that Cbfa1 is also involved in the regulation of chondrocyte differentiation. mRNAs for both Cbfa1 isotypes, type I Cbfa1 (Pebp2Œ±A/Cbfa1) and type II Cbfa1 (Osf2/Cbfa1 or til-1), which are different in N-terminal domain, were expressed in terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes as well as osteoblasts. In addition, mRNA for type I Cbfa1 was expressed in other hypertrophic chondrocytes and prehypertrophic chondropcytes. In a chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5, the expression of type I Cbfa1 was elevated prior to differentiation to the hypertrophic phenotype, which is characterized by type X collagen expression. Treatment with antisense oligonucleotides for type I Cbfa1 severely reduced type X collagen expression in ATDC5 cells. Retrovirally forced expression of either type I or type II Cbfa1 in chick immature chondrocytes induced type X collagen and MMP13 expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, and extensive cartilage-matrix mineralization.

Although two translational start sites were originally reported in the transcript starting from exon 1, the second ATG was extremely efficient for translation (11.Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M.

In endochondral ossification, skeletal formation begins with the condensation of mesenchymal cells and their differentiation into chondrocytes, forming a cartilage template. These chondrocytes then undergo a program of proliferation and maturation. The maturational process of chondrocytes can be defined by the expression of extracellular matrix genes as well as chondrocyte morphology. Prechondrogenic cells express type I collagen, and the induction of type II collagen occurs with the change of cellular phenotype from prechondrogenic cells to proliferating chondrocytes (13.Kosher R.A. Kulyk W.M. Gay S.W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1151-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The expression of type X collagen is restricted in hypertrophic chondrocytes, and the induction of type X collagen mRNA is regarded as signaling the change in cellular phenotype from proliferating chondrocytes to hypertrophic chondrocytes (14.Gerstenfeld L.C. Landis W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 104: 1435-1441Google Scholar).

In this study, we investigated Cbfa1expression in chondrocyte maturation and found that Cbfa1mRNA was detected in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes as well as in osteoblasts.

We show that antisense oligonucleotides for Cbfa1 suppressed the differentiation of ATDC5 cells into hypertrophic chondrocytes and that the introduction of either type I or type II Cbfa1 isotypes into immature primary chondrocytes markedly induced their differentiation to hypertrophic chondrocytes, indicating that Cbfa1 plays a crucial role in chondrocyte maturation. Four Cbfa1 cDNA probes (probes A, B, C, and D) were used for Northern blot analysis orin situ hybridization (see Fig. 1).

Digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled single-stranded RNA probes were prepared using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

A chondrogenic cell line, ATDC5, was purchased from the RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba Science City, Japan). ATDC5 cells were cultured in DMEM/Ham's F-12 (1:1) hybrid medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Life Technologies), 10 Œºg/ml human transferrin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 3 √ó 10‚àí8m sodium selenite (Sigma).

RNA was extracted from cultured cells when ATDC5 cells became confluent (4 days after plating) and then extracted every 3 days after confluence. Chicken embryo fibroblasts were obtained from the torso of virus-free White Leghorn 11-day-old embryos (line M) (Nisseiken, Yamanashi, Japan) and cultured in medium 199 containing 10% FBS. Chondrocytes were isolated from one-third of a caudal portion of 17-day-old embryo (line M) sternum and cultured in high glucose DMEM containing 10% FBS as described previously (19.Leboy P.S.

Total RNA was extracted using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), and poly(A) RNA was extracted from about 200 Œºg of total RNA using Dynabeads mRNA DIRECT kit (DYNAL A.S, Oslo, Norway) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mouse cDNAs described above were labeled with [Œ±-32P]dCTP, and hybridization was performed as described previously (15.Inada M. Yasui T. Nomura S. Miyake S. Deguchi K. Himeno M. Sato M.

Each membrane was rehybridized with Œ±-32P-labeled GAPDH cDNA. The intensities ofCbfa1, type X collagen, and GAPDH bands were quantitated by densitometry using FMBIO Analysis software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co. Ltd., Japan). For antisense studies, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides (S-oligos) were commercially synthesized (BEX Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). ATDC5 cells were plated at a density of 1 √ó 105 cells/well in six-well plates, and S-oligos (10 Œºm) were added every day with fresh medium during the period from day 0 to 11 (with day 0 as confluence).The sequences of the antisense (AS) S-oligos, sense (SE) S-oligos, and control-scrambled (CS) S-oligos are as follows: AS for type I Cbfa1 (5‚Ä≤-CTACAGGAATACGCA-3‚Ä≤), SE for type I Cbfa1 (5‚Ä≤-TGCGTATTCCTGTAG-3‚Ä≤), CS for type I Cbfa1 (5‚Ä≤-CACGAACTAGACAGT-3‚Ä≤), AS for type II Cbfa1 (5‚Ä≤-CTGCGCTGAAGAGGCTGTTTGA-3‚Ä≤), SE for type II Cbfa1 (5‚Ä≤-TCAAACAGCCTCTTCAGCGCAG-3‚Ä≤), CS for type II Cbfa1 (5‚Ä≤-CGCGTATCGTGATGTAGACGTG-3‚Ä≤) (6.Ducy P.

Competitors for type I and type II Cbfa1 cDNA were generated with Amp Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) and a Gene Amp PCR system 2400 (Perkin-Elmer) (30 s at 94 ¬∞C, 30 s at 63 ¬∞C, and 30 s at 72 ¬∞C) using the following primers: competitor for type I Cbfa1 (5‚Ä≤-GCACCGCCGAGATGGACTGCTGAAGGCCCCTACTGCAAGCTGTTA-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-GGCGGAAAGAGGATGGAGGTGACG-3‚Ä≤) and competitor for type II Cbfa1 (5‚Ä≤-GAGGGCACAAGTTCTATCTGGACAGCAGCCTGCAGCCCGGCAAGA-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-GGTGGTCCGCGATGATGTC-3‚Ä≤). After gel purification by standard techniques, serial dilutions of the PCR products were added to the samples as competitors. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells, and first-strand cDNA was made as described previously (15.Inada M. Yasui T. Nomura S. Miyake S. Deguchi K. Himeno M. Sato M. Yamagiwa H. Kimura T.

PCR procucts were electrophoresed and quantitated. If the amplified bands were faint or difficult to recognize, PCR cycling was increased to 45 cycles. cDNAs including entire coding sequences of mouse type I or type II Cbfa1, in which the Kozak consensus sequence CCACC is attached to the 5‚Ä≤-end of ATG (23.Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar), were recently used for the functional analysis of Cbfa1 isotypes (12.Harada H. Tagashira S. Fujiwara M. Ogawa S.

Type I and type II cDNAs were each subcloned into the RCAS retroviral vector (24.Hughes S.H. Greenhouse J.J. Petropoulos C.J. Sutrave P. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3004-3012Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Constructed vectors were transfected into chicken fibroblasts by the FuGENE6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The recombinant virus in the medium was concentrated by centrifugal concentrators and used to infect freshly isolated chondrocytes (25.Iwamoto M. Yagami K. Valle P. Lu Olsen B.R. Petropoulos C.J.

To detect APase activity, cultures were washed with saline twice, incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, containing 0.5 mg/ml of naphtol AS-BI phosphate and 1 mg/ml of Fast Red trisodium salts (Sigma) for 15 min at 37 ¬∞C, and then fixed with 3.7% neutralized formaldehyde solution. For determination of expression of the constructed genes, cultures were harvested by trypsinization and replated on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes at a density of 2.0 √ó 106 cells/ml. After 15 min, the cultures were washed with PBS twice, fixed with 3.7% neutralized formaldehyde solution, and permeabilized by incubation with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Cultures were then incubated with the polyclonal antibody (aA1c17) raised against a recombinant polypeptide fragment of mouse Cbfa1 (amino acids 359‚Äì513) (26.Lu J. Maruyama M. Satake M. Bae S.C. Ogawa E. Kagoshima H. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Localization of the antibody was visualized by ABC methods using Histofine kits (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). To detect calcium accumulation, the cultures were washed with saline and fixed with 95% ethanol. Alizarine red staining (27.Dahl L.K. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1952; 80: 474-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and von Kossa staining were then carried out. To detect type X collagen, the cultures were washed with saline, fixed with 70% ethanol, and incubated with antibody to chicken type X collagen (28.Oettinger H.F. Pacifici M. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 191: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and then with rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the virus-infected cultures (P1 cultures) according to the method previously described (29.Kawabe Y. Suzuki T. Hayashi M. Hamakubo T. Sato R. Kodama T. Biochimica. Biophysica. Acta. 1999; 1436: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 10 Œºg of nuclear extract was separated on a 10.0% gel by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Japan, Tokyo, Japan). After blocking the membrane with 10% horse serum overnight at 22 ¬∞C, the membrane was incubated with polyclonal rabbit antibody (aA1c17) against Cbfa1 and then with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG goat antibody (Biomedical Technologies Inc., Stoughton, MA). Cultures were harvested in saline solution containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.02 n NaOH and sonicated. Cell lysates were then centrifuged, and the supernatant was used for the determination of DNA by the fluorometric procedure of Johnson-Wint and Wellis (30.Johnson-Wint B. Wellis S. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To evaluate cartilage-specific proteoglycan synthesis, sulfated glycosaminoglycan, a major component of the proteoglycan, was measured by direct spectrophotometric microassay (31.Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1982; 9: 247-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). APase activity of the cell layer was measured as described previously (4.Komori T. Yagi H.

Total RNA from chick chondrocyte cultures was reverse transcribed and amplified for 30 cycles with a Gene Amp PCR system 2400 (10 s at 95 ¬∞C and 1 min at 60 ¬∞C) using the following primers: chick type IX collagen (5‚Ä≤-ATTCTGGGTGCTCGTCAAAGAAC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-AGCACTGAGAAGCCATCAACACT-3‚Ä≤) (32.Vasios G.

Cbfa1 has two isotypes with different N-terminal domains, one starting from exon 2, which we designated type I Cbfa1 (originally cloned as Pebp2Œ±A) (2.Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Lu J. Satake M. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6859-6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar), and the other starting from exon 1, designated type II Cbfa1 (originally cloned as Osf2/Cbfa1 or til-1) (6.Ducy P. Zhang R.

Onions D.E. Neil J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8646-8651Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (Fig.1). We first investigated the expression of these isotypes of Cbfa1 in growth plates of tibia at E16.5 mice byin situ hybridization. To distinguish the mRNAs for type I and type II Cbfa1, we used four probes (A, B, C, and D). Probe A, which hybridizes with an untranslated region in exon 8 and recognizes mRNAs for both type I and type II Cbfa1, detected Cbfa1transcripts strongly in osteoblasts and hypertrophic chondrocytes near the vascular invasion front (terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes) and weakly in other hypertrophic chondrocytes and prehypertrophic chondrocytes (Fig. 2, A andB). Similar results were obtained using probe B, which hybridizes with the translated region 3‚Ä≤ of runt domain and also recognizes mRNAs for both type I and type II Cbfa1 (Fig. 2,D and E). When we used probe C, which hybridizes with an untranslated region in exon 2 and specifically recognizes the mRNA for type I Cbfa1, Cbfa1 expression was similarly detected compared with that detected by probes A and B (Fig. 2, G andH). Probe D, which hybridizes with exon 1 and specifically recognizes the mRNA for type II Cbfa1, detected Cbfa1 transcripts strongly in osteoblasts and terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes, whereas the hybridization signals in other hypertrophic chondrocytes and prehypertrophic chondrocytes were faint (Fig. 2, J andK). Thus, the mRNAs for both Cbfa1 isotypes (types I and II) were expressed in osteoblasts, whereas the mRNA for type I Cbfa1 was expressed in chondrocytes with maturational stages ranging from prehypertrophic to terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes. The prominent expression of type II Cbfa1 in chondrocytes was restricted in terminal hypertrophic chondrocytes. The expression of Cbfa1 in chondrocytes led us to the hypothesis that Cbfa1 plays an important role in chondrocyte differentiation. To examine this possibility, we first investigated the relation between Cbfa1 expression and chondrocyte differentiation using the chondrogenic cell line ATDC5, an in vitro model for chondrogenesis (17.Atsumi T. Miwa Y. Kimata K. Ikawa Y. Cell Differ. Dev. 1990; 30: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 35.Akiyama H. Hiraki Y. Sigeno C. Kohno H. Shukunami C. Tuboyama T. Kasai R. Suzuki F. Konishi J. Nakamura T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated ATDC5 cells began to form cartilage nodule 3 days after confluence. Type I collagen mRNA was detectable when the cells reached confluence (day 0) but was not detected at 3 days after confluence (day 3) (Fig.3 A). In contrast, type II collagen mRNA was detected at day 3 and increased during culture. Type X collagen mRNA began to be detected at day 9 and increased during culture. We examined Cbfa1 expression during ATDC5 cell differentiation. Using probe A (see Fig. 1), two bands were detected until day 3, but after day 6 three bands were detected (Fig.3 A). To distinguish the two mRNAs for type I and II Cbfa1, we used probe C and probe D for Northern blot analysis (Fig.3 B). Among the three bands detected at day 6 using probe A, the two higher bands were detected and the lowest band was barely detectable using probe C, whereas only the lowest band was detected using probe D. These results indicate that the higher two bands contain mainly mRNA for type I Cbfa1, while the lowest band contains mainly mRNA for type II Cbfa1. The intensities of the lowest bands were similar during culture, but those of the higher two bands increased 4-fold at day 6 and were maintained after day 6 (Fig. 3 A). These data indicate that mRNA for type I Cbfa1 increased before the onset of type X collagen expression. To investigate the role of Cbfa1 in chondrocyte differentiation, we examined whether the down-regulation of Cbfa1 by treatment with twoCbfa1 antisense oligonucleotides, one for type I Cbfa1 and the other for type II Cbfa1, affects the differentiation of ATDC5 cells. First, we compared the amounts of mRNA for type I and type II Cbfa1 using competitive RT-PCR analysis (Fig.4) after the treatment of control-scrambled or sense oligonucleotides from day 0 to day 11 (with day 0 as confluence; see Fig. 3 A). In the competitive RT-PCR analysis of mRNA for type I Cbfa1, the equivalent points, in which similar intensities of the bands of cDNA and competitor are detected (see Fig. 4, B and C), were observed between 1 √ó 10‚àí1 and 3 √ó 10‚àí2(roughly 6 √ó 10‚àí2) dilutions of competitor when cells were treated with control-scrambled or sense oligonucleotides for type I Cbfa1 (Fig. 5 A). In the competitive RT-PCR analysis of mRNA for type II Cbfa1, the equivalent points were observed at a 1 √ó 10‚àí2dilution of competitor in the treatment of control-scrambled or sense oligonucleotides for type II Cbfa1 (Fig.6 A). Therefore, the amount of mRNA for type I Cbfa1 was several times greater in ATDC5 cells at day 11 than that for type II Cbfa1, and a similar ratio was observed at day 12 by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 A).Figure 6Effect of antisense oligonucleotides for type II Cbfa1 in ATDC5 cell differentiation to hypertrophic phenotype.ATDC5 cells were treated with 10 Œºm of CS, SE, and AS oligonucle"
https://openalex.org/W2092271417,"A novel animal model of insulin resistance, the fructose-fed Syrian golden hamster, was employed to investigate the mechanisms mediating the overproduction of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the insulin resistant state. Fructose feeding for a 2-week period induced significant hypertriglyceridemia and hyperinsulinemia, and the development of whole body insulin resistance was documented using the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. In vivo Triton WR-1339 studies showed evidence of VLDL-apoB overproduction in the fructose-fed hamster. Fructose feeding induced a significant increase in cellular synthesis and secretion of total triglyceride (TG) as well as VLDL-TG by primary hamster hepatocytes. Increased TG secretion was accompanied by a 4.6-fold increase in VLDL-apoB secretion. Enhanced stability of nascent apoB in fructose-fed hepatocytes was evident in intact cells as well as in a permeabilized cell system. Analysis of newly formed lipoprotein particles in hepatic microsomes revealed significant differences in the pattern and density of lipoproteins, with hepatocytes derived from fructose-fed hamsters having higher levels of luminal lipoproteins at a density of VLDL versus controls. Immunoblot analysis of the intracellular mass of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, a key enzyme involved in VLDL assembly, showed a striking 2.1-fold elevation in hepatocytes derived from fructose-fed versus control hamsters. Direct incubation of hamster hepatocytes with various concentrations of fructose failed to show any direct stimulation of its intracellular stability or extracellular secretion, further supporting the notion that the apoB overproduction in the fructose-fed hamster may be related to the fructose-induced insulin resistance in this animal model. In summary, hepatic VLDL-apoB overproduction in fructose-fed hamsters appears to result from increased intracellular stability of nascent apoB and an enhanced expression of MTP, which act to facilitate the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoprotein particles."

Although hENT1 and hENT2 are predicted to be 50-kDa proteins, hENT1 runs as 40 kDa and hENT2 migrates as 50 and 47 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Peptide N-glycosidase F and endoglycosidase H deglycosylate hENT1 to 37 kDa and hENT2 to 45 kDa. With hENT1 being more sensitive, there is a 7000-fold and 71-fold difference in sensitivity to nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR) (IC(50), 0.4 +/- 0.1 nM versus 2.8 +/- 0.3 microM) and dipyridamole (IC(50), 5.0 +/- 0.9 nM versus 356 +/- 13 nM), respectively. [(3)H]NBMPR binds to ENT1 cells with a high affinity K(d) of 0.377 +/- 0.098 nM, and each ENT1 cell has 34,000 transporters with a turnover number of 46 molecules/s for uridine. Although both transporters are broadly selective, hENT2 is a generally low affinity nucleoside transporter with 2.6-, 2.8-, 7. 7-, and 19.3-fold lower affinity than hENT1 for thymidine, adenosine, cytidine, and guanosine, respectively. In contrast, the affinity of hENT2 for inosine is 4-fold higher than hENT1. The nucleobase hypoxanthine inhibits [(3)H]uridine uptake by hENT2 but has minimal effect on hENT1. Taken together, these results suggest that hENT2 might be important in transporting adenosine and its metabolites (inosine and hypoxanthine) in tissues such as skeletal muscle where ENT2 is predominantly expressed."

To analyze the mechanism of regulation of ligand-activated AhR, we examined the biochemical pathway and function of the down-regulation of the receptor by TCDD. Pulse-chase experiments reveal that TCDD shortens the half-life (t 12) of AhR from 28 to 3 h in mouse hepatoma cells. Inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome, lactacystin and MG132, block the TCDD-induced turnover of AhR. The TCDD-induced degradation of AhR involves ubiquitination of the AhR protein, because (a) TCDD induces formation of high molecular weight, ubiquitinated AhR and (b) degradation of AhR is inhibited in ts20 cells, which bear a temperature-sensitive mutation in the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, at a nonpermissive temperature. Inhibition of proteasomal degradation of AhR increases the amount of the nuclear AhR¬∑Arnt complex and ‚Äúsuperinduces‚Äù the expression of endogenous CYP1A1 gene by TCDD, indicating that the proteasomal degradation of AhR serves as a mechanism for controlling the activity of the activated receptor. We also show that deletion of the transcription activation domain of AhR abolishes the degradation, whereas a mutation in the DNA-binding region of AhR or Arnt reduces the degradation; these data implicate the transcription activation domain and DNA binding in AhR degradation.

The activated AhR translocates into the nucleus, dimerizes with Arnt, another bHLH/PAS transcription factor, and activates the transcription of target genes by binding to specific enhancer sequences in the regulatory region of the genes; transcription of a target gene involves disruption of the chromatin structures associated with the gene (for review see Ref. 1.Whitlock Jr., J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 103-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Signal-activated transcription factors are often regulated in cells after activation so that the transcriptional response can be controlled to meet the need of cellular homeostasis. Degradation of a protein through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has been shown to be involved in the regulation of many cellular proteins, including transcription factors, such as p53, NF-Œ∫B, IŒ∫BŒ±, c-Jun, c-Myc, and estrogen receptor Œ± (19.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar, 20.Varshavsky A. Trends Biochem.

Proteasomal degradation of a protein involves covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a 76-residue peptide molecule, to the target protein. Repeated rounds of ubiquitination result in a highly ubiquitinated target protein that is rapidly degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Alternatively, ubiquitination can occur on an associated protein, which assists recognition of the target protein by the proteasome system. Ubiquitination of a protein is catalyzed by a multi enzyme system(s) that includes the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and the ubiquitin ligase (E3), on a specific structural element(s) of the protein called a ‚Äúdegron.‚Äù Selective degron recognition and subsequent ubiquitination of lysine residues by specific E2 and E3 is central to the specificity and regulation of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Several observations suggest that AhR is regulated after activation by an agonist. For example, treatment of cells with TCDD causes a time-dependent reduction in the DNA binding activity of the nuclear AhR¬∑Arnt complex (23.Reick M. Robertson R.W. Pasco D.S. Fagan J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5653-5660Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and down-regulation in the steady state level of AhR in cultured cells (24.Pollenz R.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of this down-regulation remains unclear. Recent evidence obtained by using inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome (MG132) and nuclear export (leptomycin B) suggests that the proteasome and nuclear export are involved in the reduction of steady state AhR by TCDD (25.Davarinos N. Pollanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28708-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). However, direct evidence of AhR degradation by TCDD (i.e. changes in the half-life of AhR) is lacking, and whether TCDD induces ubiquitination of AhR has not been addressed. In this study, we analyzed the biochemical pathway and functional implication of AhR degradation by TCDD. Our results reveal that activation of AhR by TCDD induces a marked shortening of the half-life (t 12) of the receptor through degradation of the receptor by the 26 S proteasome. The proteasomal degradation of AhR involves ubiquitination of AhR. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome enhances the induction ofCYP1A1 by TCDD, implicating the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in controlling the activity of ligand-activated AhR. Furthermore, we show that AhR degradation requires the transcription activation (TA) domain and DNA binding activity of AhR. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism by which AhR is regulated through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after activation by a ligand.

The AhR-D cells expressing AhR, AhR1‚Äì515, or AhRR39A and the Arnt-D cells expressing Arnt, Arnt1‚Äì652, or ArntR87A were originally from the laboratory of Dr. J. P. Whitlock, Jr. Generation of these cell lines by using the MFG retroviral expression system and characterization of the cell lines for AhR or Arnt function were described previously (26.Ko H.P.

The cells were grown as a monolayer in Œ±-minimal essential medium, containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and 5% CO2, as described elsewhere (29.Miller A.G. Israel D.L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3523-3527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E36 and ts20 cells (provided by Dr. R. R. Kopito, Stanford University) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5% CO2, at the indicated temperatures. Cells were treated with TCDD (AccuStandard, New Haven, CT) or other reagents as described in the figure legends. Me2SO (0.1%) was used as the vehicle control for TCDD. Lactacystin, MG132, proteasome inhibitor I, calpastatin, and PD150606 were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). Chloroquine, aprotinin, leupeptin, and PMSF were from Sigma. Treatment involving protease inhibitors was for 5 h or less to avoid toxicity to the cells; over 90% of the cells were viable under the experimental conditions. Transfection of pRc/CMV (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) or pAhR/CMV (30.Ma Q. Dong L. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12697-12703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) into E36 and ts20 cells was performed with the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), followed by selection with G418 (400 Œºg/ml) for 10 days. Stable transfectants from the same transfection were pooled for further analysis. AhR1‚Äì421 was expressed by using the Retro-X System (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), according to protocols from CLONTECH. Briefly, AhR cDNA encoding residues 1‚Äì421 was subcloned into the pLNCX vector to generate pAhR1‚Äì421/LNCX, which was transfected into the RetroPack PT67 packaging cells by using the calcium method. 48 h after transfection, the supernatant was collected and used to infect the AhR-D cells. The cells expressing AhR1‚Äì421 were enriched by selection in the presence of G418 (400 Œºg/ml) for 10 days. Total cell extracts were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with antibodies according to established procedures (31.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). For immunoblotting of AhR, an affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against the mouse AhR was used (14.Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as the secondary antibody. The blots were visualized by chemiluminescence using the ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same blots were reprobed with a monoclonal anti-actin IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Promega) and color visualization using the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate toluidinium/nitroblue tetrazolium substrate system (Promega). The amount of actin detected in the blots was used as an internal control to ensure equal loading of the samples. For immunodetection of ubiquitinated AhR, the AhR protein was immunoprecipitated with the anti-AhR antibodies as described below. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE at 70 volts and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes by overnight transfer at 200 mA. The blots were denatured in a buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF) for 1 h, blocked with 5% albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with a mouse monoclonal IgG against ubiquitin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) overnight, and detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Promega) and the ECL kit. AhR was precipitated with the anti-AhR antibodies according to a standard method (31.Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1998Google Scholar). Briefly, cells grown in 6-well plates were scraped into RIPA buffer (1% Ipegal CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 Œºm PMSF, and 10 Œºg/ml aprotinin in phosphate buffered saline). Cell extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 13,000 √ó g for 10 min, followed by preclearing by incubation with a normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and protein A-agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 ¬∞C. The extracts were incubated with the anti-AhR antibodies (14.Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2144-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 28.Dong L. Ma Q. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7942-7948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for 1 h and then with protein A-agarose for an additional hour. The precipitated agarose beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer and resuspended in a loading buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Cells grown to near confluence were incubated in methionine-free medium with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 1 h and were labeled in a fresh supplemented, methionine-free medium plus [35S]methionine (100 ŒºCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h. The cells were then incubated in supplemented Œ±-minimal essential medium, treated with TCDD or Me2SO for various time periods, and scraped into RIPA buffer. The35S-labeled AhR was precipitated with the anti-AhR antibodies, fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and visualized by fluorography. Total RNA was isolated from cells by using a Qiagen total RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA samples of 5 Œºg each were fractionated in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Nytran membrane. The blot was probed with a DIG-labeled riboprobe prepared with the DIG-labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), which recognizes a 700-base pair fragment in the 5‚Ä≤-untranslated region of the mouse CYP1A1 mRNA. Signals were visualized by chemiluminescence using a DIG RNA detection kit with CDP star as a substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Parallel blots of the same samples were probed with a DIG-labeled actin probe to ensure equal loading. EMSA was carried out by using nuclear extracts prepared from hepa1c1c7 cells, as described previously (32.Denison M.S. Fisher J.M. Whitlock Jr., J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2528-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), except that 6% polyacrylamide gels were used. The DNA probe contains the DNA recognition sequence for the AhR¬∑Arnt heteromer, designated DRE D (33.Lusska A. Shen E. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6575-6580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe was labeled with [Œ≥-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The nuclear extracts were incubated with poly(dI-dC) for 15 min at room temperature. The 32P-labeled probe was then added and incubated for another 15 min at room temperature, followed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The AhR¬∑Arnt¬∑DRE complex was visualized by autoradiography. TCDD, a potent agonist of the Ah receptor, both activates AhR and induces a marked reduction in the steady state level of the receptor. As shown in Fig. 1 A, treatment of hepa1c1c7 cells with TCDD (1 nm, 5 h) results in reduction of steady state AhR to less than 10% of the control, whereas the level of the Arnt protein is not affected. To analyze the biochemical pathway of TCDD-induced down-regulation of the AhR protein, we measured the half-life of unliganded and TCDD-activated AhR by using pulse-chase experiments to test whether the down-regulation is due to an increase in the turnover of the receptor. After pulse-labeling of the mouse hepa1c1c7 cells with [35S]methionine, the AhR protein was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against AhR, resolved in SDS-PAGE, and visualized by fluorography. As shown in Fig. 1 (B andC), the AhR of untreated cells is relatively stable with a half-life (t 12) of about 28 h. Treatment with 1 nm TCDD reduces the t 12 to 3 h. The time course for the reduction of the pulse-labeled AhR by TCDD is similar to that of the steady state level of AhR (data not shown). Thus, TCDD treatment markedly increases the turnover of AhR, accounting for the down-regulation of steady state AhR by TCDD. Signal-induced degradation of cellular proteins is often mediated through a specific proteolytic system(s), such as the 26 S proteasome (19.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar) or calpains (34.Han Y. Weinman S. Boldogh I. Walker R.K. Braisier A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 787-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To identify the proteolytic activity for the TCDD-induced degradation of AhR, we tested a panel of inhibitors that specifically inhibit the 26 S proteasome, calpains, lysosomal enzymes, and other proteases. Immunoblot analyses reveal that co-treatment of the cells with TCDD (1 nm) and lactacystin, an irreversible, potent and specific proteasome inhibitor (19.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar), or MG132, a reversible, potent but less specific proteasome inhibitor (35.Adams J. Stein R. Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 1996; 31: 279-283Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar), inhibits the TCDD-induced reduction of AhR in a dose-dependent manner; maximal inhibition occurs at a concentration of 20 Œºm lactacystin or 25 ŒºmMG132 (Fig. 2 A). Others have observed a similar effect with MG132 via immunoblotting of AhR (25.Davarinos N. Pollanz R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28708-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To directly test whether the 26 S proteasome is required in the TCDD-induced AhR degradation, pulse-chase experiments were performed to analyze the effect of the proteasomal inhibitors on the turnover of pulse-labeled AhR. As shown in Fig. 2 B, when co-treated with TCDD, both lactacystin and MG132 block the degradation of pulse-labeled Ah receptor by TCDD (compare treatments of Me2SO, TCDD, and TCDD plus lactacystin or MG132). These results provide a direct proof that the TCDD-induced AhR degradation requires the 26 S proteasome. It has been shown in vitro that AhR in the cytoplasmic preparations of mouse liver and hepatoma cells is rapidly degraded through a Ca2+-dependent, calpain II-like protease process (36.Poland A. Glover E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 261: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To analyze the role of calpains and other proteases in TCDD-induced degradation of AhR in intact cells, we examined the effect of inhibitors of calpains and other cellular proteases on AhR degradation. Fig.3 A shows that co-treatment with TCDD and calpastatin or PD150606, specific inhibitors of calpains (37.Khissiin A. Leclercq G. FEBS Lett. 1999; 448: 160-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 38.Wang K. Nath R. Posner A., K.R. Buroker-Kilgore M. Hajimohammadreza I. Probert Jr., A. Marcoux F. Ye Q. Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. Caner H. Collins J. Fergus A. Lee K. Lunney E. Hays S. Yuen P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6687-6692Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), does not inhibit the degradation of AhR by TCDD. Inhibitors of lysosomal proteases (chloroquine), serine proteases (PMSF and aprotinin), and serine/cysteine proteases (leupeptin) do not exhibit inhibitory activity toward the TCDD-induced AhR degradation (Fig.3 B). Collectively, these results indicate that the 26 S proteasome mediates the TCDD-induced turnover of AhR in intact cells. Degradation of a specific protein by the 26 S proteasome is often preceeded by ubiquitination of the protein through a multi-component, ubiquitin enzyme system. This modification serves as a marker, which targets the protein to the proteasome for degradation (21.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 22.Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Proteasomal degradation of proteins not ubiquitinated may require a secondary, ubiquitinated protein that functions to assist in directing the target proteins to the 26 S proteasome for degradation. To analyze the mechanism of the proteasomal degradation of AhR, we examined whether TCDD induces ubiquitination of AhR. As shown in Fig.4 A, TCDD treatment induces accumulation of high molecular weight, ubiquitinated proteins, that are recognized by a monoclonal antibody specific for ubiquitin, as compared with the Me2SO control. To test whether AhR is ubiquitinated in response to TCDD, AhR from control and TCDD-treated cells was immunoprecipitated with an anti-AhR antibody and blot analyzed with the anti-ubiquitin antibody. Fig. 4 B shows that TCDD induces the formation of high molecular weight forms of AhR that are immunoprecipitated with the anti-AhR antibody and recognized by the anti-ubiquitin antibody. In a separate experiment, AhR was immunoprecipitated and blotted with the anti-AhR antibody; the data reveal that TCDD treatment results in both accumulation of high molecular weight AhR and reduction of the native, nonubiquitinated AhR (data not shown). Together, these findings indicate that TCDD induces ubiquitination of the AhR protein. Next, we examined whether ubiquitination of AhR is required for AhR degradation by TCDD. Because ubiquitination of a target protein requires activation of the ubiquitin molecule by E1, cells defective in E1 are compromised in protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (39.Ward C. Omura S. Kopito R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar, 40.Kulka R. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the degradation of AhR in cells bearing a temperature-sensitive mutation in E1. Mouse AhR was expressed in wild type (E36) and temperature-sensitive mutant cells (ts20) by stable transfection. E36 and ts20 cells transfected with vector only express low levels of AhR (Fig.5, lanes 3, 4,11, and 12). At 31 ¬∞C, the cells transfected with the pAhR/CMV plasmid express the AhR protein to a level lower than that of the mouse hepa1c1c7 cells. Interestingly, the level of AhR in untreated ts20 cells at 40 ¬∞C (nonpermissive temperature for E1 function in ts20) is 3-fold higher than that at 31 ¬∞C (permissive temperature for E1) (compare lanes 13 and 15), suggesting that E1 negatively controls the AhR level in untreated cells. Treatment of E36 cells with TCDD induces degradation of AhR at both 31 and 40 ¬∞C. However, TCDD induces degradation of AhR in ts20 cells only at 31 ¬∞C but not at 40 ¬∞C. These findings implicate E1 in the degradation of AhR in both untreated and TCDD-treated cells. Thus, both biochemical and genetic studies indicate that the degradation of AhR by TCDD involves ubiquitination of the AhR protein. The fact that TCDD induces both activation and degradation of the Ah receptor raises the question of whether the TCDD-induced degradation of AhR serves as a means of controlling the activity of ligand-activated AhR in the nucleus. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of proteasome inhibitors on the induction of endogenous CYP1A1 gene expression by TCDD, a well characterized transcriptional response mediated by AhR. As shown in Fig. 6 A, TCDD inducesCYP1A1 gene expression, whereas co-treatment with TCDD (1 nm) and lactacystin (20 Œºm) or MG132 (25 Œºm) for 5 h enhances the induction to 4.0- or 3.5-fold higher (compare lanes 4 and 8 withlane 2). Proteasome inhibitor I, a weaker proteasome inhibitor than lactacystin and MG132, also enhances the induction ofCYP1A1, when added at a concentration of 25 Œºm(‚àº3.0-fold). PMSF, an inhibitor of serine proteases, does not affect the induction (compare lanes 2 and 10). Therefore, inhibition of proteasomal degradation of AhR by TCDD superinduces CYP1A1 gene expression. We next examined, via EMSA, whether inhibition of AhR degradation increases the formation of the functional AhR¬∑Arnt complex in the nucleus, thereby serving as a mechanism for the superinduction of CYP1A1 expression. Fig.6 B shows that MG132 enhances the TCDD-induced gel mobility shift, which reflects the formation of the AhR¬∑Arnt¬∑DRE complex, dose-dependently, indicating that inhibition of the 26 S proteasome increases the amount of functional AhR in the nucleus. Taken together, these data suggest that the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of AhR plays an important role in controlling the amount and activity of agonist-activated Ah receptor in the nucleus. The observation that AhR, but not Arnt, is degraded by the proteasome upon TCDD treatment indicates that this TCDD-activated degradation pathway is specific for AhR. Because ubiquitination of a target protein involves a specific structural motif or degron that is central to the specificity of ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, we examined which regions of AhR are required for TCDD-induced degradation by deletion analysis. As shown in Fig. 7 A, TCDD induces degradation of AhR in wild type and AhR-defective variant cells (AhR-D), which contains ‚àº10% AhR as compared with wild type cells. Expression of wild type AhR in AhR-D by using retroviral gene transfer restores the AhR protein level and function (as measured in the induction of CYP1A1 by TCDD) (lane 5 and data not shown). The expressed AhR is degraded by TCDD (lane 6). However, a deletion mutant, AhR1‚Äì515, that lacks the C-terminal half of AhR (amino acid residues 516‚Äì805, consisting of the TA domain) but contains an intact bHLH/PAS domain (residues 1‚Äì340) i"

In this study, we report that UCN prevented cell death when administered to primary cardiac myocyte cultures both prior to simulated hypoxia/ischemia and at the point of reoxygenation after simulated hypoxia/ischemia. UCN-mediated cell survival was measured by trypan blue exclusion, 3‚Ä≤-OH end labeling of DNA (TUNEL), annexin V, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. To explore the mechanisms that could be responsible for this effect, we investigated the involvement of MAPK-dependent pathways. UCN caused rapid phosphorylation of ERK1/2-p42/44, and PD98059, which blocks the MEK1-ERK1/2-p42/44 cascade, also inhibited the survival-promoting effect of UCN. Most important, UCN reduced damage in isolated rat hearts ex vivo subjected to regional ischemia/reperfusion, with the protective effect being observed when UCN was given either prior to ischemia or at the time of reperfusion after ischemia.

In contrast, the R1 receptors show little ligand selectivity for UCNversus CRF. R2 receptors are the only type of CRF receptor found in the heart: the Œ± form in man (14.Chen R. Lewis K.A.

The CRF family of peptides have been shown to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in cardiac myocytes (16.Heldwein K.A. Redick D.L. Rittenberg M.B. Claycomb W.C. Stenzel-Poore M.P.

Asaba K. Takao T. Hashimoto K. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).The coincident expression of CRF-R2 receptors with their preferred UCN ligand in the heart suggests that UCN may have physiological cardiac properties. Indeed UCN, but not CRF, induces a dose-dependent increase in heart rate, cardiac output, and coronary blood flow (18.Parkes D.G. Vaughan J. Rivier J. Vale W. May C.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2115-H2122PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, cardiac CRF-R2Œ≤ expression is modulated by endotoxin, a potent inducer of cardiovascular dysregulation, further suggesting a possible link between UCN and the cardiovascular response to stress (19.Heldwein K.A.

The extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs), belonging to one subfamily of MAPKs, are composed of 42- and 44-kDa kinases named p42 ERK and p44 ERK, respectively. Phosphorylation and activation of p42 ERK and p44 ERK are mediated by the MAPKs MEK1 and MEK2.CRF has been shown to activate ERK1/2-p42/44 in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines transfected with CRF-R1 and CRF-R2 (30.Rossant C.J. Pinnock R.D. Hughes J. Hall M.D. McNulty S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the cardioprotective effects of cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) are mediated through gp130 receptor activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-p42/44 signaling cascade, one consequence of which is increased expression of the cardioprotective hsp70 and hsp90 proteins (31.Stephanou A.S.

Cardiol. 1998; 30: 849-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).In this report, we have extended our studies on the cardioprotective properties of UCN in primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes exposed to simulated ischemia/reoxygenation in vitro and show that UCN is also protective in isolated perfused rat heartsex vivo. In both in vitro and ex vivomodels, we show for the first time that this cardioprotective effect of UCN is retained when addition of UCN is delayed until after the simulated hypoxia/ischemia and is given during the reoxygenation/reperfusion. We also show that the protective effects involve activation of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2-p42/44 signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONCardiac muscle survival is of critical importance in maintaining the normal function of the heart. Adult cardiac muscle cells are terminally differentiated and have lost their ability to proliferate. Therefore, irreversible cardiac injury, e.g. following ischemia, results in scarring and eventual decrease in cardiac function. Identification of natural cardioprotective agents and the signaling pathways through which their cardioprotective effects are mediated is critical for the elucidation of the molecular basis of cardiac myocyte loss and rescue.In this study, we have extended our previous observations on the cardioprotective properties of UCN. In in vitro cultures of primary rat cardiac myocytes exposed to simulated hypoxia/ischemia followed by reoxygenation, exogenous UCN reduces cardiac myocyte cell death when added after the simulated hypoxia/ischemia and during the reoxygenation/reperfusion period as well as when added prior to the simulated hypoxia/ischemia (20.Brar B.K. Stephanou A. Okosi A. Lawrence K.M. Chowdry H.S. Knight R.K. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 158: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the ischemic/reperfused isolated heart ex vivo, UCN is also cardioprotective when added to the perfusate after ischemia and during reperfusion. Since clinical intervention is possible only after the acute ischemic episode, the data suggest that UCN and derivatives thereof may have a role in the management of human myocardial infarction.We have previously shown that UCN mRNA is expressed by both cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes and the adult rat heart, and not CRF, and that UCN transcripts are increased following simulated hypoxia/ischemia (20.Brar B.K. Stephanou A. Okosi A. Lawrence K.M. Chowdry H.S. Knight R.K. Latchman D.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 158: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). By Western blotting, we have also demonstrated the presence of the 22-kDa UCN precursor protein in cardiac myocytes (data not shown) and that the mature 40-amino acid UCN peptide is released into the supernatant of cardiac myocytes exposed to simulated hypoxia/ischemia. This is consistent with the cardioprotective effects of these supernatants being inhibited by CRFŒ±-(9‚Äì41), a receptor antagonist of all CRF family members at both CRF-R1 and CRF-R2, and suggests that endogenous cardiac UCN is released from ischemic cardiac myocytes and exerts an autocrine/paracrine protective effect through cardiac CRF-R2. We have also shown that UCN protects cardiac myocytes from ceramide-induced apoptosis. 2B. K. Brar, A. K. Jonassen, A. Stephanou, G. Santilli, J. Railson, R. A. Knight, D. M. Yellon, and D. S. Latchman, unpublished observations. There is increasing evidence that UCN and CRF peptides are involved in cell survival mechanisms of a number of cells. CRF administered to hypoxic rat brain slices results in neuroprotection when administered during the hypoxic episode (42.Fox M.W. Anderson R.E. Meyer F.B. Stroke. 1993; 24: 1072-1076Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of action appears to be a direct neuronal effect. Therefore, we suggest that UCN peptide release may serve as a mechanism to protect cells from hypoxia/ischemia-induced cell death.A number of studies have addressed which signaling and transactivating pathways are activated by ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion. In the heart, the p38 MAPKs and JNKs are induced by ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion (43.Yin T. Sandu G. Wolfgang C.D. Burrier A. Webb R.L. Rigel D.F. Hai T. Whelan J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 6272-6279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The JNK and p38 stress-activated pathways have been linked to an increase in cell death in ischemic and reoxygenated cardiac cells (49.Mackay K. Mochly-Rosen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6272-6279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). UCN failed to stimulate the phosphorylation and activation of both p38 and JNK. A highly specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580) failed to inhibit the cardioprotective effect of UCN in all experiments (data not shown). Our experiments show that UCN induces ERK1/2-p42/44 phosphorylation and that inhibition of MEK1/2, the upstream activator of these enzymes, inhibits the cardioprotective effect of UCN. The target cardioprotective genes or the post-translational events induced by UCN-mediated activation of ERK1/2-p42/44 are unknown. However, in other cells, ERK1 and ERK2 (p42/44) have been associated with the increased expression of FLICE (FADD-like interleukin 1b-converting enzyme) like inhibitory protein, an inhibitor of the caspase cascade (50.Yeh J.-H. Hsu S.-C. Hsu S.-H. Lai M.-Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Whether UCN mediates its cardioprotection by increasing the levels of FLICE-like inhibitory protein has yet to be determined.It is known that both hypoxia/ischemia and reoxygenation impose redox stress on cardiac tissue. Although coronary reperfusion itself results in tissue injury (51.Matusamara K. Jeremy R.W. Schaper J. Becker L.C. Circulation. 1998; 97: 795-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), it is the only means of limiting infarct size, provided that it occurs early after coronary occlusion. In this study, we report for the first time that UCN reduces damage to an intact rat heart exposed to regional ischemia when given at reperfusion, which would be essential in the clinical setting. Growth factors such as insulin have been shown to exert anti-apoptotic effects in these cells when administered during reperfusion. Insulin-like growth factor I (52.Buerke M. Murohra T. Skurk C. Nuss C. Tomaselli K. Lefer A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8031-8035Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and insulin (53.Jonassen, A. K., Brar, B. K. Mjos, O. D., Sack, M. N., Latchman, D. S., and Yellon, D. M. (2000) J. Mol. Cell Cardiol., in pressGoogle Scholar) have been shown to inhibit apoptosis and necrosis in cardiac myocytes. Both insulin-like growth factor I and insulin act through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and receptor tyrosine kinases as well as the MEK1-ERK1/2-p42/44 signaling cascade (54.Kulik G. Klippel A. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The benefit of UCN over these and other drugs will need to be investigated in the intact animal and human tissue.Some cardioprotective factors such as CT-1 (55.Sheng Z. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 419-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and angiotensin II and vasopressin (56.Hupf H. Grimm D. Riegger G.A.J. Schunkert H. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 365-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) are also potent inducers of hypertrophy. Hypertrophy is an adaptive response found in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease and results in molecular adaptations of both coronary vasculature and cardiac muscle. Initially, these responses to cardiac overload help to maintain cardiac output. However, prolonged hypertrophy eventually leads to cardiac failure (57.Katz A.M. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 121: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The hypertrophic response due to CT-1 is mediated by activation of Janus kinases with phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-3 (55.Sheng Z. Pennica D. Wood W.I. Chien K.R. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 419-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Janus kinase-STAT pathway has been implicated in hypertrophic responses of the heart (58.Kunisada K. Tone E. Fujio Y. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Kishimoto T. Circulation. 1998; 98: 346-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar); however, studies conducted in our laboratory failed to detect STAT-1 or STAT-3 tyrosine phosphorylation in cardiac myocytes induced by UCN or any increase in cardiac myocyte cell size using crystal violet staining. 3B. K. Brar and J. Railson, unpublished observations. These studies suggest that UCN, unlike CT-1, is a cardioprotective agent that does not induce a hypertrophic response. Moreover, although 100 Œºg of UCN administered to sheep produced changes in cardiac function (18.Parkes D.G. Vaughan J. Rivier J. Vale W. May C.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2115-H2122PubMed Google Scholar), no hemodynamic changes were observed in response to the lower doses of UCN used in the isolated rat hearts used in these experiments. A previous study on rats revealed that a subcutaneous injection of UCN caused a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure; hence, it acts as a hypotensive agent (59.Torpy D.J. Webster E.L. Zachman E.K. Aguilera G. Chrousos G.P. Neuroimmunomodulation. 1999; 6: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whether this finding will hinder its use as a therapeutic drug is not known, but will be addressed in future inin vivo models of cardiac failure.The recent availability of reliable and specific assays for the UCN peptide will enable accurate measurement of UCN release and expression in our models of hypoxic/ischemic and hypoxic/ischemic/reperfusion injury and in future human studies (46.Glynn B.P. Wolton A. Rodriguez-Linares B. Phaneuf S. Linton E.A. Am. J. Obstet. Gynecol. 1998; 179: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is already clear, however, that as well as the adaptive role in the response to external stressors, UCN is also an important mediator of the response to stress at the level of the cell. We believe that these results establish a new and potentially clinically important role for UCN in protection from cellular stress, in addition to the well known function of the CRF family of peptides in integrating the complex response to external physical and psychological stresses. The use of these peptides in salvaging neurons and other cell types that express CRF receptors, in addition to cardiac myocytes, from cell death induced by cellular stressors warrants further investigation. Urocortin (UCN)1 is a peptide related to the hypothalamic hormone corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), the central mediator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and stress response in mammals (1.Vale W. Spiess J. Rivier C. Rivier J. Science. 1981; 213: 1394-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (3993) Google Scholar, 2.De Souza E.B.

UCN and CRF share 45% homology at the amino acid level, and both are synthesized as precursors, which are subsequently processed to the mature biologically active peptides (in the case of UCN, a 40-amino acid molecule) (4.Vaughan J. Donaldson C. Bittencourt J. Perrin M.H. Lewis K. Sutton S. Chen R. Turnbull A.V. Lovejoy D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Sawchenko P.E. Vale W.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2167-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although UCN was originally identified in restricted areas of the brain, it has also been found in the placenta, lymphocytes, and heart (6.Iino K. Sasano H. Oki Y. Andoh N. Shin R.W. Kitamoto T.

Neuropeptides. 1998; 32: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The CRF family of peptides bind two types of CRF receptors, CRF-R1 and CRF-R2. CRF-R2 exists in three alternative splice variant forms, CRF-R2Œ±, CRF-R2Œ≤, and CRF-R2Œ≥ (10.Chang C.P. Pearse R.V. O'Connell S. Rosenfeld M.G.

Perrin M.H. Lewis K. Sutton S. Chen R. Turnbull A.V. Lovejoy D. Rivier C. Rivier J. Sawchenko P.E. Vale W. Nature. 1995; 378: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar) and as shown by the effects of ligand on intracellular cAMP (13.Gottowik J. Goetschy V. Henriot S. Kitas E. Fluhman B. Clerc R.G. Moreau J.L. Monsma F.J. Kilpatrick G.J. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1439-1446Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In contrast, the R1 receptors show little ligand selectivity for UCNversus CRF. R2 receptors are the only type of CRF receptor found in the heart: the Œ± form in man (14.Chen R. Lewis K.A. Perrin M.H. Vale W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8967-8971Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) and the Œ≤ form in the rat (15.Stenzel P. Keterson R. Yeung W. Cone R.D. Rittenberg M.B. Stenzel-Poore M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 637-645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CRF family of peptides have been shown to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity in cardiac myocytes (16.Heldwein K.A. Redick D.L. Rittenberg M.B. Claycomb W.C. Stenzel-Poore M.P. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and changes in CRF-R2 expression have been reported in the hearts of spontaneously hypertensive rats (17.Makina S. Asaba K. Takao T. Hashimoto K. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 515-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The coincident expression of CRF-R2 receptors with their preferred UCN ligand in the heart suggests that UCN may have physiological cardiac properties. Indeed UCN, but not CRF, induces a dose-dependent increase in heart rate, cardiac output, and coronary blood flow (18.Parkes D.G. Vaughan J. Rivier J. Vale W. May C.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H2115-H2122PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, cardiac CRF-R2Œ≤ expression is modulated by endotoxin, a potent inducer of cardiovascular dysregulation, further suggesting a possible link between UCN and the cardiovascular response to stress (19.Heldwein K.A. Duncan J.E. Stenzel P. Rittenberg M.B. Stenzel-Poore M.P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 131: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Indeed, in previous studies, we have shown that UCN mRNA expression increases in cardiac cells exposed to thermal and simulated hypoxic/ischemic injury stressin vitro (9.Okosi A. Brar B.K. Chan M.

Comparison of the ThiI sequence with protein sequences in the data bases revealed that the Escherichia coli enzyme contains a C-terminal extension displaying sequence similarity to the sulfurtransferase rhodanese. Cys-456 of ThiI aligns with the active site cysteine residue of rhodanese that transiently forms a persulfide during catalysis. We investigated the functional importance of this sequence similarity and discovered that, like rhodanese, ThiI catalyzes the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide. Mutation of Cys-456 to alanine impairs this sulfurtransferase activity, and the C456A ThiI is incapable of supporting generation of 4-thiouridine in tRNA both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore conclude that Cys-456 of ThiI is critical for activity and propose that Cys-456 transiently forms a persulfide during catalysis.

We report the further characterization of the function of ThiI from Escherichia coli, an enzyme that plays a role in the biosynthesis of both thiamin (8.Webb E. Claas K. Downs D.M. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The s4U has an absorbance maximum at 334 nm and serves as a near-UV photosensor, undergoing a photoactivated 2 + 2 cycloaddition with the carbon-carbon double bond of cytidine 13, which leads to a cross-link in the tRNA (10.Favre A. Yaniv M. Michelson A.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11.Bergstrom D.E. Leonard N.J.

Such cross-linked tRNAs are inefficient aminoacylation substrates (13.Carre D.S. Thomas G. Favre A. Biochimie (Paris). 1974; 56: 1089-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and the accumulation of uncharged tRNA triggers growth arrest (14.Ramabhadran T.V. Jagger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This role of s4U as a photosensor provides for a remarkably powerful selection: mutant bacteria that do not make s4U in tRNA continue to grow upon exposure to near-UV light (15.Kramer G.F. Baker J.C. Ames B.N. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2344-2351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Thomas G. Favre A. C. R. Seances Acad. Sci. Ser. D. 1977; 284: 1345-1347PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Lipsett M.N. J.

Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 899-904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the near-UV resistant phenotype can be complemented by a plasmid-borne functional copy of the defective chromosomal gene. Using this near-UV screen, the role of ThiI in s4U biosynthesis was demonstrated (9.Mueller E.G. Buck C.J. Palenchar P.M. Barnhart L.E. Paulson J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2606-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as was the functional importance of a catalytically critical ‚ÄúP-loop‚Äù motif idiosyncratic to a family of enzymes that catalyze the adenylation of a carbonyl oxygen for subsequent nucleophilic substitution (19.Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The ‚ÄúP-loop‚Äù motif was found by querying the genomic data base with the sequence of ThiI using the PSI-BLAST algorithm (20.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J.H. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59167) Google Scholar). Further scrutiny of sequence data revealed a motif shared with rhodanese, an enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide, generating sulfite and thiocyanate. Rhodanese catalyzes sulfur transfer through the formation of a persulfide on an active site cysteine residue (21.Westley J. Van Temelen E.E. Bioorganic Chemistry. 1. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1977: 371-390Google Scholar), and this cysteine lies in the motif identified in ThiI (Fig. 1). We now report that the cysteine residue, Cys-456, in this rhodanese sulfurtransferase motif is critical for ThiI function both in vivo and in vitro.DISCUSSIONThe two groups that took part in this work independently discerned a stretch of sequence similarity between E. coli ThiI and the carboxyl-terminal domain of rhodanese, which contains the active site. Rhodanese catalyzes sulfur transfer through the formation of a persulfide on an active site cysteine residue (21.Westley J. Van Temelen E.E. Bioorganic Chemistry. 1. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1977: 371-390Google Scholar), which aligns with Cys-456 in ThiI (Fig. 1). This ‚Äúrhodanese motif‚Äù lies in a ‚àº100-amino acid C-terminal extension of ThiI found only in the enzymes of E. coli and closely related organisms. The COG data base, which compares proteins encoded by the 21 organisms whose entire genome sequence are currently known (26.Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar), contains 11 ThiI orthologs. Of these, only ThiI proteins from E. coli andH. influenzae possess the sequence of limited similarity to rhodanese.As a first test of the functional significance of this sequence alignment, the ability of ThiI to catalyze rhodanese-like sulfur transfer was assayed. Thiosulfate could be utilized as the sulfur donor with cyanide as the acceptor, and ThiI was shown to catalyze the reaction (Fig. 3). Next, the cysteine residue implicated by the sequence alignment was changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis to generate C456A ThiI, and the altered enzyme was examined bothin vivo and in vitro.E. coli strain VJS2890(DE3) is a thiI mutant and so does not generate s4U in tRNA. This strain, therefore, continues to grow when exposed to near-UV light (it lacks the photosensor). The near-UV resistant phenotype of this strain is complemented by a plasmid bearing the wild-type thiI gene. The thiI +-complemented cells produce s4U in tRNA and enter growth arrest when exposed to near-UV light. Transformation of VJS2890(DE3) with a plasmid encoding C456A ThiI does not effect complementation, indicating thatthe mutant enzyme is inactive in vivo. This conclusion was confirmed by the lack of detectable s4U in tRNA from VJS2890(DE3) harboring the plasmid for expression of C456A ThiI (Fig.2).Data from in vitro assays also demonstrate the inactivation of the enzyme by elimination of the putative active site thiol group. First, C456A ThiI is an impaired catalyst for the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide (Fig. 3). It seems likely that the residual catalysis can be ascribed to the presence of one (or all) of the other cysteine residues in C456A ThiI. In this case, Cys-456 is roughly 6.5-fold more effective in forming a persulfide than are the other four cysteine residues combined. Second, the addition of purified C456AThiI to VJS2890(DE3) cell extracts does not enable the in vitrogeneration of s4U, while addition of wild-type ThiI to the same assay system leads to s4U production (Fig. 3). Third, the overexpression, storage behavior, and CD spectrum of C456A ThiI are essentially identical to wild-type ThiI (data not shown), indicating that the altered enzyme retains a wild-type fold and eliminating the possibility that a gross structural change inactivates C456A ThiI.Based on our findings, we propose that catalysis by ThiI proceedsvia a persulfide intermediate at Cys-456 during catalysis. This proposal fits nicely with the recent identification of the NifS-like protein IscS as an enzyme capable of mobilizing sulfur from cysteine for the in vitro generation of s4U (27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NifS and IscS, like rhodanese, are sulfurtransferases that undergo formation of a persulfide on an active-site cysteine, in this case generated by transfer of the sulfur from free cysteine to the enzymic cysteine thiol group (28.Zheng L.M. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 29.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The terminal sulfur in the persulfide of IscS could then be transferred to ThiI in a ‚Äútranspersulfidation‚Äù reaction. This hypothesis is consistent with the proposal by Kambampati and Lauhon (27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that IscS transfers a sulfur originating on cysteine to ThiI, which we further develop by proposing that S0 (formally) is transferred to ThiI.The direct transfer of sulfur from ThiI to tRNA remains to be established definitively, but the use of a persulfide as a sulfur donor is chemically reasonable. While most discussion of enzymic persulfide moieties has focused on the transfer of the terminal sulfur atom as S0, each sulfur in a persulfide is formally S1‚àí and so can undergo chemistry either as formal S0 or S2‚àí centers. In other words, the electrons from the S‚ÄìS bond can flow toward either sulfur during reaction. Based on the generation of hydrogen sulfide and an enzymic disulfide from a thioredoxin persulfide formed by transfer of S0 from rhodanese (30.Nandi D.L. Westley J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the additional C-terminal amino acid residues in ThiI from E. coli and closely related organisms might be a sulfide-generating domain, analogous to ammonia-generating domains in enzymes such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (31.Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and GMP synthetase (32.Tesmer J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The generated sulfide would then nucleophilically attack C4 of uridine to make s4U. The sulfur could even reside transiently in an iron-sulfur cluster, an intriguing possibility raised by recent findings regarding biotin (4.Bui B.T.S. Florentin D. Fournier F. Ploux O. Mejean A. Marquet A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,5.Gibson K.J. Pelletier D.A. Turner I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and lipoic acid (6.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) biosynthesis; however, there is currently no evidence of an iron-sulfur cluster in overexpressed ThiI.The exchange of oxygen in uridine for sulfur almost certainly will proceed via nucleophilic attack of anionic sulfur at C4 of uridine. Since the terminal sulfur has nucleophilic character, it is chemically reasonable for the persulfide of Cys-456 to participate directly in the substitution reaction. The nucleophilicity of the persulfide group is the crux of a general reaction scheme that is, to our knowledge, a novel proposal of chemistry by an enzymic persulfide (Fig.4). The activation of O4 of uridine as a leaving group is quite likely, and the requirement of ATP for the generation of s4U supports activation of O4 by adenylation. 2While the presence of an essential P-loop motif that is shared with other adenylating enzymes makes ThiI an obvious candidate for the enzyme that adenylates O4 (19.Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we have been unable to detect any reaction between ATP and tRNA catalyzed by ThiI alone. Attack by the terminal sulfur of the persulfide generates a tetrahedral intermediate, which collapses by the expulsion of AMP and forms an enzyme-uridine disulfide species. The sulfur-sulfur bond is reductively cleaved by familiar disulfide chemistry, perhaps by attack of a thiol(ate) group on SŒ≥ to form s4U and a different disulfide on Lys-456. The attacking thiol(ate) could be from another cysteine residue on ThiI 3E. coli, S. typhimurium, and H. influenzae ThiI have four other cysteine residues in identical positions, though Cys-456 is the sole cysteine residue in the C-terminal extension unique to ThiI from these three closely related organisms. or from an exogenous thiol. The resulting enzymic disulfide bond would then be reduced: in vivo, perhaps, by a coupled protein system such as those involving thioredoxin or glutaredoxin; and in vitroby DTT (or Œ≤-mercaptoethanol), which is required for activity. The regenerated active site cysteine thiol(ate) is then converted to the persulfide by transfer of sulfur from IscS, restarting the catalytic cycle.Figure 4A mechanism for transfer of sulfur from a persulfide on ThiI to uridine-8 of tRNA. The events occur at the ThiI active site containing Cys-456, which aligns with the active site cysteine residue of rhodanese. The persulfide of Cys-456 attacks C4 of uridine-8 in tRNA, which may be activated by adenylation. Reductive cleavage of the S‚ÄìS bond between Cys-456 and the incipient s4U then occurs, perhaps by attack of a thiol group (either exogenous or from another cysteine residue of ThiI) to form a disulfide bond and generate s4U as shown. DTT could serve this rolein vitro. The pictured enzymic disulfide bond is reduced, perhaps by a thioredoxin- or glutaredoxin-type system in vivo (in vitro reduction by DTT is shown). The formation of the Cys-456 persulfide for the next reaction cycle is effected by sulfur transfer from a persulfide on a cysteine residue in IscS, as postulated by Kambampati and Lauhon (27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).

Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have generated s4U with no proteins other than purified recombinant IscS and ThiI, we stress that no direct reaction between uridine in tRNA and ThiI has been demonstrated definitively. The general scheme we present in our mechanism (Fig. 4) can transfer the terminal sulfur in a persulfide as S2‚àí whether in s4U itself or in a metabolic intermediate. For example, Begley and co-workers (33.Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. Kinsland C. Chiu H.J. Costello C.K. Backstrom A.D. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have elegantly demonstrated that the thiocarboxylate of the small protein ThiS lies along the thiamin biosynthetic pathway, and our general scheme can accommodate generation of such a species if the persulfide attacks an activated carboxylate group rather than an activated uridine residue. Similarly, a thiophosphate species might also be generated by such chemistry (either thiophosphate itself or the thiophosphate analog of AMP) using ATP as a substrate. Stadtman and co-workers (34.Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30921-30926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have demonstrated an analogous system for selenophosphate formation: NifS and selenocysteine substitute effectively for selenide in the generation of selenophosphate, the selenium donor for the biosynthesis of 2-selenouridine residues in tRNA.While distinction of these various possibilities awaits further experimentation, we have shown that Cys-456 of ThiI is catalytically essential. Our proposal that ThiI bears a persulfide on Cys-456 during its catalytic cycle respresents, at the very least, a novel twist in the fascinating biosynthetic pathways leading to s4U and thiamin. The confirmation of the proposed persulfide on ThiI and the elucidation of its chemistry may have broader impact on the understanding of sulfur metabolism by revealing a new mode of sulfur transfer based on the nucleophilicity of persulfides. Many aspects of sulfur metabolism remain unelucidated, including details of the incorporation of sulfur into iron-sulfur clusters (1.Zheng L.M. Cash V.L. Flint D.H. Dean D.R. J. Biol.

We now report that the cysteine residue, Cys-456, in this rhodanese sulfurtransferase motif is critical for ThiI function both in vivo and in vitro. DISCUSSIONThe two groups that took part in this work independently discerned a stretch of sequence similarity between E. coli ThiI and the carboxyl-terminal domain of rhodanese, which contains the active site.

This ‚Äúrhodanese motif‚Äù lies in a ‚àº100-amino acid C-terminal extension of ThiI found only in the enzymes of E. coli and closely related organisms. The COG data base, which compares proteins encoded by the 21 organisms whose entire genome sequence are currently known (26.Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar), contains 11 ThiI orthologs. Of these, only ThiI proteins from E. coli andH. influenzae possess the sequence of limited similarity to rhodanese.As a first test of the functional significance of this sequence alignment, the ability of ThiI to catalyze rhodanese-like sulfur transfer was assayed. Thiosulfate could be utilized as the sulfur donor with cyanide as the acceptor, and ThiI was shown to catalyze the reaction (Fig. 3). Next, the cysteine residue implicated by the sequence alignment was changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis to generate C456A ThiI, and the altered enzyme was examined bothin vivo and in vitro.E. coli strain VJS2890(DE3) is a thiI mutant and so does not generate s4U in tRNA. This strain, therefore, continues to grow when exposed to near-UV light (it lacks the photosensor). The near-UV resistant phenotype of this strain is complemented by a plasmid bearing the wild-type thiI gene. The thiI +-complemented cells produce s4U in tRNA and enter growth arrest when exposed to near-UV light. Transformation of VJS2890(DE3) with a plasmid encoding C456A ThiI does not effect complementation, indicating thatthe mutant enzyme is inactive in vivo. This conclusion was confirmed by the lack of detectable s4U in tRNA from VJS2890(DE3) harboring the plasmid for expression of C456A ThiI (Fig.2).Data from in vitro assays also demonstrate the inactivation of the enzyme by elimination of the putative active site thiol group. First, C456A ThiI is an impaired catalyst for the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide (Fig. 3). It seems likely that the residual catalysis can be ascribed to the presence of one (or all) of the other cysteine residues in C456A ThiI. In this case, Cys-456 is roughly 6.5-fold more effective in forming a persulfide than are the other four cysteine residues combined. Second, the addition of purified C456AThiI to VJS2890(DE3) cell extracts does not enable the in vitrogeneration of s4U, while addition of wild-type ThiI to the same assay system leads to s4U production (Fig. 3).

This proposal fits nicely with the recent identification of the NifS-like protein IscS as an enzyme capable of mobilizing sulfur from cysteine for the in vitro generation of s4U (27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NifS and IscS, like rhodanese, are sulfurtransferases that undergo formation of a persulfide on an active-site cysteine, in this case generated by transfer of the sulfur from free cysteine to the enzymic cysteine thiol group (28.Zheng L.M. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 29.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The terminal sulfur in the persulfide of IscS could then be transferred to ThiI in a ‚Äútranspersulfidation‚Äù reaction. This hypothesis is consistent with the proposal by Kambampati and Lauhon (27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that IscS transfers a sulfur originating on cysteine to ThiI, which we further develop by proposing that S0 (formally) is transferred to ThiI.The direct transfer of sulfur from ThiI to tRNA remains to be established definitively, but the use of a persulfide as a sulfur donor is chemically reasonable. While most discussion of enzymic persulfide moieties has focused on the transfer of the terminal sulfur atom as S0, each sulfur in a persulfide is formally S1‚àí and so can undergo chemistry either as formal S0 or S2‚àí centers. In other words, the electrons from the S‚ÄìS bond can flow toward either sulfur during reaction. Based on the generation of hydrogen sulfide and an enzymic disulfide from a thioredoxin persulfide formed by transfer of S0 from rhodanese (30.Nandi D.L. Westley J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the additional C-terminal amino acid residues in ThiI from E. coli and closely related organisms might be a sulfide-generating domain, analogous to ammonia-generating domains in enzymes such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (31.Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and GMP synthetase (32.Tesmer J.G. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The generated sulfide would then nucleophilically attack C4 of uridine to make s4U. The sulfur could even reside transiently in an iron-sulfur cluster, an intriguing possibility raised by recent findings regarding biotin (4.Bui B.T.S. Florentin D. Fournier F. Ploux O. Mejean A. Marquet A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,5.Gibson K.J. Pelletier D.A. Turner I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and lipoic acid (6.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) biosynthesis; however, there is currently no evidence of an iron-sulfur cluster in overexpressed ThiI.The exchange of oxygen in uridine for sulfur almost certainly will proceed via nucleophilic attack of anionic sulfur at C4 of uridine. Since the terminal sulfur has nucleophilic character, it is chemically reasonable for the persulfide of Cys-456 to participate directly in the substitution reaction. The nucleophilicity of the persulfide group is the crux of a general reaction scheme that is, to our knowledge, a novel proposal of chemistry by an enzymic persulfide (Fig.4). The activation of O4 of uridine as a leaving group is quite likely, and the requirement of ATP for the generation of s4U supports activation of O4 by adenylation. 2While the presence of an essential P-loop motif that is shared with other adenylating enzymes makes ThiI an obvious candidate for the enzyme that adenylates O4 (19.Mueller E.G. Palenchar P.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2424-2427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), we have been unable to detect any reaction between ATP and tRNA catalyzed by ThiI alone. Attack by the terminal sulfur of the persulfide generates a tetrahedral intermediate, which collapses by the expulsion of AMP and forms an enzyme-uridine disulfide species. The sulfur-sulfur bond is reductively cleaved by familiar disulfide chemistry, perhaps by attack of a thiol(ate) group on SŒ≥ to form s4U and a different disulfide on Lys-456. The attacking thiol(ate) could be from another cysteine residue on ThiI 3E. coli, S. typhimurium, and H. influenzae ThiI have four other cysteine residues in identical positions, though Cys-456 is the sole cysteine residue in the C-terminal extension unique to ThiI from these three closely related organisms. or from an exogenous thiol. The resulting enzymic disulfide bond would then be reduced: in vivo, perhaps, by a coupled protein system such as those involving thioredoxin or glutaredoxin; and in vitroby DTT (or Œ≤-mercaptoethanol), which is required for activity. The regenerated active site cysteine thiol(ate) is then converted to the persulfide by transfer of sulfur from IscS, restarting the catalytic cycle.Although Kambampati and Lauhon (27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have generated s4U with no proteins other than purified recombinant IscS and ThiI, we stress that no direct reaction between uridine in tRNA and ThiI has been demonstrated definitively. The general scheme we present in our mechanism (Fig. 4) can transfer the terminal sulfur in a persulfide as S2‚àí whether in s4U itself or in a metabolic intermediate. For example, Begley and co-workers (33.Taylor S.V. Kelleher N.L. Kinsland C. Chiu H.J. Costello C.K. Backstrom A.D. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) have elegantly demonstrated that the thiocarboxylate of the small protein ThiS lies along the thiamin biosynthetic pathway, and our general scheme can accommodate generation of such a species if the persulfide attacks an activated carboxylate group rather than an activated uridine residue. Similarly, a thiophosphate species might also be generated by such chemistry (either thiophosphate itself or the thiophosphate analog of AMP) using ATP as a substrate. Stadtman and co-workers (34.Lacourciere G.M. Stadtman T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30921-30926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have demonstrated an analogous system for selenophosphate formation: NifS and selenocysteine substitute effectively for selenide in the generation of selenophosphate, the selenium donor for the biosynthesis of 2-selenouridine residues in tRNA.While distinction of these various possibilities awaits further experimentation, we have shown that Cys-456 of ThiI is catalytically essential. Our proposal that ThiI bears a persulfide on Cys-456 during its catalytic cycle respresents, at the very least, a novel twist in the fascinating biosynthetic pathways leading to s4U and thiamin. The confirmation of the proposed persulfide on ThiI and the elucidation of its chemistry may have broader impact on the understanding of sulfur metabolism by revealing a new mode of sulfur transfer based on the nucleophilicity of persulfides. The two groups that took part in this work independently discerned a stretch of sequence similarity between E. coli ThiI and the carboxyl-terminal domain of rhodanese, which contains the active site. Rhodanese catalyzes sulfur transfer through the formation of a persulfide on an active site cysteine residue (21.Westley J. Van Temelen E.E. Bioorganic Chemistry. 1. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1977: 371-390Google Scholar), which aligns with Cys-456 in ThiI (Fig. 1). This ‚Äúrhodanese motif‚Äù lies in a ‚àº100-amino acid C-terminal extension of ThiI found only in the enzymes of E. coli and closely related organisms. The COG data base, which compares proteins encoded by the 21 organisms whose entire genome sequence are currently known (26.Tatusov R.L. Koonin E.V. Lipman D.J. Science. 1997; 278: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (2732) Google Scholar), contains 11 ThiI orthologs. Of these, only ThiI proteins from E. coli andH. influenzae possess the sequence of limited similarity to rhodanese. As a first test of the functional significance of this sequence alignment, the ability of ThiI to catalyze rhodanese-like sulfur transfer was assayed. Thiosulfate could be utilized as the sulfur donor with cyanide as the acceptor, and ThiI was shown to catalyze the reaction (Fig. 3). Next, the cysteine residue implicated by the sequence alignment was changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis to generate C456A ThiI, and the altered enzyme was examined bothin vivo and in vitro. E. coli strain VJS2890(DE3) is a thiI mutant and so does not generate s4U in tRNA. This strain, therefore, continues to grow when exposed to near-UV light (it lacks the photosensor). The near-UV resistant phenotype of this strain is complemented by a plasmid bearing the wild-type thiI gene. The thiI +-complemented cells produce s4U in tRNA and enter growth arrest when exposed to near-UV light. Transformation of VJS2890(DE3) with a plasmid encoding C456A ThiI does not effect complementation, indicating thatthe mutant enzyme is inactive in vivo. This conclusion was confirmed by the lack of detectable s4U in tRNA from VJS2890(DE3) harboring the plasmid for expression of C456A ThiI (Fig.2). Data from in vitro assays also demonstrate the inactivation of the enzyme by elimination of the putative active site thiol group. First, C456A ThiI is an impaired catalyst for the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide (Fig. 3). It seems likely that the residual catalysis can be ascribed to the presence of one (or all) of the other cysteine residues in C456A ThiI. In this case, Cys-456 is roughly 6.5-fold more effective in forming a persulfide than are the other four cysteine residues combined. Second, the addition of purified C456AThiI to VJS2890(DE3) cell extracts does not enable the in vitrogeneration of s4U, while addition of wild-type ThiI to the same assay system leads to s4U production (Fig. 3). Third, the overexpression, storage behavior, and CD spectrum of C456A ThiI are essentially identical to wild-type ThiI (data not shown), indicating that the altered enzyme retains a wild-type fold and eliminating the possibility that a gross structural change inactivates C456A ThiI. Based on our findings, we propose that catalysis by ThiI proceedsvia a persulfide intermediate at Cys-456 during catalysis. This proposal fits nicely with the recent identification of the NifS-like protein IscS as an enzyme capable of mobilizing sulfur from cysteine for the in vitro generation of s4U (27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NifS and IscS, like rhodanese, are sulfurtransferases that undergo formation of a persulfide on an active-site cysteine, in this case generated by transfer of the sulfur from free cysteine to the enzymic cysteine thiol group (28.Zheng L.M. White R.H. Cash V.L. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4714-4720Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 29.Flint D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16068-16074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The terminal sulfur in the persulfide of IscS could then be transferred to ThiI in a ‚Äútranspersulfidation‚Äù reaction. This hypothesis is consistent with the proposal by Kambampati and Lauhon (27.Kambampati R. Lauhon C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16561-16568Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) that IscS transfers a sulfur originating on cysteine to ThiI, which we further develop by proposing that S0 (formally) is transferred to ThiI. The direct transfer of sulfur from ThiI to tRNA remains to be established definitively, but the use of a persulfide as a sulfur donor is chemically reasonable. While most discussion of enzymic persulfide moieties has focused on the transfer of the terminal sulfur atom as S0, each sulfur in a persulfide is formally S1‚àí and so can undergo chemistry either as formal S0 or S2‚àí centers. In other words, the electrons from the S‚ÄìS bond can flow toward either sulfur during reaction. Based on the generation of hydrogen sulfide and an enzymic disulfide from a thioredoxin persulfide formed by transfer of S0 from rhodanese (30.Nandi D.L. Westley J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 30: 973-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the additional C-terminal amino acid residues in ThiI from E. coli and closely related organisms might be a sulfide-generating domain, analogous to ammonia-generating domains in enzymes such as carbamoyl phosphate synthetase (31.Thoden J.B.

Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar). The activation of the RTKs results in autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues within their cytoplasmic tails. This creates specific binding sites for intracellular signal transduction molecules such as Shc, Grb2, and PI3-K that interact with phosphotyrosines via their Src homology 2 or phosphotyrosine-binding domains. These interactions result in activation of downstream signal transduction pathways by subsequent phosphorylation events, conformational changes, and/or translocation of the downstream signaling molecules (2.Kavanaugh W.M.

Thus, the nature of the cellular responses elicited by a growth factor is a result of the specific interactions of intracellular signaling molecules with the RTKs.

Casagranda F. Orioli D. Simon H. Lai C. Klein R. Lemke G. Nature. 1995; 378: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). ErbB4 is also expressed by some epithelia and may participate in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, for example during the differentiation of the mammary gland at pregnancy (28.Yang Y. Spitzer E. Meyer D. Sachs M. Niemann C. Hartmann G. Weidner K.M. Birchmeier C. Birchmeier W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 215-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that ErbB4 has oncogenic activities in human tumors. For example, ErbB4 is expressed by several tumor cell lines (8.Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar), and overexpression of ErbB4 together with ErbB2 is associated with poor prognosis in childhood medulloblastoma (29.Gilbertson R.J. Perry R.H. Kelly P.J. Pearson A.D. Lunec J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3272-3280PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular signaling mechanisms by which ErbB4 stimulates these activities are largely unknown. Recently, it was demonstrated that two pairs of naturally occurring ErbB4 isoforms exist in human and mouse tissues (30.Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J.

These isoform pairs are differentially expressed in tissues such as heart and brain, suggesting that they may have specific functions (30.Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 31.Elenius K. Choi C.J. Paul S. Santiestevan E. Nishi E. Klagsbrun M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). One pair of ErbB4 isoforms differs within the extracellular juxtamembrane domain (isoforms JM-a and JM-b) and in susceptibility to being cleaved in response to phorbol ester treatment (30.Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The other pair of ErbB4 isoforms differs in the cytoplasmic tail domain by the presence (CYT-1) or absence (CYT-2) of a 16-amino acid sequence including a Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-Met consensus-binding site for PI3-K (31.Elenius K. Choi C.J. Paul S. Santiestevan E. Nishi E. Klagsbrun M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 32.Sawyer C. Hiles I. Page M. Crompton M. Dean C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). When overexpressed in an NIH 3T3 cell line, the isoforms are functionally different in that ErbB4 CYT-1 but not ErbB4 CYT-2 is capable of binding and activating PI3-K (31.Elenius K. Choi C.J. Paul S. Santiestevan E. Nishi E. Klagsbrun M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The schematic structure of the ErbB4 isoforms, the sources of their identification, and the alternative nomenclature introduced by Sawyer and co-workers (32.Sawyer C. Hiles I. Page M. Crompton M. Dean C. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 919-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) are shown in Fig.1. PI3-Ks are lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3‚Ä≤ position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides at the plasma membranes (33.Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). As a consequence, membrane-binding sites for downstream signaling molecules such as the serine-threonine kinase Akt are generated (34.Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). The PI3-Ks have been divided into separate classes based on their structure and substrate specificity (35.Domin J. Waterfield M.D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). RTKs activate class IA PI3-Ks that are heterodimeric proteins consisting of a regulatory subunit, either p85, p55, or p50, and a catalytic subunit, p110. The Src homology 2 domains of the regulatory subunits mediate the association of the catalytic subunits with RTKs by binding to phosphotyrosines flanked by specific amino acids (36.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2381) Google Scholar). Studies using several different approaches have implicated that RTK-activated PI3-Ks participate in the signal transduction pathways leading to numerous different cellular responses (reviewed in Ref. 37.Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8347-8350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). For example, inhibiting PI3-K activation by chemical inhibitors or by mutating the receptor-binding site for PI3-K interferes with growth factor-stimulated survival (38.Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar), membrane ruffling and chemotaxis (39.WennstroÃàm S. Hawkins P. Cooke F. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T.

Interestingly, B-lymphocytes isolated from null mice with targeted p85Œ± gene have either an attenuated survival or mitogenic response, depending on the survival/growth factor tested (46.Fruman D.A.

In this report, we have analyzed the biological consequences of the inability of a naturally occurring RTK isoform, ErbB4 CYT-2, to activate PI3-K. When ErbB4 CYT-2 was expressed in an NIH 3T3 cell line, cell proliferation in response to NRG-1Œ≤ was comparable with cells expressing ErbB4 CYT-1, consistent with the unimpaired ability of the CYT-2 cells to activate the Shc/MAPK pathway. However, the ability of NRG-1Œ≤ to induce survival and chemotaxis in CYT-2 cells was markedly reduced. The lack of survival was consistent with the inability of CYT-2 cells to activate the PI3-K/Akt pathway. The results demonstrate that the signaling pathways leading to proliferation can be dissociated from those leading to survival and chemotaxis and support a central role for PI3-K in both survival and chemotactic signaling. Clone 7 NIH 3T3 cells expressing ErbB4 CYT-1 or ErbB4 CYT-2 were prepared by cotransfection of a plasmid encoding a neomycin resistance gene together with a plasmid encoding an ErbB4 isoform as described previously (31.Elenius K. Choi C.J. Paul S. Santiestevan E. Nishi E. Klagsbrun M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Several independently produced clones expressing either CYT isoform were prepared. The wild type (parental) clone 7 NIH 3T3 cells, NIH 3T3 cells expressing ErbB1, as well as one NIH 3T3 clone expressing ErbB4 CYT-1 designated ErbB4 CYT-1 number 1 (previously CYT-1 amg) were kindly provided by Dr. K. Zhang (Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA) (47.Zhang K. Sun J. Liu N. Wen D. Chang D. Thomason A. Yoshinaga S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3884-3890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The wild type parental cells and a clone generated by transfecting the NIH 3T3 cells with the neomycin resistance gene encoding plasmid alone (designated Neo) served as negative controls. The cells were maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin supplement (Irvine Scientific), and 4.5 g/liter glucose. The culture media of transfected clones were supplemented with 500 Œºg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Calbiochem). Cells were grown to confluence on 100-mm dishes and lysed into a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Œºg/ml aprotinin, and 10 Œºg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were centrifuged, and 75-Œºg samples of total protein from the supernatants were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE gels. The separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific binding to the filters was blocked by a 1-h incubation in a buffer containing TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween-20), 5% nonfat dry milk, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma). The ErbB4 protein was subsequently detected by successive 1-h incubations with a polyclonal anti-ErbB4 antibody (sc-283; Santa Cruz; 1:100 dilution) and a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; 1:10,000 dilution), both in TBS-T, 5% milk, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Bound secondary antibody was visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography. Recombinant human NRG-1Œ≤ (R & D; residues 176‚Äì246 of human heregulin-Œ≤1) was iodinated using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) as described previously (20.Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun J. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Na125I (NEN Life Science Products) was used at 100 ŒºCi/Œºg of protein, and a specific activity of 120,000 CPM/ng was achieved. For cross-linking experiments, cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown to confluence. The cells were incubated in the presence of 25 ng/ml 125I-NRG-1Œ≤, and the bound125I-NRG-1Œ≤ was immobilized to cell surface receptors by cross-linking with 200 Œºm disuccinimidyl suberate (Pierce) as described (20.Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun J. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Cross-linked complexes were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by autoradiography. To determine the effect of NRG-1Œ≤ on the proliferation of cells in the presence of 1% serum, cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The following day the media were replaced by DMEM, 1% FBS with or without 20 ng/ml NRG-1Œ≤. Cell number was subsequently calculated at 2, 5, and 7 days after the initiation of the culture. This was carried out by trypsinizing the cells and measuring their numbers with an automatic cell counter (Coulter Counter; Coulter Electronics). To assess the effect of NRG-1Œ≤ on cell number after starvation in the absence of serum (survival assay), cells were plated at a density of 50,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The following day the media were replaced by DMEM containing no serum and 0, 1, 10, or 100 ng/ml NRG-1Œ≤. After a further 3-day culture in the presence or absence of growth factor, the cell numbers were quantitated using a Coulter Counter as above. To analyze phosphorylation of signal transduction proteins, cells were grown to confluence and starved overnight in serum-free DMEM. The cells were stimulated with or without 50‚Äì100 ng/ml NRG-1Œ≤ for 10 min on ice followed by 5 min at 37 ¬∞C, with the exception of the time course analysis of Erk activation, for which cells were stimulated at 37 ¬∞C as indicated. The growth factor treatments were initiated on ice and then continued at 37 ¬∞C to better synchronize conditions between cells on separate dishes. The results were similar when cell were stimulated for 5 or 10 min at 37 ¬∞C without a preceding incubation on ice (data not shown). After stimulations, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Œºg/ml aprotinin, 10 Œºg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. To detect tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, aliquots of the lysates corresponding to 500 Œºg of total protein were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal anti-Shc antibody (H-108; Santa Cruz; 2 Œºl/500 Œºl). The immunoprecipitated samples were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The tyrosine phosphorylation of the precipitated Shc proteins was subsequently analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; 2 Œºg/ml), a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Cappel; 1:50,000 dilution), and ECL. To detect association of p85 with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, aliquots of the lysates corresponding to 500 Œºg of total protein were immunoprecipitated with the 4G10 monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (10 Œºg/500 Œºl). The immunoprecipitated samples were separated in 8% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The presence of p85 among the precipitated tyrosine phosphorylated proteins was subsequently analyzed by Western blotting with a monoclonal anti-p85 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; 1:100 dilution), the peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Cappel; 1:20,000 dilution), and ECL. The phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 at Thr202 and at Tyr204 and the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473were analyzed by direct Western blotting with phosphospecific polyclonal antibodies, anti-phospho-MAPK, and anti-phospho-Akt, respectively (both from New England Biolabs; 1:1000 dilution). For these experiments, aliquots corresponding to 50‚Äì75 Œºg of total protein were separated in 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The phospho-specific antibodies bound to antigens on the nitrocellulose filters were detected by an incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories; 1:10,000 dilution) and ECL. Akt protein levels were determined by subsequent incubations of the filter with polyclonal anti-Akt antibody (Upstate Biotechnology; 1:500 dilution) and peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody (Chemicon; 1:10 000 dilution) followed by ECL. To determine the effect of NRG-1Œ≤ on the survival of serum-starved cells, nuclear morphology was analyzed by staining with DAPI (Sigma) as a method to identify apoptotic cells. Two different experimental designs were used to analyze the survival effect of NRG-1Œ≤ in serum-starved low and high density cultures. For low cell density experiments, cells were plated at 100,000 cells/35-mm dish in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The following day the media were replaced by DMEM containing 0.5% FBS. After a 48-h incubation in the low serum medium, the media were replaced by serum-free DMEM with or without 40 ng/ml NRG-1Œ≤ and cultured for another 48 h. For high cell density experiments, cells were plated at 400,000 cells/35-mm dish in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The following day, the cells were washed once with DMEM and then incubated for 72 h in serum-free DMEM with or without 40 ng/ml NRG-1Œ≤. To deprive the cells from endogenously produced soluble survival factors, the cells were washed with DMEM, and the media were replaced by fresh DMEM with or without NRG-1Œ≤ once every 24 h during the 72-h starvation/growth factor treatment period. After the incubations in the presence or absence of NRG-1Œ≤, cells from both high and low density experiments were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, washed once with PBS, and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min at room temperature. After another wash with PBS, the cells were incubated with 0.5 Œºg/ml DAPI in PBS for 60 min at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, coverslips were mounted on top of the stained cells using Aquamount (BDH), and the cells were viewed in microscope under UV light and photographed. The effects of NRG-1Œ≤ and FBS on cell migration were measured by modified Boyden chamber assays as described previously (48.Boyden S. J. Exp. Med. 1962; 115: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (2026) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells starved overnight in serum-free DMEM were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and suspended in DMEM to a final concentration of 500,000 cells/ml. 50 Œºl of the cell suspension was applied to wells in the upper chambers. Chemoattractants NRG-1Œ≤ and FBS were diluted to various concentration in DMEM and applied to the wells in the lower chambers. A micropore filter (pore size, 8 Œºm; Poretics Products Inc.) coated with 6.7 Œºg/ml human fibronectin (Becton-Dickinson) in PBS was placed between the cells and the chemoattractants. After a 4-h incubation of the chambers at 37 ¬∞C, the cells migrated through the filter were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS, stained with Harris hematoxylin (Sigma), and mounted with Permount (Fisher). All experiments were performed in quadruplicate for each concentration of the chemoattractant. Membrane ruffles were visualized by staining actin filaments with TRITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). Cells were cultured on glass coverslips in 24-well plates in DMEM, 10% FBS. Subconfluent cells were starved for 60 min in serum-free DMEM and subsequently stimulated for 15 min with DMEM containing 0 or 20 ng/ml NRG-1Œ≤. After stimulation, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, washed once with PBS, and permeabilized with 100% acetone for 5 min at ‚àí20 ¬∞C. The coverslips were washed three times with PBS, and the actin filaments were stained with 100 ng/ml of TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma) in PBS for 45 min at room temperature in a humidified atmosphere. After rinsing with PBS and distilled water, the coverslips were mounted with Aquamount, viewed in a microscope under UV light, and photographed. NIH 3T3 clone 7 cells stably transfected with plasmids encoding ErbB4 CYT-1 or ErbB4 CYT-2 (31.Elenius K. Choi C.J. Paul S. Santiestevan E. Nishi E. Klagsbrun M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2607-2616Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) were used to analyze the functional differences between the ErbB4 cytoplasmic isoforms. To this end the ErbB4 expression levels of the transfectants were determined to select independent clones that express different amounts of ErbB4. Wild type cells, control cells transfected with a plasmid encoding a neomycin resistance gene (designated Neo), and three independent clones each expressing either ErbB4 CYT-1 or ErbB4 CYT-2 were analyzed for ErbB4 protein lev"
https://openalex.org/W1537754319,"The common sialic acids of mammalian cells are N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). Humans are an exception, because of a mutation in CMP-sialic acid hydroxylase, which occurred after our common ancestor with great apes. We asked if the resulting loss of Neu5Gc and increase in Neu5Ac in humans alters the biology of the siglecs, which are Ig superfamily members that recognize sialic acids. Human siglec-1 (sialoadhesin) strongly prefers Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc. Thus, humans have a higher density of siglec-1 ligands than great apes. Siglec-1-positive macrophages in humans are found primarily in the perifollicular zone, whereas in chimpanzees they also occur in the marginal zone and surrounding the periarteriolar lymphocyte sheaths. Although only a subset of chimpanzee macrophages express siglec-1, most human macrophages are positive. A known evolutionary difference is the strong preference of mouse siglec-2 (CD22) for Neu5Gc, contrasting with human siglec-2, which binds Neu5Ac equally well. To ask when the preference for Neu5Gc was adjusted in the human lineage, we cloned the first three extracellular domains of siglec-2 from all of the great apes and examined their preference. In fact, siglec-2 had evolved a higher degree of recognition flexibility before Neu5Gc was lost in humans. Human siglec-3 (CD33) and siglec-6 (obesity-binding protein 1) also recognize both Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc, and siglec-5 may have some preference for Neu5Gc. Others showed that siglec-4a (myelin-associated glycoprotein) prefers Neu5Ac over Neu5Gc. Thus, the human loss of Neu5Gc may alter biological processes involving siglec-1, and possibly, siglec-4a or -5."

We investigated the mechanism for proton transport of the M2protein in Xenopus oocytes using a two-electrode voltage clamp and in CV-1 cells using the whole cell patch clamp technique. Membrane currents were recorded while manipulating the external solution to alter either the total or free proton concentration or the solvent itself. Membrane conductance decreased by ‚àº50% when D2O replaced H2O as the solvent. From this, we conclude that hydrogen ions do not pass through M2 as hydronium ions, but instead must interact with titratable groups that line the pore of the channel. M2 currents measured in solutions of low buffer concentration (<15 mm in oocytes and <0.15 mm in CV-1 cells) were smaller than those studied in solutions of high buffer concentration. Furthermore, the reversal voltage measured in low buffer was shifted to a more negative voltage than in high buffer. Also, at a given pH, M2current amplitude in 15 mm buffer decreased when pH-pK a was increased by changing the buffer pK a.

In addition, in influenza virus-infected cells, the M2 protein causes the equilibration of pH between the acidic lumen of thetrans-Golgi network and the cytoplasm (1.Hay A.J. Semin. Virol. 1992; 3: 21-30Google Scholar, 2.Lamb R.A. Holsinger L.J. Pinto L.H. Wimmer E. Receptor-mediated Virus Entry into Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 303-321Google Scholar). The M2 protein consists of a 24-residue N-terminal extracellular domain, a single internal hydrophobic domain of 19 residues that acts as a transmembrane domain and forms the pore of the channel, and a 54-residue cytoplasmic tail (3.Lamb R.A. Zebedee S.L. Richardson C.D. Cell. 1985; 40: 627-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking studies showed the M2 protein to exist minimally as a homotetramer (4.Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A.

Despite the small size of the active M2 oligomer, several pieces of evidence indicate that ion channel activity is intrinsic to the M2 protein.

Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2204-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Second, M2 channel activity has also been recorded in artificial lipid bilayers from a reconstituted peptide corresponding to the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein (14.Duff K.C. Ashley R.H. Virology. 1992; 190: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and from purified M2 protein (15.Tosteson M.T. Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, due to its structural simplicity, the M2 ion channel is a potentially useful model for the study of ion channels in general. Based on calculations using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation and measurements of current reversal voltage, the M2 ion channel is thought to be at least 105-fold selective for protons (8.Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11.Chizhmakov I.V. Geraghty F.M. Ogden D.C. Hayhurst A. Antoniou M. Hay A.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 329-336Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar), although other monovalent cations may also permeate the channel (8.Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). M2 ion channel activity is increased when the pH of the extracellular domain is lowered (10.Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 11.Chizhmakov I.V. Geraghty F.M. Ogden D.C. Hayhurst A. Antoniou M. Hay A.J. J. Physiol.

Virol. 1996; 70: 4246-4252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This increase in activity occurs within the range of pH values expected for titration of histidine (17.Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The only amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein with a titratable group in this pH range is His37; and when His37 is replaced by Ala, Gly, or Glu, the proton selectivity of the channel is greatly reduced, and the channel is conductive over a wider range of pH values (10.Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 11.Chizhmakov I.V. Geraghty F.M. Ogden D.C. Hayhurst A. Antoniou M. Hay A.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 329-336Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that His37 forms a selectivity filter for protons (18.Pinto L.H. Dieckmann G.R. Gandhi C.S. Shaughnessy M.A. Papworth C.G. Braman J. Lear J.D. Lamb R.A. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11301-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Two possible mechanisms could account for the high proton selectivity of the M2 ion channel. First, it is possible that certain residues of the pore form a narrow selectivity filter through which only hydronium ions can pass. Second, a residue in the pore region might form part of a conducting pathway, perhaps a proton wire (19.DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 415-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), by providing a site highly favorable for interactions with protons. We distinguished between these possibilities by replacing the water solvent with D2O. We have observed that inward M2 currents sometimes decrease during a constant voltage clamp pulse to large negative voltages. Since M2 currents do not display rapid voltage- or time-dependent activation/inactivation, it is possible that the decrease in current is the result of insufficient buffer capacity at the external mouth of the channel. We tested this possibility by examining the effect of decreased buffer capacity on M2current amplitude. The cDNA to the influenza A/Udorn/72 mRNA was cloned into the BamHI site of pGEM3 such that mRNA sense transcripts could be generated by using the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter and T7 RNA polymerase. For in vitrotranscription, plasmid DNAs were linearized downstream of the T7 promoter and the M2 cDNA with XbaI. In vitro synthesis and quantification of m7G(5‚Ä≤)ppp(5‚Ä≤)G-capped mRNA were carried out as described previously (10.Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Oocytes were removed from female Xenopus laevis(NASCO, Fort Atkinson, WI), defolliculated by treatment with collagenase B (2 mg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 3.6 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, 5 mg/ml gentamicin, and 5 mmHEPES (pH 7.6), osmolality of ‚àº210 mosmol/kg) at 19 ¬∞C. Oocytes at stage V were microinjected with 50 nl of mRNA (1 ng/nl) on the day after defolliculation, incubated for 24 h in ND96 (pH 7.5), and finally incubated for 24 h in ND96 (pH 8.5) at 19 ¬∞C before use (10.Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 20.Colman A. Hames B.D. Higgins S.J. Transcription and Translation: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1984: 271-302Google Scholar). Metabolic labeling of oocytes and analysis of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were carried out as described previously (9.Holsinger L.J. Nichani D. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1551-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were cultured and infected with recombinant simian virus 40 expressing the M2 protein from influenza A/Udorn/72 (rSV40-M2) as described previously (12.Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Virology. 1994; 205: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, CV-1 cells grown to confluency at 37 ¬∞C and 5% CO2 in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin) were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in culture medium. Resuspended cells were incubated in the presence of high titer rSV40-M2(100 Œºl of resuspended CV-1 cells and 1 ml of virus stock) for 4 h. Infected cells were then diluted 1:1 in culture medium and seeded onto 5-mm square glass coverslips arranged in 3.5-cm Petri dishes (2-ml total volume/dish). Infected cells were incubated for 48 h before recording to ensure adequate M2 protein expression. The presence of M2 protein at the surface of infected CV-1 cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry as described previously (12.Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Virology. 1994; 205: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp. Electrodes were filled with 3m KCl, and the oocytes were bathed in either Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.3 mmNaNO3, 0.71 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, and 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), osmolality of ‚àº210 mosmol/kg) or a modified solution during the recording. Continuous current-voltage relationships were measured with ramps of membrane voltage since the M2 channel shows no rapid voltage- or time-dependent gating. These ramps typically spanned a range of 120 mV in 2 s. Oocyte holding potential was ‚àí20 mV unless stated otherwise. M2 currents were recorded from CV-1 cells using the whole cell patch clamp technique as described previously (12.Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Virology. 1994; 205: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, patch pipettes with tip diameters of ‚àº2‚Äì3 Œºm were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass, fire-polished, and then partially filled with pipette solution (145 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaCl, and 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) adjusted with KOH, osmolality of 300‚Äì310 mosmol/kg). Pipettes filled with this solution typically had resistances of ‚àº3‚Äì4 megaohms. CV-1 cells attached to glass coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber filled with ‚Äúhigh buffer‚Äù bath solution (140 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.55 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm glucose, and 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) or 15 mm MES1 (pH 6.2), osmolality of ‚àº300 mosmol/kg). Also used in experiments was a ‚Äúlow buffer‚Äù pH 6.2 solution that contained 25 Œºm bromcresol purple instead of 15 mm MES and additional NaCl to adjust the solution osmolality to 300 mosmol/kg. Seals (in excess of 10 gigaohms) were made by gently pressing the patch pipette against a CV-1 cell and then rapidly applying ‚àº12 mm Hg suction. The whole cell configuration was achieved by using a brief pulse of high voltage combined with gentle pipette suction. In the whole cell configuration, cells had access resistances of <10 megaohms. Cells were generally bathed in pH 7.4 solution and held at ‚àí20 mV. Whole cell currents were recorded after the bathing solution was changed from pH 7.4 to pH 6.2 using a Fast Step perfusion system (Model SF77B, Warner Instruments Corp., Hamden, CT). Using this system, solution changes could be made in <100 ms. M2-specific currents were identified by sensitivity to block by 100 Œºm amantadine. The nominal reading taken from a glass pH electrode (pHnom) deviates from the true pD of D2O solution by 0.4 units such that pD = pHnom + 0.4 (21.Glasoe P.K. Long F.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1960; 64: 188-190Crossref Scopus (2149) Google Scholar). Our pH meter read 0.41 ¬± 0.02 units (mean ¬± S.D.,n = 4) higher when 0.01 m HCl was added to H2O than when added to D2O. We therefore corrected the pD in D2O solutions by adding 0.41 to the nominal reading of our pH meter. As we have shown previously (10.Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 17.Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), whole cell currents recorded in oocytes expressing the M2 protein increase when the pH of the bathing medium is lowered (Fig. 1). This current is effectively blocked in the presence of 100 Œºm amantadine, an anti-influenza virus compound and inhibitor of M2 ion channel activity (10.Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that protons interact directly with the M2ion channel protein when traversing its pore region, we took advantage of some differences in the physical properties of H2 and D2. First, D2O is 1.25 times more viscous than H2O. If protons pass through the M2 channel as hydronium ions, then only a modest decrease in current on changing from H2O to D2O solvent would be expected according to the ratio of their viscosities. On the other hand, if protons traverse the M2 channel via a proton wire, involving the exchange of protons between H2O molecules occupying the channel pore, or if protons interact directly with the channel, then a larger conductance decrease upon changing from H2O to D2O should occur since there exists a large difference in both the mobilities and the zero point energies of protons and deuterons, respectively (19.DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 415-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 22.Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985: 147-149Google Scholar). To test between these possibilities, we compared the conductance and reversal voltage of M2-expressing oocytes bathed in water and D2O solvents. The water permeability of the oocyte membrane is very high, and it has been demonstrated that the external solvent will determine the internal solvent of the cell in these experiments (19.DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 415-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). An alteration of the internal solvent would be expected to modify the internal hydrogen ion concentration of the cell since the dissociation constant for many buffers is lower for protons than for deuterons. Thus, simply changing the external solvent from H2O to D2O at constant pLout (pHout or pDout) would be expected to increase the pLinof the ooplasm. We compared the conductance of M2-expressing oocytes at three or more values of pLout in the same oocyte between pLout = 5.0 and pLout = 7.5. This was done by first determining the current-voltage relationship at two or more values of pHout(Fig. 2). Next, the current-voltage relationship was determined in D2O solutions with the same values of pLout (Fig. 2). At least 20 s was allowed for equilibration of the solvent. This time was sufficient, as no differences were observed in the current-voltage relationships obtained 20 s and 2 min after changing the solvent. To check that irreversible changes did not occur in D2O, the relationship was again determined in water at pH 6.2. Finally, the relationship was determined in the presence of amantadine (pH 6.2). For every value of pLout tested, the current-voltage relationship of the amantadine-sensitive current had the same overall shape in both solvents, with a higher slope conductance for more negative membrane voltages (Fig. 2). Also, for every value of pLout tested, the relationship shifted to more positive voltages (Fig.3 A), and its slope decreased (by 50‚Äì60%) when D2O was substituted for H2O (Fig. 3 B).Figure 3A, relationship between reversal voltage of the amantadine-sensitive current (Vrev) and pLout (pHout or pDout). Shown are average values of Vrev measured in five oocytes in H2O (‚óè) and D2O (‚óã). Error barsshow means ¬± S.E. B, average ratios of slope conductance measured in D2O to slope conductance measured in H2O at ‚àí45 mV in five oocytes. Error barsshow means ¬± S.E. The dashed line shows the value expected if the ratios of the mobilities of H+ to D+ were the only factor that affected the conductance.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have often observed that the inward current of M2-expressing oocytes decreases slightly during a constant voltage clamp pulse to large negative voltages. This effect becomes more prevalent as the flow rate of the solution bathing the oocyte is decreased. One possible explanation for this observation is that the buffer concentration was inadequate to supply the channel with protons. Unlike ion channels that conduct Na+, Cl‚àí, Ca2+, etc., proton-selective ion channels are supplied with the conducting ion at a free concentration in the micromolar range. Free protons are supplied by dissociation from buffer molecules, enabling the total concentration of protons to greatly exceed the free concentration. To test this, we measured the dependence of M2 current amplitude on external buffer concentration. In solutions of low buffer concentration (<15 mm), amantadine-sensitive M2 currents measured inXenopus oocytes decreased with time and had smaller final current amplitudes (Fig. 4 A). M2 current decrease in low buffer was measured at a given voltage as the difference between the current amplitude in 15 mm buffer and the final current amplitude measured at lower buffer concentrations. At higher buffer concentrations (>15 mm), amantadine-sensitive M2 currents had approximately the same amplitude as those measured in 15 mmbuffer (Fig. 4 B). For a given buffer concentration, the magnitude of the current decrease in low buffer was proportional to the inward current amplitude in high buffer (Fig.5). The relationship between inward current decrease in low buffer and inward current amplitude in high buffer was steeper for lower buffer concentrations (Fig. 5). No change in current amplitude was observed in low buffer when cells were held at a voltage that corresponded to zero current, which for most cells was near the calculated proton equilibrium potential. Low external buffer concentrations also had no effect on the amplitude of outward M2 currents (data not shown).Figure 5Dependence of M2 current decrease on buffer concentration and the final current amplitude in M2-expressing oocytes. Net current decrease for three concentrations of MES buffer is plotted as a function of current amplitude in 15 mm MES. Data are from four oocytes (each represented by a different symbol) in the presence of 15, 1.5, or 0.15 mm MES at pH 5.8. For each oocyte, several final current amplitudes produced by hyperpolarizing voltage pulses of various amplitudes are shown. Lines through the data points are not significant. The inset shows an example of currents recorded in a single oocyte at pH 5.8 at each of the three concentrations of MES buffer. In this case, currents were evoked by a 2-s test pulse to ‚àí120 mV from a holding voltage of ‚àí20 mV. For a given final current, the decrease in M2 current became larger as the buffer concentration was decreased.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the limitation of M2 current by external buffer concentration was specific to oocytes, we compared the effects of low buffer concentration on M2 currents recorded in mammalian cells infected with rSV40-M2 (12.Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Virology. 1994; 205: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). M2 currents recorded in rSV40-M2-infected CV-1 cells using the whole cell patch clamp technique were severely reduced in amplitude when the external buffer concentration was decreased from 15 mm to 25 Œºm using bromcresol purple as a pH buffer (Fig.6). We chose to use bromcresol purple as a buffer since it undergoes a distinct color change below pH 6.0, allowing the approximate pH of the solution to be easily monitored during the experiment. On average, M2 currents recorded in the low buffer solution at ‚àí60 mV were decreased in amplitude to 31.0 ¬± 8.1% (n = 7) of those recorded in 15 mm buffer. Only a slight decrease in current was observed when the buffer concentration was reduced from 15 to 0.15 mm. On average, M2 currents recorded in 0.15 mm buffer at ‚àí60 mV were decreased in amplitude to 88.98 ¬± 2.17% of those recorded in 15 mm buffer (n = 4). M2 currents measured in CV-1 cells in low buffer were decreased in amplitude at all times during a constant voltage clamp pulse. This result is in contrast to oocytes in which the current in low buffer was seen to decrease over a matter of seconds during a voltage clamp pulse. The results demonstrate that the limitation of M2 current by buffer concentration is not restricted to oocytes and therefore suggest a common mechanism. The dependence of M2 current amplitude on external buffer concentration suggests that M2 proton currents can exceed the capacity of the buffer to deliver protons at the channel mouth, thus resulting in a transient extracellular alkalinization. The occurrence of a transient alkalinization in low buffer has already been suggested in Fig.4 A (arrow), where there was an ‚Äúovershoot‚Äù of current following a hyperpolarizing pulse. If alkalinization occurs, then the reversal voltage for the M2 current (Vrev) measured in low buffer should be shifted to a more negative voltage since the pH gradient across the channel would be transiently decreased under this condition. To test this hypothesis, the following experiment was performed. Vrev was measured using voltage ramps evoked first while the oocyte was bathed in high buffer, then while it was bathed in low buffer, and finally again while it was bathed in high buffer (Fig. 7). Rapid voltage ramps were necessary to measure the effect of depletion on Vrev since there should be no depletion occurring at true Vrev. We found that at a holding potential of ‚àí20 mV, which produces a large inward current at pH 5.8, Vrevshifted in the low buffer solution toward more negative voltages by ‚àí12.5 ¬± 1.0 mV (n = 9). The transient shift of Vrev in the low buffer solution was larger for more negative holding potentials, which was consistent with greater depletion. The transient shift of Vrev in low buffer could be prevented by holding cells at a voltage that corresponded to zero inward current (data not shown). The incomplete recovery of Vrev in high buffer following exposure to the low buffer solution is thought to be the result of gradual oocyte acidification while bathed in low pH solutions (8.Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with this explanation was a small change in Vrev (2‚Äì5 mV) toward more negative voltages observed in oocytes exposed only to a highly buffered solution (data not shown). The mostly reversible shift of Vrev in low buffer to more negative values is consistent with the notion that the M2 current decrease in low buffer is the result of proton depletion in the bulk solution near the extracellular mouth of the M2 channel. Xenopus oocytes are surrounded by the vitelline membrane, which, among other functions, serves to maintain oocyte structural integrity. For this reason, the vitelline membrane is generally left intact for ion channel recording. It was possible that the greater sensitivity of M2 currents in oocytes to low external buffer concentrations and the slower time course of current decrease compared with those recorded in mammalian cells may have been the result of the vitelline membrane acting as a diffusion barrier for protonated buffer molecules. We therefore tested the effect of decreased buffer concentration in oocytes from which the vitelline membranes had been removed and compared the results to those obtained in vitelline-intact oocytes. M2 currents recorded in oocytes with no vitelline membrane decreased in a similar manner to those recorded in vitelline-intact oocytes when bathed in buffer at concentrations below 15 mm (n = 10; data not shown). This result demonstrates that the greater sensitivity of M2 currents to low external buffer concentrations seen in oocytes is not the result of the vitelline membrane impeding buffer diffusion to the mouth of the M2 channel. We wished to determine if proton depletion in low external buffer occurred in the macroscopic solution shared by all channels as the result of combined proton flux through multiple M2 channels or whether the deduced depletion was localized to the bulk solution surrounding the macromolecular complex of each M2 channel. Assuming the same mean channel conductance for all M2 channels, oocytes expressing a greater total number of channels (i.e. expression level) should, for a given voltage and pH, have proportionally larger currents. If proton depletion in low buffer is channel-localized, then the ratio of current amplitude in low buffer to current amplitude in high buffer should be constant for a given voltage and pH, regardless of the expression level. On the other hand, if current decrease is due to the cooperative effect of many channels to deplete protons from the macroscopic solution, then the ratio of current amplitude in low buffer to current amplitude in high buffer should decrease with expression level. To distinguish between these two possibilities, M2current amplitude was measured at high and low buffer concentrations at a constant voltage and pH in individual oocytes, each with many levels of expression. The ratio of current amplitude in low buffer to current amplitude in high buffer was then plotted for each oocyte against the amplitude of the current measured in the high buffer solution (Fig.8). We found that the ratio of current amplitude in low buffer to current amplitude in high buffer for oocytes with different levels of expression was approximately constant, suggesting that proton depletion is a channel-localized phenomenon. Buffer capacity at a given pH is dependent on both the concentration of protonated buffer species and the buffer pK a. We therefore tested whether M2currents measured at a buffer concentration found previously to adequately supply the channel (e.g. 15 mm) could also be limited by changing the buffer pK a at a constant pH (Fig. 9). This was done by measuring M2 currents at pH 6.2 and pH 4.4 in the presence of 15 mm MES (pK a = 6.1), HEPES (pK a = 7.4), or tartaric acid (pK a = 4.2). At pH 6.2, currents measured in 15 mm MES did not decrease measurably at a given voltage. However, a smaller current amplitude was observed when the external solution was buffered with HEPES or tartaric acid. The smallest M2 current amplitude at pH 6.2 was observed when tartaric acid was used as a buffer. At this pH, tartaric acid would be the least protonated of the three buffer species. In contrast, tartaric acid provided the largest current of the three buffers when the experiment was repeated at pH 4.4, even though at this pH, both HEPES and MES are highly protonated. We chose to measure currents at pH 4.4 instead of pH 4.2 (the pK a of tartaric acid) in order to minimize acidification and subsequent oocyte damage, which occurs at low pH values. The results thus demonstrate that M2 currents are limited by buffer capacity and not just the concentration of protonated buffer species. Our results are consistent with a model for proton conduction across the M2 ion channel in which protons donated from buffer molecules interact with a titratable group within the channel pore. At least one such group lies within the electric field of the membrane and is probably His37. Comparison of the conductance measured in water and D2O suggests that hydrogen ions do not pass through the channel in the form of hydronium ions. If this were the case, only a modest decrease in conductance would be expected due the greater viscosity of D2O, ‚àº20%. Instead, we found that the slope conductance, measured over a range of ‚àº1.5 pH units, decreased by 40‚Äì50% (Fig.3 B). The greater decrease in conductance could be explained either by deuterons having a greater affinity than protons for a titratable group lining the M2 channel pore (22.Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985: 147-149Google Scholar) or by the large difference in the mobilities of protons in H2O and deuterons in D2O (19.DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 415-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that one of the ionizable groups of the channel that binds the conducting protons lies within the electric field of the membrane. First, the slope conductance of the current-voltage relationship increases for negative voltages (Fig. 1). The voltage dependence that we measured is similar to that found previously in mouse erythroleukemia cells (11.Chizhmakov I.V. Geraghty F.M. Ogden D.C. Hayhurst A. Antoniou M. Hay A.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 329-336Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Second, site-directed mutagenesis experiments have shown that His37 is essential for the activation of the current of the M2 channel by low pH (17.Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Experiments with various transition metals have shown that the channel can be inhibited with Cu2+ and that the high affinity site for inhibition results from coordination of Cu2+ with His37 (23.Gandhi C.S. Shuck K. Lear J.D. Dieckmann G.R. DeGrado W.F. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5474-5482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This inhibition is strongly voltage-dependent, indicating that His37 lies within the electric field of the membrane. It thus seems likely that His37 binds protons as they traverse the pore of the channel (18.Pinto L.H. Dieckmann G.R. Gandhi C.S. Shaughnessy M.A. Papworth C.G. Braman J. Lear J.D. Lamb R.A. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11301-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The conclusion that hydrogen ions interact with the pore region of the M2 ion channel has implications for the single channel conductance expected from this proton-selective channel. The M2 single channel current can be estimated in the following three ways. 1) The maximum theoretical flux of hydrogen ions would be limited by the reverse reaction rate constant of the titratable group to which the hydrogen ions bind. If this group is His37(pK a ‚àº 6), then the calculated value of the reverse reaction rate constant (His¬∑H+ + H2O ‚Üí His + H3O+) is on the order of 1.7 √ó 104/s (22.Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1985: 147-149Google Scholar). The maximum single channel current to be expected based upon this value and assuming four His37residues per M2 channel macromolecular complex is ‚àº10 fA. 2) We found that M2 currents measured at a given voltage in CV-1 cells diminished if the buffer concentration of the oocyte bathing solution was below ‚àº0.15 mm. Thus, the number of protons supplied to a single M2 channel macromolecular complex in 0.15 mm buffer must be roughly equal to the number of protons traversing the channel during maximum flux. Assuming that the mobility of a proton in H2O is very high, ‚àº10‚àí4 (cm/s)/(V/cm) (24.Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. 2nd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1992: 261-290Google Scholar), then the limiting step in the transfer of protons to His37 would be the dissociation of protons from the buffer molecules. Assuming (a) that the proton dissociation rate is 105/s for a buffer of pK a = 6 and (b) that protons diffuse into the channel from a hemispherical sink with a radius of 5 ‚Ñ´, then the maximum current possible from 0.15 mm buffer would be equal to the number of protonated buffer molecules in the sink multiplied by the proton dissociation rate, a value of ‚àº1 fA. 3) The final way in which the M2 single channel current can be estimated is by dividing the total current recorded in M2-expressing oocytes by the number of M2channels per oocyte. The total current measured at pH 6.2 and a membrane voltage of ‚àí130 mV is ‚àº0.7 ŒºA. The number of M2 channels per oocyte can be calculated by assuming that there is ‚àº3 ng of M2 protein expressed per oocyte and by using a molecular weight for the M2 tetrameric channel of 60,000 (9.Holsinger L.J. Nichani D. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1551-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given that ‚àº50% of the M2 protein is present at the cell surface (7.Sakaguchi T. Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), the calculated current per M2channel is ‚àº0.5 fA. All three calculations suggest that the M2 single channel current is very small. Two reports of a larger single channel activity of the M2 ion channel have appeared in the literature. The first study used a synthetic transmembrane peptide and reported a conductance of 10 picosiemens (14.Duff K.C. Ashley R.H. Virology. 1992; 190: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, this value was obtained at pH 2.3 in glycine buffer, far from the pH range accessible to electrophysiological investigations. The second study utilized affinity-purified M2 protein and did not report consistent single channel conductances (15.Tosteson M.T. Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 142: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Such inconsistency of single channel conductance perhaps resulted from aggregation of the protein in the membrane (25.Lear J.D. Wasserman Z.R. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1988; 240: 1179-1181Crossref Scopus (468) Google Scholar). In a patch clamp study of stably transfected mammalian cells, Chizhmakov et al.(11.Chizhmakov I.V. Geraghty F.M. Ogden D.C. Hayhurst A. Antoniou M. Hay A.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1996; 494: 329-336Crossref Scopus (262) Google Scholar) reported that M2 single channel currents were not detectable. Our results lend support to the expectation that the M2 single channel current would be below the detectable range of conventional single channel recording techniques. We found some differences in M2 currents recorded inXenopus oocytes and CV-1 cells. First, M2currents in CV-1 cells are not as sensitive to external buffer concentration as those recorded in Xenopus oocytes (Figs.Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). Second, M2 currents recorded in CV-1 cells in low buffer decrease and reach a lower steady-state current almost instantaneously compared with those recorded in Xenopusoocytes, which decrease over a matter of seconds. This was not the result of the oocyte vitelline membrane acting as a diffusion barrier, as removing the vitelline membrane made no difference to the time course of current decrease. One possibility is that there is a greater M2 current density in oocytes, which leads to more protons being depleted from the surrounding solution. This can be tested by calculating the M2 current density of M2-expressing oocytes and comparing this with the equivalent value obtained from CV-1 cells. M2 current density can be calculated by dividing the whole cell current at a given voltage and pH by the cell-surface area. The latter can be calculated using the standard cell membrane capacitance of 1 microfarad/cm2. The calculated values for M2current density in oocytes and CV-1 cells are similar, being 0.04 and 0.06 pA/Œºm2, respectively. A third possibility is that the presence of surface villi in oocytes (but not in CV-1 cells) increases the unstirred layer at the oocyte surface, leading to greater ion depletion through insufficient mixing with the bulk solution (26.Stuhmer W. Parekh A.B. Sakman B. Neher E. Single Channel Recording. 2 Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1995: 344Google Scholar). If this is the case, then the protonated buffer concentration in the unstirred layer near the mouth of the M2 channel may be different from the protonated buffer concentration in the macroscopic solution shared by all channels. Thus, the actual concentration of buffer below which oocyte M2currents decrease may be closer to the value obtained in CV-1 cells, which have a comparatively smooth surface. The presence of villi causing a diffusion barrier might also explain the slower time course of current decrease observed in oocytes. Although the effect of surface villi on M2 currents could not be tested directly, the presence of an unstirred layer is suggested by the observation that oocyte currents could be decreased by reducing the bathing solution flow rate even in 15 mm buffer. M2 current amplitude at a given pH was found to be strongly dependent on the buffer pK a. M2 currents decreased in amplitude when the buffer pK a differed from the solution pH (Fig. 9) even though a relatively high buffer concentration was used. This result can be explained in the same way as the dependence of M2 current amplitude on external buffer concentration by assuming that a buffer is at maximum capacity to provide protons to the solution only when the pK a of the buffer equals the pH of the solution. Our results cannot, however, distinguish between the following mechanisms: 1) protons are transferred from the buffer to water molecules to form hydronium ions, which then donate protons to titratable groups in the channel pore; and 2) protons are transferred directly from the buffer to a group in the channel with a pK a similar to that of water. Our results suggest that protons passing through the M2 ion channel interact directly with the channel protein instead of passing through the channel as hydronium ions. We demonstrate that M2 currents can be limited by buffer capacity and are in contrast to those obtained with other proton-specific channels through which proton flux was not limited by modest decreases in buffer capacity (27.Byerly L. Suen Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1989; 413: 75-89Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28.DeCoursey T.E. Cherny V.V. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 182-193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In previous work (10.Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 17.Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), we have demonstrated that His37 is an essential residue for pH sensitivity of the M2 channel, and thus, this residue would be expected to be a site for proton binding to the channel molecule. Modification of the imidazole side chain of His37 may reveal the atoms that participate in this interaction."

Recent evidence suggests that the Fas signals, which lead to cell death, can be more complex than this simple pathway, perhaps involving multiple intracellular mechanisms. For example, caspase 8 has been shown to cleave BID, which induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria and subsequently cell death (6.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3080) Google Scholar, 7.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3789) Google Scholar). In addition, engagement of Fas has been shown to lead to cell death by activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase pathway via DAXX (8.Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). This latter pathway appears to be independent of FADD and caspase 8 (9.Chang H.Y. Yang X. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A major controversy that surrounds the Fas-mediated cell death pathway is the role of ceramide and acidic sphingomyelinase (aSMase).1 Ceramide is a lipid that has been shown to be a potent mediator of apoptosis (10.Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hunnun Y.A. Science. 1993; 295: 1769-1771Crossref Scopus (1612) Google Scholar). After engagement of the Fas receptor, intracellular ceramide levels increase rapidly, and it is this increase that is believed to be involved in the apoptotic death of the cell (11.Cifone M.G.

Present evidence suggests that the ceramide produced after Fas engagement is generated by both aSMase and neutral SMase, which hydrolyzes sphingomyelin into ceramide and phosphocholine (11.Cifone M.G. De Maria R. Roncaioli P. Rippo M.R. Azuma M. Lanier L.L. Santoni A. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). However, a recent study reported that the increase in ceramide occurs at a late time point, paralleling the onset of cell death (16.Tepper A.D. Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that the increase in ceramide is a consequence and not a direct mediator of cell death. In addition, studies on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells derived from patients with Niemann-Pick disease, which have very low levels of acidic sphingomyelinase, have also been conflicting. De Maria et al. (17.De Maria R. Rippo M.R. Schuchman E.H. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) report that Niemann-Pick disease-derived B cells are protected from Fas-mediated cell death, yet Boesen-de Cock et al. (18.Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7560-7565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) report that Niemann-Pick disease B cells are sensitive to Fas-mediated cell death. To help clarify whether aSMase is involved in Fas-mediated cell death, we examined the ability of primary cells derived from aSMase-deficient mice (aSMase‚àí/‚àí) to undergo cell death in response to anti-Fas antibody or soluble Fas ligand (sFasL). We found that thymic and splenic cells derived from aSMase‚àí/‚àí and aSMase+/+ mice are equally sensitive to Fas-mediated cell death in vitro. Furthermore, ceramide generation after Fas engagement was not impaired in these cells derived from aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice. In in vivo studies, intravenous injection of an optimal dose of anti-Fas antibody into aSMase knock-out mice failed to affect hepatocyte apoptosis or death, whereas massive hepatocyte apoptosis and animal death from liver damage ensued in wild type littermates. This role for aSMase was bypassed by administration of higher antibody doses. These data indicate a role for aSMase in some but not all forms of Fas-mediated cell death. Mice deficient in the aSMase gene (19.Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction of tail DNA as described previously (19.Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Primers 5‚Ä≤-AGCCGTGTCCTCTTCCTTAC-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-CGAGACTGTTGCCAGACATC-3‚Ä≤ were used to amplify a 269-base pair product that is specific for exon 2 of the wild type aSMase gene. Primer 5‚Ä≤-AGCCGTGTCCTCTTCCTTAC-3‚Ä≤ and the neomycin gene-specific antisense primer 5‚Ä≤-GGCTACCCGTGATATTGCTG-3‚Ä≤ were used to amplify a 523-base pair product that was specific for the mutant gene containing part of the neo cassette and exon 2 of the aSMase gene. Polymerase chain reaction consisted of 50 -Œºl reactions containing 1√ó Qiagen polymerase chain reaction buffer (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA), 1√ó Qiagen Q solution, 1 Œºg of tail DNA, 20 pmol of each primer, 0.5 mm dNTP, and 5 units ofTaq polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Polymerase chain reaction amplification conditions consisted of 32 cycles, 1 min at 94 ¬∞C, 1 min at 60 ¬∞C, and 1 min at 72 ¬∞C. All mice were raised under specific pathogen-free conditions in the animal care facility at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology or at the Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Age- and gender-matched littermates (wild type, aSMase knock-out and heterozygote) 9 to 12 weeks of age were injected via the retro-orbital sinus with anti-mouse Fas antibody Jo-2 (3‚Äì5 Œºg/25 g mouse body weight) in a total volume of 100 Œºl in 0.9% saline. Mice were checked hourly for mortality. Kaplan-Meyer actuarial analysis was performed using the computer-assisted system for patient data entry and retrieval (CASPER) statistical package. For pathologic analysis, animals manifesting an agonal breathing pattern or survivors 60 h post-injection were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation. Spleen cells and thymocytes were isolated by gently meshing the respective organs between two frosted slides followed by filtering through cotton gauze. Two-color FACS analysis was performed with a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. The data were analyzed with the Cell Quest program. All antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Antibodies and reagents used were as follow: FITC-conjugated and unconjugated anti-Fas (Jo-2), FITC-conjugated anti-CD4 and phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-CD8a, FITC-conjugated anti-B220 and phosphatidylethanolamine -conjugated anti-CD3. ConA-activated T cell blasts were produced by stimulating Ficoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)-purified mononuclear cells from naive spleen for two days with 5 Œºg/ml ConA (Sigma). LPS-activated B cells blasts were produced by culturing Ficoll-purified mononuclear cells from whole spleen stimulated with 15 Œºg/ml lipopolysaccharide (Sigma). Cell death was assessed by flow cytometry by double staining with propidium iodide and FITC-conjugated annexin V (Pharmingen). Unless otherwise stated, cell death was reported as percentage propidium iodide uptake. Similar results were obtained when % annexin V staining was used to assess cell death, except that it resulted in higher sensitivity and background. Soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) was a kind gift from J. Tschopp (University of Lausanne, Switzerland). Cell death was induced with flag-tagged sFasL by cross-linking it with an anti-Flag mAb (M2, 1 Œºg/ml) (Sigma) as described previously (20.Schneider P.N.H. Bodmer J. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Ceramide levels were measured as described previously (15.Genestier L. Prigent A.F. Paillot R. Quemeneur L. Durand I. Banchereau J. Revillard J.P. Bonnefoy-Berard N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5060-5666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In brief, ceramide was quantified by the diacylglycerol kinase assay as 32P incorporated upon phosphorylation of ceramide to ceramide 1-phosphate by glycerol kinase from Escherichia coli (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). LPS blasts were starved for 2 h in RPMI containing 2% bovine serum albumin and then treated with different monoclonal antibodies for the indicated times. Ceramide 1-phosphate was resolved by TLC using CHCl3/CH3OH/CH3COOH (65:15:5, v/v) as solvent. Authentic ceramide 1-phosphate was identified by autoradiography at rf 0.25, and the ceramide concentration was determined by comparison to concomitantly run standard comprised of known amounts of natural ceramide type 3 (Sigma) and normalized to 3H triglyceride introduced during lipid extraction. Before assessing the susceptibility of aSMase‚àí/‚àí derived cells to undergo Fas-mediated cell death, we examined surface expression of Fas. We found that thymocytes from aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice expressed similar levels of Fas compared with wild type aSMase+/+ littermate controls (Fig.1 a). Fig. 1 bdemonstrates that naive spleen cells from both mice expressed little or no levels of Fas, and upon ConA activation, Fas expression increased equally in both. Similar results were obtained with LPS-activated spleen cells (data not shown). Therefore, Fas expression is not affected by the absence of aSMase. To directly assess the contribution of aSMase in Fas-mediated cell death, we analyzed the susceptibility of lymphocytes from aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice to die from Fas-mediated cell death with anti-Fas mAb (Jo-2). As shown in Fig.2 a, thymocytes from aSMase‚àí/‚àí and littermate aSMase+/+ mice were equally sensitive to cell death induced by anti-Fas antibody. Similarly, ConA- and LPS-activated spleen cells from both aSMase‚àí/‚àí and aSMase+/+ mice were equally sensitive to Fas-mediated cell death (Figs. 2, b andc). Because engagement of Fas can potentially lead to the activation of multiple pathways leading to cell death, we considered the possibility that aSMase mediates Fas-mediated cell death more rapidly than the other pathways. Hence, it is plausible that the lack of differences in Fig. 2, a‚Äìc, was due to an examination of cell viability 16 h after anti-Fas stimulation, by which time an alternative pathway may have resulted in cell death independently of aSMase. To address this issue, we examined cell death at earlier time points (4, 6, and 12 h). As shown in Fig. 2 d, cell death in thymocytes from aSMase+/+ and aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice occurred at the same rate following treatment with anti-Fas antibody. Similar results were obtained with ConA- and LPS-activated T cells (data not shown). sFasL, when cross-linked, readily induces cell death in Fas-sensitive cells (20.Schneider P.N.H. Bodmer J. Hahne M. Frei K. Fontana A. Tschopp J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that aSMase is involved in cell death induced by cross-linked sFasL. Fig.3 a demonstrates that aSMase+/+ and aSMase‚àí/‚àí thymocytes were equally susceptible to cell death induced by cross-linked sFasL. Similarly, aSMase+/+ and aSMase‚àí/‚àí ConA- and LPS-activated spleen cells were also examined for their susceptibility to cell death mediated by cross-linked sFasL, and again, no differences were observed (Fig. 3, b‚Äìc). Fig. 3 d summarizes our results from several independent experiments comparing cells from aSMase+/+ and aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice for their susceptibility to ligation of Fas with anti-Fas antibody or sFasL. In the figure we compare the extent of cell death in aSMase+/+ and aSMase‚àí/‚àí cells at different doses of antibody or ligand. The slopes of the curves are close to 1, indicating a lack of difference between these two cell sources in their sensitivity to Fas ligation. Overall these results demonstrate that aSMase is not necessary for Fas-mediated cell death of lymphocytes. T cell activation-induced cell death has been shown to be mediated primarily by activation-induced FasL expression and subsequent Fas/FasL interaction (21.Brunner T. Mogil R. LaFace D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Escheverri F. Martin S.J. Force W.R. Lynch D, H. Ware C.F. Green D.R. Nature. 1995; 373: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar, 22.Brunner T. Yoo N.J. LaFace D. Ware C.F.

Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the susceptibility of T cells from aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice to undergo activation-induced cell death. In the experiments shown in Fig. 3 e, aSMase+/+ and aSMase‚àí/‚àí ConA-activated spleen cells were re-stimulated with anti-CD3, which resulted in similar levels of cell death. Since this process proceeds predominantly via Fas/FasL interaction, this result is consistent with an absence of a role for aSMase in Fas-mediated cell death under physiological conditions of activation-induced cell death. Recent evidence suggests that depending on the type of cell, Fas-mediated cell death can potentially involve at least one of two pathways (25.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M. EMBO J. 1998; 16: 1675-1687Crossref Scopus (2631) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that aSMase is not involved in Fas-mediated cell death of lymphocytes but is involved in Fas-mediated cell death of nonlymphoid cells. In this regard, in vivo injection of anti-Fas into mice has been shown to induce death and massive hepatic injury (26.Ogasawara J. Watanbe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y. Itoh N. Suda T. Nagata S. Nature. 1993; 364: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar), although it is unclear whether the liver damage is responsible for the death of the animals. Transgenic mice that overexpress Bcl-2 in hepatocytes have been shown to be resistant to liver injury from anti-Fas injection, yet these transgenic mice readily succumb to the lethal effect of the injection (27.Rodriguez I. Matsuura K. Khatib K. Reed J.C. Nagata S. Vassalli P. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1031-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). To assess the involvement of aSMase in Fas-mediated hepatic injury, we injected 8-week-old aSMase‚àí/‚àí and aSMase+/+mice intravenously with various doses of anti-Fas and monitored survival after injection. Fig. 4demonstrates that at 3 Œºg/25 g mouse of anti-Fas intravenous there was a striking difference observed between the aSMase‚àí/‚àíand aSMase+/+ mice. Animals lacking aSMase were completely resistant to the effects of the antibody (all mice surviving at 24 h continued to survive). Fig. 5 shows the appearance of the livers from an aSMase‚àí/‚àí and an aSMase+/+ mouse following intravenous injection with 3 Œºg/25 g mouse of anti-Fas antibody. Extensive damage in the +/+ liver was apparent at both the macroscopic (insets) and microscopic levels, with extensive apoptosis of the hepatocytes seen as chromatin condensation. In contrast, the liver of the representative anti-Fas-treated aSMase‚àí/‚àí mouse appeared completely normal.Figure 5Livers from both aSMase +/+ and aSMase ‚àí/‚àí mice are not equally sensitive to anti-Fas injection. ASMase+/+ mice (left), but not aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice (right), suffered severe hepatic injury after injection of 3 Œºg of anti-Fas/25 g mouse. Shown are H&E staining of liver sections and gross macroscopic examination (insets).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Furthermore, at this dose of antibody there was also a significant resistance observed in aSMase+/‚àí heterozygotes (7/11 survivors) compared with +/+ mice (2/11 survivors, p < 0.03 versus +/‚àí). Homozygous ‚àí/‚àíanimals were completely resistant to intravenous injection of 3 Œºg/25 g mouse anti-Fas in this experiment (11/11 survivors) (the data from homozygous animals are part of the survival study in Fig. 4). However, at doses exceeding 4 Œºg/25 g mouse, aSMase+/+and aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice were equally susceptible to the lethal effect of anti-Fas. Gross and microscopic examination of the liver revealed that all aSMase+/+ and aSMase‚àí/‚àímice, which died from anti-Fas injection, showed evidence of significant hepatic injury (Fig. 5 and data not shown). Similarly, we found no difference between the aSMase‚àí/‚àí and aSMase+/+ mice in their susceptibility to >5 Œºg anti-Fas injected intraperitoneally (data not shown). These studies indicate the existance of aSMase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways in Fas-mediated cell death and show that the aSMase-dependent pathway can be bypassed by supralethal doses of anti-Fas antibody. Although our results suggest that aSMase is not required for Fas-mediated cell death in B and T cells, we cannot rule out the possibility that ceramide is involved in this process. Other enzymes such as neutral sphingomyelinase and ceramide synthetase have been shown to be capable of producing ceramide. Therefore, it is possible that enzymes other than aSMase can potentially induce an increase in ceramide level after Fas engagement. To help clarify this issue, we examined ceramide levels from LPS-activated B cell blasts from aSMase‚àí/‚àí and aSMase+/+ mice after Fas engagement. As shown in Fig. 6, aSMase+/+ LPS-activated B cells initially appear to produce slightly more ceramide than aSMase‚àí/‚àí cells after engagement with anti-Fas. At later times, the cells from aSMase‚àí/‚àí animals were capable of producing similarly high levels of ceramide to those of wild type animals. Thus, although this result is consistent with our observation that aSMase is not necessary for Fas-mediated cell death in B and T cells, it does not rule out the possibility that ceramide plays a role in the process of Fas-mediated cell death in these cells. As a result of a viral transposon insertion in the intron of the Fas gene, lpr mice express no functional Fas (28.Watanabe-Fukunaga R. Brannan C.I. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nagata S. Nature. 1992; 356: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar, 29.Nagata S. Semin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 3-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These mice consequently develop severe lymphoproliferative disease resulting in massive enlargement of lymphoid organs, largely as a result of massive accumulation of CD3+ B220+ T cells. Therefore, signaling through Fas suppresses the development of lymphoproliferative disease. Interestingly, recent evidence suggests that the Fas-mediated signal, which prevents this lymphoproliferative disease, may be distinct from the Fas-mediated signal that leads to cell death. T cells from transgenic mice that overexpress crmA, a potent caspase 8 inhibitor, have been shown to be resistant to Fas-induced cell death yet do not develop lymphoproliferative disease (30.Walsh C.R. Wen B.G. Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rouke K. Dixit V. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Although we saw no evidence that aSMase plays a role in the Fas-mediated signal that leads to lymphocyte death, we investigated the possibility that aSMase may be involved in the Fas-mediated signal that prevents this lymphoproliferative disease. Fig.7, however, demonstrates that the spleens of aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice are of normal size and do not display an accumulation of large numbers of CD3+B220+ T cells. Similar results were observed with lymphocytes from the lymph nodes of aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice (data not shown). Ligation of Fas engages a potent and rapid signaling mechanism that results in apoptosis in a variety of cell types (26.Ogasawara J. Watanbe-Fukunaga R. Adachi M. Matsuzawa A. Kasugai T. Kitamura Y.

This signaling generally involves the recruitment of an adapter protein, FADD/Mort-1, to the cytoplasmic domain of Fas (2.Chinnaiyan A.M. O' Rouke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

FADD, in turn, recruits procaspase 8 molecules, which transprocess each other to the highly active mature form (35.Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rouke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C.

Caspase-8 then processes and activates its substrates, including other caspases, leading to apoptosis (3.Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Golstev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 1996: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2111) Google Scholar). Fas ligation also induces the production of ceramide, and since ceramide is known to be capable of triggering apoptosis, this pathway may contribute to Fas-mediated cell death (12.Tepper C.G. Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A. Wolff R. Yonehara S. Hannun Y.A. Seldin M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8443-8447Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 13.Cifone M.G. Roncaioli P.

Baier G. Baier-Bitterlich G. Byrd C. Lang F. Kolesnick R. Altman A. Green D.R. Immunity. 1995; 2: 341-345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Several studies have implicated aSMase as the enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing sphingomyelin to produce ceramide following Fas ligation, and aSMase activity increases following ligation of this receptor (11.Cifone M.G. De Maria R. Roncaioli P. Rippo M.R. Azuma M. Lanier L.L. Santoni A. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1547-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 36.Tonnetti L. Veri M.C. Bonvini E. D'Adamio L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). How this occurs remains unclear, although some recent reports have shown that aSMase activation following Fas ligation is dependent on caspase activity, presumably through the action of caspase 8 (15.Genestier L. Prigent A.F. Paillot R. Quemeneur L. Durand I. Banchereau J. Revillard J.P. Bonnefoy-Berard N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5060-5666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 37.Brenner B. Ferlinz K. Grassme H. Weller M. Koppenhoefer U. Dichgans J. Sandhoff K. Lang F. Gulbins E. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 38.Sillence D.J. Allen D. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We have confirmed this using caspase inhibitors but were unable to detect caspase-mediated cleavage of aSMase, which might account for it. 2E. Skowronski and D. R. Green, unpublished observations. Nevertheless, if aSMase and the ceramide pathway function downstream of the Fas signals discussed above to contribute to apoptosis, this is of vital importance to our understanding of this death process. The experiments described herein were undertaken to determine this. The simplest interpretation of our results is that aSMase is not required for Fas-mediated apoptosis of thymocytes, T cell blasts, or B cell blasts. Consistent with this notion, aSMase‚àí/‚àíanimals do not manifest an lpr-like phenotype. In contrast, our results in vivo indicate a conditional requirement for aSMase in Fas-mediated death. At an optimal dose of anti-Fas antibody (3 Œºg/25 g mouse, intravenous), the effect of the aSMase null mutation was dramatic; these animals were significantly resistant to the highly lethal effects of this antibody (Fig. 4). This was mirrored in the appearance of the hepatocytes; apoptosis in the +/+ animals treated with this dose of anti-Fas was not seen in the treated ‚àí/‚àí animals. Furthermore, significant protection was afforded in the aSMase heterozygotes, indicating a sensitivity to gene dosage. The heterozygous animals, like the human carrier state, do not manifest Niemann-Pick disease, indicating that aSMase effects on apoptosis are independent of any potential deleterious effects of this disease process. Supralethal amounts of anti-Fas can override this effect, resulting in death of the ‚àí/‚àí animals. However, if limiting FasL is available for some physiological effects, it is not unlikely that in such cases aSMase is essential to the maintenance of the Fas-mediated apoptotic signal. Our data suggest selective preference for such a role for aSMase depending not only on the strength of inductive signal but also on cell type. Fas-mediated apoptosis of T and B cells plays critical roles in the control of immune responses (39.Rathmell J.C. Cooke M.P. Ho W.Y. Grein J. Townsend S.E. Davis M.M. Goodnow C.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 40.Rathmell J.C Townsend S.E. Xu J.C Flavell R.A. Goodnow C.C.

Immunity. 1994; 1: 365-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar), and roles for Fas-mediated death in thymocyte maturation have been suggested (44.Kishimoto H. Surh C.D. Sprent J. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 45.Fleck M Zhou T. Tatsuta T. Yang P. Wang Z. Mountz J.D. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 3766-3775PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Fas-mediated apoptosis of hepatocytes appears to be involved in liver damage as a result of viral hepatitis (46.Kondo T. Suda T. Fukuyama H. Adachi M. Nagata S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Thus, the cells we examined for aSMase involvement in Fas-mediated apoptosis include those in which Fas is known to play a role in normal homeostasis or pathogenesis. Our studies do not rule out a role for ceramide in Fas-mediated apoptosis even in B and T cells, since ceramide production following Fas ligation still occurred (Fig. 6). It is possible that another enzyme such as neutral SMase can compensate for the absence of acidic SMase. Consistent with this possibility, Tonnetti et al. (36.Tonnetti L. Veri M.C. Bonvini E. D'Adamio L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that engagement of Fas results in activation of both acidic and neutral SMase. Our findings in lymphoid cells are consistent with those of Boesen-de Cock et al. (18.Boesen-de Cock J.G.R. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7560-7565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), who examined Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells from Niemann-Pick patients with genetic defects in aSMase. They found that ligation of Fas induced both apoptosis and ceramide production in these cells and that, although transfer of wild-type aSMase gene into these cells restored aSMase activity, it had no effect on cell death induced by anti-Fas antibodies. Similarly, in another study, several inhibitors of aSMase activity failed to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis as well (47.Gamen S. Anel A. Pineiro A. Naval J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These observations together with our studies using primary lymphoid cells from aSMase‚àí/‚àí mice support the idea that aSMase is not necessary for Fas-mediated apoptosis in lymphoid cells. This is in contrast to the studies of De Maria et al. (17.De Maria R. Rippo M.R. Schuchman E.H. Testi R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), who also employed Niemann-Pick lymphoblast lines and conclude that aSMase was required for Fas-mediated apoptosis and that restoration of wild type activity (by uptake of wild type protein) restored the response to Fas. This study suggests a role for aSMase in Fas-signaling in lymphoid cells but may be open to interpretation, since the virally transformed cell lines used may have lost susceptibility to Fas for reasons other than that of defects in the primary cells. As noted above, our studies do not address the requirement for ceramide production in Fas-mediated cell death, but some recent observations suggest that it may not be required in lymphoid cells. In one study, a number of inhibitors of ceramide-induced apoptosis were identified, and these failed to affect Fas-mediated apoptosis, thus effectively separating the phenomena (48.Hsu S.C. Wu C.C Luh T.Y. Chou C.K. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. Blood. 1998; 91: 2659-2663Crossref Google Scholar). In another study, a lymphoid line treated with a calcium ionophore showed a large increase in ceramide production but not apoptosis, although ligation of Fas induced both (38.Sillence D.J. Allen D. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Again, these results suggest that Fas-induced apoptosis and Fas-induced ceramide production can be separable events in lymphoid cells. Signaling via aSMase and/or ceramide may be critically important for apoptosis in other systems. In radiation-induced apoptosis, a critical role for ceramide production was demonstrated (49.Haimovitz-Friedman A. Khan C.C. Ehleiter D. Persaud R.S. McLoughlin M. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 525-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar, 50.Santana P PenÃÉa L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z.

Similar results were recently obtained for microvessal endothelium throughout the central nervous system (51.PenÃÉa, L. A., Fuks, Z., and Kolesnick, R. N. (2000) Cancer Res., in pressGoogle Scholar). In contrast, thymocytes from aSMase‚àí/‚àí animals readily undergo radiation-induced cell death. Animals lacking p53 show the opposite pattern; thymocytes are resistant to radiation, whereas the lung cells remain fully susceptible (50.Santana P PenÃÉa L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S.

https://openalex.org/W2169294522,"Influenza A viruses are capable of inducing the expression of a variety of cytokine and proapoptotic genes in infected cells. The promoter regions of most of these genes harbor binding sites for the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B which is an important mediator of immune and inflammatory responses. Our present study is based on an observation that influenza A virus infection of cells stimulates transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) which harbors two regulatory NF-Œ∫B elements, and is aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in this process. We found that the expression of influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), matrix protein (M), and nucleoprotein (NP), as single factors is sufficient to transcriptionally activate the HIV-1 LTR. This process is mediated by oxidative radicals because treatment of cells with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a scavenger of such radicals, abolished the transactivating ability. Expression of different influenza proteins induces activation of NF-Œ∫B-dependent gene expression but not transcriptional activation of an AP-1/Ets-dependent promoter, indicating a selectivity for NF-Œ∫B transactivation. Furthermore, influenza protein expression induces activation of IŒ∫B kinase (IKK). Accordingly coexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant of IKK abolishes influenza protein induced activation of NF-Œ∫B as well as HIV-1 LTR-dependent reporter gene expression, suggesting that IKK is an important intermediate within this signaling process.

Segments 4 and 6 code for the two integral membrane glycoproteins of the virus, hemagglutinin (HA),1 and neuramindase, respectively. The most abundant structural proteins of the virus particle are the products of RNA segment 5 and 7, the nucleoprotein (NP) and the matrix protein (M), respectively, both of which were found to be post-translationally phosphorylated at least in some virus strains.

Virol. 1991; 116: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The limited genetic information of the virus genome requires multifunctionality of most viral proteins and these additional functions may include yet undetected activities toward cellular factors. Although only little is known about the intracellular signaling pathways which are activated after influenza virus infection, there are numerous reports on downstream target genes which are deregulated upon infection, both in cells which are permissive or non-permissive for viral replication. This includes genes encoding interleukins (IL), tumor necrosis factor Œ± (TNFŒ±), and interferons, but also chemokine genes, proapoptotic genes, and adhesion molecule genes (reviewed in Ref. 7.Ludwig S. Pleschka S. Wolff T. Viral Immunol. 1999; 12: 175-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Remarkably, most of the influenza virus responsive cytokine, chemokine, or adhesion molecule genes that are up-regulated in response to influenza virus infection harbor binding sites for the transcription factor NF-Œ∫B in their promoter regions. The transcription factor NF-Œ∫B is a rapidly induced host cell factor and a pleiotropic mediator of immune and inflammatory responses (reviewed in Refs. 8.Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4598) Google Scholar and 9.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). In most cell types, NF-Œ∫B is sequestered in an inactive, cytoplasmic complex by binding to IŒ∫B, an inhibitory subunit (reviewed in Ref. 10.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5578) Google Scholar). Exposure of cells to a wide variety of pathological stimuli such as viral or bacterial infections, inflammatory cytokines, or UV irradiation leads to activation of NF-Œ∫B through the phosphorylation of IŒ∫B. This phosphorylation event is at least in the case of TNFŒ±, IL-1, and HTLV-1 Tax protein-induced NF-Œ∫B activation mediated by the recently identified IŒ∫B kinases (IKK) (reviewed in Ref. 11.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Following translocation to the nucleus, NF-Œ∫B activates transcription of a large variety of genes including those of cytokines, hematopoietic growth factors, cell-adhesion molecules, and promoter regulatory regions of human pathogenic viruses (12.Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). NF-Œ∫B activation is induced by viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2, human T cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1), hepatitis B virus, herpes simplex virus type-1, and influenza virus (8.Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4598) Google Scholar, 13.Grilli M. Chiu J.J.-S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev.

However, the detailed molecular mechanism and viral components underlying this induction remains unclear. In several cases the expression of a single viral protein is sufficient to activate NF-Œ∫B, as seen with Tax from HTLV-1 (15.Schreck R. Grassmann R. Fleckenstein B. Baeuerle P.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6288-6293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), E3/19k from adenovirus (16.Pahl H.L. Sester M. Burgert H.G. Baeuerle P.A. J.

In addition, it was reported that the HA from a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus transactivates NF-Œ∫B via an ER-overload mechanism (19.Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. J.

The HIV-1 LTR harbors two NF-Œ∫B regulatory binding sites in the modulatory promoter region (see Fig. 1 A). These duplicated Œ∫B sequences are preserved in clinical HIV-1 isolates as well as in tissue culture-adapted virus strains. The activity of the Œ∫B element is achieved by up-regulating the levels of binding of NF-Œ∫B to its consensus sites and a persistent activation of NF-Œ∫B is observed during HIV-1 infection (26.Jacque J.M. Fernandez B. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. Thomas D. Baleux F. Virelizier J.L. Bachelerie F. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2930-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our study is based on the observation that influenza A virus infection of cells leads to transactivation of the HIV-LTR. Our objective was to study the molecular mechansim by analyzing the transactivating effects of influenza viral components using a HIV-1 LTR-reporter gene construct as a molecular read out for NF-Œ∫B dependent T cell-specific gene expression. We show that expression of different structural influenza viral proteins, when acting as single factors, is sufficient to lead to antioxidant-sensitive stimulation of HIV-1 gene expression via an NF-Œ∫B inducing mechanism involving the recently described IKK. This mechanism is likely to account for influenza virus-induced gene expression in cells which are not permissive for viral replication, such as T lymphocytes.

For SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 10% gels were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose BAS-85 membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and analyzed by Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, the membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBST)) and washed in TBST as described by Flory et al.(24.Flory E. Hoffmeyer A. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Bruder J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a secondary antibody, protein A-peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used, followed by standard enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. The 3xŒ∫B-tk luciferase plasmid contains three tandem copies of the Œ∫B motif cloned upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter reporter gene. This plasmid as well as pcDNA-VSV-IKKŒ≤ and kinase-inactive pcDNA-IKKŒ≤ (IKKŒ≤-KD) were obtained from T. Wirth, University of Wuerzburg.

Pleschka, Institut fuÃàr Molekularbiologie und Mikrobiologie, Giessen, Germany. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and infected with a multiplicity of infection of 2 or 10 plaque forming units/cell. Cells were incubated with a virus dilution in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine albumin for 30 min at 37 ¬∞C. Virus dilutions were removed and cells were incubated for 4 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.2% bovine albumin. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, culture supernatants were collected 24‚Äì120 h post-transfection and stored at ‚àí70 ¬∞C. HIV-1 p24 antigen in culture supernatant was detected using the Abbott Laboratories HIVAG-1 enzyme immunoassay according to the manufacturer's protocol. The p24 concentration (pg/ml) was calculated according to the Abbott Laboratories Quantification enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The cutoff value was A 420 nm = 0.063, which represents 240 pg/ml p24. Human A3.01 T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine, streptomycin, and penicillin. The human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For transfection of HEK293 cells 5 √ó 105 cells were seeded in a 10-cm diameter dish and grown 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum prior to transfection. Transfections were performed by a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method using 5‚Äì10 Œºg of DNA unless otherwise indicated, according to a modified Stratagene transfection protocol (24.Flory E. Hoffmeyer A. Smola U. Rapp U.R. Bruder J.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2260-2268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A3.01 T cells were cultured routinely to a density of 0.5 to 1.0 √ó 106cells/ml. Briefly, cells (5 √ó 105 per 6-well dish) were transfected using DMRIE reagent with 0.5‚Äì2.0 Œºg of expression vectors according to a modified transfection procedure from Life Technologies, Inc. For luciferase assays, T cells were transfected with combinations of 0.4 Œºg of reporter constructs, 2.0 Œºg of pRSPA expression constructs or empty vector, 0.1‚Äì0.5 Œºg of pCDNA-IKK (wt and mutants), 0.05 Œºg of HIV molecular luciferase clone. The cells were incubated for 5 h in an incubator at 37 ¬∞C, 7.5% CO2 in the presence of the DMRIE-nucleic acid complexes. Then 1.5-ml growth medium was added. For luciferase assays, total cell extracts were prepared 24‚Äì42 h later. Briefly, cells of each well were harvested in 100 Œºl of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium-MES, pH 7.8, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 2% Triton X-100). The crude cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation and 50 Œºl of precleared cell extracts were added to 50 Œºl of luciferase assay buffer (125 mm sodium-MES, pH 7.8, 25 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mg/ml ATP) and activity was measured after injection of 50 Œºl of 1 mmd-luciferin (AppliChem) in a Berthold Lumat luminometer. Total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford technique (Bio-Rad). Results are presented as luciferase units normalized to protein concentration and mock transfection with corresponding empty expression vectors. Mean and standard deviations of at least three independent experiments each done in duplicate or triplicate are shown in the figures. A3.01 T cells were transiently co-transfected with a DNA construct expressing a VSV-tagged form of IKKŒ≤ wt and expression plasmids for different influenza and Sendai viral proteins. Cells were lysed in TLB buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium Œ≤-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 137 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 Œºg/ml aprotinin, 5 Œºg/ml leupeptin) on ice for 30 min. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants were then incubated with 1 Œºg/ml of an anti-VSV mab (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at 4 ¬∞C. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-agarose, washed once with high-salt TLB buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium Œ≤-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Pefabloc, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm benzamidine, 5 Œºg/ml aprotinin, 5 Œºg/ml leupeptin) and twice with kinase buffer (10 mmMgCl2, 25 mm Œ≤-glycerophosphate, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm benzamidine, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) supplemented with 3 m urea. After two final washing steps in kinase buffer immunoprecipitates were assayed in the same buffer supplemented with 5 ŒºCi of [Œ≥-32P]ATP, 0.1 mm ATP, and 1 Œºg of recombinant GST-IŒ∫BŒ± as a substrate protein at 30 ¬∞C for 30 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and detected by x-ray film exposure or by a Bio Imaging Analyzer BAS 2000 (Fuji). Equal loading of VSV-IKKŒ≤ was controlled by Western blotting using the anti-VSV monoclonal antibody. To assess whether infection with influenza A virus may transactivate the HIV-1 LTR, transient transfection experiments using an HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase gene were performed (Fig.1 A). Human HEK293 cells were transfected with this reporter constructs and 24 h after transfection subsequently infected with influenza A virus at a multiplicity of infection of 2 and 10. To avoid the influence of influenza virus-induced cytokine expression we used an incubation time of 4 h. Influenza virus infection of cells efficiently transactivates the HIV-LTR as early as 4 h after infection (Fig.1 B). This effect was dependent on the multiplicity of infection, and was similar in intensity to that induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) treatment of cells, an agent which stimulates HIV-1 gene expression. These results indicate that infection of cells with influenza virus activates intracellular signaling pathways, and leads to enhancement of HIV-1 LTR-dependent transcription. Since it is known from other viruses that expression of a single viral protein is sufficient to induce gene expression, we next investigated whether structural influenza proteins may have a similar transactivating capacity. To assess whether influenza virus protein expression itself is sufficient for HIV-1 LTR-dependent transcription we coexpressed influenza virus NP, M, or HA proteins from the same constitutive promoter. Fig.2 shows that individual expression of these proteins induces transcription of the HIV-LTR from 3‚Äì10-fold. TPA treatment of cells was used as a positive control and showed a 7-fold stimulation of the HIV-1 promoter. In contrast, mock transfected cells or cells transfected with the HN protein from Sendai virus, which is a viral surface glycoprotein similar to the influenza HA, did not transactivate the HIV-LTR (Fig. 2). The generation of oxidative radicals is an important step in the regulation of HIV-1 gene expression (34.Israel N. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 864-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine whether influenza protein-induced HIV-1 transactivation is dependent on such radicals, we used the scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). Incubation of cells with 60 Œºm PDTC has no effect in mock or Sendai-HN transfected cells (Fig. 2, white bars). However, TPA-induced as well as HA, M, and NP induced HIV-1 promoter activation is substantially inhibited by this antioxidant. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that expression of various influenza proteins transactivates the HIV-LTR, and that the mechansim of this activation involves the generation of oxidative radicals. The radical scavenger PDTC is a known inhibitor of NF-Œ∫B (15.Schreck R. Grassmann R. Fleckenstein B. Baeuerle P.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 6288-6293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a transcription factor which is essential for HIV-1 gene expression. We performed transient transfection experiments using expression vectors for influenza proteins and a Œ∫B-dependent luciferase reporter gene to investigate whether influenza protein expression stimulates NF-Œ∫B activation. TPA treatment of cells induced a Œ∫B-dependent luciferase activity about 12-fold (Fig. 3,black bars). NF-Œ∫B activation is not induced in mock transfected cells or in cells transfected with structural surface HN protein from Sendai virus. Consistent with previous published data (19.Pahl H.L. Baeuerle P.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1480-1484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,35.Baumann B. Kistler B. Kirillov A. Bergman Y. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11448-11455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), expression of influenza-HA stimulates Œ∫B-dependent transcription about 10-fold. As observed with the HIV-LTR, other structural viral proteins such as NP and the M protein also induce transcriptional activation of the Œ∫B-dependent reporter gene 3‚Äì18-fold over mock transfected cells, suggesting that these proteins mediate NF-Œ∫B activation. To rule out that the observed effect is simply a result of protein overexpression that for some reason does not occur with Sendai virus HN we expressed other proteins such as the green fluorescence protein or an active mutant of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase MKK6 (MKK6EE). Green fluorescence protein was chosen as an irrelevant protein with no signaling capacity, whereas MKK6EE has a known transactivating feature toward various promoters (30.Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 36.Hoffmeyer A. Grosse-Wilde A. Flory E. Neufeld B. Kunz M. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4319-4327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) including the AP-1 and Ets-dependent promoter used below. However, we did not observe a transcriptional activation of the Œ∫B-dependent promoter in the presence of green fluorescence protein or MKK6(EE), indicating that the influenza virus protein-induced transactivation is not specifically caused by protein accumulation (data not shown). Similar to our observation with the HIV-LTR, incubation of cells with PDTC substantially inhibited NF-Œ∫B activation induced by TPA as well as HA and M protein expression (Fig. 3, white bars). Interestingly, PDTC was not as effective on NP induced activity. These findings demonstrate that expression of influenza proteins leads to activation of Œ∫B-dependent transcription and that the mechanism is likely to involve the generation of oxidative radicals as critical signaling intermediates. We next determined whether influenza proteins stimulate signaling pathways leading to activation of other promoters such as AP-1/Ets responsive elements of immediate-early genes. In transient transfection experiments using an AP-1/Ets-dependent luciferase reporter, gene expression could be induced about 17-fold by treatment of cells with TPA and by about 34-fold by overexpression of active Raf-kinase (Fig. 4), which is in accordance with previously published data (32.Bruder J.T. Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In contrast, no significant transcriptional activation of this reporter was observed after expression of different influenza proteins. These data suggest that there is a certain transactivational selectivity of these proteins toward the NF-Œ∫B transcription factor. NF-Œ∫B activation is controlled by inhibitory proteins of the IŒ∫B family (8.Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4598) Google Scholar, 13.Grilli M. Chiu J.J.-S. Lenardo M.J. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 143: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). These proteins are phosphorylated by IKK and it has been shown that these kinases are critical mediators in IL-1, TNF, and HTLV-1 Tax protein-induced activation of NF-Œ∫B (11.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Thus, we analyzed whether influenza proteins are also capable to induce IKK activity. A3.01 T cells were co-transfected with empty vector or DNA constructs expressing influenza virus NP, M, HA, or Sendai virus HN protein together with a plasmid expressing a VSV-tagged form of IKKŒ≤. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-VSV antibody and immune complexes were subsequently assayed in an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant GST-IŒ∫BŒ± as a substrate. Consistent with the NF-Œ∫B transactivation data (Fig. 3) coexpression of empty vector or Sendai virus NH protein has no effect on VSV-IKKŒ≤ activity, however, in the presence of influenza virus NP, M, and HA proteins VSV-IKKŒ≤ activity is significantly induced as measured by an increased phosphorylation of GST-IŒ∫BŒ± (Fig. 5). To assess whether IKK activation plays a functional role in influenza protein-induced NF-Œ∫B dependent gene expression we coexpressed kinase inactive versions of both IKKŒ± and -Œ≤. These mutants act as dominant negative forms over their cellular counterparts. Fig. 6 Ashows that TPA induced NF-Œ∫B activation was significantly inhibited by co-expression of a kinase-dead mutant of IKKŒ≤ (IKKŒ≤-KD), but, suprisingly, not by a dominant negative mutant of IKKŒ± (IKKŒ±-KD). High amounts of IKKŒ≤-KD but not of IKKŒ±-KD act very efficiently and even inhibit basal NF-Œ∫B activity. To analyze the induced promoter activity a semi-inhibiting concentration of kinase-dead IKKŒ≤ resulting in a 50‚Äì60% inhibition of TPA-induced NF-Œ∫B activation was chosen for the following experiments. As seen after stimulation of cells with TPA, NF-Œ∫B activation induced by expression of HA, M, and NP was inhibited by co-e"

In the present study, we addressed whether carbohydrate binding activity is required for the ECA activity of ecalectin and whether both CRDs are essential for this activity. Recombinant full-length wild-type ecalectin (ecalectin-WT) and N-terminal and C-terminal CRD (ecalectin-NT and -CT, respectively) were generated. All of these recombinant proteins exhibited affinity for lactose, a property shared by galectins, but ecalectin-WT exhibited substantially higher hemagglutination activities than ecalectin-NT and -CT. Furthermore, ecalectin-WT showed over 100-fold higher ECA activity than ecalectin-NT and -CT; combination of recombinant domain fragments did not reconstitute the ECA and hemagglutination activities of the full-length protein. ECA activity of ecalectin-WT was inhibited by lactose in a dose-dependent manner. Site-directed mutation of positions Arg65 of ecalectin-NT and Arg239 of ecalectin-CT to an aspartic acid residue resulted in the loss of both lactose-binding and ECA activities.

Human galectin-9 was first cloned from a cDNA library derived from the disease-involved spleen of a patient with a nodular sclerosis type of Hodgkin's disease (25.Tuereci O. Schmitt H. Fadle N. Pfreundscuh M. Sahin U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6416-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The clone was identified by immunoscreening with autologous serum, suggesting that the patient had developed autoantibodies to this protein. Previously, these investigators have shown that autoantibodies reactive to galectin-9 were detectable in the sera from 10 of 18 patients with Hodgkin's disease (26.Sahin U. Tuereci O. Schmitt H. Cochlovius B. Johanes T. Schmits R. Luo Schobert I. Pfreundscuh M. FSGProc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11810-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that galectin-9 expression is restricted to peripheral blood leukocytes and lymphatic tissues (25.Tuereci O. Schmitt H. Fadle N. Pfreundscuh M. Sahin U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6416-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Murine galectin-9 has also been cloned, and the protein was found to be expressed by thymic epithelial cells, among other tissues, and to cause apoptosis of murine thymocytes in vitro, suggesting a possible role in T cell ontogeny in the thymus (24.Wada J. Kanwar Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6078-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 28.Wada J. Ota K. Kumar A. Wallner E.I. Kanwar Y.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2452-2461Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Our recent finding revealed an important function of galectin-9; we found that a T-cell line-derived ECA (termed ecalectin) has a nearly identical amino acid sequence to galectin-9 (differing only in 5 amino acids); recombinant ecalectin has potent ECA activity, as demonstrated bothin vitro and in vivo; the corresponding mRNA is highly induced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients allergic to mites when the cells are treated with a mite allergenin vitro (9.Matsumoto R.

These findings have provided a possible explanation for the accumulation of eosinophils in lymphatic tissues involved in Hodgkin's disease. Furthermore, they have suggested that ecalectin may play an important role in recruiting eosinophils in allergic inflammation. The mechanism underlying ecalectin's ECA activity remains to be elucidated. In this study, we generated recombinant ecalectin and its N- and C-terminal CRDs to determine the role of each domain in this activity. We also addressed whether the ECA activity is dependent on lectin-carbohydrate interactions by testing the inhibition of the activity by lactose, which is a saccharide ligand recognized by galectins, and by studying ecalectin mutants lacking the lectin activity. We demonstrate that ecalectin's bivalent carbohydrate binding property is essential for its ECA activity. Nonidet-P40, 2-mercaptoethanol, Tris-HCl, Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, SDS, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. The following forward (S) and reverse (AS) primers were used to amplify cDNAs for galectin-1, -3, and -8; ecalectin; and ecalectin-NT and -CT from plasmids containing the respective cDNA: galectin-1-S (5-CCCGGATCCATGGCTTGTGGTCTGGTC), galectin-1-AS (5-CCCCTCGAGTCAGTCAAAGGCCACACA), galectin-3-S (5-CCCGAATTCCCATGGCAGACAATTTTTCG), galectin-3-AS (5-CCCCTCGAGTTATATCATGGTATATGAAG), galectin-8-S (5-CGTCCTAGATCTATGATGTTGTCCTTAAACAAC), galectin-8-AS (5-CGACCGGGTACCCTACCAGCTCCTTACTTCCAG), ecalectin-WT-S (5-CCCGAATTCCCATGGCCTTCAGCAGTTCC), ecalectin-WT-AS (5-CCCCTCGAGCTATGTCTGCACATGGGT), ecalectin-NT-S (5-CCCGAATTCCCATGGCCTTCAGCAGTTCC), ecalectin-NT-AS (5-CCCCTCGAGTCATGTGTGGATGACTGTCTG), ecalectin-CT-S (5-CCCGAATTCCCATTACCCAGAGAGTCATC), ecalectin-CT-AS (5-CCCCTCGAGCTATGTCTGCACATGGGT). Expression vectors were constructed by inserting cDNAs into theBglII/KpnI site of pTrcHisB (galectin-8; Invitrogen) or BamHI/XhoI site (galectin-1) orEcoRI/XhoI site (others) of pGEX-4T-2 (a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion vector; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following S and AS primers were used to generate cDNAs for site-directed mutants of ecalectin-NT and -CT: NT-R65D-S (5-CCCTGACTTTGAAGATGGAGGG), NT-R65D-AS (5-CAAAGTCAGGGTTGAAGTGGAA), CT-R239D-S (5-CACCTGAACCCCGACTTTGATGAGAAT), and CT-R239D-AS (5-ATTCTCATCAAAGTCGGGGTTCAGGTG). Site-directed mutagenesis of ecalectin-NT residue Arg65 to Asp was carried out as follows. In two separate reactions, cDNA fragments upstream and downstream of the point mutation were amplified using ecalectin-NT-S plus NT-R65D-AS and NT-R65D-S plus ecalectin-NT-AS. The amplified fragments were then mixed and subjected to a second round of PCR using ecalectin-NT-S plus ecalectin-NT-AS to generate full-length cDNA. The cDNA carrying a point mutation was inserted into the EcoRI/XhoI site of pGEX-4T-2. Site-directed mutagenesis to generate ecalectin-CT-R239D was carried out using a Quickchange Kit (Stratagene) and CT-R239D-S and CT-R239D-AS according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli BL-21 cells carrying each expression plasmid were grown in 2√ó YT medium supplemented with 10% (w/v) glucose and 100 Œºg/ml ampicillin to an optical density of 0.7 at 600 nm. The expression of fusion proteins was induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-Œ≤-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were continued for 6 h at 30 ¬∞C (ecalectin-WT, ecalectin-NT, and ecalectin-NT-R239D) or for 2 h at 37 ¬∞C (galectin-1, -3, and -8; ecalectin-CT; and ecalectin-CT-R239D). The cell pellet obtained from a 1-liter culture was suspended in 100 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then sonicated for 4 min. The sonicate was supplemented with 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and then stirred for 30 min at 4 ¬∞C, followed by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was subjected to affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The affinity-purified fusion proteins were digested with thrombin, and the released ecalectin and galectins were purified by lactose-agarose affinity chromatography (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan). To purify galectin-8, E. coli extract was directly subjected to lactose-agarose affinity chromatography. In the case of site-directed mutants, which lack affinity for lactose (see ‚ÄúResults‚Äù), the GST moiety was removed from the thrombin digest with glutathione-Sepharose. Protein concentration was determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. ECA activity was evaluated in vitro as described previously (8.Hirashima M. Ueno M. Higuchi S. Matsumoto T. Sakata K. Matsumoto R. Adachi M. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1992; 11: 331-338PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Matsumoto R. Matsumoto H. Seki M. Hata M. Asano Y. Kanegasaki S. Stevens R.L. Hirashima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16976-16984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In brief, CD16-negative eosinophils were enriched by subjecting peripheral blood leukocytes from healthy volunteers to a discontinuous density gradient of Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by immunomagnetic treatment of the cells with anti-CD16 immunoglobulin (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). The purity and viability of the purified eosinophils were >97 and >95%, respectively. ECA activity was evaluated using a 48-well chamber (Neuro Probe Inc.) containing a polyvinylpyrrolidone-free membrane with 5-Œºm pore sizes. Human eosinophils (0.5‚Äì1 √ó 106/ml) and varied concentrations of a test chemoattractant were placed in the top and bottom chambers, respectively. Each assay was performed in triplicate. After a 1‚Äì2-h incubation at 37 ¬∞C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, the membrane separating the two chambers was removed and placed in Diff-Quick stain (Baxter Healthcare Corp.). Stained eosinophils were counted under a microscope. Human eotaxin-1 (Seikagaku Corp.) was used as a control. Hemagglutination activity was assessed by the method of Nowak et al. (29.Nowak T.P. Haywood P.L. Barondes S.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 68: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Briefly, assay samples were prepared by serial 2-fold dilutions of recombinant proteins in a 96-well microtiter plate. After the addition of bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde-fixed trypsin-treated rabbit erythrocytes to a final concentration of 0.25% (w/v) and 1% (v/v), respectively, the reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The minimum concentration required for hemagglutination was visually determined. Ecalectin has previously been shown to have affinity for Œ≤-galactosides and to be a selective eosinophil chemoattractant (9.Matsumoto R. Matsumoto H. Seki M. Hata M. Asano Y. Kanegasaki S. Stevens R.L. Hirashima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16976-16984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In order to examine the structure-function relationships of ecalectin, we produced three types of ecalectin: ecalectin-WT, ecalectin-NT, and ecalectin-CT (Fig.1 A). GST-ecalectin-WT, -NT, and -CT were expressed in E. coli BL21 and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography followed by lactose affinity chromatography. After cleavage of glutathione by thrombin, GST-free ecalectin and domain fragments were purified by lactose affinity chromatography (Fig. 1 B). In the affinity purification of ecalectin and derivatives, the proteins bound to lactose-agarose were eluted with a gradient of lactose (0‚Äì200 mm). We found that all of the ecalectin preparations (with or without the GST moiety) were eluted at 20‚Äì23 mm lactose, suggesting that they have similar affinity for lactose. Since the recovery of ecalectin-WT after thrombin digestion was low, we compared ECA activity between GST-containing and GST-cleaved preparations to clarify whether the GST moiety affects ECA activity of ecalectin-WT, -NT, and -CT. We failed to detect any difference in ECA activity between GST-containing ecalectin and GST-cleaved ecalectin at any concentration tested (Fig. 2). Therefore, we used GST-containing ecalectin-WT, -NT, and -CT for further analysis. Ecalectin-WT, -NT, -CT exhibited ECA activity in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig.3). ECA activity of ecalectin-WT at 1 √ó 10‚àí7m was similar to that of eotaxin-1, a potent chemoattractant specific for eosinophils, at 1 √ó 10‚àí7m. In contrast, ecalectin-NT and -CT and galectin-8 did not exhibit evident ECA activity at 1 √ó 10‚àí7m (Fig. 3). They exhibited apparent ECA activity at 1‚Äì3 √ó 10‚àí6m, although the activity was about two-thirds of that of ecalectin-WT (Fig. 3). In contrast, galectin-1 and -3, which have one CRD, failed to exhibit detectable ECA activity even at 3 √ó 10‚àí6m (Fig. 3). We also tested the ECA activity of a mixture of ecalectin-NT and -CT at 1 √ó 10‚àí7m, and the results showed that the ECA activity of ecalectin was not reconstituted by the combination of isolated individual domains. In addition, we found that the ECA activity of ecalectin-WT was not affected by the presence of equal amounts of ecalectin-NT and -CT (Fig.4). Galectin-1 and -3 also had no effect on ECA activity of ecalectin-WT (Fig. 4). Next, experiments were done to clarify whether lactose could inhibit the ECA activity of ecalectin-WT. ECA activity of ecalectin-WT was inhibited by lactose in a dose-dependent manner, while sucrose at 20 mm failed to inhibit ECA activity. ECA activity of ecalectin-WT was inhibited almost completely by 20 mm lactose, whereas that of eotaxin-1 was barely inhibited (Fig. 5). One of the characteristics of galectins is their hemagglutination activity, which is attributable to their bivalent carbohydrate-binding property. In the case of galectins with two CRDs, the bivalency is probably due to carbohydrate binding manifested by each domain. Therefore, hemagglutination activity of recombinant ecalectin and domain fragments was assessed and compared with galectin-1. As shown in TableI, the minimum concentration of ecalectin-WT required for the hemagglutination was 0.0125 Œºm, which was comparable with that for galectin-1 (0.025 Œºm). Ecalectin-NT and -CT also exhibited hemagglutination activity, although the activity was clearly lower than that of ecalectin-WT (Table I). The results also showed that the presence of the GST moiety had no effect on the activity.Table IHemagglutination activity of ecalectin-WT, -NT, and -CT and galectin-1 and -8Recombinant proteinsMinimum concentration for hemagglutinationŒºmGST-ecalectin-WT/(ecalectin-WT)0.0125/(0.0125)GST-ecalectin-NT/(ecalectin-NT)0.2/(0.2)GST-ecalectin-NT-R65DNDaND, not detected.GST-ecalectin-CT/(ecalectin-CT)0.2/(0.2)GST-ecalectin-CT-R239DNDGST-galectin-10.025GST aloneNDGalectin-80.0084Minimal concentrations necessary for hemagglutination activity of GST-containing and -cleaved ecalectin-WT, -NT, and -CT are shown.a ND, not detected.

Recent crystal structure studies of galectins suggest that the amino acids directly interacting with the bound carbohydrate are highly conserved among members of the galectin family. Highly conserved residues His158, Asn160, and Arg162 of galectin-3 may play a central role in binding (30.Lobsanov Y.D. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Rini J.M. Biol.

We therefore focused on Arg65 in the N-terminal CRD and Arg239 in the C-terminal CRD of ecalectin, which correspond to Arg162 of galectin-3. We generated site-directed mutants of ecalectin-NT and -CT, ecalectin-NT-R65D and ecalectin-CT-R239D, both as GST fusion proteins. GST-ecalectin-NT-R65D and GST-ecalectin-CT-R239D were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The purified mutants failed to bind to lactose-agarose beads, suggesting that they do not posses lactose-binding activity (Fig. 6). GST-ecalectin-NT-R65D and GST-ecalectin-CT-R239D exhibited negligible hemagglutination activity (Table I), indicating that the two Arg residues are indispensable for carbohydrate recognition by ecalectin. As shown in Fig. 7, both GST-ecalectin-NT-R65D and GST-ecalectin-CT-R239D also failed to exhibit detectable ECA activity even at 3 √ó 10‚àí6m.Figure 7Comparison of ECA activity of site-directed mutants and their parental proteins. a, ECA activities of ecalectin-NT (‚óè) and ecalectin-NT-R65D (‚óã) were assessed.b, those of ecalectin-CT (‚óè) and ecalectin-CT-R239D (‚óã) were assessed.

Seki M. Hata M. Asano Y. Kanegasaki S. Stevens R.L. Hirashima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16976-16984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), we demonstrated that ecalectin is a potent and selective eosinophil chemoattractant. We noted previously that ecalectin represents a variant form of human galectin-9, because there are as many as five amino acids that are different between the two proteins (9.Matsumoto R.

Subsequently, we generated ecalectin cDNA from a human T-cell line, Jurkat, by reverse transcriptase-PCR using oligonucleotide primers that correspond to internal sequences of ecalectin. DNA sequencing revealed that all of the 12 independent clones share a common sequence, and the deduced protein sequence differs from our previously published ecalectin sequence (9.Matsumoto R.

Pfreundscuh M. Sahin U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6416-6422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) by 4 amino acids (Table II). In the meantime, we found over 17 EST clones in the data base for which partial sequences are available. The amino acids for positions 5, 88, 135, and 238 are known for some of them, and they are invariably Gly, Lys, Ser, and Pro, respectively, and are identical to the Jurkat sequence (Table II). We know that Jurkat cells express ecalectin, because the cell supernatant contains ECA that is absorbable by lactose-agarose and anti-ecalectin antibodies (data not shown). Therefore, the Ser to Gly substitution at position 5 does not affect the eosinophil chemoattractant activity. The fact that none of the EST clones has amino acids at positions 88, 135, and 238 that match those originally described for galectin-9 suggests that the latter probably contains sequences that are a result of allelic variation, mutation, and/or cloning/sequencing artifacts. Therefore, in our view galectin-9 is ecalectin, and eosinophil chemoattractant activity is a function of galectin-9.Table IIAmino acids at positions 5, 88, 135, 238, and 281 in galectin-9 ESTPositions588135238281Sequence correctedggtaagtcccccgaa(G)(K)(S)(P)(E)Ecalectin-a-‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî(S)(K)(S)(P)(E)Gal-9‚Äî-g--t--t--g-(G)(R)(F)(L)(G)EST clones (source) AA428401 (ovary tumor)‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî(G)(K)(S) AA476845 (ovary tumor)‚Äî‚Äî(G)(K) AA443641 (ovary tumor)‚Äî‚Äî(K)(S) AA448365 (ovary tumor)‚Äî(E) AA477070(ovary tumor)‚Äî(P) AA353933(Jurkat T-cell)‚Äî‚Äî(G)(K) AA354210 (Jurkat T-cell)‚Äî‚Äî(G)(K) AA354814 (Jurkat T-cell)‚Äî(P) AA382104(Activated T-cell)‚Äî(G) AA394654 (B-cell leukemia)‚Äî‚Äî(G)(K) AA295169 (pancreas tumor)‚Äî(K) AA295767 (pancreas tumor)‚Äî(K) AA825886 (colon tumor)‚Äî(E) AA829906 (lung tumor)‚Äî(E) AA810306(tonsil)‚Äî‚Äî(G)(K) AA484985(tonsil)‚Äî(K) AA89534 (liver and spleen)‚Äî(P)These putative galectin-9 EST clones were identified by BLAST sequence search (27.Altschul S.F.

The EST clones from different sources are demonstrated without Gly (G), Lys (K), Ser (S), Pro (P), and Glu (E) at positions 5, 88, 135, 238, and 281, respectively. In the present study, we further confirmed this particular characteristic of ecalectin by demonstrating ECA activity of recombinant ecalectin-WT, which is manifested in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3). As a novel observation, we found that both N- and C-terminal CRD exhibited ECA activity, but the activity was substantially lower than full-length ecalectin (Fig. 3), suggesting that the two CRDs need to be covalently linked for full ECA activity of ecalectin. The requirement of both domains for full activity is also reflected in hemagglutination induced by this protein. Thus, ecalectin-WT exhibited high hemagglutination activity comparable with that of galectin-1, whereas ecalectin-NT and -CT exhibited over 10-fold lower hemagglutination activity. Because each CRD contains only one carbohydrate-binding site, the hemagglutination activity exhibited by ecalectin-NT and -CT suggest that these CRDs may exist as dimers and/or multimers. This is different from the case of a 32-kDa galectin isolated from the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans, which is also composed of two homologous domains. While the full-length protein exhibits hemagglutination activity, the N- and C-terminal CRDs of the protein fail to exhibit evident hemagglutination activity even at the concentration of 100 Œºg/ml. Gel permeation chromatography of these domain fragments showed that they do not form dimer (32.Arata Y. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1002-10009Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, galectin-1 contains one CRD but exists as noncovalently linked homodimers. However, ecalectin-NT and -CT clearly have lower hemagglutination activity than galectin-1, suggesting that they may not form stable dimers and/or multimers. The findings that ECA activity of ecalectin is inhibitable by lactose and that mutated domains lacking carbohydrate binding activity do not exhibit ECA activity suggest that galactoside-binding activity is critically involved in ecalectin's ECA activity (Figs. 6 and 7). Based on these findings, we postulate that ecalectin functions by cross-linking galactoside-containing glycoprotein molecules on the surface of eosinophils, resulting in eosinophil chemoattraction. The fact that both ecalectin-NT and -CT retain partial ECA activity suggests that both domains contribute to the activity of ecalectin by binding to the appropriate cell surface glycoconjugates. Two possibilities exist: 1) the two domains bind to two distinct glycoproteins, and thus ecalectin functions by cross-linking these two different glycoprotein species; and 2) the two domains bind to different oligosaccharide moieties on the same glycoprotein, and thus ecalectin functions by cross-linking the same glycoprotein species. The finding that ecalectin-NT and -CT at 10‚àí7m do not affect ECA activity of ecalectin at the same concentration (Fig. 4) is consistent with the fact that the domains individually or in combination do not exhibit ECA activity at this concentration, although they are active at higher concentrations, e.g.10‚àí6m (Figs. 3 and 4). The results suggest that the domains are not as effective as the full-length protein in binding to and/or cross-linking the relevant cell surface receptor(s). We found that ecalectin-NT or -CT at 10‚àí6mhas an additive effect, rather than an inhibitory effect, on ECA activity of ecalectin at the same concentration (data not shown). The results suggest that binding sites for each domain on the cell surface are at such high densities that binding by ecalectin and the domains is not mutually exclusive at the concentration being studied (i.e. 10‚àí6m). The possibility that the isolated domains bind to different glycoconjugates than the ones recognized by the full-length protein is also consistent with the data, but it is less likely. The receptor for ecalectin that mediates the observed ECA of this lectin is presently unknown. There are a number of proteins in the C-, CC-, or CXC-chemokine families that have been identified to be eosinophil chemoattractants (33.Kita H. Gleich GL. J. Exp.

However, an interesting possibility exists that its ECA activity is also mediated through these chemokine receptors, which may be recognized by ecalectin via lectin-carbohydrate interaction (39.Imai T.

Although galectins are defined by their affinity for galactoside, in addition to their sharing of a consensus sequence, it is likely that different galectins have different fine carbohydrate specificity (42.Feizi T.

Therefore, it is expected that each galectin recognizes different glycoproteins on surfaces of various cells and thus has different effects on the cell. Indeed, we found that ECA appears to be unique to ecalectin and is not exhibited by galectin-1 and -3 (Fig. 3). Also, ECA activity of ecalectin is not inhibitable by galectin-1 and -3 (Fig. 4), suggesting that the receptor for ecalectin is not recognized by these other two galectins. ECA activity of galectin-8 was less than 10% of that of ecalectin-WT but was comparable with those of ecalectin-NT and -CT at concentrations of 1‚Äì3 √ó 10‚àí6m. It is possible that galectin-8 does not bind to any glycoprotein that effectively transmits chemoattractant activity or that it recognizes the same receptor as ecalectin does but does not engage it as effectively. It is notable also that while ecalectin is likely to bind to a number of different cell types through lectin-carbohydrate interaction, its chemotactic activity is cell type-specific, since it does not induce chemotaxis of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes (9.Matsumoto R.

On the other hand, the possibility exists that other galectins may possess chemotaxis activity for different cell types."

Although the route of phylloquinone biosynthesis has not been described in cyanobacteria, the pathway is likely to be similar to the pathway of menaquinone biosynthesis in other bacteria. Menaquinone differs from phylloquinone by the presence of a partly unsaturated, predominantly C-40 side chain rather than a mostly saturated, C-20 phytol side chain. With this exception, the synthesis of the naphthalene nucleus in phylloquinone and menaquinone is expected to include similar steps (Fig.1). The genome data base forSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (17.Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2108) Google Scholar) contains homologs for several genes that encode enzymes for menaquinone biosynthesis:menF (entC) (isochorismate synthase),menD (2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate synthase), menE (O-succinylbenzoic acid-CoA ligase), menB (dihydroxynaphthoate synthase) andmenA (identified as ‚Äúmenaquinone biosynthesis protein,‚Äù but probably a phytyl transferase). Possible homologs ofmenC and ORF241 (the DHNA thioesterase) have also been identified in our data base searches. We propose thatmenF/entC, menD, menE, andmenB of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 are involved in 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate synthesis, whereas the product of amenA homologue catalyzes the addition of phytyl chain. The product of the phytyl transferase, 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, requires a methylation step to become phylloquinone. The gene originally identified as gerC2 (sll1653) in theSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 data base probably codes for the 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyl transferase enzyme that catalyzes this reaction.There is no known function for menaquinone in cyanobacteria except to provide a precursor for phylloquinone biosynthesis. PS II and respiration require plastoquinone-9, which is a benzoquinone derivative that is synthesized by an independent pathway (18.Schultz G. Soll J. Fiedler E. Schultz-Siebert D. Physiol. Plant. 1985; 64: 123-129Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There are two expected consequences of an interruption in the menaquinone pathway: 1) the participation of men genes in the biosynthetic pathway of phylloquinone in cyanobacteria would be confirmed; and 2) the A1 site should be empty, thereby allowing a test of the requirement of phylloquinone in electron transfer from A1to FX. We initially generated mutants in which themenA and menB genes in Synechocystissp. PCC 6803 have been inactivated by targeted mutagenesis. These two mutations were selected because they would additionally allow us to determine whether the phytyl chain is essential for function. If the phytyl chain is dispensable, then the menA deletion mutant may allow the head group 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate to be incorporated into the A1 site. In this paper, we describe the construction, as well as the genetic and functional characterization, of menA and menB mutant strains ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We propose that in the absence of phylloquinone, the A1 site does not remain empty. Instead, we suggest that PS I recruits plastoquinone-9 into the A1 site, and this quinone supports high efficiency electron transfer from A0 to the iron-sulfur clusters.DISCUSSIONAlthough the phylloquinone biosynthetic pathway in cyanobacteria has not been previously described, the nucleotide sequence of theSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome shows the existence of homologues of the menA, menB, menC,menD, menE, menF (entC), and menG genes, which code for enzymes involved in menaquinone biosynthesis in other bacteria. Because they encode enzymes that function near the end of the biosynthetic pathway, we focused exclusively on the menA and menB genes in this study. The menB gene of E. coli codes for 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid synthase, which catalyzes the formation of the two-ring system by convertingo-succinylbenzoyl-coenzyme A to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. Menaquinone differs from phylloquinone by the presence of a partly unsaturated, C-40 isoprenyl tail rather than a mostly saturated, C-20 phytyl side chain attached to the naphthoquinone nucleus. ThemenA gene of E. coli codes for 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate octaprenyl transferase, which catalyzes ligation of the C-40 isoprenyl chain to the C2 position of the naphthoate moiety. The low degree of identity (17%) in the primary sequences of the MenA proteins of E. coli andSynechococcus sp. PCC 6803 is consistent with the difference in the substrate specificity of these enzymes.Because of the structural similarity between menaquinones and phylloquinone, we worked from the premise that the menA andmenB genes code for proteins that function in phylloquinone biosynthesis. To test this premise, we engineered mutants by targeted inactivation of the menA and menB genes inSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Southern blot hybridization and PCR analyses were used to confirm the absence of a completemenA or menB gene in the mutants. HPLC/MS and gas chromatography/MS showed that the membranes of the menA andmenB mutant strains do not contain detectable levels of phylloquinone. Hence, one firm conclusion of this study is that themenA and menB homologues in theSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome code for essential enzymes in the phylloquinone biosynthetic pathway. A corollary to this conclusion is that no other biosynthetic routes to phylloquinone exist beyond naphthoate synthase in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The menA and menB mutants showed similar biochemical and physiological characteristics. Both lacked phylloquinone, and both contained plastoquinone-9 in their PS I complexes. These results further suggest that the phytyl chain of phylloquinone is required for its stable assembly into PS I complexesin vivo. These observations confirm the participation of both the menA and menB gene products in the phylloquinone biosynthesis pathway in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.To study their physiology and growth characteristics, as well as the role of phylloquinone in photosynthetic electron transfer, themenA and menB mutant strains were grown under a variety of conditions. Both mutant strains grew photoautotrophically at low to moderate light intensities (20 and 40 ŒºE m‚àí2s‚àí1) but failed to grow either photoautotrophically or photomixotrophically when the light intensity exceeded 100 ŒºE m‚àí2 s‚àí1. Because photoheterotrophic growth occurs in the mutants at high light intensities when atrazine is present, excess reductant produced by PS II is proposed to be the cause of the failure to grow at high light intensities. Atrazine binds competitively to the QB site in PS II, blocks the high rate of damaging reductant and/or oxidant formation, and allows the cells to survive the toxic effect of light and to use glucose as the source of reduced carbon. We have found that although the amount of PS II is unchanged relative to the wild type, the amount of functional PS I per cell in the menA and menB mutants is approximately 50% lower than in the wild type. The observed phototoxicity may therefore be an indirect effect caused by an imbalance of the rates of electron transport between PS II and PS I. Indeed, we have recently obtained several second-site suppressor mutants that allow a phylloquinone-less mutant to grow photoautotrophically under high light intensity. 2P. Chitnis and J. Golbeck, unpublished results. Most of these mutants have reduced PS II activity, thereby supporting our postulate that the PS II toxicity is responsible for the inability of the phylloquinone-less mutants to grow under high light intensity. The cause of reduction in the PS I level in the menA andmenB mutant cells could be a decreased rate of assembly or an increased turnover rate of PS I complexes. However, an examination of the degradation rate of the PS I apoproteins in the mutant and wild type strains did not show significant differences (data not shown). We therefore suggest that the absence of phylloquinone affects the rate of assembly of PS I complexes by influencing one or more steps involved in its biogenesis.The ability of the menA and menB mutants to grow at low to moderate light intensities agrees with the finding that the absence of phylloquinone did not abolish room temperature photosynthetic electron transfer activity through PS I complexes isolated from these mutants. The mutant strains contained less PS I than the wild type on a per cell basis; additionally, the steady-state rates of electron transfer from cytochrome c 6 to flavodoxin in PS I complexes from the mutants were high but were 82‚Äì84% of the wild type rate. Therefore, the lower rate of whole-chain electron transfer in the mutant cells is a combination of both effects. In PS I complexes isolated from the menA andmenB mutants, electron transfer from P700 to the terminal iron-sulfur clusters is quantitative at cryogenic temperatures. However, in PS I complexes in which phylloquinone has been partially extracted using solvents, the maximum amount of irreversible charge separation after a large number of flashes is independent of the number (0, 1, or 2) of phylloquinone molecules per PS I complex (28.SeÃÅtif P. Ikegami I. Biggins J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Hence, single turnover optical studies of P700 turnover at room temperature will be necessary to confirm the slightly lower quantum efficiency of PS I electron transfer in the menA and menBmutants.The inescapable conclusion from this study is that phylloquinone is not required for efficient electron transfer in PS I at either room or cryogenic temperatures. We considered two explanations for the high rates of PS I activity. One is that the mutant PS I complexes differ from the solvent-extracted PS I complexes in allowing room temperature as well as low temperature electron transfer in the absence of phylloquinone. This bypass may be direct or it may involve a redox-active amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the PsaA and PsaB polypeptides. The second possibility is that a foreign quinone has been recruited into the A1 site and that it may participate in electron transfer from A0 to FX. This quinone, which may be identical to the plastoquinone-9 identified on the basis of the solvent extraction studies described here, may substitute for phylloquinone in the A1 site, thereby promoting electron transfer to FX and FA/FB. Spectroscopic evidence supporting the presence of plastoquinone-9 in the A1 site and its participation in forward electron transfer is provided in the second paper of this series (33.Zybailov B. van der Est A.

PCC 6803 are involved in 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate synthesis, whereas the product of amenA homologue catalyzes the addition of phytyl chain. The product of the phytyl transferase, 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone, requires a methylation step to become phylloquinone. The gene originally identified as gerC2 (sll1653) in theSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 data base probably codes for the 2-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone methyl transferase enzyme that catalyzes this reaction. There is no known function for menaquinone in cyanobacteria except to provide a precursor for phylloquinone biosynthesis. PS II and respiration require plastoquinone-9, which is a benzoquinone derivative that is synthesized by an independent pathway (18.Schultz G. Soll J. Fiedler E. Schultz-Siebert D. Physiol. Plant. 1985; 64: 123-129Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). There are two expected consequences of an interruption in the menaquinone pathway: 1) the participation of men genes in the biosynthetic pathway of phylloquinone in cyanobacteria would be confirmed; and 2) the A1 site should be empty, thereby allowing a test of the requirement of phylloquinone in electron transfer from A1to FX. We initially generated mutants in which themenA and menB genes in Synechocystissp. PCC 6803 have been inactivated by targeted mutagenesis. These two mutations were selected because they would additionally allow us to determine whether the phytyl chain is essential for function. If the phytyl chain is dispensable, then the menA deletion mutant may allow the head group 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate to be incorporated into the A1 site. In this paper, we describe the construction, as well as the genetic and functional characterization, of menA and menB mutant strains ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We propose that in the absence of phylloquinone, the A1 site does not remain empty. Instead, we suggest that PS I recruits plastoquinone-9 into the A1 site, and this quinone supports high efficiency electron transfer from A0 to the iron-sulfur clusters. DISCUSSIONAlthough the phylloquinone biosynthetic pathway in cyanobacteria has not been previously described, the nucleotide sequence of theSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome shows the existence of homologues of the menA, menB, menC,menD, menE, menF (entC), and menG genes, which code for enzymes involved in menaquinone biosynthesis in other bacteria. Because they encode enzymes that function near the end of the biosynthetic pathway, we focused exclusively on the menA and menB genes in this study. The menB gene of E. coli codes for 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid synthase, which catalyzes the formation of the two-ring system by convertingo-succinylbenzoyl-coenzyme A to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. Menaquinone differs from phylloquinone by the presence of a partly unsaturated, C-40 isoprenyl tail rather than a mostly saturated, C-20 phytyl side chain attached to the naphthoquinone nucleus. ThemenA gene of E. coli codes for 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate octaprenyl transferase, which catalyzes ligation of the C-40 isoprenyl chain to the C2 position of the naphthoate moiety. The low degree of identity (17%) in the primary sequences of the MenA proteins of E. coli andSynechococcus sp. PCC 6803 is consistent with the difference in the substrate specificity of these enzymes.Because of the structural similarity between menaquinones and phylloquinone, we worked from the premise that the menA andmenB genes code for proteins that function in phylloquinone biosynthesis. To test this premise, we engineered mutants by targeted inactivation of the menA and menB genes inSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Southern blot hybridization and PCR analyses were used to confirm the absence of a completemenA or menB gene in the mutants. HPLC/MS and gas chromatography/MS showed that the membranes of the menA andmenB mutant strains do not contain detectable levels of phylloquinone. Hence, one firm conclusion of this study is that themenA and menB homologues in theSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 genome code for essential enzymes in the phylloquinone biosynthetic pathway. A corollary to this conclusion is that no other biosynthetic routes to phylloquinone exist beyond naphthoate synthase in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The menA and menB mutants showed similar biochemical and physiological characteristics. Both lacked phylloquinone, and both contained plastoquinone-9 in their PS I complexes. These results further suggest that the phytyl chain of phylloquinone is required for its stable assembly into PS I complexesin vivo. These observations confirm the participation of both the menA and menB gene products in the phylloquinone biosynthesis pathway in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.To study their physiology and growth characteristics, as well as the role of phylloquinone in photosynthetic electron transfer, themenA and menB mutant strains were grown under a variety of conditions. Both mutant strains grew photoautotrophically at low to moderate light intensities (20 and 40 ŒºE m‚àí2s‚àí1) but failed to grow either photoautotrophically or photomixotrophically when the light intensity exceeded 100 ŒºE m‚àí2 s‚àí1. Because photoheterotrophic growth occurs in the mutants at high light intensities when atrazine is present, excess reductant produced by PS II is proposed to be the cause of the failure to grow at high light intensities. Atrazine binds competitively to the QB site in PS II, blocks the high rate of damaging reductant and/or oxidant formation, and allows the cells to survive the toxic effect of light and to use glucose as the source of reduced carbon. We have found that although the amount of PS II is unchanged relative to the wild type, the amount of functional PS I per cell in the menA and menB mutants is approximately 50% lower than in the wild type. The observed phototoxicity may therefore be an indirect effect caused by an imbalance of the rates of electron transport between PS II and PS I. Indeed, we have recently obtained several second-site suppressor mutants that allow a phylloquinone-less mutant to grow photoautotrophically under high light intensity. 2P. Chitnis and J. Golbeck, unpublished results. Most of these mutants have reduced PS II activity, thereby supporting our postulate that the PS II toxicity is responsible for the inability of the phylloquinone-less mutants to grow under high light intensity. The cause of reduction in the PS I level in the menA andmenB mutant cells could be a decreased rate of assembly or an increased turnover rate of PS I complexes. However, an examination of the degradation rate of the PS I apoproteins in the mutant and wild type strains did not show significant differences (data not shown). We therefore suggest that the absence of phylloquinone affects the rate of assembly of PS I complexes by influencing one or more steps involved in its biogenesis.The ability of the menA and menB mutants to grow at low to moderate light intensities agrees with the finding that the absence of phylloquinone did not abolish room temperature photosynthetic electron transfer activity through PS I complexes isolated from these mutants. The mutant strains contained less PS I than the wild type on a per cell basis; additionally, the steady-state rates of electron transfer from cytochrome c 6 to flavodoxin in PS I complexes from the mutants were high but were 82‚Äì84% of the wild type rate. Therefore, the lower rate of whole-chain electron transfer in the mutant cells is a combination of both effects. In PS I complexes isolated from the menA andmenB mutants, electron transfer from P700 to the terminal iron-sulfur clusters is quantitative at cryogenic temperatures. However, in PS I complexes in which phylloquinone has been partially extracted using solvents, the maximum amount of irreversible charge separation after a large number of flashes is independent of the number (0, 1, or 2) of phylloquinone molecules per PS I complex (28.SeÃÅtif P. Ikegami I. Biggins J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 894: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Hence, single turnover optical studies of P700 turnover at room temperature will be necessary to confirm the slightly lower quantum efficiency of PS I electron transfer in the menA and menBmutants.The inescapable conclusion from this study is that phylloquinone is not required for efficient electron transfer in PS I at either room or cryogenic temperatures. We considered two explanations for the high rates of PS I activity. One is that the mutant PS I complexes differ from the solvent-extracted PS I complexes in allowing room temperature as well as low temperature electron transfer in the absence of phylloquinone. This bypass may be direct or it may involve a redox-active amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the PsaA and PsaB polypeptides. The second possibility is that a foreign quinone has been recruited into the A1 site and that it may participate in electron transfer from A0 to FX. This quinone, which may be identical to the plastoquinone-9 identified on the basis of the solvent extraction studies described here, may substitute for phylloquinone in the A1 site, thereby promoting electron transfer to FX and FA/FB. Spectroscopic evidence supporting the presence of plastoquinone-9 in the A1 site and its participation in forward electron transfer is provided in the second paper of this series (33.Zybailov B. van der Est A. Zech S.G. Teutloff C.,. Johnson T.W. Shen G. Bittl R. Stehlik D. Chitnis P.R. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2088046563,"Apaf-1 is an important apoptotic signaling molecule that can activate procaspase-9 in a cytochromec/dATP-dependent fashion. Alternative splicing can create an NH2-terminal 11-amino acid insert between the caspase recruitment domain and ATPase domains or an additional COOH-terminal WD-40 repeat. Recently, several Apaf-1 isoforms have been identified in tumor cell lines, but their expression in tissues and ability to activate procaspase-9 remain poorly characterized. We performed analysis of normal tissue mRNAs to examine the relative expression of the Apaf-1 forms and identified Apaf-1XL, containing both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal inserts, as the major RNA form expressed in all tissues tested. We also identified another expressed isoform, Apaf-1LN, containing the NH2-terminal insert, but lacking the additional WD-40 repeat. Functional analysis of all identified Apaf-1 isoforms demonstrated that only those with the additional WD-40 repeat activated procaspase 9 in vitro in response to cytochrome c and dATP, while the NH2-terminal insert was not required for this activity. Consistent with this result, in vitro binding assays demonstrated that the additional WD-40 repeat was also required for binding of cytochrome c, subsequent Apaf-1 self-association, binding to procaspase-9, and formation of active Apaf-1 oligomers. These experiments demonstrate the expression of multiple Apaf-1 isoforms and show that only those containing the additional WD-40 repeat bind and activate procaspase-9 in response to cytochrome c and dATP.

Genetic studies inCaenorhabditis elegans have identified two genes,ced-3 and ced-4, that are required for programmed cell death (3.Hengartner M.O. Horvitz H.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Once the protein product of ced-3 was determined to be a cysteine protease (4.Miura M. Zhu H. Rorello R. Hartweig E.A. Yuan J. Cell. 1993; 75: 653-660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), a family of multiple related cysteine proteases (designated caspases) was identified and found to function as the executionary arm of the apoptotic program (5.Nunez G.

Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). This executionary arm consists of a proteolytic cascade in which upstream regulatory caspases, such as caspase-9, activate downstream effector caspases, such as caspases-3 and -7 (7.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). In vivo, this process ultimately results in the cleavage of target proteins and the orderly demise and removal of the cell (5.Nunez G. Benedict M.A. Hu Y. Inohara N.

Apaf-1 was identified as a mammalian homologue of CED-4 involved in the cytochrome c-dependent activation of caspase-3 through capase-9 (9.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar), and also as an activity that activates caspases in non-transformed cell extracts (10.Fearnhead H.O. Rodriguez J. Govek E.E. Guo W. Kobayashi R. Hannon G. Lazebnik Y.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13664-13669Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The NH2 terminus of Apaf-1 is highly homologous to CED-4 and contains a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)1 followed by an ATPase domain (9.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). This structural similarity is consistent with their roles as activators of apoptosis. A critical role for Apaf-1 in the regulation of apoptosis was confirmed by the analysis of Apaf-1-deficient mice in which abnormalities were observed in several tissues, particularly the brain, and characterized by the lack of developmental cell death (11.Cecconi F. Alvarez-Bolado G. Meyer B.I. Roth K.A. Gruss P. Cell. 1998; 94: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 12.Yoshida H. Kong Y.Y. Yoshida R. Elia A.J. Hakem A.

In contrast to the NH2 terminus of Apaf-1, the COOH terminus lacks homology with CED-4 and is comprised of either 12 or 13 WD-40 repeats (WDRs) (9.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

In the presence of both cytochrome c and dATP, Apaf-1 is thought to undergo a conformational change such that it binds procaspase-9 (7.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). The activation of caspase-9 is thought to be due to the induced proximity of procaspase-9 molecules, which leads to autoprocessing and enzymatic activation (16.Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. NuÃÅnÃÉez G.

It has been proposed that this assembly of procaspase-9 molecules is mediated by the oligomerization of multiple Apaf-1 molecules (13.Zou H. Li X. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which cytochrome c functions and its binding site remain unknown. Recently, several investigators have described the existence of multiple Apaf-1 splice variants (13.Zou H. Li X. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol.

In tumor cell lines, alternative splicing can create an NH2-terminal 11-amino acid insert between the CARD and ATPase domains or an additional COOH-terminal WDR between the fifth and sixth WDRs. However, the relative expression of these forms and their ability to activate procaspase-9 remain unknown. In the present studies, we used RT-PCR to demonstrate that the Apaf-1 isoform containing both the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal inserts (termed here Apaf-1XL) is the major form expressed in all human tissues examined. A form containing the NH2-terminal insert but lacking the extra WDR was also expressed. Comparative analysis of all the Apaf-1 isoforms isolated to date demonstrated that the NH2-terminal 11-amino acid insert of Apaf-1XL was not required for cytochrome c binding or cytochromec/dATP promotion of procaspase-9 activation. However, only Apaf-1 isoforms containing the additional WDR were able to bind cytochrome c, self-associate, and bind and activate procaspase-9 in a cytochrome c/dATP-dependent fashion. Five Œºg of RNA from HeLa cells, human embryonic kidney 293T cells, or a panel of normal human tissues (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were used to generate first strand cDNA using a commercially available kit (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Full-length Apaf-1 cDNAs were obtained by PCR from 293T cDNA, a HeLa cDNA library, or normal human tissue cDNAs using the specific primers: (5‚Ä≤-GATGGATCCACCCTAGGACCATGGATGCAAAAGCTCGAAATTG-3‚Ä≤ and 5‚Ä≤-CTAGCTAGCTTACTCGAGTTCTAAAGTCTGTAAAATATATAAAATAC-3‚Ä≤). PCR conditions were as follows: 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 ¬∞C, 30 s annealing at 62 ¬∞C, and 5 min extension at 72 ¬∞C, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 ¬∞C. The relative amounts of Apaf-1 cDNAs with or without the NH2-terminal 11-amino acid insert were determined using the specific primers: N1, 5‚Ä≤-AAGAGGAAAAAGTAAG-3‚Ä≤ and N2, 5‚Ä≤-TACTCCACCTTCACACAG-3‚Ä≤ (see Fig. 1), and the following PCR conditions: 25 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 ¬∞C, 30 s annealing at 52 ¬∞C, and 3-min extension at 72 ¬∞C, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 ¬∞C. The relative amounts of Apaf-1 cDNAs with or without the additional COOH-terminal WDR were determined using the specific primers: C1, 5‚Ä≤-CAGCTGATGGAACCTTAAAGC-3‚Ä≤ and C2, 5‚Ä≤-GTCTGGTCATCAGAAGATGTC-3‚Ä≤ (see Fig. 1) and the following PCR conditions: 25 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 ¬∞C, 30 s annealing at 62 ¬∞C, and 3 min extension at 72 ¬∞C, followed by a 10-min extension at 72 ¬∞C. Positive controls for these PCR reactions included as templates, 10-pg samples containing the indicated ratios of gel purified insert DNA from the two Apaf-1 plasmids, Apaf-1XL and Apaf-1S. Specific amplification of Apaf-1 fragments was confirmed using the following negative controls: PCR reactions with no template and PCR reactions performed with first strand cDNA control reactions were made without reverse transcriptase. PCR products were run on 0.8, 1, or 2.5% agarose gels and analyzed by staining with ethidium bromide. Full-length Apaf-1 PCR products were digested with BamHI and XhoI and cloned in-frame into a pcDNA3 vector engineered to encode a COOH-terminal Myc epitope tag (19.Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. NuÃÅnÃÉez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Plasmids were prepared in Escherichia colistrains XL-10 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or STBL2 (Life Technologies, Inc.) grown at 30 ¬∞C to avoid spontaneous mutations. Inserts were sequenced in their entirety. The HeLa Apaf-1 cDNA cloned (termed here Apaf-1S) was identical to that previously described (9.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The Apaf-1 cDNAs cloned from 293T cells, however, contained an additional 11-amino acid NH2-terminal insert and an extra WD repeat (termed here Apaf-1XL; see Fig. 1). Two other full-length Apaf-1 isoforms identified by us (Figs. 1, B, C, andD) and others (13.Zou H. Li X. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol.

The Myc epitope-tagged ‚ÄúN+‚Äù deletion mutant (Apaf-1XL 1‚Äì570) containing the 11-amino acid insert was constructed from the N‚àí construct by replacing the BamHI/EcoRV fragment with that from Apaf-1XL (Fig. 1).

The ‚ÄúC+‚Äù deletion mutant (Apaf-1XL 479‚Äì1248) containing the additional WDR was generated from the C‚àí construct, by replacing the EcoRI fragment with that from pcDNA3 Apaf-1XL (Fig. 1). All hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Apaf-1 constructs were generated by transferring the sequencedBamHI/XhoI cDNA inserts from the pcDNA3-Myc vector to the pcDNA3-HA vector (19.Inohara N. Koseki T.

Wang (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). Both the pcDNA3 HA-procaspase-9 (C287S) mutant and the pcDNA3 procaspase-9 used for thein vitro caspase-9 assay have been previously described (20.Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. NuÃÅnÃÉez G.

Following centrifugation at 17,000 √ó g at 4 ¬∞C, cytosolic extracts were collected and used for either in vitro binding assays or in vitro caspase-9 assays. In some experiments, transfected cells were lysed with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 buffer, as described previously (19.Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S. Wu X. NuÃÅnÃÉez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) prior to immunoprecipitation. Protein immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting with relevent antibodies were performed as described (20.Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. NuÃÅnÃÉez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Mouse anti-HA antibody was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN) and mouse anti-cytochrome cantibody was obtained from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For anti-Apaf-1 immunoblotting, Nonidet P-40 lysates were made as described above, using the following human cell lines: embryonic kidney 293T, breast cancer T47D, cervical cancer C33A, erythroleukemia K562, and monocytic leukemia U937. Apaf-1 protein was detected with two different polyclonal anti-Apaf-1 antibodies obtained from Dr. X. Wang (University of Texas Southwestern Medical School) and Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). Cytosolic extracts were prepared as described above. The in vitro caspase-9 assay was performed as described previously (15.Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. NuÃÅnÃÉez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Reactions were stopped with 5 √ó SDS loading buffer, boiled, and loaded onto a 15% polyacrylamide/SDS gel. Gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. 293T cells were transiently transfected with the indicated Myc- or HA-tagged Apaf-1 plasmid. Cytosolic extracts (see above) of the indicated plasmids were combined with or without 8 Œºg/ml cytochrome c (Sigma), 1 mm dATP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 5 mm ATPŒ≥S (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 or 23 ¬∞C, in the presence of polyclonal anti-Myc antibody and protein A/G-agarose beads. Immunoprecipitation and anti-Myc or -HA immunoblotting was performed as described above. 4 √ó 107 293T cells were transfected with Myc-tagged pcDNA3, pcDNA3-Apaf-1XL, or pcDNA3-Apaf-1LN. 24 h post-transfection, S-100 cytosolic extracts were prepared as described (20.Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Wu D. Inohara N. NuÃÅnÃÉez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Then 300 Œºl of lysates were loaded on a Superdex-200 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a Bio-Rad BioLogic HR Workstation. The column was calibrated with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech HMW gel filtration protein standards kit plus carbonic anhydrase and cytochromec (thyroglobulin, M r = 669,000; ferritin, M r = 440,000; catalase,M r = 232,000; bovine serum albumin,M r = 66,000; carbonic anhydrase,M r = 29,000; cytochrome c, M r = 12,400). After discarding the majority of the void volume, fractions of 400 Œºl were collected. Aliquots of 50 Œºl from each fraction were run on a SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel followed by immunoblotting with anti-Myc polyclonal antibody. Aliquots of 50 Œºl from each fraction were also incubated with 100 Œºm DEVD-AMC to measure DEVDase activity. Assays of DEVD-AMC cleaving activity were carried out as described (22.Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods: Companion Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar) using synthetic fluorogenic substrate Ac-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Ac-DEVD-AMC) (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). 50 Œºl from each column fraction were assayed in 100 Œºl of caspase assay buffer (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Chaps, 10% sucrose). The reaction was started with addition of 100 Œºm DEVD-AMC and AMC released was measured at various times following the start of the reaction. The DEVD-AMC cleaving activity was expressed as normalized fluorescence produced after 3 h incubation at 37 ¬∞C. Previous studies in our laboratory analyzed the mechanism by which the carboxyl terminus of Apaf-1 binds and inhibits the NH2 terminus, preventing oligomerization and caspase-9 activation (16.Hu Y. Ding L. Spencer D.M. NuÃÅnÃÉez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33489-33494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cytochrome cwas reported to bind to purified Apaf-1 and be required as a co-factor for Apaf-1-mediated procaspase-9 activation (7.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 9.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the inhibitory effect of the COOH-terminal WDRs might be relieved by binding to cytochrome c. However, we were unable to demonstrate cytochrome c binding (Fig. 3 A) to the Apaf-1S isoform originally described by Zou et al. (9.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar) and also cloned by us from HeLa cDNA (Fig.1). We also noticed that endogenous 293T Apaf-1 protein appeared to migrate somewhat slower than transfected Apaf-1S (Fig. 1 E), and in our hands we were unable to demonstrate cytochrome c/dATP-dependent in vitro activation of procaspase-9 by the Apaf-1S isoform (Fig.2). We, therefore, used RT-PCR to clone other potential full-length Apaf-1 cDNAs from 293T cells. Two full-length Apaf-1 cDNAs were cloned from 293T cells and were identical to the Apaf-1S isoform, except that they contained an 11-amino acid insert (GKDSVSGITSY) at position 98 between the CARD and ATPase domain and a 43-amino acid WDR inserted between the fifth and sixth existing WDRs of Apaf-1S (Fig. 1 A) (15.Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. NuÃÅnÃÉez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The presence of the NH2-terminal insert is consistent with the utilization of an alternative exon donor site in exon 3 and a single acceptor site in exon 4 (GenBank accession numbers AF098871 andAF098873, respectively). The presence of the additional COOH-terminal WDR is consistent with the utilization of an additional exon 17a (GenBank accession numbers AF117658 and AF117659). Recently, Zouet al. (13.Zou H. Li X. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar) have also reported the cloning of this Apaf-1 cDNA from HeLa cells. For consistency and clarity in this paper, we have termed this isoform Apaf-1XL (15.Hu Y. Benedict M.A. Ding L. NuÃÅnÃÉez G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). This was done to distinguish it from two other alternative human Apaf-1 cDNA splice variants (13.Zou H. Li X. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol.

We constructed these two alternative Apaf-1 cDNAs using the Apaf-1S and Apaf-1XL cDNAs as described under ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures.‚Äù For clarity in this paper, we have termed them Apaf-1LC (long COOH terminus: containing the additional WDR, but lacking the NH2-terminal insert) and Apaf-1LN (long NH2 terminus: containing the NH2-terminal insert, but lacking the additional WDR) (Fig. 1 A).Figure 2Cytochromec-dependent in vitroactivation of procaspase-9 requires the additional WD-40 repeat. Ten Œºg cytosolic extracts of 293T cells transiently transfected with either the vector control or the indicated Myc-tagged or untagged Apaf-1 isoforms were incubated with in vitrotranslated [35S]methionine-labeled procaspase-9, with or without 1 mm dATP, 8 Œºg/ml cytochrome c, or 5 mm ATPŒ≥S at 30 ¬∞C for 30 min.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3586-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). To determine if multiple Apaf-1 cDNAs are present in normal human tissues, we performed full-length Apaf-1 PCR analysis on cDNAs generated from normal human tissue RNAs (Fig.1 B). This analysis demonstrated the existence of at least two Apaf-1 cDNA forms. The larger form co-migrated with the cloned Apaf-1XL fragment, while the smaller form migrated slightly above that of Apaf-1S (Fig. 1 B). Restriction mapping of each of these gel purified full-length Apaf-1 PCR products confirmed their identities as Apaf-1 cDNAs. 2M. Benedict and G. NuÃÅnÃÉez, unpublished results. Because of limited gel resolution, minor amounts of other Apaf-1 cDNAs may have been present but not detectable. To better examine the relative amounts of the different Apaf-1 forms, we performed PCR analysis of the human tissue cDNAs using two sets of primers that flank the two different insertions. Primers N1 and N2 flank the NH2-terminal 11-amino acid insertion, while primers C1 and C2 flank the additional WDR (Fig. 1 A). PCR analysis using primers N1 and N2 showed that in all tissues the great majority of the products (>80%) contained the 11-amino acid NH2-terminal insertion, as determined by comparison with control reactions containing various ratios of Apaf-1XL and Apaf-1S DNAs (Fig.1 C). PCR analysis using primers C1 and C2 showed that in all tissues both types of products are represented, although the relative amounts of the two types varied among the tissues (Fig. 1 D). A compilation of the PCR results from Fig. 1, C andD, suggests that the major full-length Apaf-1 cDNAs observed in most of these tissues appears to be Apaf-1XL (containing both NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal insertions). At the level of mRNA expression, tissues such as bone marrow, colon, and spleen appear to have roughly equal amounts of Apaf-1XL and Apaf-1LN (containing just the NH2-terminal insertion), while tissues such as brain, kidney, stomach, and skeletal muscle express more Apaf-1XL. To determine whether multiple Apaf-1 isoforms are also expressed at the protein level, we examined multiple cell lines by immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti-Apaf-1 antibody. Lysates of 293T cells transiently transfected with the different Apaf-1 forms (described in Fig.1 A) were run as controls. The major immunoreactive band in each of the cell lines co-migrated with the Apaf-1XL form (Fig.1 E), which is consistent with the data from t"

The 20-kDa CymA is a member of the NapC/NirT family of multiheme cytochromes, which are invariably anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and are postulated to mediate electron flow between quinols and periplasmic redox proteins. CymA was found to contain four low-spinc-hemes, each with bis-His axial ligation, and midpoint reduction potentials of +10, ‚àí108, ‚àí136, and ‚àí229 mV. The 85-kDa OmcA is located at the outer membrane of S. frigidimarina NCIMB400, and as such might function as a terminal reductase via interaction with insoluble Fe(III) substrates. This putative role is supported by the finding that the protein was released into solution upon incubation of harvested intact cells at 25 ¬∞C, suggesting an attachment to the exterior face of the outer membrane.

FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 20: 305-313Crossref Google Scholar). Since access of this respiratory substrate to the periplasmic compartment of the cell is denied by the formation of highly insoluble polymeric Fe(III) oxyhydroxides at circumneutral pH, outer membrane (OM)1 proteins may be required for reduction to occur. An unprecedented pathway would thus have to exist in which electrons were transferred from primary dehydrogenases to the cell exterior, with the concomitant generation of a proton-electrochemical gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (CM). It is now becoming apparent that such a model might be fitted to the reduction of insoluble forms of Fe(III) by the versatile facultative anaerobe Shewanella putrefaciens. This bacterium has been demonstrated to grow on Fe(III) oxyhydroxides with H2, formate, lactate, or pyruvate serving as the electron source (2.Lovley D.R. Phillips E.J.P. Lonergan D.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1989; 55: 700-706Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other insoluble terminal electron acceptors used by S. putrefaciens include Mn(IV) oxides (3.Myers C.R. Nealson K.H. Science. 1988; 240: 1319-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar) and elemental sulfur (4.Moser D.P. Nealson K.H. Appl. Environ.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3429-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) fractions. An essential component of the electron transport pathway to Fe(III) inS. putrefaciens is a 21-kDa tetraheme c-type cytochrome, CymA, as revealed by transposon mutagenesis studies in strain MR-1 (7.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary structure analysis has indicated CymA to be a member of the widespread NapC/NirT redox family (7.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These multiheme proteins are invariably anchored to the CM, and are postulated to oxidize insoluble quinols and reduce soluble periplasmic enzymes such as nitrate or nitrite reductases (8.Roldan M.D. Sears H.J.

When reduced, the cytochromes in OM fractions are readily reoxidized upon addition of Fe(III), suggesting that they may be involved in reduction of the metal cation by intact cells (9.Myers C.R.

An 83-kDa c-type cytochrome, OmcA, has been purified from OM fractions of S. putrefaciensMR-1 (9.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1326: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The sequence of the omcA gene indicates that the translated protein possesses an N-terminal phospholipid attachment site and 10 CXXCH c-heme binding motifs (10.Myers J.M. Myers C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Further genetic analysis has revealed omcA to be part of a 13-kilobase gene cluster,mtrDEF-omcA-mtrCAB 2GenBank acession number AF083240. 2GenBank acession number AF083240.which is predicted to encode four further c-type cytochromes. MtrC and MtrF are putative decaheme proteins located at the OM, while MtrA and MtrD are putatively decaheme but located in the periplasmic compartment of the bacterium. Two non-heme OM proteins, MtrE and MtrB, are also predicted to be encoded by this DNA sequence, and transposon mutagenesis has demonstrated the expression of MtrB to be essential for the respiration of Fe(III) by S. putrefaciens MR-1 (11.Beliaev A.S. Saffarini D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 6292-6297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among several other species of Shewanella capable of Fe(III) respiration is Shewanella frigidimarina (formerly S. putrefaciens) NCIMB400 (12.Reid G.A. Gordon E.H.J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1999; 49: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Studies on the anaerobic metabolism of this bacterium have mainly focused on a 64-kDa periplasmic tetraheme flavocytochrome c 3, Fcc3, which functions as a physiological fumarate reductase (13.Reid G.A. Gordon E.H.J. Hill A.E. Doherty M. Turner K. Holt R. Chapman S.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). A related protein has been reported to be present in S. putrefaciens MR-1 (14.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. Lett. Appl. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 162-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Small tetraheme c-type cytochromes of approximately 12 kDa have also been purified from both S. frigidimarinaNCIMB400 (13.Reid G.A. Gordon E.H.J. Hill A.E. Doherty M. Turner K. Holt R. Chapman S.K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and S. putrefaciens MR-1 (15.Tsapin A.I. Nealson K.H. Meyers T. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beuumen J. Crosby L.D. Feinberg B.A. Zhang C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6386-6388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we present the purifications of membranousc-type cytochromes from S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 that correspond to the CymA and OmcA proteins from S. putrefaciens MR-1. The subsequent detailed magneto-optical spectroscopic study of CymA is the first to be reported for any protein in a native form from the NapC/NirT family, while similar characterization of OmcA is the first for any hemoprotein located at a bacterial OM. S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 and the type strain of S. putrefaciens (NCIMB10471; ATCC8071) were purchased from the National Collections of Industrial and Marine Bacteria (Aberdeen, United Kingdom). S. putrefaciens MR-1 was supplied by Dr. G. A. Reid, University of Edinburgh, UK. The temperatures employed for cell growth were 25 ¬∞C (S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 andS. putrefaciens MR-1) or 30 ¬∞C (S. putrefaciens type strain). Microaerobic growth was achieved in the basal medium of Luria-Bertani (g/liter: tryptone 10; yeast extract 5; NaCl 10) adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH, and supplemented with 50 mmdl-lactate. Cultures of 1 liter were shaken at 250 rpm in 2-liter foam-plugged flasks until the late logarithmic phase of growth was attained. Anaerobic growth of theShewanella species with 50 mm Fe(III) citrate present as respiratory substrate was achieved by the protocol of Dobbinet al. (16.Dobbin P.S. Butt J.N. Powell A.K. Reid G.A. Richardson D.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Microaerobically or anaerobically grown cells ofShewanella species were harvested by centrifugation at 15,900 √ó g and 4 ¬∞C for 10 min, and resuspended in 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5 (20 ml per 1-liter culture). Cell breakage was achieved by two passes through a chilled French pressure cell operated at 3 000 p.s.i. Membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 235,000 √ó g and 4 ¬∞C for 1 h, then washed with 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5. Ultracentrifugtion was repeated prior to final resuspension in the same buffer (10 ml per 1-liter culture). Membrane fractions derived from cells of S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 grown either microaerobically or anaerobically with Fe(III) citrate were employed in solubilizations with Triton X-100. Membranes (45 mg/ml protein) were stirred with the detergent (20 mg/ml) in 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, at 4 ¬∞C for 1 h. Unsolubilized material was then removed by ultracentrifugation at 235,000 √ó g and 4 ¬∞C for 1 h. Both the 20-kDa CymA and 85-kDa OmcA hemoproteins were purified from detergent-solubilized membrane fractions of S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 cells that had been grown in microaerobic cultures totalling 20 liters. All chromatographic, dialysis, and concentration steps were performed at 4 ¬∞C. Solubilized material was dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) anion exchange column (5 √ó 100 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mg/ml Triton X-100. After washing with 2 column volumes of equilibration buffer, a linear gradient 0‚Äì500 mm NaCl was applied over 2 column volumes. Fractions containing the 20-kDa CymAc-type cytochrome, which eluted at approximately 200 mm NaCl, were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, as were fractions containing 85-kDa OmcA, which eluted at approximately 450 mm NaCl. Both proteins were detergent exchanged using a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B anion exchange column (2 √ó 50 cm) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mg/ml Triton X-100. After washing with 5 column volumes of, 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7, containing 0.2 mg/ml dodecyl maltoside, linear gradients of 0‚Äì250 or 250‚Äì500 mm NaCl were applied over 10 column volumes to elute CymA or OmcA, respectively. CymA was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Waters AP-2 DEAE column (2 √ó 45 cm) previously equilibrated in 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.0, containing 0.2 mg/ml dodecyl maltoside. After washing with 3 column volumes of equilibration buffer, a linear gradient of 0‚Äì250 mm NaCl was applied over 6 column volumes. Prior to spectroscopic characterizations, samples of CymA and OmcA were concentrated and buffer exchanged by ultrafiltration (Amicon; 3- and 30-kDa cut-off membranes, respectively). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid method (17.Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar) with 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin serving as the standard. Analyses of Shewanella membranes and fractions from column chromatographies were routinely performed by SDS-PAGE. Slab gels of 10 or 15% acrylamide were employed for resolution of proteins, with samples being loaded via a stacking gel of 5% acrylamide. The samples were prepared for electrophoresis by incubating with 3 m urea and 90 mm SDS at room temperature for 1 h. Gels were examined for the presence ofc-type cytochromes by heme-linked peroxidase staining (18.Thomas P.E. Ryan D. Levin W. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 75: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). For N-terminal sequence determinations, 5 Œºm solutions of CymA or OmcA were boiled with 700 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 35 mm SDS. The proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and subsequently electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (0.2 Œºm, Bio-Rad). Sequence cycles were acquired on an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer by Dr. M. Naldrett, John Innes Center, Norwich, UK. Electronic absorption spectra were acquired on an SLM Aminco DW-2000 UV-vis spectrophotometer. EPR spectra were recorded on a Brucker Spectrospin ER-200D X-band spectrometer, equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9 liquid helium flow cryostat, and interfaced to an ESP1600 computer. MCD spectra were measured using a split-coil superconducting solenoid, Oxford Instruments type SM-4, capable of generating a maximum magnetic field of 5 T. Spectropolarimeters JASCO J-500D and J-730 were employed for the wavelength ranges 240‚Äì100 and 800‚Äì2000 nm, respectively. For quantification of thec-hemes present in both the 20-kDa CymA and 85-kDa OmcA membranous cytochromes from S. frigidimarina NCIMB400, protein (3 Œºm) was initially incubated with pyridine (2.1m) and NaOH (75 mm) in water at room temperature for 15 min. Sodium dithionite and potassium ferricyanide were then added to separate aliquots of the resulting solution such that the final concentrations of protein, reductant, and oxidant were 2.5 Œºm, 1.5 mm, and 750 Œºm,respectively. Heme content was determined using the difference absorption coefficient of 11.3 mm‚àí1cm‚àí1 at 550 nm for the pyridine ferrohemochrome minus pyridine ferrihemochrome spectrum (19.Bartsch R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 23: 344-363Crossref Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Mediated spectrophotometric redox potentiometry was undertaken using methodology described by Dobbinet al. (16.Dobbin P.S. Butt J.N. Powell A.K. Reid G.A. Richardson D.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Titrations with dithionite of 3.2 Œºm oxidized CymA, and 4.4 Œºm oxidized OmcA, were performed under argon atmosphere at 15 ¬∞C in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, respectively, with these buffers each containing 0.2 mg/ml dodecyl maltoside. After additions of reductant, an equilibration time of 10 min was allowed before acquisition of a spectrum in the range 500‚Äì700 nm. The reduction potentials reported for the hemes of CymA and OmcA are referenced to the SHE. Duroquinol and menaquinol were prepared by the method of Reiske (20.Reiske J.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 239-245Crossref Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Donation of electrons from these reduced species (50 Œºm) to the oxidized 20-kDa CymA cytochrome (2 Œºm) in 20 mm NaHEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.2 mg/ml dodecyl maltoside, was monitored by scanning in the region 500‚Äì600 nm using an Hitachi U300 spectrophotometer. The reaction between the dithionite-reduced 85-kDa OmcA cytochrome (1 Œºm) and Fe(III)-EDTA (100 Œºm) in identical buffer was analyzed by stopped-flow spectrophotometry using protocols detailed by Dobbin et al. (16.Dobbin P.S. Butt J.N. Powell A.K. Reid G.A. Richardson D.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The presence of potentially homologous c-type cytochromes in membrane fractions of Shewanella species was investigated by SDS-PAGE. Both the type and MR-1 strains of S. putrefaciens, and also S. frigidimarina NCIMB400, were found to produce four major c-heme containing membranous proteins during the anaerobic respiration of Fe(III) (Fig. 1,lanes 1‚Äì3). Moreover, the apparent molecular masses for these cytochromes, namely 85, 70, 55, and 20 kDa, were equivalent for the three Shewanella species. In S. putrefaciensMR-1, the cytochrome of apparent molecular mass 85 kDa has previously been purified from OM fractions (9.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1326: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and designated OmcA. The gene encoding this protein has been characterized, and suggests that mature OmcA is an OM decaheme c-type cytochrome featuring an N-terminal lipid modification (10.Myers J.M. Myers C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previous SDS-PAGE analysis after fractionations of S. putrefaciens MR-1 membranes has demonstrated the 70-kDa hemoprotein of this bacterium to also be located at the OM (6.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3429-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of nucleotide sequencing data for themtrC gene of S. putrefaciens MR-1, which is predicted to encode an OM decaheme protein of a near equivalent molecular mass, the 70-kDa cytochrome apparent on heme-stained gels is most probably the putative MtrC protein. Also in S. putrefaciens MR-1, the cytochrome of apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa has been identified as a CM protein, and designated CymA (7.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence data for cymA suggests the mature protein to be tetraheme, and a transposon mutation in the gene causes an absence of the 20-kDa cytochrome in SDS-PAGE gels of the CM fraction (7.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these previous findings, the 85-, 70-, and 20-kDa membranous cytochromes from S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 apparent in our SDS-PAGE analysis were considered to most probably be respective homologs of the OmcA, MtrC, and CymA proteins from S. putrefaciens MR-1. SDS-PAGE analysis of the membrane fraction of S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 grown microaerobically also revealed the 85- and 70-kDa hemoproteins to be present (Fig.2, lane 1). However, the relative abundance of the 70-kDa cytochrome compared with the 85-kDa protein was markedly higher in membranes from cells cultured by Fe(III) respiration (Fig. 1, lane 3) as opposed to microaerobically (Fig. 2, lane 1). Using methods previously applied toS. putrefaciens MR-1 (6.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3429-3438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which involved preparation of CM and OM fractions using sucrose density gradients, the 70- and 85-kDa cytochromes of S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 were indicated to reside at the OM of the bacterium (data not shown). Furthermore, compelling evidence for these hemoproteins having such subcellular location was obtained from an experiment simply involving resuspension in buffer of harvested intact cells of S. frigidimarinaNCIMB400 from a microaerobic culture. Following incubation at 25 ¬∞C and subsequent centrifugation, SDS-PAGE analysis of the supernatant demonstrated both the 85- and 70-kDa membranous c-type cytochromes to have been extracted into the buffer solution (Fig. 2,lane 2). By appraisal of band intensities, removal of the 70-kDa hemoprotein from intact cells was more easily facilitated during the incubation. As no periplasmic cytochromes were found in the supernatant by SDS-PAGE, cell lysis was deemed not to have occurred. Comparable results were obtained using intact cells from cultures grown by Fe(III) respiration. In addition to localizing the 85- and 70-kDa membranous cytochromes to the OM of S. frigidimarinaNCIMB400, and thus providing further evidence for these proteins being homologs of the S. putrefaciens MR-1 OmcA and putative MtrC respectively, the intact cell incubation experiment suggests both hemoproteins to be anchored at the external face of the OM. Furthermore, all hemes in the 85- and 70-kDa cytochromes are indicated to be in a singular globular structure, as opposed to any arrangement whereby hemes are located at both the periplasmic and external faces of the OM. This latter had been considered possible in that primary sequence analyses for the OmcA (10.Myers J.M. Myers C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and putative MtrC2 fromS. putrefaciens MR-1 demonstrate the 10 CXXCH heme binding motifs present in both proteins to cluster in two groups of five, each encompassing approximately 130‚Äì180 amino acids, and separated by approximately 200 amino acids. Attempts were initially made to solubilizec-type cytochromes from the membrane fraction of S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 cultured by the anaerobic respiration of Fe(III). This resulted in less than 2% of the membranous hemoprotein present being solubilized on employment of up to 40 mg/ml Triton X-100. However, using the membrane fraction of cells grown microaerobically, approximately 90% of c-heme was solubilized with 20 mg/ml of the detergent. SDS-PAGE analysis of the solubilized material demonstrated the c-type cytochromes to be present in the relative ratios noted in the membrane fraction. A single anion exchange column was found to achieve a separation of the majority of the 85-kDa cytochrome present from all other proteins (Fig. 1, lane 4, and Fig. 2, lane 3) while a further purification step using fast protein liquid chromatography was required to give a homogeneous sample of the 20-kDa hemoprotein (Fig. 1, lane 5). Typical yields obtained from 20 liters of S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 grown microaerobically were 25 and 5 mg of the 85- and 20-kDa detergent-solubilized membranous c-type cytochromes, respectively. Attempts were made to obtain N-terminal protein sequence data on both the 20- and 85-kDa membranousc-type cytochromes from S. frigidimarinaNCIMB400. For the 20-kDa protein, duplicate experiments indicated the N terminus to be blocked. Sequence data was, however, obtained for the 85-kDa protein, with the first 10 amino acids at the N-terminal being determined as XXGSDGGDAT. The OmcA c-type cytochrome from the OM of S. putrefaciens MR-1 has previously been subjected to similar sequencing, and the corresponding data XGGSDGKDGE was obtained (10.Myers J.M. Myers C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At least five of the first 10 amino acids are therefore identical at the N-terminal of the 85-kDa cytochrome from S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 and the OmcA protein of S. putrefaciens MR-1. In view of the previous variations noted in primary sequence data for cytochromes of similar structure and function in these Shewanella species (12.Reid G.A. Gordon E.H.J. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1999; 49: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), this degree of identity is strongly supportive of the 85-kDa cytochrome from S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 being a homolog of the OmcA protein of S. putrefaciens MR-1. Characterization of the omcA gene has predicted the first amino acid in the mature OmcA protein from S. putrefaciens MR-1 to be cysteine, and this residue has been proposed to form a lipid attachment site to the OM of the bacterium (10.Myers J.M. Myers C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The visible absorption spectra obtained for the fully reduced 20- and 85-kDa membranous cytochromes from S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 are presented in Fig.3, A and B,respectively. Both give absorbance maxima that are characteristic ofc-heme containing proteins, namely Œ±-, Œ≤-, and Œ≥-bands centered at 552, 523, and 420 nm, respectively. The visible absorption spectra obtained for the fully-reduced 20- and 85-kDa cytochromes in solution saturated with CO are also shown in Fig. 3, A andB, respectively, and the changes in features caused by the presence of this potential heme ligand indicate interactions to occur with both proteins. The binding of CO to ferrous heme can occur either at a vacant sixth co-ordination site or by displacement of an axial ligand from the polypeptide chain. Expected spectral shifts upon CO ligation to reduced c-type cytochromes are increases in the Œ±- and Œ≤-band wavelength maxima accompanied by a decrease in the Œ≥-band wavelength maximum (21.Blyth D.J. Aylott J.W. Richardson D.J. Russell D.A. Analyst. 1995; 120: 2725-2730Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The traces obtained for the reduced 20- and 85-kDa cytochromes in the presence of CO show a combination of features in the Œ±,Œ≤-region that represent both ferrous heme and CO-ligated ferrous heme. Not all of the ferrous hemes in these multiheme species thus interact with CO, and a bound:unbound ratio of 1:1 can be estimated for both proteins. Quantifications of hemes in the 20- and 85-kDa c-type cytochromes were based on assumptions that theM r values of the corresponding apoproteins were 20,000 and 80,000. The pyridine hemochrome spectra then indicated nearest integer values of 4 and 10 mol of c-heme to be present per mole of polypeptide in the holoproteins. These data provide further support for the cytochromes purified from S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 being respective homologs of the putative tetraheme CymA (7.Myers C.R. Myers J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1143-1152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and decaheme OmcA (10.Myers J.M. Myers C.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 237-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) from S. putrefaciens MR-1. The UV-vis absorption spectra of both the air-oxidized 20- and 85-kDa membranous c-type cytochromes from S. frigidimarina NCIMB400 (Figs.4 A and 5 A,respectively) were found not to be altered by addition of ferricyanide. The full oxidation of these proteins in as-prepared samples was confirmed by room temperature MCD spectra collected in the UV-vis region (Figs. 4 B and 5 B), which featured none of the characteristic signatures of ferrous heme. Over the wavelength range 300‚Äì600 nm, intense low-spin ferric heme MCD bands have been shown to invariably dominate those derived from high-spin ferric heme (22.Cheesman M.R. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1991; 36: 201-255Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the Soret region of MCD spectra (‚àº400 nm), a single low-spin heme is known to give rise to a derivative shaped band with a peak to trough intensity of approximately 150 m‚àí1cm‚àí1 T‚àí1, and the MCD spectra in Figs.4 B and 5 B are plotted against concentrations calculated from this value. The UV-vis absorption spectra in Figs.4 A and 5 A are plotted against concentrations similarly derived, and indicate the molar extinction coefficients per low-spin heme at 410 nm implied by MCD spectroscopy for the fully-oxidized 20- and 85-kDa cytochromes as 138,000 and 121,000, respectively. The presence of low-spin ferric heme in both oxidized proteins is supported by the forms and intensities of Œ±,Œ≤-MCD bands observed. UV-visible absorption and MCD spectroscopies of the 20- and 85-kDa cytochromes also indicate no high-spin ferric hemes to be featured. Characteristic charge transfer bands (largely porphyrin ‚Üí ferric heme) for this state, which appear at ‚àº630 nm as a distinct shoulder in a UV-vis spectrum and as a derivative shaped feature in a MCD spectrum, were not observed for either protein.Figure 5UV-visible absorption and MCD spectra of air-oxidized 85-kDa cytochrome from S. frigidimarinaNCIMB400, and MCD spectrum of the dithionite-reduced protein.

https://openalex.org/W1991987072,"Arachidonic acid is converted to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) by the cyclooxygenase activities of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases (PGHSs) 1 and 2. The initial, rate-limiting step is abstraction of the 13-proS hydrogen from arachidonate which, for PGG2 formation, is followed by insertion of O2at C-11, cyclization, and a second O2 insertion at C-15. As an accompaniment to ongoing structural studies designed to determine the orientation of arachidonate in the cyclooxygenase site, we analyzed the products formed from arachidonate by (a) solubilized, partially purified ovine (o) PGHS-1; (b) membrane-associated, recombinant oPGHS-1; and (c) a membrane-associated, recombinant active site mutant (V349L oPGHS-1) and determined kinetic values for formation of each product. Native forms of oPGHS-1 produced primarily PGG2 but also several monohydroxy acids, which, in order of abundance, were 11R-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,12E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (11R-HETE), 15S-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15S-HETE), and 15R-HETE. V349L oPGHS-1 formed primarily PGG2, 15S-HETE, and 15R-HETE but only trace amounts of 11R-HETE. With native enzyme, the K m values for PGG2, 11-HETE, and 15-HETE formation were each different (5.5, 12.1, and 19.4 Œºm, respectively); similarly, theK m values for PGG2 and 15-HETE formation by V349L oPGHS-1 were different (11 and 5 Œºm, respectively). These results establish that arachidonate can assume at least three catalytically productive arrangements within the cyclooxygenase site of oPGHS-1 leading to PGG2, 11R-HETE, and 15S-HETE and/or 15R-HETE, respectively. IC50 values for inhibition of formation of the individual products by the competitive inhibitor, ibuprofen, were determined and found to be the same for a given enzyme form (i.e. 175 Œºm for oPGHS-1 and 15 Œºm for V349L oPGHS-1). These latter results are most simply rationalized by a kinetic model in which arachidonate forms various catalytically competent arrangements only after entering the cyclooxygenase active site. Arachidonic acid is converted to prostaglandin G2 (PGG2) by the cyclooxygenase activities of prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases (PGHSs) 1 and 2.

Native forms of oPGHS-1 produced primarily PGG2 but also several monohydroxy acids, which, in order of abundance, were 11R-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,12E,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (11R-HETE), 15S-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15S-HETE), and 15R-HETE. V349L oPGHS-1 formed primarily PGG2, 15S-HETE, and 15R-HETE but only trace amounts of 11R-HETE. With native enzyme, the K m values for PGG2, 11-HETE, and 15-HETE formation were each different (5.5, 12.1, and 19.4 Œºm, respectively); similarly, theK m values for PGG2 and 15-HETE formation by V349L oPGHS-1 were different (11 and 5 Œºm, respectively). These results establish that arachidonate can assume at least three catalytically productive arrangements within the cyclooxygenase site of oPGHS-1 leading to PGG2, 11R-HETE, and 15S-HETE and/or 15R-HETE, respectively. IC50 values for inhibition of formation of the individual products by the competitive inhibitor, ibuprofen, were determined and found to be the same for a given enzyme form (i.e. 175 Œºm for oPGHS-1 and 15 Œºm for V349L oPGHS-1). These latter results are most simply rationalized by a kinetic model in which arachidonate forms various catalytically competent arrangements only after entering the cyclooxygenase active site. prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase ovine PGHS-1 17-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,10E)-heptadecatrienoic acid 11-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,12E,13Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid 11-hydroperoxy-(5Z,8Z,12E,13Z)-eicosatetraenoic acid 15-hydroxy-(5Z,8Z,11Z,13E)-eicosatetraenoic acid high performance liquid chromatography reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography cyclooxygenase-1 cyclooxygenase-2 prostaglandin Prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthases 1 and 2 (PGHS-1 and -2)1 catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid and O2 to PGH 2: the committed step in the formation of prostanoids (prostaglandins, thromboxane A2 (see Refs. 1.Smith W.L.

These enzymes are homodimeric (‚àº72 kDa/subunit), heme-containing, glycoproteins with two catalytic sites; moreover, PGHSs represent a prototype of a new class of integral membrane proteins that appear to be anchored to one leaflet of the lipid bilayer through the hydrophobic surfaces of amphipathic helices and not through more typical transmembrane domains (3.Smith W.L.

PGHSs catalyze two separate reactions: a cyclooxygenase (bis-oxygenase) reaction in which arachidonate is converted to PGG2 and a peroxidase reaction in which PGG2undergoes a two-electron reduction to PGH2.

The cyclooxygenase reaction begins with a rate-limiting abstraction of the 13-proS hydrogen from arachidonate to yield an arachidonyl radical (26.Hamberg M. Samuelsson B. J. Biol.

This is followed by sequential oxygen additions at C-11 and C-15 to yield the prostaglandin endoperoxide PGG2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs compete directly with arachidonate for binding to the cyclooxygenase site and inhibit cyclooxygenase activity, but have little or no effect on peroxidase catalysis (28.Mizuno K.

Studies comparing native and aspirin-acetylated PGHS-2 have raised the possibility that arachidonate can bind in distinct orientations in the PGHS-2 active site to produce either PGG2 plus 11R-HETE or 15R-HETE (32.Xiao G. Tsai A.L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have examined the products formed from arachidonate by native ovine (o) PGHS-1 and a cyclooxygenase active site mutant, V349L oPGHS-1, and have determined the kinetics for the formation of each individual product. We have also determined the IC50 values for the inhibition of formation of each product by ibuprofen. Collectively, our results indicate that arachidonate can be bound in the cyclooxygenase active site of oPGHS-1 in at least three different, catalytically competent arrangements that lead to PGG2, 11R-HETE, and 15-HETE, respectively, and that these three arrangements of arachidonate occur subsequent to its entry into the cyclooxygenase active site.

Forty hours following transfection, cells were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Sham-transfected cells were collected in an identical manner. Microsomal preparations were used for Western blotting and for cyclooxygenase and peroxidase assays.

Fractions from the DEAE-cellulose column were assayed for peroxidase activity and protein concentration. Desired fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto an equilibrated S-300 column overnight. Fractions from the DEAE and S-300 columns were used for assays with partially purified enzyme. The specific cyclooxygenase activity was 2‚Äì10 units/mg for DEAE fractions and 15‚Äì30 units/mg for S300 fractions. One unit of enzyme is defined as that amount of enzyme which will catalyze the oxygenation of 1 Œºmol of arachidonate/min. Forty hours following transfection, COS-1 cells were collected, sonicated, and resuspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Aliquots of the cell suspension (75 Œºg of protein) or 5 cyclooxygenase activity units of partially purified oPGHS-1 were incubated for 1 min at 37 ¬∞C with various concentrations of [1-14C]arachidonic acid with and without 200 Œºm flurbiprofen. Radioactive products were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography as described previously (38.Smith W.L. Lands W.E.M.

The retention times of the methyl esters of 15R- and 15S-HETE were 25 and 27 min, respectively. Retention times for the methyl esters of 11R- and 11S-HETE were 26 and 28 min, respectively. Cyclooxygenase assays were performed at 37 ¬∞C by monitoring the initial rate of O2 uptake using an oxygen electrode (39.Rieke C.J. Mulichak A.M. Garavito R.M. Smith W.L. J. Biol.

Reactions were initiated by adding 100 Œºl of 0.3 mmH2O2, and the absorbance at 610 nm was monitored with time. As presented below (see ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù), two different kinetic schemes were developed to model mechanisms by which oPGHS-1 could produce different products with different kinetic properties.

Statistical significance was determined using a two-samplet test assuming equal variances. Microsomal preparations of oPGHS-1 and V349L oPGHS-1 from COS-1 cells transfected with plasmids encoding native oPGHS-1 or V349L oPGHS-1 as well as partially purified native oPGHS-1 from seminal vesicles were used to determine overall K m values for the oxygenation of arachidonate using an oxygen electrode assay. The K m values were 3 Œºm both for solubilized, partially purified and for membrane-associated, recombinant native oPGHS-1; as expected, this value is in the range (2‚Äì8 Œºm) reported previously for recombinant and purified forms of ovine, murine, and human PGHS-1 (20.Gierse J.K.

Western transfer blotting indicated that V349L oPGHS-1 was expressed in COS-1 cells at the same level as native oPGHS-1 (data not shown) and had 65% of the cyclooxygenase activity and 100% of the peroxidase activity of native oPGHS-1 expressed in parallel transfections. As illustrated in Fig. 1, oPGHS-1 and V349L oPGHS-1 formed the same products from [1-14C]arachidonate including those products derived from PGG2 (HHTre, PGD2, PGE2, and PGF2‚Äú) and the monohydroxy acids 11-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,12E, 14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (11-HETE) and 15-hydroxy-5Z, 8Z,11Z,13E-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), which are derived from reduction of the corresponding hydroperoxides. However, V349L oPGHS-1 produced substantially larger amounts of 15-HETE and relatively less PGG2 and 11-HETE (Fig. 1) than native enzyme. With 2 Œºm arachidonate and 5 cyclooxygenase units of either partially purified oPGHS-1 or broken cell preparations of COS-1 cells expressing oPGHS-1, 95% of the products were derived from PGG2, 3% was 11-HETE, and 2% was 15-HETE; with 2 Œºm arachidonate and broken cell preparations of COS-1 cells expressing V349L oPGHS-1, 70% of the product was PGG2, <0.5% was 11-HETE, and 30% was 15-HETE. Extracts from incubation mixtures containing partially purified oPGHS-1, recombinant oPGHS-1 or recombinant V349L oPGHS-1 were incubated with different concentrations of arachidonate and then separated by RP-HPLC. 11- and 15-HETE were isolated, converted to their methyl esters, and examined by chiral HPLC. This is illustrated in Fig.2 for partially purified native oPGHS-1 incubated with 100 Œºm arachidonate. 11-HETE was exclusively 11R-HETE. 15-HETE was 70% 15S-HETE and 30% 15R-HETE. The ratio of 15S-HETE to 15R-HETE was the same for both purified and microsomal, recombinant oPGHS-1. Similarly, the 15-HETE fraction derived from incubation of arachidonate with V349L oPGHS-1 contained 70% 15S-HETE and 30% 15R-HETE; only trace amounts of 11-HETE were formed by V349L oPGHS-1, and the chirality of this latter product was not determined. Interestingly, the enantiomeric composition of the 15-HETE product was 65‚Äì70% 15S-HETE and 30‚Äì35% 15R-HETE at all arachidonate concentrations tested with both native and V349L oPGHS-1 (i.e. when 2, 5, 10, 20, 35, 50, or 100 Œºm arachidonate was used as the substrate with purified oPGHS-1; when 10 and 100 Œºm arachidonate was used as the substrate for membrane-associated, recombinant oPGHS-1; or when 2, 5, 10, 20, 35, 50, or 100 Œºm arachidonate was used as the substrate for membrane preparations of recombinant V349L oPGHS-1). We noted in the studies outlined above that there were obvious differences in the relative ratios of the monohydroxy fatty acid and PGG2-derived products at different arachidonate concentrations. Accordingly, we performed a series of measurements to determine the K m values for the formation of the different products by native oPGHS-1 (Fig.3) and V349L oPGHS-1 (Fig.4). The results are summarized in TableI. It should be noted that the amounts of enzyme (5 units for partially purified native enzyme or 75 Œºg of broken COS-1 cell protein for V349L oPGHS-1) used in these assays were adjusted so that <25% of the total substrate was consumed even with the lowest concentration of arachidonate tested (2 Œºm). Product formation was analyzed after 1-min incubations by radio thin layer chromatography and/or by RP-HPLC. The key finding of these experiments is that the K m values for the formation of PGG2, 11-HETE, and 15-HETE by native oPGHS-1 and theK m values for PGG2 and 15-HETE formation by V349L oPGHS-1 were different for each product (Table I).Figure 4Effect of arachidonic acid concentration on the formation of PGG2 and 15-HETE by V349L oPGHS-1.

Three different isoforms of Œ±1 subunits (Œ±1S, Œ±1C, and Œ±1D) serve as pore-forming subunits of the three groups of L-type channels: class S, class C, and class D. Two size forms for each of these isoforms have been detected in native tissues (1.De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For the Œ±1D isoform, alternative splicing of mRNA may give rise to the short and long forms (6.Ihara Y. Yamada Y. Fujii Y. Gonoi T. Yano H. Yasuda K. Inagaki N. Seino Y. Seino S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 121-130PubMed Google Scholar). However, this does not appear to be the case for the Œ±1C and Œ±1S isoforms, and it appears that the shorter forms of the Œ±1C and Œ±1S proteins are generated by a post-translational, proteolytic processing event. In the case of these two proteins, it appears that processing would produce C-terminal fragments of 30‚Äì50 kDa (1.De Jongh K.S. Warner C. Colvin A.A. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While little is known about the fate of the cleaved C-terminal domain, results obtained from immunofluorescence studies have suggested that the C terminus of the Œ±1C subunit is present in stoichiometric amounts and co-localized with the body of the Œ±1C subunit and the Œ≤ subunit (5.Gao T.

This suggests the possibility that the C-terminal fragments may remain functionally associated with the channels. The C-terminal region of the Œ±1C subunit is involved in many important processes which regulate the class C calcium channel. The major site of PKA1-mediated phosphorylation of the Œ±1C subunit has been shown to be Ser1928 in the C terminus (4.De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A.

Removal of up to 70% of the C terminus from the full-length Œ±1C protein results in an increase in open probability when compared with the full-length channel (12.Wei X. Neely A. Lacerda A.E.

Thus, the C terminus of Œ±1C is a very important region for the regulation of the calcium channel, and the proteolytic processing of the C terminus could conceivably impact many aspects of channel function. Since the results from immunocytochemical analysis of the C terminus of Œ±1C in intact cardiac myocytes suggest that this domain is present and co-localizes with the ‚Äúbody‚Äù of the Œ±1C subunit and the Œ≤2 subunit (5.Gao T.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19401-19407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), it is possible that the Œ±1C subunit is cleaved in vivo and that the C-terminal fragment of ‚àº50 kDa remains associated with the 190-kDa body or with other channel subunits or unknown proteins. In order to begin to study this hypothesis, we have developed approaches to study the processing of an heterologously expressed Œ±1C subunit and the properties of the C-terminal region of this protein. The catalytic (C)-subunit of PKA was purified to homogeneity from bovine heart as described previously (17.Wu J.C. Chuan H. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Myocytes were lysed using a Brinkman Polytron homogenizer, and these lysates were used in the in vitro proteolysis assay as described below. L-type calcium channels were purified from frozen rabbit hearts as described (5.Gao T. Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Chien A.J. Green R.D. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

Mutants of the Œ±1C subunit were generated with the Transformer Mutagenesis Kit (CLONTECH) using the rabbit Œ±1Csubunit cDNA. The deletion of amino acids 1966‚Äì2004 in the rabbit Œ±1C subunit (Œ±1CŒîPRD) was generated with three primers: one selection primer and two mutant primers, one which generated a new NheI site at the C-terminal end of the PRD and one which created the new restriction site at the N-terminal end of the PRD. The new NheI sites were digested to remove the PRD sequence, and the vector was then religated to form the PRD deletion mutant construct. The wild-type (WT) and mutant cDNAs of the Œ±1C subunit were subcloned into the pCR3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) and were coexpressed with the rat Œ≤2a subunit (and Œ±2Œ¥ where indicated) in tsA cells by CaPO4 precipitation (18.Chien A.J.

Cell membranes were prepared 48 h post-transfection. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 √ó g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in ice cold ‚Äúhomogenization buffer‚Äù (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA). Cells were lysed using a Brinkman Polytron homogenizer (power setting 5 or 6, 3 pulses of 10 s each). The homogenate was then centrifuged at 1,000 √ó g for 5 min to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant after this low-speed spin was centrifuged at 100,000 √ó g for 20 min to separate the membrane/particulate fraction (pellet) from the soluble/cytosolic (supernatant) fraction. Finally, the pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of homogenization buffer and protein concentration was determined prior to use in the experiments described below. Baculovirus-mediated expression of the Œ±1C subunit with or without and coexpression of the Œ±2Œ¥ and Œ≤2a subunits in Sf9 insect cells was performed as described (20.Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L.

In vitro translated (IVT) Œ±1CC-terminal proteins were expressed from cDNAs subcloned into the pCR3 vector using the TNT-T7 Quick coupled transcription and translation system (Promega). A fusion protein expression vector, pCR3-His/Myc, was derived from pCR3 by insertion of both 6-His and Myc tags fused at the N terminus. IVT proteins were labeled during synthesis with [35S]methionine and used in the GST pull-down experiments detailed below. Crude membrane preparations from tsA cells or Sf9 insect cells expressing either the Œ±1C subunit alone or with Œ≤2a subunits were used for cleavage assays as specified. Cleavage reactions contained membrane preparations, indicated protease, and ‚Äúcleavage buffer‚Äù (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 2.5 mm dithiothreitol). Cleavage reactions with exogenously added protease (100 Œºl) were performed at 25 ¬∞C with various concentrations of protease and for various amounts of time as specified. For proteolysis of the expressed channel with cardiac myocyte lysates, the expressed Œ±1C subunit was added to whole cell lysates from isolated cardiac myocytes for either 10 min at 4 ¬∞C or overnight at 37 ¬∞C prior to the addition of Laemmli buffer (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205511) Google Scholar) followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis (18.Chien A.J.

Where indicated, cleavage reactions were stopped by addition of 17.4 Œºg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 100 Œºmtosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and centrifuged at 100,000 √ó g for 20 min to separate the membrane and cytosolic fractions. Membranes were washed twice by resuspending the membrane pellet in 100 Œºl of cleavage buffer followed by centrifugation to isolate the membrane fraction as described above. In vitrophosphorylation of the Œ±1C subunit prior to chymotrypsin cleavage was performed as described previously (20.Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Zhao X.L. Ladner M.B. Hosey M.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23590-23597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pGEX-4T3 GST bacterial expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified as outlined by the manufacturer. In each reaction, the indicated in vitro translated C-terminal protein from the Œ±1C subunit was diluted in 200 Œºl of ‚Äúbinding buffer‚Äù (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), added to 20 Œºl of glutathione-Sepharose beads precoupled to either GST alone (control) or to one of the various GST-SH3 fusion proteins, and incubated for 5‚Äì16 h at 4 ¬∞C with agitation. The GST-SH3 beads were washed 5 times with 1 ml each of binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and after the last wash, 15volume of Laemmli buffer was added to each. The IVT proteins which bound to the GST-SH3/glutathione-Sepharose beads were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the35S-labeled IVT proteins were detected by autoradiography. Competition of the GST-SH3 binding to the IVT Œ±1CC-terminal proteins was performed using a non-radiolabeled IVT Œ±1C PRD protein. The non-labeled PRD was immunoblotted using the anti-Myc antibody (1:50 dilution) as the primary antibody and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-coupled antibody as the secondary antibody. The amount of the non-labeled PRD was determined by comparison of the immunoreactivities of the non-labeled and the35S-labeled Œ±1C PRD. The non-labeled PRD was added to the GST-SH3 binding reactions at 5 times the concentration of each of the various IVT 35S-labeled C-terminal proteins, and the binding reactions were performed as described above. TsA cells were transiently co-transfected with the wild-type (WT) rat Œ≤2a subunit and the WT Œ±1C subunit, Œ±1CŒî1905, or Œ±1CŒîPRD. Each construct was in the pCR3 vector and 3 Œºg of each was used per 10-cm plate, along with the CD8 reporter vector, œÄ H3-CD8 (0.5 Œºg/10 cm plate) (25.Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar), using the Effectene transfection kit following the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Qiagen). At 38‚Äì40 h following transfection, cells were replated on 3-cm collagen-coated plates (Sigma). Transfected cells were visualized by using the anti-CD8 antibody-coated Dynabeads (Dynal) (25.Jurman M.E. Boland L.M. Liu Y. Yellen G. BioTechniques. 1994; 17: 876-881PubMed Google Scholar). For the measurement of Ba2+ currents through L-type calcium channels, the external solution consisted of 10 mmBaCl2, 105 mm NaCl, 25 mm CsCl, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The pipette solution was composed of 100 mm cesium aspartate, 40 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. Membrane currents were measured in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique using fire-polished borosilicate glass pipettes (GF-150-10, Warner Instrument Corp.) generated with a horizontal puller (P-95 Fleming and Poulsen) with a final resistance between 2‚Äì4 megohm. Membrane currents were amplified using a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments) and analog-filtered using a low-pass Bessel filter (1‚Äì3 kHz corner frequency). Data were digitally stored using an IBM compatible PC equipped with a hardware/software package (ISO2 by MFK) for voltage control, data acquisition, and data evaluation. Cells were clamped at ‚àí90 mV and voltage pulses (test pulses) (100-ms duration) to +10 mV were applied every 10 s in order to activate L-type calcium channels. Current-voltage relationships were measured by varying the potential of the test pulses from ‚àí40 to +30 mV after reaching a steady state of the current amplitude. Capacitative currents due to recharging the cell membrane were compensated and leak currents were subtracted. Currents were normalized to capacitance. The summarized data were pooled from at least two different transfections and are expressed as mean ¬± S.E. In order to begin to understand the processing of the native cardiac Œ±1C subunit from the full-length, 240-kDa protein to the truncated, 190-kDa form, and to define the properties of the C-terminal fragments resulting from the proteolytic cleavage of the Œ±1C subunit, we subjected an expressed, full-length Œ±1C subunit to a variety of conditions designed to induce proteolysis. The Œ±1Csubunit was heterologously expressed in Sf9 insect cells by baculovirus infection, which resulted in the expression of only the full-length, 240-kDa protein in Sf9 cell membranes (Fig.1) (20.Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Zhao X.L. Ladner M.B. Hosey M.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9605-9615Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Although the native cardiac and brain Œ±1C protein has been isolated in the presence of a battery of protease inhibitors (2.Hell J.W. Yokoyama C.T. Wong S.T. Warner C. Snutch T.P. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19451-19457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5.Gao T. Puri T.S. Gerhardstein B.L. Chien A.J. Green R.D. Hosey M.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18929-18937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was possible that the truncation was an artifact resulting from uncontrolled proteolysis during protein isolation. Therefore, initially, the heterologously expressed, full-length Œ±1Csubunit was exposed to extracts from lysed cardiac myocytes to determine if the proteolytic event(s) which processed the cardiac Œ±1C subunit could be reproduced in vitro with the heterologously expressed Œ±1C subunit. The myocyte lysates were prepared after stimulating the myocytes with several reagents that might conceivably alter proteolytic activity. The results showed that under a variety of conditions the heterologously expressed Œ±1C subunit, when expressed either alone or with the Œ≤2 and Œ±2Œ¥ subunits, was resistant to any proteases which may have been present and active in the myocyte extracts (Fig. 1). Virtually no change in the mobility of the expressed Œ±1C subunit was observed when this protein was incubated with or without myocyte lysates for 10 min at 4 ¬∞C (Fig. 1). Only when the reactions were allowed to proceed at 37 ¬∞C overnight was there a marked loss of the 240-kDa full-length Œ±1Cprotein when the myocyte lysate was added to the expressed Œ±1C (Fig. 1). However, neither under these circumstances nor during the shorter incubations was a C-terminal truncated 190-kDa form of the Œ±1C subunit generated. If this form of the protein was generated, it would have been readily detected by the Card I antibody as this antibody recognizes an internal epitope in the linker between domains II and III (Fig.2 B). These results suggested that the proteolytic cleavage of the native Œ±1C subunit isolated from cardiac myocytes was not an artifact resulting from the isolation process because exposure of the heterologously expressed Œ±1C subunit to the same cardiac, cellular proteases which the native Œ±1C subunit would have been exposed to upon cell lysis did not cause cleavage of the expressed Œ±1Csubunit. Since the cardiac myocyte lysates did not induce truncation of the expressed, full-length Œ±1C subunit, other means were used in an attempt to duplicate the proteolytic processing seen with the native Œ±1C subunit. The baculovirus-expressed Œ±1C subunit in Sf9 cell membranes was subjected to limited proteolysis with a variety of exogenous proteases in an attempt to reproduce the cleavage which occurred on the cardiac Œ±1C subunit, and to potentially enable the development of a model system with which to study the properties of the cleaved channel products. Several different proteases were used in thesein vitro proteolysis assays including chymotrypsin, trypsin, subtilisin, proteinase K, carboxypeptidase, papain, thermolysin, and calpain. The latter has been suggested to cleave the Œ±1Csubunit in hippocampal neurons (26.Hell J.W. Westenbroek R.E. Breeze L.J. Wang K.K. Chavkin C. Catterall W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3362-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Many of these proteases did cleave the expressed Œ±1C subunit (not shown), but only chymotrypsin, an extracellular serine protease that most likely is not responsible for the cleavage of the channel in native systems, produced the expected 190-kDa C-terminal truncated product of the Œ±1C subunit (Fig. 2). Limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin generated a 190-kDa protein lacking its C terminus as evidenced by the reactivity of the 190-kDa fragment to the Card I antibody but not to the Card C antibody, which recognizes the final 14 amino acids of the C terminus (Fig. 2, A and B). The 190-kDa product of the Œ±1C subunit generated by chymotrypsin had the same apparent molecular mass as the truncated, native Œ±1C subunit isolated from cardiac tissue (Fig.2 A, right). Another cleavage product of ‚àº90 kDa was recognized by the Card I antibody but not the Card C antibody, suggesting that it represented a cleavage product from an internal domain of Œ±1C. In addition, chymotrypsin generated C-terminal fragments of approximately 30‚Äì56 kDa (Fig. 2 A, left). The C-terminal fragment of ‚àº56 kDa corresponded to the expected size if the C-terminal domain was cleaved in a single region, and its immunoreactivity to Card C suggested that it contained an intact C terminus. The C-terminal 30‚Äì48-kDa fragments also contained intact C termini as evidenced from their immunoreactivity toward Card C. Since chymotrypsin could produce proteolytic products that were similar to those expected from the native, purified Œ±1Csubunit, we reasoned that in vitro proteolysis with chymotrypsin could allow for the development of a model system to study the properties and potential interactions of the cleavage products. The solubility of the chymotryptic C-terminal fragments was determined. The C-terminal fragments should contain no predicted membrane-spanning regions and are hydrophilic (27.Mikami A. Imoto K. Tanabe T. Niidome T. Mori Y. Takeshima H. Narumiya S. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 340: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). However, after centrifugation of the chymotryptic reaction mixtures, the chymotrypsin-cleaved C-terminal fragments of the Œ±1Csubunit remained associated with the membrane fraction and were not released into the soluble fraction (Fig.3). Solubilization studies were performed following limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin but prior to centrifugation to separate the membrane and soluble fractions. While the C-terminal fragments remained associated with the membrane fraction under control conditions, several of the solubilization conditions that were tested released the C-terminal fragments from the membrane fraction to the cytosolic fraction. Most notably, addition of 500 mm NaCl to the cleavage reactions caused the partial release of the C-terminal fragments from the membrane (Fig. 4). The solubility of the C-terminal peptides of the Œ±1C subunit in NaCl suggested that the membrane association was likely to involve a protein-protein interaction. The C-terminal fragments could be binding to the truncated Œ±1C subunit present in the membrane, or with an unknown protein in the crude membrane fractions. An important consideration for understanding the cleavage of the Œ±1C subunit is that a site that has been identified to play a role in the regulation of channel activity by PKA (7.Perets T. Blumenstein Y. Shistik E. Lotan I. Dascal N. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8.Gao T. Yatani A. Dell'Acqua M.L. Sako H. Green S.A. Dascal N. Scott J.D. Hosey M.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 185-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) is predicted to reside in the C-terminal domain that is cleaved. In order to test whether this site at Ser1928 was present in the C-terminal fragments and to test how phosphorylation might affect interaction of the fragments with the membrane, the chymotryptic fragments were phosphorylated in vitro with PKA. In the first of two protocols, crude membrane preparations containing the baculovirus-expressed Œ±1C subunit were phosphorylated with PKA and [Œ≥-32P]ATP, solubilized, immunoprecipitated with the Card I antibody, and then subjected to limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin (Fig.5 A, lanes 1 and 3). This procedure allowed for the isolation of C-terminal, chymotryptic fragments of about 48‚Äì56 kDa which were indeed phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 5 A). Both the immunoblot and the autoradiograph from this procedure also showed a fraction of the Œ±1C subunit which remained uncleaved by chymotrypsin and was phosphorylated by PKA. Similar results were obtained when crude membranes containing the Œ±1C subunit were phosphorylated with PKA and then cleaved with chymotrypsin prior to immunoprecipitation of the C-terminal fragments with the Card C antibody (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and4). A smaller amount of the phosphorylated 30-kDa C-terminal fragment was also isolated under these conditions (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2 and 4). These results demonstrated that a PKA phosphorylation site, presumably at Ser1928 (4.De Jongh K.S. Murphy B.J. Colvin A.A. Hell J.W. Takahashi M. Catterall W.A.

We show here, by yeast and mammalian two-hybrid analyses and by pull-down experiments, that JAB1 also interacts with both the progesterone receptor (PR) and the steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1) and that it stabilizes PR-SRC-1 complexes. We also show that JAB1 potentiates the activity of a variety of transcription factors known to associate with SRC-1 (nuclear receptors, activator protein-1, and nuclear factor Œ∫B). This occurs without any modification of PR or SRC-1 concentration. JAB1 is a subunit of a large multiprotein complex that has been called the COP9 signalosome.

Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) using the c-Jun N-terminal activation domain as a bait. It was shown that JAB1 potentiates target gene transcription activation by AP1 proteins (especially c-Jun and JunD) (1.Claret F-X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). This initial study also pointed to the sequence homology between JAB1 and the yeast protein Pad-1. The latter has been demonstrated to be necessary for the transcriptional activity of Pap-1, the yeast equivalent of c-Jun (1.Claret F-X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M.

Furthermore it was shown that JAB1 could functionally replace Pad-1 in yeast. Thus JAB1 and Pad-1 appeared to play similar roles in mammalian and yeast cells, respectively. However, recent studies have uncovered the true human homolog of Pad-1, which has been called POH-1. Both Pad-1 and POH-1 are components of the 26 S proteasome (3.Sparato V. Toda T. Craig R.

On the contrary JAB1 is not found in the proteasome but has very recently been shown to be a subunit of a different multiprotein complex that has been called the signalosome (or COP9 signalosome). This complex contains several proteins with sequence homologies to proteins present in the regulatory 19 S subunit of the 26 S proteasome (5.Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R.

It has been proposed that the latter and the signalosome have a common evolutionary origin but have diverged to assume different cellular functions. Moreover recent studies have shown an interaction of Fos/Jun with SRC-1. The latter potentiates AP11-mediated gene transactivation (8.Lee S.-K. Kim H.-J. Na S.-Y. Kim T.S. Choi H.-S. Im S.-Y.

Coactivators CBP and p300 also have intrinsic histone acetylase activity. Histone acetylation destabilizes nucleosomes at gene regulatory sites and thus increases transcription. Recent studies have shown SRC-1, CBP, and nuclear receptors to be present in large multiprotein complexes (27.McKenna N.J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We show here that JAB1 interacts with both nuclear receptors and SRC-1 and activates transcription at the corresponding target genes.

DBDGal4-PR1‚Äì930, DBDGal4-PR547‚Äì930, and DBDGal4-PR897‚Äì930 vectors used for two-hybrid experiments in mammalian cells were constructed by subcloning the inserts of pAS2-PR corresponding mutants into the pmvector. Isolation of a truncated JAB1 cDNA by the two-hybrid screen (see below) led us to clone the full-length cDNA of JAB1. This was performed by three independent rounds of polymerase chain reaction from the human placenta cDNA library (CLONTECH) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with the sense primer 5‚Ä≤-ATTAAGAATTCCTTCCTCGGCGATGGC and the 3‚Ä≤ reverse primer 5‚Ä≤-ATAAAGGATCCCTTCTCAGAGACTGTTTAAGAGATGTT. 2The resultingEcoRI/BamHI fragment encoding the full-length sequence of JAB1 (nucleotides ‚àí11 to 1020) was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pSG5 (Stratagene) to create pSG5-JAB1. The same fragment was also subcloned into the same sites of a modified pSG5 vector (pSG5-HA) resulting in the N-terminal in frame fusion of JAB1 with the HA epitope (pSG5-HA-JAB1). Two differences were observed with the JAB1 sequence reported by Karin and co-workers (1.Claret F-X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The first was a G/T change in the Val127 codon which was silent. The second one was a A/G change that transformed the amino acid His129into an arginine. It should be noted that Arg129 is conserved in the sequence of JAB1 homologs pad1 and POH-1 (2.Shimanuki M. Saka Y. Yanagida M. Toda T. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 569-579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Sparato V. Toda T. Craig R. Seeger M. Dubiel W. Harris A.L. Norbury C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30470-30475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The full-length JAB1 cDNA was also subcloned from the pSG5-JAB1 into the yeast pAS2‚Äì1 and pACT2 vectors expressing DBDGal4-JAB1 and ADGal4-JAB1, respectively. The same DNA fragments were introduced into pM and pVP16 vectors resulting in the expression of DBDGal4-JAB1 or ADVP16-JAB1 fusion protein in mammalian cells, respectively. Finally, the full-length JAB1 was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal GST fusion protein by inserting the full-length cDNA into the pGEX-3X vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (pGEX-JAB1 vector). The SRC-1 cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from the human placenta cDNA library as three overlapping fragments of similar size. The 5‚Ä≤ upper primer and 3‚Ä≤ lower primer used were CCCGAAGATCTGGTGTGAAGTTTTTCAACATGAGTG and AAGCCAGATCTAATTTCACATTCCTTTAAAAGTGGTTATT, respectively. The entire open reading-frame of SRC-1 (nucleotides ‚àí18 to 5493) was finally reconstituted into the BglII site of pSG5 vector (pSG5-SRC-1). The full-length cDNA was entirely sequenced on both strands and corresponds to the sequence of the SRC-1 published by Takeshita et al. (15.Takeshita A. Cardona G.R. Koibuchi N. Suen C.-S. Chin W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27629-27634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), classified as SRC-1a by Kalkhoven et al. (30.Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The SRC-1 cDNA was further subcloned from pSG5-SRC-1 into the pSG5-HA vector. This construction (pSG5-HA-SRC-1) resulted in the N-terminal in frame fusion of SRC-1 (nucleotides ‚àí18 to 4348) with the HA epitope. The yeast ADGal4-SRC-1 vector was obtained by inserting the SRC-1 cDNA into the pACT2 vector. The construct ADVP16-SRC-1 for the mammalian two-hybrid system was obtained by cloning the same DNA fragment into the pVP16 vector. The expression vectors for SRC-1 mutants were generated from the pSG5-HA-SRC-1 vector. The SRC-1 mutants A (pSG5-HA-SRC- 1Œî215‚Äì1138), B (pSG5-HA-SRC-1568‚Äì1440), and C (pSG5-HA-SRC-1782‚Äì1440) were obtained by ligation of the blunted HindIII, EcoRI, andEcoRI/BamHI digests, respectively. The SRC-1 mutants D (pSG5-HA-SRC-1568‚Äì1208), E (pSG5-HA-SRC-1782‚Äì1208), and F (pSG5-HA-SRC-11‚Äì1208) were obtained by replacing the 3‚Ä≤MscI/BglII fragment by a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a stop codon in SRC-1 mutants B and C and in wild-type SRC-1, respectively. The expression vector encoding the full-length rabbit progesterone receptor (pSG5-rPR) and the reporter plasmid PRE2-TATA-CAT have previously been described (31.Guiochon-Mantel A. Savouret J.F. Quignon F. Delabre K. Milgrom E. De TheÃÅ H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1791-1803PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid ERE2-TATA-CAT was obtained by replacing theBamHI/BglII fragment of the PRE2-TATA-CAT vector with the synthetic oligonucleotide containing two EREs and a TATA box GATCCGGTCACAGTGACCAGCTACGGTCACAGTGACCGGATCTGAGGTCCACTTCGCTATATATTCCCCA. The plasmids encoding the other nuclear receptors and their respective reporter plasmids have been previously described (31.Guiochon-Mantel A. Savouret J.F. Quignon F. Delabre K. Milgrom E. De TheÃÅ H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1791-1803PubMed Google Scholar). The reporter plasmids ‚àí73Col-TK-CAT and NFŒ∫B-CAT and the expression vector for p65 RelA (pCMV-Rel A) have been described (32.Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed by the lithium acetate method as described (34.Transy C. Legrain P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The yeast strain PJ69‚Äì4A (MatŒ±; trp1-901; leu2-3, 112; ura3-52; his3-200; gal4Œî; gal80Œî; Ade2::GAL2p-ADE2; LYS2::GAL1p-HIS3; met2::GAL7p-Lacz) (35.James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genomics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Google Scholar) was cotransformed with the pAS-PR897‚Äì930 as bait vector and the cDNA library plasmids. 106 transformants were plated on SC medium (36.Adams A. Gottschling D.E. Kaiser C.A. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 148Google Scholar) lacking leucine, tryptophane, histidine, and adenine (SC/‚àíLeu,‚àíTrp,‚àíHis,‚àíAde) for 6 days at 30 ¬∞C. Colonies were picked and grown into 24-well plates with 1.5 ml of the same minimal liquid medium containing either 30 or 50 mm 3AT, which resulted in a competitive inhibition of the His3 reporter gene product. Thirty clones growing in 50 mm 3AT were selected. They were submitted to three rounds of culture on SC/‚àíLeu liquid medium to eliminate bait plasmid. Each Trp‚àí clone was then mated with the Y187 strain (MatŒ±; gal4Œî; gal80Œî; his3-200; trp1-901; ade2-101; leu2-3, 112; ura3-52; met‚àí; URA3::GAL1p-lacz) (CLONTECH) containing either the DBDGal4-PR897‚Äì930 or the DBDGal4-PR547‚Äì930 or the control pAS2 vectors. Diploids were selected by plating on SC/‚àíTrp,‚àíLeu medium, and the specificity of the two-hybrid interaction was determined by screening for ADE2 and HIS3 reporter gene activities on SC/‚àíTrp,‚àíLeu,‚àíHis,‚àíAde liquid medium containing 50 mm3AT. In the case of cells expressing DBDGal4-PR547‚Äì930, screening was performed in the absence or presence of either 1 Œºm R5020 or 10 Œºm RU486. Plasmids were isolated from the corresponding clones initially selected on 50 mm 3AT medium. The placenta library plasmids were segregated by transformation of the E. coli MH1066 strain (Leu‚àí, Trp‚àí, Ura‚àí) (37.Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) by plating on M9/‚àíLeu minimal medium. The plasmids were then purified (Qiagen resin) and sequenced (ABI-Perkin 373A automated sequencer) using primers complementary to pACT2. The Y526 yeast strain (MatŒ±, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, gal4-542, gal80-538, URA3:::GAL1p-LacZ) was transformed with various plasmids (see figure legends) and plated on SC/‚àíTrp,‚àíLeu medium. Cultures derived from 3‚Äì6 batches of three isolated colonies were grown in SC/‚àíTrp,‚àíLeu liquid medium for 48 h at 30 ¬∞C and then diluted into 24-well plates with 1.5 ml of the same medium containing 1 Œºm R5020, 10 Œºm RU486, or no steroid. After growing to the end of the log phase, the Œ≤-galactosidase activity of the cells was measured as described by Transy and Legrain (34.Transy C. Legrain P. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1995; 21: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells or HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Seromed). 3 √ó 105 cells were seeded per well of a six-well multiwell dish in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped serum, and cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation procedure as described previously (38.Guiochon-Mantel A. Loosfelt H. Ragot T. Bailly A. Atger M. Misrahi M. Perricaudet M. Milgrom E. Nature. 1988; 336: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). All transfections were performed with 330 Œºl of calcium-phosphate precipitate/well containing the reporter gene and expression vectors as indicated for each experiment, and total DNA was normalized to 20 Œºg/ml of precipitate using salmon sperm DNA. The CAT activity was measured with the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA protein assay (Pierce), and the CAT activity was corrected for protein content. The pGEX-JAB1 vector was used in the BL21 strain of E. coli to synthesize the GST-JAB1 fusion protein. The manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were followed except that ethylene glycol (10%) (39.Ghosh S. Basu S. Strum J.C. Basu S. Bell R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 376-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and sarkosyl (1%) (40.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar) were introduced in the extract buffer to increase the solubilization of the aggregated protein. After centrifugation, Triton X-100 (2%) was added (buffer A), and the cleared lysate was incubated with GST Sepharose-4B for 1 h at 20 ¬∞C. The gel beads were then poured into a column, washed first with 20 volumes of buffer A, and then washed with 50 volumes of an inverse gradient buffer made with buffer A and buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, pH 8). The amount of GST-JAB1 present in the affinity gel was quantified by Laemmli-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. More than 50% of the solubilized fusion protein contained in the crude extract were finally bound to the affinity gel. The gel was stored in aliquots at ‚àí20 ¬∞C. 35S- and 3H-radiolabeled proteins were synthesized by transcription of pSG5 expression vectors and subsequent translation using the TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Protein-protein interactions were studied as described (41.Smith C.L. Nawaz Z. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) using binding buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0). 5 Œºl of the in vitro-translated lysate were incubated with 10 Œºg of the GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose in binding buffer in the presence or absence of 1 Œºm R5020. Representative gels were stained with Coomassie Blue before being subjected to autoradiography to ensure that equal amounts of GST fusion proteins were included in each reaction. 35S radioactivity was quantified using the Instant Imager (Packard). To study the formation of the ternary complex PR/SRC-1/JAB1, PR and SRC-1 were synthetized respectively as [3H]leucine- and [35S]methionine-labeled proteins, whereas JAB1 was unlabeled. Translation was stopped by adding buffer C (buffer B containing 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and 50 Œºg/ml RNase A. After ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 √ó g (4 ¬∞C). [3H]PR (5 Œºl of lysate), [35S]SRC-1 (10 Œºl of lysate), and various concentrations of JAB1 or control lysate (transcription-translation in presence of empty pSG5 vector) were mixed together to a 50-Œºl final volume in buffer C and incubated overnight at 4 ¬∞C. The complexes were then incubated with 1 Œºg of Let 126 anti-PR monoclonal antibody and, after incubation for 2 h at 4 ¬∞C, precipitated by rabbit anti-mouse IgG immunoglobulins (Sigma) in excess. Parallel incubations of [35S]SRC-1 with JAB1 in the absence of PR were performed. Nonspecific absorption was then measured by immunoprecipitation with anti-PR antibody. These values were subtracted from the results obtained in presence of [3H]PR. CV-1 cells were transfected as described above with the expression vectors pSG5-PR, pSG5-HA-JAB1, or pSG5-HA-SRC-1 as indicated. The cells were harvested in Laemmli or RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) as indicated, then sonicated, and boiled. The cellular extracts were electrophoresed in Laemmli buffer on 8% polyacrylamide gels. PR, HA-tagged JAB1, and HA-tagged SRC-1 were detected by immunoblotting using either the monoclonal anti-PR antibody Let126 (5 Œºg/ml) (42.Lorenzo F. Jolivet A. Loosfelt H. Vu Hai M.T. Brailly S. Perrot-Applanat M. Milgrom E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 176: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) or the monoclonal anti-HA antibody 12CA5 (2 Œºg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A sheep antimouse horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used at a 1:40,000 dilution as secondary antibody. Bound immunoglobulins were revealed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The amino acid sequence 897‚Äì930 of the PR contains helix 12 of its ligand-binding domain (LBD). This region has been shown to be of great importance in the transcription activation properties of nuclear receptors (43.Xu J. Nawaz Z. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12195-12199Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 44.Nichols M. Rientjes J.M.J. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 765-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 45.Feng W.

Nature. 1998; 393: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). We thus searched for proteins interacting with this region using it as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. PR amino acids 897‚Äì930 were linked to Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Yeast cells were transformed with this plasmid and with a library of placental cDNAs linked to Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD). Reporter genes responsive for Gal4 were present encoding a histidine synthesis enzyme (His3) and an adenine synthesis enzyme (Ade 2). Several cDNA sequences were isolated by their property to allow yeast cells growth in the presence of PR897‚Äì930 and in medium lacking histidine and adenine. They were further studied with the help of a reporter gene encoding Œ≤-galactosidase. Among these clones two corresponded to a fragment of JAB1 as shown by DNA sequencing. JAB1 was cloned in totality, and it was verified that it interacted with PR amino acids 897‚Äì930 in yeast cells (Fig.1 A). It could be argued that the use of a short amino acid segment of a protein does not relate to the physiological situation because this segment might not be accessible in the full-length protein. We thus analyzed the interaction of JAB1 with the totality of PR DBD-LBD (amino acids 547‚Äì930) using the two-hybrid methodology. PR DBD-LBD by itself exerted a hormone-dependent transactivation; however, the latter was markedly enhanced by the addition of ADGal4-JAB1 (Fig. 1 B). This interaction between PR and JAB1 was only observed in the presence of hormone. We then used the in vitro pull-down methodology and the mammalian two-hybrid system to establish that the JAB1-PR interaction was not restricted to yeast. [35S]PR was synthetizedin vitro and incubated with either the fusion protein GST-JAB1 or GST alone. Only the former retained a major fraction of the [35S]PR (Fig. 2). There was no clear effect of the hormone on this interaction. A limited (25%) effect of hormone was observed when using high ratios of [35S]PR versus GST-JAB1. Similar discrepancies in hormone dependence between in vivo experiments andin vitro pull-down experiments have been described for several coactivators and corepressors (13.Hong H. Kohli K. Trivedi A.

Kohli K. Trivedi A. Johnson D.L. Stallcup M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4948-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). The DBDGal4-PR897‚Äì930 construct was cotransfected along with the ADVP16 construct into CV-1 cells with the corresponding reporter gene. A low level of transcription was observed. When the ADVP16-JAB1 (activation domain) construct was cotransfected with the reporter gene, there was a slight increase of the basal level of transcription. However, when DBDGal4-PR897‚Äì930 and ADVP16-JAB1 were cotransfected with the reporter gene, a marked increase in CAT activity was observed, indicating an interaction between PR helix 12 and JAB1. The experiment was repeated with DBDGal4-PR547‚Äì930 corresponding to the DBD-LBD domains of the receptor. A hormone-dependent transactivation of the reporter gene was observed with this construct (Fig. 3 B). It was enhanced by cotransfection with ADVP16-JAB1. The latter interaction was hormone-dependent and was"

This enzyme contains at least two different subunits, named the LCB1 and LCB2 proteins. In the present study, we expressed a FLAG- and His<sub>6</sub> peptide-tagged version of the hamster LCB1 protein in a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant strain lacking the endogenous LCB1 subunit and purified SPT from the cells near to homogeneity by affinity peptide chromatography. The endogenous LCB2 protein was co-purified with the tagged LCB1 protein in purification of SPT. In various aspects, including optimum pH, acyl-CoA specificity, and sphingofungin sensitivity, the activity of purified SPT was consistent with the activity detected in lysates of wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells. The optimum concentration of palmitoyl-CoA for 3-ketodihydrosphingosine formation by purified SPT was ‚àº25 Œºm, and the apparent<i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> of l-serine was 0.28 mm. Competition analysis of the SPT reaction with various serine analogs showed that all of the amino, carboxyl, and hydroxyl groups ofl-serine were responsible for the substrate recognition of the enzyme. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of purified SPT, together with immunoprecipitation analysis of metabolically labeled LCB proteins, strongly suggested that the SPT enzyme consisted of the LCB1 and LCB2 proteins with a stoichiometry of 1:1."

Two-hybrid and glutathioneS-transferase interaction assays show that Hrs1 can associate directly with Cyc8-Tup1.

These observations suggest that Cyc8-Tup1 contacts the Mediator complex via its interaction with the Hrs1 subunit. Further on, genetic analysis indicates that increased Hrs1 dosage can alleviate Cyc8-Tup1-mediated repression, suggesting that Hrs1/Mediator's function is inhibited upon its interaction with Cyc8-Tup1. Finally, artificial holoenzyme recruitment assays support a model by which the contact between the corepressor and the Hrs1/Mediator may prevent pol II holoenzyme recruitment to the core promoter.

It is well established that RNA pol II holoenzyme forms play an important role in transcriptional control (2.Greenblatt J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12.Hanna-Rose W. Hansen U. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 229-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In particular, Srb/Mediator subunits have been identified as the physiologically relevant targets for activator proteins. The potent viral activator VP16 and the yeast activator Gal4 directly interact with specific Srbsin vitro, and these interactions are essential for transcription stimulation in vivo (13.Hengartner C.J.

It is thought that activator-target interactions simply recruit the transcription machinery to the promoter (15.Farrell S. Simkovich N. Wu Y. Barberis A. Ptashne M.

In contrast to transcriptional activators, little is known regarding the molecular function of transcriptional repressors. Specific Srb/Med subcomplexes have been implicated in negative regulation of transcription in both yeast and human systems (7.Sun X. Zhang Y. Cho H. Rickert P. Lees E. Lane W. Reinberg D. Mol.

Qian N. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), yet the mechanism by which the RNA pol II holoenzyme responds to gene-specific repressors and corepressors is poorly understood. The yeast Cyc8(Ssn6)-Tup1 protein complex acts as a general corepressor inhibiting the transcription of a diverse set of genes (23.Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). The corepressor does not bind DNA directly but is recruited to the various promoters via interactions with gene-specific DNA-binding repressor proteins. Recruitment is predominantly mediated by a domain of the Cyc8 subunit (TPR domain), while the repression function is performed by a specific domain of Tup1 (24.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 25.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). An increasing amount of evidence strongly suggests that Tup1-mediated transcriptional repression is performed by two possibly complementary mechanisms. First, Tup1 establishes a repressive chromatin structure over the transcription start point, probably by interacting with histones H3 and H4 (26.Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Second, Tup1 interferes with the function of the RNA pol II holoenzyme; Tup1 represses transcription in the absence of chromatin in an in vitro transcription assay while genetic experiments implicate two distinct groups of holoenzyme subunits (Srb8, Srb9, Srb10, and Srb11; and Sin4, Rgr1, and Rox3) in Cyc8-Tup1-mediated repression (22.Song W. Treich I. Qian N. Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar,27.Chen S. West Jr., R.W. Johnson S.L. Gans H. Kruger B. Ma J. Mol. Cell.

These genetic and biochemical data established a functional connection between the Cyc8-Tup1 complex and the basic transcription machinery, suggesting that the corepressor may target specific component(s) of the RNA pol II holoenzyme. In this paper, using a combination of genetic and biochemical methods, we demonstrate that Cyc8-Tup1 interacts physically with Hrs1/Med3, a subunit of the RNA pol II holoenzyme essential for activated transcription in vitro (11.Myers L.C.

Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). We also provide evidence suggesting that the Cyc8-Tup1 interaction with Hrs1 inhibits Mediator's function and may prevent holoenzyme recruitment to the core promoter. The protease-deficient strain BJ5457 (34.Piruat J.I. Chavez S. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for preparation of protein extracts; all other strains used are derivatives of FT5 (24.Tzamarias D. Struhl K.

Tzamarias D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 205-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The hrs1Œî strain (hrs1ŒîHIS3) was constructed by inserting the HIS3 gene between two internal BamHI sites (codons 95‚Äì342), by one-step gene replacement. A polymerase chain reaction-amplified Hrs1 fragment (from the ATG to the STOP codon) was used for the construction of the hrs1ŒîHIS3allele. Standard synthetic media were used; YP contained 2% glucose or 2% galactose, CS, or CS plus 0.6% casamino acids. pCBG-Cyc8-transformed BJ5457 cells were induced by 0.1 mmCuSO4 (42.Baniahmad C. Baniahmad A. O'Malley B.W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 194-196PubMed Google Scholar). HRS1(NarI-HindIII genomic fragment) was cloned by complementation of the cold-sensitive growth phenotype of thehrs1Œî strain. NH2-terminal deletions of Hrs1 were generated by Bal31 exonuclease and were confirmed by sequencing. Full-length Hrs1 and NH2-terminal deletion derivatives were cloned in to pRSET vectors (Invitrogen). HA-Hrs1 cloned in Ycp91 and LexA-Hrs1 and LexA-Med2 cloned in Ycp91-LexA contain the entire Hrs1 or Med2 coding sequence, respectively (24.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Hrs1-overexpressing plasmid contains the expression cassette of YCp91 in the multicopy plasmid YepLac181 (24.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) derivatives of Cyc8 and Tup1 have been described previously (25.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The SUC2-CYC1 promoter contains the URSSUC2 (‚àí542 to ‚àí392) element cloned in to the SmaI site of the pLGŒî312S plasmid (23.Keleher C.A. Redd M.J. Schultz J. Carlson M. Johnson A.D. Cell. 1992; 68: 709-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). SUC2-lop-His3 was kindly provided by P. Syntyhaki and contains URSSUC2 element in the BamHI site of VS12 (Lop-His3) (24.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged Hrs1 and Cyc8 proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 0,2 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene-sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 4 mm imidazole, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, and were eluted in a buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Histidine-tagged proteins were incubated with 2 Œºg of agarose beads-immobilized GST or GST hybrids in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 4 ¬∞C. Beads were washed in the same buffer, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-His antiserum (Santa Cruz). Cells harboring GST or GST-Cyc8 (pCBG-Cyc8) and HA-Hrs1 expression vectors were lysed, and proteins were extracted as described previously (31.Conlan R.S. Gounalaki N. Hatzis P. Tzamarias D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 205-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The supernatant (‚àº1 mg of protein) was incubated with glutathione-agarose beads, for 2 h, at 4 ¬∞C, and the beads were subsequently washed extensively in the same buffer. GST- or GST-Cyc8-bound proteins were eluted with 1√ó SDS-PAGE sample buffer and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz) and anti-Med2 and anti-Med4 polyclonal antisera, kindly provided by L. Myers. The functional relationship of the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor with the basic transcription machinery led us to the hypothesis that Cyc8-Tup1 might physically contact specific factors of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme. We looked for such protein factors by employing the yeast two-hybrid method for defining protein-protein interactions (33.Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). A chimera consisted of Tup1 and the DNA binding domain of the bacterial LexA protein was expressed in yeast cells along with a plasmid library of short genomic fragments (‚àº500 base pairs) fused to the Gal4 activation domain. Library clones that stimulated transcription from two independent LexA operator-containing promoters were recovered and sequenced. One of the clones that activated transcription over 9-fold (Table I) turned out to contain a region of Hrs1/Med3 (codons 76‚Äì295, Fig. 1), a protein recently identified as a component of the Mediator complex (11.Myers L.C.

To identify the domain of Tup1 that specifically interacts with the Hrs1 protein, and to determine whether this interaction requires Cyc8, various LexA-Tup1 deletion derivatives were tested for two-hybrid interaction with Hrs1 in a cyc8Œî yeast strain (Table I; Fig. 1). LexA-Tup1 and LexA-N200, a Tup1 derivative that contains the repression domain of the protein but lacks the WD40 domain for protein-protein interactions (24.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 35.Komachi K. Johnson A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6023-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), activate transcription when combined with the Gal4-Hrs1 (clone Hrs1 76‚Äì295, Fig. 1). In contrast, the Tup1 derivatives, LexA-N72, which lacks the repression domain and contains only the Cyc8-interaction domain (25.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and LexA-C324, which comprises of the WD40 domain, failed to interact with Hrs1 as they did not activate transcription above the background level. The results of these two-hybrid assays suggest that Hrs1 interacts specifically with the repression domain of Tup1 and that this interaction does not require Cyc8. On the other hand, a LexA-Cyc8 hybrid protein together with Gal4-Hrs1 activated transcription of the reporter promoter in atup1Œî strain (Table I), indicating that Cyc8 interacts independently with Hrs1 in vivo. Taken together, the above results suggest that the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor targets the Mediator complex via independent interactions of its components with the Hrs1 protein. In order to determine whether the two-hybrid interactions reflected direct protein contacts, we tested whether Hrs1 associates with Tup1 and Cyc8 in the absence of any other yeast protein (Fig.2 A). Histidine-tagged Hrs1 protein (residues 1‚Äì431, Fig. 1) was purified from E. coliand was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads containing GST, GST-Cyc8/N405 (TPR domain), or GST-Tup1/N200 (Tup1 repression domain). In accordance with the results obtained in the two-hybrid assays, both GST-Cyc8 and GST-Tup1, but not GST alone, interacted with the Hrs1 protein in vitro. A deletion derivative of Hrs1, which lacks the first 83 NH2-terminal residues (C347, Fig. 1) but contains most of the Hrs1 76‚Äì295 sequence that was isolated in the two-hybrid screen, also interacted with GST-Tup1 and GST-Cyc8, whereas a smaller derivative (C243, Fig. 1), which lacks the first 196 residues, did not interact with either Tup1 or Cyc8 proteins. These results indicate that an internal region of Hrs1 (residues 84‚Äì196) is responsible for the interaction with the repression domain of Tup1 as well as with the TPR region of Cyc8. To test whether Hrs1 can interact with the Cyc8-Tup1 protein complex, an excess amount of histidine-tagged Cyc8 (N405) protein (Fig.2 B, input lane 1) was pre-incubated with glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-Tup1 and subsequently Hrs1 protein was added (input lane 2). GST-Tup1 associated with Cyc8 (lane 3) and Hrs1 bound stably to the pre-formed GST-Tup1/Cyc8 complex (lane 4). These results clearly show that, although both subunits can separately associate with the Hrs1 protein, strong interaction with Hrs1 is also accomplished by the functional form of the corepressor, the Cyc8-Tup1 protein complex. In order to test whether Cyc8-Tup1 can contact the Hrs1 subunit when the latter is assembled in the Mediator complex, protein extracts were prepared from yeast cells expressing an influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged Hrs1 protein along with either GST or a GST-Cyc8 hybrid protein and were subjected to GST affinity chromatography. Proteins that co-purified with GST-Cyc8 or with GST alone were further analyzed by immunoblotting using a monoclonal anti-HA antibody and polyclonal antisera raised against the Mediator proteins Med4 and Med2 (a kind gift from L. Myers). As shown in Fig.2 C, a fraction of HA-Hrs1 was retained together with GST-Cyc8, but not with GST, in the glutathione-Sepharose column. Moreover, Med4 and Med2 proteins were also retained along with GST-Cyc8. In contrast, in extracts obtained from a hrs1Œî strain, GST-Cyc8 did not co-purify with either Med4 or Med2 proteins. Previous analysis (32.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) has revealed that Med2 and Hrs1, along with Sin4, Rgr1, and Gal11, form a Mediator subcomplex that is distinct from Med4 and additional Med/Srb subunits. Thus, it is possible that Cyc8-Tup1 contacts the entire Mediator complex via its interaction with the Hrs1 subunit. Substantial lines of evidence indicate that the Mediator subunit Hrs1 plays a positive role in transcription. It is essential for activated transcription by Gcn4 or VP16 in vitro (32.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and for transcriptional stimulation of various yeast genes in vivo (34.Piruat J.I. Chavez S. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, expression of Cyc8-Tup1-regulated genes is defective inhrs1Œî strains (34.Piruat J.I. Chavez S. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 2D. Tzamarias, unpublished observations. indicating that Hrs1 is required for normal transcription of this class of genes as well. We reasoned that the positive function of Hrs1 might be inhibited upon interaction with the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor under repressive conditions. In such case, an increased Hrs1 concentration in vivo could possibly overcome Cyc8-Tup1-mediated repression function. In order to test this hypothesis, a specific SUC2 promoter element (URSSUC2) that contains binding sites for Mig1/Mig2, two Cyc8-Tup1-dependent DNA-binding repressor proteins (25.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 821-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar,36.Song W. Carlson M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5757-5765Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 37.Nehlin J.O. Ronne H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2891-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 38.Treitel M.A. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3132-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), was inserted upstream of a CYC1-LacZ reporter promoter and Œ≤-galactosidase activity was analyzed in yeast strains expressing either normal or high levels of Hrs1 (Fig.3 A). SUC2-CYC1-LacZexpressed 10-fold lower Œ≤-galactosidase activity than the controlCYC1-LacZ reporter, indicating that URSSUC2inhibits transcription. This inhibitory effect is mediated by Cyc8-Tup1, since deletion of the chromosomal TUP1 locus (tup1Œî strain) completely alleviated URSSUC2-dependent repression. High levels of Hrs1 (H-Hrs1) in a wild-type strain grown in glucose media (repression conditions) increased transcription from the SUC2-CYC1promoter 5-fold, while expression of the CYC1-LacZ control reporter was not affected. In contrast, overexpression of Hrs1 in atup1Œî strain did not further increase transcription from the SUC2-CYC1 promoter. We should note that Hrs1 overexpression does not significantly affect the corepressor's protein levels, as a GST-Cyc8 hybrid protein is equally stable in cells expressing either normal or high amount of Hrs1 protein (Fig.3 E). Hrs1 overexpression affected transcription of ANB1, another Cyc8-Tup1-repressible gene, in a similar manner (Fig. 3 B).ANB1 is not expressed in wild-type cells but is constitutively de-repressed in cells carrying the tup1Œî mutation. Hrs1 elevated levels completely de-repressed ANB1transcription in wild-type cells, whereas they had no further effect in cells carrying the tup1Œî mutation. Moreover, Hrs1-overexpressing cells exhibit slow growth and constitutive flocculation, phenotypes, which resemble (in some degree) to the ones of cyc8Œî or tup1Œî cells (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, Hrs1 overexpression increases transcription of FLO11, a distinct Cyc8-Tup1-regulated gene involved in flocculation and pseudohyphal growth (Fig. 3 B). These observations indicate that large amounts of Hrs1 weaken the function of the corepressor on additional repressible genes. On the contrary, overexpression of Hrs1-associated Mediator subunits, such as Sin4 and Med2, did not affect the repression function of Cyc8-Tup1 (data not shown). In order to see whether high levels of Hrs1 overcome repression by masking the Cyc8-Tup1 protein complex, we tested a truncated Hrs1 derivative (Hrs1-N315, Fig. 1), which lacks a small COOH-terminal region but contains the Cyc8-Tup1 interaction region. Overexpression of Hrs1-N315 did not de-repress SUC2 or ANB1transcription (Fig. 3, A and C) and did not cause flocculent or slow growth phenotypes (data not shown), although it was stably expressed in vivo (Fig. 3 D) and is capable to interact with the corepressor. Hrs1-N315 does not support normal activated transcription in vivo, 3T. Copf and D. Tzamarias, unpublished observations. indicating that de-repression of Cyc8-Tup1-regulated genes requires overexpression of a functional Hrs1 protein. Based on the above results, we consider it unlikely that Hrs1 overexpression de-represses transcription by simply masking the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor. To test whether Hrs1 overexpression increases transcription of Cyc8-Tup1-regulated genes specifically, we examined the expression level of three additional promoters that are not regulated by Cyc8-Tup1: GAL1, HIS3, and TPS2 genes, which are induced by galactose, amino acid depletion, and high concentration of salt, respectively (Fig.4). In contrast to Cyc8-Tup1-regulated genes (SUC2, ANB1, or FLO11), overexpression of Hrs1 did not result in a further increase of either basal (white bars) or induced levels (black bars) of GAL1, HIS3, or TPS2 gene transcription. In conclusion, our results clearly indicate that Hrs1 is a limiting factor only for the transcription of Cyc8-Tup1-regulated genes and only upon repression (e.g. in a wild-type, not in atup1Œî strain), suggesting that its function and consequently the function of the Mediator may be inhibited upon interaction with the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor. It was proposed that activation domains, via interactions with Srb/Med proteins, promote the rate of pol II holoenzyme recruitment to a promoter (14.Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We reasoned that Cyc8-Tup1, through its contacts with Hrs1, might antagonize the function of activators thereby preventing pol II holoenzyme recruitment. Therefore, we examined whether Cyc8-Tup1 repression could be bypassed by directly recruiting the pol II holoenzyme to the DNA template independently of activators. It has been previously shown that tethering a holoenzyme component to a DNA-binding protein, such as LexA, is sufficient to activate transcription from a LexA operator containing reporter promoter, as the tethered holoenzyme protein apparently recruits the remaining transcription machinery to the core promoter (16.Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, LexA fused to Hrs1 or Med2 proteins strongly activated transcription from Lop-His3, a LexA operator containing promoter (Fig.5 A, gray bars), in a manner comparable to the potent activation domain of a LexA-Gal4 hybrid protein. Direct holoenzyme recruitment bypassed the repression effect of the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor, as LexA-Hrs1 or LexA-Med2 hybrids strongly stimulated transcription from a SUC2-lop-His3 reporter promoter that contains the Cyc8-Tup1-repressible URSSUC2element upstream of a LexA operator (Fig. 5, A andD, black bars). In contrast, activation by LexA-Gal4, which presumably recruits the RNA pol II holoenzyme through interactions with Mediator subunits (14.Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), was inhibited by Cyc8-Tup1 (Fig. 5, B and C). Thus, we conclude that Cyc8-Tup1 may prevent pol II holoenzyme recruitment probably by precluding interactions between activator proteins and components of the Mediator complex. In this report we identified the Hrs1/Med3 subunit of the RNA pol II holoenzyme as a physical target of the general corepressor complex Cyc8-Tup1. We first isolated Hrs1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen, based on its ability to interact with Tup1. Furthermore, by using recombinant proteins and an in vitro interaction assay, we showed that Hrs1 associates physically with Cyc8-Tup1 in the absence of any other yeast protein. It is thought that Hrs1 occupies a peripheral location in the Mediator complex (11.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 32.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 39.Li Y. Jorklund S.B. Jiang Y.W. Kim Y.J. Lane W.S. Stillman D.J. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10864-10868Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar); therefore, it is conceivable that such a location makes it accessible for interaction with promoter specific regulators as the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor. Besides Hrs1, Cyc8-Tup1 co-purifies with at least two additional Mediator subunits, Med2 and Med4, but still in a Hrs1-dependent manner. It is noteworthy that Med2 associates with Hrs1, Sin4, Rgr1, and Gal11 in a Mediator subassembly distinct from Med4 and the remaining Srb/Med components (32.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Thus, although interactions between Cyc8-Tup1 and additional Mediator subunits cannot be excluded, our data suggest that Cyc8-Tup1 contacts the Mediator complex primarily by a direct interaction with the Hrs1 subunit. Two lines of evidence support the physiological relevance of the corepressor-Hrs1 interaction for transcriptional repression. First, Hrs1 is targeted by the Tup1 repression domain, which is essential for repression of all known Cyc8-Tup1-regulated genes (24.Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Second, Hrs1 overexpression either increases (SUC2-CYC1) or completely de-represses (ANB1) transcription of Cyc8-Tup1-repressible promoters under repressive conditions. Based on these observations and the fact that Hrs1 is essential for transcription of various yeast genes including Cyc8-Tup1-regulated ones (32.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34.Piruat J.I. Chavez S. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar),2 we propose that the corepressor inhibits the positive function of the Hrs1/Mediator. We should note that, in contrast to the majority of the Mediator polypeptides that are present in roughly equal concentrations, Hrs1 and associated components form a distinct subassembly that is present in a lower and probably limiting amount (only 30‚Äì50%) relative to the remaining Mediator subunits (11.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Bushnell D.A. Lui M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Kornberg R.D. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that higher Hrs1 dosage overcomes repression by Cyc8-Tup1 by increasing the Hrs1-containing fraction of the pol II holoenzyme that is competent for transcription initiation. Based on artificial pol II holoenzyme recruitment assays, Fig. 5illustrates a possible mechanism by which Cyc8-Tup1 exerts its repression function. Transcription activation by LexA-Gal4 (Fig.5 B), which predominantly functions by recruiting the RNA pol II holoenzyme to the promoter (16.Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), is inhibited by the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor (Fig. 5 C). However, transcriptional activation by direct pol II holoenzyme recruitment (through LexA-Med hybrids; Fig.5 D) bypasses Cyc8-Tup1 repression. Thus, it is likely that Cyc8-Tup1 interferes with the recruitment of the pol II holoenzyme to the core promoter. One possibility is that attachment of Cyc8-Tup1 to the pol II holoenzyme via Hrs1 precludes specific interactions between Srb/Mediator subunits and activator proteins or between different holoenzyme subunits. In support to this notion, Mediator complexes lacking Hrs1 do not support Gal4-mediated activation in vivo (32.Myers L.C. Gustafsson C.M. Hayashibara K.C. Brown P.O. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 67-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34.Piruat J.I. Chavez S. Aguilera A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1585-1594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although they retain the Srb4 polypeptide, the physical target for the Gal4 activator protein (14.Koh S.S. Ansari A.Z. Ptashne M. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 40.Lee Y.C. Min S. Gim B.S. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4622-4632Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the corepressor-Hrs1 interaction might inhibit function(s) of the pol II holoenzyme Mediator complex as yet unidentified. For example, it has been reported that TATA-binding protein occupancy in vivo, which is eventually prevented by Cyc8-Tup1 and is stimulated by activator proteins, requires the concerted function of the RNA pol II holoenzyme (41.Kuras L. Struhl K. Nature. 1999; 399: 609-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). It is possible that Cyc8-Tup1 by contacting Hrs1 interferes with a functional interaction between the RNA pol II holoenzyme and transcription factor IID, thereby preventing TATA-binding protein binding to the TATA element. We cannot exclude the possibility that Hrs1 and associated factors are functionally related to Srb10/Srb11, which are required for complete Cyc8-Tup1-mediated repression (30.Kuchin S. Carlson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, Hrs1 overexpression alleviates Cyc8-Tup1 repression, even in a strain that lacks Srb10 kinase activity (data not shown) suggesting that Hrs1 and Srb10/Srb11 may independently contribute to transcriptional repression. Tup1 contacts multiple targets; Roth and colleagues have shown previously that the Tup1 repression domain interacts in vitro with the NH2-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4 (26.Edmondson D.G. Smith M.M. Roth S.Y. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1247-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 43.Zhang L.W. Roth S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6555-6562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Cyc8-Tup1 may establish a repressive chromatin structure. While it seems likely that multiple corepressor-target interactions cooperate to elicit high levels of repression, it is not yet clear whether the interactions observed with isolated proteins (Hrs1, H3, H4) are required for repression of all Cyc8-Tup1-regulated genes and whether they occur simultaneously during the repression process. It is possible that the Cyc8-Tup1 corepressor initiates repression by inhibiting the function of the pol II holoenzyme via its interaction with Hrs1, while it subsequently maintains this repressive state by organizing chromatin.

We observed that thermosensitive mex67-5 cells do not produce a heat shock response at 37 ¬∞C but will induce heat shock proteins (Hsp) (e.g. Hsp104p and Hsp70p) when shifted back from the restrictive to permissive temperature (30 ¬∞C). This memory of a previous heat stress in mex67-5 cells could be explained ifHSP mRNAs accumulated inside the nucleus during heat shock and were exported and translated in the cytoplasm on return to the permissive temperature. To test this hypothesis, nuclear export of heat shock mRNAs was directly analyzed by in situhybridization using fluorescent-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for SSA transcripts. This revealed that Mex67p is required for nuclear export of heat shock mRNAs.

Besides transport receptors, Ran and its modulating factors are essentially involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, acting as a molecular switch for the vectorial transport of many if not all of the transport routes across the nuclear membrane (1.Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 5.Cole C.N. Hammell C.M. Curr.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The export of different RNA transcripts from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is a major transport activity of the nuclear pores. If one assumes that of the 6,000 yeast genes on average 10‚Äì50 copies of a given mRNA are present in the cytoplasm and that the half-life of a transcript is in the 15-min range, 10,000 mRNA transcripts have to be exported to the cytoplasm per min. By taking into account that a yeast cell has about 150 NPCs, this translates to about 50‚Äì250 transcripts per pore per min. Furthermore, about 10‚Äì20 ribosomal subunits and probably 10‚Äì50 times more tRNAs are estimated to exit every minute through each nuclear pore. This shows that the NPCs have a high export capacity for the different classes of RNAs that are transcribed, processed, modified, and assembled inside the nucleus. Many components that play a role in RNA export have been characterized. In yeast, mutants defective in mRNA export have largely been identified by screening for nuclear accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA using in situ hybridization with fluorescent-labeled oligo(dT) probes (8.Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1173-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 9.Kadowaki T. Chen S. Hitomi M. Jacobs E. Kumagai C. Liang S. Schneiter R. Singleton D. Wisniewska J. Tartakoff A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This revealed that nucleoporins, shuttling transport factors, human ribonucleoprotein proteins, helicases, and exonucleases are crucially involved in poly(A)+ RNA export (reviewed in Ref. 10.Fabre E. Hurt E. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1997; 31: 277-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). More recently, these analyses have been extended to follow the nuclear exit of individual mRNA transcripts using in situ hybridization. However, this required overexpression of the corresponding genes from high copy number plasmids to increase the level of transcripts in the cell. Among the transcripts analyzed so far were mRNAs encoding the abundant heat shock proteins (11.Saavedra C. Tung K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopper A.K. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 12.Saavedra C.A. Hammell C.M. Heath C.V. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and a low abundance transcription factor, Ash1p. Interestingly, it was shown that the ASH1mRNA is further transported within the cytoplasm to the bud tip along actin fibers with the help of a myosin motor (13.Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I. Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P. Science. 1997; 277: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Two of the essential mRNA export factors in yeast are Mex67p and its associated co-factor Mtr2p (14.Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. LuÃàhrmann R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 15.Santos-Rosa H. Moreno H. Simos G. Segref A. Fahrenkrog B. PanteÃÅ N. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6826-6838Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The mammalian counterpart of the Mex67p-Mtr2p complex is called the TAP-p15 complex and is also implicated in nuclear exit of poly(A)+ RNA (16.Katahira J. StraÃàŒ≤er K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.J. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The human TAP-p15 complex was able to complement the otherwise non-viablemex67/mtr2 null mutant (16.Katahira J. StraÃàŒ≤er K. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Jung J.J. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2593-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), demonstrating that these are orthologs. The thermosensitive mex67-5 mutant revealed a rapid accumulation of poly(A)+ RNA inside the nucleus after shift to the restrictive temperature, suggesting that nuclear mRNA export is promptly inhibited. This analysis did not, however, determine whether the mex67-5 mutation reduces the export of all mRNAs or strongly inhibits the nuclear exit of specific mRNA transcripts. We therefore analyzed the nuclear export of heat shock mRNAs in mex67-5 cells at the restrictive temperature either indirectly by pulse labeling of heat shock proteins with [35S]methionine followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography or directly by in situ hybridization using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides specific for SSA transcripts. We further probed mex67-5 cells with antisense probes specific for ASH1 and PGK1, two other PolII transcripts. All this showed that Mex67p is an essential nuclear export factor for all three tested polymerase II-derived mRNA transcripts. Yeast strains used in this work are shown in Table I. Microbiological techniques, plasmid transformation, and plasmid recovery were done essentially as described earlier (14.Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. LuÃàhrmann R. Hurt E.C.

The cultures were further incubated for 10 min at the previous temperature, before cells were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed in 50 Œºl of SDS sample buffer using the glass beads lysis method. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography as described (19.Tollervey D. Lehtonen H. Jansen R.P. Kern H. Hurt E.C.

They were diluted to an optical density of 0.2 in YPD medium and further grown to an optical density of 0.4, before half of each culture was shifted for 50 min to 37 ¬∞C, whereas the other half was left at 23 ¬∞C. Both cultures (23 and 37 ¬∞C grown) were then shifted for 10 min to 52 ¬∞C, before 10‚àí1 step dilutions were plated on YPD plates.

Aliquots corresponding to 6 √ó 108cells were removed before temperature shift at 10-min intervals. Cells were immediately fixed with 4% formaldehyde, washed after fixation, and spheroplasted with oxalyticase. After adhering spheroplasts to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, the cells were hybridized overnight in 2√ó SSC, 40% formamide, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 20 mm ribonucleoside vanadyl complex, and 2 Œºg/ml labeled oligonucleotide probes. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech (Germany). The oligonucleotides that were used for detection ofSSA1, SSA2, and SSA3 transcripts are described below. Oligonucleotides were chosen to hybridize to regions within SSA mRNAs that show high sequence similarity between the three sequences. The oligonucleotides chosen are as follows: oligonucleotide SSA1-1, GGTT*GACCAATCTGTT*GTCAAAATCTT*CACCACCCAAAT*GGGTGT*CACCA; oligonucleotide SSA1-2, AAT*AGCAGCTT*GAACAGCAGCACCGT*AAGCAACAGCT*TCATCTGGGT*; and oligonucleotide PGK1, CCGGCAGCACGT*TGTGGCAAGT*CGAAACCGACCAT*AGAAGAGT*GAGCTCT*; T* corresponds to an amino-modified T that was covalently coupled to the fluorochrome CY3 as described (22.Long R.M.

The fast onset of this phenotype suggested that mRNA export is rapidly inhibited in the mex67-5 strain at the non-permissive temperature. We have taken advantage of this observation to test the export of the heat shock-inducible transcripts. If the nuclear exit of these mRNAs is efficiently blocked in themex67-5 cells following transfer from 30 ¬∞C (permissive temperature) to 37 ¬∞C (restrictive for mex67-5 cells and inductive for the heat shock response pathway), heat shock proteins should not be translated in the cytoplasm. In contrast, if Mex67p is not required for the nuclear exit of heat shock mRNAs or the export defect is only partial, it should be possible to follow the induction of heat shock proteins in mex67-5 cells at the restrictive temperature by metabolic pulse labeling. To test these possibilities,mex67-5 and wild-type cells were shifted from 30 to 37 ¬∞C, and the induction of the major heat shock proteins (e.g. Hsp70p and Hsp104p) was measured by pulse-labeling cells with [35S]methionine followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. MEX67+ cells exhibit the expected strong induction of the major heat shock proteins Hsp104p, Hsp90p, Hsp70p (Ssa1p, Ssa2p, Ssa3p, and Ssa4p), and Hsp58p after a 15-min shift to 37 ¬∞C, which gradually disappeared when the duration of the heat shock was extended (Fig.1 A) (20.Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In contrast, no significant induction of the major heat shock proteins was observed when the mex67-5 strain was shifted to 37 ¬∞C for 15 min (Fig. 1 A). All this indicates that export of all of the major heat shock inducible mRNAs is strongly inhibited in themex67-5 strain after shift to 37 ¬∞C. If not only heat shock mRNA, but also bulk mRNA is impaired in nuclear exit in mex67-5 cells, de novo synthesis of proteins should gradually decrease during incubation at the restrictive temperature. Indeed, incorporation of [35S]methionine into newly synthesized proteins decreases significantly during the first 3 h of incubation at the restrictive temperature in mex67-5 cells but not inMEX67+ cells (Fig. 1 B, see also Fig.1 C). This suggests that bulk mRNA export is blocked inmex67-5 cells, and due to the time-dependent cytoplasmic degradation of mRNA a gradual inhibition of protein synthesis takes place. Other yeast mutants reported to exhibit nuclear transport defects were also tested for the induction of heat shock proteins at the restrictive temperature.

In each of these strains substantial synthesis of heat shock proteins was observed at the restrictive temperature (Fig.1 C). The nsp1-5 strain was reported to have a nuclear protein import defect, whereas the nup85Œî (8.Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N.

Tartakoff A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 649-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) mutants exhibit a less strong mRNA export defect with a delayed onset compared with mex67-5. There appears to be a good correlation between the nuclear poly(A)+ RNA accumulation and heat shock mRNA export phenotypes. To show in a different way that mRNA export is immediately inhibited in mex67-5 cells after shift to 37 ¬∞C, a time course of nuclear poly(A)+ RNA export was performed usingin situ hybridization with fluorescently labeled oligo(dT) probes. This revealed that export of bulk poly(A)+ RNA must be very strongly inhibited in mex67-5 cells, since the cytoplasmic poly(A)+ RNA pool begins to decrease already after a 5-min shift to 37 ¬∞C and is further diminished within 1 h of incubation at the restrictive temperature (Fig.2). Concomitantly, after 5 min incubation at 37 ¬∞C, poly(A)+ RNA begins to accumulate inside the nucleus in mex67-5 cells (Fig. 2). This shows that nuclear export of bulk poly(A)+ RNA is immediately and strongly inhibited in mex67-5 cells after shift to the restrictive temperature. Exposure of yeast cells to a brief, non-lethal heat shock (e.g.37 ¬∞C) induces heat shock proteins and allows them to survive temperatures (e.g. 52 ¬∞C) that are otherwise lethal (20.Nicolet C.M. Craig E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since mex67-5 cells failed to induce heat shock proteins at 37 ¬∞C, we predicted that mex67-5 cells are more efficiently killed at 52 ¬∞C, even if they have gone through a non-lethal incubation at 37 ¬∞C. Isogenic mex67-5 andMEX67+ strains were grown at room temperature before the cultures were split; one-half was directly shifted for 10 min to 52 ¬∞C, whereas the other half was incubated for 50 min at 37 ¬∞C, before a 10-min shift to 52 ¬∞C. Cells were plated at 23 ¬∞C, and the survival rate was measured. This revealed thatMEX67+ cells were much better protected against a killing heat shock at 52 ¬∞C (about 50-fold) thanmex67-5 cells (about 8-fold), when previously exposed to 37 ¬∞C (Table II). The lack of the heat shock response observed in mex67-5 cells therefore correlates with a decreased thermotolerance when briefly exposed to killing temperatures.Table IImex67‚Äì5 cells exhibit a strongly reduced thermotoleranceMEX67+ 23 > 52 ¬∞CMEX67+ 23 > 37 > 52 ¬∞Cmex67‚Äì5 23 > 52 ¬∞Cmex67‚Äì5 23 > 37 > 52 ¬∞C1:10282>10,00029817301:100362050282281:100084565231:1000006606Thermotolerance in MEX67 + and mex67‚Äì5cells was analyzed according to Ref. 20.Nicolet C.M.

Craig E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar and as described under ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures.‚Äù To test whether another heat-inducible mRNA not encoding a heat shock protein is translatable inmex67-5 cells at the restrictive temperature, a hybrid gene was made consisting of the SSA4 promoter fused to the open reading frame encoding GFP-Nup49p (see ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures‚Äù). This SSA4::GFP-NUP49 construct was inserted into an ARS/CEN/ADE2 plasmid and transformed intomex67-5 and isogenic MEX67+ cells. Cells were grown at permissive temperature (23 ¬∞C) or shifted for 15 min to 39 ¬∞C before whole cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using antibodies against GFP (Fig. 3). GFP-Nup49p was expressed only at low levels in wild-type cells at 23 ¬∞C but was strongly induced under the control of theSSA4 promoter by shifting cells for 15 min to 39 ¬∞C (Fig.3, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast,mex67-5 cells do not reveal induction of GFP-Nup49p translation at 39 ¬∞C (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4); the basal expression of GFP-Nup49p was, however, enhanced at 23 ¬∞C as compared with wild-type cells (see also ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù). The possibility remained that the lack of heat shock response in mex67-5 strains was due to the inhibition of heat shock mRNA induction or mRNA instability. This question was addressed by Northern analysis using probes specific for the SSA1 and SSA4 transcripts (Fig. 4). SSA1 andSSA4 were expressed at similar, low levels in the mutant and wild-type at 23 ¬∞C (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 7). Following transfer to 42 ¬∞C, SSA1 and SSA4were strongly and comparably induced in bothMEX67+ and mex67-5 cells (Fig. 4, compare lanes 1 and 7 with lanes 2 and8). The degradation of the SSA1 andSSA4 mRNAs was monitored during a time course following transcription inhibition with thiolutin and transfer to 37 ¬∞C (Fig.4, lanes 3‚Äì6, and lanes 9‚Äì12). Decay of both mRNAs was slightly slower in the mex67-5 strain than in the MEX67+ strain, possibly reflecting differences between the nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA degradation pathways. When cells were transferred directly from 23 to 37 ¬∞C, lower induction was observed for both strains but was similar for theMEX67+ and mex67-5 cells (data not shown). We conclude that the failure of mex67-5 cells to produce the major heat shock proteins at 37 ¬∞C or higher temperatures is not due to the inhibition of synthesis or instability of the mRNAs and is therefore most likely due to inhibition of nuclear export of heat shock mRNAs. If the heat shock mRNAs accumulated inside the nucleus inmex67-5 cells at the restrictive temperature, it seemed possible that they would be exported, following shift of the cells to the permissive temperature. Moreover, the mex67-5 mutant is highly thermoreversible for growth (14.Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. LuÃàhrmann R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and the decay of accumulated heat shock mRNAs is not too fast in mex67-5 strain at 37 ¬∞C (see Fig. 4). As shown above, mex67-5 cells do not significantly induce the major heat shocks proteins Hsp70p and Hsp104p when shifted for 15 min to 37 ¬∞C or higher temperatures (e.g. 39 ¬∞C). However, when the mex67-5 cells were returned to 30 ¬∞C for 20 min, induction of Hsp104p and Hsp70p was observed (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, MEX67+ cells exhibited a strong heat shock response at 39 ¬∞C, and the major heat shock proteins gradually disappeared upon a 20-min incubation time at the permissive temperature (Fig. 5 A). To exclude that de novo transcription of SSA mRNA occurred in mex67-5 cells when shifted from restrictive to permissive conditions, the PolII inhibitor thiolutin was added to the cells after heat shock to stop any PolII transcription in the following permissive phase. Basically, the same results were obtained in the presence of thiolutin, and Hsp104p and Ssa proteins were clearly induced during incubation of mex67-5 cells at the permissive temperature (Fig. 5 B). However, it is clear that the reversal of the export block is not complete, since the newly synthesized heat shock proteins in mex67-5 cells when shifted from 39 to 30 ¬∞C is less strong as compared with wild-type cells shifted to 39 ¬∞C. This suggests a certain amount of mRNA turnover inside the nucleus during the period of heat stress inmex67-5 cells. We conclude that mRNAs encoding Ssa1‚Äì4p proteins and Hsp104p accumulate inside the nucleus ofmex67-5 cells at the restrictive temperature but can be partly exported into the cytoplasm and translated into heat shock proteins, when the cells are returned to the permissive temperature. To demonstrate that SSA mRNAs accumulate in the nucleus in the mex67-5 mutant at the non-permissive temperature, in situ hybridization against SSA transcripts was performed before and after temperature shift of wild-type, mex67-5, and nsp1-5 cells. For SSA mRNA detection, CY3-coupled antisense oligonucleotides were chosen that hybridize to sequences in the SSA1, SSA2, andSSA3 transcripts (see ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures‚Äù). This oligonucleotide-based hybridization procedure has previously been reported to detect only the corresponding mRNA targets (22.Long R.M. Elliott D.J. Stutz F. Rosbash M. Singer R.H. RNA (NY). 1995; 1: 1071-1078PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type cells (Fig. 6A,MEX67 + ) showed a weak and diffuse cytoplasmic in situ signal for SSA transcripts when grown at 25 ¬∞C. This corresponds to the low abundance ofSSA transcripts in cells grown at non-heat shock conditions (see also Fig. 4). The cytoplasmic in situ signal forSSA transcripts significantly increased after cells were shifted to 38 ¬∞C, and no nuclear staining was seen. This is consistent with previous findings that heat shock mRNAs are efficiently exported from the nucleus at elevated temperatures (e.g. 42 ¬∞C) (11.Saavedra C. Tung K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopper A.K. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In mex67-5 cells an increased SSA in situ signal is seen at 25 ¬∞C compared with the wild type. This possibly reflects the partial induction of a stress pathway in mex67-5 cells at the permissive temperature due to the mex67-5 mutation (see also Fig. 3,lanes 3 and 4). When mex67-5 cells were shifted to 38 ¬∞C for 10‚Äì20 min, the cytoplasmic in situ signal did not increase, but instead SSA mRNAs rapidly accumulated inside the nucleus, indicating a failure ofSSA mRNA export (Fig. 6 A,mex67-5). Strikingly, the intranuclear heat shock mRNA signal was concentrated in several discrete spots, which varied in number, as described previously for bulk poly(A)+ RNA (14.Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. LuÃàhrmann R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). No clear defect in the export of the heat shock mRNAs was observed in a strain carrying a thermosensitive mutation in the nucleoporin Nsp1p (Fig. 6 A, nsp1-5). We wanted to test whether other PolII transcripts are also blocked in nuclear export in the mex67-5 strain. Specifically, we were interested to see whether not only the abundant SSAtranscripts, but a rare and cell cycle-regulated mRNA is exported by Mex67p. We chose ASH1 as a reporter transcript, which encodes a daughter cell-specific transcriptional repressor, whose mRNA is transcribed only in cells that have completed anaphase (26.Bobola N. Jansen R.P. Shin T.H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1996; 84: 699-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). It was recently shown that theASH1 mRNA transiently accumulates at the tip of the large bud and serves as a localized source for Ash1p protein synthesis (13.Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I. Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P. Science. 1997; 277: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In the wild-type and nsp1-5 strains, post-anaphase cells show a bud tip localized signal for ASH1 mRNA at both 23 and 38 ¬∞C (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, theASH1 mRNA accumulates inside the nucleus of both mother and daughter mex67-5 cells shifted to 38 ¬∞C for 10‚Äì20 min, and the bud-specific signal was completely absent (Fig.6 B). Nuclear ASH1 transcripts also accumulate in spots located close to the nuclear periphery but less pronounced as compared with SSA mRNAs. Finally, a third mRNA transcript corresponding to an abundant glycolytic enzyme (phosphoglycerate kinase) was tested in this assay. As revealed byin situ hybridization, also PGK1 mRNAs encoding phosphoglycerate kinase accumulate inside the nucleus inmex67-5 cells when shifted to the non-permissive temperature (Fig. 6 C). In summary, the low abundance, cell cycle-regulated ASH1mRNA and the abundant mRNAs encoding the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase and HSP70 proteins accumulate inside the nucleus in mex67-5 cells at the restrictive temperature. Mex67p is therefore a nuclear export factor for different types of mRNA transcripts. In the thermosensitive mex67-5 mutant strains the major heat shock proteins including the Hsp70p family and Hsp104p are no longer synthesized under conditions of heat shock induction. In consequence, mex67-5 cells show a strongly decreased thermotolerance. By using a variety of different assays, we have shown that Mex67p is required for the nuclear export of the heat shock mRNAs. The inhibition of export of the heat shock mRNAs to the cytoplasm in mex67-5 cells at 37 ¬∞C is responsible for the lack of a heat shock response. Strikingly, the heat shock proteins were partly induced when the mex67-5 strain was returned from heat shock conditions to the permissive temperature. We assume that this is due to the transport and translation of the ‚Äústored‚Äù nuclear heat shock mRNAs. It has been demonstrated previously that the mex67-5 mutant is highly thermoreversible (14.Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. LuÃàhrmann R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The accumulated heat shock mRNAs in mex67-5 cells thus do not represent a dead-end product but rather a functional intermediate, which can be chased into the cytoplasm upon transfer to permissive temperatures. Thus, nuclear export of mRNA does not require ongoing PolII transcription. The inhibition of the heat shock proteins is readily detected by pulse labeling with [35S]methionine followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. This provides a simple assay that could be applied to other mutants with potential mRNA export defects. It is predicted that nuclear export mutants with a fast and complete onset of intranuclear mRNA accumulation (within the range of a few minutes after shift to the restrictive temperature) will not express heat shock proteins. Previous estimates of the severity of mRNA export mutant have generally been based on in situ hybridization using probes for poly(A)+ RNA. However, the level of residual mRNA export in these mutants was difficult to evaluate. With the assay described here, it is possible to estimate in a semi-quantitative way how efficiently mRNA export is blocked, simply by measuringde novo synthesis of heat shock proteins (by pulse labeling) or other SSA4 promoter-dependent reporter constructs (e.g. GFP-Nup49p; by Western blotting). Other yeast mutants, which gave a weaker nuclear poly(A)+ RNA accumulation, did not show a clear inhibition of heat shock protein induction at 37 ¬∞C. Thus, in contrast to mex67-5 cells,nup85Œî and rat2-1 cells apparently are not tightly blocked in heat shock mRNA export within the first 15‚Äì30 min after shift to the restrictive temperature. Although several mRNA export factors have been identified, it is not known whether they function for all yeast mRNA transcripts or are specialized for different types of mRNAs. Interesting in this context is the report that heat-inducible SSA1 andSSA4 mRNAs are exported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm at heat shock temperatures (e.g. 42 ¬∞C), whereas the bulk of poly(A)+ RNA is not exported and accumulates inside the nucleus (11.Saavedra C. Tung K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopper A.K. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, theSSA1/SSA4 mRNA export is not Ran-dependent as mutants of the Ran cycle can still export heat shock mRNAs at 42 ¬∞C. However, the nucleoporin Rip1p, which is dispensable for cell growth, and Gle1p, a nuclear export sequence-containing mRNA export factor, were found to be important for nuclear export of heat shock mRNAs (12.Saavedra C.A. Hammell C.M. Heath C.V. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2845-2856Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 27.Stutz F. Kantor J. Zhang D. McCarthy T. Neville M. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2857-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). By in situ hybridization with fluorescently labeled antisense oligonucleotides, we could show that Mex67p is involved in the nuclear export of both the heat shock mRNAs and the ASH1 transcription factor mRNA. Although this does not demonstrate that all yeast mRNAs are exported via the Mex67p-dependent export pathway, it is likely that many (if not all) PolII transcripts follow this route. In contrast to assays reported previously (11.Saavedra C. Tung K.S. Amberg D.C. Hopper A.K. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1608-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the in situassay used here for mRNA detection does not require transformation of strains with high copy number plasmids that overexpress the transcript to be studied. Accordingly, we have shown for the first time that specific endogenous transcripts accumulate in the nucleoplasm in an mRNA export mutant. In the mex67-5 strain, theSSA transcripts accumulated in discrete nucleoplasmic spots, preferentially located close to the nuclear periphery. A similar picture was seen for bulk poly(A)+ RNA in this strain (14.Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. LuÃàhrmann R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). These foci most likely correspond to the several electron-dense aggregates scattered throughout the nucleoplasm that were previously seen in electron micrographs of mex67-5 cells (14.Segref A. Sharma K. Doye V. Hellwig A. Huber J. LuÃàhrmann R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3256-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Whether these are clustered ribonucleoprotein particles is not clear. The observation that the mRNAs do not accumulate at the NPCs suggests that a transport step somewhere between the site of mRNA transcription and the nuclear envelope is inhibited. It is interesting to note that in the case of ASH1, its mRNA accumulates in both mother and daughter nuclei. This is the first evidence that ASH1 is indeed transcribed in both nuclei before being transported to the bud tip. This observation might help to understand better the function of one of the proteins involved in ASH1 mRNA localization, Bni1p (13.Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I. Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P. Science. 1997; 277: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 28.Jansen R.P. Dowzer C. Michaelis C. Galova M. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1996; 84: 687-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Mutations inBNI1 lead to an accumulation of ASH1 mRNA at the bud neck between mother and daughter cell (13.Long R.M. Singer R.H. Meng X. Gonzalez I. Nasmyth K. Jansen R.P. Science. 1997; 277: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). This phenotype has been explained by the synthesis of ASH1 mRNA in the mother cell followed by a block of ASH1 mRNA export from the mother cell at the bud neck (29.Bertrand E. Chartrand P. Schaefer M. Shenoy S.M. Singer R.H. Long R.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar). Alternatively, a misorientation of the localization machinery to the bud neck in bni1mutants could result in the same ASH1 mRNA mislocalization pattern. Our finding that ASH1 mRNA is produced in mother and daughter nuclei is not compatible with the first hypothesis since ASH1 mRNA synthesized in daughter cell nuclei should be properly transported in the case of Bni1p functioning at the bud neck. Therefore, the failure of bni1 mutants to localize ASH1 mRNA is most likely due to an improper orientation of the localization machinery. In summary, we have shown that Mex67p is a mRNA export factor for at least three different mRNA transcripts that differ in abundance, function, and induction. It is therefore likely that Mex67p serves as a general mRNA export factor for PolII-derived transcripts.

Two types of RCs can be distinguished according to the electron acceptors and electron transfer pathways subsequent to the first quinone acceptor.

PCC 6803. ThemenA gene product, naphthoate synthase, and themenB gene product, phytyl transferase, were proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of phylloquinone and were therefore targeted for deletion mutagenesis. Our goal was to disallow the biosynthesis of phylloquinone and produce an empty A1 site, which could then be reconstituted with a variety of quinones. We found that photoautotrophic growth under low light intensities and steady-state rates of flavodoxin reduction were relatively unaffected by the absence of phylloquinone. To account for these results, we proposed that a foreign quinone, Q, had been recruited into the A1 site of PS I the menA and menBmutants. This conclusion was predicated on the finding that plastoquinone-9 could be extracted from PS I complexes isolated from the mutants but not from the wild type. In this paper, we provide spectroscopic evidence for the presence of a functional quinone in the A1 site of the menA and menB mutant strains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. From EPR and ENDOR studies, we derive structural characteristics that are consistent with the identification of Q as plastoquinone-9 (Fig.1). Unlike wild type Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (14.Klughammer C. Pace R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 133-144Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 15.Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Zybailov B.L. Ganago A.O. Vassiliev l.R.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3726-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), wild type Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 does not immediately grow in a culture medium in which H2O is replaced with D2O. Instead, we found it necessary to adapt the cultures to gradually increasing D2O concentrations. The cells were initially grown in BG11 medium containing 35% D2O under normal light intensity (40 to 60 ŒºE m‚àí2 s‚àí1). At late exponential phase (A 730, 0.75‚Äì1.0), the cells were pelleted and reinoculated to A 730 = 0.1 in a BG11 solution containing 40% D2O; the excess cells were frozen in 50/50% (v/v) water/glycerol and retained. This process was repeated by increasing the D2O concentration in 5% increments to 90% D2O, and lastly in a 2% increment to 92% D2O, the maximum that allowed growth. Above 50% D2O, the cells were inoculated twice at a set D2O percentage to ensure the stability of the cultures. Cells above 50% D2O grew at approximately half the rate of H2O grown cells when fully adapted. Cells grown in cultures of 500 ml, and larger volumes were shaken slowly in a 3-liter flat-bottomed Erlenmeyer flask. The flask was slowly purged, but not bubbled, with sterile, dry air to reduce the depletion of D2O by evaporation. Cells grown at 92% D2O could be streaked onto a BG-11 agar plate containing 100% H2O for storage and still retain the ability to grow in D2O liquid cultures. To initiate growth of D2O-adapted cells that have been stored on plates, the cells were inoculated in a medium with 75% D2O, grown to late exponential phase, and then reinoculated in a medium with 92% D2O. The menB mutant cells could grow in BG11 medium only up to 55% D2O (menA cells were not studied). At concentrations higher than 55%, the menBmutant cells maintained a green color, but they did not divide. PS I trimers from the wild type and from the menA and menB mutants were isolated from sucrose gradients (13.Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R. Beauparlant S. Vassiliev I.R.

The PS I complexes were stored in 20% glycerol containing buffer at ‚Äì80 ¬∞C prior to use. Whole-cell EPR experiments were carried out using a Bruker ER300E spectrometer equipped with a TM110 cavity. Mutant and wild type cells ofSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were grown photomixotrophically to early exponential phase, collected by centrifugation at room temperature, and resuspended in growth medium to 400 Œºg ml‚àí1 Chl. The protocol for studying the time-dependent kinetics of P700+ and A1‚àí is a modification of the method described in Refs. 14.Klughammer C. Pace R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 133-144Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar and 16.Klughammer C. Klughammer B. Pace R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3726-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar. Live cells were placed in a 10-ml reservoir that was attached in a closed circuit by tubing and a microprocessor-controlled peristaltic pump (ISCO WIZ) to an aqueous flat cell (Wilmad WG-813-Q). The reservoir, tubing, and TM110 cavity were maintained in complete darkness to ensure that the cells were dark-adapted. A 200-watt mercury-xenon lamp provided controlled illumination by use of a Uni-Blitz shutter and shutter driver/timer (model T132). The EPR computer was programmed to begin data acquisition at t = 0, open the shutter at t = 0.2 s, close the shutter at t = 2.7 s, and pump a fresh sample into the flat cell at t = 4.0 s. This protocol was repeated 20 times at 10-s intervals at a given magnetic field to obtain data with an adequate signal to noise ratio. The magnetic field was stepped 0.5 G, and the process was repeated until data had been obtained at 54 different magnetic field settings. The data were downloaded to a Power Macintosh G3 computer and plotted as three-dimensional and two-dimensional data sets using Transform 2.0 (Spyglass, Inc.). Photoaccumulation experiments at Q-band (34 GHz) were carried out using a Bruker ER300E spectrometer equipped with an ER 5106 QT-W1 resonator with a port for in-cavity illumination. Cryogenic temperatures were maintained with an ER4118CV liquid nitrogen cryostat and controlled with an ER4121 temperature control unit. The microwave frequency was measured with a Hewlett-Packard 5352B frequency counter, and the magnetic field was measured with a Bruker ER035M NMR gaussmeter. The magnetic field was calibrated using Œ≥,Œ≥-bisdiphenylene-Œ≤-phenylallyl complexed 1:1 with benzene. Photoaccumulation protocols on wild type and mutant PS I complexes were carried out in a manner similar to that described in Ref. 15.Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M. Zybailov B.L. Ganago A.O. Vassiliev l.R. Bryant D. Golbeck J.H. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1998; 102: 8288-8299Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar. Prior to the measurement, the pH of the sample was adjusted to 10.0 with glycine buffer, and sodium dithionite was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. After incubation for 20 min in the dark, the sample was placed into the resonator, the temperature adjusted to 205 K, and a background spectrum was recorded. The sample was illuminated with a 20-mW He-Ne laser at 630 nm for 40 min, the laser was turned off, and the light-induced spectrum was recorded. The spectra reported represent the difference between the two measurements. EPR spectral simulations were carried out on a Power Macintosh G3 computer using a Windows 3.1 emulator (SoftWindows 3.0, Insignia Solutions, Santa Clara, CA) and SimFonia software (Bruker Analytik) and imported into IGOR Pro 3.1 (Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). All samples contained 1 mm sodium ascorbate and 50 Œºmphenazine methosulfate as external redox agents and were frozen in the dark for the low temperature experiments. The W-band (94 GHz) transient EPR spectra were measured using a Bruker E680 spectrometer. Illumination was accomplished with a frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser using an optical fiber fed into the sample capillary and ending directly above the PS I sample. Q-band (35 GHz) transient EPR spectra were measured in a set-up as described earlier (see, for example, Ref.17.van der Est A. Hager-Braun C. Leibl W. Hauska G. Stehlik D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), except that a Bruker ER 056 QMV microwave bridge equipped with a home-built cylindrical resonator and an Oxford CF935 liquid helium cryostat was used. The transient and pulsed X-band EPR measurements were performed using the experimental setup described in Ref. 6.Bittl R. Zech S.G. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Lubitz W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12001-12004Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar. Two microwave (mw) pulses with a variable pulse spacing, œÑ, were applied to the radical pair P700+ Q‚àí at a time t, following the laser flash. Electron spin echo (ESE) amplitude modulation curves were obtained by collecting the amplitude of the echo detected at time T ‚âà œÑ after the second mw pulse as a function of œÑ. The mw pulse lengths were set to 8 ns for the first pulse and 16 ns for the second pulse, resulting in flip angles of about 65 and 130¬∞, respectively, with a microwave field B1 = 0.8 mT. The external magnetic field B0 and the detection time T were adjusted to yield maximum out-of-phase echo intensity. The echo modulation was recorded at 512 points with 8-ns increments in œÑ, and 64 traces were averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Pulsed ENDOR studies of the P700+ Q‚àí state were performed using the same experimental setup as the pulsed EPR experiments using a Bruker ESP360D-P ENDOR accessory, a Bruker ER4118X-MD-5W1-EN ENDOR resonator, and an ENI A500 radiofrequency amplifier. The pulse sequence was according to Davies-ENDOR (œÄ(mw) ‚àí œÄ(radiofrequency) ‚àí œÄ/2(mw) ‚àí œÄ(mw) ‚àí echo), with identical lengths of the two microwave œÄ pulses. A detailed description of pulsed ENDOR on a light-induced radical pair state will be provided elsewhere. The semiquinone anion radical of A1 can be observed transiently in whole cells of Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 as a light-induced resonance centered at g = 2.0049 and with a Hpp (peak-to-peak) of 10 G (14.Klughammer C. Pace R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 133-144Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 16.Klughammer C. Klughammer B. Pace R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3726-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The ability to detect a quinone radical in vivo at room temperature thus provides a useful method to determine whether a quinone is present or absent in the A1 binding site of themenA and menB mutants. When whole menAcells of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 are dark-adapted and illuminated for 2.5 s, a plot of time versus magnetic field versus amplitude depicts two independent radicals undergoing time-dependent, nearly reciprocal patterns of oxidation and reduction (Fig. 2). Whole cells of the menB mutant show a similar time course (data not shown). The radical attributed to P700+ is the highly symmetrical resonance with maxima and minima at 3482 and 3490 G, and the radical attributed to a foreign quinone, termed Q‚àí, is the anisotropic resonance visible around 3475 G as the low field shoulder (Fig. 2, arrow). The time course is rationalized by a transient rate limitation in the utilization of NADPH, which causes electrons to back up, reducing, in sequence, FA, FB, FX, and finally the quinone in the A1 site. At a certain point in time, the rate limitation is relieved, the reduced acceptors pass their electrons forward, and P700+ once again is allowed to accumulate due to the availability of oxidized acceptors beyond A0. Were the foreign quinone, Q‚àí, not able to pass electrons forward in the menA and menB mutants, then both the quinone and P700 would remain reduced in the light. The resonances from P700+ and Q‚àí can be better distinguished when the plot is oriented so that the time axis is normal to the plane of the paper. In this depiction, the P700+radical that develops on initial illumination is identified in Fig.3 (top, dotted line) as the highly symmetrical resonance centered at g = 2.0023 with an Hpp of 7.8 G. The spectrum of Q‚àídenoted by the arrow in Fig. 2 is the highly anisotropic resonance in Fig. 3 (top, solid line), with a crossover atg = 2.0042 and an Hpp of 10.5 G. On cessation of illumination, the highly symmetrical resonance in Fig. 3(top, dashed line) is derived again from P700+. The kinetics of P700+ and Q‚àí can be resolved by measuring the former at the Q‚àí zero crossing point of 3484.5 G, and the latter at the P700+ zero crossing point of 3475 G. After an initial instrument-limited rise, P700+undergoes a time-dependent decay that is roughly mirrored as a reciprocal rise in Q‚àí (Fig. 3, bottom). After reaching a maximum at 0.5 s of illumination, the slower decay of Q‚àí is roughly mirrored as a reciprocal rise in P700+. Measurements made at 3486 G, which is on the low field shoulder of the 10.5 G-wide Q‚àí radical and for which the contribution from P700+ is negligible, confirm the kinetic measurement made at 3475 G (zero crossing point of P700+ at g = 2.00232). The relevance of this analysis to the menA andmenB mutants is 2-fold: (i) the g-value andg-anisotropy of the transiently produced Q‚àí is consistent with its identification as a semiquinone anion radical, and (ii) the transiently produced radical shows that Q is capable of not only accepting electrons from A0‚àí via P700+ but also Q‚àí discharging electrons by forward electron transfer after a suitable period of adaptation. Hence, the foreign quinone, Q, is dynamic and participates in forward electron transfer to the iron-sulfur clusters under physiological conditions. The g-anisotropy derived from high field CW EPR studies of photoaccumulated PS I complexes contains information about the degree of aromaticity of the semiquinone anion radical. To extract the g-tensor, we measured the EPR spectrum of the photoaccumulated Q‚àí radical in the wild type and in the menA and menB mutants at 34 GHz (Q-band), a frequency in which the nuclear-electron hyperfine couplings no longer dominate the spectrum. Fig. 4(solid line) shows the spectrum of wild type PS I complexes isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 grown in H2O. At 34 GHz, the field-dependentg-anisotropy dominates the spectrum of A1‚àí (18.Thurnauer M.C. Gast P. Photobiochem. Photobiophys. 1985; 9: 29-38Google Scholar), allowing the turning points ofg xx = 2.0062 and g zz = 2.0021 to be partially resolved. The g yy component of the tensor is obscured by the four hyperfine lines resultng from the high spin density at the carbon position 2 of the phyllosemiquinone radical with the methyl group attached. To better resolve theg-anisotropy, PS I complexes were isolated fromSynechococcus sp. PCC 6803 grown in 92% D2O, the highest concentration that permitted growth. As shown in Fig. 4(solid line), the suppression of the hyperfine couplings results in a narrowing of the line widths of the g-components, with the consequence that g xx, g yy, andg zz are almost completely resolved. Satisfactory simulation of the spectrum is obtained with the g-tensor principal values g xx = 2.0062,g yy = 2.0051, and g zz = 2.0022 and line widths of 2.4, 3.7, and 2.4 G, respectively. This is in good agreement with previous determinations of the A1 g-tensor from 34 GHz (Q-band) studies of deuterated PS I complexes from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (15.Yang F. Shen G. Schluchter W.M.

B. 1998; 102: 8288-8299Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), from 95 GHz (W-band) studies of in nondeuterated PS I complexes from Synechococcus lividus (2.van der Est A. Prisner T. Bittl R. Fromme P. Lubitz W. MoÃàbius K. Stehlik D. J. Phys. Chem. B. 1997; 101: 1437-1443Crossref Google Scholar), and from 283 GHz studies of nondeuterated PS I complexes from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 membrane fragments (9.MacMillan F. Hanley J. van der Weerd L. Knupling M. Un S. Rutherford A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9297-9303Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Because the simulated spectrum (Fig. 4, dashed line) matches the experimental spectrum even in the high field region quite well, the amount of contaminating A0‚àí or P700+ appears to be minimal in the deuterated sample. The nondeuterated spectrum was simulated (Fig. 4, dashed line) using the g-tensor extracted from the deuterated A1‚àí spectrum and a hyperfineA-tensor with principal values of 9.0, 12.9, and 9.0 MHz (19.Rigby S.E.J. Evans M.C.W. Heathcote P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6651-6656Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The major deviations from the simulated spectrum appear principally in the mid- and high field regions and therefore include a minor contribution from A0‚àí and/or P700+. The Q-band EPR spectra of photoaccumulated Q‚àí in PS I complexes isolated from the menB and menA mutants of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 grown in H2O are shown in Fig. 4 (solid lines). In both mutants, the four prominent hyperfine lines are missing, and the g-tensor of Q‚àí appears more anisotropic than that of A1‚àí in the wild type. Attempts to simulate the spectrum of Q‚àí were complicated by a large contamination with a second radical, probably A0‚àí and/or P700+. Using the g-tensor for Q‚àíextracted from transient EPR studies (see below), the spectrum was accurately represented by principal values g xx = 2.0067, g yy = 2.0051, and g zz = 2.0022, with an error of 2 in the last digit, and line widths of 6 G for each value (Fig. 4, dotted line). The difference between the actual and simulated spectrum of Q‚àí yields a roughly symmetrical radical with a g-value of approximately 2.0030 and a line width of approximately 12‚Äì15 G, which identifies the contaminating radical as A0‚àí. Any distortion of the experimental spectrum of Q‚àí would therefore occur in the midfield and high field portions of the spectrum, leaving theg xx resonance of Q‚àí unaffected. Because the g zz component of the tensor is almost invariant for Q‚àí, A0‚àí, and P700+, the deduced g-anisotropy of Q‚àí should not be influenced by contamination of the spectrum with A0‚àí or P700+. Hence, the larger g-anisotropy of Q‚àí, along with the conspicuous absence of prominent hyperfine couplings, agrees with the assessment that a quinone different from phylloquinone has been photoaccumulated the menA and menB mutants. Indeed, the larger g-anisotropy (also seen in the transient spin-polarized EPR spectra; see Figs. 5 and 6, below) can be further rationalized in terms of differences in the delocalization of unpaired electron density over plastoquinone-9 and phylloquinone. Because benzoquinone derivatives, such as plastoquinone-9, have a single aromatic ring, compared with the two rings of naphthoquinone derivatives, such as phylloquinone, the spin density on their carbonyl oxygens is higher, and they exhibit larger g-anisotropies. Thus, with plastoquinone-9 incorporated into the A1 site, an increase in the g-anisotropy compared with native PS I would be expected.Figure 6Spin-polarized transient EPR spectra of PS I from the menB mutant compared with the wild type at three different microwave frequencies (from top tobottom, 95, 35, and 9 GHz). The conditions are the same as for the menA mutant in Fig. 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The spin polarization patterns derived from transient EPR spectra of the functional radical pair state P700+ Q‚àí contain information about the relative orientation of the species involved, as well as about the influence of the protein environment and electron transfer kinetics on the magnetic properties and spin dynamics. For native PS I in frozen solution, spectra of the state P700+A1‚àí are observed from the RC fraction in which cyclic electron transfer to A1 takes place. At temperatures below ‚àº200 K, this fraction accounts for about 13 of the centers, whereas stable charge separation between P700 and FA/FB occurs in the remaining 2/3 (see Ref. 20.Brettel K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholarfor review). In Figs. 5 and6, the spin-polarized transient EPR spectra of PS I complexes from the menA and menBmutants are compared with the wild type at X-, Q-, and W-bands (9, 35, and 94 GHz, respectively). The spectra of the two mutants are depicted as solid curves, and those of the wild type are depicted asdashed curves. In the spectrum of the wild type the low field features are due to A1‚àí, whereas the high field region is dominated by P700+. For the mutants, the high field sides of the spectra are very similar to the corresponding wild type spectra, whereas there is a clear shift of the features on the low field side, particularly at the W-band. The partially resolved hyperfine couplings to the methyl group in position 2 of the phylloquinone (Fig. 1), discussed above with Fig. 4, also result in the feature on the central absorptive maximum o"
https://openalex.org/W2085723358,"When Hsc70 uncoats clathrin-coated vesicles in an auxilin- and ATP-dependent reaction, a single round of rapid uncoating occurs followed by very slow steady-state uncoating. We now show that this biphasic time course occurs because Hsc70 sequentially forms two types of complex with the dissociated clathrin triskelions. The first round of clathrin uncoating is driven by formation of a pre-steady-state assembly protein (AP)-clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complex. Then, following exchange of ADP with ATP, a steady-state AP-clathrin-Hsc70-ATP complex forms that ties up Hsc70, preventing further uncoating. This steady-state complex forms only during uncoating in the presence of APs; in the absence of APs, Hsc70 rapidly dissociates from the uncoated clathrin and continues to carry out uncoating. Whether it is complexed with ATP or ADP, the steady-state complex has very different properties from the pre-steady-state complex in that it cannot be immunoprecipitated by anti-clathrin antibodies and is readily dissociated by fast protein liquid chromatography. Remarkably, when the steady-state complex is incubated with uncoated vesicle membranes in ATP, the pre-steady-state complex reforms, suggesting that the clathrin triskelions in the steady-state complex rebind to the membranes and are again uncoated by Hsc70. We propose that Hsc70 not only uncoats clathrin but also chaperones it to prevent it from inappropriately polymerizing in the cell cytosol and primes it to reform clathrin-coated pits. When Hsc70 uncoats clathrin-coated vesicles in an auxilin- and ATP-dependent reaction, a single round of rapid uncoating occurs followed by very slow steady-state uncoating. We now show that this biphasic time course occurs because Hsc70 sequentially forms two types of complex with the dissociated clathrin triskelions.

Whether it is complexed with ATP or ADP, the steady-state complex has very different properties from the pre-steady-state complex in that it cannot be immunoprecipitated by anti-clathrin antibodies and is readily dissociated by fast protein liquid chromatography. Remarkably, when the steady-state complex is incubated with uncoated vesicle membranes in ATP, the pre-steady-state complex reforms, suggesting that the clathrin triskelions in the steady-state complex rebind to the membranes and are again uncoated by Hsc70. We propose that Hsc70 not only uncoats clathrin but also chaperones it to prevent it from inappropriately polymerizing in the cell cytosol and primes it to reform clathrin-coated pits. assembly protein 70-kDa heat shock protein the constitutive isoform of Hsp70 fast protein liquid chromatography 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid Hsp70 constructed with six-histidine tag at its N terminus dithiothreitol Receptor-mediated endocytosis is an essential cellular process required for the rapid import of membrane-bound receptors into cells (1.Davis C.G.

During receptor-mediated endocytosis, clathrin triskelions polymerize and form clathrin-coated pits on the plasma membrane; similar clathrin-coated pits form on the trans-Golgi membrane (3.Kirchhausen T.

In addition to clathrin and receptors, these coated pits contain assembly proteins that both catalyze the polymerization of clathrin triskelions and bind the receptors that are localized in the coated pit.

In addition to assembly proteins, a number of other proteins, including synaptojanin, amphyphisin, epsin, Eps15, and the small GTPase protein, Rab5-GDI, are involved in the formation and invagination of clathrin-coated pits (13.McPherson P.S.

Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Following invagination of the clathrin-coated pits, the GTP-binding protein dynamin plays a key role in the pinching off of the clathrin-coated pits to form clathrin-coated vesicles (4.Robinson M.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Then, once in the cytosol, the vesicles are uncoated in an ATP-dependent process by Hsc70 and its partner protein, auxilin, which is both a clathrin assembly protein and a DnaJ homolog (24.Ungewickell E. Ungewickell H. Holstein S.E. Lindner R. Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. Nature. 1995; 378: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 25.Jiang R.F. Greener T. Barouch W. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6141-6145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear what triggers clathrin uncoating after the clathrin-coated vesicles pinch off. There is evidence that Hsc70 only uncoats clathrin-coated vesicles and not clathrin-coated pits (26.Heuser J. Steer C.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1457-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), but the mechanism of this selectivity remains a mystery. In addition to carrying out uncoating, it is possible that Hsc70 plays other roles in endocytosis, analogous to the role of Hsc70 in facilitating protein folding and disaggregation, such as keeping clathrin from inappropriately polymerizing in the cytosol and returning clathrin to the membrane to form new clathrin-coated pits. The involvement of Hsc70 in the latter process could explain why ATP appears to be required for formation of clathrin-coated pits and also why free clathrin triskelions added to the cytosol of permeablized cells do not form normal clathrin-coated pits that can pinch off (27.Smythe E. Carter L.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). If the only role of Hsc70 in endocytosis were to carry out uncoating, it would be expected to act catalytically to remove clathrin from clathrin-coated vesicles. However, there is strong evidence that Hsc70 acts stoichiometrically rather than catalytically. Detailed studies showed that the time course of uncoating of clathrin-coated vesiclesin vitro is strikingly nonlinear, consisting of a rapid initial burst of uncoating followed by very slow steady-state uncoating (28.Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, at pH 7, the initial burst of uncoating is nearly stoichiometric with three molecules of Hsc70 uncoating one clathrin triskelion (28.Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Later studies showed that the same time course and stoichiometry of uncoating occurs with clathrin baskets prepared with mixed assembly proteins, purified AP2, AP180, and even with myelin basic protein, which acts as an assembly protein (29.Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B.M. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30551-33056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Therefore, the biphasic time course of uncoating is a general feature of the uncoating reaction (28.Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Prasad K. Barouch W. Martin B.M. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 23758-23761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that uncoating occurs stoichiometrically rather than catalytically not only raises questions about the role of Hsc70 in endocytosis but also raises an important question about the general mechanism of action of Hsc70, since it is still unclear whether Hsc70 works stoichiometrically or catalytically in carrying out other functions in the cell. In the present study, we investigated the biphasic time course of uncoating by Hsc70. We found that during the first round of clathrin-coated vesicle uncoating, an AP-clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complex forms. Surprisingly, however, this pre-steady-state complex does not dissociate when ATP exchanges with ADP but rather is transformed into a steady-state AP-clathrin-Hsc70-ATP complex that prevents further uncoating by Hsc70. This steady-state complex is formed only by uncoating in the presence of APs. In the absence of APs, Hsc70 rapidly dissociates from the uncoated clathrin and carries out further uncoating. In contrast to the pre-steady-state AP-clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complex, whether the steady-state AP-clathrin-Hsc70 complex contains bound ATP or ADP, it cannot be immunoprecipitated and readily dissociates during FPLC, suggesting that it has a unique structure. Strikingly, upon incubation with stripped vesicle membranes in the presence of ATP, the steady-state complex is transformed back into the pre-steady-state complex, suggesting that clathrin from the steady-state complex can rebind to the membranes and be uncoated again. We propose that Hsc70 plays several roles in endocytosis: uncoating clathrin-coated vesicles, keeping clathrin from inappropriately polymerizing in the cytosol, and priming the dissociated clathrin to rebind to membranes to form new clathrin-coated pits. ATP, creatine kinase, creatine phosphate, hexokinase, glucose, imidazole, and ATP agarose were from Sigma. ADP was from Fluka. [14C]formaldehyde and [Œ≥-32P]ATP were from NEN Life Science Products. Nickel-agarose resin was from Invitrogen. The Superose 6 preparative gel and Superose 6 quantitative FPLC column were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The pET15b vector and the BL21(DE3) were from Novagen. The SDS gels (4‚Äì20%) were from Owl Separation Systems. The ECL Western blotting kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The monoclonal antibodies used in this study were AP180‚Äì1 form Sigma, X22 from Affinity Bioreagents, TD.1 and CON.1 from Babco, and the anti-auxilin antibody (monoclonal antibody 100/4) from Ernst Ungewickell. Clathrin-coated vesicles were prepared from fresh calf brains according to the procedure of P. Nandi et al. (32.Nandi P.K. Irace G. Van Jaarsveld P.P. Lippoldt R.E. Edelhoch E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 5881-5885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Isolated clathrin-coated vesicles were stored at 4 ¬∞C at a clathrin concentration of 15 Œºm. Bovine brain Hsc70 was prepared as described previously (28.Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified Hsc70 was stored as pellets in 70% ammonium sulfate solution at 4 ¬∞C and dialyzed in buffer A (20 mm imidazole, 25 mm KCl, 10 mmammonium sulfate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0) overnight at 4 ¬∞C before use. Protein concentrations of clathrin (33.Unanue E.R. Ungewickell E. Branton D. Cell. 1981; 26: 439-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and Hsc70 (28.Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were determined using extinction coefficients (Œµ2801% = 12 for clathrin and 6.2 for Hsc70). Clathrin was purified from bovine brain clathrin-coated vesicles according to the procedure described previously (34.Gao B. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11882-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Briefly, clathrin was extracted from clathrin-coated vesicles using 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.0, and the high speed supernatant containing clathrin and assembly proteins was concentrated and loaded onto a preparative Superose 6 filtration column (2.5 √ó 90 cm) equilibrated in 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.0, at 25 ¬∞C. Fractions of clathrin peak and assembly protein peak were pooled and stored in 0.5 m Tris at 4 ¬∞C. To prepare mixed-AP-clathrin baskets, isolated assembly protein was mixed with purified clathrin at a 1:3 ratio based on absorbance atA 280 and dialyzed in 0.1 m Mes, pH 6.5, overnight. Baskets were collected by centrifugation at 150,000 √ó g for 1 h. The pelleted clathrin baskets were resuspended in buffer A and clarified with a 5-min spin in a microcentrifuge. The concentration of clathrin in prepared baskets was determined after solubilizing the baskets with 0.5 mTris, pH 8.0. In order to make the pure clathrin baskets, clathrin was further purified by repeating the Superose 6 column chromatography step that was used in the original purification procedure. The pure clathrin baskets were polymerized by overnight dialysis of double purified clathrin against buffer B (10 mm Mes, 2 mmcalcium chloride, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5). Polymerized clathrin baskets were sedimented by centrifugation for 1 h at 150,000 √ó g at 4 ¬∞C and suspended in buffer A. The suspension was centrifuged again for 1 h at 150,000 √ó g at 4 ¬∞C. The baskets were resuspended in buffer A and clarified with a 2-min spin in a microcentrifuge. Both the mixed-AP-clathrin baskets and the pure clathrin baskets were stable for at least 2 days. Purified clathrin was trace-labeled according to the procedure of Jentoft and Dearborn (35.Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Generally, 10 ml of clathrin (‚àº2 Œºm) in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, was incubated with 5 mmsodium cyanoborohydride and 10 ŒºCi of [14C]formaldehyde for 2 h at 25 ¬∞C before 5 mm DTT was added, and the mixture was dialyzed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm DTT, and subsequently 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm DTT to remove free label. Recombinant His6-Hsp70 was overproduced in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, grown at 25 ¬∞C, containing a pET15b vector with the human Hsp70 gene. The His6-Hsp70 fusion protein was purified using an ATP-agarose column. The human Hsp70 was subcloned from pET11 into the pET15 vector. The uncoating reaction typically was carried out using Hsc70 and clathrin baskets in the presence of ATP in buffer A at 25 ¬∞C. The concentrations of Hsc70, clathrin baskets, and ATP are specified for each experiment in the figure legends.14C radioactively labeled clathrin baskets were routinely used in the experiments testing the activity of Hsc70 in the uncoating supernatant. The clathrin released by Hsc70 from the clathrin baskets was determined by quantification of the clathrin in the supernatant after centrifugation either by densitometric scanning of SDS gels or by scintillation counting when 14C-labeled clathrin was used. Clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complexes were measured as described previously (34.Gao B. Eisenberg E. Greene L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11882-11888Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 36.Gao B.C. Biosca J. Craig E.A. Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19565-19571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, following centrifugation of the uncoating mixture, the free Hsc70 was separated from Hsc70 bound to clathrin by gel filtration FPLC on a Superose 6 column equilibrated in buffer A containing 1 mm ADP and 1 mmPi. Fractions containing clathrin and clathrin-Hsc70 complexes were analyzed on SDS gels. The amount of Hsc70 associated with clathrin was quantified by densitometric scanning. The Hsc70 was incubated for 8 min with [Œ≥-32P]ATP to replace all of the bound nucleotide on the Hsc70 with [Œ≥-32P]ATP (37.Gao B. Emoto Y. Greene L. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8507-8513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before the addition to the final reaction mixture. ATPase activity was determined from the amount of Pi released from [Œ≥-32P]ATP (38.Chock S.P. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3229-3235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation count using a Beckman LS 3801 counter. Standard His6-Hsp70 exchange assays consisted of the supernatant of the uncoating reaction that was carried out by His6-Hsp70. The solution was incubated for 30 min at 25 ¬∞C with or without Hsc70. The nickel-agarose resin was then added to the solution. After incubating for 10 min on a rotator, the resin was spun down in a microcentrifuge, and the uncoating activity of the Hsc70 remaining in the supernatant was tested by adding baskets assembled with [14C]clathrin. The initial uncoating reaction was carried out in the presence of 0.1 mm ATP, Hsc70, and mixed AP-clathrin baskets at the concentrations specified for each experiment in the figure legend. When the uncoating reached steady state, 50 unit/ml hexokinase and 3 mm glucose were added to the reaction solution at 25 ¬∞C and incubated for 1 h. This was followed by the addition of 60 units/ml creatine kinase and 15 mm phosphocreatine, and, after incubating for 10 min at 25 ¬∞C, the uncoating activity of Hsc70 was tested. The conversion of nucleotide from ADP to ATP was confirmed by high pressure liquid chromatography analysis. A mixture of clathrin antibodies consisting of X22, CON.1, and TD.1 was added to the supernatant and then rotated for 2 h at room temperature. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were then added, and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h on a rotator. The beads were washed twice prior to boiling in SDS gel loading buffer. Samples were analyzed for clathrin and Hsc70 by SDS gel electrophoresis. We showed previously that, during the initial burst of uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles by Hsc70, a clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complex forms with three molecules of Hsc70 bound per clathrin triskelion (28.Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the complex can then be isolated by FPLC chromatography on Superose 6 (39.Prasad K. Heuser J. Eisenberg E. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6931-6939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On this basis, we explained the slow steady-state uncoating by proposing that very slow release of ADP from the clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complex limits the rate at which the complex dissociates in ATP and thus limits the rate of further uncoating by Hsc70 (28.Greene L.E. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6682-6687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we later observed that ADP dissociates quite rapidly from the clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complex in ATP with a half-life of less than 5 min at 25 ¬∞C. In these experiments, the rate of ADP dissociation was measured by making use of the fact that Hsc70 only dissociates from the clathrin-Hsc70 complex during Superose 6 chromatography if ADP bound to the complex has exchanged with ATP (39.Prasad K. Heuser J. Eisenberg E. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6931-6939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, slow steady-state uncoating cannot be explained by the slow release of ADP from the clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complex. Another possible explanation for the slow steady-state uncoating is that partially uncoated clathrin baskets become resistant to further uncoating by Hsc70, but we ruled out this possibility by showing that adding fresh Hsc70 during steady-state uncoating caused a second round of uncoating of the residual baskets (Fig.1 A, open triangles), while adding fresh clathrin baskets during steady-state uncoating did not cause a second round of uncoating (Fig.1 A, open circles). Furthermore, when we isolated the supernatant of the uncoating reaction, we found that, even after it was incubated with ATP for 1 h at 25 ¬∞C, it still could not carry out a second round of uncoating when mixed with fresh mixed AP-clathrin baskets (Fig. 1 B, open triangles). It is therefore clear that, after carrying out the initial burst of uncoating, Hsc70 is unable to carry out further uncoating. The simplest explanation for this phenomenon is product inhibition;i.e. clathrin released during the initial burst of uncoating rebinds to Hsc70 and prevents further uncoating. However, we found that neither free clathrin nor a mixture of free clathrin and APs had any effect on the uncoating activity of Hsc70 (Fig. 1 B,filled squares). Therefore, only newly uncoated clathrin and APs are able to inhibit the uncoating activity of the Hsc70. Furthermore, this effect is stoichiometric with each clathrin triskelion inhibiting the uncoating of the three molecules of Hsc70 involved in its uncoating but, as we noted above, not the uncoating activity of freshly added Hsc70. It therefore seemed possible that when ATP exchanges with ADP on the pre-steady-state clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complex formed during the initial burst of uncoating, the clathrin is transformed into a steady-state clathrin-Hsc70-ATP complex that is maintained over many cycles of ATP hydrolysis and thus prevents further uncoating by Hsc70. Clearly, such a steady-state clathrin-Hsc70-ATP complex cannot be isolated by FPLC chromatography on Superose 6, since we (39.Prasad K. Heuser J. Eisenberg E. Greene L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6931-6939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have already shown that, following exchange of ATP with ADP, the clathrin and Hsc70 dissociate on Superose 6. Therefore, to minimize dissociation of the possible steady-state complex, we attempted to isolate it using FPLC on Superose 12 in ADP and also carried out the uncoating reaction at higher concentrations of Hsc70 and clathrin-coated vesicles. Fig.2 A shows the chromatography profile from the Superose 12 column of clathrin and Hsc70 from the supernatant of the uncoating reaction. The clathrin (circles) eluted in a single peak in the void volume of the column, while the Hsc70 (triangles) eluted over three regions, one clearly associated with the clathrin, a second trailing the clathrin peak, and a third consisting of free Hsc70. The ratio of Hsc70 to clathrin in the clathrin peak, obtained from measuring the intensity of Hsc70 and clathrin on SDS gels, showed that the clathrin fractions were about 60% saturated with Hsc70. Furthermore, since a considerable fraction of the Hsc70 trailed behind the clathrin peak in the elution pattern, even more Hsc70 was complexed with the clathrin when the supernatant was initially applied to the column. Therefore, following exchange of ATP with ADP, the pre-steady-state complex released during the initial burst of uncoating appears to be transformed to a steady-state complex that can be isolated from the supernatant of the uncoating reaction. Evidence that this steady-state complex prevents uncoating by tying up the Hsc70 comes from our observation that, compared with the control (Fig. 2 C, bar 1), the uncoating activity of the complex was still inhibited after ATP was restored to the complex eluted in ADP from the Superose 12 column (bar 4). The eluted complex did have a somewhat higher uncoating activity than the supernatant obtained from the uncoating reaction at an Hsc70 concentration comparable with that in the void volume (bar 2), but this is probably due to the 10-fold dilution that occurred during the column chromatography, since the same small increase in activity occurred when the complex that was applied to the Superose column was diluted 10-fold (bar 3). Since the complex isolated from the Superose 12 column had bound ADP, our data suggest that, even after the ATP on the steady-state complex is hydrolyzed to ADP, the complex remains intact and is still unable to carry out uncoating when ATP is restored. To directly test whether the steady-state complex remains intact after ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, we treated the supernatant of the uncoating reaction with hexokinase/glucose and then restored ATP using excess creatine kinase/creatine phosphate. We confirmed that the Hsc70 in the supernatant was still unable to carry out uncoating after this treatment (Fig. 1 B, open squares). The fact that the steady-state complex remained intact after ATP was hydrolyzed to ADP is consistent with our observation that the Hsc70 in the supernatant of the uncoating reaction was unable to carry out uncoating for more than 1 h after the supernatant was isolated, although many cycles of ATP hydrolysis occurred during this period of time. Therefore, our data suggest that very slow steady-state uncoating occurs because the pre-steady-state clathrin-Hsc70-ADP complex formed during the initial burst of uncoating is transformed to a steady-state clathrin-Hsc70-ATP complex that remains intact through many cycles of ATP hydrolysis and therefore ties up the Hsc70, preventing further uncoating. The fractions eluted from the Superose 12 column that contained the steady-state complex contained not only clathrin and Hsc70 but also APs. Both of the neuronal specific APs, AP180 and auxilin, completely dissociated along with clathrin during the uncoating reaction unlike AP2, which, in agreement with a recent report (40.Hannan L.A. Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2217-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), showed only limited dissociation (data not shown). Fig. 2 B shows the elution profile from Superose 12 of auxilin (circles) and AP180 (triangles) compared with that of clathrin (dashed line). Most of the auxilin coeluted with the clathrin, and while the AP180 showed more dissociation from the clathrin during the column chromatography, there was still significant overlap with the clathrin peak. Since mixed AP-clathrin baskets contained about one auxilin and one AP180 per clathrin triskelion, 2R. Jiang, B. Gao, K. Prasad, L. E. Greene, and E. Eisenberg, unpublished data. at least one AP per clathrin was present in the steady-state complex eluted from the Superose 12 column. Since these data suggest that APs may be bound to the steady-state complex, we directly investigated the role of APs in preventing Hsc70 from carrying out multiple rounds of uncoating following the initial burst of uncoating. In these experiments, we used pure clathrin baskets prepared with clathrin that had been twice purified by Superose 6 chromatography to ensure that it was AP-free. Strikingly, the time course of uncoating of these pure clathrin baskets was not biphasic. Rather, a linear time course occurred until the clathri"

Here, we show that CD95-induced ceramide elevation occurs during the initiation phase of apoptosis. We titrated down the amount of FADD transfected into HeLa and 293T cells until it was insufficient for apoptosis, although cycloheximide (CHX) still triggered the effector phase. Even in the absence of CHX, ceramide levels increased rapidly, peaking at 2.7 ¬± 0.2-fold of control 8 h post-transfection. Dominant negative FADD failed to confer ceramide generation or CHX-mediated apoptosis. Ceramide generation induced by FADD was initiator caspase-dependent, being blocked by crmA. Limited pro-caspase 8 overexpression also increased ceramide levels 2.7 ¬± 0.2-fold, yet failed, without CHX, to initiate apoptosis. Expression of membrane-targeted oligomerized CD-8 caspase 8 induced apoptosis without CHX, yet elevated ceramide only to a level equivalent to limited pro-caspase 8 transfection. Ceramide elevations were detected concurrently by diacylglycerol kinase and electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.

Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Ceramide is the second messenger in this system and can be generated either by hydrolysis of SM through SM-specific phospholipases C termed sphingomyelinases (SMases) or by de novo synthesis through the enzyme ceramide synthase. There are at least two classes of SMase, acidic and neutral (ASMase and NSMase), respectively, distinguished by their pH optima. SMase or ceramide synthase activation by stress is cell- and stress type-dependent (4.Bose R. Verheij M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Scotto K. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Either alone, or in combination with other signals, ceramide, once generated, propagates the cellular stress response by coupling to effector systems. Different cells react differently to elevations in ceramide: some cells launch the apoptotic program, others commit to terminal differentiation, or undergo cell cycle arrest, depending on the effector pathways activated. Nonetheless, the most often reported outcome of ceramide signaling is induction of apoptosis (2.Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar, 3.Mathias S.

Selectivity was established by the lack of activity of other lipid second messengers or phospholipases as inducers of apoptosis and the failure of the naturally occurring dihydroceramide to signal death. For agents that use the de novo pathway for ceramide generation, the fungal toxin fumonisin B1, an inhibitor of ceramide synthase, uniformly blocks apoptosis induction (4.Bose R. Verheij M.

Furthermore, genetic inactivation of ceramide generation through ASMase provides protection against radiation- and endotoxin-induced apoptosisin vitro and in vivo (17.Santana P. PenÃÉa L.A.

Thus, for many stresses ceramide generation appears to signal apoptosis independent of initiating caspases. (It should, however, be noted that ceramide signaling of apoptosis is cell type-specific as data from ASMase knockout mice treated with total body irradiation indicate that endothelium but not thymocytes utilize this mechanism (17.Santana P. PenÃÉa L.A. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Martin S. Green D. McLoughlin M. Cordon-Cardo C. Schuchman E.H. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1996; 86: 189-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar).) Whether ceramide generation precedes induction of apoptosis upon activation of cytokine receptors or is subsequent to the commitment process is less certain. Some investigators have reported rapid ceramide generation after activation of the 55-kDa TNF receptor or Fas/APO-1/CD95, yet others have been unable to detect early ceramide generation and hence order ceramide downstream in the apoptotic cascade (21.Karasavvas N. Zakeri Z. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22.Watts J.D. Gu M. Patterson S.D. Aebersold R. Polverino A.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present investigations was to develop models in which ceramide generation could be molecularly ordered definitively with respect to CD95 signaling. Triggering CD95 induces formation of a death-inducing signaling complex, comprised of the adaptor molecules FADD/MORT-1 and caspase 8, resulting in release of active caspase 8 to initiate the apoptotic process (23.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar, 24.Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J.

Apoptosis, however, ensues only after subsequent steps which commit the cells to effector caspase activation. Recently, Peter and co-workers (25.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.K. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar) reported that CD95-induced death may occur in different cells by two separate mechanisms. Type I cells respond to receptor activation with robust initiator caspase activation and apparently signal apoptosis exclusively via a hierarchical caspase cascade. This form of CD95-induced death is resistant to Bcl-2 inhibition and independent of mitochondrial permeability transition and release of mitochondrial apoptogenic factors (i.e.cytochrome c or apoptosis-inducing factor) (26.Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In contrast, Type II cells have reduced death-inducing signaling complex formation, and effector caspase activation occurs downstream of mitochondrial dysfunction. This latter mechanism was shown to be inhibitable by Bcl-2 and stimulable by ceramide analogs. Consistent with these observations, all published reports show that in cytokine-treated cells, ceramide-mediated apoptosis is Bcl-2-inhibitable (2.Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar, 3.Mathias S. PenÃÉa L. Kolesnick R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 465-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 27.Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Exp.

Med. 1997; 186: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The sensitivity of the Type II cells to ceramide analogs suggests that if ceramide is to play a role in induction of apoptosis it would likely occur under conditions where initiator caspase activation was limiting. In the present studies, we titrated down the amount of transfected FADD or pro-caspase 8 in HeLa and 293T cells to the point where they no longer induced apoptosis. Under these conditions, FADD and pro-caspase 8 still induced maximal ceramide generation, which were inhibitable by CrmA. These investigations provide evidence that ceramide generation is initiator caspase-dependent and occurs prior to commitment to the effector phase of the apoptotic process, definitively ordering ceramide as proximal in CD95 signaling. Anti-FADD, anti-caspase 8 and anti-Fas (clone CH11) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-cytochrome cantibody (65981A) was from PharMingen. Horseradish-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ceramide type III, Hoechst-33258 and CHX were from Sigma. Escherichia coli diacylglycerol (DAG) kinase was from Biomol. HeLa and 293T cells were grown in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 ¬∞C in 5% CO2. For transfection, 2 √ó 105 cells were seeded per 55-mm2 tissue culture dish. After 24 h, LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) transfection was performed as per the manufacturer's instructions using 0.5 Œºg of total DNA/5 √ó 105 cells and 5 Œºl of LipofectAMINE reagent in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM; Life Technologies, Inc.). After 12 h, transfected cells were returned to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's growth medium.

Cells were harvested, washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (25 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5), 137 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Œºg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaVO4). After 20 min, lysates were centrifuged at 8000 √ó g for 10 min and supernatant protein content determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). 50 Œºg of protein were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (Tris-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween 20). Blots were incubated with anti-caspase 8 or anti-FADD rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:1000 dilution in TBST), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody. Proteins were visualized by ECL. Nuclear apoptosis was assessed by staining of paraformaldehyde fixed cells with the DNA-binding fluorochrome Hoechst-33258 as described previously (29.Oberhammer F.A. Pavelka M. Sharma S. Tiefenbacher R. Purchio A.F. Bursch W. Schulte-Hermann R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5408-5412Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). A minimum of 400 cells were scored at each point. Cell fractionation was performed as described previously (30.Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar, 31.Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4289) Google Scholar). Immunoblots for cytosolic and mitochondrial cytochrome c were performed as described above. Ceramide was measured by DAG kinase as described previously (32.Bose R. Chen P. Loconti A. Grullich C. Abrams J. Kolesnick R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28852-28859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For ceramide analysis by mass spectrometry (MS), cell pellets were transferred to 13 √ó 100-mm glass test tubes, and 0.5 ml of 0.1 m KOH in CHCl3-CH3OH (1:2, v/v) was added with 5 nmol of C12-ceramide as an internal standard. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 ¬∞C, then diluted with 3.5 ml of CH3OH-H2O (1:1) and spun in a clinical centrifuge to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml RP18 column (pre-equilibrated with 1:1 CH3OH-H2O after washing the resin in 100% CH3OH, 100% C6H14, 100% CH3OH, and 1:1 CH3OH-H2O). The column was washed with 2 ml of CH3OH-H2O (1:1) then eluted with (a) 2 ml of CH3OH-H2O (9:1) and 2 ml of 100% CH3OH, (b) 5 ml of CH3OH-C6H14 (2:1), and (c) 4 ml of CH3OH-C6H14-HOAc (66:33:1). Eluates were dried under vacuum (all fractions were monitored by MS and ceramide was found in fraction ‚Äúb‚Äù). Cell extracts (from 0.5‚Äì1 √ó 107 cells) were reconstituted in 1 ml of 50:50 CH3OH/CHCl3. A 100 Œºl aliquot was diluted to 1 ml with 890 Œºl of 5 mmNH4C2O2H3 in CH3OH and 10 Œºl of glacial HOAc. 20 Œºl of this solution was injected via a Rheodyne 8125 injector into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 50 Œºl min‚àí1. Experiments were performed on a PE-Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a turbo ion spray source. Dry N2 was used as the nebulizing gas at a flow rate of 6 liter min‚àí1. The ion spray needle was held at 5500 V, while the orifice and ring voltages were kept low (15 and 180 V, respectively) as was the orifice temperature (50 ¬∞C) to prevent collisional decomposition of molecular ions prior to entry into the first quadrupole. Precursor ion spectra were acquired by scanning Q1 from 500u-700u in 0.1 u steps with a dwell time of 1.0 ms. N2was used to collisionally induce dissociations in Q2, which was offset from Q1 by 40 V. Q3 was then set to pass molecularly distinctive product ions (N‚Äú ions) of m/z 264.2. Multiple reaction monitoring scans were acquired by setting Q1 and Q3 to pass the precursor and product ions of the five most abundant ceramides found in the precursor ion scans. These transitions occurred at m/z538.7/264.3, 566.5/264.3, 622.7/264.3, 648.7/264.3, 650.7/264.3, corresponding to ceramides with a d-18:1 sphingoid base and C16:0, C18:0, C22:0, C24:1, and C24:0 fatty acid, respectively. Dwell time was 40 ms for each transition. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's ttest and t test for correlation coefficient. Linear regression analysis was by the method of least squares. Initial studies examined the effect of overexpression of the gene coding for FADD on ceramide levels in HeLa cells. Prior studies (23.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) reported that transfection with 5‚Äì10 Œºg pCDNA3 AU1-FADD/106 cells signaled apoptosis. For our studies, we reduced the quantity of the plasmid 5‚Äì10-fold (1 Œºg of pCDNA3 AU1-FADD/106 cells) to attenuate the induction of apoptosis (see below). HeLa cells normally manifest low levels of FADD. Transfection with small amounts of pCDNA3 AU1-FADD significantly increased FADD expression within 2 h of resuspension into growth medium, and a 10-fold increase in FADD levels above control was measured by 12 h (not shown). Concomitantly, ceramide levels rose peaking at 8 h (Fig. 1 A;p < 0.05 versus pCDNA at all times after 2 h (n = 3)). Ceramide elevation was maintained for at least 24 h post-transfection. In contrast, transfection of a truncated variant of FADD lacking the N-terminal DED domain, which serves dominant negative function (DN-FADD) (35.Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), did not lead to ceramide generation (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 C shows that FADD-mediated ceramide generation after limited FADD transfection was not associated with expression of apoptosis. Limited expression of FADD failed to induce apoptosis at any time up until 12 h after resuspending cells into growth medium as measured by bisbenzimide staining (Fig. 1 C) or by cytochromec release (Fig. 1 C, inset). Other experiments showed that apoptosis was not detected for as long as 48 h under these conditions (not shown). In contrast, when cells were transfected with higher amounts of the FADD vector (4 Œºg of pCDNA3 AU1-FADD/106 cells), we, like other investigators (23.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar, 33.Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4345-4349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), observed as much as 50‚Äì60% apoptosis by 48 h (n = 3). As ceramide levels peaked in our system at 8 h after limited FADD transfection, we arbitrarily chose to add CHX (10 Œºg/ml) at 12 h to allow for induction of apoptosis. Fig. 1 C shows that addition of CHX to these FADD overexpressing cells, but not to cells transfected with DN-FADD or the pCDNA vector alone (not shown), rapidly induced apoptosis as determined by bisbenzimide staining (Fig. 1 C) and confirmed by cytochrome c release into cytosol (Fig. 1 C,inset). A reciprocal reduction in mitochondrial cytochromec content was detected (not shown). CHX addition had no effect on ceramide levels in pCDNA- or DN-FADD-transfected cells and induced no further elevation of ceramide levels in FADD-transfected cells. HeLa cells were also resistant to C2-ceramide (50 Œºm)-induced apoptosis measured by bisbenzimide staining or the use of the fluorogenic caspase substrate Z-DEVD-AFC, as described previously (36.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3804) Google Scholar). In contrast, 46 ¬± 6% of CHX pretreated HeLa cells underwent apoptosis within 6 h of C2-ceramide addition (n = 3), resulting in a 8.3-fold increase in DEVDase activity. These studies show that active FADD induces ceramide generation independent of the effector phase of apoptosis. We used the same strategy to explore the association of ceramide generation after FADD transfection to induction of apoptosis in 293T cells. At 24 h post-transfection with limited amounts of pCDNA3 AU1-FADD (1 Œºg of pCDNA3 AU1-FADD/106cells), 293T cells transfected with pCDNA3 AU1-FADD, but not pCDNA, displayed a 2.5 ¬± 0.2-fold increase in ceramide levels (Fig. 1 D; p < 0.02 versuspCDNA). Nonetheless, the morphologic appearance of the 293T monolayer (fibroblastoid with dendritic-like processes) was unaltered. Furthermore, there was no evidence of apoptosis as measured by bisbenzimide staining (Fig. 1 E) or cytochrome crelease into the cytosol (Fig. 1 E, inset). Hence, like HeLa cells, 293T cells expressing small amounts of FADD failed to undergo apoptosis. In contrast to HeLa cells, however, CHX (10 Œºg/ml) addition to 293T cells expressing limited FADD was insufficient to induce apoptosis, unless cells were concomitantly treated with the pro-apoptotic anti-Fas antibody clone CH11 (100 ng/ml; Fig.1 E). Furthermore, minimal apoptosis occurred in response to anti-Fas antibody CH11 in 293T cells lacking FADD overexpression. FADD-expressing cells, when treated with anti-Fas antibody CH11 and CHX, rounded up by 6 h and began to lift off the dish. At 24 h after treatment, nearly 75% of cells were apoptotic as measured by bisbenzimide staining (Fig. 1 E) and confirmed by cytochromec release into the cytosol (Fig. 1 E,inset). However, treatment of FADD-expressing cells with antibody CH11 and CHX induced no further increase in ceramide accumulation, which remained at 2.7 ¬± 0.3-fold of control. These studies show that overexpression of FADD induces ceramide elevation independent of the effector phase of apoptosis in both 293T and HeLa cells. Since use of the DAG kinase assay to quantify ceramide has been questioned recently (37.Watts J. Gu M. Polverino A. Patterson S. Aebersold R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7292-7296Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), increases in ceramide were confirmed by tandem MS. For these analyses, the ceramides of 293T cells were first determined to be sphingosine-containing species comprised mainly of palmitic acid (C16:0) and lesser amounts of C18:0, C22:0, C24:0, and C24:1 fatty acids, as shown in Fig.2 A. With this information, both the amounts and types of cellular ceramides were measured (Fig.2 B) for vector only (A)-, FADD (B)-, and caspase 8 (C)-transfected 293T cells using multiple reaction monitoring as described under ‚ÄúMaterials and Methods.‚Äù In the study depicted, overexpression of FADD and pro-caspase 8 (see below), injected as duplicate aliquots of each sample, resulted in elevation of ceramide levels to 2.00 ¬± 0.01-fold and 2.99 ¬± 0.03-fold of control, respectively. There was excellent agreement between the two methods (i.e. the mean of the differences between the results by DAG kinase assay and MS was only 15 ¬± 9%,n = 6), thus, confirming that expression of these gene products increases ceramide amounts in the cells. Differences in ceramide species were not found in FADD- and pro-caspase 8-overexpressors when compared with controls. To determine whether ceramide generation induced by FADD is caspase-dependent, we co-transfected 293T cells with the initiator-caspase inhibitor crmA, and FADD. Co-transfection of crmA did not affect expression of FADD (Fig.3 A, bottom panel). However, crmA completely blocked FADD-induced ceramide generation (Fig.3 A). These investigations provide evidence that FADD-induced ceramide generation is initiator caspase-dependent. To address this issue directly, we overexpressed a small amount of pro-caspase 8a in 293T cells (1 Œºg of pCDNA- FLICE/106 cells). Under the conditions of our study, pro-caspase 8 was expressed to a level 2‚Äì3-fold of control, which resulted in the generation of the 43- and 41-kDa processed forms described in the literature (Fig. 3 B, right panel) (38.Ferrari D. Stepczynska A. Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 39.Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). (Note: lower molecular weight forms were not detected under these conditions.) Overexpression of pro-caspase 8 resulted in a 2.7 ¬± 0.2-fold increase in ceramide levels as measured using the DAG kinase assay (Fig. 3 B, left panel; p < 0.05 versus pCDNA), which was confirmed by tandem MS (Fig. 2). As with limited FADD overexpression, which induced similar ceramide elevation in 293T cells, limited pro-caspase 8 overexpression failed to elicit apoptosis (Fig.3 C). Again, addition of CHX (10 Œºg/ml) with anti-Fas antibody CH11 (50 ng/ml), but not CHX alone, resulted in rapid apoptosis of 293T cells specifically expressing limited pro-caspase 8. Limited pro-caspase 8 overexpression also induced a 2.4 ¬± 0.2-fold increase in ceramide content in HeLa cells and conferred CHX-dependent apoptosis (not shown). These studies provide direct evidence that ceramide generation is initiator caspase-dependent and independent of the effector phase of apoptosis. To compare levels of ceramide generated independent of apoptosis with those associated with apoptosis, we expressed CD8-caspase 8 in HeLa cells. Prior studies showed that expression of this membrane-targeted oligomerized form of caspase 8 efficiently induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. In contrast to pro-caspase 8, CD8-caspase 8 expression in HeLa cells induced apoptosis independent of CHX (Fig. 3 D,right panel; p < 0.05 versusCD8). Nevertheless, CD8-caspase 8 induced only a 2.7 ¬± 0.3-fold elevation in ceramide in HeLa cells (Fig. 3 D, left panel; p < 0.05 versus CD8), a level similar to that induced by pro-caspase 8 expression in the absence of CHX (see above). These studies indicate that generation of ceramide in this system is initiator caspase-mediated and occurs independent of whether apoptosis progresses to the effector stage. While in several stress response models ceramide generation clearly precedes apoptosis and is not inhibitable by caspase blockade, it has been questioned whether ceramide elevation during CD95 signaling occurs prior to or after the commitment step to apoptosis (21.Karasavvas N. Zakeri Z. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 115-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 22.Watts J.D. Gu M. Patterson S.D. Aebersold R. Polverino A.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 40.Hofmann K. Dixit V.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 374-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The present studies resolve this issue. We show that HeLa and 293T cells overexpressing amounts of FADD or pro-caspase 8 insufficient for an apoptotic response require CHX treatment to activate the effector phase of apoptosis. Nevertheless, ceramide elevation occurs in these cells independent of CHX, indicating that ceramide is an early stage product of CD95 signaling and independent of the effector stage of apoptosis entirely. Our data confirm previous reports (41.Tewari M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3255-3260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar, 42.Schwandner R. Wiegmann K. Bernardo K. Kreder D. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5916-5922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) that ceramide generation depends on initiator caspase action, as evidenced by ceramide elevations in response to caspase 8 expression and its inhibition by crmA. Even if a minute amount of apoptosis did occur, undetectable by our assays, these studies nonetheless show that the ceramide response is exquisitely sensitive to initiator caspase action. Consistent with this observation, pro-caspase 8, which in the absence of CHX delivered no measurable apoptosis, and CD8-caspase 8, which induced marked apoptosis independent of CHX, induced equivalent ceramide elevations. Whether unprocessed pro-caspase 8 is the active form in our studies, as has been suggested for pro-caspase 9 (43.Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), or whether the small amount of processed enzyme induces the ceramide elevation is unknown. Although these studies do not address the role of ceramide in CD95-induced apoptosis, they molecularly order ceramide proximal in CD95 signaling. Nevertheless, the requirement for CHX for low levels of FADD, caspase 8, and exogenous ceramide to signal apoptosis in these cells is consistent with endogenous ceramide serving as an amplification signal for CD95-induced death. Furthermore, these investigations do not indicate whether acid or neutral SMase mediates CD95-induced ceramide elevation, as both mechanisms have been reported downstream of initiator caspase activation (44.Boesen-de Cock J.G.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5267-5270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Ceramide elevation as detected by the DAG kinase assay was validated in the present study by the use of tandem mass spectrometry. Gill and Windebank (47.Gill J.S. Windebank A.J. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 876-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have also measured ceramide generation by both DAG kinase and MS within 12 h of treatment of primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion neurons with the antineoplastic agent suramin. Apoptosis in their study was not manifest until 36 h, hence ceramide generation preceded apoptosis by many hours. This and the present study reconfirm the utility of measuring ceramide elevation by DAG kinase. The present investigations bring up the question of why some investigators have found it difficult to show ceramide elevations preceding apoptosis. Although it is possible that the use of this mechanism is confined to specific cells, recent studies provide another explanation. Merrill and co-workers (48.Nikolova-Karakashian M. Morgan E.T. Alexander C. Liotta D.C. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18718-18724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) showed that interleukin 1Œ≤ induced a 40% reduction in SM mass within 15 min of stimulation of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes but no ceramide elevation. Since SMase is the only known enzyme capable of catalyzing SM degradation in mammalian cells, these investigators tracked ceramide metabolites. They showed that concomitant with SMase action, interleukin 1Œ≤ also rapidly activated ceramidase, which degraded the generated ceramide to free sphingoid bases. Thus to rule out a contribution of the SM pathway, ceramide determination must be accompanied by measurement of SM content. Consistent with this observation, Henk van den Bosch and co-workers showed that nitric oxide (NO) induced sustained ceramide elevation and apoptosis in rat renal mesangial cells whereas TNFŒ± induced only a transient early ceramide elevation without apoptosis (49.Huwiler A. Pfeilschifter J. van den Bosch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7190-7195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Nevertheless both agents induced prolonged SMase activation. Further examination of the pattern of enzyme activation revealed that TNFŒ±, but not NO, simultaneously increased ceramidase activity, attenuating the ceramide rise. Most importantly, pharmacologic inactivation of ceramidase usingN-oleoly-ethanolamine, converted the ceramide elevation in response to TNFŒ± to the sustained pattern and conferred apoptosis. Similarly, the rapid conversion of ceramide to glucosylceramide via the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase appears to attenuate apoptosis in response to diverse chemotherapeutic agents in cells displaying the multidrug resistance phenotype and pharmacologic or genetic inactivation of glucosylceramide synthase results in sustained ceramide elevation and sensitization to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis (50.Lavie Y.

Anticancer Res. 1998; 18: 475-480PubMed Google Scholar). These studies show that ceramide, once generated, is subject to regulated metabolism, which results in decreases in ceramide mass via a variety of different enzymatic mechanisms. Based on this information, we suggest that many of the studies that concluded that the SM pathway is not involved in the early action of cytokines and other stresses, based solely on the inability to detect ceramide elevation, should be reevaluated. While the present studies demonstrate that CD95 signals ceramide generation during the initiation phase of apoptosis, they do not address a role, if any, for ceramide in CD95-induced apoptosis. Recentin vivo studies, however, define a requirement for ceramide in one form of CD95-induced death. 2Lin, T., Genestier, L., Pinkaski, M. J., Castro, A., Nicholas, S., Mogil, R., Paris, F., Fuks, Z., Schuchman, E. H., Kolesnick, R. N., and Green, D. R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 8657‚Äì8663. Whereas intravenous injection of the Jo2 anti-Fas antibody (3 Œºg/25 g mouse body weight) into acid SMase knockout mice failed to effect hepatocyte apoptosis or death, massive hepatocyte apoptosis and animal death from liver failure ensued in wild type littermates. Animals heterozygous for ASMase deficiency were half-protected. This ceramide-mediated pathway could be bypassed in acid SMase knockout mice by supralethal doses (‚â•5 Œºg/25-g mouse) of the anti-Fas antibody, which induced hepatocyte apoptosis and animal death. The data indicated the existence of an alternative CD95-induced apoptotic pathway, which is less sensitive and independent of ceramide generation via ASMase activation. While the present studies do not define which of these pathways prevails in HeLa and 293T cells, they nonetheless define ceramide generation as an upstream product of CD95 signaling and not a by-product of cell disintegration during the terminal, effector phase of the apoptotic response."

In this study, we have investigated the regulation of Pyk2 by angiotensin II (Ang II) in pulmonary vein endothelial cells. We found that the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2, which requires the activity of Src family kinase, was specifically regulated by the Src family kinase member, Yes kinase. Moreover, we identified for the first time the constitutive association of Pyk2 with an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2. SHP-2 interacts with Pyk2 through a region other than its SH2 domains. Pyk2 can be dephosphorylated in vitro in SHP-2 immunoprecipitates and in intact cells expressing an NH2 terminus-truncated form of SHP-2, which lacks the two SH2 domains but has an enhanced phosphatase activity. Ang II activates the endogenous SHP-2. Finally, the SHP-2-mediated dephosphorylation of Pyk2 correlates with the negative effect of SHP-2 on the Ang II-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Thus, the balance of Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to Ang II is controlled by Yes kinase and by a tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in endothelial cells.

Angiotensin II (Ang II)1 type 1 receptor (AT1) belongs to the superfamily of heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). The AT1 receptor activates phospholipase CŒ≤ through Gq to generate inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol, which in turn releases calcium from intracellular stores and activates protein kinase C, respectively (2.Ushio-Fukai M.

In recent years, the AT1 receptor has been recognized to activate some key protein-tyrosine kinases and initiate cascades of phosphotyrosine phosphorylation, which in turn activates cellular migration, adhesion, and mitogenic and hypertrophic reactions (3.Marrero M.B.

These tyrosine kinases include Src family kinases, calcium-sensitive tyrosine kinase Pyk2, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), JAK kinases, and Tyk2.

Recent studies showed that the activated Src bound to Pyk2 may directly phosphorylate Pyk2 at Tyr-579, Tyr-580, and Tyr-881. In turn, this promotes Grb2 binding to Pyk2 and enhances Pyk2 kinase activity (15.Blaukat A. Ivankovic-Dikic I. Gronroos E. Dolfi F. Tokiwa G. Vuori K. Dikic I. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Co-expression experiments indicate that Pyk2 can be phosphorylated by Src family kinase members Src, Fyn, and Yes, but not by Lck (21.Li X. Dy R.C. Cance W.G. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8917-8924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In T cells, Pyk2 was found specifically associated with Fyn and was phosphorylated by Fyn during stimulation of T cell antigen receptor (22.Qian D. Lev S. van Oers N.S.C. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). It is likely that different members of Src family kinase may bind to Pyk2 and phosphorylate Pyk2 in response to different stimuli in different cell types. On the other hand, since tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 is transient in response to various stimuli, it seems reasonable to expect involvement of a phosphatase in the tight control of this signaling event. However, this issue has not been addressed as far as we know. We have recently reported the Fyn kinase-directed activation of the SH2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 by Gi-coupled receptors in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells (23.Tang H. Zhao Z.J. Huang X.-Y. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12401-12407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Among the Src family members (Src, Fyn, Lck, Yes, Lyn) present in MDCK cells, Fyn was the only one specifically associated with SHP-2 through an intermediary molecule which can be phosphorylated by a Src family kinase. This suggests that Pyk2 may likely be the intermediary molecule. SHP-2 (previously known as SH-PTP2, PTP1D, Syp, PTP2C, and SHPTP3), a protein-tyrosine phosphatase with two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains at the NH2 terminus, is expressed ubiquitously and is suggested to play an important role in the signal transduction of growth factor and insulin receptors (24.Byon J.C. Kenner K.A. Kusari A.B. Kusari J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 216: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A targeted deletion of 65 amino acids in the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 leads to an embryonic lethality at midgestation in homozygous mutant mice (25.Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). SHP-2 functions as either a positive or negative mitogenic regulator, depending on the specific receptor pathways stimulated (25.Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F.

Since the endothelium is now being recognized as a target of renin-angiotensin system and endothelial dysfunction plays important roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases, elucidation of the signal mechanisms of the endothelial AT1 receptor is essential for understanding the physiological and pathological effects of Ang II in endothelial cells. In the present study, we have investigated the regulation of Ang II-induced activation of Pyk2, a key tyrosine kinase in the early events of AT1 receptor signaling, using pulmonary vein endothelial cells. We found that the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 was regulated by Yes tyrosine kinase and by a tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in the endothelial cells. Furthermore, we have obtained evidence for the constitutive association of SHP-2 with Pyk2 in an SH2 domain-independent mechanism, which has not been reported as far as we are aware. Pyk2 can be dephosphorylated by SHP-2in vitro and in intact cells. SHP-2-mediated dephosphorylation of Pyk2 correlates with the negative effect of SHP-2 on the Ang II-induced ERK and JNK activation in the endothelial cells. Ang II and [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II were obtained from Peninsula Laboratories. The AT1 receptor antagonist losartan was a generous gift of DuPont Merck Pharmaceutical Co., and the AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 was purchased from Research Biochemical, Inc.. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were obtained from Millipore. Monoclonal antibody against phosphospecific JNK, and polyclonal antibodies against SHP-2 (C-18), Src (N-16), Fyn (FYN3), Yes, Lck, Lyn, and JNK2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal anti-Pyk2, anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20), and anti-SHP-2 antibodies were obtained from Transduction Laboratories. FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Polyclonal antibody to phosphospecific ERK, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and reagents for chemiluminescence detection were purchased from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were from Sigma. Rat pulmonary vein endothelial cells (PVEC) were kindly provided by Michael E. Mendelsohn (New England Medical Center, Boston, MA). PVECs were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum and grown overnight in a CO2 incubator at 37 ¬∞C to 70% confluence. PVECs were transfected with a catalytically inactive mutant of Src (kindly provided by S. A. Courtneidge, Sugen Inc.) or a catalytically inactive mutant of Fyn (23.Tang H. Zhao Z.J. Huang X.-Y. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12401-12407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's protocol. The recently developed FuGENE 6 reagent has been shown to produce high levels of transfection with minimal cytotoxicity for many eukaryotic cells. The NH2 terminus-truncated form of SHP-2, designated ŒîSH2SHP-2 (residues 192‚Äì593), which contains the COOH-terminal phosphatase domain but lacks the two SH2 domains at NH2 terminus, was generated by cleaving a full-length SHP-2 cDNA at a convenient BgIII site and re-ligating into pRC/CMV vector with an appropriate linker. The COOH terminus-truncated form of SHP-2, designated SH2(N+C), which contains both NH2- and COOH-terminal SH2 domains (residues 1‚Äì215) but lacks the COOH-terminal phosphatase domain, was generated by limited digestion of SHP-2 cDNA with XbaI and ScaI to give a fragment (residues 1‚Äì215) and subcloned into the pRc/CMV vector with an appropriate linker. Transfection was performed according to the standard calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique. To obtain stable cell lines, cells were selected in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418 sulfate, and single cell-derived colonies with high expression levels were obtained after 2‚Äì3 weeks. Cell cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared as described previously (31.Tang H. Guo G.F. Porter J.P. Wanaka Y. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 523-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Membranes were suspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 Œºg/ml each leupeptin and aprotinin). The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 √óg for 60 min, and the resulting supernatant was referred to as the solubilized membrane. All procedures were performed at 4 ¬∞C. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and then lysed on ice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The extract was clarified by centrifugation and incubated sequentially (4 h for each incubation at 4 ¬∞C) with antibodies as indicated and protein A-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were collected and washed four times with the lysis buffer. For immunoblotting, whole cell lysates or immnunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with various primary antibodies as indicated and detected using the ECL system with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies according to the manufacturer's protocol. SHP-2 immune complexes prepared from 50 Œºm pervanadate-treated cells were washed three times with vanadate-free Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and twice with dephosphorylation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and then incubated in the latter buffer for indicated time periods at 37 ¬∞C. Reactions were terminated by washing the immune complexes with ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 2 mmNa3VO4. Radioligand binding assay was performed as described previously (32.Tang H. Shirai H. Inagami T. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The binding of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, a peptidic AT1 receptor antagonist, to PVEC was dose-dependently inhibited by Ang II, [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II, and the AT1receptor-selective antagonist losartan with the potency order [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II > Ang II > losartan. In contrast, PD123319, an AT2 receptor-selective antagonist, had no effect on the binding of125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II. Scatchard analysis revealed that the dissociation constant (K d) of AT1 receptor in PVEC for125I-[Sar1,Ile8]Ang II is 1.0 nm, and the binding site number (B max) is 190 fmol/mg of protein. ThisK d value is in good agreement with that previously reported for the endothelial cells derived from different origins (33.Pueyo M.E. Michel J.B. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 29: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation is associated with an increase in its kinase activity (8.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P.

To determine the effect of Ang II on Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation, lysates from control- or Ang II-stimulated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) and subjected to immunoblotting with a Pyk2 antibody. As shown in Fig.1, A and B, Ang II even at physiological concentration (10 pm) markedly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. The stimulatory effect occurred very fast (<5 s), reached the maximal level at 30 s, and then declined. In agreement with previous reports (9.Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B.

Pretreatment of the cells with PP1 (34.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1790) Google Scholar), a selective Src family kinase inhibitor, markedly inhibited the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 (Fig.1 D). PP1 interacts specifically with Src family kinase and is a competitive inhibitor of ATP. PP1 selectively inhibits members of Src family kinase as compared with other tyrosine kinases such as ZAP-70, JAK2, and the EGF receptor (34.Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S.

These results indicate that the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 is dependent on intracellular calcium mobilization and requires the activity of Src family kinase in PVEC. Autophosphorylation of Pyk2 on Tyr-402 leads to binding of the SH2 domain of Src family kinases such as Src in PC12 cells and Fyn in T cells and their subsequent activation (14.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 22.Qian D. Lev S. van Oers N.S.C. Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1253-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The activated Src family kinase in turn phosphorylates Pyk2, generating docking sites for binding of additional signal proteins such as Grb2/Sos (14.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). We determined the association of Src family kinase with Pyk2 in response to Ang II in PVEC. As shown in Fig.2 A, among the Src family members (Src, Fyn, Lck, Yes) present in PVEC, Yes kinase was the only one specifically associated with Pyk2 in response to Ang II. We also found that Ang II did not induce the association of Lyn with Pyk2 in PVEC (data not shown). Fig. 2 B shows the time course of Ang II-induced association of Yes with Pyk2. The association of Yes with Pyk2 by Ang II peaked at 30 s and then declined gradually. Losartan, a selective AT1 receptor antagonist, blocked the Ang II-induced association of Yes with Pyk2. In contrast, an AT2 receptor antagonist PD123319 had no effect (Fig.2 B). Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 was inhibited by the selective Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, and Yes kinase was the only one specifically associated with Pyk2 in response to Ang II. This suggests that Yes may contribute to the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in PVEC. To confirm this hypothesis, we transfected PVEC with a catalytically inactive mutant of Src (SrcK‚àí) or Fyn (FynK‚àí) (23.Tang H. Zhao Z.J. Huang X.-Y. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12401-12407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and determined the Ang II-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2. As shown in Fig.3, overexpression of SrcK‚àíor FynK‚àí did not affect the Pyk2 tyrosine phosphorylation by Ang II. These data support the specific role of Yes kinase in the regulation of Pyk2 by Ang II in PVEC. Ang II causes a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in PVEC, suggesting involvement of a phosphatase in the regulation of Pyk2. We have recently reported a specific association of the Src family kinase member Fyn with SHP-2 upon stimulation of GPCR in MDCK cells. Fyn associates with SHP-2 through an intermediary protein that can be tyrosine-phosphorylated by a Src family kinase (23.Tang H. Zhao Z.J. Huang X.-Y. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12401-12407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To determine whether SHP-2 can interact with Pyk2 and to identity SHP-2-associated proteins in endothelial cells, cell cytosolic fraction and solubilized membrane from growing PVEC were prepared, immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal SHP-2 antibody, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine (PY20) as shown in Fig.4 A. A tyrosyl phosphoprotein band (116 kDa) and a 70-kDa band, which represents the phosphorylated SHP-2, were detected in SHP-2 immune complexes from the cytosolic fraction. The same blot was stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal anti-Pyk2 antibody. Pyk2 was detected in the SHP-2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 A). In an alternative experiment, SHP-2 is detected in the Pyk2 immunoprecipitates from the cytosolic fraction (data not shown). In the membrane fraction, three major phosphotyrosyl proteins, with apparent molecular masses of approximately 175, 116, and 97 kDa, were found associated with SHP-2. The 116-kDa protein was again identified as Pyk2. In addition, we identified the 97-kDa protein as the recently cloned SHP-2 substrate SIRP/SHPS-1 (35.Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) by a specific antibody to this protein (data not shown). The association of SHP-2 with Pyk2 was also observed in bovine pulmonary artery endothelial and rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) as shown in Fig. 4 B. We were unable to detect the association of SHP-2 with the Pyk2-related kinase FAK, or STAT2, or the p120 Src substrate in all the tested cells (data not shown). Such a modality of association of SHP-2 with Pyk2 has not been reported to date as far as we know. We next analyzed the mechanism of the interaction between SHP-2 and Pyk2. Pervanadate has been shown to enhance protein tyrosine phosphorylation (36.Zhao Z. Tan Z. Diltz C.D. You M. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22251-22255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, pretreatment of PVEC with 50 Œºmpervanadate for 20 min markedly increased the tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 and SHP-2; however, it did not affect the SHP-2 association with Pyk2. Fig. 4 D (left panel) shows that Ang II caused a rapid and robust tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 with a maximum at 30 s. However, amounts of Pyk2 bound to SHP-2 immunoprecipitates from quiescent and Ang II-treated cells were similar. Moreover, EGF and serum, which have been reported to activate and promote the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 (37.Feng G.S Hui C.C Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar), did not alter the association of SHP-2 with Pyk2 in PVEC (Fig. 4 D,right panel). Pyk2, like FAK, lacks SH2 and SH3 domains; in contrast, SHP-2 contains two SH2 domains at the NH2terminus (8.Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B.

Med. 1997; 216: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data indicate that the association of SHP-2 with Pyk2 is not mediated by the SH2 domains of SHP-2 because their interaction is not affected by tyrosine phosphoryl"

In our study we observed that selenite protects HEK293 cells from cell death induced by ultraviolet B radiation (UVB). Exposure of HEK293 cells to UVB radiation resulted in the activation of caspase-3-like protease activity, and pretreatment of the cells with z-DEVD-fmk (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone), a caspase-3 inhibitor, prevented UVB-induced cell death. Interestingly, enzymatic activity of caspase-3-like protease in cell lysates of UVB-exposed cells was repressed in vitro by the presence of selenite. Selenite also inhibited the in vitro activity of purified recombinant caspase-3 in cleaving Ac-DEVD-pNA (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Asp-p-nitroanilide) or ICADL (inhibitor of a caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease) and in the induction of DNA fragmentation. The inhibitory action of selenite on a recombinant active caspase-3 could be reversed by sulfhydryl reducing agents, such as dithiothreitol and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol. Furthermore, pretreatment of cells with selenite suppressed the stimulation of the caspase-3-like protease activity in UVB-exposed cells, whereas dithiothreitol and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol reversed this suppression of the enzymatic activity. Taken together, our data suggest that selenite inhibits caspase-3-like protease activity through a redox mechanism and that inhibition of caspase-3-like protease activity may be the mechanism by which selenite exerts its protective effect against UVB-induced cell death.

Apoptosis is a cell suicide process with characteristic morphological features that include nuclear membrane breakdown, chromatin condensation and fragmentation, cell membrane blebbing, and the formation of apoptotic bodies (18.Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 19.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6138) Google Scholar). Many apoptotic stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-Œ±, the Fas ligand, UV light, and chemotherapeutic agents have been shown to induce cell death by activating caspases (18.Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that are major components of the cellular apoptotic machinery. Caspases cleave a number of intracellular proteins after aspartic acid residues. These proteins include lamins, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), fodrin, gelsolin, p21-activated kinase 2, protein kinase C, MEKK1, amyloid Œ≤-precursor protein, and presenilins (20.Mashima T.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of selenite on UVB-induced cell death, and we focused on caspase-3 activation to understand the mechanism for the anti-death function of selenite. We demonstrate in this report that selenite inhibits both cell death and caspase-3 activation induced by UVB. Selenite also suppresses the catalytic activity of caspase-3 and caspase-3-induced DNA fragmentationin vitro. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the inhibitory action of selenite on caspase-3 occurs through a redox mechanism. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were routinely maintained at 37 ¬∞C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. When indicated, cells in culture were exposed to chemicals or to ultraviolet B radiation (UVB; 280‚Äì320 nm) at 37 ¬∞C. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method. To prepare the S-100 fraction, HEK293 cells were resuspended in a ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm EGTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 Œºg/ml leupeptin, and 2 Œºg/ml aprotinin. They were then homogenized on ice using a Dounce homogenizer. The cell lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 1000 √ó g for 10 min at 4 ¬∞C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The soluble fraction was further centrifuged at 100,000 √ó g for 1 h at 4 ¬∞C. The resultant soluble fraction (S-100 fraction) was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ‚àí70 ¬∞C until used for in vitroDNA fragmentation experiments. To prepare the nuclei fraction, HEK293 cells were resuspended in buffer A containing 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 mm sucrose and allowed to swell on ice for 20 min. They were then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and the homogenates were subjected to centrifugation at 1000 √ó g for 10 min at 4 ¬∞C. The resultant soluble fraction was layered over buffer A containing 2.3 mm sucrose in a Beckman SW28 centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 22,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 ¬∞C. The pellet containing nuclei was resuspended in buffer A and immediately used inin vitro DNA fragmentation experiments. Cultured cells were lysed with a lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 Œºmdigitonin. The soluble fraction of the cell lysate was then assayed for caspase-3 activity using Ac-DEVD-pNA (CLONTECH), a colorimetric substrate for caspase-3, as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were exposed to indicated agents, harvested, and lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm Œ≤-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, and 5 mm EGTA. Nuclear DNA was extracted from the cell lysates as described previously (34.Preston G.A Barrett J.C. Biermann J.A. Murphy E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 537-542PubMed Google Scholar). Fragmented DNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. In the in vitro DNA fragmentation assay, recombinant human caspase-3 (100 ng, Pharmingen) was added to 80 Œºl of reaction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 40 mm Œ≤-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 50 Œºg/ml creatine kinase, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and then incubated with 200 Œºl of the S-100 fraction (‚àº1 mg/ml) and 10 Œºl of the nuclei fraction (‚àº2 √ó 108 nuclei) at 37 ¬∞C for 140 min. The DNA was extracted and analyzed for fragmentation as described above. Recombinant GST-ICADL fusion protein was incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 1 h with 100 ng of active caspase-3 (Pharmingen) in a reaction buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 20% glycerol. The reaction mixture was then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis through a 12% polyacrylamide gel, and cleaved GST-ICADL was visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. The GST-ICADL was bacterially expressed using pGEX-4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and purified on glutathione-agarose. HEK293 cells were harvested and broken using a 26-gauge syringe in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 Œºg/ml leupeptin, and 2 Œºg/ml aprotinin. The cell lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 12,000 √ó g for 10 min at 4 ¬∞C. The soluble fraction was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gel. Twenty micrograms of the soluble fraction was loaded/lane. The separated proteins were then electroblotted onto a Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoanalysis was performed with a mouse anti-PARP monoclonal antibody (C-2‚Äì10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. The cleaved PARP was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Initially we investigated a possible role for selenite during cell death induced by UVB radiation. Exposure of HEK293 cells to 160 J/m2 UVB resulted in 80% cell death within 24 h (Fig.1 A). The UVB-induced cell death was markedly prevented by pretreatment of the cells with 100 nm sodium selenite. We also found that exposure of HEK293 cells to UVB resulted in apoptotic DNA fragmentation and that selenite prevented this UVB-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 B). We then looked for possible mechanism by which selenite might suppress cell death induced by UVB irradiation. Exposure of cells to UVB has been shown to induce activation of the proapoptotic proteins including caspases (35.Kulms D. Poppelmann B. Yarosh D. Luger T.A. Krutmann J. Schwarz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7974-7979Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 36.Shimizu H. Banno Y. Sumi N. Naganawa T. Kitajima Y. Nozawa Y. J. Invest.

Res. 1999; 249: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Indeed, the enzymatic activity of a caspase-3-like protease was markedly enhanced after HEK293 cells had been exposed to UVB (Fig.2 A). We, therefore, tested whether caspase-3 was involved in the UV-induced cell death. HEK293 cells were pretreated with either a relatively general caspase inhibitor, z-VAD, or a caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD, and then exposed to UVB. We then determined cell viability by trypan blue staining (Fig.2 B). UV-induced cell death was prevented efficiently by z-DEVD but not by z-VAD. These data suggest that a caspase-3-like protease is associated with a mechanism that leads to UVB-induced cell death in HEK293 cells. To further investigate the suppressive effect of selenite on UVB-induced cell death, we examined whether selenite would suppress the UVB-stimulated caspase-3 activity. As expected, exposure of cells to UVB led to enhanced caspase-3-like protease activity in the cell lysate (Fig.3). Interestingly, treatment of the lysate of UVB-exposed cells with selenite resulted in a decrease in the caspase-3-like protease activity in these cell lysates (Fig. 3). Thein vitro inhibitory action of selenite on the caspase-3-like protease activity thus suggests that selenite may modify caspase-3 activity by directly acting on the enzyme. In fact, it has been shown previously that selenite can modulate the functions of various proteins by directly acting on reactive cysteine residues of these proteins (26.Rudel T. Bokoch G.M. Science. 1997; 276: 1571-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar,27.Frutos S. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). If selenite suppresses the catalytic activity of caspase-3 through modifying critical cysteine residues on the enzyme, the action of selenite on caspase-3 could be reversible by sulfhydryl-reducing agents. We tested this possibility using reducing agents such as dithiothreitol (DTT), Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, and glutathione (Fig.4). In vitro treatment of purified recombinant caspase-3 with 100 nm selenite resulted in dramatic inhibition of the enzymatic activity (Fig.4 A). Furthermore, DTT and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol reversed the inhibitory action of selenite on caspase-3. Glutathione did not affect the inhibitory action of selenite. We also examined the effect of selenite on the in vitrocleavage of ICADL by caspase-3. ICADL is an inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase, an enzyme responsible for the induction of DNA fragmentation during apoptotic cell death. Caspase-3 cleaved ICADL in vitro, and this cleavage was blocked by selenite (Fig. 4 B). Inhibition of the ICADL cleavage by selenite was reversed by DTT and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that selenite suppresses enzymatic activity of caspase-3 through oxidizing critical sulfhydryl groups on the enzyme and that the reducing agents DTT and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol can reverse the selenite-induced oxidation of the redox-sensitive cysteine residues of caspase-3. We also examined the effect of selenite on in vitro DNA fragmentation stimulated by caspase-3 (Fig. 4 C). For the in vitro DNA fragmentation experiment, intact nuclei and a cytosolic S-100 fraction were prepared from HEK293 cells. Incubation of the S-100 fraction and the isolated nuclei with caspase-3 resulted in DNA fragmentation. The caspase-3-dependent DNA fragmentation was suppressed in the presence of selenite, and the inhibitory effect of selenite was reversible by either DTT or Œ≤-mercaptoethanol. Other thiol reactive agents such as N-ethylmaleimide, azodicarboxylic acid bisdimethylamide, and o-iodosobenzoate also repressed the caspase-3-dependent DNA fragmentation (Fig. 4 C). We examined whether selenite could inhibit intracellular caspase-3-like protease activity in intact cells. Exposure of HEK293 cells to UVB-stimulated caspase-3-like protease activity and pretreatment of the cells with 100 nm selenite resulted in suppression of the UVB-stimulated caspase-3-like protease activity (Fig. 5 A). The inhibitory effect of selenite on the intracellular caspase-3-like protease activity was attenuated by DTT and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol but not by glutathione. One physiological substrate for caspase-3 is PARP, a 116-kDa protein, which can be cleaved into 85- and 31-kDa fragments during apoptotic cell death (38.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). We examined whether selenite could suppress PARP cleavage by caspase-3-like protease in vivo. PARP cleavage was detected after HEK293 cells were exposed to UVB radiation (Fig.5 B). Pretreatment of cells with 100 nm selenite completely blocked the UVB-induced PARP cleavage. Our data thus suggest that selenite inhibited caspase-3-like protease activity in the intact cells. In the present study, we show that exposure of cells to UVB induces the activation of a caspase-3-like protease activity as well as cell death, whereas z-DEVD, a caspase-3 inhibitor, can effectively block the UVB-induced cell death. These observations suggest that a caspase-3-like protease is a major component of the cellular machinery leading to UVB-induced cell death. Participation of the caspase-3-like protease in UVB-induced cell death had been demonstrated previously (36.Shimizu H. Banno Y. Sumi N. Naganawa T. Kitajima Y. Nozawa Y. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 769-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 37.Takahashi H. Nakamura S. Asano K. Kinouchi M. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Iizuka H. Exp. Cell. Res. 1999; 249: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that selenite treatment suppresses both cell death and DNA fragmentation induced by UVB radiation. Furthermore, selenite also prevented the stimulation of the caspase-3-like protease activity and PARP cleavage that occurs in UVB-exposed cells. PARP is one of the well studied physiological substrates of caspase-3 (38.Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3782) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that inhibition of the caspase-3-like protease activity may be a major mechanism by which selenite treatment protects HEK293 cells from UVB-induced cell death. Caspases are cysteine proteases that contain cysteine in their catalytic domain (39.Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2133) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies have shown that replacement of cysteine in the active site with other amino acid abolishes the catalytic activity of caspases (40.Wilson K.P. Black J.A. Thomson J.A. Kim E.E. Griffith J.P. Navia M.A. Murcko M.A. Chambers S.P. Aldape R.A. Raybuck S.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 270-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 was lost when reactive thiol groups on the enzyme were modified chemically (41.Zech B. Wilm M. van Eldik R. Brune B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20931-20936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It is interesting in this context that selenite is capable of oxidizing thiol groups on proteins (1.Handel M.L. Watts C.K. deFazio A. Day R.O. Sutherland R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4497-4501Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 2.Spyrou G. Bjornstedt M. Kumar S. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 3.Kim I.Y.

Biophys. 1997; 348: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We proposed, therefore, that at least one mechanism by which selenite treatment can prevent the caspase-3-like protease activation is the oxidation of critical cysteine residues on the caspase-3-like protease. This hypothesis is consistent with our data using thiol reducing agents, DTT and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol. Both DTT and Œ≤-mercaptoethanol prevented the inhibitory effect of selenite on caspase-3 activity in cleaving the substrate, Ac-DEVD-pNA. The reducing agents also reversed the suppression by selenite of caspase-3-inducedin vitro DNA fragmentation. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, which has been long considered a biochemical hallmark of apoptosis, appears to occur at a late stage in many of the apoptotic events. There are accumulating lines of evidence that caspases play a pivotal role in the activation of nuclear DNA fragmentation (19.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6138) Google Scholar, 42.Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). Caspases, especially caspase-3, have been shown to activate a caspase-activated DNase (CAD/DFF40) through cleaving its inhibitor (ICAD/DFF45) (24.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A.

In our study, exposure of cells to UVB resulted in the stimulation of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and the UVB-induced DNA fragmentation could be prevented by pretreatment of cells with z-DEVD (data not shown). This suggests that a caspase-3-like protease is associated with the mechanism that operates in the UVB-induced DNA fragmentation. Recombinant active caspase-3 protein also enhanced the in vitro DNA fragmentation in isolated nuclei of HEK293 cells. Pretreatment of caspase-3 with selenite resulted in suppression of the in vitro DNA fragmentation activated by caspase-3. These data suggest that inhibition of the caspase-3-like protease activity may be an important mechanism by which selenite represses the UVB-induced nuclear DNA fragmentation. Selenite and other selenium compounds modulate a variety of cellular activities including cell survival and death (47.Greeder G.A. Milner J.A. Science. 1980; 209: 825-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 48.Milner J.A. Hsu C.Y. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 1652-1656PubMed Google Scholar, 49.Borek C. Ong A. Mason H. Donahue L.

Our findings in this study that selenite suppresses caspase-3-like protease activity through a redox mechanism may contribute significantly to a better understanding of the mechanism by which selenite participates in functions of cell survival and cell death. However, whether selenite also modulates other types of caspases besides caspase-3 with this kind of mechanism still needs to be investigated. We thank G. Hoschek for critical reading of the manuscript."

Analysis of the photolysis and hydrolysis FTIR spectra of the [Œ≤-nonbridge-18O2, Œ±Œ≤-bridge-18O]GTP isotopomer allowed us to probe for positional isotope exchange. Such a reaction might signal the existence of metaphosphate as a discrete intermediate, a key species for a dissociative mechanism. No positional isotope exchange was observed. Overall, our results support a concerted mechanism, but the transition state seems to have a considerable amount of dissociative character.

The signal is transmitted by the Ras-GTP complex, and hydrolysis of GTP to GDP turns the signal off. The intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate is rather low, and it is greatly enhanced by GTPase-activating proteins. Numerous studies have been devoted to the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis by Ras in the presence or absence of GTPase-activating protein. Despite extensive structural, kinetic, and site-directed mutagenesis data, no consensus regarding key mechanistic aspects of catalysis by Ras has thus far been reached (4.Maegley K.A. Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14232-14243Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The transition states for phosphoryl transfer reactions, which ATP and GTP hydrolysis are examples of, are usually described by a structure somewhere between dissociative and associative extremes (6.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). In the fully dissociative mechanism, reactions proceed via a metaphosphate intermediate, which is subsequently attacked by the nucleophile. In contrast, a fully associative mechanism involves a trigonal bipyramidal intermediate, followed by the departure of the leaving group. Between these two limits exist concerted pathways featuring trigonal bipyramidal transition states with no distinct intermediate. For GTP hydrolysis by Ras, several distinct models have been developed to explain the biochemical and mutagenesis data (4.Maegley K.A. Admiraal S.J. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vibrational spectroscopy can provide detailed, mechanistically important information about the structures of substrate(s), cofactor(s), even transition state analog bound to the enzymes. Time-resolved vibrational spectroscopy has been established as a valuable tool to study kinetics of enzymatic reactions. In the case of Ras, two studies employing vibrational spectroscopy have appeared in the literature (24.Cepus V. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10263-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 25.Wang J.H. Xiao D.G. Deng H. Webb M.R. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11106-11116Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A TR-FTIR1 study on NPE-GTP-Ras has revealed strong binding between the Ras and Œ≤-PO2‚àí group of Ras-bound GTP, which led to the suggestion that the transition state is dissociative (24.Cepus V. Scheidig A.J. Goody R.S. Gerwert K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10263-10271Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A Raman study provided an independent vibrational assignment and semiempirical vibrational analysis to simulate the band shifts of Œ≥-PO32‚àí group. On the basis of the simulation result, the formation of a weak bond between the attacking water molecule and the Œ≥-phosphorus atom was proposed (25.Wang J.H. Xiao D.G. Deng H. Webb M.R. Callender R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11106-11116Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we report our results on GTP hydrolysis by Ras using time-resolved FTIR spectroscopy. Four nucleotides, [Œ±-nonbridge-18O2]GTP ([Œ±-18O2]GTP), [Œ≤-nonbridge18O2, Œ±Œ≤-bridge-18O, Œ≤Œ≥-bridge-18O]GTP ([Œ≤-18O4]GTP), [Œ≥-nonbridge-18O3]GTP ([Œ≥-18O3]GTP), and [Œ≤-nonbridge-18O2, Œ±Œ≤-bridge-18O]GTP ([Œ≤-18O3]GTP) were synthesized. Each was caged by the NPE group and prepared as caged nucleotide-Ras complex. IR spectroscopy following the photolysis of NPE-[Œ±-18O2]GTP, NPE-[Œ≤-18O4]GTP, or NPE-[Œ≥-18O3]GTP bound to Ras allowed a complete assignment of phosphoryl group absorptions. Hydroxyphenylacyl (HPA)-GTP and HPA-GDP were also synthesized and employed in the IR study involving Ras mutants. The photolysis chemistry of NPE-GTP and HPA-GTP is shown in Scheme FS1. The band shifts of the vibrational modes of GTP or GDP bound to Ras mutants compared with that bound to wild type Ras were discussed in the context of the mechanism of GTP hydrolysis. We also employed TR-FTIR to probe the positional isotope exchange (PIX) in the process of [Œ≤-18O3]GTP hydrolysis by Ras (SchemeFS2). The observation of a PIX reaction would reveal reversible cleavage of PŒ≥‚ÄìOŒ≤Œ≥-bridge bond and signal the existence of either metaphosphate (26.Cullis P.M. Nicholls D. J. Chem. Soc. Chem.

Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4748-4754Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as a reaction intermediate. Thus far only 31P NMR and mass spectrometry have been employed for the detection of the PIX reactions (28.Cohn M. Hu A. J. Am. Chem.

Native channels consist of a heteromeric receptor composed of four subunits (1.Rosenmund C. Stern-Bach Y. Stevens C.F. Science. 1998; 280: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). A family of four different subunits (GluR1, -2, -3, and -4) can contribute to the formation of AMPA receptors, and each subunit can form functional homomeric channels (2.Seeburg P.H. Trends Neurosci. 1993; 16: 359-365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 3.Hollmann M. Heinemann S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 31-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3658) Google Scholar). A related subunit, GluRŒ¥2, with 25% homology to AMPA receptors, is found in cerebellar Purkinje cells; a spontaneous mutation of the GluRŒ¥2 subunit is responsible for the neurodegenerative phenotype of the Lurcher mouse (4.Kashiwabuchi N. Ikeda K. Araki K. Hirano T. Shibuki K. Takayama C. Inoue Y. Kutsuwada T. Yagi T. Kang Y. Cell. 1995; 81: 245-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 5.Zuo J. De Jager P.L. Takahashi K.A. Jiang W. Linden D.J. Heintz N. Nature. 1997; 388: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The GluRŒ¥2 subunit cannot form functional heteromeric channels (6.Lomeli H.

Kutsuwada T. Kashiwabuchi N. Ikeda K. Nagasawa M. Yamazaki M. Masaki H. Yamakura T. Morita T. Sakimura K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 707: 136-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), but spontaneously gated currents can be recorded in the absence of an agonist for the Lurcher mutation (GluRŒ¥2-Lc) (5.Zuo J. De Jager P.L. Takahashi K.A. Jiang W. Linden D.J. Heintz N. Nature. 1997; 388: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). In this mutation, a substitution of a non-polar alanine with polar threonine occurs at position 654. This alanine is also conserved across a wide variety of glutamate receptors including the AMPA receptor subunits. It was postulated that neurons are lost in Lurcher mice as a consequence of spontaneous gating of GluRŒ¥2-Lc channels and the resulting chronic depolarization (5.Zuo J. De Jager P.L. Takahashi K.A. Jiang W. Linden D.J. Heintz N. Nature. 1997; 388: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The GluRŒ¥2-Lc mutation is of particular interest because it demonstrates that an apparently nonfunctional channel can be converted to a functional one simply by a point mutation in or near the putative second transmembrane region. Mutational analysis of AMPA receptor gating has been targeted primarily to regions of the N terminus as well as the extracellular loop (8.Swanson G.T. Gereau R.W. Green T. Heinemann S.F. Neuron. 1997; 19: 913-926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), but little attention has been paid to the possible role of the second transmembrane region in the gating of AMPA channels. To explore the possible role of this region in channel gating, we constructed a mutated GluR1 (flop) subunit with a threonine substituted for the alanine (A636T, GluR1-Lc) at the homologous position of the Lurcher mutation of the GluRŒ¥2 subunit. We report here that the GluR1-Lc mutation has a profound effect on function of the GluR1 homomeric channel, converting an antagonist into an agonist and enhancing agonist potency. We introduced the Lurcher mutation into the analogous site of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (GenBankTM accession number X7184, RNGLUR1) (9.Hollmann M. O'Shea-Greenfield A. Rogers S.W. Heinemann S. Nature. 1989; 342: 643-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following primer: CAA CCT GGC TAC CTT CCT GAC (Fig. 1). The mutation converted alanine at position 636 to threonine. The mutated cDNA was subcloned to the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), and the open reading frame was sequenced in its entirety to ensure that only the Lurcher mutation was introduced. cDNA was grown and purified with Qiaprep columns (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) and used for direct injection into oocytes or for in vitro translation. The cDNAs for wild-type GluR1 (GluR1-wt) or GluR1-Lc in the pCDNA3 vector were injected (10 ng) directly into the nucleus of stage V or VIXenopus oocytes, or the cDNAs were in vitrotranscribed with T7 RNA polymerase using an RNA transcription kit (Ambion) after linearization of the cDNAs with XhoI; 30 ng of RNA was then injected into the cytoplasm of the oocytes. Adult female Xenopus laevis were anesthetized with 0.15% aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. The ovarian tissue was dissected and treated with 0.2% collagenase (Sigma) for 2 h in Ca2+-free solution and subsequently defolliculated using fine forceps. Recordings were made from oocytes 3‚Äì6 days after the injection of cDNAs or cRNAs using conventional two-electrode, voltage clamp methods. The external bath was perfused with Ringer's solution contained (in mm): 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 Ca2+, 1.0 Mg2+, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4. For EGTA-injected oocytes, 50 nl of 100 mm EGTA was injected into the cytoplasm 1 h before electrophysiological recordings. In some experiments, all extracellular Na+ and K+was replaced with impermeantN-methyl-d-glucosamine (NMDG). All comparisons were made using Student's paired t test or two-way analysis of variance. GluR1-wt and GluR1-Lc cDNAs (3 Œºg of cDNA/35-mm culture dish) were transfected using the Perfect Lipid Method (Invitrogen). Cells were plated to a density of about 106 cells/35-mm dish, and after 24 h they were transfected with the appropriate cDNAs. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made 24‚Äì48 h after transfection using conventional techniques. Oocytes expressing the GluR1-wt subunit (n > 100) demonstrated an inward current (Fig.2 A, left), which decreased in amplitude as the oocytes recovered from insertion of the electrodes. Small inward currents were evoked from these oocytes in response to near saturating concentrations of glutamate (1 mm) relative to the agonist kainate (100 Œºm) (Fig. 2 B) (n = 65). This difference in amplitude reflects the more limited desensitization of these receptors by kainate (10.Bettler B. Mulle C. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The amplitudes of kainate-evoked currents remained constant over the period of recording. Oocytes expressing the GluR1-Lc subunit (n>100) demonstrated larger initial inward currents that slowly inactivated over a period of 15 to 60 min (Fig. 2 A, right). Furthermore, the superimposed peak responses evoked by glutamate or kainate slowly declined in parallel with the decay of this inward current (not shown). Each response to agonist also desensitized during the application of agonist (Fig. 2, B and C) (n = 75). This agonist-induced decay of currents exceeded that attributable to the spontaneous decay of the initial inward currents. Indeed, the cessation of each application of agonist was associated with an acceleration of inactivation that was manifest as a net outward current (Fig. 2 C, and see below). The relative responsiveness to glutamate and kainate was also altered (Fig.2 C). Qualitatively, responses to glutamate were nearly as large as those to kainate (n = 35), and quantitatively there was a more than 3-fold increase in the ratio of glutamate to kainate-evoked currents for GluR1-Lc channels (Iglutamate/Ikainate = 0.26 ¬± 0.03, wild type; Iglutamate/Ikainate = 0.78 ¬± 0.05 GluR1-Lc; n = 4). The spontaneous current present in oocytes expressing GluRŒ¥2-Lc can be suppressed by substituting Na+ and K+ with the impermeant cation NMDG. The initial inward current recorded from oocytes expressing GluR1-Lc channels in the absence of applied agonist was also suppressed (Fig. 2 E1) by this substitution (Fig. 2,E1 and E2). We also tested the noncompetitive AMPA channel blockers GYKI 52466 (n = 6) andN-(4-hydroxyphenylpropanoyl)spermine (HPP-SB; not shown) (11.Mainen Z.F. Jia Z. Roder J. Malinow R. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) against this inward current. Applications of GYKI 52466 depressed this inward current (Fig. 2 G), confirming that GluR1-Lc channels mediated the initial inward current observed in the absence of applied agonist (n = 45). Applications of these blockers also reversibly depressed kainate-evoked responses (Fig. 2 F). The potency of GYKI 52466 appeared to be less for GluR1-Lc than for responses of GluR1-wt channels; however, this observation must take into account the substantial increase in the potency of kainate observed for GluR1-Lc responses (see below). We next examined the possible mechanism of the slow inactivation of currents in oocytes expressing GluR1-Lc channels. Agonist-induced inactivation is shown quantitatively in Fig.3, A and B; and we initially considered that it might depend upon extracellular Ca2+. Extracellular Ca2+ was therefore replaced with Ba2+, a cation that usually does not substitute for Ca2+ in inactivation of channels. This substitution reversibly blocked the slow inactivation observed in oocytes expressing GluR1-Lc channels (Fig. 3, C and D) (n = 20). Ba2+ substitution also prevented the slow inactivation of the initial inward current. Oocytes were then injected with EGTA for the purpose of chelating Ca2+entering through the GluR1-wt and GluR1-Lc channels. Injections of EGTA did not obviously alter kainate responses in oocytes expressing GluR1-wt but blocked the slow inactivation of kainate-evoked currents observed for GluR1-Lc channels. The influx of Ca2+ through GluR1-wt and GluR1-Lc channels also causes a secondary activation of Ca2+-dependent Cl‚àí currents (12.Leonard J.P. Kelso S.R. Neuron. 1990; 4: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar,13.Logan S.M. Rivera F.E. Leonard J.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 974-986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These Cl‚àí currents are inward under our recording conditions, inactivate rapidly, and contribute to the peak seen at the beginning of agonist application (see Fig. 2 F) (12.Leonard J.P. Kelso S.R. Neuron. 1990; 4: 53-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 13.Logan S.M. Rivera F.E. Leonard J.P. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 974-986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, these currents are unlikely to be responsible for the observed slow inactivation of GluR1-Lc-mediated currents. To determine whether the Lurcher mutation had altered binding and/or gating of the receptors, we constructed concentration-response relationships for kainate and glutamate. These were done in Ba2+-substituted solution to prevent slow inactivation (Fig. 4, A and B). In comparison with oocytes expressing GluR1-wt channels, those expressing GluR-Lc demonstrated responses that were more that 80 times more sensitive to kainate (GluR1-wt; EC50 = 71 Œºm; GluR1-Lc, EC50 = 0.8 Œºm) and almost 2000-fold more sensitive to glutamate (GluR1-wt; EC50 = 331 Œºm; GluR1-Lc, EC50 = 0.2 Œºm). It should be noted that our EC50value for glutamate-evoked currents from GluR1-wt channels cannot simply be equated to the affinity of the desensitized state of the receptor, as it also reflects the kinetics of recovery and re-entry into desensitized states. The dramatic increase in the potency for glutamate of GluR1-Lc suggests that contaminating glutamate in the extracellular solution might have been sufficient to activate these channels and generate inward currents. For this reason, free concentrations of glutamate in our bathing solutions before and after electrode penetration of oocytes were measured in a static bath using high pressure liquid chromatography. Final bath concentrations of glutamate were below detectable values in our extracellular solutions but increased to measurable values following electrode insertion (35‚Äì150 nm). Therefore, glutamate is released upon electrode insertion, and concentrations would be sufficient to activate GluR1-Lc channels. During experiments designed to determine the potency of the competitive AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), we were surprised to discover that applications of the antagonist itself activated GluR1-Lc channels (Fig. 4). As anticipated, this compound antagonized responses of GluR1-wt to kainate (Fig. 4 C) and glutamate without activating currents on its own. In contrast, CNQX-evoked currents for GluR1-Lcchannels demonstrated similar properties of rectification, as did responses to glutamate and kainate (Fig. 4 D). Responses to CNQX were also blocked by GYKI 52466 (not shown), and CNQX appeared more potent (EC50 = 53 nm) as an agonist of GluR1-Lc receptors than kainate itself. To determine whether the properties of GluR1-Lc channels were dependent upon the expression system (i.e. oocytes), we also examined responses to kainate and CNQX in HEK293 cells transfected with GluR1-wt or GluR1-Lc cDNAs. Kainate-evoked currents in cells expressing GluR1-wt were blocked by applications of CNQX, and CNQX never evoked any inward current on its own (n = 10). However, as we had observed with oocytes, CNQX or kainate applications both evoked inward currents in cells expressing GluR1-Lc(Fig. 4 F) (n = 8). In contrast to recordings in oocytes, we failed to record any spontaneous inward currents from HEK293 cells expressing GluR1-Lc channels. In summary, GluR1-Lc-mediated currents demonstrated a slow inactivation in response to prolonged applications of agonist that was not seen with GluR1-wt channels. GluR1-Lc channels also mediated the initial inward current, and this current slowly inactivated in the absence of applied agonist. Applications of agonist also accelerated the slow inactivation of the initial inward current, and both forms of inactivation were dependent upon an influx of Ca2+ through GluR1-Lc channels, as the removal of extracellular Ca2+ and enhanced chelation of intracellular Ca2+ reduced both. Even more striking were the dramatic increases in the potency of both kainate and glutamate for GluR1-Lc receptors as well as the conversion of the competitive antagonist CNQX into a potent agonist. Both of these actions are strikingly similar to results reported for single-site mutations within the second transmembrane region of the Œ±7 cholinergic receptor (14.Bertrand D. Devillers-ThieÃÅry A. Revah F. Galzi J.-L. Hussy N. Mulle C. Bertrand S. Ballivet M. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1261-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Point mutations converted antagonists to agonists and also increased the potency of agonist. It was suggested that such mutations stabilize the desensitized forms of the receptor in an open channel conformation. Such an interpretation is consistent with our observations that GluR1-Lc channels are much more sensitive to agonist, perhaps reflecting the much higher affinity of the desensitized state. Whether these changes primarily reflect alterations in the binding of the agonist to the receptor or a change in gating remains to be determined (15.Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). The high potency of glutamate (EC50 = 170 nm) for GluR1-Lc channels together with the release of glutamate from oocytes may account for our observation of the initial inward current. This interpretation was supported by the lack of such currents in HEK293 cells expressing these channels. It seems reasonable to speculate that the GluRŒ¥2 Lurcher mutation might also demonstrate similar high potency for glutamate. Ambient concentrations of glutamate (16.Sah P. Hestrin S. Nicoll R.A. Science. 1989; 246: 815-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) in vivo would then be sufficient to continuously activate mutant channels. The Lurcher mutation occurs in a region in or adjacent to channel pore and links the pore with the extracellular loop containing the S2 segment. Activation of AMPA and kainate receptors by glutamate is thought to involve an initial binding of this amino acid to the S1 segment in the N terminus, followed by interactions with the S2 segment of the extracellular loop (17.Mano I. Lamed Y. Teichberg V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15299-15302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Upon the binding of glutamate, the two lobes of the channel formed by the S1 and S2 segments may move together, perhaps accounting for agonist trapping and desensitization (18.Benveniste M. Mayer M.L. J. Physiol. (Lond). 1995; 483: 367-384Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A single-site mutation in the S1 region of GluR3 (L507Y) is sufficient to eliminate desensitization without changing most other properties of binding and channel gating (19.Stern-Bach Y. Russo S. Neuman M. Rosenmund C. Neuron. 1998; 21: 907-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This finding implies that an interaction of agonist with the S1 region is sufficient for both agonist binding and channel gating. It seems reasonable to suggest that in GlurRŒ¥2 and AMPA receptors, an alanine that lies at a key and homologous site near the second transmembrane region is critical for maintaining the physical relationships between agonist binding and channel gating.

It is generally accepted that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can inhibit ENaC activity and aggravate acute lung injury; however, the molecular mechanism for free radical-mediated ENaC inhibition is unclear. Previously, we showed that the expression of the Œ±-subunit of ENaC,Œ±-ENaC, which is indispensable for ENaC activity, is repressed by Ras activation in salivary epithelial cells.

In addition, overexpression of thioredoxin restored glucocorticoid receptor action on the Œ±-ENaC GRE in the presence of exogenous H2O2.

Skulachev V.P. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 174: 305-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, reactive oxygen species have also been demonstrated to participate in physiological or cellular responses in both signaling pathway activation and gene regulation (1.Suzuki Y.J.

For example, the intracellular H2O2 level increases following stimulation with platelet-derived growth factor and is proposed to mediate the physiological response of platelet-derived growth factor (4.Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X.

Moreover, both endogenous and exogenous H2O2 have been reported to activate transcription factors nuclear factor-Œ∫B and AP-11 (5.Kaul N. Forman H.J. Free Radical Biol.

Consequently, oxidative stress mediates the induction of a family of AP-1- and nuclear factor-Œ∫B-dependent genes, such asHemeoxygenase-1 and Cyclooxygenase-2 (11.Adderley S.R. Fitzgerald D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5038-5046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 12.Hartsfield C.L. Alam J. Cook J.L. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: L980-L988PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, little is known about the role of specific signal transduction pathway(s) in targeting oxidative stress-mediated gene repression. The cellular response to diverse external stimuli is generally governed by a complex array of phosphorylation cascades. The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase cascades are three major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) subfamilies that modulate various cell programs, including differentiation, proliferation, movement, and apoptosis (see Ref. 13.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar for a review). All MAP kinases are proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases, each capable of responding to different stimuli, such as growth factors and cellular stress (Refs. 13.Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholarand 14.Davis R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar and references therein). For example, enhanced ERK activity has been implicated in growth factor-mediated cell survival and/or proliferation. The p38 and JNK cascades are primarily activated by environmental stress, such as proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-Œ± and interleukin-1), osmotic shock, UV, heat shock, and protein synthesis inhibitors. Withdrawal of nerve growth factor from PC12 cells in culture transiently activates p38 and JNK, whereas inhibition of p38 activity alone suppresses nerve growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis. It is also clear from various studies that MAP kinase activation is cell type- and/or stimulus-specific. It is therefore important to define, for a given cell type, the specific pathway(s) that links external stimuli to the target genes that promote changes in cell phenotype. The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel, ENaC, is localized to the apical surface of salt transporting epithelia, notably the collecting duct of the kidney, salivary glands, colon, and respiratory tract. In the lung, ENaC activity is essential in controlling the amount of liquid within the air space. Both pharmacological and genetic studies have shown that at birth ENaC function is critical for clearing lung fluid (15.O'Brodovich H. Hannam V. Seear M. Mullen J.B. J. Appl. Physiol. 1990; 68: 1758-1762Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 16.Hummler E. Barker P. Gatzy J. Beermann F. Verdumo C. Schmidt A. Boucher R. Rossier B.C. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 325-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). However, there are certain conditions where pulmonary fluid clearance appears impaired. For example, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by the presence of refractory hypoxemia, reduced lung compliance, increased permeability pulmonary edema, and diffuse alveolar infiltration on chest radiographs. Pathologically, ARDS develops as a result of alveolar-capillary membrane disruption with leakage of protein-rich exudate and migration of inflammatory cells (neutrophils and macrophages) into the air space (17.Spragg R.G. Smith R.M. Crystal R.G. West J.B. The Lung: Scientific Foundations. Raven, New York1991: 2003-2017Google Scholar). Neutrophils within the pulmonary circulation are activated, causing the release of free radicals and reactive oxygen species, which are increasingly regarded as the key mediators of pulmonary tissue damage (18.Chabot F. Mitchell J.A. Gutteridge J.M. Evans T.W. Eur. Respir. J. 1998; 11: 745-757PubMed Google Scholar). The specific effect(s) elicited by reactive oxygen and/or nitrogen species on lung epithelial cells during injury is currently under intense investigation. Recently, it has been demonstrated that nitric oxide inhibits ENaC activity in distal lung epithelial cells (19.Ding J.W. Dickie J. O'Brodovich H. Shintani Y. Rafii B. Hackam D. Marunaka Y. Rotstein O.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: L378-L387PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, to date, the molecular mechanism underlying oxidative stress-induced ENaC inhibition in lung epithelia is unclear. Because ENaC activity is dependent upon its Œ±-subunit expression (see Ref. 20.Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar for a review), we decided to use exogenous H2O2 treatment in A549 cells as an experimental paradigm to investigate whether or not oxidative stress represses the sodium channel Œ±-subunit gene, Œ±-ENaC, expression. Previously, our laboratory has utilized salivary epithelial cells as a model system to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for dexamethasone (Dex)-dependent and Ras-repressible Œ±-ENaC expression (21.Lin H.H.

We reported that Ras activation leads to the stimulation of the ERK effector pathway and consequently to the inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor (GR)/Dex-stimulated Œ±-ENaC transcription in parotid epithelial cells. A bona fide glucocorticoid response element (GRE) has been identified by us within the ‚àí1334 to ‚àí1306 bp of rat Œ±-ENaC promoter/enhancer region and has been shown to be critical for glucocorticoid induction in salivary epithelial cells (21.Lin H.H.

This Dex-dependent regulatory motif is also conserved in the human Œ±-ENaC 5‚Ä≤-flanking region (23.Sayegh R. Auerbach S.D. Li X. Loftus R.W. Husted R.F. Stokes J.B. Thomas C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12431-12437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, whether or not the cross-talk between Ras- and GR-mediated pathways, governing overall transcriptional regulation of theŒ±-ENaC gene, also exists in nonsalivary cells, such as lung epithelial cells, has yet to be demonstrated. In addition, elucidating the specific pathways involved in the mediation ofŒ±-ENaC gene repression by oxidative stress may lead to the development of strategies that prevent and/or treat acute lung or oxidative injury in general. The present study was undertaken to unravel the role of oxidative stress- and Ras-mediated signaling pathways in modulating GRE-dependent Œ±-ENaC expression in lung epithelial cells. Data reported herein demonstrate for the first time that both exogenous H2O2-mediated oxidative stress and Ras activation suppress Dex-dependentŒ±-ENaC transcriptional activation in lung A549 cells. This antagonistic cross-talk between H2O2-/Ras-mediated pathways and the glucocorticoid hormone pathway occurs via the previously identifiedŒ±-ENaC GRE in its homologous promoter or a heterologous promoter context via overlapping as well as nonoverlapping mechanisms. We further establish that ERK, but not MEKK1/JNK, is the major MAP kinase-signaling pathway utilized by exogenous H2O2 to repress Dex-mediatedŒ±-ENaC induction. Moreover, we also report that an anti-oxidant system, thioredoxin (TRX), is involved in regulating GR/Dex-dependent Œ±-ENaC transcription. Together, these data suggest that both ERK-dependent and TRX-sensitive pathways play a critical role in allowing exogenous and endogenous oxidative stress to attenuate the GR/Dex effect onŒ±-ENaC expression in lung epithelial cells and possibly in other tight epithelia. Dex and H2O2 were obtained from Sigma. Dex was resuspended to 1 mm in ethanol and stored at ‚àí80 ¬∞C. U0126 (Promega), prepared as a 1 mmstock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at ‚àí20 ¬∞C. The human lung carcinoma A549 cells (24.Lieber M. Smith B. Szakal A. Nelson-Rees W. Todaro G. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection. These cells were maintained in Ham's F12 (Kaighn's modification, pH 7.4, Sigma) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 Œºg/ml streptomycin. Reporter constructs ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc and GREmt-1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc were engineered from Œ±-ENaC/CATs (wt) and its GRE mutant (GREmt) (21.Lin H.H. Zentner M.D. Ho H.-L.L. Kim K.-J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), respectively. Individual 1.3-kilobaseSacI/XbaI (vector)-DNA fragments (‚àí1413 to ‚àí154 bp) were excised from wt and GREmt Œ±-ENaC/CATsand ligated into SacI/NheI-digested promoterless pGL2-Basic reporter plasmid to generate ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc and GREmt-1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc, respectively. A reporter construct, p(‚àí1334/‚àí1306)GL2-P, containing one copy of Œ±-ENaC GRE was generated as described previously (21.Lin H.H. Zentner M.D. Ho H.-L.L. Kim K.-J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In brief, a pair of complementary and 5‚Ä≤-phosphorylated oligomers, which correspond to ‚àí1334 to ‚àí1306 bp of Œ±-ENaC, were annealed by incubating 200 pmol of each oligomer in a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6) and 10 mm MgCl2 followed by heating to 85 ¬∞C for 2 min and stepwise cooling at 65 ¬∞C (15 min), 37 ¬∞C (15 min), 25 ¬∞C (15 min), and 4 ¬∞C (15 min). These annealed oligos, which have a built-in 5‚Ä≤-phosphorylatedXhoI overhang, were ligated to XhoI-linearized pGL2-Promoter plasmid DNA (Promega). The pcDNA-TRX expression construct was engineered by inserting an EcoRI-digested MT78 insert into the EcoRI cloning site of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). MT78 was cloned from a full-length (550 bp) monkey TRX cDNA (25.An G. Wu R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The sequence of all plasmid constructs was confirmed by DNA sequence analyses. A constitutive Ras V12 expression construct was a generous gift from Dr. D. Johnson (University of Southern California), whereas MEKK1, JNK, Œ≤-actin/Luc and ‚àí73Collagenase/Luc expression constructs were kindly provided by Dr. E. Zendi (University of Southern California). Plasmid DNAs were transiently transfected into A549 or TRXs A549 cells (see below) using SuperFectTM (Quiagen) per the manufacturer's instructions. In all experiments, 0.1 Œºg of Renilla luciferase plasmid, pRL-TK (Promega), was included as an indicator plasmid to normalize for transfection efficiency. The total amount of DNA in each transfection of cells grown in a 35-mm dish was kept constant at 2 Œºg by supplementing with pCMV vector. Cells were serum-deprived for 8 h by replacing growth medium with a medium containing 0.05% stripped serum at 24 h after the start of transfection. For H2O2 treatment, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed with 3 ml of prewarmed phosphate-buffered Kreb's Ringer solution, which contains 1.0 mm MgSO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 144 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 8.5 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, prior to incubating cells with various concentrations of H2O2 in phosphate-buffered Kreb's Ringer solution for 20 min. These cells were washed once with regular culture medium and incubated with a medium containing 0.05% stripped serum followed by cell harvesting 16 h thereafter. The firefly- and Renilla-luciferase activities were measured using the Dual LuciferaseTM Reporter Assay Kit (Promega) following the manufacturer's instruction. All transient transfection assays were carried out in duplicate at least three times using two separate preparations of plasmid DNA. The stably transfected TRX-overexpressing A549 cells were established by transfecting A549 cells with pcDNA-TRX expression construct using the DEAE-dextran-mediated method (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. After selection with Geneticin (G418, 1200 Œºg/ml), ten resistant clones were isolated, expanded, and screened for their TRX expression level by Western blot analyses. Among 10 clones, clone 2 exhibited the highest TRX expression level and was used in this study; it is hereafter referred to as TRXs-A549. Total RNA was isolated from A549 cells using TRIzol¬Æ Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as instructed by the manufacturer. The quality and quantity of RNA were determined by both spectrophotometric analysis and fractionation of RNA on a 1.3% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 m formaldehyde followed by staining with ethidium bromide to compare the ratio of 28 S to 18 S ribosomal RNAs. For Northern blot analyses, equal amounts of RNA (18 Œºg each) were loaded onto an agarose/formaldehyde gel, fractionated by size, transferred to a 0.2-Œºm nylon membrane (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.), and UV cross-linked. All blots were prehybridized for 1 h in QuickHyb¬Æ (Stratagene¬Æ). The hybridization was carried out according to the manufacturer's instruction. 32P-labeledŒ±-ENaC probes were prepared from an isolated ratŒ±-ENaC cDNA fragment (bases 1‚Äì905) using a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). After hybridization, blots were washed three times at 60 ¬∞C for 2 h each in a 0.1√ó SSC (0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate) solution containing 0.5% SDS. All blots were reprobed with a humanŒ≤-actin probe to ensure that the quality and quantity of RNA among different samples were comparable. The radioactive signal was visualized by autoradiography where blots were exposed to BioMaxTMMS films at ‚àí80 ¬∞C overnight, using BioMaxTM TranScreen-HE (Eastman Kodak Company) to improve sensitivity. Blots were also quantitated through the use of electronic autoradiography with an Instantimager 228 (Packard Instrument Co). The amount of Œ±-ENaC message was quantitatively compared between lanes after normalizing against the correspondingŒ≤-actin level. Equal amounts of soluble proteins from A549 or TRXsA549 whole cell lysates were subjected to a 10 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto ImmobilonTM-P membrane (Millipore) and incubated with the respective primary antibody including anti-ERK1 (C-16-G, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-ActiveTMmitogen-activated protein kinase (Promega), anti-phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (New England BioLabs), anti-phospho-p38 MAPK (New England BioLabs) or anti-TRX. The polyclonal anti-TRX antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic N-terminal 19-mer peptide (K3QIESKAAFQEALDDAGDK21) from monkey TRX (25.An G. Wu R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 170-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to detect the bound primary antibody. Immune complexes were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the manufacturer's instruction. The glucocorticoid hormone, Dex, has been demonstrated to increase fetal and postnatal lung Œ±-ENaC mRNA levels in rat (26.Tchepichev S. Ueda J. Canessa C. Rossier B.C. O'Brodovich H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C805-C812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Dex treatment enhances short circuit current, an index for active Na+ absorption, across primary cultured rat alveolar epithelial cell monolayers. 2K. J. Kim, unpublished observation. To determine whether or not glucocorticoids increaseŒ±-ENaC expression in A549 cells and could therefore be used as a model to explore the molecular mechanism by which glucocorticoids modulate ENaC activity in lung epithelial cells, Northern blot analyses were performed on total RNA taken from A549 cells treated with 100 nm Dex for either 4 or 24 h (Fig. 1). A single band corresponding to the reported size of the Œ±-ENaC message (‚àº3700 bases) (27.Canessa C.M. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar) was detected. Dex treatment induced the expression ofŒ±-ENaC within 4 h, suggesting that Dex-enhancedŒ±-ENaC expression, in part, accounts for the increase in amiloride-sensitive Na+ transport. This suggests that glucocorticoid hormone may not only induce Œ±-ENaCexpression during lung development but may also modulateŒ±-ENaC expression in adult human lung epithelial cells as well (26.Tchepichev S. Ueda J. Canessa C. Rossier B.C. O'Brodovich H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C805-C812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether glucocorticoids up-regulate Œ±-ENaC at the transcriptional level in A549 cells, we subcloned the 1.3-kilobase DNA 5‚Ä≤-flanking region, ‚àí1413 to ‚àí154 bp (relative to the translation initiator ATG (21.Lin H.H. Zentner M.D. Ho H.-L.L. Kim K.-J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar)), of rat Œ±-ENaC into a promoterless reporter plasmid, pGL2-basic, to create ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc (Fig.2 A). These constructs were used based on our previous observation that the GRE located between nucleotide ‚àí1334 to ‚àí1306 of the rat Œ±-ENaC 5‚Ä≤-flanking region plays an essential role in dictating the overallŒ±-ENaC expression level in salivary cells (21.Lin H.H.

To ascertain the contribution from the identified Œ±-ENaC GRE in modulating ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc activity in A549 cells, we mutated the GRE within the context of the full-length Œ±-ENaC/reporter to create GREmt‚Äì1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc (Fig. 2 A). The wild type ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc and GREmt‚Äì1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc reporter constructs were transiently transfected in A549 cells and the associated luciferase activities were assayed. As shown in Fig.2 B, 100 nm Dex treatment alone was able to stimulate luciferase activities of the wild type ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc by 10-fold (lane 1 versus 2), suggesting that A549 cells harbor an endogenously functional GR that up-regulatesŒ±-ENaC expression at the transcriptional level. Point mutations within the Œ±-ENaC GRE abolished the enhancement observed in the presence of Dex (Fig. 2 B, lane 6 versus 5), confirming that the GRE, located between ‚àí1334 and ‚àí1306 bp of Œ±-ENaC 5‚Ä≤-flanking region, is critical for the Dex-stimulated Œ±-ENaC gene expression in A549 cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the previously identified GRE is the major transcription enhancer for modulatingŒ±-ENaC expression by glucocorticoid hormone in human lung epithelial cells. To ascertain that the cross-talk between Ras- and GR/Dex-mediated signaling pathways that we recently reported for salivary epithelial Pa-4 cells (21.Lin H.H. Zentner M.D. Ho H.-L.L. Kim K.-J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22.Zentner M.D. Lin H.H. Wen X. Kim K.J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30770-30776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) also dictate overallŒ±-ENaC expression levels in nonsalivary cells, we assessed the effect of Ras on Œ±-ENaC promoter/enhancer activity using transient transfection and reporter assays in lung A549 cells. As illustrated in Fig. 2 B, the constituitively active Ras V12 markedly repressed ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc activity when cotransfected into Dex-treated A549 cells (lane 2 versus 4). However, Ras V12 alone elicited a modest inhibitory effect on the transfected reporter activities (lane 3 versus 1). Although the point mutations within the identified GRE did not reduce the basal reporter expression (Fig. 2 B,lane 5 versus 1), they substantially abrogated Dex-mediated induction (Fig. 2 B, lane 6 versus 2). The Ras-mediated suppression of Dex-enhanced ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc reporter activities (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 4) was also abolished by the Œ±-ENaCGRE mutation in A549 cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes 6 and8). This repression is reminiscent of our previous identification of Ras activation as a negative mediator of Dex-stimulated Œ±-ENaC gene transcription in salivary cells (21.Lin H.H. Zentner M.D. Ho H.-L.L. Kim K.-J. Ann D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21544-21554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which appears to be also retained in lung epithelial cells (Fig.2 B). We next examined the effect on Œ±-ENaCexpression of exogenous H2O2, an agent that has been reported to interfere with sodium homeostasis in the alveolar epithelium (28.Kim K.J. Suh D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L308-L315PubMed Google Scholar) and implicated in acute lung injury (28.Kim K.J. Suh D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L308-L315PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of exogenous H2O2, up to 1 mm, to culture medium of A549 cells did not cause obvious cytotoxicity; nor did it appear to a have an adverse effect on transcription in general,Œ≤-actin (Fig. 2 C, lane 17 versus lanes 18‚Äì21) or p65 expression (data not shown). H2O2 evoked no repression of the unstimulated ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc activity (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1‚Äì5), whereas the Dex-stimulated luciferase activity from the -1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc reporter was considerably lower in 100 Œºm H2O2-treated cells than that of control A549 cells (Fig. 2 C, lane 7 versus 6). H2O2 inhibited the Dex-stimulated ‚àí1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc activity with an apparent IC50 of approximately 100 Œºm (Fig.2 C, lanes 6‚Äì10). The residual reporter activity from GREmt‚Äì1.4Œ±-ENaC/Luc was not affected by exogenous H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2 C, lanes 12‚Äì16), reinforcing that Œ±-ENaC repression was not a result of nonspecific cell damage by H2O2treatment. Given that the mutation of the Œ±-ENaC GRE abolished H2O2-mediated repression (Fig.2 C, lanes 12‚Äì16) and that exogenous H2O2 had no inhibitory effect on basal activity (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1‚Äì5), we conclude that exogenous H2O2 preferentially suppresses stimulatedŒ±-ENaC expression via the identified Œ±-ENaCGRE. Together, these data indicate that the presence of an intact GRE in the Œ±-ENaC 5‚Ä≤-flanking region is necessary for both treatment with exogenous H2O2 and Ras activation to evoke their inhibitory effect on Œ±-ENaCexpression in lung epithelial cells. Based on our data in Fig. 2 C, we hypothesized that oxidative stress by H2O2 attenuatesŒ±-ENaC expression via repressing the GR/Dex effect on the activity of the identified Œ±-ENaC GRE. To further test this hypothesis, we transiently transfected A549 cells with a reporter construct harboring the identified Œ±-ENaC GRE coupled to a SV40 minimal promoter-driven luciferase reporter, p(‚àí1334/‚àí1306)GL2-P (Fig. 2 D). After transfection, these cells were maintained in the absence or presence of various concentrations of H2O2 for 20 min and then incubated with 100 nm Dex for 16 h prior to harvesting. This reporter system provides a sensitive and direct measurement of the effect of exogenous H2O2 on Œ±-ENaC GRE function. As shown in Fig. 2 D, treatment with 100 nm Dex, in the absence of exogenous H2O2, enhanced the reporter activity in transfected A549 cells by greater than 20-fold (lane 6 versus 1). This Dex-mediated enhancement was consistent with, but higher than, that observed in ‚àí"

Human SP-B is the 79-amino acid product of extensive post-translational processing of a 381-amino acid preproprotein. Processing involves modification of the primary translation product from 39 to 42 kDa and at least 3 subsequent proteolytic cleavages to produce the mature 8-kDa SP-B. To examine the intracellular sites of SP-B processing, we carried out immunofluorescence cytochemistry and inhibitor studies on human fetal lung in explant culture and isolated type 2 cells in monolayer culture using polyclonal antibodies to human SP-B8(Phe201-Met279) and specific epitopes within the N- (NFProx, Ser145-Leu160; NFlank Gln186-Gln200) and C-terminal (CFlank, Gly284-Ser304) propeptides of pro-SP-B. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry using epitope-specific antisera showed colocalization of pro-SP-B with the endoplasmic reticulum resident protein BiP. The 25-kDa intermediate was partially endo H-sensitive, colocalized with the medial Golgi resident protein MG160, and shifted into the endoplasmic reticulum in the presence of brefeldin A, which interferes with anterograde transport from endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi. The 9-kDa intermediate colocalized in part with MG160 but not with Lamp-1, a transmembrane protein resident in late endosomes and lamellar bodies. Brefeldin A induced a loss of colocalization between MG160 and NFlank, shifting NFlank immunostaining to a juxtanuclear tubular array. In pulse-chase studies, brefeldin A blocked all processing of 42-kDa pro-SP-B whereas similar studies using monensin blocked the final N-terminal processing event of 9 to 8 kDa SP-B. We conclude that: 1) the first enzymatic cleavage of pro-SP-B to the 25-kDa intermediate is in the brefeldin A-sensitive, medial Golgi; 2) cleavage of the 25-kDa intermediate to a 9-kDa form is a trans-Golgi event that is slowed but not blocked by monensin; 3) the final cleavage of 9 to 8 kDa SP-B is a monensin-sensitive, post-Golgi event occurring prior to transfer of SP-B to lamellar bodies.

The 21-kDa pro-SP-C undergoes sequential enzymatic cleavages resulting in a 3.7-kDa mature protein. Pro-SP-C is detected in endoplasmic reticulum and a 6-kDa intermediate is enriched in lamellar bodies. Inhibitors of intracellular trafficking and acidification in vitro disrupt all processing beyond the 16-kDa SP-C intermediate. Processing of SP-B and SP-C are linked, since in alveolar type 2 cells of patients with inherited SP-B deficiency SP-C is not processed beyond the 6-kDa intermediate (14.Beers M. Hamvas A. Moxley M.

In this report, we use epitope-specific antisera and pulse-chase labeling studies with inhibitors of protein processing to show that most human pro-SP-B processing is in post-endoplasmic reticulum but pre-lamellar body compartments. Our data extend previous observations of pro-SP-B trafficking and processing to show that early N-terminal propeptide and C-terminal propeptide processing events occur within the Golgi apparatus with processing of the small vestigial N-terminal propeptide domain as a post-Golgi event. We speculate that the N-terminal remnant is involved in trafficking SP-B toward the lamellar body. Previous reports of these data have appeared elsewhere in abstract form (16.Korimilli A. Beers M.F. Ballard P.L. Guttentag S.H. Pediatr. Res. 1999; 45: 55ACrossref Google Scholar, 17.Guttentag S. Korimilli A.D. Xing B. Beers M.F. Ballard P.L. Pediatr. Res. 1998; 43: 49ACrossref Google Scholar). Express Protein Labeling Mix was obtained from NEN Life Science Products Inc. (Boston, MA). Protein A-agarose was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Dexamethasone, isobutylmethylxanthine, and 8-Br-cAMP were obtained from Sigma. Endoglycosidase H (endo H) and PNGase F were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All other reagents were electrophoretic grade and were purchased from either Bio-Rad or Novex (San Diego, CA). Culture media were produced by the Cell Center Facility, University of Pennsylvania. The polyclonal antibody to BiP was supplied by StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). The MG160 polyclonal antiserum was the generous gift of N. Gonatas, Division of Neuropathology, University of Pennsylvania. The Lamp-1 (H4A3) monoclonal antibody developed by J. T. August and J. E. K. Hildreth was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the NICHD, National Institutes of Health, and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biological Sciences, Iowa City, IA. Human fetal lung was obtained from second trimester therapeutic abortions (20‚Äì23-week estimated gestational age) under protocols approved by the Committee for Human Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Fetal lung parenchyma was dissected free of large airways, chopped into 1-mm3explants, and cultured in Waymouth's media on a rocking platform as described previously (18.Gonzales L.W. Ballard P.L. Ertsey R. Williams M.C. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1986; 62: 678-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). After overnight culture, hormones (10 nm dexamethasone, 0.1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, and 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (DCI)) were added to the media for the remainder of the culture period. Media were changed daily and tissues were studied on day 5 of culture. Type 2 cells were isolated from human fetal lung explants after 4 days in culture with DCI using collagenase-trypsin digestion and differential adhesion to remove fibroblasts and plated on coverslips coated with extracellular matrix of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (19.Alcorn J.L.

Feinstein S.I. Solarin K.O. Beers M.F. Ballard P.L. Pediatr. Res. 1999; 45: 52AGoogle Scholar). Fibroblast contamination of the final culture varied between 5 and 10% of cells. Cells were cultured in Waymouth's media supplemented with DCI in 35-mm dishes for up to 4 days. Under these conditions, type 2 alveolar cells maintain expression of SP-A, -B, and -C mRNA, process SP-B and -C proproteins and incorporate choline into surfactant phospholipids for at least 4 days in culture (20.Gonzales L.W. Angampalli S. Matlapudi A. Feinstein S.I. Solarin K.O. Beers M.F. Ballard P.L. Pediatr. Res. 1999; 45: 52AGoogle Scholar). Based on the antigenicity index of prepro-SP-B, peptide sequences were chosen for production of synthetic peptides and antiserum preparation (NFProx, Ser145-Leu160, NFlank, Gln186-Gln200, and CFlank, Gly284-Ser304) as described previously (8.Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Bieler B.M. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L559-L566PubMed Google Scholar) and illustrated in Fig. 1. Human SP-B antiserum was prepared using purified human SP-B8 isolated from patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis as described previously for anti-bovine SP-B antibody (21.Beers M. Bates S. Fisher A. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: L773-L778PubMed Google Scholar). Antisera were screened for reactivity against the immunizing peptide by immunodot blot assay. The IgG fractions of NFlank, CFlank, NFProx, and hSP-B antisera were isolated using the Serum IgG Purification Kit (Bio-Rad) and conjugated to FITC using Fluoreporter Protein labeling Kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). For single labeling studies, cells were cultured overnight before immunofluorescent labeling. In double labeling studies, isolated type 2 cells were harvested on culture day 4 with no further treatment (control) or after treatment with brefeldin A (10 Œºg/ml) for 30 min. Cells were washed free of media in PBS and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by washes in PBS with 5 mm NH4Cl. Coverslips were incubated in freshly prepared 0.1% sodium borohydride to reduce autofluorescence followed by 5% bovine serum albumin, 10% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) in PBS for 30 min at room temperature to reduce nonspecific binding. The cells were permeabilized using 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS. Specific antisera were diluted in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 + 5% bovine serum albumin and 10% normal goat serum. The unlabeled primary antibody was applied as follows: polyclonal MG160, 1:500, overnight at room temperature; BiP, 1:1500 overnight at 4 ¬∞C; Lamp-1, 1:100, overnight at room temperature. After washing in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100, Cy-3-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) was diluted at 1:300 in the blocking solution described above and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After additional washes in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100, FITC-conjugated SP-B antisera were applied at 1:100 dilution and incubated overnight at room temperature. Coverslips were washed in PBS + 0.3% Triton X-100, air dried, and mounted using Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) to reduce fading. All immunostaining experiments were done in triplicate. Confocal microscopic images were obtained using a computer-interfaced, laser-scanning microscope (Leica TCS 4D), of the Confocal Core Facility, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Immunolabeled slides (n = 3‚Äì4 representative fields per slide), were sectioned optically at 0.5-Œºm intervals through the cell monolayer to obtain the appropriate focal depth. The representative 0.5-Œºm image chosen contained nucleus and the relevent organelle of interest (ER, Golgi, and/or lamellar body). Simultaneous wavelength scanning allowed superimposition of fluorescent labeling with FITC and Cy3 fluorophores. Laser power was fixed at 75% for all image acquisition. Image output was at 1024 √ó 1024 pixels and photomicrographs were later embossed with a 20-Œºm bar unless otherwise indicated. Culture media was replaced with Met-Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (2 ml/60-mm plate) with or without inhibitors for 2 h while incubating in 95% air, 5% CO2 on a rocking platform. The inhibitors brefeldin A (10 Œºg/ml) or monensin (2 Œºm) were added at the beginning of the starvation period and maintained throughout the pulse and chase periods. Met-Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium ¬± inhibitors was then replaced with Met-Cys-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium ¬± inhibitors supplemented with 200 ŒºCi/ml 35S-Express Protein Labeling Mix (2 ml/60-mm plate) which is composed of 70% methionine and 15% cysteine (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). After a 1-h pulse, the media was changed to complete Waymouth's media with DCI ¬± inhibitors. To ensure that inhibitor concentrations remained constant, media was changed at each subsequent time point through the 8-h time point of the 24-h chase. Samples were harvested immediately after the35S labeling and at regular intervals through 8 h post-labeling. Samples were washed in PBS with protease inhibitors (10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mmbenzamidine HCl, and 80 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then sonicated in 500 Œºl of 1% SDS with protease inhibitors. Radiolabeled lung homogenates were immunoprecipitated by modification of our previous method (8.Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Bieler B.M. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L559-L566PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were performed on samples containing 106 trichloroacetic acid precipitable counts/min unless otherwise specified, using 3 Œºl of anti-human SP-B antibody (hSP-B) or preimmune rabbit serum. After the first immunoprecipitation, protein A-agarose beads were washed and the immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized in 40 Œºl of gel sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.72 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.0075% bromphenol blue). A 5-Œºl aliquot was taken for scintillation counting and a 30-Œºl aliquot was subjected to SDS-PAGE in 16.5% polyacrylamide gels using a Tris-Tricine buffer system as described previously (8.Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Bieler B.M. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L559-L566PubMed Google Scholar). Electrophoresed samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) at 20 mA/cm2 for 13‚Äì16 h. After transfer to membranes, blots were visualized using the Storm PhosphorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), analyzed using Imagequant software and later subjected to autoradiography. After immunoprecipitation from hormone-treated human fetal lung pulse-chase labeled for 4 h, triplicate samples still complexed to protein A-agarose beads were treated with either endo H or PNGase F. Control samples were incubated in wash buffer. Endo H-treated samples were resuspended in 1 √ó G5 buffer with 2000 units of endo H while PNGase F-treated samples were resuspended in 1 √ó G7 buffer, 1% Nonidet P-40 with 4000 units of PNGase F. All samples were incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 2 h followed by a final wash before solubilizing the beads in NuPAGE SDS sample buffer with DTT as the reducing agent. For superior band resolution, these samples were separated using a 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel with MES SDS Running Buffer as per the manufacturer's protocol (Novex, San Diego, CA), including transfer to Duralose membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for PhosphorImager analysis. To localize SP-B precursor and intermediate forms within type 2 cells of human fetal lung, we used epitope-specific antisera developed against antigenic sequences within the N- and C-terminal propeptides. Fluorescence cytochemistry of type 2 cells isolated from cultured, hormone-treated human fetal lung showed distinct immunostaining patterns for each of the antisera (Fig.2). The NFProx antiserum immunostaining occupied a perinuclear pattern. The CFlank antiserum exhibited a vesicular pattern of fluorescence throughout the cell. The NFlank antiserum also showed a vesicular pattern but in close approximation to lamellar bodies which have a perinuclear distribution by phase-contrast microscopy. By comparison, the antiserum to mature SP-B (hSP-B) intensely labeled lamellar bodies and no other structures presumably due to the high concentration of SP-B8 within lamellar bodies. The specificity of each antiserum was confirmed by the ability of synthetic peptide to block the signal in immunohistochemistry (data not shown). Double immunofluorescence labeling was used to identify the subcellular location of staining with the epitope-specific antisera using known markers of subcellular organelles in type 2 cells. Contaminating fibroblasts were occasionally present but were recognizable by absence of staining with the FITC-labeled epitope-specific antisera despite positive staining for subcellular organelles. Confocal images were obtained using the following laser parameters for FITC-labeled primary SP-B antisera: NFProx voltage mean 808 (range 781‚Äì840), offset ‚àí15 to ‚àí17; CFlank voltage mean 844 (range 812‚Äì877), offset ‚àí7 to ‚àí26; NFlank voltage mean 775 (range 754‚Äì789), offset ‚àí19 to ‚àí24; hSP-B voltage mean 726 (range 705‚Äì740), offset ‚àí16 to ‚àí19. By comparison, the parameters for Cy3-labeled secondary IgG were voltage mean 807 (range 691‚Äì891), offset ‚àí4 to ‚àí22. Pinhole settings, which were identical for both FITC and Cy3 images due to simultaneous scanning, were: NFProx/Cy3 mean 169 (range 157‚Äì181), CFlank/Cy3 mean 179 (range 146‚Äì207), NFlank/Cy3 mean 173 (range 141‚Äì191), hSP-B/Cy3 mean 163 (range 129‚Äì194). Overall, the hSP-B antiserum yielded more intense staining as reflected by the lower voltage and pinhole settings required for optimal image acquisition. Conversely, the epitope-specific antisera required higher acquisition settings to achieve equivalent image quality. Fig. 3 illustrates the results of double immunofluorescence cytochemistry of isolated type 2 cells using monoclonal antibody to BiP (as a marker of endoplasmic reticulum and identified by Cy3-labeled secondary antibody) and SP-B epitope-specific antisera directly conjugated to FITC. Colocalization of NFProx immunostaining with BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum was evident in both merged (yellow; Fig. 3 a) and unmerged images (Fig. 3 b). There was minor colocalization of CFlank and NFlank antisera with BiP, whereas the steady-state pool of pro-SP-B in the endoplasmic reticulum was preferentially identified by NFProx. There was minimal colocalization of BiP with hSP-B antiserum. Fig. 4 illustrates double immunofluorescence photomicrographs of isolated type 2 cells using polyclonal antibody to MG160, identified by Cy3-labeled secondary antibody, and FITC-conjugated epitope-specific antisera. MG160 is a medial Golgi resident transmembrane sialoglycoprotein which is found as a component of the Golgi apparatus of most cells (22.Gonatas J.O. Mourelatos Z. Stieber A. Lane W.S. Brosius J. Gonatas N.K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 457-467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Stieber A. Mourelatos Z. Chen Y.J. Le Douarin N. Gonatas N.K. Exp. Cell. Res. 1995; 219: 562-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By confocal fluorescence microscopy, NFProx did not colocalize with MG160. CFlank and NFlank immunostaining colocalized intensely with MG160 in a tubular network lying in close proximity to the nucleus which is characteristic of the medial Golgi. Although this region was also close to lamellar bodies, there was no colocalization of hSP-B with MG160. Fig. 5 shows double immunofluorescence images of isolated type 2 cells labeled using Lamp-1 monoclonal antibody, identified by Cy3-labeled secondary antibody, and FITC-conjugated epitope-specific antisera. Lamp-1 is a transmembrane protein which localizes to late endosomes, lysosomes and, in alveolar type 2 cells, lamellar bodies (24.Wasano K. Hirakawa Y. Histochemistry. 1994; 102: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Neither NFProx nor CFlank antisera colocalized with Lamp-1. NFlank immunostaining highlighted vesicles adjacent to lamellar bodies (as seen in Fig. 2) which were Lamp-1-negative. By contrast, the hSP-B antiserum localized to dense regions within Lamp-1-positive lamellar bodies (Fig. 5,inset). Taken together, these immunofluorescence data suggest that at steady state pro-SP-B is endoplasmic reticulum resident and the 25-kDa intermediate, which is identified by both CFlank and NFlank, is distributed within the Golgi. In contrast, mature SP-B is concentrated within the lamellar body. To examine ER to Golgi transport of SP-B precursors, we carried out pulse-chase labeling of cultured human fetal lung in the presence or absence of brefeldin A, an inhibitor of anterograde trafficking between endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (25.Chardin P. McCormick F. Cell. 1999; 97: 153-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). We showed previously that processing from pro-SP-B through 25- and 9-kDa intermediates to mature 8-kDa SP-B occurs within 1‚Äì2 h postlabeling in hormone-treated human fetal lung explants (8.Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Bieler B.M. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L559-L566PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.6). In the presence of brefeldin A, processing of pro-SP-B was blocked with no accumulation of 25 kDa or more distal intermediates over 8 h of chase (Fig. 6). This suggests that the initial N-terminal cleavage of pro-SP-B occurs in a brefeldin A-sensitive cis or medial Golgi compartment. We also performed endoglycosidase digestions of SP-B intermediates isolated by immunoprecipitation after a 4-h pulse-chase. The 9- and 8-kDa SP-B proteins are not glycosylated and do not shift apparentM r after treatment with either PNGase F or endo H (Fig. 7). PNGase F, which cleaves all carbohydrates, reduces the 42-kDa pro-SP-B to ‚àº39 kDa and the 25-kDa intermediate to ‚àº21 kDa. After endo H treatment, both pro-SP-B and the 25-kDa intermediate appear to be partially endo H-sensitive (39- and 21-kDa bands, respectively) and endo H-resistant (42- and 25-kDa bands, respectively). The majority of pro-SP-B is endo H-sensitive but a small fraction are endo H-resistant. Conversely, a small amount of the 25-kDa intermediate is endo H-sensitive and the bulk of this intermediate is endo H-resistant. Together with the brefeldin A studies, these data place the initial N-terminal cleavage of pro-SP-B to 25-kDa intermediate in the medial Golgi. To discriminate the location of the first N-terminal cleavage from the subsequent cleavage of the C terminus, we examined the steady state distribution of SP-B intermediates in the presence of brefeldin A using double immunofluorescence staining of isolated type 2 cells. In Fig.8, brefeldin A-treated cells were fixed and double stained using antibodies to BiP (Fig. 8 A) or MG160 (Fig. 8 B) in combination with the FITC-conjugated epitope-specific antisera. Control cells (not shown) mimicked the immunostaining patterns illustrated in Fig. 4. BiP, NFProx, and hSP-B immunostaining patterns were unaffected by brefeldin A treatment. CFlank immunostaining dispersed after exposure to brefeldin A, as did the distribution of MG160, with both antisera now colocalizing with BiP. CFlank immunostaining identifies a pool of SP-B intermediate within a brefeldin A-sensitive, cis/medial Golgi compartment similar to MG160. By contrast, NFlank identified an intermediate that at steady state was predominantly distal to the brefeldin A-sensitive Golgi regions with the majority of NFlank immunostaining collapsing into perinuclear tubular arrays characteristic of trans-Golgi proteins exposed to brefeldin. To localize late processing events, we carried out pulse-chase labeling of lung explants in the presence and absence of monensin. Monensin, an ionophore mediating monovalent cation exchange across cellular membranes, reversibly slows the rate of intracellular transport of newly synthesized proteins, especially interfering with transfer across Golgi compartments and compromising secretion from the trans-Golgi (26.Tartakoff A.M. Cell. 1983; 32: 1026-1028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Although pro-SP-B processing was slowed, monensin treatment did not prevent the appearance of 25- and 9-kDa SP-B intermediates (Fig. 9). However, processing to 8-kDa mature SP-B was not demonstrated up to 8 h after labeling, suggesting that the final N-terminal cleavage of te 9-kDa intermediate is a pH-dependent, post-Golgi event. Combined with the observation that NFlank immunostaining is not found within lamellar bodies, this places the terminal cleavage event in a post-Golgi but pre-lamellar body compartment. The processing of pro-SP-B to mature SP-B in alveolar type 2 cells requires a series of post-translational modifications and proteolytic cleavages. Through the course of SP-B processing, the mature protein must be transported to the lamellar body where it is concentrated with SP-C and surfactant-specific phospholipids. The mechanisms controlling the process of lamellar body formation and the aggregation of these diverse surfactant components are poorly understood. To elucidate these events, it became important to examine the intracellular localization of SP-B processing. Previous studies by others using immunoelectron microscopy localized the primary translation product, pro-SP-B, to the endoplasmic reticulum with mature SP-B concentrated in lamellar bodies. The present study extends these observations with new data demonstrating that the initial proteolytic cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide is in the brefeldin A-sensitive, medial Golgi with a subsequent C-terminal cleavage in the trans-Golgi and a final N-terminal cleavage event in a post-Golgi but pre-lamellar body compartment as depicted in Fig. 10. We used type 2 cells isolated from hormone-treated human fetal lung explants for immunofluorescence studies. Recent advances in type 2 cell culture allow maintenance of type 2 cell phenotype for extended periods (19.Alcorn J.L. Smith M.E. Smith J.F. Margraf L.R. Mendelson C.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

When 6-DMAP is added to metaphase-arrested Xenopus egg extracts, chromosomal DNA replication is blocked, very likely at the initiation step (1.Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 16.Mahbubani H.M. Chong J.P. Chevalier S. Thommes P. Blow J.J. J.

Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), indicating that 6-DMAP may affect the function of MCM proteins. A first analysis of chromatin assembled in 6-DMAP-treated extracts has revealed that this chromatin does not contain MCM3, whereas subunits of ORC (6.Rowles A. Chong P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19.Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W.

Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) are efficiently bound. Hence, one effect of 6-DMAP is to inhibit the assembly of the MCM complex onto chromatin through an ORC- and CDC6-independent mechanism. The mechanism by which the MCM complex associates with chromatin is not known. Soluble MCM proteins form complexes containing the six related MCM subunits in Xenopus (10.Madine M.A. Khoo C.-Y.

Acta. 1998; 1398: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). A soluble heterohexameric MCM complex appears to be made by association of two distinct subcomplexes: one containing MCM3 and MCM5 proteins that are in tight association with each other and another containing MCM4, -6, and -7 with which MCM2 is weakly associated (12.ThoÃàmmes P. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22.CoueÃÅ M. Amariglio F. Maiorano D. Bocquet S. MeÃÅchali M. Exp.

Analysis of MCM proteins in different systems has suggested that discrete MCM subcomplexes may exist in equilibrium with each other (25.Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Tye B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 26.Su T.T. Feger G. O'Farrell P.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 27.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Although their biological significance is still unclear, some specific roles for MCM subcomplexes are emerging. A subcomplex of MCM2, -4, -6, and -7 proteins may bind histone H3, probably tethered by MCM2, whereas a subcomplex of MCM3 and MCM5 has no affinity for this substrate (28.Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). A DNA helicase activity has been reported to be associated with a subcomplex made of MCM4, -6, and -7 proteins in HeLa cells, and this activity appears to be inhibited by MCM2 (27.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). MCM4 and MCM6 may differentially contribute to the helicase activity of the MCM4¬∑MCM6¬∑MCM7 subcomplex (29.You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). No helicase activity has been detected for the whole purified MCM complex (30.Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cell. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), suggesting that distinct subunits of the MCM complex may have specific roles in DNA replication. Here we show that discrete MCM subunits of the MCM complex are already bound to chromatin before its complete licensing for DNA replication. Chromatin obtained by interference with the licensing reaction was found to contain bound distinct subunits of the MCM complex. The presence of an intermediate step in the assembly of the MCM complex onto chromatin was confirmed by reconstitution experiments in vitro and by kinetic analysis of formation of the pre-replication complex. These observations reveal that specific MCM subcomplexes are components of pre-replicative chromatin and that the assembly of the MCM proteins is an ordered process that leads to formation of the pre-replication complex. Interphasic low speed supernatants (LSSs) were prepared as described (31.Menut S. Lemaƒ±ÃÇtre J.-M. Hair A. MeÃÅchali M. Richter J.D. Advances in Molecular Biology: A Comparative Methods Approach to the Study of Ooocytes and Embryos. Oxford University Press, Oxford1988: 196-226Google Scholar). Interphasic high speed supernatants were prepared as described (32.MeÃÅchali M. Harland R.M. Cell. 1982; 30: 93-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 6-DMAP-treated extracts were prepared as described (1.Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Extracts were made 3% (w/v) with glycerol (1% for 6-DMAP-treated extracts), frozen in liquid nitrogen in 50-Œºl aliquots, and stored at ‚àí80 ¬∞C. Before use, aliquots were thawed, pooled, and supplemented with an ATP regeneration system (10 mm creatine phosphate, 10 Œºg/ml creatine kinase, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm MgCl2) and cycloheximide (250 Œºg/ml; Sigma). The B24 monoclonal antibody has been previously described (22.CoueÃÅ M. Amariglio F. Maiorano D. Bocquet S. MeÃÅchali M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 33.Bucci S. Ragghianti M. Nardi I. Bellini M. Mancino G. Lacroix J.-C. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 37: 509-517PubMed Google Scholar). The B24 antibody obtained from mice ascites was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation as described (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991Google Scholar). Antibodies specific forXenopus MCM proteins were a generous gift of Dr. H. Takisawa (University of Kyoto, Kyoto, Japan). The Xenopus ORC1 antibody was a gift from J. J. Blow (University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom). The MCM peptide antibody was raised against a peptide bearing the Xenopus MCM signature (a motif), which is highly conserved in the MCM2‚Äì7 proteins (35.Hu B. Burkhart D. Sculte D. Musahl C. Knippers R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5289-5293Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The peptide COOH-VCCIDEFDKMNDMDRT-NH2 was synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1991Google Scholar), and injected into two different rabbits (500 Œºg/injection/rabbit). Western blot signals were detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The B24 antibody was added to Xenopus egg extracts (high speed supernatant) diluted 5-fold with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors (5 Œºg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin and pepstatin; Sigma). Immunocomplexes were allowed to form by incubation on a rotating wheel at 4 ¬∞C for 30 min; protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added; and incubation was continued for 30 min under the same conditions. Immunocomplexes were recovered by low speed centrifugation and washed five times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors, and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer. For immunodepletion, either the B24 antibody or control mouse IgGs were coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (2:1, v/v) for 1 h at room temperature on a rotating wheel. Coupled IgGs were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and finally with XB buffer (100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.7), and 50 mm sucrose with protease inhibitors). One hundred microliters of Xenopus LSS were supplemented with cycloheximide and double-depleted with a 50% volume of protein G beads (Sigma) coupled to either the B24 antibody or control mouse IgGs by incubation for 40 min at 4 ¬∞C. Supernatants were recovered by low speed centrifugation at 4 ¬∞C and supplemented with an energy regeneration system, demembranated sperm nuclei as required, and [Œ±-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The B24 antibody or control IgGs were covalently coupled to protein G beads as described (36.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 522-523Google Scholar). The beads were incubated with Xenopus egg extracts (LSS) for 40 min at 4 ¬∞C on a rotating wheel and separated by low speed centrifugation at 4 ¬∞C. The beads were thoroughly washed with XB buffer on ice in the presence of protease inhibitors. Proteins specifically bound to the beads were eluted first with 2 volumes of XB buffer + 1.5 m NaCl for 10 min on ice, washed with XB buffer, and then re-eluted with 2 volumes of glycine (pH 2.5). Proteins eluted with glycine were immediately neutralized by addition of 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris (pH 8.8). Eluted proteins were simultaneously dialyzed against XB buffer and concentrated at 0.5 mg/ml by centrifugation in a Microcon-10 (Amicon, Inc.) at 4 ¬∞C. Fractions were stored as aliquots at ‚àí20 ¬∞C in 10% glycerol. About 3 Œºg (2 Œºl) of either the B24 antibody or control mouse IgGs (eluted from protein G-Sepharose beads) were added to 30 Œºl of aXenopus LSS and incubated on a rotating wheel at 4 ¬∞C for 30 min. Following incubation, extracts were supplemented with an energy regeneration system and demembranated sperm nuclei (4 ng/Œºl), and incubation was continued at 23 ¬∞C for 15 min. For heat inactivation, the B24 antibody was boiled for 5 min in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol, cooled immediately on ice, and then added to the reaction mixture. Chromatin was purified as described below. Demembranated sperm nuclei were prepared as described (31.Menut S. Lemaƒ±ÃÇtre J.-M. Hair A. MeÃÅchali M. Richter J.D. Advances in Molecular Biology: A Comparative Methods Approach to the Study of Ooocytes and Embryos. Oxford University Press, Oxford1988: 196-226Google Scholar). Chromatin reconstituted inXenopus egg extracts was purified by the modification of a previously described protocol (37.CoueÃÅ M. Kearsey S.E. MeÃÅchali M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted 4-fold in ice-cold chromatin purification buffer (50 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.7), 2% sucrose, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 Œºg/ml leupeptin, 5 Œºg/ml aprotinin, and 5 Œºg/ml pepstatin). Chromatin was purified by centrifugation at 6000 √ó g for 5 min at 4 ¬∞C through a 1.5-ml 0.7 m sucrose cushion made in chromatin purification buffer without Nonidet P-40 in a microcentrifuge. Pellets were washed once with chromatin purification buffer, and proteins were eluted with 2√ó Laemmli buffer. MCM-depleted or 6-DMAP-treated chromatin was obtained by incubation of demembranated sperm nuclei (30‚Äì50 ng/Œºl) in the corresponding extracts for 15 min at 23 ¬∞C. Chromatin was purified as described above, except that Nonidet P-40 was omitted, and pellets were resuspended in XB buffer. Samples were frozen as 5-Œºl aliquots in liquid nitrogen and stored at ‚àí80 ¬∞C as described (6.Rowles A. Chong P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). MCM-depleted or 6-DMAP-treated chromatin was reconstituted in vitro with purified MCM subcomplexes as follows. About 10 ng of MCM-depleted chromatin or 20 ng of 6-DMAP-treated chromatin were incubated with fractions eluted from the B24 immunocomplex (1 Œºl) for 15 min at 23 ¬∞C. After incubation, 1 Œºl of the reaction was mixed with 9 Œºl of either MCM- or mock-depleted Xenopus interphasic extract (LSS), and DNA replication was monitored over 90 min at 23 ¬∞C. In vitroreconstituted chromatin was purified as described in the specific chromatin purification section. Chromatin formed inXenopus egg extracts was fixed and observed by immunofluorescence microscopy as described (37.CoueÃÅ M. Kearsey S.E. MeÃÅchali M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1085-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using an inverted Zeiss Axioscope. MCM proteins associate with chromatin very rapidly on exit from metaphase (4.Lemaƒ±ÃÇtre J.-M. Geraud G. MeÃÅchali M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1159-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using Xenopus DNA replication in vitro systems, we had previously observed that the MCM4 protein associates with chromatin more rapidly than MCM3 (22.CoueÃÅ M. Amariglio F. Maiorano D. Bocquet S. MeÃÅchali M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To test whether MCM4 would bind to chromatin independently of MCM3, we interfered with the association of MCM3 with chromatin using a specific monoclonal antibody (see ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures‚Äù). This antibody immunoprecipitated MCM3 (Fig.1 A) and also efficiently removed the five related MCM proteins from Xenopus S-phase egg extracts (Fig. 1 B), consistent with these proteins forming a stable complex in solution (10.Madine M.A. Khoo C.-Y. Mills A.D. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 375: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 12.ThoÃàmmes P. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22.CoueÃÅ M. Amariglio F. Maiorano D. Bocquet S. MeÃÅchali M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). When the MCM3-specific antibody was added to an interphasic Xenopusegg extract, the association of MCM3 with chromatin was severely inhibited (Fig. 1 C, lane 2), whereas addition of control IgGs did not have any effect (lane 1). The presence of the MCM3-specific antibody also caused inhibition of DNA replication, as expected when chromatin is not fully licensed (Ref. 13.Tanaka T. Knapp D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholarand data not shown). The binding of MCM3 to chromatin was not affected when the antibody was heat-inactivated (lane 3) or once licensing had already occurred, i.e. 15 min after addition of sperm chromatin (lane 4). In contrast to what was observed with MCM3, MCM4 could still bind chromatin under these conditions (Fig. 1 C), as could ORC1 (Fig. 1 C), which is not complexed with MCM proteins in solution (6.Rowles A. Chong P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We conclude that MCM4 binds to chromatin when the binding of the MCM3 protein is specifically blocked, demonstrating that MCM4 can associate with chromatin independently of MCM3. In Xenopus, the association of the MCM3 protein with chromatin can be blocked with 6-DMAP, an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein kinases, resulting in inhibition of the initiation of DNA replication (1.Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 5.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 6.Rowles A. Chong P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). 6-DMAP inhibits the activity of the licensing factor, which normally limits DNA replication to only one round in each S- phase (1.Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether the binding of MCM4 to chromatin could be affected by 6-DMAP as supplementary evidence that MCM4-chromatin binding can be uncoupled from that of MCM3. We have biochemically characterized chromatin obtained in Xenopus egg extracts treated with 6-DMAP. Addition of 6-DMAP to metaphase-arrested extracts inhibits by >90% DNA replication following release into interphase (Ref. 1.Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar and data not shown). The presence of 6-DMAP completely abolished the association of MCM3 with chromatin, as expected (Fig.2 A); however, the MCM4 protein was found to be specifically bound to 6-DMAP-treated chromatin. The specific binding of MCM4 to 6-DMAP-treated chromatin was also confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy with specific antibodies (Fig.2 C). Previous characterization of chromatin formed in 6-DMAP-treated extracts has shown that the ORC1, ORC2, and CDC6 proteins are bound (5.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 6.Rowles A. Chong P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 19.Carpenter P.B. Mueller P.R. Dunphy W. Nature. 1995; 379: 357-360Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar), but it is not known whether 6-DMAP interferes with the binding of all MCM subunits. Analysis of MCM proteins bound to 6-DMAP-treated chromatin showed that in addition to MCM3, the binding of MCM2, -5, and -7 proteins is also largely repressed. Surprisingly, we observed that MCM6 could be recovered on this chromatin at almost physiological levels (70% of the control) (Fig. 2, A and B). We conclude that 6-DMAP does not inhibit the association of two MCM subunits (MCM4 and MCM6) with chromatin and that a whole MCM complex is not required for the retention of these subunits on chromatin. One implication of these observations is that the MCM4¬∑MCM6 subcomplex may be a stable intermediate of the licensing reaction. To determine whether formation of a heterohexameric MCM2‚Äì7 complex is required for the association of distinct MCM subunits with chromatin, we performed reconstitution experimentsin vitro with MCM subcomplexes isolated from interphasic, replication-competent Xenopus egg extracts. These were obtained by stepwise elution of the MCM2‚Äì7 complex immunopurified with the MCM3-specific monoclonal antibody. The first fraction, obtained by high salt wash, contained the six MCM subunits (Fig.3 A, Eluates,1.5M NaCl), whereas the second fraction, obtained by an additional wash at low pH (Glycine), contained the MCM3¬∑MCM5 subcomplex. These purified fractions were incubatedin vitro either with chromatin lacking all MCM subunits (MCM-dep chr) or with chromatin assembled in the presence of 6-DMAP (6-DMAP chr; see the experimental procedure outlined in Fig. 3 B). The ability of the MCM3 protein to bind chromatin was determined by Western blotting. Incubation of the total MCM complex with either MCM-depleted or 6-DMAP-treated chromatin restored the binding of MCM3 (Fig. 3 C). The MCM3¬∑MCM5 subcomplex was not sufficient to allow binding of MCM3 to chromatin lacking all MCM subunits. In contrast, the same MCM3¬∑MCM5 subcomplex was sufficient to restore binding of MCM3 to 6-DMAP-treated chromatin, which, as we have shown (Fig. 2), already contains bound MCM4 and MCM6 proteins. These results indicate that the isolated MCM3¬∑MCM5 subcomplex only binds to chromatin if the MCM4 and MCM6 proteins are bound. The replication competence of in vitro reconstituted chromatin was determined by incubation in an extract lacking MCM proteins (Fig. 3 D). As expected, chromatin lacking MCM proteins (MCM-dep chr) did not replicate in an extract that did not contain MCM proteins (Fig. 3 D, bar 2) compared with a control incubation in a mock-depleted extract (bar 1). The total MCM complex did stimulate replication of both MCM-depleted chromatin (bar 3) and 6-DMAP-treated chromatin (bar 6), demonstrating that the purified MCM complex is functional. In contrast, the MCM3¬∑MCM5 subcomplex did not stimulate the replication of 6-DMAP-treated chromatin (bar 7), despite the fact that the binding of MCM3 was restored (Fig.3 C). Thus, rescue of DNA replication in MCM-depleted extracts is obtained only by re-addition of all six MCM subunits, confirming previous observations (11.Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S.-I. Masuda T. Nojima H. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that (a) the association of the MCM3¬∑MCM5 subcomplex with chromatin is dependent upon the presence of the MCM4 and MCM6 proteins; (b) a whole MCM complex is not required for the association of the MCM3 and MCM5 subunits with chromatin; and (c) the binding of MCM3 to 6-DMAP-treated chromatin is not sufficient to restore DNA replication. In support of these results, we have analyzed in detail the kinetics of the association of all MCM subunits with chromatin by both indirect immunofluorescence and Western blotting with specific antibodies. The analysis was performed during the first minutes of incubation of demembranated sperm nuclei in an interphasicXenopus egg extract, i.e. before the formation of the nuclear membrane. During the first minute of the time course (Fig.4 A), MCM4 and MCM6 proteins associated with chromatin very rapidly. The MCM3 protein was detected on chromatin only at a later stage (5‚Äì10 min), and the rapid accumulation of MCM6 compared with MCM3 was confirmed by Western blot analysis of chromatin fractions (Fig. 4 B). Quantification of the signals obtained by Western blotting and determination of the MCM3/MCM6 signal ratio during the kinetics of chromatin association clearly confirmed that MCM6 binds chromatin with faster kinetics than does MCM3 (Fig. 4 C). These data are in agreement with the results obtained with 6-DMAP and with the in vitroreconstitution experiments showing that MCM4 and MCM6 are required to prime the assembly of the MCM complex. MCM7, which in solution forms a stable complex with MCM4 and MCM6 (22.CoueÃÅ M. Amariglio F. Maiorano D. Bocquet S. MeÃÅchali M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), surprisingly began to accumulate on chromatin only 5 min after incubation (Fig.4 B), suggesting that its loading or stabilization may be time-dependent. MCM5 bound to chromatin with kinetics similar to those of MCM7 (Ref. 20.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Laskey R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and data not shown). ORC1 bound to chromatin very rapidly, as rapidly as MCM4 and MCM6 (Fig.4 B), but reached maximal levels of accumulation before chromatin was fully loaded with all MCM proteins. The very rapid accumulation of ORC1 is consistent with the notion that ORC is required for the association of MCM proteins with chromatin (5.Coleman T.R. Carpenter P.B. Dunphy G. Cell. 1996; 87: 53-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 6.Rowles A. Chong P.J. Brown L. Howell M. Evan G.I. Blow J.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 7.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We conclude that MCM2‚Äì7 proteins associate with chromatin with distinct kinetics. MCM4 and MCM6 are the first MCM proteins to accumulate significantly on chromatin at an early step in the licensing reaction, with kinetics similar to those of ORC1. In this study, we report the first comprehensive analysis of the assembly of the MCM2‚Äì7 complex onto pre-replicative chromatin. In contrast with the observation that all six MCM proteins are associated in a complex in solution and are therefore expected to bind chromatin as a whole heterohexameric complex, we have revealed the existence of discrete subunits of the MCM complex bound to chromatin during formation of the pre-replication complex. Only once formation of pre-replication complexes had been completed were all MCM proteins observed on chromatin. We have identified MCM4 and MCM6 proteins as a stable intermediate of the assembly of the MCM2‚Äì7 proteins onto pre-replicative chromatin. This intermediate was observed at an early step in the licensing reaction and also when the licensing reaction was blocked with 6-DMAP. Hence, 6-DMAP may interfere with a phosphorylation event required for either the assembly or the stabilization of a subset of MCM proteins on chromatin, but the binding of MCM4 and MCM6 does not depend on this regulation. Similar results were obtained by interference with the chromatin binding of MCM3 with a specific antibody, a treatment that did not prevent MCM4 from binding to chromatin. Given that MCM3 and MCM5 proteins cannot bind chromatin devoid of MCM4 and MCM6 subunits, the assembly of MCM4 and MCM6 proteins may represent a priming step in the chromatin assembly of the MCM proteins. The inability of the MCM3¬∑MCM5 subcomplex to bind chromatin lacking all MCM subunits also indicates that this subcomplex has low affinity for chromatin and is consistent with previous observations showing that an MCM3¬∑MCM5 subcomplex from HeLa cells has no affinity for histones (28.Ishimi Y. Ichinose S. Omori A. Sato K. Kimura H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24115-24122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The in vitro reconstitution experiments confirm that isolated MCM subcomplexes can bind chromatin, suggesting that formation of a heterohexameric complex made of the six MCM subunits is not required for the binding of MCM proteins or for their retention on chromatin. They also indicate that a full MCM complex is required for DNA replication in Xenopus egg extracts, in agreement with previous findings showing that all six MCM proteins are required to rescue DNA replication in MCM-depleted extracts (10.Madine M.A. Khoo C.-Y. Mills A.D. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 375: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 11.Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S.-I. Masuda T. Nojima H. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 20.Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Laskey R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and that a crude preparation of MCM proteins (replication licensing factor-M) can rescue the replication defect of 6-DMAP-treated extracts (9.Chong J.P. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). However, purified replication licensing factor-M appears to require an additional fraction, replication licensing factor-B, to restore licensing in 6-DMAP-treated extracts (9.Chong J.P. Mahbubani H.M. Khoo C.-Y. Blow J.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 418-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that replication licensing factor-B may be an activity needed to assemble and/or stabilize part of the MCM complex on chromatin. Purification and characterization of this activity will be of great interest to elucidate the regulation of assembly of the MCM proteins onto chromatin. Analysis of the assembly of the MCM proteins onto chromatin during the licensing reaction has revealed that MCM proteins are loaded in at least two steps. The first step (1‚Äì3 min) involves the rapid binding of MCM4 and MCM6 as well as MCM2 (22.CoueÃÅ M. Amariglio F. Maiorano D. Bocquet S. MeÃÅchali M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This step correlates with the accumulation of ORC1 on chromatin, raising the possibility that at this stage of the licensing reaction, ORC1 and the MCM2, -4, and -6 proteins may physically interact. A physical interaction between ORC1 and MCM4 has been reported in whole cell extracts of fission yeast (38.Grallert B. Nurse P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2644-2654Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The assembly of this intermediate may represent a pre-licensing step that is not inhibited by 6-DMAP. In the second step (>5 min), all MCM proteins accumulate at high levels on chromatin, suggesting that this step may be dependent on pre-licensing. Given that all MCM subunits are required to license for replication (Refs. 11.Kubota Y. Mimura S. Nishimoto S.-I. Masuda T. Nojima H. Takisawa H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3320-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar and 12.ThoÃàmmes P. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar and this work), these observations may explain why demembranated sperm nuclei acquire the ‚Äúlicense‚Äù to replicate only after 15 min of incubation inXenopus interphasic extracts (1.Blow J.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 993-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), as this is the minimal time required to complete the third step in the licensing reaction,i.e. the assembly of all MCM2‚Äì7 subunits onto chromatin. MCM7 accumulated on chromatin only at a later stage of the licensing reaction, suggesting that it may require either previous binding of other MCM subunits or a stabilization event that is time-dependent. This finding is consistent with the absence of MCM7 in 6-DMAP-treated chromatin and strengthens the notion that 6-DMAP interferes with a step in the assembly of a subset of MCM subunits. In solution, MCM7 forms a strong complex with two other MCM proteins, MCM4 and MCM6 (12.ThoÃàmmes P. Kubota Y. Takisawa H. Blow J.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 22.CoueÃÅ M. Amariglio F. Maiorano D. Bocquet S. MeÃÅchali M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 245: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); and this complex, purified from HeLa cells, has been shown to have DNA helicase activity, which may be relevant to the unwinding step of initiation of DNA replication (27.Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24508-24513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The helicase activity of the MCM4¬∑MCM6¬∑MCM7 subcomplex is inhibited by addition of the MCM2 protein, and no helicase activity is associated with a heterohexameric complex made of the six distinct MCM subunits (30.Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cell. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We speculate that formation of the MCM4¬∑MCM6¬∑MCM7 complex on chromatin is regulated, perhaps being remodeled in an active form only after formation of the nuclear membrane, when S-phase cyclin-dependent kinases are active and initiation of DNA replication is allowed. The evidence presented here shows that MCM2‚Äì7 proteins are loaded onto chromatin sequentially, whereas in solution, these proteins are associated in a heterohexameric complex. We envisage two models that can explain how MCM2‚Äì7 proteins are loaded onto pre-replicative chromatin. In the first model, MCM subunits are delivered to chromatin from the soluble MCM complex, perhaps with the collaboration of ‚Äúchaperon-like‚Äù proteins. In the second model, MCM proteins bind to chromatin as a heterohexameric complex, but during the licensing reaction, this complex is unstable. MCM subunits with high affinity for chromatin targets (e.g. MCM4 and MCM6; see also Ref. 29.You Z. Komamura Y. Ishimi Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8003-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) would be the first to be stabilized, whereas others would be more sensitive to dissociation. We favor the second model, which is supported by our in vitro reconstitution experiments showing that purified MCM proteins do not need to be assembled into a full heterohexameric complex in order to bind chromatin. This second model is consistent with a model recently proposed for the loading of MCM2‚Äì7 proteins onto pre-replicative chromatin in yeast (39.Perkins G. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which parallels the loading of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a DNA polymerase-Œ¥ processivity factor. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen in solution is a ring-shaped homotrimeric protein that binds to the DNA substrate, forming an unstable intermediate. ATP hydrolysis by the replication factor C complex causes a conformational change that promotes opening of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen ring and its reformation around DNA, a reaction that is highly regulated (40.Tsurimoto T. Stillman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1950-1960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22698-22706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subunits of ORC and the CDC6 protein, which are required for the loading of MCM2‚Äì7 proteins onto chromatin, share significant sequence homology with subunits of replication factor C, and genetic evidence in yeast suggests that CDC6 requires ATP hydrolysis to load MCM proteins onto chromatin (39.Perkins G. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 23-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 42.DeRyckere D. Smith C.L. Martin G.S. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Weinreich M. Liang C. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, the soluble heterohexameric MCM complex, which appears to form a ring in solution (30.Adachi Y. Usukura J. Yanagida M. Genes Cell. 1997; 2: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), may contact chromatin via specific MCM subunits (MCM2, -4, and -6,) forming an unstable intermediate. A phosphorylation event sensitive to 6-DMAP and ATP hydrolysis, presumably mediated by ORC and CDC6, will be required to stabilize the MCM complex on chromatin, completing the licensing reaction. The observation of the assembly of MCM proteins onto chromatin through distinct MCM subcomplexes suggests an additional level of regulation for the initiation of DNA replication. One intermediate step in the assembly of MCM proteins is sensitive to 6-DMAP, suggesting that it is regulated by the activity of protein kinase(s). These data also raise the question of whether MCM proteins reassemble in a whole heterohexameric complex onto chromatin or whether they distribute differentially at distinct sites, perhaps dynamically interacting in an ordered manner at discrete steps in the initiation reaction. The identification of the chromatin targets for MCM proteins and the analysis of their distribution on chromosomes will be of great importance in understanding the function of these universal regulators of the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes.

The APC gene is also somatically mutated in the majority of sporadic colorectal tumors. Both germline and somatic mutations of APC are almost exclusively either nonsense or frameshift mutations that result in truncation of the intact APC gene product. Consistent with its role as a tumor suppressor, overexpression of APC blocks cell cycle transition from the G1 to S phase (3.Baeg G.H. Matsumine A. Kuroda T. Bhattacharjee R.N. Miyashiro I.

Of particular interest is the fact that overexpression of APC promotes the degradation of Œ≤-catenin, an essential component of the Wnt signaling transduction pathway (13.Munemitsu S. Albert I.

The specific sites in APC to which Œ≤-catenin binds are the three 15-amino acid repeats and the seven more carboxyl-proximal 20-amino acid repeats, the latter of which are reported to be responsible for the degradation of Œ≤-catenin (17.Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4624-4630PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant APCs frequently found in colon cancers typically retain the three 15-amino acid repeats intact but lack all but one or two of the 20-amino acid repeats. In these cancers, degradation of Œ≤-catenin is impaired, resulting in its accumulation and formation of a stable, constitutively active complex with TCF, resulting in the activation of Wnt signaling target genes (18.Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar, 19.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V.

Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The degradation of Œ≤-catenin is believed to require glycogen synthase kinase-3Œ≤ (GSK-3Œ≤), which is thought to phosphorylate Œ≤-catenin and consequently induce its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in the absence of the Wnt signal (15.Miller J.R. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 16.Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2235) Google Scholar, 21.Aberle H.

Upon activation by the Wnt signal, GSK-3Œ≤ activity is inhibited, causing the accumulation of Œ≤-catenin. Œ≤-Catenin then associates with members of the TCF/lymphoid enhancer factor family of transcription factors, ultimately altering the expression of Wnt signaling target genes (23.Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

The amino-terminal domain of Œ≤-catenin contains four consensus motifs for phosphorylation by GSK-3Œ≤, and these sites have been found to be mutated in some colorectal tumors and other tumors with normal APC (19.Morin P.J.

Œ≤-Catenins mutated at these sites are stabilized and form constitutively active complexes with TCF, indicating that the accumulation of Œ≤-catenin per se is important in colorectal tumorigenesis. It has recently been shown that Axin, the mutation of which is known to induce axial duplication in the mouse (26.Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J.

Axin interacts with Œ≤-catenin, GSK-3Œ≤, and APC and induces the degradation of Œ≤-catenin when overexpressed in the human colorectal tumor cell line SW480 (27.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N.

Conductin/Axil, a molecule closely related to Axin, has also been shown to interact with Œ≤-catenin, GSK-3Œ≤, and APC and to induce the degradation of Œ≤-catenin (33.Behrens J.

In Axin and conductin/Axil, the sites responsible for binding to APC are the G-protein signaling (RGS) domains. The complementary sites in APC responsible for binding to Axin and conductin/Axil have been reported to reside between 20-amino acid repeat numbers 3 and 4 and 4 and 5 and downstream of repeat 7 (33.Behrens J.

The region of APC containing these sites is located just downstream of the mutation cluster region, suggesting that the interaction of APC with Axin and conductin/Axil is important to its tumor suppressor function (33.Behrens J.

In the present study, we examined whether degradation of Œ≤-catenin requires an association between APC and Axin. We demonstrate that disruption of the Axin-binding sites in APC abrogates its Œ≤-catenin-degrading activity. Also, overexpression of a fragment from Axin spanning the RGS domain inhibited APC-induced degradation of Œ≤-catenin. We also show that APC needs to be directly associated with Œ≤-catenin as well as with Axin to induce the degradation of Œ≤-catenin.

GST fusion proteins immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose were mixed with in vitro translated proteins in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNaVO4, 50 mm NaF, 10 Œºg/ml leupeptin, and 10 Œºg/ml aprotinin) containing 1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 ¬∞C and then washed extensively with buffer A. Proteins adhering to the beads were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The human colorectal cancer cell line SW480 was cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS-7 and SW480 cells were transfected with pEGFP-APC2‚Äì5, pMKITNeo-Axin-FLAG, and pCMV FLAG-Œ≤-catenin by using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were lysed in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. For identification of ubiquitinated Œ≤-catenin, cells were cultured for 24 h and then treated withN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal orN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methional (Sigma) for 12 h. The lysates were incubated with 2 Œºg of antibody to GFP (CLONTECH) for 1 h at 4 ¬∞C, and then the immunocomplexes were adsorbed to protein G-Sepharose 4B. After washing extensively with buffer A containing 0.1% Triton X-100, samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane filter (Immobilon P; Millipore). The blot was subjected to immunoblotting analysis using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Promega) as a secondary antibody. SW480 cells (3.5 √ó 105 cells/well) were transfected with 2 Œºg of pEGFP-APC2‚Äì5, -APCŒîAxin, or -APCŒîŒ≤-cat. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and dehydrated with 100% cold methanol. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal bovine serum, Œ≤-catenin and GFP were detected with anti-Œ≤-catenin monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (Invitrogen), respectively. For secondary antibodies, rhodamine isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse antibodies (Cappel) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies (Cappel) were used at dilutions of 1:50. SW480 cells (3.5 √ó 105cells/well) were transfected by LipofectAMINE with a total of 2.2 Œºg of the various combinations of plasmids: 0.1 Œºg of luciferase reporter plasmid (pTBE2 or pTBE2m), 0.1 Œºg of internal control pRL-TK vector (Promega), 0.4 Œºg of pEGFP-APC2‚Äì5 and/or 0‚Äì1.6 Œºg of pMKITNeo-Axin-RGS, and empty pMKITNeo vector as stuffer. pTBE2 reporter contains four copies of the optimized TCF-binding site inserted upstream of a minimal promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene (pBV-Luc), whereas pTBE2m contains mutated sites that do not bind TCF (40.He T.C. Sparks A.B. Rago C. Hermeking H. Zawel L. da Costa L.T. Morin P.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1998; 281: 1509-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (4092) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were measured 48 h after transfection using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by normalizing to the control pRL-TK activity. To elucidate the mechanism by which APC mediates degradation of Œ≤-catenin, we used a fragment of APC containing 20-amino acid repeats numbers 2‚Äì5 (APC2‚Äì5). This fragment was previously shown to be able to induce the degradation of Œ≤-catenin (Ref. 17.Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4624-4630PubMed Google Scholar; Fig.1). APC2‚Äì5 also contains two of the three repeated sequences that were previously reported to be responsible for its interaction with the Axin-related protein conductin/Axil (33.Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). These two elements are located between 20-amino acid repeats 3 and 4 and 4 and 5, respectively. We therefore generated a mutant, APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin, in which Glu-Cys-Ile-Ile and Glu-Cys-Ile-Asn in the first and second elements, respectively, were deleted (Fig. 1). In addition, we constructed a mutant APC2‚Äì5ŒîŒ≤-cat, in which three amino acids in each of 20-amino acid repeats 2‚Äì5 had been mutated, as shown in Fig. 1. We first confirmed that the mutant APC fragments, APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin and APC2‚Äì5ŒîŒ≤-cat, are deficient in their interaction with Axin and Œ≤-catenin, respectively. We produced these fragments by in vitro translation and examined their ability to interact with the RGS domain of Axin and the armadillo repeat domain of Œ≤-catenin, each fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST-Axin and GST-Œ≤-catenin, respectively). As shown in Fig.2, the intact APC fragment, APC2‚Äì5, interacted with both GST-Axin and GST-Œ≤-catenin. However, APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin was found to interact only with GST-Œ≤-catenin and not with GST-Axin, whereas APC2‚Äì5ŒîŒ≤-cat interacted only with GST-Axin and not with GST-Œ≤-catenin. Neither the intact APC fragment nor mutant APC fragments interacted with GST alone. We next examined whether these mutants behave similarly in vivo. APC2‚Äì5, APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin, and APC2‚Äì5ŒîŒ≤-cat were expressed as fusions with GFP, allowing their detection with anti-GFP antibody. COS-7 cells were transfected with each of these constructs along with FLAG-tagged Œ≤-catenin or FLAG-tagged Axin, and lysates from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-GFP antibody, followed by fractionation by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with antibodies to FLAG or GFP. APC2‚Äì5 was found to coimmunoprecipitate with either Œ≤-catenin or Axin. In contrast, APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin precipitated with Œ≤-catenin but not with Axin, whereas APC2‚Äì5ŒîŒ≤-cat precipitated with Axin but not with Œ≤-catenin (Fig.3). These results, together with those obtained in vitro, suggest that APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin and APC2‚Äì5ŒîŒ≤-cat are specifically defective in their ability to interact with Axin and Œ≤-catenin, respectively. The human colorectal cancer cell line SW480 expresses only a truncated mutant APC, which lacks the three Axin- and conductin/Axil-binding sites and six of the seven 20-amino acid repeats (13.Munemitsu S. Albert I. Souza B. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3046-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar). Œ≤-Catenin accumulates in this cell line, and Œ≤-catenin-TCF-mediated transcription is constitutively activated (18.Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2950) Google Scholar, 19.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W.

Science. 1997; 275: 1790-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). We transfected the intact and mutant APC fragments we had generated into SW480 cells and compared their abilities to induce the degradation of Œ≤-catenin. Cells transfected with the APC plasmids were detected by staining with anti-GFP antibody, and Œ≤-catenin levels were measured by staining with anti-Œ≤-catenin antibody. As shown in Fig.4 A, expression of neither APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin nor APCŒîŒ≤-cat caused any reduction in Œ≤-catenin levels, whereas expression of APC2‚Äì5 caused a substantial reduction in Œ≤-catenin levels. Western blotting analysis confirmed that the Œ≤-catenin levels were lower in cells transfected with APC2‚Äì5 but not in those transfected with APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin or APCŒîŒ≤-cat (Fig.4 B). We also examined whether APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin or APC2‚Äì5ŒîŒ≤-cat exerted any effect on Œ≤-catenin-TCF-regulated transcription in SW480 cells. We transfected the intact APC fragment or the two mutated APC fragments into SW480 cells along with a reporter plasmid that contains optimal TCF-binding sites upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (36.He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, APC2‚Äì5 repressed the activity of the reporter gene, but APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin and APC2‚Äì5ŒîŒ≤-cat failed to repress activity. Transcriptional activation was not observed with a reporter gene containing mutated TCF-binding sites. These results suggest that APC requires interaction with Axin and Œ≤-catenin for APC-mediated degradation of Œ≤-catenin. Because APC binds to the RGS domain of Axin, we examined the effect of overexpressing an Axin fragment spanning the RGS domain (Axin-RGS) on APC-mediated repression of Œ≤-catenin-TCF-regulated transcription in SW480 cells. SW480 cells were transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid described above, along with APC2‚Äì5 and increasing amounts of Axin-RGS. As shown in Fig. 6, coexpression of Axin-RGS inhibited the ability of APC2‚Äì5 to repress the luciferase reporter in a dose-dependent manner. This result suggests that overexpressed Axin-RGS competes with endogenous Axin for binding to APC and thereby interferes with the function of APC. This finding supports the idea that the association of APC with Axin is important for its Œ≤-catenin degrading activity. Œ≤-Catenin has been reported to be ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome (21.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 22.Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of APC2‚Äì5 and APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin on ubiquitination of Œ≤-catenin in SW480 cells. When SW480 cells were transfected with APC2‚Äì5 and cultured in the presence of the peptide aldehyde proteasomal inhibitorN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, higher molecular weight forms of Œ≤-catenin, which have been reported to be ubiquitinated forms of Œ≤-catenin (21.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 22.Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), were detected by Western blotting analysis (Fig.7). As reported previously (21.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 22.Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), higher molecular weight forms of Œ≤-catenin were not detected when cells were cultured in the presence of the related peptide aldehyde calpain protease inhibitor N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-methional that has 50- to 100-fold lower potency as a proteasomal inhibitor. In contrast, overexpression of APC2‚Äì5ŒîAxin in the presence ofN-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal failed to generate higher molecular weight forms of Œ≤-catenin (Fig. 7). These results suggest that APC needs to interact with Axin to induce ubiquitination of Œ≤-catenin. The majority of the somatic mutations in APC found in colon cancers are confined to its central region, called the mutation cluster region, and they typically result in the generation of truncated gene products (1.Polakis P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F127-F147PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1996; 87: 159-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4286) Google Scholar). The 3‚Ä≤ boundary of the mutation cluster region resides at approximately codon 1,500, and typical mutant APCs lack five or more of the 20-amino acid repeat regions important for the degradation of Œ≤-catenin (17.Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4624-4630PubMed Google Scholar). The sites of Axin and conductin/Axil interaction are also contained in this region, between the 20-amino acid repeats 3 and 4, 4 and 5, and downstream of repeat 7 (33.Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the importance of Axin interaction in the ability of APC to degrade Œ≤-catenin. When we took a fragment of APC, APC2‚Äì5 (the expression of which is sufficient to induce ubiquitination and degradation of Œ≤-catenin), and mutated it so as to disrupt Axin-binding sites 1 and 2, it lost the ability to induce ubiquitination and degradation of Œ≤-catenin. Furthermore, this mutant fragment, APCŒîAxin, also could not inhibit Œ≤-catenin-TCF-mediated transactivation. These results suggest that Axin plays an essential role in APC-mediated degradation of Œ≤-catenin and that the interaction of APC with Axin may be important in its tumor suppressor function. It is also possible that conductin/Axil is important in APC-mediated down-regulation of Œ≤-catenin. Although the RGS domains of some proteins are known to be involved in the interaction between GTPase-activating proteins and the Gi subfamily of GŒ± subunits (37.Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 38.De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), the amino acid sequence of the Axin RGS domain differs from other RGS proteins at several key residues (26.Zeng L. Fagotto F. Zhang T. Hsu W. Vasicek T.J. Perry III, W.L. Lee J.J. Tilghman S.M. Gumbiner B.M. Costantini F. Cell. 1997; 90: 181-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). We and others have found that the RGS domains of Axin and conductin/Axil are responsible for binding to APC (27.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Ikeda S. Kishida M. Sakamoto I. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). As another means to investigate the role of Axin interaction in APC-mediated degradation of Œ≤-catenin, we generated a fragment of Axin that contains the RGS domain and overexpressed it in cells. As expected, overexpression of this RGS domain interfered with APC-mediated degradation. Presumably, this interference is caused by a dominant-negative mechanism; i.e. the overexpressed RGS domain fragment competes with the endogenous Axin for binding to APC. This finding also supports the notion that APC needs to interact with Axin to induce the degradation of Œ≤-catenin. Œ≤-Catenin and GSK-3Œ≤ bind adjacently within the central region of Axin (27.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Axins that have been mutated to delete the Œ≤-catenin- or GSK-3Œ≤-binding regions fail to induce down-regulation of Œ≤-catenin expression when overexpressed in SW480 cells. From these results, Axin is assumed to facilitate the interaction of Œ≤-catenin with GSK-3Œ≤. Indeed, Axin has been shown to promote phosphorylation of Œ≤-catenin by GSK-3Œ≤ in vitro (28.Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar), although it remains to be shown that this occurs in vivo. Consistent with these findings, Axin was found to induce the degradation of Œ≤-catenin when overexpressed in SW480 cells. Because SW480 contains only a truncated form of APC, this finding indicates that Axin is able to induce Œ≤-catenin degradation when overexpressed, even in the absence of intact APC. In addition, mutant Axin lacking the APC-binding domain is still able to degrade Œ≤-catenin when overexpressed in SW480 cells (27.Hart M.J. de los Santos R. Albert I.N. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 573-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Itoh K. Krupnik V.E. Sokol S.Y. Curr.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2867-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, experiments using SW480 cells also indicate that endogenous expression of Axin is not sufficient to regulate the levels of Œ≤-catenin in the absence of APC. Thus, the associated Axin and APC may be more effective in inducing the formation of the complexes and, consequently, the interaction of molecules in the complexes than Axin alone. We also investigated the significance of the association of APC with Œ≤-catenin. We generated APCŒîŒ≤-cat, a derivative of APC2‚Äì5 in which all of the Œ≤-catenin-binding sites contained in APC2‚Äì5 have been mutated, and examined its Œ≤-catenin-degrading activity. Some Œ≤-catenin could still be associated indirectly with this mutant fragment because the fragment retains its association with Axin, which interacts with Œ≤-catenin. However, our results clearly showed that APCŒîŒ≤-cat is incapable of inducing the degradation of Œ≤-catenin. APCŒîŒ≤-cat also failed to inhibit Œ≤-catenin-TCF-mediated transactivation. Thus, APC needs to interact directly with Axin and Œ≤-catenin to efficiently induce the degradation of Œ≤-catenin. Although overexpression of Axin induces Œ≤-catenin-degradation in the absence of APC, endogenous Axin facilitates the degradation of Œ≤-catenin only when it is associated with APC in the complex.

Chem. 1999; 274: 29011-29018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, MutY represents a unique group of glycosylases. The structure and function of MutY have revealed several interesting aspects. Ethylation interference studies showed that MutY interacts with at least five phosphate groups and covers about 12 base pairs around the A/G mismatch (20.Lu A.-L. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Methylation interference experiments have demonstrated that MutY specifically interacts with both mispaired A and G as well as the two bases flanking the A/G mismatch (20.Lu A.-L. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This may explain the neighboring sequence effect on the repair efficiency of MutY. The MutY domain structure has been studied through proteolysis (37.Manuel R.C. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 39.Gogos A. Cillo J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16218-16226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have been shown to retain catalytic activity. Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MutY(D138N) (cdMutY) with bound adenine shows that the adenine is buried in the active site of the catalytic domain and suggests that the mismatched adenine must flip out of the DNA helix for the glycosylase action (24.Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In the active site pocket, several amino acids (Gln182, Glu37, and Asp186) are involved in adenine binding. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domains of MutY also suggests some candidate residues for the recognition of the base opposite adenine. We and Clarke's group (39.Gogos A. Cillo J. Clarke N.D. Lu A.-L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16665-16671Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 47.Noll D.M. Gogos A. Granek J.A. Clarke N.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6374-6579Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) have shown that the C-terminal domain of MutY plays an important role in the recognition of GO lesions while Manuel and Lloyd (37.Manuel R.C. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11140-11152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have not drawn the same conclusion. In this paper, we further investigated the role of the C-terminal domain of MutY. The truncated MutY construct, M25, has more than 18-fold lower affinities for binding 8-oxoG-containing mismatches tested, as compared with intact MutY. Deletion of the C-terminal domain reduces its catalytic preference for A/GO-DNA over A/G-DNA. MutY also exerted more inhibition on the catalytic activity of MutM (Fpg) protein than M25. Moreover, an E. coli mutY strain that produces an N-terminal 249-residue truncated MutY is a mutator. These findings strongly support the notion that repair of 8-oxoG is the major function of MutY and its 8-oxoG specificity is located mainly in the C-terminal domain. E. coli PR8 (Su‚àí lacZ X74 galU galK Smr), PR70 (like PR8 but micA68::Tn10Kan), and PR68 (like PR8 but micA68::mini Tn10KanmutL218::Tn10) were obtained from M. S. Fox. The N-terminal domain of the mutY gene corresponding to Met1 to Gln226 (M25) was polymerase chain reaction amplified from the pJTW10‚Äì12 plasmid (7.Tsai-Wu J.-J. Liu H.-F. Lu A.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Primer Chang 222 contains an NdeI site at the 5‚Ä≤ end of the coding sequence and primer Chang 223 contains a BamHI site after the stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified from agarose gels, cut with NdeI and BamHI, and cloned into anNdeI/BamHI-digested pET11a expression vector. The inserted MutY sequence in the resulting clone pJ16-146-13 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression of M25 was under the control of the T7 promoter. The expression host of the mutYmutants, PR70 harboring the ŒªDE3 lysogen, was constructed according to the procedures described by Invitrogen. E. coli strain PR70/DE3 harboring the expression plasmid containing M25 was grown in LB broth containing 50 Œºg/ml ampicillin at 37 ¬∞C. The expression of the protein was induced at anA 590 of 0.6 by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-Œ≤-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm to the culture at 20 ¬∞C. The cells were harvested 16 h later. The M25 domain was purified from 40 g of E. coliPR70/DE3 cells harboring the overproduction plasmid, similar to the method used with wild-type enzyme (7.Tsai-Wu J.-J. Liu H.-F. Lu A.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nicking of A/G-containing 20-mer DNA was monitored during the M25 protein purification. As judged on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, M25 was purified to >99% homogeneity (data not shown). The purification of homogeneous MutY protein from an overproducing E. coli JM109 strain, harboring pJTW10‚Äì12, has been described previously (7.Tsai-Wu J.-J. Liu H.-F. Lu A.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Both primers contain anEcoRI site at the 5‚Ä≤ end of the coding sequence or after the stop codon. The polymerase chain reaction product was purified from agarose gels, cut with EcoRI, and cloned into anEcoRI digested pKK223-3 expression vector. Expression of MutM protein was similar to that of M25 as mentioned above. MutM protein was purified to more than 95% homogeneity from E. coli JM109 cells harboring the overproduction plasmid by ammonium sulfate precipitation, phosphocellulose, hydroxylapatite, and heparin chromatographies similar to the method used with MutY enzyme (7.Tsai-Wu J.-J. Liu H.-F. Lu A.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of oligonucleotide pairs used in this study were as follows: 19-mer 5‚Ä≤-CCGAGGAATTXGCCTTCTG-3‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤-GCTCCTTAAYCGGAAGACG-5‚Ä≤ and 40-mer 5‚Ä≤-AATTGGGCTCCTCGAGGAATTXGCCTTCTGCAGGCATGCC-3‚Ä≤and 3‚Ä≤-CCCGAGGAGCTCCTTAAYCGGAAGACGTCCGTACGGGGCC-5‚Ä≤ (X= A, C, G, T, I, or U; Y = C, G, or GO). Oligonucleotides of 19-mer and 40-mer containing base mismatches were labeled at the 3‚Ä≤ or 5‚Ä≤ ends as described by Lu et al. (20.Lu A.-L. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After filling-in the sticky ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, the 19-mer and 40-mer were converted into 20-mer and 44-mer, respectively. DNA substrates containing U/G or U/GO (300 fmol) were fully converted to AP/G or AP/GO by treating with 1.5 units of E. coli uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG, Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 ¬∞C for 1 h in MutY buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 80 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.9% glycerol). The MutY activity assays with labeled oligonucleotide substrates were performed as described by Lu et al. (38.Lu A.-L. Yuen D.S. Cillo J. J. Biol.

MutY enzyme was diluted with diluent (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 Œºg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50% glycerol) before use. The MutY binding reaction mixture contains 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2.9% glycerol, 20 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 1.8 fmol of labeled DNA in a total volume of 10 Œºl. After incubation at 37 ¬∞C for 30 min, the mixtures were supplemented with 1.5 Œºl of 50% glycerol and analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels in 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA. To determine the K d values, nine different MutY enzyme concentrations were used to bind DNA substrates and experiments were repeated at least three times. Bands corresponding to enzyme-bound and free DNA were quantified from PhosphorImager images and K d values were obtained from analyses by a computer-fitted curve generated by the Enzfitter program (49.Leatherbarrow R.J. Enzfitter: A Nonlinear Regression Analysis Program for IBM PC. Elsevier Science Publisher BV, Amsterdam1987Google Scholar). Covalent complexes of M25 and MutY with 19-mer DNA substrates were formed in a reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2.9% glycerol, and 0.1 m NaBH4. A NaBH4 (1m) stock solution was freshly prepared and added immediately after the enzyme was added. After incubation at 37 ¬∞C for 30 min, 5√ó dye buffer (0.5 m sucrose, 15% SDS, 312.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.9, 10 mm EDTA, 5% Œ≤-mercaptoethanol, and 0.0025% bromphenol blue) was added to the samples, which were heated at 90 ¬∞C for 2 min and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS according to Laemmli (50.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar). The glycosylase assays were carried out similarly to the trapping assay except no NaBH4 was added. After incubation at 37 ¬∞C for various times, reaction mixtures were lyophilized, resuspended in 3 Œºl of formamide dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), heated at 90 ¬∞C for 2 min, and loaded onto 14% 7 m urea sequencing gels. For time course studies, after enzyme reaction at different time points, samples were immediately frozen at ‚àí70 ¬∞C, followed by heating at 90 ¬∞C for 30 min with 1 m piperidine, and then treated as the glycosylase reaction. The reaction mixture contained 1.8 fmol of duplex 20-mer DNA substrates and 0.09 nm MutM for C/GO, T/GO, and G/GO mismatches and 0.36 nm MutM for AP/GO mismatch, respectively, in the MutY buffer. The reaction was preincubated for 2 min at room temperature with increasing amounts of MutY, M25, or diluent. MutM was then added, and the reaction was further incubated at 37 ¬∞C for 28 min. Samples after reactions were lyophilized, resuspended in 3 Œºl of formamide dye, heated at 90 ¬∞C for 2 min, and loaded onto 14% 7 m urea sequencing gels. Proteins were resolved on a SDS-12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (51.Towbin H.T. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar). The membrane was subjected to the Enhanced Chemiluminescence analysis system from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech according to the manufacture's protocol. The anti-MutY antibodies were affinity purified by reaction with membrane-bound MutY protein (52.McGoldrick J.P. Yeh Y.-C. Solomon M. Essigmann J.M. Lu A.-L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 989-996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Independent overnight cultures (0.1 ml) of each strain were plated onto LB agar containing 0.1 mg/ml rifampicin. The cell titer of each culture was determined by plating a 10‚àí6 dilution onto LB agar. For each measurement, four independent cultures were plated and the experiments were repeated three times. The ratio of RifR cells to total cells was the mutation frequency. We have shown that MutY has much tighter binding, but weaker glycosylase activity to A/GO- than A/G-containing DNA at an enzyme/DNA molar ratio of 40 at 37 ¬∞C for 30 min in a steady-state kinetic study (38.Lu A.-L. Yuen D.S. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24138-24143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To further delineate the reactivity of MutY on different mismatches containing GO, we constructed A/GO, C/GO, G/GO, and T/GO duplex DNA substrates. As shown in Table I, the apparent dissociation constants (K d) of MutY with A/GO, G/GO, and T/GO are comparable. MutY binding to C/GO-containing DNA was 170-fold weaker than that with A/GO but only 2-fold weaker than that with A/G-containing DNA.Table IApparent dissociation constants of M25 and MutYDNA duplexMutY K dM25K dM25/MutYnmA/G-205.3 ¬± 0.5aDissociation constants for MutY are derived from Luet al.

We have shown that LNCaP cells are entirely resistant to Œ≥-radiation-induced apoptosis, but can be sensitized to irradiation by TNF-Œ±. Fas activation also sensitized LNCaP cells to irradiation, causing nearly 40% cell death 72 h after irradiation. Caspase-8 was cleaved and activated after exposure to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Œ±. However, after exposure to anti-Fas antibody caspase-8 cleavage occurred only between the 26-kDa N-terminal prodomain and the 28-kDa C-terminal region that contains the protease components. Although anti-Fas antibody plus irradiation induced apoptosis that could be blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD, there was no measurable caspase-8 activity after exposure to anti-Fas antibody. The effector caspases-6 and -7, and to a lesser extent caspase-3, were activated by TNF-Œ±, but not by anti-Fas antibody. Anti-Fas antibody, like TNF-Œ± also activated serine proteases that contributed to cell death. Exposure of LNCaP cells simultaneously to TNF-Œ± and anti-Fas antibody CH-11 resulted in marked enhancement of apoptosis that occurred very rapidly and was still further augmented by irradiation. Rapid apoptosis that ensued from combined treatment with TNF-Œ±, anti-Fas antibody, and irradiation was completely blocked either by zVAD or expression of dominant negative Fas-associated death domain. Our data shows that there are qualitative differences in caspase activation resulting from either TNF receptor 1 or Fas. Simultaneous activation of these receptors was synergistic and caused rapid epithelial cell apoptosis mediated by the caspase cascade.

Strategies to restore the cell death response to chemotherapy or radiation may reverse treatment resistance in some cancers. The prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, like most clinical prostate cancers, is dependent on androgens for growth and, like tumor tissue synthesizes the tissue-specific prostate-specific antigen, a serine protease (3.Horoszewicz J.S.

The hormone dependence of LNCaP cells is reminiscent of early stage prostate cancer, but the cells share characteristics of advanced prostate cancers in that they do not undergo apoptosis in response to either androgen deprivation or Œ≥-irradiation (7.DeWeese T.L.

We have shown that TNF-Œ±1 or C2-ceramide, at doses that, by themselves, induce little or no cell death, sensitize LNCaP cells to irradiation so that combined treatment with either TNF-Œ± and irradiation or C2-ceramide and irradiation induces death of the cultures (11.Kimura K. Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1606-1614PubMed Google Scholar). We have now studied the effect of Fas activation on the sensitivity of LNCaP cells to radiation-induced cell death. We have also found that Fas and TNF-Œ± have complementary effects on the activation of cell death pathways in LNCaP and together induced a markedly accelerated cell death response compared with activation of either TNFR-1 or Fas alone.TNF-Œ± is an inflammatory cytokine that can induce a diverse range of biological responses (12.Sherwood E.R.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 96-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Signaling by TNF-Œ± is initiated by binding to TNFR-1, which causes the association of an adapter protein TRADD with the intracellular death domain of the TNFR-1 molecule (14.Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). TRADD mediates the subsequent recruitment of an adapter protein FADD to form a death-inducing signaling complex, which initiates apoptosis through activation of caspase-8, a proximal element in the cascade of cysteine proteases (15.Grimm S.

Signaling by TNF-Œ± also activates anti-apoptotic cell signals via activation of the transcription factor NFŒ∫B that may override the effects of apoptosis pathways in some cells (26.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2441) Google Scholar, 27.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2926) Google Scholar).Signaling through Fas is thought to be less complex than signaling though TNFR-1. Fas is a cell surface receptor that is activated by binding of Fas ligand or agonistic anti-Fas antibody (29.Itoh N. Yonehara S. Ishii A. Yonehara A. Mizushima S. Sameshima M. Hase A. Seto Y. Nagata S. Cell. 1991; 66: 233-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2663) Google Scholar). Fas receptor interacts with FADD to activate caspase-8 and, subsequently, the effector caspases-3, -7, and -6 (30.Los M. Van de Craen M. Penning L.C. Schenk H. Westendorp M. Baeuerle P.A. Droge W. Krammer P.H. Fiers W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Nature. 1995; 375: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 31.Enari M. Hug H. Nagata S. Nature. 1995; 375: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Unlike TNF-Œ± receptor, Fas is not linked to activation of NFŒ∫B, and therefore is a pure death receptor that lacks antagonistic anti-apoptotic signaling.In LNCaP cells TNF-Œ± induces activation of caspases-8, -6, and -7, appearance of classical DNA fragmentation ladders and 20% cell death within 72 h after treatment. This effect can be blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD. In the presence of TNF-Œ±, irradiation, which has no effect by itself, results in 60‚Äì70% cell death at 72 h after exposure. In the presence of TNF-Œ±, irradiation induces the activation of serine proteases that are inhibited by TLCK and slightly enhances caspase activation (11.Kimura K. Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1606-1614PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, two separate proteolytic pathways are activated in response to the combined treatment of LNCaP cells with TNF-Œ± and irradiation. To further understand the cell death pathways activated by irradiation in sensitized LNCaP cells, we studied the response of LNCaP cells to agonistic Fas antibody combined with Œ≥-irradiation. These experiments were undertaken to compare the effects of Fas activation with those of TNF-Œ± in order to elucidate the mechanism by which resistant cells can become sensitized to radiation-induced apoptosis. We found that Fas activation caused similar sensitization of the cells to irradiation as seen with TNF-Œ±. The cell death pathways induced by the two agonistic receptor/ligand interactions were not entirely redundant and could be combined to produce accelerated cell death when both TNFR-1 and Fas were activated simultaneously.RESULTSTo demonstrate that Fas activation sensitized cells to irradiation we used CH-11, an anti-Fas antibody that cross-links Fas. Fig.1 shows that CH-11-sensitized LNCaP cells to cell death induced by both 8 and 20 Gy Œ≥-irradiation. This was somewhat in contrast to our previously published results with radiation and TNF-Œ± that did not result in more apoptosis at 20 Gy than at 8 Gy (11.Kimura K. Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1606-1614PubMed Google Scholar).Since it was possible that either Fas or TNF-Œ± were sensitizing LNCaP cells to irradiation by increasing expression of each other or other death ligands or receptors, we analyzed the expression of death ligands and receptors during induction of apoptosis by irradiation and Fas or TNFR-1 activation. After exposure to either 8 Gy or TNF-Œ±, Fas expression in LNCaP cells was increased slightly at 6, 24, and 48 h after exposure and combined treatment with TNF-Œ± and irradiation generated slightly more Fas than either treatment alone (Fig.2 A). Since both TNF-Œ± and irradiation increased Fas expression to some degree, it was possible that Fas may have mediated TNF-Œ± sensitization of LNCaP cells to irradiation. To determine the significance of increased Fas expression on the effect of TNF-Œ± we used an anti-Fas neutralizing antibody ZB4. Fig. 2 B shows that Fas neutralizing antibody blocked apoptosis induced by concomitant treatment with radiation and CH-11, but it had no effect on apoptosis induced by either TNF-Œ± or TNF-Œ± plus irradiation.Figure 2Effect of TNF-Œ± and CH-11 on expression of death ligands and receptors. A,Western blots of Fas and Fas ligand at 6, 24, and 48 h after exposure of LNCaP cells to 40 ng/ml TNF-Œ± and/or 20 Gy irradiation. As controls, extracts from LNCaP cells were treated with 100 Œºm etoposide were included. The anti-Fas antibody used for Western blotting detected both unglycosylated Fas lower band and glycosylated Fas upper band. B, LNCaP cells were treated with either 40 ng/ml TNF-Œ± or 4 Œºg/ml CH-11 and/or 20 Gy irradiation in the presence of 10 Œºg/ml neutralizing antibody to Fas receptor (clone ZB4) or a control antibody at the same concentration. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the in situ end labeling assay 72 h after treatment. C,RT-PCR assay of TNF-Œ±, TNF-Œ≤, TRAIL, and DR-3 mRNA expression at 6 and 24 h after treatment of LNCaP cells with 40 ng/ml TNF-Œ± and/or 4 Œºg/ml CH-11 and/or 20 Gy irradiation. As a control we used LNCaP cell treated with 30 nm okadaic acid for 48 h. D, Western blot of TNFRI in extracts of LNCaP cells 24 h after treatment with combinations of 40 ng/ml TNF-Œ±, 4 Œºg/ml CH-11, and 20 Gy irradiation. As a control, LNCaP cells were treated with 30 nm okadaic acid for 48 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We previously showed that TNF-Œ± could induce the expression of its own mRNA (11.Kimura K. Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1606-1614PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether CH-11 was affecting TNF-Œ± expression we analyzed TNF-Œ± mRNA in the cells treated with CH-11. Fig. 2 C shows that anti-Fas antibody did not have any effect on the expression of TNF-Œ± mRNA. Moreover, anti-Fas antibody did not change the amount of mRNA for TNF-Œ≤, TRAIL, or DR3. We also determined levels of TNFR-1 in LNCaP cells treated with TNF-Œ±, CH-11, and irradiation by Western blotting (Fig.2 D). There was no change in the levels of TNFRI in response to these exposures. In Fig. 2, C and D, okadaic acid treatment was included as a positive control since okadaic acid rapidly and efficiently induces caspase-dependent cell death in LNCaP cells. As a result of the experiments shown in Fig. 2 we do not believe that Fas was sensitizing LNCaP cells to irradiation by activating expression of other known death receptors or ligands.Although both CH-11- and TNF-Œ±-sensitized LNCaP cells to irradiation to a similar degree, we found that caspase activation differed between LNCaP cells treated with CH-11 and those treated with TNF-Œ±. Fig.3 A shows Western blots demonstrating activation of different components of the caspase cascade after either TNF-Œ± or CH-11 treatment. As we had previously shown, irradiation enhanced the low level of caspase-8 cleavage induced by TNF-Œ± in LNCaP cells (11.Kimura K. Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1606-1614PubMed Google Scholar). However, at 72 h after treatment there was substantially more caspase-8 cleavage induced by CH-11 than by TNF-Œ± as indicated by the presence of the p28 C-terminal cleavage product in the CH-11-treated cells. Note that both TNF-Œ± and okadaic acid appeared to cause both caspase-8 cleavage and an apparent increase in caspase-8 levels as indicated by the fact that the p55 caspase-8 precursor band was increased in intensity compared with control. The apparent increase in caspase-8 precursor may be similar to the increases in procaspases-3 and -7 that are essential for apoptosis in TSU-Pr1 prostate cancer cells treated with okadaic acid (38.Bowen C. Voeller H.J. Kikly K. Gelmann E.P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Note that procaspase-3 is present at levels undetectable by Western blotting in untreated cells.Figure 3Caspase cleavage in LNCaP cells. A, LNCaP cells were treated with 40 ng/ml TNF-Œ±, 4 Œºg/ml CH-11, or 20 Gy irradiation. Caspase cleavage was determined by Western blotting 72 h after treatment.

Cleavage of DFF was slightly greater in the cells exposed to CH-11 than TNF-Œ±. Note that after exposure to okadaic acid we were able to detect both p18 and p10 terminal cleavage products of DFF45. We only detected a small amount of the 26-kDa partial cleavage product of DFF in LNCaP cells treated with either TNF-Œ± or CH-11. Although irradiation increased apoptosis induced by either TNF-Œ± or CH-11, irradiation had little, if any, effect on the cleavage of DFF caused by either TNF-Œ± or CH-11. This is consistent with the expectation that irradiation, in the presence of a death ligand, activates serine protease-dependent nucleolytic activity in these cells. 2K. Kimura and E. P. Gelmann, unpublished data. Caspase activation is believed to be due predominantly to death ligand activation of the caspase cascade. However, we previously have shown that the serine protease inhibitor, TLCK, had a slight inhibitory effect on caspase activation in LNCaP cells treated with TNF-Œ± and irradiation. This observation was confirmed when we treated the cells with 40 Œºm TLCK, which is known to decrease apoptosis by half. A slight decrease in caspase-8, but not caspase-7 activation was seen (Fig. 3 B).We further investigated the differences in caspase-8 cleavage and activation by TNF-Œ± and CH-11 with Western blotting using antibodies specific for different regions of the caspase-8 molecule (36.Scaffidi C.

In theleft half of Fig.4 A it can be seen that TNF-Œ± alone induced cleavage only of a p43 fragment that corresponded to the procaspase-8 less the C-terminal p10 peptide. There was also an increase in caspase-8 p55 precursor in TNF-Œ±-treated cells and even a greater increase in caspase-8 p55 in cells exposed to TNF-Œ± + irradiation (right half of Fig. 4 A). In contrast, CH-11 activated cleavage of the N-terminal death effector domain-containing prodomains from the C-terminal protease domains as seen by the appearance of p26 detected by N2 antibody and of p28 detected by both C5 and anti-p28 antibody. Irradiation enhanced CH-11-induced cleavage of caspase-8 (compare third andseventh lanes in Fig. 4 A). Although Western blotting with peptide-specific antibodies was consistent with the interpretation of the data shown at the bottom of Fig.4 A, we were not able to detect caspase-8 p10 in any of our samples or positive controls. Because of differences in procaspase-8 cleavage seen with TNF-Œ± and CH-11 treatment, we assayed caspase-8 activity using a fluorescent substrate. Fig. 4 B shows that TNF-Œ± generated active caspase-8, but CH-11 with or without irradiation yielded no detectable caspase-8 activity. Therefore, cleavage of caspase-8 into p26 and p28 fragments was abortive and did not activate caspase activity.Figure 4Caspase-8 cleavage and activity in LNCaP cells. A, LNCaP cells were treated with combinations of 40 ng/ml TNF-Œ±, 1.0 Œºg/ml CH-11, and 20 Gy irradiation. Samples were taken at 48 h after treatment for Western blotting. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies for different fragments of caspase-8 is shown in the diagram at the bottom that is adapted from Scaffidi et al. (36.Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). N2 antibody recognizes the N-terminal domain that contains the death effector domain (DED) regions. C15 and a commercial antibody to p18 recognize the larger protease component. C5 antibody is specific for the C-terminal p10 peptide. Our results with the p18 antibody and C15 were identical and are represented by a blot with C15 antibody. ‚ÄúNS‚Äù in the panel showing the C5 antibody blot means ‚Äúnonspecific.‚Äù B, cleavage of IETD-amc measured fluorimetrically and plotted relative to background fluorescence of untreated cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One of the nucleases activated in these cell death experiments was DFF45 as shown by Western blotting and by DNA cleavage into low molecular weight fragments (not shown). We investigated whether cell death in our experiments also involved serine protease pathways that could lead to the activation of other nucleases. We had observed that apoptosis induced by TNF-Œ± + irradiation could be inhibited completely only by a combination of cysteine and serine protease inhibitors, suggesting that two separate protease cascades were activated by the combined exposure (11.Kimura K. Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1606-1614PubMed Google Scholar). This implied that TNF-Œ± + irradiation activated a separate serine protease pathway that was independent of caspase activation (11.Kimura K. Bowen C. Spiegel S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1606-1614PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that inhibition of apoptosis induced by CH-11 + irradiation could be fully abrogated by zVAD (Fig. 5). Although TLCK inhibited about 50% of the apoptosis induced by CH-11 + irradiation, zVAD blocked both apoptosis induced by CH-11 alone and CH-11 + irradiation. This suggested that serine protease activation after exposure to CH-11 + irradiation contributed to apoptosis, but was dependent on caspase activation. Inhibition of apoptosis induced by CH-11 + irradiation by zVAD implied that caspases played a predominant role in apoptosis induced by CH-11 + irradiation. Since we were able to demonstrate only minimal caspase-6 activation (Fig. 3 A), no caspase-8 activity (Fig. 4 B), and no detectable caspase-3, -7, or -10 cleavage (Fig. 3 A), we hypothesize that some other unidentified caspase activity was responsible for cell death induced by CH-11 + irradiation.Figure 5Inhibition of apoptosis mediated by Fas and irradiation by zVAD and TLCK. LNCaP cells were treated with 4 Œºg/ml CH-11 and/or 20 Gy irradiation in the presence or absence of 50 Œºm zVAD and/or 20 Œºm TLCK, and the fraction of apoptotic cells was determined by the in situ end labeling assay 72 h after treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because there were differences in caspase cleavage and activation between TNF-Œ± and CH-11 treatment of LNCaP cells, we investigated the effect of simultaneous activation of TNFR-1 and Fas. We also assayed the effect of the two ligands together on radiation-induced apoptosis. TNF-Œ± and CH-11 together caused a sensitization to radiation-induced apoptosis and rapid induction of cell death. Even at concentrations that were ineffective when the ligands were used alone, together they activated apoptosis rapidly. In order to show comparisons between treatment with TNF-Œ±, CH-11, and irradiation and treatment with any one or two of these stimuli, we had to measure apoptosis at 24 h, a time when either TNF-Œ± or CH-11 and irradiation were not seen to induce apoptosis (Fig. 6 A). However, combined treatment with TNF-Œ± and CH-11 induced up to 40% cell death at 24 h and up to 90% in the presence of irradiation. In the presence of TNF-Œ± there was a dose-response relationship between the amount of CH-11 added up to 1.0 Œºg/ml and cell death. In the presence of TNF-Œ± and irradiation, all three concentrations of CH-11 used in Fig. 6 A had equivalent effects. Noteworthy was the difference in induction of apoptosis between concentrations of TNF-Œ± ‚â•4 ng/ml and irradiation in the absence and presence of CH-11. We had seen that apoptosis after either TNF-Œ± + irradiation or CH-11 + irradiation was dependent on both caspases and serine proteases. However, in the case of the combination of all three treatments, zVAD completely blocked cell death at 20 and 48 h (not shown), but TLCK had no effect on cell death under these conditions (Fig.6 B).Figure 6Effect of combined TNF-Œ± and CH-11 treatment on LNCaP cells. A, LNCaP cells were treated with various concentrations of TNF-Œ± and/or CH-11. The dose of CH-11 increased within each group of four barsas indicated by the triangles. Within each group the CH-11 doses were 0, 0.4, 1.0, and 4.0 Œºg/ml. Half of the samples were treated concomitantly with 20 Gy irradiation. Twenty-four hours later, the percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the in situ end labeling assay. B, effect of protease inhibitors on apoptosis induced by TNF-Œ± plus CH-11 with or without irradiation. LNCaP cells were treated with different concentrations of TNF-Œ± and CH-11 shown in the figure with or without 20 Gy irradiation. 50 Œºm zVAD and 20 or 50 ŒºmTLCK were used as shown. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined 20 h after treatment by the in situ end labeling assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The radiation sensitization by TNF-Œ± + CH-11 was mediated entirely through the respective cell death receptor interaction with FADD since the expression of a FADD-DN abrogated the sensitization of LNCaP cells by TNF-Œ±, CH-11, or both (Fig. 7). Therefore combined activation of TNFR-1 and Fas in the presence of irradiation resulted in rapid activation of cell death mediated entirely by caspase pathways. Activation of either receptor alone in the presence of irradiation required a longer time period for cell death and the activation of serine as well as cysteine proteases. Since FADD-DN caused near total inhibition of apoptosis induced by TNF-Œ± + irradiation, we concluded that FADD was upstream of both caspase and serine protease activation in LNCaP cells.Figure 7Effect of combined TNF-Œ± and CH-11 treatment on LNCaP cells and FADD-DN transformants. Parental LNCaP cells, vector-transfected LNCaP cells, and LNCaP cells transfected with FADD-DN were treated with 40 ng/ml TNF-Œ± and/or 1 Œºg/ml CH-11 and/or 20 Gy irradiation. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the in situend labeling assay 24 h after treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since FADD-DN blocked sensitization to radiation-induced apoptosis by TNF-Œ± + CH-11, we expected the combined effect of TNF-Œ± and CH-11 to be mediated through caspase activation and therefore expected to see substantial increases in caspas"
https://openalex.org/W2090078699,"S100 proteins became of major interest because of their divergent cell- and tissue-specific expression, their close association with a number of human diseases, and their importance for clinical diagnostics. Here, we report for the first time the purification and characterization of human recombinant S100A13. Flow dialysis revealed that the homodimeric S100A13 binds four Ca2+ in two sets of binding sites, both displaying positive cooperativity but of very different affinity. Fluorescence and difference spectrophotometry indicate that the Trp/Tyr signal changes are almost complete upon binding of Ca2+ to the two high affinity sites, which probably correspond to the C-terminal EF-hands in each subunit. The far-UV circular dichroic signal also changes upon binding of the first two Ca2+. So far, the tissue distribution of S100A13 has not been well characterized. Here, we show that S100A13 is widely expressed in various types of tissues with a high expression level in thyroid gland. Using specific antisera against S100A13, high protein expression was detected in follicle cells of thyroid, Leydig cells of testis, and specific cells of brain. In human smooth muscle cells, which co-express S100A2 in the nucleus and S100A1 in stress fibers, S100A13 shows a unique subcellular localization in the perinuclear area. These data suggest diverse functions for this protein in signal transduction.

In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed calmodulin, the expression of S100 proteins is cell- and tissue-specific. Some are expressed mainly in a few specific tissues, such as S100A3 in human hair cuticle cells (1.Kizawa K. Uchiwa H. Murikami U. Biochim. Biophys.

Other members are detected in a broader range of tissues, such as S100A2 in lung, kidney, liver, cardiac, and skeletal muscle (6.Glenney Jr., J.R. Kindy M.S. Zokas L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 569-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7.Lee S.W. Tomasetto C. Swisshelm K. Keyomarsi K. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bloemers H.P. Cancer Res. 1992; 52 (1261): 1291PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Pedrocchi M. SchaÃàfer B.W. Mueller H. Eppenberger U. Heizmann C.W. Int. J.

S100 proteins show different binding affinities for Ca2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+, yielding new clues to their functional significance in cellular events (11.Heizmann C.W. Cox J.A. Biometals. 1998; 11: 383-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In general, they can bind four Ca2+ per dimer and display rather low affinities, with [Ca2+]0.5 values of 100‚Äì300 Œºm. Some parameters such as high ionic strength can decrease the Ca2+ affinity, e.g. in S100A1 (12.Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and S100A6 (13.Mani R.S. Kay C.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1398-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 14.Pedrocchi M. SchaÃàfer B.W. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Heizmann C.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6732-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, Zn2+ increases the Ca2+ affinity of S100A12 (15.Dell'Angelica E.C. Schleicher C.H. Santome J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and S100B (12.Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and enhances the calcium-dependent association of S100B to target peptides (16.Barber K.R. McClintock K.A. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Dimlich R.V.W. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recently, the Ndr kinase was shown to be a target protein of S100B whereby the interaction is regulated by changes in the intracellular calcium concentration (17.Millward T.A. Heizmann C.W. SchaÃàfer B.W. Hemmings B.A. EMBO. 1998; 17: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Hence, calcium seems to be an important regulator of S100 interactions with target proteins. The cDNA of human and murine S100A13 was first identified by screening expressed sequence tag data bases (18.Wicki R. SchaÃàfer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). 15 genes coding for S100 proteins, including two epidermal differentiation genes with a S100 domain, are arranged in a cluster on human chromosome 1q21 (18.Wicki R. SchaÃàfer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,19.SchaÃàfer B.W. Wicki R. Engelkamp D. Mattei M.G. Heizmann C.W. Genomics. 1995; 25: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The human S100A13 was shown to neighbor S100A1 on chromosome 1q21, at least 35 kilobase pairs apart from the subgroup of the closely linked S100A2-S100A3-S100A4-S100A5-S100A6 genes (18.Wicki R. SchaÃàfer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that the S100 gene cluster also exists in mouse and is structurally conserved during evolution (20.Ridinger K. Ilg E.V. Niggli F.K. Heizmann C.W. SchaÃàfer B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1448: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in contrast to the linkage relationship betweenS100A8 and S100A9 andS100A3-S100A4-S100A5-S100A6, the mouse S100 genesS100A1 and S100A13 are separated in comparison with the human linkage group. Generally, the interspecies homology between the known mouse and human S100 cDNAs ranges from 85 to 95%, whereas mouse S100A13 cDNA shows only 79.6% sequence identity to the human cDNA. According to the hypothesis that S100 genes originated from a primordial gene through duplication, the lower homology of mouse and human S100A13might suggest that the divergence between these two genes occurred earlier in evolution. Expression of S100A13 mRNA has so far been detected in skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, pancreas, ovary, spleen, and small intestine (18.Wicki R. SchaÃàfer B.W. Erne P. Heizmann C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Comparing the protein sequence of human S100A13 with other S100 proteins, we observed interesting differences. The second EF hand contains an unusual lysine in the ‚àíx position which might influence the Ca2+ binding properties. Furthermore, the last 11 C-terminal amino acids contain six lysine and two arginine residues. This positively charged C-terminal region could potentially be involved in specific protein interactions as was reported for the positive C-terminal tail of syntaxin, which interacts with synaptotagmin (21.Shao X. Li C Fernandez I. Zhang X. SuÃàdhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). S100A13 seems to function in exocytosis, since it is one of the targets of two antiallergic drugs, amlexanox and cromolyn (22.Oyama Y. Shishibori T. Yamashita K. Naya T. Nakagiri S., A. Maeta H. Kobayashi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), which inhibit degranulation of mast cells (23.Shishibori T. Oyama Y. Matsushita O. Yamashita K. Furuichi H. Okabe A. Maeta H. Hata Y. Kobayashi R. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Recently, association of S100A13 with the fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF-1)1/p40 synaptotagmin-1 (p40Syn-1) aggregate was shown, and amlexanox is able to repress this release (24.Carreira C.M. LaVallee T.M. Tarantini F. Jackson A. Lathrop J.T. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22224-22231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). FGF-1 is an extracellular mitogenic factor for several cell types, which is secreted e.g. in response to heat shock. These findings suggest that S100A13 might be involved in the regulation of FGF-1 and p40Syn-1 release in response to heat shock. Another possibility might be that S100A13 is secreted together with the FGF-1/p40Syn-1 aggregate. Extracellular activities have also been reported for S100A2, S100A4, S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, S100B, and S100A12. Less is known about the biochemical features and the expression of the S100A13 protein. In order to determine the biochemical characteristics of S100A13, we purified the human recombinant protein for the first time. We then characterized the Ca2+ binding properties by flow dialysis and probed the conformational changes upon binding of cations. We produced and characterized different S100A13 antibodies, which allowed us to demonstrate the expression of S100A13 in specific cells of the thyroid, brain, and testis. Furthermore, we report a particular subcellular localization of S100A13 in human smooth muscle and endothelial cells by confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The expressed sequence tag clone (IMAGET78482) containing the human S100A13 cDNA was supplied by the HGMP Resource Center. The coding region of S100A13 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using specific oligonucleotides containing a 5‚Ä≤ NdeI site (5‚Ä≤-GTCCATATGGCAGAACCACTGA- 3‚Ä≤) and aBamHI site (5‚Ä≤-CTAGGATCCGAAGAGTGCGGTTCTGCT-3‚Ä≤) under the following conditions: 95 ¬∞C for 1 min, 59 ¬∞C for 1 min, 72 ¬∞C for 2 min, 30 cycles, followed by 10 min of 72 ¬∞C extension. The polymerase chain reaction product was cut with the corresponding restriction enzymes and cloned into the pGEMEX vector. The plasmids were sequenced by an ALF DNA sequencer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to verify the open reading frame. A commercially available multitissue Northern blot was used (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and hybridized with [32P]dATP-labeled (Prime-a-gene, Promega, Madison, WI) S100A13 cDNA as described by Sambrook et al. (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The S100A13 pGEMEX construct was transformed into the Bl-21 Lys S strain for expression of the recombinant protein. After the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Œ≤-d-galactopyranoside, the recombinant S100 protein was purified as described by Pedrocchiet al. (14.Pedrocchi M. SchaÃàfer B.W. Durussel I. Cox J.A. Heizmann C.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6732-6738Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with modifications. The flow-through of the phenyl-Sepharose column containing the S100A13 protein was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm Ca2+, pH 7.5, and applied to a MonoQ-1 column. The flow-through was concentrated and loaded onto a 1 √ó 100-cm column of Sephacryl S200 equilibrated in buffer A containing 50 ŒºmCa2+. The sharp peak corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 25‚Äì30 kDa was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 10 Œºm Ca2+, passed over a 1.5 √ó 10-cm column of Q-Sepharose Fast Flow equilibrated in the same buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0‚Äì0.3 mKCl. Homogeneous S100A13 protein eluted in a sharp peak at a gradient conductivity of 10 millimho, corresponding to 80 mmKCl. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were obtained with a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API 365 LC/MS/MS system mass spectrometer equipped with an atmospheric pressure electrospray ion source. Amino acid analysis was performed by gas phase HCl hydrolysis and analyzed by ion exchange chromatography on a Beckman system 6300. Tricine SDS-PAGE (15%) under reducing conditions was performed as described (26.FoÃàhr U.G. Weber B.R. Muntener M. Staudenmann W. Hughes G.J. Frutiger S. Banville D. SchaÃàfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 719-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The proteins were visualized by silver staining as described (27.Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2501) Google Scholar). S100A13 was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, 150 mmKCl (buffer A) and passed over a Sephadex G25 column (0.8 √ó 40 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. The residual Ca2+contamination in the protein fractions, checked by atomic absorption, was always less than 0.05 mol/mol of protein. All the experiments were performed in buffer A starting with this ‚Äúmetal-free‚Äù solution. Total Ca2+, Mg2+, and Zn2+concentrations were determined with a Perkin-Elmer 2380 atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The protein concentration was determined from the ultraviolet absorption spectrum using a molar extinction coefficient, E M, 278 nm, of 16,000m‚àí1 cm‚àí1 for the dimer. 2All of the molar concentrations of S100A13 are calculated for the dimer form. This value was determined by quantitative amino acid analysis on a sample of known optical density and is quite close to the theoretical value of 14,000 based on the content of aromatic residues. Ca2+ binding was measured at 25 ¬∞C by the flow dialysis method (28.Colowick S.P. Womack F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 774-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in buffer A. Protein concentrations were 10‚Äì15 Œºm. Treatment of the raw data and evaluation of the intrinsic metal-binding constants was as described (29.Cox J.A. Celio M.R. Pauls T. Schwaller B. Guidebook to the Calcium-binding Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1996: 1-12Google Scholar). Since the Ca2+ binding isotherms display two sets of different affinities with positive cooperativity in each set, the data were analyzed with the Adair equation for two binding sites, ŒΩ={K1[Ca2+]+2K1K2[Ca2+] 2+‚Ä¶+4K1K2K3K4[Ca2+] 4}/{1+K1[Ca2+]+K1K2[Ca2+] 2+‚Ä¶+K1K2K3K4[Ca2+] 4}Equation 1 where K 1, K 2,K 3, and K 4 are the stoichiometric association constants for the binding of the successive Ca2+ ions to the protein dimer. CD spectra were acquired with a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter at 25 ¬∞C on solutions of 0.25 mg/ml protein in buffer A in a cell of 1-mm optical path. Ellipticities were normalized for the residue concentration using the relationship Œ∏ MRW =Œ∏ o M r/lc, where Œ∏ o is the observed ellipticity in millidegrees, M r is the average molecular weight of an amino acid in the polypeptide (116.8 for S100A5), l is the path length in mm, and c is the protein concentration in mg/ml. Emission fluorescence spectra were taken with a Perkin-Elmer LS-5B spectrofluorimeter on 2 Œºm metal-free protein in buffer A at 25 ¬∞C with excitation at 278 nm and slits of 5 and 10 nm. 20 Œºm EGTA or 2 mmMg2+, 2 mm Ca2+, 0.15 mm Zn2+, or 4 m guanidine-HCl was added to monitor the effect of the respective ions or to obtain the spectrum of the denatured protein. UV spectra and difference spectra were measured with a Perkin-Elmer Œª5 spectrophotometer at room temperature. To the metal-free protein solution (55 Œºm) in buffer A, 2 mmCa2+, 0.15 mm Zn2+, or 4m guanidine-HCl was added. Difference spectra were normalized to an optical density of 1.0 at 278 nm. Changes in the fluorescence properties of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS) were monitored by fluorimetry as described (30.FoÃàhr U.G. Heizmann C.W. Engelkamp B.W. SchaÃàfer B.W. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21056-21061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). After incubation of 2 Œºm protein in buffer A containing either 20 Œºm EGTA, 2 mm Ca2+, 2 mm Mg2+, 0.15 mm Zn2+, or 0.1 mm Cu2+ with 40 Œºm TNS for 5 min, the solutions were excited at 328 nm, and the emission spectra were recorded at 25 ¬∞C with 5-nm slits. In control experiments, it was established that the metal ions do not directly affect the TNS fluorescence. Antisera against human recombinant S100A13 were produced in two rabbits (2505 and 2506). Animals were immunized five times at 3-week intervals by injection of initially 500 Œºg of protein, followed by 250 Œºg of protein for further boosts in an emulsion with Hunter's Titer Max (Cyt RX, Norcross, GA). The titers of the antisera were determined using 1 Œºg of recombinant protein on Western blots as described by Ilg et al. (8.Ilg E.C. SchaÃàfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). A dilution of maximally 1:50,000 (antisera 2505/2506) is possible for the detection of 1 Œºg of recombinant protein. Total cell extracts were prepared as described previously (8.Ilg E.C. SchaÃàfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After separation with Tricine SDS-PAGE, the proteins were blotted at 50 V for 1 h onto 0.2-Œºm nitrocellulose (Schleicher and Schuell, Germany) and cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation (480 mJ). Protein transfer was detected by Ponceau S staining. The membrane was blocked overnight in TBST (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween) containing 3% milk powder and incubated for 1 h with S100A13 antiserum (antiserum 2505; 1:500). After washing the membrane three times in TBST, the blot was incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG Peroxidase (Sigma; 1:50,000). The bands were detected using ECL solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Kodak films for 5‚Äì30 min. The two human smooth muscle cell lines HISMC and HA-VSMC were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), and the endothelial cell line ECV was a gift from Dr. T. Maciag (South Portland, Maine). HISMC cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal calf serum, and HVSMC in Ham's F-12K medium with 2 mml-glutamine adjusted to 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate and supplemented with 10 mm Hepes, 10 mm TES, 50 Œºg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 Œºg/ml insulin, 10 Œºg/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml sodium selenite, 10 Œºg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, and 10% fetal calf serum. The ECV cell line was cultivated in M199 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For immunofluorescence staining, the different cell lines were transferred into 24-well plates. The stainings were performed as described (8.Ilg E.C. SchaÃàfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The polyclonal serum (rabbit 2505) and the preimmune serum were diluted at 1:100. S100A2 was stained with the polyclonal rabbit antiserum F4023 (1:100) and S100A1 with the polyclonal rabbit serum F3792 (1:100). The secondary Cy3-conjugated affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) antibody was used (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Baltimore, MD) at a dilution of 1:200. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides and embedded in Mowiol (Hoechst, Frankfurt). A Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a confocal scanning unit MRC-600 (Bio-Rad, UK) and an argon-krypton laser was used to examine the cells. Subsequently, images were processed using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). Multitissue slides containing different human tissue sections (Biomeda, Foster City, CA) were stained as described (8.Ilg E.C. SchaÃàfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 68: 325-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The antiserum against S100A13 was diluted 1:200. In order to study the biochemical properties and to produce antibodies, we purified recombinant S100A13 protein. To this end, the S100A13 cDNA was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEMEX and transformed into Escherichia coli cells. The protein was expressed by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-Œ≤-d-galactopyranoside, and extracts were prepared before and after induction. On a SDS gel, a 10-kDa band was evident with and without the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-Œ≤-d-galactopyranoside (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and 2), indicating that some S100A13 is also expressed in the noninduced state. The overexpressed S100A13 corresponds to about 5% of the total bacterial protein content, and about 5 mg of protein could be expressed in a 250-ml bacteria culture. Typically, S100 proteins can be purified through hydrophobic interaction with a phenyl-Sepharose matrix. However, S100A13 behaved differently from all other S100 proteins, since it was not retained on the column. The flow-through was applied on a MonoQ-1 column, which retained nearly all of the contaminating proteins, whereas S100A13 appeared again in the flow-through. The protein was over 95% pure by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) although with an atypical UV spectrum (maximum at 260 nm). Therefore, it was further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl S200 followed by ion exchange on QS fast-flow, essentially to remove nonprotein UV-absorbing material. After this additional chromatographic step, the protein was homogeneous in SDS-PAGE and displayed, in the metal-free as well as in the denatured form, a near-UV spectrum, which is consistent with the presence of one Trp and one Tyr (Fig. 4, left inset).Figure 4Difference spectra of 55 Œºm S100A13 dimer in buffer A at room temperature after the addition of 2 mm Ca2+(solid line), 0.15 mmZn2+ (dashed line), or 4 m guanidine HCl (dashed and dotted line) to the metal-free protein. The difference optical density (DOD) was expressed for a protein solution with an optical density of 1.0 at 280 nm.

The molecular mass of 11343 Da (data not shown) is in good agreement with the theoretically calculated molecular mass without the first methionine (11341.1 Da). We therefore conclude that the first methionine is cleaved off during expression. The native molecular mass of S100A13, determined by Sephacryl S200 gel filtration in buffer A containing either 2 mm Ca2+ or 1 mm EGTA, amounts to 27 kDa, strongly suggesting that the protein is a homodimer as was reported for most other members of this family. Ca2+ binding by flow dialysis under physiological ionic strength conditions (Fig.2) revealed that each dimer binds four Ca2+ with two different affinities: two with a [Ca2+]0.5 of 8 Œºm and two with a [Ca2+]0.5 of 400 Œºm. However, within each set there is positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient, n H, of 1.33, apparently as a result of allostery between the subunits. The analysis with the Adair equation (Equation 1) yielded the stoichiometric binding constants 1.25 √ó 105m‚àí1 forK 1 and K 2, and 2.5 √ó 103m‚àí1 forK 3 and K 4. The far-UV CD spectra shown in Fig. 3 are atypical, since the minimum at 222 nm found in most other Œ±-helix-rich proteins, including the other S100 proteins (31.Franz C. Durussel I. Cox J.A. SchaÃàfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18826-18834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), is shifted to 228 nm, perhaps as a result of particular contributions of the tandem Trp-Tyr at the end of the second Ca2+-binding loop. A quantitative analysis of the metal-free form according to Johnson (32.Johnson W.J. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) yielded the following estimates of secondary structure: 49% Œ±-helix, 9% 310-helix, 2% Œ≤-pleated sheet, 9% Œ≤-turn, 7% Pro-type helix, and 24% ‚Äúothers.‚Äù The addition of 100 Œºm Ca2+, which saturates only the high affinity sites, leads to an increase of the ellipticity, especially at 238 nm (see difference spectrum of Fig. 3) and an increase of Œ±-helix content of 5%. The addition of 0.15 mm Zn2+ or 2 mm Mg2+ to the metal-free sample had no effect (not shown). The addition of 2 mm Ca2+in order to saturate the low affinity sites leads to an additional very small change. It can thus be concluded that, contrary to S100A2 (31.Franz C. Durussel I. Cox J.A. SchaÃàfer B.W. Heizmann C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18826-18834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), S100P (33.Gribenko A. Lopez M.M. Richardson J.M. Makhatadze G.I. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), or S100A5, 3B. W. SchaÃàfer, unpublished results. the Œ±-helix content increases upon binding of Ca2+. S100A13 contains only one Tyr76 and one Trp77 at the end of the Ca2+-binding loop in the second EF-hand. The emission fluorescence spectrum of the metal-free protein has a maximum at 332 nm, and its intensity is 1.3-fold higher than that of the denatured protein. Contrary to the case for nearly all of the other S100 proteins, Ca2+ binding to S100A13 leads to a 1.3-fold decrease together with a slight red shift. Thus, the Ca2+form differs from the denatured one only by its 12-nm blue shift. The addition of 2 mm Mg2+ or 0.15 mmZn2+ to the metal-free protein has nearly no effect, pointing to the Ca2+-specific character of the sites. The near-UV spectrum (Fig. 4, left inset) shows a maximum at 280 nm with a shoulder at 290 nm, typical for a protein containing Trp. The near-UV difference spectrum induced by Ca2+ binding shows positive and negative peaks in the 270‚Äì310-nm region, quite similar to those of calretinin and calretinin-22k (34.Schwaller B. Durussel I. Jermann D. Herrmann B. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29663-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and indicative of rearrangements in the environment of the single Trp. Qualitatively, 0.15 mm Zn2+has the same effects as Ca2+, except that the intensities of the peaks are 2.5-fold less (dashed line in Fig. 4). Cu2+ (0.1 mm) has a similar effect as Zn2+, except that the base line continuously rises at lower wavelengths (data not shown). Interestingly, Ca2+ binding and denaturation by guanidine-HCl produce quite similar spectral changes, supporting the fluorescence data. The Ca2+titration of 55 Œºm S100A13 (Fig. 4, right inset) shows a linear dependence of the optical signal change on the added Ca2+ concentration with a clear inflection point at a ratio of 2.15 Ca2+/mol of dimeric protein. Thus, conformational changes are completed after binding of one Ca2+ to the high affinity site. TNS becomes fluorescent when associated noncovalently to hydrophobic regions in proteins. The emission fluorescence of TNS alone is very weak; metal-free recombinant S100A13 induces a 17-fold enhancement, whereas only a slight enhancement occurs with the Ca2+-loaded form (Fig.5). These data suggest that, contrary to nearly all of the documented cases of the other S100 proteins, Ca2+ binding does not lead to the exposure of a hydrophobic patch at the surface of S100A13, and they explain why S100A13 does not bind to phenyl-Sepharose. Zn2+ and Cu2+ have no pronounced effect on the apo form and no effect at all on the Ca2+-saturated protein. To study the expression pattern and localization of S100A13 in different human tissues and cell lines, we raised polyclonal antisera against the recombinant protein. Antisera were first tested for their cross-reactivity against other S100 proteins on Western blots (Fig. 1 B). The polyclonal antibody 2505 recognized specifically the corresponding antigen"

Because of their potential involvement in other degenerative disorders, we have examined the expression of transglutaminases (TGases) in normal and SIBM tissues. We report that at least two different enzymes, the ubiquitous TGase 2 as well as the TGase 1 enzyme, are present in muscle tissues. However, in comparison with normal tissue, the expression of TGases 1 and 2 was increased 2.5- and 4-fold in SIBM, accompanied by about a 20-fold higher total TGase activity. By immunohistochemical staining, in normal muscle, TGase 2 expression was restricted to some endomysial connective tissue elements, whereas TGase 1 and Œ≤-amyloid proteins were not detectable. In SIBM muscle, both TGases 1 and 2 as well as amyloid proteins were brightly expressed and co-localized in the vacuolated muscle fibers, but none of these proteins colocalized with inflammatory cell markers. Next, we isolated high molecular weight insoluble proteins from SIBM muscle tissue and showed that they were cross-linked by about 6 residues/1000 residues of the isopeptide bond. Furthermore, by amino acid sequencing of solubilized tryptic peptides, they contain amyloid and skeletal muscle proteins. Together, these findings suggest that elevated expression of TGases 1 and 2 participate in the formation of insoluble amyloid deposits in SIBM tissue and in this way may contribute to progressive and debilitating muscle disease.

Brummett A. Browder L.W. Developmental Biology. 1. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1985: 235-288Google Scholar). Upon fertilization, the sperm attaches directly to the egg plasma membrane through the micropyle, a single, small pore in the chorion. Following sperm-egg fusion, cortical alveoli located in the egg cortical cytoplasm fuse with the plasma membrane from the inside and discharge their contents into the perivitelline space. The chorion subsequently transforms from fragile into rigid structure via morphological and biochemical changes (2.Nakano E.

Embryonic development then begins under the protection of the hardened chorion. These changes at fertilization correspond to the formation of fertilization membranes in sea urchin (9.Kay E.S.

In medaka, ZI-1,2 and ZI-3 were shown to be the major chorion proteins. After limited hydrolysis to produce 61- and 62-kDa proteins early in the process of chorion hardening, ZI-1,2 polymerizes with ZI-3 to form insoluble higher molecular weight complexes (13.Masuda K.

The transglutaminase is located within the unfertilized egg chorion (22.Iuchi I. Ha C.-R. Masuda K. Fish. Biol. J. MEDAKA. 1995; 7: 15-20Google Scholar, 23.Ha C.-R. Iuchi I. Comp. Biochem.

However, the molecular mechanism initiating of chorion hardening remains largely unknown. In the previous studies, exocytosis of cortical alveoli related to the chorion hardening was described (3.Yamamoto T. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1961; 12: 361-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 24.Ohtsuka E. Sieboldia. 1957; 2: 19-29Google Scholar, 25.Yamamoto T.S. Jpn. J.

After developing a method for collecting exudate from cortical alveoli of medaka eggs, we showed that chorion hardening could be induced in vitro by the exudate (14.Iwamatsu T. Shibata Y. Kanie T. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1995; 37: 747-759Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found that ZI-1,2 proteins of heat-denatured chorion were hydrolyzed but not polymerized by the exudate (28.Shibata Y. Iwamatsu T. Zool. Sci. 1996; 13: 271-275Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This system is useful to analyze an early step of the chorion hardening. In the present study, we characterize an enzyme, alveolin, from cortical alveoli exudate that induces chorion hardening in vitro. The function of alveolin in chorion hardening is discussed. Medaka (Oryzias latipes, orange-red type) were maintained in laboratory aquaria under controlled conditions (29.Iwamatsu T. Onitake K. Yoshimoto Y. Hiramoto Y. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1991; 33: 479-490Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Medaka spawned daily within 1 h of the onset of light. Unfertilized eggs were removed from the ovarian lumen within 2 h after ovulation and kept in medaka saline (111.2 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.1 mm CaCl2, 0.6 mmMgSO4, pH 7.3, adjusted with NaHCO3) (30.Iwamatsu T. Ohta T. Nakashima S. Shoji H. Annot. Zool. Jpn. 1976; 49: 28-37Google Scholar). Chorions were partially cut at the vegetal pole, and intact eggs were squeezed out as described previously (31.Iwamatsu T. J. Exp. Zool. 1983; 228: 83-89Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Naked eggs were transferred into the small amounts of the medaka saline and activated by pricking to induce exocytosis of cortical alveoli. After the completion of exocytosis the extra egg solution was used as egg exudate. The exudate was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at ‚àí80 ¬∞C until use. Remaining chorions were washed and kept in ice-cold Ca2+-free saline (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Hardened chorions become insoluble in 2% SDS or 8m urea. Therefore, the progress of chorion hardening is easily analyzed as decreased proteinaceous bands by SDS-PAGE1 (13.Masuda K. Iuchi I. Yamagami K. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1991; 33: 75-83Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14.Iwamatsu T. Shibata Y. Kanie T. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1995; 37: 747-759Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Three isolated chorions were incubated in 25 Œºl of medaka saline containing exudate or chromatography fractions for 2 h at 25 ¬∞C. After incubation, the chorions were dissolved in 60 Œºl of extraction medium (5 m urea, 1.5 m thiourea, 0.5% 2-mercaptoethanol) by heating for 1 h at 60 ¬∞C and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% gel. SDS-PAGE was done according to the method of Laemmli (32.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Heat treatment of chorions suppresses hyper-cross-linking of chorion proteins allowing analysis of early proteolysis of chorion proteins. Isolated chorions were heated at 60 ¬∞C for 1 h in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). The heat-denatured chorions were then incubated with the exudate or chromatography fractions for 2 h at 25 ¬∞C. Incubations were stopped by washing with buffer A containing 5 mm EDTA and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on a 12.5% gel. The density of ZI-1,2, 61‚Äì62-kDa, and ZI-3 bands was estimated by ImageMaster 1D software (version 2, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The ratio of the density of the 61‚Äì62-kDa band to the ZI-3 band (61‚Äì62 kDa/ZI-3) was employed as an index of proteinase activity. All purification procedures were performed at 4‚Äì10 ¬∞C. Exudate (3.6 ml) from 3,000 naked eggs was mixed with one-ninth the volume of buffered solution (250 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8.0) and applied to a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow anion exchange column (1 ml) equilibrated with buffer A solution. The column was washed with 3 ml of buffer A. A 7-ml fraction was collected, mixed with an equal volume of 25 mmTris-HCl, 3.4 m ammonium sulfate, pH 8.0, and centrifuged at 5,000 √ó g for 60 min. Supernatant was then applied to a Phenyl-Superose HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1.7 mammonium sulfate, pH 8.0. After washing, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 1.7 to 0 m ammonium sulfate. Active fractions were applied to a Superdex 75 column (3.2 √ó 300 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 m NaCl, pH 8.0). Chorion protein-cleaving activity and chorion hardening-inducing activity were determined after each purification step. Protein was measured by using BCA reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Purified enzyme (2 Œºg) was separated by SDS-PAGE, and protein bands were stained with 40% methanol and 1% acetic acid containing 0.5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Stained bands were excised from the gel and incubated with sequence grade modified trypsin (Promega) at 37 ¬∞C for 17 h. The released tryptic peptides were separated by the SMART system using a ŒºRPC C2/C18 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and sequenced with an automatic sequencer (model 477A, Applied Biosystems). Cysteine residues were pyridylethylated with 4-vinylpyridine for the analysis of amino acid sequence. An aliquot of the purified enzyme (0.4 Œºg) was also used for determination of the N-terminal amino acid sequence. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers for reverse transcription-PCR were designed from the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. The forward primer, 5‚Ä≤-GC(ATCG)CA(AG)GG(ATCG)GT(ATCG)AT(ATC)CC-3‚Ä≤, corresponded to the amino acid sequence AQGVIP derived from N-terminal sequencing. The reverse primer, 5‚Ä≤-CC(AG)AA(AG)TC(AG)TA(ATGC)GG(ATGC)A(AG)(AG)TT-3‚Ä≤, corresponded to the internal amino acid sequence NLPYDFG. Amplification was performed using AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer) with medaka ovarian cDNA library as a template. A medaka ovarian cDNA library was prepared from poly(A)-enriched RNA by unidirectional insertion of cDNA into ŒªZAPII (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Conditions for PCR were 1 min at 94 ¬∞C, followed by 30 cycles of 94 ¬∞C for 1 min, 49 ¬∞C for 1 min, and 72 ¬∞C for 1 min. PCR products were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced using dye terminator reactions with an automated ABI 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). 1.5 √ó 104 plaques of medaka ovarian cDNA library were screened for alveolin cDNA. The cDNA probes for plaque hybridization were synthesized with PCR DIG labeling mix (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) using two primers derived from a partial alveolin cDNA sequence (SPF, 5‚Ä≤-CACCATCAGCATGGAGCTG-3‚Ä≤ (nucleotides 282‚Äì300) and SPR, 5‚Ä≤-AGGGTGTGTCCCATTTTCACATC-3‚Ä≤ (nucleotides 607‚Äì630)). pBluescript plasmids carrying the cDNA were excised from seven positive plaques. Inserts of the plasmids were sequenced as described above using T3, T7, and custom primers. The 5‚Ä≤-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using a Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intact chorions contain two major proteins, ZI-1,2 and ZI-3 with molecular masses of 73‚Äì77 and 49 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1, lane 1). Chorions incubated with exudate for 2 h became rigid and insoluble. Hardened chorions were not soluble in the extraction medium (Fig. 1, lane 2). During chorion hardening, ZI-1,2 were proteolyzed resulting in molecular mass changes from 73‚Äì77 to 61‚Äì62 kDa, respectively. Heat treatment of the chorion prevented the hardening process from further cross-linking resulting in only 61‚Äì62-kDa intermediate proteins on the gel (Fig. 1, lane 3). In short, the exudate contained both activities as a chorion hardening-inducing factor and a ZI-1,2-specific proteinase. Therefore, we employed two assay systems for each purification step. Proteolytic activity was co-purified with the chorion hardening-inducing activity as a single peak throughout all chromatography steps. The last peak on Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography contained both activities and resulted in a single band on SDS-PAGE with a molecular mass of 23.5 kDa (Fig. 2). The purification of alveolin is summarized in Table I.Figure 2A, the elution profile of alveolin from a Superdex 75 column. Fractions of 50 Œºl were collected at flow rate of 50 Œºl/min.

Isolated chorions were incubated in medaka saline for 2 h at 25 ¬∞C with (lane 2) or without (lane 1) 10 Œºg/ml alveolin. In lane 3, chorions were heat-denatured for 30 min at 60 ¬∞C and then incubated with alveolin. Aliquots (10 Œºl) of the extracts were run on 12.5% gel, and proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The arrowheads on theright indicate intermediate proteins with molecular masses of 61‚Äì62 kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISummary of purification of alveolin from medaka egg exudateStepTotal proteinTotal activityaTotal activity was calculated with values estimated by densitometry after each purification step.

Chelating reagents such as EDTA, EGTA, ando-phenanthroline strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity. Inhibitors of serine, cysteine, and aspartic proteinases were ineffective. Phosphoramidon showed a weak inhibition. The activity lost by EDTA treatment was restored by the addition of divalent metal ions.

Open table in a new tab Amino acid sequences obtained from purified alveolin are shown with underlines in Fig. 4. Eight internal sequences were determined. 14 amino acids of the N terminus were also determined. By using oligonucleotide primers designed against these sequences, a single PCR product of 360 base pairs was obtained. By using the digoxigenin-labeled PCR product as a probe, putative full-length cDNA clones were isolated from a medaka ovary cDNA library. Seven positive clones were obtained from 1.5 √ó 104plaques and sequenced. These seven clones were essentially identical with slight differences in length at the 5‚Ä≤-ends. 5‚Ä≤-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends method was used to determine potential translation initiation points. The nucleotide sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 4. The nucleotide sequence of 876 bp contains a short 5‚Ä≤-region, a putative single open reading frame of 795 bp encoding a protein of 265 amino acids, and a 3‚Ä≤-untranslated region of 75 bp containing a polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA) and a poly(A) tail. All eight peptide sequences obtained from the purified alveolin were found in the open reading frame. The putative cleavage site of the signal peptide was found at position 18 using SignalP (Center for Biological Sequence Analysis, the Technical University of Denmark). The N-terminal amino acid sequence determined from purified alveolin was found to start at position 79. This indicates alveolin has a pro-sequence that has been cleaved in the secreted form. The calculated molecular mass of the mature protein is 21.5 kDa. The amino acid sequence of alveolin showed significant homology with the astacin metalloproteinase family. The amino acid sequence of alveolin showed 27.9, 27.5, 27.2, 23.8, and 25.1% identity with HCE1, HCE2, LCE (medaka hatching enzymes; Ref. 33.Yasumasu S. Yamada K. Akasaka K. Mitsunaga K. Iuchi I.

Sequence comparison of alveolin with other astacin family members revealed that alveolin contained the highly conserved zinc-binding motif, HEXXHXXGFXHEXXRXDRD with a single substitution of methionine for phenylalanine (Fig.5). This motif characterizes the active site of astacin family metalloproteinases (36.Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4 (1261): 1427Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The glutamate residue in this motif is indispensable for the catalytic activity of the enzyme (37.StoÃàcker W. Grams F. Boumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-RuÃàth F.X. Mckay D.B. Bode W.

In addition, alveolin contained the Met turn motif SXMHY that is essential for the structural integrity of the zinc-binding site (37.StoÃàcker W. Grams F. Boumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-RuÃàth F.X.

To our knowledge, this is the first description of the isolation and identification of chorion hardening-inducing activity from the exudate of cortical alveoli of teleost eggs. It is a single protein with a molecular mass of 21.5 kDa and transforms the chorion into a hard and insoluble structure in vitro. As this protein was isolated from the exudate of cortical alveoli, we named this protein ‚Äúalveolin.‚Äù Based on the amino acid sequences from purified alveolin, we cloned alveolin cDNA from a medaka ovarian cDNA library. Sequence analysis demonstrated that alveolin was a member of the astacin metalloproteinase family. Alveolin cDNA encoded a possible signal peptide, a pro-domain, and a proteinase domain, common features for astacin proteinase family (36.Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4 (1261): 1427Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Alveolin cDNA also contained a zinc-binding motif and a methionine turn motif in the proteinase domain that characterizes the astacin proteinase family (36.Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4 (1261): 1427Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). All of the enzymatic properties of alveolin examined in this study corresponded well with the features of astacin metalloproteinase family (Fig. 3 and Tables II and III). The optimal ranges of pH and temperature for the enzymatic activity agreed with the natural conditions for medaka fertilization (40.Iwamatsu T. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1984; 26: 533-544Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In the present study, the ZI-1,2-processing proteinase activity was co-purified with the chorion hardening-inducing activity throughout all purification steps. The purified alveolin retained both activities. These results indicate that alveolin initiates chorion hardening by hydrolyzing ZI-1,2 to 61‚Äì62-kDa intermediates, which are then cross-linked with ZI-3 by transglutaminase within the chorion itself. We have identified the specific amino acid residues for cross-linking the 61‚Äì62-kDa intermediate with ZI-3 into a 132-kDa intermediate (14.Iwamatsu T. Shibata Y. Kanie T. Dev. Growth & Differ. 1995; 37: 747-759Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) by a single isopeptide bond. 2Y. Shibata, T. Iwamatsu, Y. Oba, D. Kobayashi, M. Tanaka, Y. Nagahama, N. Suzuki, and M. Yoshikuni, unpublished data. This 132-kDa intermediate may be further polymerized by transglutaminase to form an insoluble compound. However, the detailed mechanism of the polymerization is still unclear. In other animals, proteases are also shown to play important roles upon fertilization. These data have been mainly focused in relation to sperm-egg binding, inducing acrosome reaction, and slow block of polyspermy with enzymatic modifications of egg surface proteins (41.Vacquier V.D. Tegner M.J. Epel D. Exp. Cell Res. 1973; 80: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 42.Bleil J.D. Wassarman P.M.

Thomsen G.H. Lennarz W. Dev. Biol. 1997; 187: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Xenopus, chymotrypsin-like protease is also shown to proteolyze partially egg membrane glycoproteins at fertilization to increase the toughness of the egg membrane to heat, proteases, and reducing agents (45.Lindsay L.L. Hedrick J.J. Dev. Biol. 1989; 135: 202-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, biochemical details of the mechanisms are still not clear as medaka alveolin shown in the present study. Medaka hatching enzymes, HCE1, HCE2, and LCE, are secreted from the hatching gland and hydrolyze the hardened chorions at the time of hatching (46.Yasumasu S. Iuchi I. Yamagami K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 47.Yasumasu S. Iuchi I. Yamagami K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1989; 105: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These proteins are also members of the astacin proteinase family (33.Yasumasu S. Yamada K. Akasaka K. Mitsunaga K. Iuchi I. Shimada H. Yamagami K. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Hatching enzymes hydrolyze unfertilized egg chorions but do not induce hardening. In contrast, alveolin partially hydrolyzes unfertilized egg chorions to induce chorion hardening but does not degrade fertilized egg chorions. Interestingly, members of the astacin proteinase family play roles at opposite phases of destruction and reconstruction of chorion membranes, suggesting unique regulatory mechanisms of substrate recognition. There is a single amino acid substitution of methionine for phenylalanine in the zinc-binding motif of the alveolin sequence. All other astacin members have a conserved phenylalanine residue in the motif except flavastacin (48.Tarentino A.L. Quinones G. Grimwood B.G. Hauer C.R. Plummer Jr., T.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), identified in Flavobacterium meningosepticum, which also has a single substitution. Although the effect of this substitution on the structure and function of the zinc-binding motif is unclear, it may relate to the functional differences between medaka hatching enzymes and alveolin. Astacin family members are all secretory proteinases that are synthesized as proenzymes (36.Bond J.S. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4 (1261): 1427Crossref Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Alveolin has a pro-sequence of 60 amino acids as determined by cDNA sequence analysis. Medaka hatching enzymes retain the pro-sequence in the hatching gland but lose them at the time of secretion (49.Yasumasu S. Katow S. Hamazaki T.S. Iuchi I. Yamagami K. Dev. Biol. 1992; 149: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Alveolin purified from exudate had already lost the pro-sequence domain. Although the mechanisms of pro-sequence processing of hatching enzymes and alveolin are still unclear, similar mechanisms may regulate processing of both enzymes. With respect to the progress of chorion hardening, the 132-kDa intermediates may further cross-link to form highly complex structures via transglutaminase activity. However, further analysis of the molecular mechanisms regulating the cross-linking of chorion proteins and transglutaminase activation following alveolin release is required. We thank Yumiko Makino (National Institute for Basic Biology, Center for Analytical Instruments) for analyzing alveolin amino acid sequence and Dr. Craig E. Morrey for critical reading of the manuscript."

Various lines of evidence indicate that p24 proteins fall into four subfamilies (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, and Œ¥) and that tetramers are assembled containing one representative from each subfamily; however, the nature of the protein-protein interactions within these hetero-oligomers is unknown. We have identified a lumenal segment of yeast p24Œ≤ (Emp24p) that is necessary for its assembly into p24 complexes. Replacement of 52 C-terminal residues of Emp24p with the corresponding sequence from Erv25p (p24Œ¥) generates a chimeric protein able to replace Emp24p in p24 complexes that retain partial function in vivo, ruling out a role for the transmembrane and cytosolic domains in specifying p24 interactions. Substitution of a further 50 residues, encompassing a heptad repeat region, abolishes the ability of the chimera to replace Emp24p but instead creates a protein that resembles its Erv25p parent in its requirement for stabilization by Emp24p.

With the completion of the sequence of the S. cerevisiae genome, it has emerged that in yeast there is a total of eight genes that encode p24s (4.Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Solari R.C.E. Rowley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The p24 proteins are type 1 transmembrane proteins of about 25 kDa that have a C-terminal transmembrane domain and a short cytosolic tail, typically 12‚Äì15 residues, containing sequence motifs known to specify interactions with vesicle coat proteins. The N-terminal lumenal domain of the proteins includes two conserved cysteine residues and, in the membrane proximal part of the domain, a region that includes a set of heptad repeats suggestive of a capability to participate in coiled-coil interactions. Some of the first studies of p24 function (2.Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S. Kruger U. Barlowe C. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 5.Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) were taken to point to a role in selecting cargo molecules for packaging into COPII-coated vesicles leaving the ER (6.Kaiser C. Ferro-Novick S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Although recent evidence indicates that the COPII proteins can form vesicles from liposomes without any involvement of integral membrane proteins (7.Matsuoka K. Orci L. Amherdt M. Bednarek S.Y. Hamamoto S. Schekman R. Yeung T. Cell. 1998; 93: 263-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), the formation of vesicles in vivo appears to be linked to a cargo selection process (8.Aridor M.

In yeast cells, the finding that p24 defects cause slowed kinetics of secretion of a subset of cargo proteins (2.Schimmoller F. Singer-Kruger B. Schroder S. Kruger U. Barlowe C. Riezman H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1329-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 5.Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) led to the suggestion that p24 proteins might act as cargo receptors, the function of which is to ensure the concentration of cargo into COPII-coated vesicles. Consistent with this idea are the findings that p24 proteins are packaged into COPII vesicles (5.Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and that p24 defects allow the bypass of the requirement for one component of the COPII coat, Sec13p (12.Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), which could reflect the existence of a regulatory mechanism linking cargo recruitment with the completion of COPII coat assembly. Although associations involving COPII components, p24 molecules, and cargo have been reported (13.Kuehn M.J. Herrmann J.M. Schekman R. Nature. 1998; 391: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), direct evidence for a cargo selection role involving interactions between p24 molecules and specific cargo molecules has not yet emerged. Other evidence points to a role for the p24s in COPI-mediated retrograde vesicle traffic from the Golgi to the ER. The proteins contain COPI binding motifs in their cytosolic tails that have been shown to function in vivo and in vitro (14.Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 15.Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nilsson T. J.

Cell. 1999; 96: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Studies of the localization of the proteins in mammalian cells indicate that they cycle between the ER and Golgi but are to be found predominantly in the Golgi (15.Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 17.Nickel W. Sohn K. Bunning C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11393-11398Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A role for the proteins in retrograde traffic would explain the finding that, in yeast, p24 defects cause elevated secretion of the ER protein Kar2p (12.Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), normally retrieved from the Golgi via retrograde trafficking of the Erd2 receptor (18.Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, this phenotype could also stem from a loss of cargo control at the ER: previous studies indicate that the Erd2p-mediated retrieval mechanism is easily saturated in yeast (19.Munro S. Pelham H.R.B. Cell. 1987; 48: 899-907Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1571) Google Scholar), so any increased flow of proteins, such as Kar2p, out of the ER would be expected to lead to a significant overspill into the secretory pathway. On the basis of sequence comparisons, p24s can be divided into four subfamilies, p24Œ±, p24Œ≤, p24Œ≥, and p24Œ¥ (4.Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Solari R.C.E. Rowley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15.Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the view that p24s from each of these subfamilies are assembled into hetero-oligomeric complexes. The observation that two yeast p24s, Emp24p and Erv25p, are interdependent for stability (5.Belden W.J. Barlowe C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26939-26946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that the proteins might interact in a complex, and this work has been extended by Marzioch et al. (4.Marzioch M. Henthorn D.C. Herrmann J.M. Wilson R. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Solari R.C.E. Rowley A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1923-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), who have concluded from the results of immunoprecipitation experiments that four yeast p24s (Erp1p (p24Œ±), Emp24p (p24Œ≤), Erp2p (p24Œ≥), and Erv25p (p24Œ¥)) function together in a heteromeric complex. Furthermore, mammalian cells seem to contain heteromeric p24 complexes of similar composition: immunoprecipitation and coexpression studies (20.Fullekrug J. Suganuma T. Tang B.L. Hong W.J. Storrie B. Nilsson T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1939-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) have shown that human gp27 (hp24Œ≥3) forms a specific stoichiometric complex with GMP25 (hp24Œ±2), p24 (hp24Œ≤1), and p23 (hp24Œ¥1). We set out to investigate the association between Emp24p and other p24s. Our data point to the involvement of a region of the lumenal domain of the proteins that includes a heptad repeat region, suggesting that coiled-coil interactions between p24 proteins are at least in part responsible for the assembly of p24 complexes. Yeast strains used were AYS927 (MATa/MATŒ± ade2‚Äì1/ade2‚Äì1 his3‚Äì11/his3‚Äì11 leu2‚Äì3, 112/leu2‚Äì3, 112 trp1‚Äì1/trp1‚Äì1 ura3‚Äì1/ura3‚Äì1 can1‚Äì100/can1‚Äì100 ssd1-d2/ssd1-d2 Gal + /Gal +) and YLC200 (MATŒ± ura3‚Äì52 trp1 leu2Œî1 his3Œî200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Œî1.6R can1 GAL) (this latter strain is a renamed version of BJ2454 obtained from the Yeast Genetic Stock Center, University of California, Berkeley, CA). YLC200 was used for the construction of strains bearing deletions of either ERV25 orEMP24. In both cases, a flanking PCR method was used: primers amplified a G418 resistance determinant from the plasmid pFA6 kanMX (21.Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2232) Google Scholar) and carried 45-base pair 5‚Ä≤ extensions to direct gene replacement. Strain YLC200 was transformed with purified PCR product, and transformants were selected on medium containing 200 Œºg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then tested for the presence of the gene disruption using PCR. The emp24Œî33 allele removes codons 16‚Äì189 of the EMP24 gene; the erv25Œî44allele removes codons 16‚Äì197 of the ERV25 gene. Yeast cells were grown in YEPD medium (1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, and 2% glucose) or selective medium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and supplements as required). In all experiments involving growth of transformed strains on minimal medium, the control strain contained the vector YCpU to allow growth of all strains in the same medium. Except where indicated, all plasmid constructs were created using DNA fragments generated by Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) and were verified by DNA sequencing of the coding region. DNA fragments carrying either the ERV25 or theEMP24 region of the S. cerevisiae genome were amplified from AYS927 DNA. The EMP24 fragment starts at position ‚Äì246 and ends at position 282 downstream of theEMP24 stop codon. The ERV25 fragment starts at position ‚Äì276 and ends at position 324 downstream of theERV25 stop codon. In both cases the PCR primers incorporated restriction sites (for BamHI and HindIII) allowing insertion into the plasmid YCpU (same as YCplac33; Ref. 22.Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2510) Google Scholar), generating the plasmids YCpEmp24 and YCpErv25. A mutant allele of EMP24 in which the four residues165ESTN168 were altered to AAAA was generated by use of a four primer PCR-based strategy using two mutagenic primers (ATAGAAATACTGCAGCAGCTGCAGCAGATCGTGTTAAATGG and CCATTTAACACGATCTGCTGCAGCTGCTGCAGTATTTCTAT); the flanking primers used were the same as those used in the cloning of the EMP24gene. PCRs were carried out with YCpEMP24 DNA as template. The resulting PCR product was ligated into YCpU as described for theEMP24 and ERV25 fragments, generating the plasmid YCpEMP24‚Äì165/168. To create an N-terminally His-tagged form of Emp24p, a mutant allele ofEMP24 was created in which an extra seven His codons were inserted between the codons for Ala-20 and His-21 of the Emp24p precursor. His-21 is the N-terminal residue of mature Emp24p; the strategy was the same as that outlined above for the position 165/168 allele, with the primers CACCATCACCACCACCATCATCATAATGTCCTTCTTCCAGCT and ATGATGGTGGTGGTGATGGTGGGCGGACGCCGAGAAGAA. Three EMP24-ERV25 fusions were constructed to encode chimeric proteins: Emv98p, Emv146p, and Emv164p, named for the last Emp24p-specific residue present. Emv98p consists of Emp24p1‚Äì98 + CF + Erv25p101‚Äì211; Emv146p consists of Emp24p 1‚Äì146 + Erv25p155‚Äì211; and Emv164p consists of Emp24p1‚Äì164 + ESTN + Erv25p177‚Äì211. To create the the gene fusion encoding Emv146, we introduced a SalI site into the EMP24 sequence in the position corresponding to the single SalI site present in ERV25, using the four primer strategy with two mutagenic primers (TTAACCAGGGAAGTCGTCGACGAACAAAGTTATATTG and ATAACTTTGTTCGTCGACGACTTCCCTGGTTAA), EMP24 flanking primers, and YCpEmp24 DNA as template. The mutagenesis resulted in the change K147V. The plasmid YCpEmv146 was created by ligating aBamHI-SalI fragment from the mutatedEMP24 gene (corresponding to the EMP24 promoter and the N terminus of Emp24p) into YCpErv25, which had been similarly digested to remove the corresponding portion of ERV25. The gene fusions encoding Emv98p and Emv164p were created directly by the four primer method: for each fusion, in the first stage, two PCR fragments were generated, corresponding to the two portions of the hybrid gene. One of these fragments was derived from YCpEmp24 template using the upstream flanking EMP24 primer together with either ACGATACTGAGCCTGATTTTCGAAACAGTATTGGAAATGTCC (for Emv98) or CCCTTCTGTTGGTAGATTCTGCAGTATTTCTATGCGTCCT (for Emv164). The other was derived from YCpErv25 template using the downstream flankingERV25 primer together with either GGACATTTCCAATACTGTTTCGAAAATCAGGCTCAGTATCGT (for Emv98) or AGGACGCATAGAAATACTGCAGAATCTACCAACAGAAGGG (for Emv164). The products from the first stage reactions were then purified, mixed, and used as template in a second PCR with the upstream flankingEMP24 primer and the downstream flanking ERV25primer. The resulting PCR product was then ligated into YCpU generating plasmids YCpEmv98 and YCpEmv164. Two ERV25-EMP24-ERV25 gene fusions were constructed to encode chimeric proteins: Rmr146p and Rmr164p. These chimeras are named for their Emv parent. Rmr146p consists of Erv25p 1‚Äì98 + Emv146p 99‚Äì203; Rmr164p consists of Erv25p 1‚Äì98 + Emv164p 99‚Äì203 The genes encoding the Rmr98p and Rmr146p chimeras were generated using the primers ACGGCATTCGACGTTTGTTTTTTGAACGAGAACACCGG and CCGGTGTTCTCGTTCAAAAAACAAACGTCGAATGCCGT. The former primer was used together with the downstream ERV25 primer and template DNA (YCpEmv146 or YCpEmv164 as appropriate), whereas the latter primer was used together with the upstream ERV25 primer and YCpErv25 template. A second PCR was then carried out with the twoERV25 primers to generate the new DNA fragment for cloning into YCpU. The two plasmids obtained were YCpRmr146 and YCpRmr164. Polyclonal antisera directed against the lumenal portions of Emp24p and Erv25p were raised in rabbits using protein A fusion proteins as antigens at the Scottish Antibody Production Unit. For Emp24p, the primers (GAATTCCATATGCATAATGTCCTTCTTCCAGC and CTCGAGGCTCTTCCGCATTTAACACGATCGTTGGTCGAC) were used to amplify a 486-base pair product using AYS927 DNA as template. The PCR product was ligated directly into SmaI-digested pK19 (23.Pridmore R.D. Gene. 1987; 56: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and sequenced; this revealed that part of the EcoRI site in the primer was lost during cloning. Flanking polylinker sites were used to transfer anEcoRI-SphI DNA fragment into the protein A fusion vector pAX11 (24.Zueco J. Boyd A. Gene. 1992; 121: 181-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid encodes a protein A fusion containing amino acids His-21 to Lys-172 of Emp24p (His-21 is the N-terminal residue of the mature protein; Lys-172 is likely to be the last residue of the lumenal domain). For Erv25p, the primers GAATTCCATATGTTACATTTCGACATTGCAGC and CTCGAGGCTCTTCCGCATCTTACCCTTCTGTTGGTAG were used to amplify a 510-base pair product using AYS927 DNA as template. The PCR product was ligated directly into SmaI-digested pK19 and sequenced; this revealed that parts of both primers were missing, but flanking polylinker sites were used to transfer anEcoRI-SphI DNA fragment into pAX11. The resulting plasmid encodes a protein A fusion containing amino acids Leu-21 to Arg-180 of Erv25p (Leu-21 is the N-terminal residue of the mature protein; Arg-180 is likely to be the last residue of the lumenal domain). In each case, an EcoRI-SphI fragment was then transferred into the plasmid pEX11 (25.Kusters J.G. Jager E.J. van der Zeijst B.A.M.

The synthesis of protein A fusion proteins was induced in mid-log bacterial cultures by the addition of 0.3 mm isopropyl Œ≤-d-thiogalactoside. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cultures of yeast transformants grown to early stationary phase in selective medium were used to inoculate YEPD medium to an A 600 of 0.5 and then grown for 6 h to early stationary phase (A 600 of approximately 2.5). Two methods were used to analyze proteins in the culture medium: in some experiments, proteins were precipitated from 20 ml of culture supernatant using trichloroacetic acid (final concentration, 10%) with 0.015% sodium deoxycholate as carrier, and pellets were dissolved directly in SDS sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. In other experiments, samples of culture supernatant were mixed directly with SDS sample buffer. The amount of material loaded was adjusted according to theA 600 of the culture so that directly comparable amounts of secreted material were analyzed. Kar2p was detected by immunoblotting using rabbit anti-Kar2p antiserum provided by Dr Jeremy Brown, University of Edinburgh. The procedure used was essentially that described (26.Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in selective medium to an A 600 of approximately 0.4, whereupon 400 A 600 units of cells were harvested and converted to spheroplasts. Sucrose gradients consisted of (w/w) 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, 50, and 54% sucrose. Following centrifugation for 2.5 h in an SW41 rotor at 38,000 rpm (174,000 √ó g), 330-Œºl fractions were collected and analyzed. GDPase was assayed using published methods (27.Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis, samples were pooled in pairs and analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE. Cultures were grown in selective medium to mid logarithmic phase (A 600 = 0.4). Cells were converted to spheroplasts and lysed by homogenization. Following a low speed centrifugation to remove unbroken spheroplasts, membranes were recovered by centrifugation for 30 min at 158,000 √ó g. Membranes (equivalent to 200 A 600 units of cells) were resuspended in Buffer A (150 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 2% Triton X-100) containing 10 mmimidazole and incubated on ice for 30 min. Solubilized membrane proteins were recovered in the supernatant following centrifugation at 158,000 √ó g for 15 min. This supernatant was incubated with 20 Œºl of Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 ¬∞C. Unbound material was recovered, and the agarose was then washed with 400 Œºl of Buffer A + 20 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were then eluted with Buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. Equivalent samples of total solubilized material, unbound material, and eluate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. We set out to define the region of Emp24p that is responsible for its assembly into p24 hetero-oligomeric complexes, using the stabilization of Erv25p as a convenient indicator of assembly. The approach taken was to create Emp24p-Erv25p chimeras. Although Emp24p and Erv25p are both members of the p24 family of proteins, they are only distantly related to one another: as shown in Fig.1 A, apart from two conserved cysteine residues in their N-terminal portions, the main region of close identity of these proteins lies in their C-terminal regions. We constructed three gene fusions encoding Emv proteins (Emp-Erv chimera), in which C-terminal portions of Emp24p were replaced by the corresponding sequence from Erv25p (Fig.1 B). In Emv164p, the substituted sequence of 34 residues encompasses the C-terminal transmembrane domain and cytosolic tail, together with a short conserved region from the lumenal domain. In Emv146p, a further 18 residues of the lumenal sequence of Emp24p was replaced with the corresponding Erv25p sequence. Beyond this point in the two sequences, the alignment breaks down; the position of the junction in Emv98p corresponds to the second conserved cysteine residue, lying ‚àº50 residues further upstream. There was no obvious basis upon which to construct Emv chimeras intermediate to Emv146p and Emv98p. Cells expressing one of the three Emv chimeras in place of Emp24p were analyzed for the presence both of the chimeric proteins and of Erv25p (Fig. 1 C). As expected, deletion of the EMP24gene caused a marked reduction in the level of Erv25p, and the reintroduction of EMP24 on a centromeric plasmid restored Emp24p and Erv25p to normal levels. The chimeric proteins Emv164p and Emv146p were detected at levels similar to Emp24p, and their presence was accompanied by restored levels of Erv25p. However, Emv98p was only weakly detected, and in this strain, Erv25p remained at the same low level seen in the absence of an Emp24p-related protein. Because Emv chimeras are detected by both antisera direct comparisons of the levels of the different Emv proteins are not reliable. Because Emv146p is able to stabilize Erv25p, we conclude that Emv146p can replace Emp24p in p24 complexes, indicating that a portion of Emp24p sequence lying to the N-terminal side of Lys-147 is sufficient to specify the assembly of Emp24p into heteromeric complexes; Emp24p sequences downstream of this point may participate in the inferred interaction with other p24 proteins, but these are not essential for Emp24p-specific interactions. The failure of Emv98p to stabilize Erv25p suggests that the region of Emp24 between residues Leu-101 and Lys-147 is, however, essential for this property of Emp24p. The absence of Emp24p results in the secretion of lumenal ER proteins, such as Kar2p (12.Elrod-Erickson M.J. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1043-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We tested the Emv chimeras for their ability to reverse this effect (Fig. 1 C): Emv164p was able to reduce secretion of Kar2p as effectively as Emp24p, Emv146p gave a partial restoration of Kar2p localization, and Emv98p had no effect. This result suggests that the p24 complex formed by Emv146p may be partially defective, even though Erv25p levels are fully restored, pointing to an important functional role for the portion of Emp24p that lies near the lumenal surface of the ER membrane. Further support for this idea comes from the analysis of an Emp24p mutant in which residues 165‚Äì168 (ESTN) have been replaced with alanines. This form of Emp24p is also fully able to restore Erv25p but does not restore normal localization of Kar2p (Fig. 1 C). Reports that p24 proteins are found in both the ER and the Golgi (15.Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nilsson T. J.

A. 1997; 94: 11393-11398Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) are consistent with the suggestion that the proteins are involved in the formation of COPII vesicles at the ER membrane and of COPI vesicles at the Golgi membrane. To further characterize cells containing Emv146p, we compared the subcellular distribution of Erv25p in this strain with that seen in a wild-type strain in which Emp24p and Erv25p were found broadly distributed across a sucrose density gradient with peaks co-localizing with the Golgi marker enzyme GDPase and with the ER membrane protein Sec61p (Fig. 2). In cells containing Emv164p in place of Emp24p, the chimera and Erv25p showed a relative distribution similar to that seen in wild-type cells, indicating that the Erp complexes incorporating the chimera behave normally. We do not believe the apparent shift in distribution of Sec61p in the experiment shown to be significant because measurements of sucrose concentration in the gradient fractions indicate that the peaks of Sec61p occurred at similar densities on the two gradients. If residues Leu-101 to Lys-147 of Emp24p are responsible for the assembly of the protein into a hetero-oligomeric complex with other p24 proteins, then perhaps Emv98p, containing the corresponding region from Erv25p, might show Erv25p-like behavior and be stabilized by Emp24p. To test this idea, we compared the levels of Emv98p in cells lacking either Emp24p or Erv25p. As shown in Fig.3 A, the instability of Erv25p in a strain lacking Emp24p is accentuated in stationary phase cells, with Erv25p being undetectable in this strain but fully stabilized by the presence of Emv146p. To assess the influence of Emp24p upon the stability of Emv98p, we therefore compared levels of the latter protein in cells containing either Emp24p or Erv25p, in both growing and stationary cultures, with Emv146p as a control (Fig. 3 B). In the presence of Erv25p, Emv146p persisted into stationary phase (Fig.3 B, left lane). In contrast, in this same background, Emv98p disappeared from stationary phase cells along with Erv25p, consistent with the conclusion that Emv98p cannot replace Emp24p in p24 complexes and thus cannot stabilize Erv25p. In cells containing Emp24p but lacking Erv25p, Emv146p persisted into stationary phase in the same way that Emp24p itself does (Fig. 3 B, second lane from right; also compare the right and second from right lanes of Fig. 3 A), and, in marked contrast to the result seen in cells lacking Emp24p, so does Emv98p (Fig. 3 B, right lane). Thus, Emv98p is stabilized in the presence of Emp24p, just like its Erv25p parent, suggesting that this chimera can mimic Erv25p by assembling into p24 complexes: in the transition from Emv146p to Emv98p, the replacement of ‚àº50 residues downstream of the second conserved cysteine converts the protein from one that is able to act like Emp24p to one that, like Erv25p, depends upon Emp24p for stability. We also tested the possibility that the region of Emp24p defined by this analysis as necessary"

Recently, it was reported that all of these putative glycosylation sites in rabbit H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit prepared from gastric mucosae are fully modified with carbohydrate chains (8.Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1562-C1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Tyagarajan K. Lipniunas P.H. Townsend R.R. Forte J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10200-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The structures of the oligosaccharide chains of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit are unique in that they contain no sialic acid (17.Tyagarajan K. Lipniunas P.H. Townsend R.R. Forte J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10200-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the unique structure of oligosaccharide chains of the Œ≤-subunit reflects the adaptation of the H+,K+-ATPase to the acidic environment of the stomach (18.Tyagarajan K. Townsend R.R. Forte J.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Recently, Klaassen et al. (19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that theN-linked carbohydrate chains are essential for the activity of the H+,K+-ATPase expressed in Sf9 cells using a glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin. However, there has been no study that shows the functional role of the carbohydrate chains of the H+,K+-ATPase in an expression system derived from mammalian cells. The significance of each individual carbohydrate chain on the Œ≤-subunit also has not been studied yet. In this study, we removed the carbohydrate chains of rabbit H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit in a stepwise fashion by mutating its N-glycosylation sites and expressed it together with the wild-type Œ±-subunit in human HEK-293 and COS-1 cells. We studied the functional role of each of the carbohydrate chains on the H+,K+-ATPase activity, the assembly between Œ±- and Œ≤-subunits, and the intracellular localization of each subunit.DISCUSSIONH+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit shows a number of structural similarities with Na+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit. Both Œ≤-subunits consist of a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, one transmembrane domain and a large extracellular domain. This extracellular domain contains six conserved cysteine residues involved in the formation of three disulfide bonds and several carbohydrate chains. The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains are replaceable between these two ATPases for the functional expression of H+,K+-ATPase, but the majority of the extracellular domain is not replaceable (23.Asano S. Kimura T. Ueno S. Kawamura M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22257-22265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The number and complexity of the carbohydrate chains on the Œ≤-subunit are different between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase. Na+,K+-ATPase Œ≤1-subunit contains threeN-linked carbohydrate chains. Tamkun and Fambrough (27.Tamkun M.M. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that glycosylation of the Œ≤-subunit was not required for the subunit assembly and not involved in the rate of intracellular transport of the Œ±/Œ≤ complex to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, glycosylation was not required to protect the Na+,K+-ATPase from degradation in the chick sensory neurons. Zamofing et al. (28.Zamofing D. Rossier B.C. Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C959-C968Crossref Google Scholar) reported that Na+,K+-ATPase in toad urinary bladder cells incubated with tunicamycin was active in both hydrolytic and transport activities. Takeda et al. (29.Takeda K. Noguchi S. Sugino A. Kawamura M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) expressed Na+,K+-ATPase in Xenopus oocytes by injecting the Œ±- and Œ≤-subunit cRNAs and incubating the oocytes in the presence of tunicamycin. The oligosaccharide-deficient ATPase was transported to the plasma membrane and exhibited the same Na+,K+-ATPase and 86Rb+transport activities as the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase. Beggah et al. (30.Beggah A.T. Jaunin P. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10318-10326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) abolished the three N-glycosylation sites of the Œ≤-subunit by site-directed mutagenesis and found that the deglycosylated Œ≤-subunit was able to associate with the Œ±-subunit and express the functional Na+,K+-ATPase (86Rb uptake and [3H]ouabain binding) on the cell surface ofXenopus oocytes.H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit contains six or sevenN-linked carbohydrate chains. Klaassen et al.(19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) expressed H+,K+-ATPase in insect Sf9 cells in the presence of tunicamycin. Tunicamycin completely abolished the K+-ATPase activity and SCH 28080-sensitive phosphorylation capacity of the enzyme expressed in Sf9 cells, whereas the expression level and assembly of Œ±- and Œ≤-subunit proteins were unaffected, indicating that the carbohydrate chains are essential for biosynthesis of functional ATPase. Therefore, the role of the carbohydrate chains on the ATPase function is quite different between Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase.In this study, we examined the role of carbohydrate chains of the Œ≤-subunit on the functions of H+,K+-ATPase in mammalian cells, because there are striking differences in the glycosylation state of the Œ≤-subunit and the localization of Œ±/Œ≤ complex between wild-type H+,K+-ATPases expressed in insect and mammalian cells. When the H+,K+-ATPase was expressed in Sf9 cells, the molecular mass of carbohydrate chains was smaller than that reported in the native H+,K+-ATPase (10.Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwe G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); a large percentage of the Œ≤-subunit contained high mannose-type carbohydrate chains, and there was little Œ≤-subunit-associated complex-type carbohydrate chains (19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nonglycosylated Œ≤-subunit (protein core) was also observed on the Western blot. Catalytically active H+,K+-ATPase Œ±/Œ≤ complexes were localized to intracellular membranes, and the Œ±-subunit was not observed on the plasma membrane of Sf9 cells (19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings in Sf9 cells, we found that H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunits expressed in HEK-293 cells contained carbohydrate chains, a large fraction of which were high mannose-type carbohydrate chains. Nonglycosylated Œ≤-subunit was not observed on the Western blot. The Œ±-subunits associated with the Œ≤-subunit were observed to be delivered to the plasma membrane.In the expression system using mammalian cells, no H+,K+-ATPase activity was observed in the membrane fraction of HEK cells expressing the Œ±/Œ≤ mutant VII, in which all seven carbohydrate chains were removed. This result is consistent with the previous finding that no H+,K+-ATPase activity was observed in Sf9 cells incubated with tunicamycin (19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, each carbohydrate chain was not specifically essential for the H+,K+-ATPase function, because any single mutation in the glycosylation sites of the Œ≤-subunit did not abolish the K+-ATPase activity. The effect of a series of progressive removals of carbohydrate chains from the Œ≤-subunit on the enzyme activity was cumulative, although the effect of isocharge substitution (from Asn to Gln) on the enzyme activity could not be completely excluded. The present results suggest that the carbohydrate chains of the Œ≤-subunit are collectively important for the catalytic activity of H+,K+-ATPase.Each carbohydrate chain on the Œ≤-subunit was not directly involved in the Œ±/Œ≤ assembly. However, very small amounts of Œ±/Œ≤ complex were observed when the cells were co-transfected with the Œ±-subunit plus mutant VI cDNAs. The Œ±/Œ≤ assembly was not observed after removal of all seven carbohydrate chains. Therefore, the carbohydrate chains of the Œ≤-subunit are collectively important for assembly between the Œ±- and Œ≤-subunits. The Œ≤-subunits of single mutants, double mutants, mutant III, and mutant IV contained both complex-type and high mannose-type carbohydrate chains, indicating that these subunits were able to leave the ER compartment.The carbohydrate chains on the Œ≤-subunit are important for the surface delivery of the Œ≤-subunit and the Œ±-subunit that had assembled with the Œ≤-subunit. In COS cells, no surface delivery occurred in the mutant III complex. This result contrasts with the previous finding that N-glycosylation of Na+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit is not necessary for its transport to the plasma membrane (27.Tamkun M.M. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Zamofing D. Rossier B.C. Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C959-C968Crossref Google Scholar). Further study of this difference between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase would be interesting because they have different destinations in polarized cells (apical and basolateral membranes, respectively).Rabbit gastric H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit contains seven glycosylation sites. Therefore, theoretically, it is necessary to prepare all the combinations of mutants (127 mutants) and analyze the functions of the all mutants to precisely study the roles of each carbohydrate chain and the possible interactions between the carbohydrate chains. Here, we prepared one series of the representative plural mutants and analyzed their functions because all seven single mutants showed almost equivalent effects. It cannot be completely excluded that some specific interactions between certain combination of carbohydrate chains are more important than others for some functions of the ATPase.In conclusion, from the present series of experiments, it has been found that different levels of glycosylation of the Œ≤-subunit are necessary for the ATPase activity, assembly, and the surface delivery of the Œ±- and Œ≤-subunits. Surface delivery of the Œ±- and Œ≤-subunits is more dependent on the carbohydrate chains than the expression of the H+,K+-ATPase activity and Œ±/Œ≤ assembly. Gastric proton pump, H+,K+-ATPase, consists of two kinds of subunits. One is a catalytic Œ±-subunit with a molecular mass of 114 kDa (1.Shull G.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16788-16791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which contains an ATP-binding site, an acyl-phosphorylation site (2.Walderhaug M.O. Post R.L. Saccomani G. Leonard R.T.

Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6767-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Both subunits are essential for the functional expression of H+,K+-ATPase, which has been observed in Sf9 cells (10.Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwe G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P.

Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 2740-2745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The Œ≤-subunit is involved in the structural and functional maturation of the holoenzyme and intracellular transport of the ATPase (12.Chow D.C. Browning C.M. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C39-C46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the sugar content of the H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit is very high and almost all of theN-glycosylation sites of the Œ≤-subunit are conserved among different animals, the role of carbohydrate chains in the function of H+,K+-ATPase has not been clearly understood. Rabbit H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit contains seven putative N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa-Ser and Asn-Xaa-Thr); Asn-99, Asn-103, Asn-130, Asn-146, Asn-161, Asn-193, and Asn-222 (9.Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S.

Recently, it was reported that all of these putative glycosylation sites in rabbit H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit prepared from gastric mucosae are fully modified with carbohydrate chains (8.Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1562-C1570Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Tyagarajan K. Lipniunas P.H. Townsend R.R. Forte J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10200-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The structures of the oligosaccharide chains of the gastric H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit are unique in that they contain no sialic acid (17.Tyagarajan K. Lipniunas P.H. Townsend R.R. Forte J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10200-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the unique structure of oligosaccharide chains of the Œ≤-subunit reflects the adaptation of the H+,K+-ATPase to the acidic environment of the stomach (18.Tyagarajan K. Townsend R.R. Forte J.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3238-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, Klaassen et al. (19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported that theN-linked carbohydrate chains are essential for the activity of the H+,K+-ATPase expressed in Sf9 cells using a glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin. However, there has been no study that shows the functional role of the carbohydrate chains of the H+,K+-ATPase in an expression system derived from mammalian cells. The significance of each individual carbohydrate chain on the Œ≤-subunit also has not been studied yet. In this study, we removed the carbohydrate chains of rabbit H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit in a stepwise fashion by mutating its N-glycosylation sites and expressed it together with the wild-type Œ±-subunit in human HEK-293 and COS-1 cells. We studied the functional role of each of the carbohydrate chains on the H+,K+-ATPase activity, the assembly between Œ±- and Œ≤-subunits, and the intracellular localization of each subunit. DISCUSSIONH+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit shows a number of structural similarities with Na+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit. Both Œ≤-subunits consist of a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain, one transmembrane domain and a large extracellular domain. This extracellular domain contains six conserved cysteine residues involved in the formation of three disulfide bonds and several carbohydrate chains. The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains are replaceable between these two ATPases for the functional expression of H+,K+-ATPase, but the majority of the extracellular domain is not replaceable (23.Asano S. Kimura T. Ueno S. Kawamura M. Takeguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22257-22265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The number and complexity of the carbohydrate chains on the Œ≤-subunit are different between H+,K+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase. Na+,K+-ATPase Œ≤1-subunit contains threeN-linked carbohydrate chains. Tamkun and Fambrough (27.Tamkun M.M. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that glycosylation of the Œ≤-subunit was not required for the subunit assembly and not involved in the rate of intracellular transport of the Œ±/Œ≤ complex to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, glycosylation was not required to protect the Na+,K+-ATPase from degradation in the chick sensory neurons. Zamofing et al. (28.Zamofing D. Rossier B.C. Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C959-C968Crossref Google Scholar) reported that Na+,K+-ATPase in toad urinary bladder cells incubated with tunicamycin was active in both hydrolytic and transport activities. Takeda et al. (29.Takeda K. Noguchi S. Sugino A. Kawamura M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) expressed Na+,K+-ATPase in Xenopus oocytes by injecting the Œ±- and Œ≤-subunit cRNAs and incubating the oocytes in the presence of tunicamycin. The oligosaccharide-deficient ATPase was transported to the plasma membrane and exhibited the same Na+,K+-ATPase and 86Rb+transport activities as the wild-type Na+,K+-ATPase. Beggah et al. (30.Beggah A.T. Jaunin P. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10318-10326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) abolished the three N-glycosylation sites of the Œ≤-subunit by site-directed mutagenesis and found that the deglycosylated Œ≤-subunit was able to associate with the Œ±-subunit and express the functional Na+,K+-ATPase (86Rb uptake and [3H]ouabain binding) on the cell surface ofXenopus oocytes.H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit contains six or sevenN-linked carbohydrate chains. Klaassen et al.(19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) expressed H+,K+-ATPase in insect Sf9 cells in the presence of tunicamycin. Tunicamycin completely abolished the K+-ATPase activity and SCH 28080-sensitive phosphorylation capacity of the enzyme expressed in Sf9 cells, whereas the expression level and assembly of Œ±- and Œ≤-subunit proteins were unaffected, indicating that the carbohydrate chains are essential for biosynthesis of functional ATPase. Therefore, the role of the carbohydrate chains on the ATPase function is quite different between Na+,K+-ATPase and H+,K+-ATPase.In this study, we examined the role of carbohydrate chains of the Œ≤-subunit on the functions of H+,K+-ATPase in mammalian cells, because there are striking differences in the glycosylation state of the Œ≤-subunit and the localization of Œ±/Œ≤ complex between wild-type H+,K+-ATPases expressed in insect and mammalian cells. When the H+,K+-ATPase was expressed in Sf9 cells, the molecular mass of carbohydrate chains was smaller than that reported in the native H+,K+-ATPase (10.Klaassen C.H.W. Van Uem T.J.F. De Moel M.P. De Caluwe G.L.J. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 329: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); a large percentage of the Œ≤-subunit contained high mannose-type carbohydrate chains, and there was little Œ≤-subunit-associated complex-type carbohydrate chains (19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nonglycosylated Œ≤-subunit (protein core) was also observed on the Western blot. Catalytically active H+,K+-ATPase Œ±/Œ≤ complexes were localized to intracellular membranes, and the Œ±-subunit was not observed on the plasma membrane of Sf9 cells (19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast to these findings in Sf9 cells, we found that H+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunits expressed in HEK-293 cells contained carbohydrate chains, a large fraction of which were high mannose-type carbohydrate chains. Nonglycosylated Œ≤-subunit was not observed on the Western blot. The Œ±-subunits associated with the Œ≤-subunit were observed to be delivered to the plasma membrane.In the expression system using mammalian cells, no H+,K+-ATPase activity was observed in the membrane fraction of HEK cells expressing the Œ±/Œ≤ mutant VII, in which all seven carbohydrate chains were removed. This result is consistent with the previous finding that no H+,K+-ATPase activity was observed in Sf9 cells incubated with tunicamycin (19.Klaassen C.H. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, each carbohydrate chain was not specifically essential for the H+,K+-ATPase function, because any single mutation in the glycosylation sites of the Œ≤-subunit did not abolish the K+-ATPase activity. The effect of a series of progressive removals of carbohydrate chains from the Œ≤-subunit on the enzyme activity was cumulative, although the effect of isocharge substitution (from Asn to Gln) on the enzyme activity could not be completely excluded. The present results suggest that the carbohydrate chains of the Œ≤-subunit are collectively important for the catalytic activity of H+,K+-ATPase.Each carbohydrate chain on the Œ≤-subunit was not directly involved in the Œ±/Œ≤ assembly. However, very small amounts of Œ±/Œ≤ complex were observed when the cells were co-transfected with the Œ±-subunit plus mutant VI cDNAs. The Œ±/Œ≤ assembly was not observed after removal of all seven carbohydrate chains. Therefore, the carbohydrate chains of the Œ≤-subunit are collectively important for assembly between the Œ±- and Œ≤-subunits. The Œ≤-subunits of single mutants, double mutants, mutant III, and mutant IV contained both complex-type and high mannose-type carbohydrate chains, indicating that these subunits were able to leave the ER compartment.The carbohydrate chains on the Œ≤-subunit are important for the surface delivery of the Œ≤-subunit and the Œ±-subunit that had assembled with the Œ≤-subunit. In COS cells, no surface delivery occurred in the mutant III complex. This result contrasts with the previous finding that N-glycosylation of Na+,K+-ATPase Œ≤-subunit is not necessary for its transport to the plasma membrane (27.Tamkun M.M. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Zamofing D. Rossier B.C. Geering K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C959-C968Crossref Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2137360953,"Two Trypanosoma brucei cyclin genes,CYC2 and CYC3, have been isolated by rescue of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant DL1, which is deficient in CLN G1 cyclin function. CYC2 encodes a 24-kDa protein that has sequence identity to the Neurospora crassa PREG1 and the S. cerevisiae PHO80 cyclin. CYC3 has the most sequence identity to mitotic B-type cyclins from a variety of organisms. Both CYC2 and CYC3 are single-copy genes and expressed in all life cycle stages of the parasite. To determine if CYC2 is found in a complex with previously identified trypanosome cdc2-related kinases (CRKs), theCYC2 gene was fused to the TY epitope tag, integrated into the trypanosome genome, and expressed under inducible control. CYC2ty was found to associate with an active trypanosome CRK complex since CYC2ty bound to leishmanial p12cks1, and histone H1 kinase activity was detected in CYC2ty immune-precipitated fractions. Gene knockout experiments provide evidence thatCYC2 is an essential gene, and co-immune precipitations together with a two-hybrid interaction assay demonstrated that CYC2 interacts with CRK3. The CRK3¬∑CYC2ty complex, the first cyclin-dependent kinase complex identified in trypanosomes, was localized by immune fluorescence to the cytoplasm throughout the cell cycle.

CYC2ty was found to associate with an active trypanosome CRK complex since CYC2ty bound to leishmanial p12cks1, and histone H1 kinase activity was detected in CYC2ty immune-precipitated fractions. Gene knockout experiments provide evidence thatCYC2 is an essential gene, and co-immune precipitations together with a two-hybrid interaction assay demonstrated that CYC2 interacts with CRK3. The CRK3¬∑CYC2ty complex, the first cyclin-dependent kinase complex identified in trypanosomes, was localized by immune fluorescence to the cytoplasm throughout the cell cycle. The parasitic protozoon Trypanosoma brucei belongs to the family of Trypanosomatidae, which is thought to be one of the earliest branching eukaryotic families to contain a mitochondrion (1.Sogin M.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1991; 1: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The African trypanosome, T. brucei, is responsible for the clinically important diseases, sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Trypanosomes have a complex life cycle that alternates between insect and mammalian hosts with different developmental forms having specific roles within each host. The rapidly dividing forms such as the long slender bloodstream form in the mammal or the procyclic form in the gut of the tsetse fly vector establish an infection in the host. The parasite also has a nondividing short stumpy bloodstream form, which is arrested in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and is preadapted for survival when the organism passes into the tsetse (2.Vickerman K. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). During the trypanosome life cycle there is an integral link between the control of the cell cycle and parasite differentiation (3.Matthews K.R. Gull K. Parasitol. Today. 1994; 10: 473-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and there is a special need to coordinate replication and segregation of its single organelles: the nucleus, mitochondrion, and flagellum (4.Woodward R. Gull K. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 49-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, trypanosomes have added complexity in cell cycle control not present in many single-cell eukaryotes such as yeast. The similarities and differences between the regulation of the cell cycle in trypanosomatids and other eukaryotes provide important information about the evolution of regulatory systems controlling the cell cycle. However, little is known in molecular terms of how the trypanosome cell cycle is controlled. Cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is regulated by a family of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are; CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; CRK, cdc2-related kinase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); kb, kilobase pair(s); PARP, procyclic acidic repetitive protein. that require association with cyclin regulatory partners for activity. The first CDKs identified, Schizosaccharomyces pombe cdc2 andSaccharomyces cerevisiae CDC28, are highly conserved in evolution and were the first of the CDK family (CDK1) to be shown to have a central role in cell cycle control (5.Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar, 6.Nasmyth K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). CDKs have since been shown to have roles in other cellular functions such as transcriptional regulation and response to stress (7.Hardie D.G. Cell. Signal. 1994; 6: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The activity of CDKs can be controlled post-translationally by a number of different mechanisms: the association of the kinase subunit with its positive regulatory cyclin partner, phosphorylation of conserved sites, which can stimulate or inhibit kinase activity, and the binding of CDK inhibitor proteins (8.Johnson D.G. Walker C.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Since binding of a cyclin partner is essential for full CDK activity, the concentrations of the cyclins are tightly controlled by transcriptional regulation as well as a timing of proteolysis (9.Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In addition to the concentration of the cyclin ‚Äúcycling‚Äù during the cell cycle, cyclins are characterized by the presence of a 100-amino acid region of sequence similarity to the consensus cyclin box, which is involved in binding to their CDK partner (10.Brown N.R. Noble M.E.M. Endicott J.A. Garman E.F. Wakatsuki S. Mitchell E. Rasmussen B. Hunt T. Johnson L.N. Structure. 1995; 3: 1235-1247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 11.Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. MassagueÃÅ J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). So far, a large family of cyclin genes has been identified in many species, of which the majority are involved in regulation of the cell cycle (8.Johnson D.G. Walker C.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Mitotic cyclins contain a characteristic nine-amino acid destruction box motif, which targets cyclins for degradation at the end of mitosis (12.Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar). G1 cyclins are more divergent, and some have C-terminal PEST sequences, which are involved in their degradation (13.Arnaud L. Pines J. Nigg E.A. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1998; 107: 424-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The budding yeast CDKs, CDC28 and PHO85, bind at least three different classes of cyclin, each containing between two and five members, giving a high level of functional redundancy (14.Andrews B. Measday V. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 66-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Higher eukaryotes, on the other hand, have a multiplicity of CDKs (nine at the last count) and cyclins (A-T) (8.Johnson D.G. Walker C.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 295-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). A complex regulation of the cell cycle in trypanosomatids is supported by the identification of a large family of genes with homology to CDKs. These genes were termed cdc2-relatedkinase (CRK) genes, as no cyclin partners were known to bind these kinases when they were first described. CRKs have been identified in T. brucei (15.Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16.Mottram J.C. Parasitol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5451-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The trypanosomatid CRKs have several features in common with yeast and human CDKs (16.Mottram J.C. Parasitol.

Gene. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a recognizable (but divergent) ‚ÄúPSTAIR‚Äù box, which is a domain shown to be important for cyclin binding (11.Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. MassagueÃÅ J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), and key threonine and tyrosine residues known to be important sites of phosphorylation in yeast and mammalian (9.Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The CRKs also have sequence features that distinguish them from yeast or mammalian CDKs, including an N-terminal extension for CRK2 and CRK3 (15.Mottram J.C. Smith G. Gene. 1995; 162: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and two additional domains within the catalytic domain of the kinase for CRK4 (20.Brown L. Hines J.C. Ray D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5451-5456Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 2J. R. Ford and J. C. Mottram, unpublished information. Hence the regulation of the trypanosome cell cycle, whose cell biology differs significantly from many other eukaryotic organisms, may also differ at the molecular level. In contrast to the CRKs, much less is known about the activating cycling partners in trypanosomes. So far only one putative cyclin gene,CYC1, has been identified (22.Affranchino J.L. GonzaÃÅlez S.A. Pays E. Gene. 1993; 132: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Despite evidence to suggest that this gene encodes a mitotic cyclin (22.Affranchino J.L. GonzaÃÅlez S.A. Pays E. Gene. 1993; 132: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), other studies provide no evidence that CYC1 is a functional cyclin. 3T. C. Hammarton, J. R. Ford, and J. C. Mottram, manuscript in preparation. CYC1 may be involved, however, in regulating differentiation of the bloodstream form into the procyclic form (23.Hua S.B. Mutomba M.C. Wang C.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Identification of cyclin genes has proven to be difficult due to their divergence at the primary amino acid level (24.Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1803) Google Scholar). Hence, it is crucial to define cyclins on a functional basis to validate their identification. In this study we used a functional complementation assay to isolate trypanosome cyclins based on their ability to rescue a S. cerevisiae G1cyclin conditional mutant. A variety of heterologous cyclins from species as divergent as Homo sapiens (25.Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar),Drosophila (26.Leopold P. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1991; 66: 1207-1216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis (27.Day I.S. Reddy A.S.N. Golovkin M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 565-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have been shown to rescue cln1,2,3 lethality. This functional complementation assay enabled us to identify two novel T. brucei cyclin genes, CYC2 and CYC3, and to define the first trypanosome cyclin-dependent kinase complex. All standard DNA techniques were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed according to the lithium acetate procedure (29.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid recovery from yeast used the glass bead-phenol technique (30.Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene. 1987; 57: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (2043) Google Scholar) followed by transformation of Escherichia coli. Plasmid isolation from E. coli was performed using Qiaprep columns (Qiagen). DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI automatic sequencer. The complementation study was performed with the DL1 strain of S. cerevisiae in which the three CLN genes (CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3) were inactivated, and a chimeric gene consisting of the GAL1 promoter fused to the CLN2 protein-coding region was integrated at the LEU2chromosomal locus (25.Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The GAL1 promoter directs high level expression when the cells are grown on galactose-containing medium but is repressed if the cells are grown on a medium containing glucose. DL1 cells are able to grow on galactose-based medium but arrest in G1 on a glucose-based medium. DL1 cells were transformed with a T. brucei cDNA library, which was constructed in the yeast expression vector pRS416-met (31.Mazhari-Tabrizi R. Eckert V. Blank M. MuÃàller R. Mumberg D. Funk M. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The pRS416 vector carries the URA3 gene as a selectable marker, and the cDNAs are fused with the MET25 promoter at the 5‚Ä≤ end and the CYC1 terminator at the 3‚Ä≤ end. Antipeptide antisera were raised against the last 9 amino acids of CRK1 (EHPYFSVEF) and the last 16 amino acids of CRK2 (EVREEEVEKLMRFNGA). Peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize rabbits using standard procedures (32.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Antiserum specific to CRK3 was raised by immunization of rabbits with purified recombinant CRK3 that was tagged with six histidines at its N terminus (33.Glasssmith G. Characterization of cdc2-related Kinases from Trypanosoma brucei. PhD thesis. University of Glasgow, 1997Google Scholar). The mouse monoclonal antibody BB2 (34.Bastin P. Bagherzadeh A. Matthews K.R. Gull K. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 77: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) was used as the anti-TY antibody. Two annealed oligonucleotides (OL49 and OL50, see TableI), which composed the TY-epitope flanked by BglII-compatible overhangs, were ligated into the uniqueBglII site near the C terminus of CYC2 (Fig. 2), after which proper integration of the TY tag was confirmed by sequence analysis. Subsequently, CYC2ty was cloned in the unique EcoRI andXhoI sites of the yeast expression vector pRS416-met (31.Mazhari-Tabrizi R. Eckert V. Blank M. MuÃàller R. Mumberg D. Funk M. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to produce plasmid pGL387. In addition, CYC2ty was also cloned into the single Bsp120I site of the tetracycline-inducible trypanosome expression vector pHD675 (35.Biebinger S. Wirtz E. Lorenz P. Clayton C.E. Mol. Biochem.

Acta Trop. 1979; 36: 289-292PubMed Google Scholar) containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Transfection of procyclic trypanosome cells was performed by an electroporation method. 107 procyclic trypanosomes from a mid-log phase culture were harvested and washed in transfection buffer (132 mm NaCl, 8 mm KCl, 8 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 1.5 mmMg(C2H3O2)2¬∑H2O and 90 ŒºmCa(C2H3O2)2¬∑H20), after which the cells were resuspended in 500 Œºl of transfection buffer with 5‚Äì10 Œºg of DNA and electroporated (1500 volts/25 microfarads). Subsequently, cells were incubated in SDM-79 medium at 28 ¬∞C for 16 h, after which antibiotics were added, and cells were cloned directly by limiting dilution. Procyclic EATRO 795 cells were transfected with the pHD449 vector for constitutive expression of the tetracycline-repressor protein (35.Biebinger S. Wirtz E. Lorenz P. Clayton C.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a clonal population of these cells were transfected with the CYC2ty expression vector (pGL289, linearized with NotI), after which cells were re-cloned by limiting dilution. Induction of expression of CYC2ty was initiated in mid-log phase cultures by the addition of tetracycline (50 ng/ml), and the cells were harvested 16 h after induction by centrifugation and subsequent washing with phosphate-buffered saline (18.Grant K.M. Hassan P. Anderson J.S. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10153-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cell pellets or protein samples were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, separated on 10 or 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Western blots were performed as described before (21.Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with a 1:100 dilution of the crude antiserum directed to either CRK1, CRK2, CRK3 or with a 1:200 dilution of medium derived from cultures with the hybridoma cells producing the anti-TY antibody. Blots were performed in absence or presence of blocking peptide (2 Œºg/ml). Antigens were detected using a chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce SuperSignal). Leishmanial p12cks1 or yeast p13suc1 protein was coupled to Amino-link beads at a concentration of 5 mg ml‚àí1 as described previously (21.Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Selection of T. brucei CRKs was carried out as described for the Leishmania mexicana CRK (18.Grant K.M. Hassan P. Anderson J.S. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10153-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 108cells were lysed in 400 Œºl of lysis buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, and 1% Triton X-100) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (2.5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 100 Œºg ml‚àí1 leupeptin, 5 Œºg ml‚àí1pepstatin A, and 500 Œºg ml‚àí1 Pefabloc¬Æ SC). Lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min and then centrifuged at 100,000 √ó g for 45 min at 4 ¬∞C. The resulting supernatants (S-100 lysates) were incubated for 2 h with 40 Œºl of either control or p12cks1 or p13suc1 beads (18.Grant K.M. Hassan P. Anderson J.S. Mottram J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10153-10159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), after which the beads were extensively washed with lysis buffer and used for immunoblotting or histone H1 kinase assays. Immune-precipitations and kinase assays were performed as described previously (17.Mottram J.C. Kinnaird J. Shiels B.R. Tait A. Barry J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21044-21051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). S-100 cell extracts, prepared as described above, were incubated with 50 Œºl of serum in the absence or presence of 5 Œºg ml‚àí1 peptide for 60 min at 4 ¬∞C. Subsequently, 25 Œºl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added and incubated for a further 30 min at 4 ¬∞C. After extensive washing of the Sepharose beads with lysis buffer, the beads were either resuspended in Laemmli buffer and used for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting or resuspended in kinase assay buffer (50 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiotheitol, 10 mm EGTA, 250 Œºg ml‚àí1 histone H1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 4 Œºm ATP (0.1 ŒºCi of [Œ≥-32P]ATP) and incubated for 30 min at 30 ¬∞C for a histone H1 kinase activity assay (21.Mottram J.C. Grant K.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Kinase activity of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-separated samples was examined by drying of the gel and exposure to an x-ray film. A yeast two-hybrid interaction assay was performed using the LexA Hybrid Hunter system (Invitrogen).T. brucei CRK1 and CRK3 were cloned into theEcoRI/PstI site of pHybLex/Zeo by constructing unique EcoRI and PstI sites on the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ ends of the coding region by PCR. The inserts for CRK1 (pGL176) and CRK3 (pGL177) were sequenced to confirm in-frame fusions with LexA and to check that no PCR mutations had been introduced. TheCYC2 and CYC3 genes were cloned into theHindIII/StuI sites of the pYESTrp vector using the same PCR-based approach to give plasmids pGL182 and pGL181, respectively. These produced fusions with the B42 domain. Bait and prey plasmids were transformed sequentially into S. cerevisiaestrain L40 (Invitrogen), and protein:protein interactions were assessed by Œ≤-galactosidase activity using a filter lift assay as described by the manufacturer. Expression of the fusion proteins was checked by Western blot analysis using antibodies (Invitrogen) against LexA and the V5-epitope, which is fused to the B42 domain, according to the manufacturer's protocol. In the absence of a sufficient 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ sequence flanking the CYC2 gene, a gene disruption approach was adopted to knock out CYC2 gene function rather than a conventional gene deletion. The CYC2 gene was disrupted by transfection with BLE and PACresistance knockout constructs. These constructs were designed to replace 160 bp of sequence in the middle of the CYC2 open reading frame with the required antibiotic resistance gene. Correct transcription and post-transcriptional processing of the drug resistance genes relied on 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ PARP control sequences. A 320-bp DNA fragment containing the 5‚Ä≤ end of CYC2 was amplified from plasmid pGL163 with primers CYC2KO5‚Ä≤5‚Ä≤ (See Table I for primer sequences) and CYC2KO5‚Ä≤3‚Ä≤ and cloned into pCR-script. A 320-bp DNA fragment containing the 3‚Ä≤ end of CYC2 was amplified from plasmid pGL163 with primers CYC2KO3‚Ä≤5‚Ä≤ and CYC2KO3‚Ä≤3‚Ä≤ and also cloned into pCR-script. CYC2KO5‚Ä≤5‚Ä≤ and CYC2KO5‚Ä≤3‚Ä≤ were engineered withSphI and XbaI sites, respectively, whereas CYC2KO3‚Ä≤5‚Ä≤ and CYC2KO3‚Ä≤3‚Ä≤ were engineered with KpnI andEcoRI sites, respectively. pBluescript-based plasmid pGL110 containing the 5‚Ä≤-PARP-PAC-3‚Ä≤-PARP cassette (derived from pJP44 (39.Sherman D.R. Janz L. Hug M. Clayton C. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3379-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)) was used to make the PAC-resistant CYC2 deletion constructs. The 320-bp KpnI/EcoRI fragment containing theCYC2 3‚Ä≤ end was cloned intoKpnI/EcoRI-digested pGL110. Subsequently, theCYC2 5‚Ä≤ flank was cloned intoSphI/XbaI sites to give pGL2. The BLE-resistant cassette (pGL1) was generated by removing the 1.7-kb 5‚Ä≤-PARP-PAC-3‚Ä≤-PARP fragment by digestion withXbaI/KpnI and replacing with the 1.5-kbXbaI/KpnI 5‚Ä≤-PARP-BLE-3‚Ä≤-PARP fragment from pGL108. The disruption cassettes were excised by digestion withSphI and EcoRI, and the insert was gel-purified using a Qiextract kit (Qiagen). Approximately 5 to 10 Œºg of DNA was used for each transfection with 4 √ó 107 mid-log procyclic STIB 247 trypanosomes, after which transfected parasites were cloned by limiting dilution. PCR analysis on integration of the CYC2 disruption cassettes was performed on chromosomal DNA prepared by a mini-prep procedure (40.Medina-Acosta E. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 327-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Distinct PCR experiments were performed in which five oligonucleotides in total were used (Table I, see also Fig.8 A). Logarithmic phase procyclic form trypanosomes were induced to express CYC2ty by the addition of 1 Œºg ml‚àí1 tetracycline. Cells were harvested, air-dried smears prepared, and slides were fixed by immersion in ‚àí20 ¬∞C methanol for at least 30 min. After fixation, slides were rehydrated in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min and then incubated with the BB2 monoclonal antibody for 45 min. After washing, anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate diluted 1:50 was applied to the slides for a further 45 min, and the cells were washed and counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1 mg/ml) and mounted in MOWIOL (Harlow Chemical Co., UK) containing 1 mg ml‚àí1 phenylenediamine as an anti-fading agent. Cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axioscope microscope, and images were captured and processed using a Hamamatsu CCD camera, NIH image 1.58, and Adobe Photoshop 5. The low level of sequence identity between cyclins of different species precludes in general the use of PCR-based approaches to identify cyclins. Hence, we used a functional complementation assay to isolate trypanosome cyclins based on their ability to rescue aS. cerevisiae G1/S phase cyclin conditional mutant. Yeast DL1 cells were transformed with a T. bruceicDNA library cloned in the yeast expression vector pRS416-met (31.Mazhari-Tabrizi R. Eckert V. Blank M. MuÃàller R. Mumberg D. Funk M. Schwarz R.T. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). 5 √ó 105 cells were plated on solid medium lacking uracil but containing glucose, and 200 transformed colonies were obtained. Of these 157 were plasmid-independent revertants that had lost the plasmid and were able to grow on glucose plates containing uracil and the antimetabolite 5-fluoro-orotic acid. The 43 remaining plasmids were recovered in E. coli and used to transform the DL1 yeast strain a second time. Transformants obtained with six of the plasmids were able to grow on the glucose-based medium, showing that these plasmids were able to complement the cyclin deficiency (Fig.1). The six cDNAs were grouped into two classes by restriction analysis and partial sequencing. The two different cDNAs of 870 bp (pGL163) and 1.79 kb (pGL164) were then sequenced, and the genes were named CYC2 andCYC3. CYC2 is predicted to encode a 24.3-kDa protein (CYC2) of 211 amino acids, with an isoelectric point of 6.82. CYC3 is predicted to encode a 46.5-kDa protein (CYC3) of 414 amino acids, with an isoelectric point of 7.24. Computer searches of data bases with the CYC2 and CYC3 protein sequences found significant homology to a wide range of cyclins. This homology is, however, restricted to a stretch of about a 100 amino acids known as the cyclin box, which is involved in binding of the CDK partner (9.Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). The cyclin box of CYC2 has 38% identity with that ofNeurospora crassa PREG1 regulatory protein (41.Kang S. Metzenberg R.L. Genetics. 1993; 133: 193-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 25% identity with the cyclin box of S. cerevisiae PHO80 cyclin (42.Kaffman A. Herskowitz I. Tjian R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and 22% identity with the cyclin box of human cyclin D3 (43.Motokura T. Keyomarsi K. Kronenberg H.M. Arnold A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20412-20415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). The cyclin box ofCYC3 has 32% identity with S. cerevisiae CLB1 (44.Surana U. Robitsch H. Price C. Schuster T. Fitch I. Futcher A.B. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 65: 145-161Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) and 32% identity with CLB2 (45.Richardson H.E. Lew D.J. Henze M. Sugimoto K. Reed S.I. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2021-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 C). Apart from the cyclin boxes, the other regions of CYC2 and CYC3 demonstrate no significant homology to any other known protein, although CYC3 does contain a destruction box-like motive (RGTLVVPRN, see F"

Ca2+influx modulates osteoblastic activities including matrix deposition, hormone responsiveness, and Ca2+-dependent signaling. 1,25(OH)2D3 also regulates transcript levels encoding VSCCs. L-type VSCCs are multisubunit complexes composed of a central pore-forming Œ±1 subunit and four additional subunits.

To increase target ablation efficiency, the ribozyme was inserted into U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) by engineering the U1 snRNA expression cassette, conferring the ribozyme transcript with stabilizing stem-loops at both sides and the Sm binding site that facilitates localization into nucleoplasm. After transfection of ROS 17/2.8 cells with U1 ribozyme-encoding vector, stable clonal cells were selected in which the expression of Œ±1C transcript and protein were strikingly reduced.

Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCCs)1 are classified as L, T, N, P/Q, and R type according to their voltage sensitivity, single-channel properties, ion selectivity, and pharmacological properties (1.Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 2.Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 715-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). A high threshold for voltage-dependent activation and sensitivity to dihydropyridine type organic channel blockers characterize L-type VSCCs that consist of five distinct subunits (Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ≤, Œ≥, and Œ¥) encoded by four genes (3.Perez-Reyes E. Schneider T. Kidney Int. 1995; 48: 1111-1124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The ion translocating function of the L-type channel is conferred by its pore forming Œ±1 subunit that contains four homologous repeats, each having six putative transmembrane segments (S1‚ÄìS6) (1.Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 493-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 2.Tsien R.W. Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). At least four subtypes have been identified and ascribed to coding gene differences; Œ±1C, Œ±1D, Œ±1F, and Œ±1S correspond to cardiac muscle, neuroendocrine tissue, retina, and skeletal muscle, respectively. The diversity of the channel is further generated by alternative splicing into various isoforms, as is the case for the Œ±1C subunit (5.Perez-Reyes E. Wei X.Y. Castellano A. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20430-20436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). L-type VSCCs have been identified in osteoblasts of various origins (6.Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13168-13173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Barry E.L.R. Gesek F.A.

Nephrol. 1998; 18: 178-190PubMed Google Scholar), where they are thought to play important roles in regulating osteoblast responses to external stimuli. In particular, L-type VSCCs transduce the rapid effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and depolarization, leading to Ca2+ influx in various osteoblastic cells (6.Caffrey J.M. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20265-20274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Lieberherr M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13168-13173Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Yukihiro S. Posner G.H. Guggino S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23889-23893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the longer term, 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment alters gene expression in osteoblastic cells, resulting in increased expression of matrix proteins including osteopontin and osteocalcin and reduced expression of the VSCC Œ±1C subunit (11.Meszaros J.G. Karin N.J. Akanbi K. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32981-32985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12.Norman A.W. Nemere I. Zhou L-X. Bishop J.E.

However, the molecular identity of the VSCC involved in Ca2+ flux induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 and depolarization has never been demonstrated conclusively. Recent developments in ribozyme technology provide powerful means to selectively inhibit expression of specific target genes. Ribozymes are a class of small catalytic RNA molecules that recognize specific substrate RNA molecules by their complementary nucleotide sequence, cleaving the substrate RNA as an endoribonuclease at enzymatic rates (13.Haseloff J. Gerlach W.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Ribozyme expression in transfected target cells thus can inhibit the functional expression of a specific gene. Factors that contribute to ribozyme efficiency in transfected cells are expression levels, stability against rapid degradation, correct folding for exposure to the target, and co-localization and processing at sites where target transcripts are produced and accumulated. By all of these criteria, the U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) expression cassette provides an excellent vehicle for ribozyme delivery and expression (14.Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar, 15.Skuzeski J.M. Lund E. Murphy J.T. Steinberg T.H. Burgess R.R. Dahlberg J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8345-8352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Montgomery R.A. Dietz H.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This cassette has been successfully used to introduce a ribozyme to inhibit fibrillin 1 expression in a human osteosarcoma cell line (16.Montgomery R.A. Dietz H.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). U1 snRNA is a highly expressed, stable small RNA (164 nucleotides) involved in both spliceosome and catalytic processing during pre-mRNA splicing (14.Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). The U1 snRNA expression cassette has potent, constitutive upstream elements comparable in strength with the SV40 early promoter (15.Skuzeski J.M. Lund E. Murphy J.T. Steinberg T.H. Burgess R.R. Dahlberg J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8345-8352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the 5‚Ä≤-end, there is a trimethylguanosine 5‚Ä≤ cap. At both ends, there are stable stem-loop structures, with the 3‚Ä≤ loop having a high GC content. These structures confer resistance to exonucleases (14.Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). U1 snRNA has a conserved binding site, referred to as the Sm binding site, for the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins. The consensus sequence is RAU3‚Äì4NUGR. The hypermethylation of the 5‚Ä≤ cap structure and the binding to the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein enable U1 snRNA to accumulate in the nucleoplasm, where the newly transcribed Œ±1C mRNA molecules are most abundant (14.Green M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 559-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In consideration of these advantages of the U1 snRNA expression cassette, the ribozyme vehicle used in these studies was derived from an engineered U1 snRNA expression vector (16.Montgomery R.A. Dietz H.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), maintaining the conserved Sm binding sequence AAUUUGUGG. This study was designed with the aim of producing a hammerhead ribozyme specifically targeting the Œ±1C subtype of the L-type VSCC, transfecting it into ROS 17/2.8 cells in the snRNA expression cassette, and determining whether efficient ablation of the Œ±1C transcript would reduce or eliminate Ca2+influx stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 or depolarization. Our results provide conclusive evidence that the cardiac subtype of the L-type VSCC present in osteoblastic cells, including ROS 17/2.8 cells and primary cultures, can serve as the major plasma membrane transducer of external stimuli including both 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated and depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx. For selecting and testing ribozyme activityin vitro, a cDNA copy of partial Œ±1CmRNA was ligated into pGEM¬Æ-3Z vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Total RNA was extracted from cultured ROS 17/2.8 cells with RNA STAT-60TM (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). The upstream primer CCC1 (5‚Ä≤-GGTAATCACCCGAAGGAGCAAG-3‚Ä≤) in the untranslated region and the downstream primer CCC3 (5‚Ä≤-ATGAATTCGCGTTGGGGTGGAAGAGTAGTC-3‚Ä≤; ATGAATTC represents an extra modified sequence) in the open reading frame were selected to amplify a 734-base pair fragment corresponding to bases ‚àí160 to 566 of the rat Œ±1C subtype. cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (RT) and random hexamer priming (AdvantageTMRT for PCR Kit, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were performed as follows: 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 ¬∞C, 1 min at 55 or 65 ¬∞C, and 2 min at 72 ¬∞C. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% (w/v) agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The 734-base pair amplimer was excised, extracted with the QIAEX II gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and ligated into a pGEM¬Æ-3Z vector. Subsequently, the ligated product was transformed into JM109 competent cells (Promega) for amplification. At least 10 colonies were selected, and the cloned DNA and ligation junctions were sequenced to verify the identity, sequence, and orientation of the insert. A ligated plasmid, termed pGEMŒ±1C7, was utilized to performin vitro transcription. pGEMŒ±1C7 contains an SP6 promoter upstream from the cloned DNA corresponding to Œ±1C mRNA of the L-type VSCC. The DNA sequence encoding Œ±1C transcript between primers CCC1 and CCC3 in rat ROS 17/2.8 cells was aligned and compared with other rat subtypes of VSCC Œ±1 subunits, including Œ±1S(GenBankTM accession no. X05921), Œ±1D(GenBankTM accession no. M57682), and reported sequence for Œ±1C (GenBankTM accession no. M67516). The computer program Align Plus (Scientific and Educational Software, State Line, PA) was used for sequence analysis and identification of subtype-specific sequences (see Fig. 1). A search for the nucleotide triplet NUX was made (where N is any nucleotide, andX is A, U, or C). NUX represents the cleavage triplet of hammerhead ribozymes (17.Ruffner D.E. Stormo G.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10695-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 18.Koizumi M. Hayase Y. Iwai S. Kamiya H. Inoue H. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7059-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The secondary RNA structure was then analyzed using the RNA MFold program (by Mike Zuker; available on the World Wide Web). Sites buried within complex predicted secondary structures were eliminated from consideration (19.Christoffersen R.E. McSwiggen J. Konings D. J. Mol. Struct. 1994; 311: 273-284Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar), and a site at nt 6 was selected for this study. The target sequence (25 nt) of ribozyme 6 was compared with available sequences in GenBankTM and found to be unique to Œ±1C. A hammerhead ribozyme targeting Œ±1C mRNA was designed according to published procedures (13.Haseloff J. Gerlach W.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). The ribozyme contained a 24-nt hammerhead domain flanked by 10‚Äì12 nt complementary to the targeted region of the Œ±1C mRNA. To construct the ribozymes in vitro, two strands of DNA template containing a SP6 RNA polymerase promoter sequence and ribozyme sequence were synthesized. The ribozyme was targeted to a GUC at nt 6 of Œ±1C mRNA, relative to the translational site, and was thus named ribozyme 6. The ribozyme-encoding oligonucleotides were incubated in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 50 mm NaCl at 94 ¬∞C for 5 min and then cooled gradually to room temperature to allow annealing into double-stranded DNA. Substrate RNA was synthesized from pGEMŒ±1C7 that contains a SP6 promoter upstream from the cloned DNA corresponding to partial Œ±1C mRNA. The plasmid pGEMŒ±1C7 was linearized with SacI and then isolated from an agarose gel and extracted using the QIAEX II gel extraction kit. Transcription of substrate and ribozyme RNA was performed with the RiboMAXTMlarge scale RNA production system (Promega). The transcription reaction mixture contained 2.5 Œºg of linearized plasmid or 1.5 Œºg of ribozyme DNA templates and 25 mm each ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP. In addition, a prescribed amount of SP6 RNA polymerase and buffers was added as suggested by the manufacturer's instructions in a total volume of 100 Œºl. Following transcription, the DNA templates were removed from the reaction mixture with RQ1-RNase-Free DNase. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed from the RNA transcript by size exclusion chromatography through a small prepacked MicroSpinTM G-50 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The target RNA and ribozyme 6 were mixed, and the in vitrocleavage reaction was performed in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 20 mm MgCl2 at 37 ¬∞C for various times. Prior to the addition of MgCl2, the mixture was heated at 95 ¬∞C for 2 min and then quick chilled on ice. The cleavage reaction was terminated by the addition of a 3-fold (v/v) excess of Ambion (Austin, TX) loading buffer containing formaldehyde, formamide, and 6 mm EDTA. Cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1.9% (w/v) agarose/formaldehyde gels and then stained with ethidium bromide and visualized after destaining with RNase-free water. The Œ±1C ribozyme used for transfection was designed and modified from the ribozyme tested in vitro. The vector for expressing this ribozyme in transfected cells was constructed from the plasmid pZeoU1EcoSpe (16.Montgomery R.A. Dietz H.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 519-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). pZeoU1EcoSpe contains the pZeoSV plasmid DNA modified by excising the SV40 promoter, SV40 polyadenylation site, and polylinker at the BamHI sites. In constructing the pZeoU1EcoSpe, a U1 snRNA expression cassette in pUC13 (20.Manser T. Gesteland R.F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1981; 1: 117-125PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Zhuang Y. Weiner A.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 827-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) was excised with BamHI digestion and ligated into the BamHI sites of the modified pZeoSV. Two rounds of site-directed mutagenesis were then performed to change 4 nt flanking the Sm protein binding site of U1 snRNA, creating uniqueEcoRI and SpeI restriction sites. The 5‚Ä≤-flanking region of the inserted U1 snRNA expression cassette possesses a promoter/enhancer comparable in strength with the SV40 early promoter (15.Skuzeski J.M. Lund E. Murphy J.T. Steinberg T.H. Burgess R.R. Dahlberg J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8345-8352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection vector expressing ribozyme 6 was termed pU1RBŒ±1C6, and the vector expressing the control RNA was designated pU1control. In construction of pU1RBŒ±1C6 and pU1control, the Sm binding sequence AATTTGTGG (AAUUUGUGG in mRNA) was inserted prior to the template DNA sequence. The DNA sequence of pU1control differs from that of pU1RBŒ±1C6 only in that the nucleotides corresponding to those in ribozyme 6 were randomly selected. Oligonucleotides were synthesized and chemically phosphorylated at the 5‚Ä≤-end (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA). The single-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated into the EcoRI and SpeI sites of pZeoU1EcoSpe to create pU1RBŒ±1C6 and pU1control. The sequence and orientation of the inserts as well as the U1 snRNA expression cassette were confirmed by DNA sequencing. ROS 17/2.8 rat osteoblastic sarcoma cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose (1:1) containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 ¬∞C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 as described previously (11.Meszaros J.G. Karin N.J. Akanbi K. Farach-Carson M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32981-32985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Zeocin-resistant clones, into which an anti-Œ±1C ribozyme construct or control plasmid had been transfected (see below) were maintained in the same medium supplemented with 50‚Äì150 Œºg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA). The cell lines were weaned from an initial selection concentration of 225 Œºg/ml (see below). pU1RBŒ±1C6 and pU1control were linearized with ApaI and cleaned with Wizard DNA Clean-Up Resin (Promega). ROS 17/2.8 cells were grown to 50‚Äì80% confluency and transfected with the linearized plasmids. Transfections were performed with LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At 72 h post-transfection, the cells were passaged to less than 25% confluency in medium containing 225 Œºg/ml Zeocin. After 14 days, widely spaced clonal colonies were scraped and aspirated into a micropipettor as described (22.Karin N.J. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 681-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The cell clumps were added to wells containing 0.15 ml of trypsin EDTA (22.Karin N.J. BioTechniques. 1999; 27: 681-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). After 15 min, the cell clumps were dispersed by pipetting, and the trypsin reaction was terminated with 1 ml of medium containing 10% (v/v) serum and 225 Œºg/ml Zeocin. The medium was replaced with fresh medium after the cells had attached firmly. To ensure plasmid retention, the Zeocin concentration was maintained at 50‚Äì150 Œºg/ml throughout all remaining phases of experimentation. Total RNA extraction and reverse transcription with random hexamer were performed as described above. For detection of ribozyme expression, PCR was performed with primers PRŒ±1C6 (5‚Ä≤-CATTCTGATGAGTCCGTGAGG-3‚Ä≤) and PRU1 (5‚Ä≤-GGAAAGCGCGAACGCAGT-3‚Ä≤). For detection of control plasmid expression, a nucleotide sequence termed PRcntr (5‚Ä≤-GCAGTTGACCGAAGAGTTGGA-3‚Ä≤) was used with PRU1. The amplification conditions were as follows: 45 s at 95 ¬∞C, 45 s at 58 ¬∞C, and 45 s at 72 ¬∞C for 30‚Äì35 cycles. PCR products were electrophoresed in 1.4% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. For detection of the mRNA encoding Œ±1C, PCR was performed with primers CCC1 and CCC3 as described above. PCR also was performed with a downstream primer pair near the 3‚Ä≤-end used previously in our laboratory (23.Meszaros J.G. Karin N.J. Farach-Carson M.C. Connect. Tissue Res. 1996; 35: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and termed PR11 (5‚Ä≤-AGAACCAGAGACAATGTGTGGAATA-3‚Ä≤) and PR12 (5‚Ä≤-TACAGGCTAGCATGATATCTTGCCA-3‚Ä≤). Cells were grown overnight, rinsed with Hanks' balanced salt solution three times, and fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Fixed cells were blocked for 20 min with blocking solution (1% gelatin, 0.05% casein, and 0.2% donkey serum) and then rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Commercial rabbit anti-Œ±1Cprimary antibodies that do not react with either Œ±1S or Œ±1D subtypes (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) were applied at a dilution of 1:500 in blocking solution for 1 h. A second antibody solution containing donkey anti-rabbit Ig-Texas Red (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a dilution of 1:10 in blocking solution was applied for 1 h. Prior to visualization, the cells were rinsed three times in buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) gelatin and 0.05% (w/v) casein for 10 min each. Finally, the cells were prepared with Fluoromount G (Fisher) and observed with a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) as described previously (24.French M.M. Smith S.E. Akanbi K. Sanford T. Hecht J. Farach-Carson M.C. Carson D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1103-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). It should be noted that Western blot analyses using a variety of osteoblastic cells confirm the specificity of the Œ±1Cantibody. 2K. Brubaker and R. Duncan, personal communication. Cultured cells were assayed for Ca2+ uptake using previously published procedures (25.Meszaros J.G. Farach-Carson M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 282: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 50,000 cells/ml onto 3.5-cm dishes and grown to approximately 50% confluency. Culture medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with resting buffer (132 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mmMgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Then the cells were incubated for 2 min with either 37 ¬∞C or room temperature resting buffer, resting buffer plus 1 nm 1,25(OH)2D3, or depolarizing buffer (5 mm NaCl, 132 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 10 mmd-glucose, and 25 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4). 1,25(OH)2D3 from stock solution (1 Œºm) in absolute ethanol was added into the resting buffer, and the same amount of ethanol was added into all other test tubes. All uptake solutions contained 12.5 ŒºCi/ml45Ca2+ (NEN Life Science Products). Uptake was terminated by aspiration of the labeling solution followed by three washes with ice-cold resting buffer. Cell-associated45Ca2+ was extracted by a 2-h incubation with 0.5 n NaOH and measured by liquid scintillation counting. Two-tailed t tests were performed to assess the significance of the difference between each stimulated group compared with its control in resting buffer. The first objective was to verify the sequence of Œ±1C transcript produced in ROS 17/2.8 cells for identification of ribozyme cleavage sites. The cDNA corresponding to the 5‚Ä≤ region of Œ±1C in ROS 17/2.8 cells that encompasses the initiating AUG codon was cloned and sequenced. This region was chosen for ribozyme targeting because the mRNA near the translational start site is more likely to be exposed on the outer surface of the three-dimensional structure of the folded transcript. Only a few nucleotide discrepancies upstream of the translational start site were found in a comparison of the Œ±1C mRNA from ROS 17/2.8 osteoblastic sarcoma cells with the Œ±1C mRNA sequence in GenBankTM(26.Snutch T.P. Tomlinson W.J. Leonard J.P. Gilbert M.M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 45-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar); the coding sequences were identical. For selection of subtype-specific ribozyme cleavage sites in the Œ±1CmRNA in ROS 17/2.8 cells, the mRNA sequence of Œ±1C mRNA was compared with those of Œ±1Dfrom rat brain mRNA (27.Hui A. Ellinor P.T. Krizanova O. Wang J.-J. Diebold R.J. Schwartz A. Neuron. 1991; 7: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and Œ±1S from rabbit skeletal muscle mRNA (28.Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) obtained from GenBankTM. No corresponding rat sequence of Œ±1S was found in the GenBankTM data base. Both K cat andK cat/K m for GUC and CUC cleavage sites are comparatively higher than for other potential sites. Because Œ±1C mRNA is not an abundant transcript in ROS 17/2.8 cells, both K cat andK m were considered (29.Birikh K.R. Heaton P.A. Eckstein F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). GUC at nt 6, relative to the translational site of Œ±1C, was selected as the best potential ribozyme target site. Fig. 1shows the design and specificity of the ribozyme that was termed ribozyme 6. MFold program analysis of the Œ±1C transcript further showed that the ribozyme 6 cleavage site was likely to be in a region of the predicted folded structure accessible for efficient ribozyme cleavage (Fig.2 A). To assess the ability of ribozyme 6 to cleave the Œ±1C transcript, reactions were performedin vitro with cloned products. To create a synthetic Œ±1C mRNA substrate, a region of Œ±1CmRNA that encompasses the selected subtype-specific target sites was inserted into the pGEM3 vector. This vector contains a SP6 promoter directly upstream of the cloned Œ±1C cDNA that corresponds to nt ‚àí160 to 566 relative to the translational start site. Transcription of the sense RNA construct by SP6 RNA polymerase yielded a 783-nt RNA substrate that contains 726 nt from the Œ±1C mRNA, plus 57 nt at the ends (46 plus 11 nts) contributed by the pGEM3 vector. Ribozyme 6 was synthesized from double-stranded synthetic DNA oligonucleotide as described (30.Gaur R.K. Krupp G. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 74: 69-78PubMed Google Scholar). The synthetic Œ±1C mRNA substrate and ribozyme were mixed as described in the legend to Fig. 2 B. Cleavage was assessed after various incubation times in the cell-free system. As shown in Fig. 2 B, cleavage of the Œ±1C target by ribozyme 6 occurred efficiently within the first 1.5 h (lane 3). The 783-base substrate was cleaved by ribozyme 6 into limit 571-base and 212-base fragments that appeared to be fairly stable for at least 6 h. Two other ribozymes targeting Œ±1C sites were also designed and cloned (data not shown). Ribozyme 6 was the most efficient, consistent with its target being located in the proximity of the start site. Ribozyme 6 and control double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides were inserted separately into a modified U1 snRNA expression vector as described under ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures.‚Äù The predicted secondary structures of both transcripts of U1-ribozyme and U1-control chimeric RNA were compared with the parent U1 snRNA using the RNA MFold program. As shown in Fig. 3, the U1-ribozyme 6 chimeric transcript was predicted to preserve the 5‚Ä≤ and 3‚Ä≤ stem-loop structures of U1 snRNA. The Sm binding site (AAUUUGUGG) of U1-ribozyme also is predicted to maintain its single-stranded character seen in U1 snRNA. While these models do not necessarily reflect the actual structure of the RNA molecules under study, they provide useful models for the design of active ribozymes. The ribozyme-encoding and control plasmids were transfected into ROS17/2.8 cells using LipofectAMINETM and subcloned as described under ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures.‚Äù Multiple, stable, and Zeocin-resistant clones transfected with ribozyme 6 were screened for Œ±1C mRNA expression by RT-PCR analysis. The clone that demonstrated the most efficient ablation of Œ±1CmRNA as revealed by PCR was selected for further study. For detecting the transcripts of U1-ribozyme and U1-control chimeric genes, specific primers were designed as described under ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures.‚Äù The RT-PCR analysis shown in Fig.4 demonstrates that ribozyme 6 was expressed only in the selected clonal cells transfected with ribozyme 6-encoding plasmids, while control ribozyme transcripts were found only in clonal cells transfected with control plasmids. As expected, both ribozyme and control transcripts were absent in the parental ROS 17/2.8 cells. The cDNA bands migrate at a size corresponding to the expected 66 base pairs, demonstrating that the ribozyme and control RNA constructs were expressed in the respective clonal cells. Selected clonal cells were analyzed by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy for Œ±1C transcript and protein expression. As shown in Fig. 5, the Œ±1C mRNA levels were strikingly reduced in cell lines transfected with ribozyme-encoding plasmids, while the Œ±1C mRNA levels in cell li"

The ability of CRP to bind specific DNA sequences and stimulate transcription is achieved as result of binding of an allosteric ligand: cAMP. Stopped-flow fluorimetry was employed to study the kinetics of the conformational changes in CRP induced by cAMP binding to high and low affinity receptor sites. Results of experiments using CRP labeled at Cys-178 with 1,5-I-AENS indicate change in conformation of the helix-turn-helix, occurring after the formation of CRP-cAMP2 complex, i.e. after saturation of the high affinity sites.

Results of experiments monitored using CRP intrinsic fluorescence suggest that conformational change precedes the formation of CRP-cAMP4 complex and results from displacement of equilibrium between two forms of CRP-cAMP2, caused by binding of cAMP to low affinity sites of one of these forms only.

Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein is a homodimer, composed of 209 amino acid residues per monomer, and each subunit is folded in two domains (2.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). The larger N-terminal domain contains a binding site for cAMP in anti conformation and is responsible for the dimer stability. The smaller C-terminal domain contains the HTH motif, responsible for DNA recognition and binding. The two domains are connected with a short hinge region (residues 135‚Äì138). A recent crystal structure of CRP-DNA complex showed, that each protein subunit binds two cAMP molecules (3.Passner J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2843-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In addition to previously known binding site, located in the N-terminal domain, there is a new site located between the hinge and the turn of HTH, which binds cAMP in the syn conformation. Several biochemical and biophysical properties of CRP exhibit a bimodal dependence on cAMP concentration (4.Heyduk T. Lee J.C. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6914-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This has been interpreted as evidence for existence of three conformational states of the protein, namely: unliganded CRP, CRP-cAMP1 with one cAMP bound to ananti site, and CRP-cAMP2 with bothanti sites filled. Basing on their most recent crystal structure, Passner and Steitz (3.Passner J.M. Steitz T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2843-2847Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) reinterpreted those results in terms of three conformational states represented by CRP, CRP-cAMP2 with cAMP bound to two anti sites, and CRP-cAMP4 with both two anti and twosyn sites filled. In presence of ‚àº100 Œºm [cAMP], CRP becomes ‚Äúactivated‚Äù and is able to recognize and bind specific DNA sequences and stimulate transcription (5.Taniguchi T. O'Neill M. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5090-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Crystallographic (2.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) and equilibrium dialysis studies (6.Takahashi M. Blazy B. Baudras A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5124-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) indicate that the ‚Äúactive‚Äù form of the protein is represented by CRP-cAMP2 complex, with twoanti sites filled. However, in the presence of millimolar concentrations of cAMP, where CRP-cAMP4 complex predominates, there is a loss in affinity and sequence specificity in DNA binding and consequently loss in transcription stimulation (7.Mukhopadhyay J. Sur R. Parrack P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This strongly suggests that the saturation of syn sites is causing protein ‚Äúdeactivation.‚Äù Previous biochemical and biophysical studies were focused on the identification of structural changes accompanying binding of cAMP to CRP, as well as on the determination what specific residues are involved in effecting observed transitions (reviewed in Ref. 1.Kolb A. Busby S. Buc H. Garges S. Adhya S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 749-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of those studies enabled identification of the mechanism, underlying the observed allosteric changes, in terms of KNF or MWC models. This paper presents the results of kinetic investigations of cAMP-induced conformational changes in CRP. Presented results provide evidence that allosteric ‚Äúactivation‚Äù of CRP at micromolar cAMP concentrations, occurs according to sequential (KNF) model, while conformational change observed at millimolar concentrations of cAMP, occurs according to concerted (MWC) model. 1,5-I-AENS, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, EDTA, and Tris were purchased from Sigma. DTT, cAMP, and cGMP were either from Sigma or Fluka. The Fractogel EMD SO3‚àí 650 (M) was from Merck; Q Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephadex G-25 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The nutrients for bacterial growth were either from Difco Laboratories or Life Sciences. All other chemicals were analytical grade products from POCh-Gliwice. All measurements were performed in buffers prepared in water purified by a Millipore system. CRP wild-type (wt) was isolated fromE. coli strain SA500 containing the plasmid pHA7, which encodes the crp gene (8.Aiba H. Fujimoto S. Ozaki N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1345-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The plasmid pHA7 was a generous gift from Dr. S. Garges. Tryptophan (Trp) at position 13 or 85 of CRP was replaced by phenylalanine with the use of pHA7 plasmid. The mutagenesis was performed using overlap extension method withPwo DNA polymerase. Plasmids encoding mutant crpgenes were introduced into E. coli strain M182Œîcrp, kindly provided by Dr. S. Busby. Bacteria were grown on Terrific broth at 37 ¬∞C overnight, in a Biostat B fermentor from Braun, Germany, and then harvested by centrifugation. CRP wt and mutants were purified at 4 ¬∞C, as described previously (9.Ma≈Çecki J. Wasylewski Z. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 660-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), with some important modifications. The cells were disrupted only by sonification using six 30-s pulse bursts, and the cell debris were removed by centrifugation. The crude extract was loaded onto a column filled with Fractogel EMD SO3‚àí, equilibrated with buffer: 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the column was washed overnight. Proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of NaCl (0‚Äì1.0 m) in same buffer, and under such conditions CRP was eluted at about 0.7m NaCl. Fractions containing CRP were pooled, dialyzed against buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 (at 20 ¬∞C), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 5% glycerol, and passed through a column filled with Q Sepharose, equilibrated with same buffer. The protein was collected in the void volume, dialyzed, and stored in aliquots at ‚àí20 ¬∞C. After this two-step procedure, the protein was highly pure (>97%), as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. All measurements were performed in buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9 (at 20 ¬∞C), 100 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA). Before measurements the protein aliquots stored at ‚àí20 ¬∞C were withdrawn, thawed on ice, and dialyzed extensively against buffer A to remove DTT and glycerol. Before measurements all samples were filtered through a microporous filter (0.45 Œºm) to remove all undissolved impurities. The concentration of protein, cyclic nucleotides, and fluorescence probe was determined by absorption spectroscopy using the following extinction coefficients: 40,800m‚àí1 cm‚àí1 at 278 nm for CRP wt dimer (6.Takahashi M. Blazy B. Baudras A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5124-5130Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), 14,650 m‚àí1 cm‚àí1 at 259 nm and 12,950 m‚àí1 cm‚àí1 at 254 nm for cAMP and cGMP (10.Merck Co Inc The Merck Index. 9th Ed. Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ1976: 353Google Scholar), respectively, and 6000m‚àí1 cm‚àí1 at 340 nm for AENS group (11.Hudson E.N. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1973; 12: 4154-4161Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients of CRP mutants were determined using the method described elsewhere (12.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar) and were 29,700m‚àí1 cm‚àí1 and 33,100m‚àí1 cm‚àí1 at 278 nm for W85F and W13F dimers, respectively. CRP wt was covalently labeled with 1,5-I-AENS using the procedure described elsewhere (13.Wu F.Y.-H. Nath K. Wu C.-W. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2567-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), with some minor modifications. Protein and label were mixed at molar ratio 1:20 and incubated at 4 ¬∞C in buffer A, overnight at dark. Labeled CRP was purified by Sephadex G-25 column and dialyzed extensively against buffer A. The stoichiometry of labeling was determined by absorption spectroscopy and was in the range of 2.2‚Äì2.6 mol of label/mol of CRP dimer. Kinetic measurements were performed at 20 ¬∞C (¬± 0.2 ¬∞C) using a stopped-flow spectrafluorimeter SX-17 MV from Applied Photophysics, United Kingdom. The dead time of mixing was determined to be less than 2 ms. Changes in the protein conformation induced by cAMP binding were monitored using two methods: 1) fluorescence intensity of AENS-CRP, observed through a green filter at wavelengths between 420 and 650 nm, after excitation at 340 nm and 2) fluorescence intensity of tryptophan (Trp) residues, observed through a cut-off filter at wavelengths >320 nm, after excitation at 295 nm. Trp fluorescence intensity was corrected for the inner filter effect, introduced by cAMP at the excitation wavelength, according to the following formula (14.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar). Fcor=F√ó10P+ŒîA2Equation 1 F and F cor are fluorescence intensity before and after the correction, whereas P and ŒîA denote the initial sample absorption at the excitation wavelength and the change in absorption introduced by the ligand. In a typical series of experiments, the protein at fixed concentration was stopped-flow mixed with cAMP of various concentrations (mixing ratio 1:1). In experiments where AENS-CRP was used, its final concentration was 0.35 Œºm. In experiments where Trp fluorescence detection was used, protein final concentration was 2 Œºm. Between 10 and 14 kinetic traces were averaged routinely for each experiment. Such averaged kinetic traces were fit to a single exponential or a sum of such terms. F(t)=Aexp(‚àíkt)+CEquation 2 F is the fluorescence intensity at time t,A and k are the amplitude and the observed rate constant, and C is the fluorescence at infinite time, respectively. The software for analysis of kinetic traces was from Applied Photophysics. At micromolar cAMP concentrations, CRP undergoes a conformational change according to sequential (KNF) model of allostery (see ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù). This can be represented by the scheme shown by Reactions 1 and 2 and Equation 3.

At millimolar cAMP concentrations, CRP undergoes a conformational change according to concerted (MWC) model of allostery (see ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù), which can be represented by the scheme shown by Reactions 3 and 4 and Equation 6.

After excitation at 340 nm, the AENS-CRP emits a characteristic fluorescence with a maximum set at about 490 nm. Addition to the solution of 100 Œºm [cAMP] causes about 20% increase in the fluorescence intensity of AENS-CRP and concomitant blue shift in the emission maximum by about 10 nm. A further increase in [cAMP] to millimolar levels does not change the fluorescence characteristics of the labeled protein. When AENS-CRP is stopped-flow mixed with cAMP of various concentrations, a characteristic increase in the fluorescence intensity of the label is observed (Fig. 1). The obtained kinetic traces were fit to a single exponential or a sum of such terms (Equation 2). In all cases the data were satisfactorily described by a single exponential, while double exponential fitting did not improve the goodness of the fit. The rates obtained from fitting of AENS-CRP fluorescence detected kinetic traces to single exponential were plotted against the final cAMP concentration and the resulting graph is presented in Fig.2, while the corresponding amplitudes are presented in Fig. 3. As the total cAMP concentration increases, the observed rate (k obs) also increases. For ligand concentrations below 40 Œºm, an approximate linear dependence ofk obs on [cAMP] is observed. Above 40 Œºm [cAMP], the k obs deviates from linearity and approaches a constant value at very high (millimolar) concentrations of cAMP. Such behavior indicates a sequential two-step mechanism, where the process of conformational change is consecutive versus the ligand-binding step. Previous studies indicate that the association of cAMP to CRP is a very fast process (15.Wu C.-W. Wu F.Y.-H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that the observed change in the fluorescence intensity of AENS-CRP results from conformational change of the double liganded protein, i.e.: CRP-cAMP2(Equation 3 and Reactions 1 and 2).Figure 3Dependence of the amplitudes of cAMP-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity of AENS-CRP , on the final cAMP concentration, derived from kinetic (‚óã) and equilibrium (‚ñ†) measurements. The solid line denotes the best fit of data to Equation 5. The parameters of the fit are summarized in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) From the dependence of k obs on cAMP concentration, it is possible to evaluate the rate constants that describe the conformational change step and the average dissociation constant for cAMP binding to high affinity sites of CRP (Equation 4). The following values of the fitted parameters were obtained:kc = 9.7 ¬± 0.1 s‚àí1,k-c = 0.31 ¬± 0.05 s‚àí1, andKanti = 27.5 ¬± 1 Œºm (TableI). The above values enable to calculate the equilibrium constant between CRP-cAMP2 before and after the conformational change, which is KC = 0.032. Such low value of KC indicates that, in equilibrium, most of the double liganded CRP will undergo the conformational change.Table IKinetic and thermodynamic parameters describing cAMP binding to high affinity sites of CRP wtProteink ck ‚àícK CK antis ‚àí1s ‚àí1ŒºmCRP wt9.7 ¬± 0.1aObtained from rate-based analysis of kinetic data.0.31 ¬± 0.05aObtained from rate-based analysis of kinetic data.0.032 (0.029, 0.044)aObtained from rate-based analysis of kinetic data.27.5 ¬± 1.0aObtained from rate-based analysis of kinetic data.0.2 ¬± 0.09bObtained from amplitude-based analysis of kinetic data.9.6 ¬± 2.3bObtained from amplitude-based analysis of kinetic data.0.019 ¬± 0.015cObtained from analysis of equilibrium data.26.5 ¬± 11.6cObtained from analysis of equilibrium data.The values presented are derived from experiments conducted at 20 ¬∞C, in buffer A, pH 7.9, using AENS-CRP fluorescence detection.

This corresponds well with another binding curve (Fig. 3), which represents cAMP-induced changes in the fluorescence intensity of AENS-CRP, obtained from equilibrium studies. Both sets of data were fit to Equation 5, and the best-fit parameters are summarized in Table I. Presented results are in good agreement with values obtained from rate-based analysis. However, the analysis of the amplitude-based data gives a slightly lower value of the average dissociation constantKanti = 9.6 ¬± 2.5 Œºm and a higher value of the equilibrium constant KC = 0.2 ¬± 0.09, comparing to rate-based data analysis. When CRP is stopped-flow mixed with cAMP at concentrations below 300 Œºm, only very small change in the fluorescence intensity of Trp residues can be detected. However, when CRP is mixed with cAMP of higher concentrations, a characteristic increase in the fluorescence intensity of Trp residues is observed (Fig. 4). The obtained kinetic traces were fit to a single exponential or a sum of such terms (Equation 2). In all cases studied, the data were satisfactorily described by a single exponential, while double exponential fitting did not improve the goodness of the fit. The rates obtained from fitting of Trp fluorescence detected kinetic traces were plotted against the final [cAMP] and the resulting plot is presented in Fig. 5. The corresponding amplitudes are shown in Fig. 6. As the total cAMP concentration increases, the observed rate (k obs) decreases, reaching a constant value at very high ligand concentrations. Such behavior is indicative of displacement of an equilibrium between two conformational states of the protein, caused by the binding of ligand to one of these forms only (Equation 6 and Reactions 3 and 4).Figure 6Dependence of the amplitudes associated with cAMP-induced changes in Trp fluorescence intensity of CRP wt (‚óã) and W13F mutant (‚ñ†), on the final cAMP concentration.

Wu F.Y.-H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2573-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), it can be assumed that P and P‚Ä≤ denote two interconvertible forms of CRP-cAMP2 complex (see ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù). Moreover, as the observed changes occur at millimolar [cAMP], they must be associated with binding of cAMP to low affinity sites of CRP, but not with cAMP binding to high affinity sites. In order to evaluate the rate constants of the conformational change associated with P to P‚Ä≤ transition, as well as the average dissociation constant for cAMP binding to low affinity sites of CRP, the rate dependence from Fig. 5 was fit to Equation 7. The following values of the fitted parameters were obtained: k on = 28 ¬± 1.5 s‚àí1, for the forward reaction,k off = 75.5 ¬± 3 s‚àí1 for the backward reaction, and Ksyn = 2.0 ¬± 0.2 mm for the average dissociation constant of thesyn sites. From these values one can calculate the equilibrium constant between the two forms of CRP to be:K 0 = 2.7.

Fig. 6 shows the amplitudes obtained from Trp fluorescence-detected kinetic traces of cAMP binding to CRP. The resulting binding curve saturates at about 10 mm [cAMP], with a half-saturation point set at about 1.5 mm. These data were fit to Equation8, and the following values of the fitted parameters were obtained:Ksyn = 1.0 ¬± 0.2 mm andK 0 = 4.4 ¬± 1.1 (Table II). Trp fluorescence-detected stopped-flow kinetics was also employed to study cAMP binding to CRP-cAMP2 complex. In this case CRP was incubated at 200 Œºm [cAMP] for 1 h and subsequently stopped-flow mixed with cAMP of various concentrations. Additionally, in that case, the characteristic increase in the fluorescence intensity of Trp residues could be satisfactorily fit to a single exponential. The dependence of k obs on final cAMP concentration is virtually identical to that obtained for CRP in initial absence of the ligand (Fig. 5). When Equation 7 was used for fitting these data, the following values of the estimated parameters were obtained: k on = 28.5 ¬± 2.0 s‚àí1, k off = 85 ¬± 7.5 s‚àí1, and Ksyn = 1.8 ¬± 0.3 mm. From the values above, one can estimate the equilibrium constant between two interconvertible forms of CRP-cAMP2 to be K 0 = 3.0. This is exactly the same as obtained during kinetic experiments where unliganded CRP wt was used (Table II). Analogous fluorescence stopped-flow experiments using Trp fluorescence detection were performed using two single-tryptophan-containing CRP mutants: W85F and W13F. In case of CRP W85F, only very small decrease in intrinsic fluorescence intensity was observed at micromolar [cAMP]. However, a strong increase in Trp fluorescence at millimolar [cAMP] was observed in case of CRP W13F, and the obtained kinetic traces could be well described by a single-exponential. The dependence of k obs on cAMP concentration obtained for W13F mutant is shown in Fig. 5, while the corresponding amplitude dependence is presented in Fig. 6. Both the rate and amplitude dependences are similar to results obtained in case of CRP wt. The values of parameters: k on, k off,K 0, and Ksyn derived from fitting those data to Equations 7 and 8 are also quite similar between CRP wt and W13F mutant (Table II). The ultimate goal of conformational changes induced by cAMP binding to high affinity (anti) sites is to change CRP from a low affinity, nonspecific DNA-binding protein, to a transcription activator that binds DNA with high affinity and sequence specificity. According to present understanding of this phenomenon (2.Weber I.T. Steitz T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 311-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 16.Garges S. Adhya S. J.

Results presented here provide evidence for conformational changes occurring within the HTH motif. Each CRP subunit contains three cysteine residues (8.Aiba H. Fujimoto S. Ozaki N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 1345-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar); however, only Cys-178, which is located in the turn of the HTH motif, is solvent-accessible (4.Heyduk T. Lee J.C.

In this study we show that this is also true for Dictyostelium. In addition, XeC inhibited Ca(2+) uptake into purified vesicle fractions and induced Ca(2+) release. This suggests that, in the case of Dictyostelium, XeC opens rather than plugs the IP(3) receptor channel as was proposed for mammalian cells (Gafni, J., Munsch, J. A. , Lam, T. H., Catlin, M. C., Costa, L. G., Molinski, T. F., and Pessah, I. N. (1997) Neuron 19, 723-733). In order to elucidate the function of the XeC-sensitive Ca(2+) store in Dictyostelium during differentiation, we applied XeC to the cells and found that it caused a time-dependent increase of basal [Ca(2+)](i) and inhibited cAMP-induced Ca(2+) influx in single cells as well as in cell suspensions. Moreover, XeC blocked light scattering spikes and pulsatile cAMP signaling."

The natural diversity of biosynthesized conotoxin peptides has led to the classification of a wide spectrum of disulfide-bridged peptides, which attack various ligand and ion-gated channels and receptors (1.McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors exhibit considerable diversity in their own right because of the different compositions found in the pentameric subunits constituting each nAChR subtype (2.Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Although the mammalian neuromuscular subtype comprises (Œ±1)2Œ≤Œ≥Œ¥ or (Œ±1)2Œ≤ŒµŒ¥ subunits, the neuronal subtypes are comparatively more diverse with their hetero- or homopentameric combinations of Œ± (Œ±2 ‚àº Œ±9) or Œ≤ (Œ≤2 ‚àº Œ≤4) subunits (3.Sargent P.B.

For the case of Œ±-conotoxins, target selectivity is essentially defined depending on which subunit interface of the nAChR (e.g.Œ±1/Œ≥, Œ±1/Œ¥, and Œ±3/Œ≤2) each individual Œ±-conotoxin preferentially binds to (1.McIntosh J.M.

Highly selective Œ±-conotoxins that permit differential blocking of diverse nAChR subtypes have served as effective tools in studying these receptors (1.McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu.

These observations reaffirm that conotoxins are based on common three-dimensional scaffolds and that their subtype selectivity is conferred through sequence variation of a selected number of residues (5.Olivera B.M.

We hereby present the high-resolution solution structure of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB that has a unique Œ±3Œ≤4 nAChR subtype selectivity (6.Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D.

Œ±3Œ≤4-like receptors are believed to be important in peripheral ganglionic transmission and centrally mediated norepinephrine release. Œ±-Conotoxin AuIB inherently lacks Tyr15 found in other Œ±4/7 members such as Œ±-conotoxins PnIA, PnIB, EpI, and even AuIA and AuIC (Table I). Of the three Œ±-conotoxin AuIs found in Conus aulicus (6.Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Œ±-conotoxin AuIB is the best characterized from a functional standpoint and has thus been chosen for detailed structural analysis by NMR. Structural comparison of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB with other neuronal Œ±-conotoxins should provide useful insight into important nAChR subtype determinants, in particular, those that discriminate the Œ≤2 and Œ≤4 subunits. Œ±-Conotoxin AuIB was synthesized using solid-phase chemistry and purified to homogeneity as described previously (6.Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples for NMR studies were prepared in 90% H2O and 10% 2H2O or 100%2H2O, pH 4.1, with a final sample concentration of 6 mm. All NMR experiments were performed using a Varian UNITY INOVA 600 spectrometer at 278 and 298 K. Solvent suppression was carried out using selective, low-powered irradiation of the water resonance during a relaxation delay of 1.5 s. All resonances were referenced to a residual water signal (4.76 ppm at 298 K). Mixing times of 200‚Äì400 ms for NOESY and 150 ms for rotating frame NOESY experiments were used. For total correlation spectroscopy experiments (19.Griesinger C. Otting G. WuÃàthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1198) Google Scholar), a 75-ms mixing time was used.3 J HNHŒ± coupling constants for the backbone torsion angle were measured using phase-sensitive double-quantum-filtered two-dimensional COSY experiments (20.Rance M. Sorenson D.W. Bodenhausen G. Wagner G. Ernst R.R. WuÃàthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 117: 479-485Crossref Scopus (2596) Google Scholar). Primitive exclusive COSY (21.Mueller L. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 72: 191-196Google Scholar) was performed in 100%2H2O to measure the3 J Œ±Œ≤coupling constants, which were used in conjunction with the d NŒ≤ NOEs to provide œá1 torsion angles. Spectral widths were 7.0 kHz in both dimensions. Typical two-dimensional data consisted of 2048 complex points in the t 2 dimension and 256 complex t 1 increments. Data acquisition, sequential assignments, and spectral interpretation were performed on SPARCstation IPX and Ultra 1 Creator workstations (Sun Microsystems) running VnmrX 5.3B software (Varian Associates) Two-dimensional NMR data were processed using Felix 95.0 and Insight II 97.0 (Biosym/MSI) on Indigo2 xL or Indy workstations (Silicon Graphics). NOE interproton distance constraints were derived primarily from the NOESY spectrum obtained at 278K with a mixing time of 200 ms. Before Fourier transformation, free induction decays were reconstructed using linear prediction, apodized with a 60¬∞ sine bell-squared window function in both dimensions, and baseline corrected using the FLATT algorithm (22.GuÃàntert P. WuÃàthrich K. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 96: 403-407Google Scholar). NOE cross-peak volumes were measured and converted into upper bounds of interproton distances using the distance of 1.8 ‚Ñ´ as a reference for nonoverlapping geminal Œ≤-proton cross-peaks. Appropriate pseudoatom allowances of 1.5‚Äì2.5 ‚Ñ´ were given to constraints. Dihedral angle restraints were inferred from3 J HNHŒ±coupling constants and were centered on ‚àí120¬∞ ¬± 30¬∞ for3 J HNHŒ± > 8 Hz and ‚àí60¬∞ ¬± 30¬∞ for 3 J HNHŒ± < 6 Hz. Side chain œá1 torsion angles measured from primitive exclusive COSY experiments were also incorporated in combination with the sequential d Œ±Œ≤ NOE for stereospecifically assigned Œ≤-methylene protons. A total of 156, including 13 long-range and 25 medium-range, distance constraints, together with eight œÜ and two œá1 torsion angles were input for the computation of structures. Preliminary structures were generated using DGII (23.Havel T.F. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1991; 56: 43-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), NMRchitect, and Insight II 97.0. An extended molecule with two disulfide bridges and a formal charge of zero was constructed. The potentials and partial charges were assigned using the consistent valence force field (24.Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1947) Google Scholar) and used throughout the computations. Full relaxation matrix analysis using MARDIGRAS version 3.2 (25.Borgias B.A. James T.L. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 176: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) was performed on DGII-generated structures as initial model structures. The three-site jump model for intra- and inter-residue distances was chosen, and the noise level was estimated to be 50% of the un-normalized absolute value of the smallest peak. The rotational correlation time was estimated to be 1.0 ns. Structures were refined with restrained molecular dynamics calculations with Discover 2.9.7 (Biosym/MSI) and Insight II 95.0. A simulated annealing schedule based on well established protocols (26.Nilges M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar) was generated and run. The 68-ps protocol consisted of dynamics at 1000 K (50 ps), followed by gradual temperature cooling from 1000 to 300 K (incremental temperature decrease of 100 K each over 18 ps) with staggered geometric increases of NOE, covalent term, and nonbonded force constants. During the final dynamics step at 300 K and subsequent minimization steps, a modified restraint file with decreased force constants for side chain interproton distances was used to allow further conformational dynamics. Energy minimization was performed 2-fold, first with a quadratic potential and then with a Lennard-Jones nonbonded potential. A total of 50 simulated annealing rounds were run. The R a andR b factors (27.Thomas P.D. Basus V.J. James T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1237-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) were calculated using CORMA version 5.2 (28.Keepers J.W. James T.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1984; 57: 404-426Google Scholar) for the final ensemble of 20 structures. In addition, the stereochemistry of the computed structures were analyzed with PROCHECK version 3.5 (29.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The three-dimensional display of structures was performed either with Insight II 97.0 (Biosym/MSI) or GRASP version 1.3.6 (30.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The complete1H resonance assignment for Œ±-conotoxin AuIB was achieved in a straightforward manner using double-quantum-filtered two-dimensional COSY, total correlation spectroscopy, and NOESY and rotating frame NOESY spectra following the standard sequential assignment procedure (31.Billeter M. Braun W. WuÃàthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 155: 321-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Initial assignment of the amino acids was made along the NH resonances in double-quantum-filtered two-dimensional COSY and total correlation spectroscopy spectra. Apart from Thr11, where the HŒ± and HŒ≤ protons showed overlapping, all HŒ± and side chain protons were unambiguously resolved, permitting the tracing of sequential HŒ±-NH(i + 1) connectivities. The connectivity was broken at three proline residues (Pro6, Pro7, and Pro13), for which resonance assignment was achieved using strongd Œ±Œ¥(Tyr5, Pro6),d Œ±Œ¥(Pro6, Pro7), andd Œ±Œ¥(Asn12, Pro13) cross-peaks that indicate all prolines have the trans conformation. Fig. 1 is a summary of sequential and medium-range NOEs used for the resonance assignment, the3 J HNHŒ± values, the temperature coefficients for NH protons (ŒîŒ¥NH), and chemical shift indices (32.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). The stretches of d Œ±N(i, i + 3),d Œ±Œ≤(i, i + 3), andd Œ±N(i, i + 4) NOEs between Pro6and Asn12 makes the presence of an Œ±-helix evident before the detailed structure calculations. Fig. 2shows the superposition of a final ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures. The backbone and heavy atom RMSD values for the entire chain are 0.269 and 0.720 ‚Ñ´, respectively. Omitting the flexible N-terminal Gly1 residue, the backbone RMSD value improves considerably to 0.092 ‚Ñ´, with the heavy atom RMSD being 0.707 ‚Ñ´. As shown in Table II, overall structural statistics concerning experimental restraints, covalent geometry, and structural convergence for Œ±-conotoxin AuIB are extremely good. When subject to quality evaluation by PROCHECK (29.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), backbone dihedral angles of all non-Gly and non-Pro residues were found to reside within the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot (TableII).Table IINMR structure determination statistics of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB for an ensemble of 20 structuresRMS deviations from Experimental restraintsaValues are means ¬± S.D.

Open table in a new tab The backbone fold of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB has the shape of the Greek letter œâ, which is characteristic of all Œ±4/7 Œ±-conotoxins (Fig.3). The N-terminal Cys2-Tyr5 residues constitute a type I Œ≤-turn. This is followed by a two-turn Œ±-helix (Tyr5-Asn12), which forms the bottom portion of the œâ fold. The C terminus (Asn12-Cys15) forms a bend at Pro13 to properly complete the Cys3-Cys15 disulfide bridge. Of the two disulfide bridges present in Œ±-conotoxin AuIB, œá1angles for the Cys3-Cys15 pair were determined experimentally and used to calculate a left-handed spiral conformation. The final ensemble of the Cys2-Cys8 disulfide bridge also converged well to a single, left-handed form. These disulfide conformations are in good agreement with those observed in high-resolution x-ray structures of other Œ±4/7 members such as Œ±-conotoxins PnIA (12.Hu S.-H. Gehrmann J. Guddat L.W.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11425-11433Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the inherent absence of a tyrosine between Asp14 and Cys15 in Œ±-conotoxin AuIB does not influence the overall conformation of the Cys3-Cys15 disulfide bridge to any appreciable extent. However, this deletion renders the local backbone fold near Asp14 and Cys15 in Œ±-conotoxin AuIB noticeably different from that in other Œ±4/7 members (see Fig.5 A). Two consecutive Œ≤ turns found at their C termini of other Œ±4/7 members are absent in Œ±-conotoxin AuIB.Figure 5Structural comparison between Œ±-conotoxins AuIB (green) and MII (blue).

The viewing direction differs by 90¬∞ from A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Œ±4/7 subfamily of Œ±-conotoxins share a common œâ backbone fold, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. The pairwise backbone RMSDs of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB with other Œ±4/7 members are 0.97 ‚Ñ´ with MII (Protein Data Bank file name, 1M2C), 0.61 ‚Ñ´ with PnIA (1PEN), 0.70 ‚Ñ´ with PnIB (1AKG), and 0.52 ‚Ñ´ with [Tyr15]EpI (1A0M). A common backbone scaffold shared by the Œ±4/7 members would presumably provide an efficient means for combinatorial presentation of functional side chain moieties that specifically interact with the receptor (5.Olivera B.M. Hillyard D.R. Marsh M. Yoshikami D. Trends Biotechnol. 1995; 13: 422-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, when excluding the neuromuscular-targeting Œ±-conotoxin EI, the N-terminal disulfide loop of all Œ±4/7 subfamily members contains an SŒΩP(P/V) sequence (ŒΩ is a variable residue) except for Œ±-conotoxin EpI, which is not particularly specific for one subtype. Ligand binding to the Œ± subunit of nAChR is known to be primarily mediated by hydrophobic aromatic interactions (33.Sugiyama N. Marchot P. Kawanishi C. Osaka H. Molles B. Sine S.M. Taylor P. Mol. Pharamacol. 1998; 53: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 34.Chiara D.C. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32940-32950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35.Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar). Surface characteristics of the putative SŒΩP(P/V) region in Œ±4/7 Œ±-conotoxins shown below by GRASP suggest that the mostly hydrophobic SŒΩP(P/V) sequence may represent a common Œ±3 subunit recognition face in neuronal Œ±4/7 members. The variability in sequence across the C-terminal seven-residue loop is greater, in particular, for the first three residues. The amino acid types for the last four residues in the same loop can reasonably be represented by (P/S)(D/N)(Y/L)C. Because this C-terminal sequence is shared, it is unlikely that this region is responsible for the different nAChR subtype specificities exhibited by each toxin. For example, both Œ±-conotoxins AuIA and AuIC possess Tyr15(Table I), yet their Œ±3Œ≤4 subtype selectivity is only slightly weaker than Œ±-conotoxin AuIB (6.Luo S. Kulak J.M. Cartier G.E. Jacobsen R.B. Yoshikami D. Olivera B.M. McIntosh J.M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Gly14 in Œ±-conotoxin AuIC and the missing Tyr15 Œ±-conotoxin AuIB are not likely to be essential for defining the Œ±3Œ≤4 subtype selectivity. As noted above, the missing Tyr15 from the PDYC sequence in Œ±-conotoxin AuIB results in a different local backbone C-terminal fold from other Œ±4/7 members. Using Œ±-conotoxin PnIA as a reference, divergence in the Œ±-conotoxin AuIB backbone trace begins with Pro13, where the Pro rings of both Œ±-conotoxins PnIA and AuIB display perpendicular orientations. A strong backbone bend follows, placing the Asp14 CŒ± of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB closer to the Tyr15 CŒ± than the Asp14 CŒ± of Œ±-conotoxin PnIA (Fig. 3). It remains to be seen whether the observed spatial shift of the Asp14 side chain contributes to the higher antagonistic activity of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB than AuIA/C. Fig. 4 shows electrostatic potential surfaces generated by GRASP (30.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) for Œ±-conotoxins AuIB, PnIA, [Tyr15]EpI, and MII. The viewing direction is kept same as that in Fig. 3. The positively charged N terminus (upper left region) is observed for all four toxins. The upper right hydrophobic bulge corresponds to Tyr15 of Œ±-conotoxins PnIA and [Tyr15]EpI or Leu15in Œ±-conotoxin MII. Note that the negatively charged Asp14 of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB is found at the corresponding location. A deep cleft is observed in the left side of MII, but the corresponding site in Œ±-conotoxins AuIB and EpI is filled with Tyr5 and Asp5, respectively. The conspicuous hydrophobic bulge formed by Leu10 in the middle of MII is absent in other Œ±4/7 members, suggesting that Leu10 in MII is important for its Œ≤2 subunit selectivity (see below). Significance of the residue at position 10 in the Œ±4/7 subfamily is further illustrated by the following observation. Œ±-Conotoxins PnIA and PnIB differ in only two positions, yet their selectivities are markedly different (Table I). Interestingly, substituting Ala10 by Leu turns the Œ±3Œ≤2 subtype-specific PnIA into an Œ±7 subtype-specific toxin, suggesting that only position 10 is necessary to differentiate the two toxins (1.McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, more specific comparison can be made between two members of the Œ±4/7 subfamily, AuIB and MII, because the former is highly selective toward the Œ±3Œ≤4nAChR subtype, whereas the latter is selective for the Œ±3Œ≤2 subtype. MII is chosen as the Œ±3Œ≤2 subtype-specific toxin, because Œ±-conotoxin PnIA, another Œ±3Œ≤2-targeting toxin, is much less selective than Œ±-conotoxin MII toward the same receptor subtype (1.McIntosh J.M. Santos A.D. Olivera B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). At present, two different NMR structures of MII are available, one determined in aqueous solution (Ref. 15.Hill J.M. Oomen C.J. Miranda L.P. Bingham J.-P. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15621-15630Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar; 1M2C) and the other in 30% 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (Ref. 16.Hu S.-H. Loughnan M. Miller R. Weeks C.M. Blessing R.H. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Martin J.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11425-11433Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar; 1MII). Because the structure of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB was determined in aqueous solution without 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol, structural comparisons were made with the former. In fact, backbone comparisons of Œ±-conotoxin AuIB with both structures indicate that the former agrees better when superimposed (pairwise RMSDs, 0.97 ‚Ñ´ for 1M2C and 1.29 ‚Ñ´ for 1MII). Note in Fig. 5 A the aforementioned local backbone difference near residues 13‚Äì15 between Œ±-conotoxins MII and AuIB. This difference is also clearly visible when the structure of Œ±-conotoxin MII determined in 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol is used for comparison, because the structures of Œ±-conotoxin MII in two solvent conditions are essentially the same. If a comparative surface exposure approach previously used for Œ±-conotoxin EI3 is applied to compare the two toxins (Fig. 5 B), three residues of Œ±-conotoxin MII become exposed out of the AuIB surface, Leu10, Glu11, and His12. The former two were shown to be important for distinguishing neuromuscular from neuronal nAChR.3 Note that GRASP analysis above suggested Leu10 to be important for the Œ≤2 subunit selectivity of Œ±-conotoxin MII. The third residue, His12, is unique in that no other Œ±4/7 members have such an aromatic bulky residue at the same position (TableI). Intriguingly, His12 is buried underneath bulky side chains of Arg9 and His10 of neuromuscular Œ±-conotoxin GI and hence is not surface-exposed when Œ±-conotoxins GI and MII are superimposed.3 These results suggest that His12 in Œ±-conotoxin MII is important for distinguishing two different neuronal nAChR subtypes, Œ±3Œ≤4and Œ±3Œ≤2, but makes no contribution to discriminating the neuronal nAChR subtype against the neuromuscular subtype. The surface-exposed Ser13 of Œ±-conotoxin MII is not considered important, because it stays outside of the AuIB surface because of the different local backbone topology pointed out earlier. This residue is not exposed if Œ±-conotoxin MII is superimposed with other Œ±4/7 members such as PnIA/B or EpI. Rather interesting is that there are no prominently protruding AuIB residues out of the MII surface, except for the hydroxyl tip of Tyr5 and the carboxylate side chain of Asp14. An alanine-scanning study on Œ±-conotoxin AuIB should provide answers on the significance of these residues for the Œ≤4 subtype specificity. The structural details of Œ±-conotoxin binding with nAChR are currently incomplete. Despite the overall differences or local similarity among these toxins, it is certainly difficult to unambiguously define the respective subtype selectivities based only on such structural features (18.Mok K.H. Han K. Biochemisty. 1999; 38: 11895-11904Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Binding determinants within the Œ±4/7 subfamily are subtle and may not be immediately discernible, as can be judged from the fact that the overall structural fold is same, whereas only types of amino acids are varied. Hence, structural comparison of different Œ±-conotoxins needs to be augmented by additional information from site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric receptor engineering (3.Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 36.Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J.

Cumulative results support that both Œ± and non-Œ± subunits of the neuronal nAChR contribute to the binding of agonists and antagonists (38.Sine S.M. Claudio T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19369-19377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Pedersen S.E. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W2010971901,"CD1d is a member of the CD1 polypeptide family that represents a new arm of host defense against invading pathogens. In our previous work (Rodionov, D. G., Nordeng, T. W., Pedersen, K., Balk, S. P., and Bakke, O. (1999) <i>J. Immunol.</i> 162, 1488‚Äì1495) we have shown that CD1d contained a classic tyrosine-based internalization signal (YQGV) in its short cytoplasmic tail. CD1d is expressed in polarized epithelial cells, and we found that the cytoplasmic tail of CD1d also contained information for basolateral sorting. Interestingly, a mutation of the critical tyrosine residue of the endosomal sorting signal did not result in the loss of basolateral targeting of the mutant CD1d. To search for a basolateral sorting signal we have constructed a full set of alanine mutants, but no single alanine substitution inactivated the signal. However, deletions or mutations of either the C-terminal valine/leucine pair or the critical tyrosine residue from the internalization signal and either residue from the C-terminal valine/leucine pair inactivated basolateral sorting. Our data thus suggest that the cytoplasmic tail contains two overlapping basolateral signals, one tyrosine- and the other leucine-based, each being sufficient to direct CD1d to the basolateral membrane of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells."

These GSTs stabilize the thiolate form of GSH, which is the reactive species, by making a hydrogen bond from the hydroxyl group of a Tyr residue in the N-terminal region to the deprotonated sulfhydryl group, thereby facilitating catalysis (see Ref.4.Armstrong R.N.

Tan K.-L. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Structure. 1998; 6: 309-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and because the leaving group in the MS reaction is a sulfate ion the available experimental data led to the hypothesis that GST T2-2 could act as a sulfatase in the presence of GSH or GSH analogs (8.Tan K.-L. Chelvanayagam G. Parker M.W. Board P.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9.Rossjohn J. McKinstry W.J. Oakley A.J. Verger D. Flanagan J. Chelvanayagam G. Tan K.-L. Board P.G. Parker M.W. Structure. 1998; 6: 309-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The proposed menaphthyl carbonium ion derived from MS would be able to react with any thiol group and not exclusively with the enzyme-bound GSH thiolate. However, recent work on the rat ortholog of GST T2-2 (rGST T2-2) indicated that the Ser residue may in fact contribute to the catalysis of the MS reaction (10.Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9982-9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To investigate the possibility that Ser11 is involved in stabilization of rGST T2-2-bound GSH thiolate in the reaction with MS, as well as with other electrophiles, and to test the sulfatase hypothesis, we have made the S11A mutation in the rat GST T2-2. The mutant enzyme was characterized with regard to steady-state as well as pre-steady-state kinetics, and the results were compared with those of the wild type enzyme. S-(1-Menaphthyl)glutathione (MSG) was synthesized essentially as described by Hyde and Young (11.Hyde C.W. Young L. Biochem. J. 1968; 107: 519-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MS was a kind gift from Dr. Brian Gillham, synthesized as described by Clapp and Young (12.Clapp J.J. Young L. Biochem. J. 1970; 118: 765-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). S-Propylglutathione was synthesized essentially as described by Vince et al. (13.Vince R. Daluge S. Wadd W.B. J. Med. Chem. 1971; 14: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). All other chemicals used were of high purity and obtained from commercial sources. Enzymes for recombinant DNA work were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and MBI Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania). The expression plasmid pKRT2 encoding rGST T2-2 (14.Jemth P. Stenberg G. Chaga G. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was used as template in a mutagenic polymerase chain reaction. Primers used to insert the mutations in the cDNA were 1) 5‚Ä≤-GAA ACAGAA TTC ATG GGT TTG GAG CTC TAC CTG GAC CTG CTGGCT CAG CCC AGC-3‚Ä≤ and 2) 5‚Ä≤-CTC GAG GTC GAC CTG CAG TTA GGG AAT CCT GGC AAT TCG AAG-3‚Ä≤. The triplet encoding the Ser to Ala mutation is underlined and restriction sites are italicized. A polymerase chain reaction contained approximately 5 ng of pKRT2 DNA, 0.8 Œºm of each primer, 0.13 mm dNTPs, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase and buffer as recommended by the manufacturer of the polymerase (MBI Fermentas) in a total volume of 100 Œºl. The reaction comprised 35 cycles of 1 min at 95 ¬∞C, 1.5 min at 55 ¬∞C, and 1 min at 72 ¬∞C, followed by 10 min at 72 ¬∞C. The products of several polymerase chain reactions were run on a 1.2% (w/v) agarose gel. A DNA fragment of the expected size, approximately 740 base pairs, was excised from the gel and purified with Gene CleanIII silica matrix (BIO 101, La Jolla, CA). The fragment was digested withEcoRI and SalI restriction enzymes and subsequently ligated to the corresponding cloning sites of the pGEM-3Zf(+) plasmid (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). These plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The cDNA encoding the S11A mutant of rGST T2-2 was then subcloned into the expression vector pKK-D (15.BjoÃàrnestedt R. Widersten M. Board P.G. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the resulting construct, named pKRT2S11A, was used to transformE. coli XL1-Blue cells. DNA sequence analysis of the cloned fragment was performed to ensure that the mutations in codon 11 were inserted and that no other mutations were present. Heterologous expression of wild type and mutant rGST T2-2, using the pKRT2S11A construct, and subsequent purification were performed as described previously for the wild type enzyme (14.Jemth P. Stenberg G. Chaga G. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All kinetic measurements were performed at 30 ¬∞C in sodium acetate (<pH 6), sodium phosphate (pH 6‚Äì8), triethanolamine hydrochloride (pH 8.3), or sodium glycine buffer (>pH 8.5). Steady-state kinetic measurements were performed on a Varian 2290 spectrophotometer. The activity with MS was measured as described by Gillham (5.Gillham B. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the activities with 4-nitrobenzyl chloride (NBC) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene were measured as described by Habiget al. (16.Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was determined in presence of 10 mm GSH and 0.50 mm of the electrophile in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 6.5. The steady-state parametersk cat,K mGSH, andK mMS for the MS reaction were determined by varying the GSH concentration (0.010‚Äì10 mm) at a constant MS concentration (25 Œºm) and by varying the MS concentration (0.3‚Äì50 Œºm) at a constant GSH concentration (5 mm for S11A mutant and 10 mm for wild type) and then fitting the Michaelis-Menten equation to initial rate data.K mGSH for the NBC reaction was obtained in a similar fashion, except that the NBC concentration was held constant at 100 Œºm when the GSH concentration was varied. k cat andK mNBC values for the NBC reaction were determined at constant GSH (10 mm) and varying NBC concentration (5‚Äì500 Œºm). To obtaink cat/K m values, a first degree rational function was fitted to the same data set of initial rates as was used when the k cat andK m values were determined. Apparent pK a values for the pH dependence ofk cat for the S11A mutant were estimated by fitting a second degree rational function tok cat as a function hydroxide ion concentration. Steady-state kinetics in the presence of sucrose was measured in 0.1m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, at saturating concentration of GSH (5 mm for S11A mutant, 10 mm for wild type) and varying MS (0.3‚Äì10 Œºm) or saturating MS (50 Œºm) and varying GSH (0.04‚Äì5 mm). Values for the relative viscosities used (1.00, 1.22, 1.47, 2.48, and 3.15) were based on the values given by Brouwer and Kirsch (17.Brouwer A.C. Kirsch J.F. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1302-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Control experiments with another viscosogen, glycerol, were performed to confirm that sucrose did not inhibit rGST T2-2 nonspecifically. Enzymatic activities for both wild type rGST T2-2 and the S11A mutant with 2-mercaptoethanol and MS as substrates were measured in presence of the cofactors S-methylglutathione orS-propylglutathione in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. The concentrations of the cofactors were varied at constant concentration of MS (45 Œºm) and 2-mercaptoethanol (30 mm). The concentration of 2-mercaptoethanol was varied at constant MS (45 Œºm) and cofactor (10 mm), and the concentration of MS was varied at constant 2-mercaptoethanol (30 mm) and S-propylglutathione (10 mm). The extinction coefficient forS-(1-menaphthyl)-2-mercaptoethanol was determined as 7.5 mm‚àí1 cm‚àí1 at 298 nm by letting the rGST T2-2-catalyzed reaction between different concentrations of MS and 2-mercaptoethanol go to completion. Because the extinction coefficient for MS is 1.4 mm‚àí1cm‚àí1 (5.Gillham B. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) the value of the extinction coefficient used in the calculations was 6.1 mm‚àí1cm‚àí1. In a similar experiment with 2-mercaptoethanol as alternative thiol and 10 mm S-methylglutathione as cofactor, NBC was used as electrophilic substrate. Formation of product was then monitored at 310 nm (16.Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rate constants for different reaction steps at 30 ¬∞C are defined in Fig.1. The reaction scheme in Fig. 1 is a modification of the reaction scheme for wild type rGST T2-2 determined at 15 ¬∞C (10.Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9982-9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Pre-steady-state kinetic measurements were performed at 30 ¬∞C with both the S11A mutant and wild type rGST T2-2 on a stopped flow spectrophotometer from Applied Photophysics (Leatherhead, Kent, UK). The buffers used were the same as for steady-state kinetics. The final concentrations (after the rapid mixing) of reactants and buffer in the experiments are given below. GSH solutions were neutralized with NaOH such that additions would not cause an acidification of the reaction mixture. The choice of fitting single exponentials to experimental traces was based on analysis of the residuals using the software supplied with the stopped flow spectrometer and statistical criteria (18.Mannervik B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 370-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) in the SIMFIT program (19.Bardsley W.G. Bukhari N.A.J. Ferguson M.W.J. Cachaza J.A. Burguillo F.J. Computers Chem. 1995; 19: 75-84Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The rate constant for pre-steady-state formation of product on the enzyme (k 4) was determined by mixing 50 Œºm MS with 3 Œºm subunit preincubated with 10 mm GSH and measuring increase in absorbance at 298 nm. A single exponential function was fitted to the average of four to eight individual traces to obtain observed rate constants for pre-steady-state product formation. Owing to a high on-rate for MS, the observed rate constants can be used as estimates of the true rate constant k 4. Three or four replicate determinations of k 4 were made at different pH values. An apparent pK a value fork 4 was calculated by fitting a first degree rational function to k 4 plottedversus hydroxide ion concentration. Pre-steady-state formation of product was also measured by mixing varying concentrations of GSH (1‚Äì130 mm) with 3 Œºm subunit preincubated with 50 Œºm MS. Observed rate constants were plotted versus GSH concentration and Equation 1, derived from general equations for pre-steady-state kinetics (20.Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 132-190Google Scholar), was used to analyze the data. kobs=k4[GSH]/(K0.5GSH+[GSH])+k‚àí4Equation 1 Pre-equilibrium binding of the product of the catalyzed reaction, MSG, to wild type rGST T2-2 and S11A mutant was studied by mixing 1 or 5 Œºm subunit with different MSG concentrations (0.15‚Äì20 Œºm) at pH 7.5 and measuring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching. Excitation wavelength in all fluorescence experiments was 290 nm, and the emission at wavelengths ‚â•320 nm was detected using a cut-off filter. Observed rate constants were determined from an average of 5‚Äì14 individual traces by fitting a single exponential equation to data. Observed rate constants were plotted versus MSG concentration and analyzed by linear regression. Although the lowest MSG concentrations used in the experiments were below the subunit concentration, the data points were on a straight line. The slope was used to calculate the apparent association rate constant (k ‚àí7app) for MSG. To get a more accurate value of the MSG dissociation rate constantk 7, the data points at low MSG concentrations were favored by weighted regression analysis (weight ‚àù 1/Y 2). The intercept with the y axis was interpreted as k 7. Observed rate constants for MSG displacement by GSH were determined at pH 7.5 by mixing 10 Œºm enzyme subunit, preincubated with 10 Œºm MSG, with different concentrations of GSH in 0.1m buffer and measuring increase in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. A single exponential function was fitted to the average of 5‚Äì10 individual traces to obtain observed rate constants.k obs values were plotted versus GSH concentration and Equation 2 was fitted to data to determinek 9app andk ‚àí9app. kobs=k9app+k‚àí9app KS‚Ä≤/(KS‚Ä≤+[GSH])Equation 2 Apparent pK a values fork 4 and k cat were calculated using SIMFIT. Other regression analyses were performed using the program GraphPad PRISM version 2.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The pH dependence of kinetic parameters as well as the analysis of pre-steady-state kinetics have been described by Fersht (20.Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 132-190Google Scholar). The expression clone pKRT2S11A was successfully obtained as described under ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures.‚Äù DNA sequence analysis confirmed that no mutations other than those in codon 11 were present in the cDNA encoding rGST T2-2. The S11A mutant and wild type rGST T2-2 were expressed and purified as described previously (14.Jemth P. Stenberg G. Chaga G. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The S11A mutation in rGST T2-2 clearly affected the steady-state kinetics with the three electrophilic substrates MS, NBC, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. The steady-state rate constantk cat with MS as electrophilic substrate was lowered by approximately an order of magnitude at all pH values studied (Fig. 2 A and TableI). Thek cat/K mGSHvalues did not change as much as k cat as a result of the mutation, because the decrease ink cat is counteracted by a concomitant decrease in K mGSH. The steady-state constants with NBC as electrophilic substrate were lowered in a similar manner as the values with MS as substrate (Table I). The specific activity with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was decreased from 0.7 to 0.019 ¬± 0.003 Œºmol min‚àí1 mg‚àí1(37-fold).Table IValues for steady-state kinetic parameters of wild type rGST T2‚Äì2 and the S11A mutant at 30 ¬∞C, pH 7.5, with two different electrophilic substratesEnzymek cataWith MS as electrophilic substrate,k cat for the S11A mutant was determined by varying the GSH concentration at saturating MS concentration. For wild type rGST T2‚Äì2, k cat is the average of three different determinations, two with varying MS and one with varying GSH. With NBC as electrophilic substrate, k cat was determined by varying the NBC concentration at saturating GSH concentration. The different approaches used to determine the steady-state constants explain the small discrepancies between somek cat/K m values and the corresponding k cat and K m values.

(14.Jemth P. Stenberg G. Chaga G. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 131-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), obtained at 30 ¬∞C, pH 6.5. Open table in a new tab The viscosity of the reaction medium was found to affectk cat but notk cat/K mGSH(Fig. 3). The slope ofk cat0/k cat versus the relative viscosity Œ∑/Œ∑0 was calculated as 0.5 ¬± 0.1 for the S11A mutant, and 0.6 ¬± 0.1 for wild type rGST T2-2 (wherek cat0 and Œ∑0are the values obtained in the absence of added viscosogen). Thus, both enzyme variants display fractional viscosity dependence onk cat. Owing to the lowK mMS value (1 Œºm) of rGST T2-2, the viscosity dependence ofk cat/K mMSwas difficult to determine; when steady-state rates are measured at MS concentrations of < 1 Œºm, the total difference in absorbance is <0.0025, requiring very low enzyme concentration, which results in low precision of the data. Nonetheless, likek cat/K mGSH,k cat/K mMSseems not to be dependent on the medium viscosity. To further investigate the role of Ser11 and to identify the cause of the lowered catalytic activity, a pre-steady-state kinetic analysis was employed. The pre-steady-state rate constant for product formation is denotedk 4 (Fig. 1) and reflects the transition from the ternary complex of enzyme and productively bound substrates to the complex between enzyme and products. This step represents the chemistry of the reaction. Observed rate constants were obtained by preincubating enzyme with one of the substrates, rapidly mixing with the other substrate in the stopped flow spectrometer, and monitoring the increase in absorbance at 298 nm associated with product formation (5.Gillham B. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although the actual product formation is measured, preceding steps involving binding of the second substrate will affect the observed rate constant. When enzyme preincubated with GSH is mixed with MS, the observed rate constant of product formation follows equation 3 (cf.Equation 1). kobs=k4[MS]/(K0.5MS+[MS])+k‚àí4Equation 3 However, K 0.5MS is very low owing to a large rate constant for association of MS with rGST T2-2; K 0.5MS = (k ‚àí1 +k 4)/k 1, wherek 1 is the on-rate, andk ‚àí1 is the off-rate for MS (10.Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9982-9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, [MS] ‚â´K 0.5MS, and the hyperbolic dependence of k obs on MS concentration, predicted by the equation, was not observed. Further, the rate constant for the reverse chemical reaction (k ‚àí4) is negligible; hence k obs ‚âàk 4. Several determinations ofk obs were made to estimate the true rate constant k 4 at different pH values (Fig.2 B). As shown in the figure, the removal of the hydroxyl group of Ser11 is accompanied by a shift in the apparent pK a value of the pH dependence ofk 4 from 5.7 in the wild type enzyme to 7.9 in the S11A mutant. However, it is clear from Fig. 2 that the decrease ink 4 is not responsible for the decrease ink cat at physiological pH values, becausek 4 is much larger thank cat at pH values of >6. The pre-steady-state formation of product was also measured by preincubating the enzyme with MS and mixing rapidly with GSH. The observed rate constant increased with GSH concentration (Fig.4) as described by Equation 1. At high GSH concentrations, k obs approaches the rate constant for product formation k 4, which was calculated as 131 ¬± 18 s‚àí1 for wild type rGST T2-2 and 43 ¬± 5 s‚àí1 for the S11A mutant at pH 7.5 at 30 ¬∞C. At low GSH concentrationsK 0.5GSH is > [GSH], and the slope of the curve approachesk 4/K 0.5GSH. The parameterk 4/K0.5GSHis the gradient at [GSH] = 0 in Fig. 4. This expression is related to k 3app, the apparent association rate constant for GSH, as follows. k4/K0.5GSH=k3app k4/(k‚àí3+k4)Equation 4 For wild type rGST T2-2,k 3app was determined as 6.0 ¬± 0.6 mm‚àí1 s‚àí1, andk 4/K 0.5GSHwas 3.7 ¬± 0.6 mm‚àí1 s‚àí1 at 30 ¬∞C. That k 3app andk 4/K 0.5GSHare similar is expected because k ‚àí3 for wild type rGST T2-2 was determined as 6 s‚àí1 at 30 ¬∞C; hence,k 4 ‚â´ k ‚àí3 andk 4/K 0.5GSH‚âà k 3app. The value ofk 3app is much less than a rate constant for a diffusion-controlled association. This was explained by a fast pre-equilibrium occurring before binding of GSH (k 2, k ‚àí2 in Fig. 1) giving an apparent association rate constantk 3app =k 3 k 2/(k 2+ k ‚àí2) (10.Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9982-9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 21.Parsons J.F. Xiao G. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6286-6294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).k 3app for wild type rGST T2-2 was measured by time-resolved fluorescence quenching upon binding of GSH. For the S11A mutant, however, this approach did not give useful experimental traces and k 3appcould not be determined separately.k 4/K 0.5GSHfor the S11A mutant was determined as 0.9 ¬± 0.1 mm‚àí1 s‚àí1 (Fig. 4). For wild type rGST T2-2, product release was previously found to be the dominant rate-contributing step at 15 ¬∞C (10.Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9982-9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To investigate the influence of Ser11 on dissociation of product, pre-equilibrium MSG binding experiments with both wild type rGST T2-2 and the S11A mutant were performed at 30 ¬∞C in the present study. The binding of MSG was monitored in the stopped flow spectrometer as time-resolved decrease in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence upon binding of MSG to the enzyme. The previous study on wild type rGST T2-2 showed that binding of the reaction product was biphasic and that product release consisted of at least two steps (with rate constants denoted k 6 andk 7). However, at 30 ¬∞C the enzyme was found to be adequately described by a single exponential equation as judged by residual analysis and other criteria based on the nonlinear regression analysis (18.Mannervik B. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 370-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To investigate this further, binding of MSG to wild type rGST T2-2 was measured at several temperatures from 6 to 35 ¬∞C. The results showed that the second phase that is present in the experimental traces at 15 ¬∞C becomes more pronounced at lower temperatures but disappears as the temperature is raised above 25 ¬∞C. Therefore the experimental traces were analyzed as single exponentials. Also, the reaction scheme for rGST T2-2 in Fig. 1 was adjusted (as compared with that previously published; Ref. 10.Jemth P. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9982-9991Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for 30 ¬∞C by omitting the step corresponding to the second transient. The dependence of the observed rate constants on the MSG concentration for the S11A mutant and wild type rGST T2-2 was subjected to linear regression analysis. The rate constants for dissociation of MSG (k 7) were determined as the intercepts with they axis, and the apparent association rate constants (k ‚àí7app) were determined as the slopes of the curves (Fig. 5). The S11A mutation increases the affinity of rGST T2-2 for MSG both by increasing k ‚àí7app from 3.2 ¬± 0.1 Œºm‚àí1 s‚àí1 in the wild type to 4.1 ¬± 0.2 Œºm‚àí1s‚àí1 in the mutant and by decreasing the dissociation rate constant k 7. The k 7 value was determined as 4.2 ¬± 0.4 s‚àí1 for the wild type and 0.5 ¬± 0.2 s‚àí1 for the S11A mutant. Despite the scatter of the data obtained at high MSG concentrations with the mutant, the results show a significant increase in the affinity. The calculated dissociation constant decreased from 1.3 ¬± 0.2 Œºm for the wild type enzyme to 0.13 ¬± 0.05 Œºm for the S11A mutant. The rate constant for a slow step (k 9 in Fig. 1) in the reaction sequence in which MSG is displaced by GSH was previously determined for wild type rGST T2-2 (10.Jemth P. Mannervik B.

It is also likely to be involved in the formation of chromosomal translocations, some of which may result from interchromosomal recombination. We have investigated the potential of the V(D)J recombination machinery to perform intermolecular recombination between two plasmids, either unlinked or linked by catenation. In either case, recombination occurs in trans to yield signal and coding joints, and the results do not support the existence of a mechanistic block to the formation of coding joints in trans. Instead, we observe that linearization of the substrate, which does not alter the cis or trans status of the recombination signals, causes a specific and dramatic reduction in coding joint formation. This unexpected result leads us to propose a ‚Äúrelease and recapture‚Äù model for V(D)J recombination in which coding ends are frequently released from the postcleavage complex and the efficiency of coding joint formation is influenced by the efficiency with which such ends are recaptured by the complex. This implies the existence of mechanisms, operative during recombination of chromosomal substrates, that act to prevent coding end release or to facilitate coding end recapture.

This implies the existence of mechanisms, operative during recombination of chromosomal substrates, that act to prevent coding end release or to facilitate coding end recapture. recombination signal sequence Chinese hamster ovary polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) V(D)J recombination is the process of assembly of T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes from V, J, and sometimes D gene segments (1.Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphoid-specific proteins RAG1 (recombinationactivating gene 1) and RAG2 (2.Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Baltimore D.

RSSs consist of conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by a nonconserved spacer 12 or 23 base pairs long (12- and 23-RSS). V(D)J recombination occurs efficiently in vivo only between RSSs with different spacer lengths, a restriction known as the 12/23 rule (8.Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar).Recent biochemical studies indicate that V(D)J recombination proceeds through a series of protein-DNA complexes.

Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, the immediate product of cleavage is thought to be a ‚Äúcleaved signal complex‚Äù containing the four free ends (15.Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Usually, RSSs involved in V(D)J recombination are located on the same chromosome, i.e. in cis. However, V(D)J recombination has been implicated in the formation of chromosomal translocations leading to lymphoid malignancies (19.Boehm T. Rabbitts T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20.Boehm T. Rabbitts T.H. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2344-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21.Rabbitts T.H.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1246-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In certain cases, such translocations could be the result of V(D)J recombination occurring in trans, using RSSs on different chromosomes. There have been attempts to address this issue. The first such study attempted, and failed, to detect V(D)J recombination intrans between two plasmids in a transient transfection assay (24.Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1987; 49: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, the assay used may not have been sufficiently sensitive to detect the expected level of trans recombination (see ‚ÄúDiscussion‚Äù). More recently, it was shown that at relatively high concentrations, oligonucleotides separately containing 12- and 23-RSSs can synapse and undergo coupled cleavage in vitro (15.Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Furthermore, interchromosomal V(D)J recombination has been detected in Abelson virus-transformed pre-B cells (25.Bailey S.N. Rosenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, it was reported that 12- and 23-RSSs on separate transiently transfected plasmids could mediate relatively efficient synapsis, coupled cleavage, and signal joint formation. This study also reported a specific and dramatic defect in coding joint formation if the two RSSs were intrans, which led to the proposal that mechanisms exist that selectively disfavor or inhibit coding joint formation intrans (26.Han J.O. Steen S.B. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).In contrast, we find that both coding and signal joint formation can occur relatively efficiently in trans. Our results do not support the existence of the mechanistic block to transcoding joints formation. Instead, a series of experiments with circular, catenated, or linear substrates suggest a model in which the efficiency of coding joint formation is strongly influenced by the efficiency with which coding ends can be recaptured after being released from the post-cleavage complex. Our data suggest that in the transient transfection assay, the vast majority of coding joints form after at least one cycle of coding end release and recapture.DISCUSSIONV(D)J recombination in trans is an important issue because of its potential involvement in a variety of chromosomal rearrangements leading to the development of neoplasias (19.Boehm T. Rabbitts T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 20.Boehm T. Rabbitts T.H. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2344-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 21.Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar, 22.Tycko B. Sklar J. Cancer Cells. 1990; 2: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Liao M.J. Van Dyke T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1246-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34.Vanasse G.J. Halbrook J. Thomas S. Burgess A. Hoekstra M.F. Disteche C.M. Willerford D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1669-1675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it remains difficult to study V(D)J recombination intrans directly using chromosomal substrates, primarily because of the low efficiency of the reaction.In this paper, we show that the cleavage step of V(D)J recombination can be performed in vitro in the presence of Mg2+ and HMG2 with a substrate containing 12- and 23-RSSs in trans. Cleavage is stimulated by the presence of the appropriate partner RSS in trans and, based on previous studies, is likely to occur in the context of a synaptic complex containing the two RSSs (15.Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 35.Eastman Q.M. Leu T.M.J. Schatz D.G. Nature. 1996; 380: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Efficient cleavage intrans was also obtained using oligonucleotide substrates at RSS concentrations somewhat higher than those used in our experiments (2 nm versus 0.45 nm) (15.Hiom K. Gellert M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1011-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Taken together, the results suggest that the reduction of cleavage efficiency we observe for RSSs on unlinked molecules is due to the decrease in RSS local concentration and not to their topological (cis versus trans) location.Given that cleavage in vitro can occur efficiently intrans, it was possible that V(D)J recombination in vivo might also occur in trans. An early study attempted to recover the dimeric circle that would result from recombination in trans between two extrachromosomal substrates but failed after screening 40,000 recovered plasmids (24.Hesse J.E. Lieber M.R. Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. Cell. 1987; 49: 775-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The authors of this study did not draw strong conclusions based on these results, but more recently, the results were cited as evidence against V(D)J recombination in trans (26.Han J.O. Steen S.B. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This does not appear to be a valid argument. The recombination frequency in the PD31 cell line used was sufficiently low that only 150 recombinants would have been expected for RSSs in cis, and several factors would have reduced that number for the trans configuration: (i) many cells would likely have taken up only one of the two plasmids because of the poor transfectability of this cell line; (ii) even in those cells that obtained both plasmids, our results and those of Hanet al. (26.Han J.O. Steen S.B. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) indicate that the events leading to signal joint formation would be reduced in efficiency by an order of magnitude because of the trans configuration; and iii) the only plasmids that would have been scored as trans-recombinants were those that contained both a signal and a coding joint, and prior evidence indicates that this can be quite inefficient because the efficiency of joint formation after cleavage is not 100% (36.Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1553-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 37.Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3900-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hence, it is likely that the methods employed in this early study were not sufficiently sensitive to detect transrecombination.V(D)J recombination between antigen receptor loci located on different chromosomes has been detected in normal lymphoid cells (reviewed in Ref. 1.Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but the low frequency of these events (on the order of one/105 lymphocytes) is consistent with the possibility that they occur subsequent to a chromosomal translocation that puts the two loci in cis (1.Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombination between the murine Ig Œ∫ and Œª loci has been detected in an Abelson murine leukemia virus transformed pre-B cell line, at a frequency about 1000-fold lower than rearrangements in cis (25.Bailey S.N. Rosenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These events were unusual in that they were mediated by two 12-RSSs and generated atypical, imprecise signal joints. Overall, these studies indicate that V(D)J recombination between RSSs located on different chromosomes is a rare event.Our results demonstrate that extrachromosomal substrates containing RSSs in trans can successfully recombine in vivoto yield both signal and coding joints. This was true for RSSs on catenated, circular substrates and for RSSs on unlinked DNA molecules. We conclude that there is nothing intrinsic to the V(D)J recombination reaction that prevents synapsis, cleavage, and joint formation with RSSs located in trans. This, together with the very low frequency of interchromosomal V(D)J recombination events, suggests that regulatory mechanisms exist to suppress V(D)J recombination between different chromosomes. We infer that these mechanisms do not function, or function inefficiently, with transiently transfected extrachromosomal elements. Although the nature of these mechanisms are unknown, it is reasonable to think that they act to inhibit synapsis of inappropriate RSS pairs, either those on different chromosomes or in different antigen receptor loci (38.Aster J.C. Sklar J. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1773-1782Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).How is it that, with extrachromosomal substrates, RSSs intrans undergo synapsis and cleavage at levels only moderately reduced (less than an order of magnitude) compared with thecis configuration? One possibility, raised by the fact that the 12-RSS and 23-RSS in pAT7 and pAT6 are contained in nearly identical plasmid backbones, is that pairing of homologous sequences between different plasmid molecules increases the effective local concentration of the two RSSs. This notion is consistent with the finding that the human homologous pairing protein HPP-1 is an important component of an in vitro end joining system that preferentially joins homologous ends (39.Derbyshire M.K. Epstein L.H. Young C.S. Munz P.L. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 156-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It will be important to determine whether the efficiency of trans V(D)J recombination is altered when the two RSSs reside in plasmids lacking homology.Using circular substrates, placing the RSSs in transresulted in roughly 8- and 40-fold decreases in signal and coding joint formation, respectively, compared with the cisconfiguration. The decrease in signal joint formation that we observe is in good agreement with the 5‚Äì10-fold decrease reported in a recent study by Han et al. (26.Han J.O. Steen S.B. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This study, which was quite similar to ours in design, also assessed the efficiency of RAG-mediated cleavage of the transfected substrates by measuring the abundance of signal ends. Substrates with RSSs in trans yielded about 10-fold fewer signal ends than did a substrate with RSSs incis, a decrease that mirrored the drop in signal joints (26.Han J.O. Steen S.B. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A simple explanation of these results is that RSSs intrans are less likely to synapse and undergo cleavage, resulting in the parallel drop in cleaved products and signal joints.Surprisingly, the aforementioned study found that intermolecular coding joint formation was at least 1000-fold less efficient than intramolecular coding joint formation, yielding a greater than 100-fold drop in the CJ/SJ ratio (26.Han J.O. Steen S.B. Roth D.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 331-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast, we find only a modest 5-fold decrease in this ratio. Each study examined lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines and truncated and full-length RAG proteins. There are no obvious methodological differences between the two studies apart from the method used to recover transfected plasmid DNA (alkaline lysis followed by Qiagen spin column purification in this study; a nondenaturing Hirt method in the study of Han et al.), and this does not appear to provide a straightforward explanation for the differences in the results.To explain the dramatic drop in intermolecular coding joints formation in trans, Han et al. postulated the existence of a mechanism capable of discerning whether two RSSs are incis or in trans at an early step in the reaction and transmitting this information to the postcleavage complex in such a way as to allow signal but not coding joint formation. Because antigen receptor loci are typically quite large, such a mechanism would have to be able to distinguish between synapsis of two RSSs hundreds of kilobases apart on the same chromosome from synapsis of two RSSs on different chromosomes.Our results lead to a quite different model in which there is no intrinsic difference between intermolecular and intramolecular recombination. Rather, we propose that the specific reduction in coding joint formation we observe when two RSSs are in trans or on linear substrates is explained by inefficient retention of coding ends, but not signal ends, in the postcleavage complex. This is consistent with biochemical experiments demonstrating that signal ends are bound much more tightly than coding ends after cleavage (14.Hiom K. Gellert M. Cell. 1997; 88: 65-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 18.Agrawal A. Schatz D.G. Cell. 1997; 89: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Our model predicts frequent accidental release of a coding end from the postcleavage synaptic complex. In addition, it predicts that this coding end can be recaptured by the synaptic complex and successfully incorporated into a coding joint (Fig.6). The effects we observe with atrans configuration of RSSs or with linearized substrates can be explained by a decreased efficiency of recapture of the released coding end with these substrates.Consider first the 5-fold decrease in the CJ/SJ ratio observed for recombination in trans compared with cis. The recapture of a coding end is influenced by the local concentration of the end in the vicinity of the synaptic complex. In a simple model, this in turn depends on the length of the DNA segment connecting the coding end to the signal end, which is acting to tether the coding end to the synaptic complex. With circular substrates, the cisand trans configurations give rise to structurally very similar putative postcleavage complexes (Fig. 6, A andC), with one important difference: in the cisconfiguration, the lengths of the ‚Äútethers‚Äù are 6.4 and 0.4 kb, whereas for the trans configuration, the lengths are both 6.8 kb. Theoretical and empirical considerations (40.Dugaiczyk A. Boyer H.W. Goodman H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 96: 171Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) indicate that the difference between 0.4 and 6.8 kb for one end can account for the 5-fold decrease in the CJ/SJ ratio.The model provides a straightforward explanation for large reductions in the CJ/SJ ratio caused by substrate linearization. The linearizedcis substrate (Fig. 6 B) gives rise to a putative postcleavage complex in which one of the coding ends is no longer tethered to the complex. If this coding end is released, it would be recaptured very inefficiently, if at all, resulting in a complex that could yield a signal joint but not a coding joint. Exactly the same situation arises if one of the trans substrates is linearized, and under both of these circumstances we observe a 20‚Äì25-fold reduction in the CJ/SJ ratio (Fig. 5 C). An even more severe defect is predicted if both of the transsubstrates are linear, because in this situation neither coding end is tethered to the postcleavage complex (Fig. 6 D). Indeed, we observe a 200-fold decrease in the CJ/SJ ratio in this instance (Fig.5 C).It is possible that the loss of supercoiling in some way contributes to the reduction in coding joint formation observed with linear substrates. We attempted to address this possibility by transfecting relaxed circular substrates. Such substrates behave exactly like their supercoiled counterparts, suggesting that supercoiling is not a relevant factor in joint formation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the relaxed circles are rapidly supercoiled upon entry into the cell. Nor can we eliminate the possibility that the linear molecules are rapidly circularized inside the cell, although this seems unlikely because they yield results quite different from circular substrates. It is unlikely that the linear substrates are inherently unstable inside the cell (within the relatively short time frame of the experiments) because they support efficient signal joint formation.An alternative explanation for the greatly reduced CJ/SJ ratio observed with linear substrates is that the presence of free ends on the substrate in some way destabilizes the postcleavage complex, thereby inducing coding end release. This would imply that frequent coding end release occurs only with linear substrates. A related possibility is that linearization could facilitate binding of DNA repair factors (e.g. a nuclease or components of the DNA-dependent protein kinase), and this could interfere specifically with coding joint formation by some unknown mechanism. These alternatives would not explain the 5-fold decrease in the CJ/SJ ratio observed in trans versus cisrecombination.An important implication of our model and the 20-fold reduction of the CJ/SJ ratio upon linearization of the cis substrate is that at least 95% of coding joints formed must have been generated after at least one coding end release-recapture event. This in turn implies that the efficiency of coding joint formation is significantly influenced by the overall stability of the postcleavage complex (which reflects the rates of coding end release and recapture). Recent experiments by Agard and Lewis provide strong support for this hypothesis. 2E. A. Agard and S. M. Lewis, submitted for publication. They demonstrate that cryptic RSSs (thought to bind the RAG proteins poorly) specifically reduce the efficiency of coding joint formation in vivo and do so by acting at a postcleavage step of the reaction. Such cryptic RSSs are proposed to destabilize the postcleavage complex within which important processing reactions (such as coding end hairpin opening) occur. Combined with our findings, it would appear that reducing the time spent in the postcleavage complex (either by increasing the release or reducing the recapture of coding ends) leads to reduced coding joint, but not signal joint, formation.During V(D)J recombination of endogenous antigen receptor genes, one or both of the coding ends is not tethered to a signal end, and yet coding joints appear to form efficiently and quickly. In particular, coding ends are difficult to detect in normal lymphoid precursors and in cell lines actively performing recombination (7.Schlissel M. Constantinescu A. Morrow T. Baxter M. Peng A. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2520-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 41.Ramsden D.A. Gellert M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2409-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 42.Roth D.B.

Biol. 1997; 267: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Together with our results and the considerations noted above, these findings strongly suggest that mechanisms exist to stabilize the postcleavage complex during recombination of endogenous antigen receptor loci and that these mechanisms do not act or act inefficiently with transiently transfected substrates. These mechanisms may function to prevent the release of coding ends or may act to retain released coding ends in the vicinity of the synaptic complex for rapid recapture. Intriguingly, deletion of the T-cell receptor Œ≤ enhancer from the mouse germline preferentially interferes with coding joint formation compared with signal joint formation, leading to the suggestion that factors associated with the enhancer may act to stabilize coding ends in the postcleavage complex (44.Hempel W.M. Stanhopebaker P. Mathieu N. Huang F. Schlissel M.S. Ferrier P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2305-2317Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Our ability to detect significant amounts of both coding and signal joints in trans further supports the possibility of a direct involvement of V(D)J recombination in the generation of chromosomal translocations. The rate of V(D)J recombination in trans on chromosomal substrates, and especially of the relevant loci, remains to be determined. We expect that it will be significantly lower than on extrachromosomal circles. The rate of loss and recapture of coding ends of chromosomal substrates by the synaptic complex also remains to be investigated. V(D)J recombination is the process of assembly of T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin genes from V, J, and sometimes D gene segments (1.Lewis S.M. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 56: 27-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lymphoid-specific proteins RAG1 (recombinationactivating gene 1) and RAG2 (2.Schatz D.G. Oettinger M.A. Baltimore D.

RSSs consist of conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by a nonconserved spacer 12 or 23 base pairs long (12- and 23-RSS). V(D)J recombination occurs efficiently in vivo only between RSSs with different spacer lengths, a restriction known as the 12/23 rule (8.Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies indicate that V(D)J recombination proceeds through a series of protein-DNA complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2109651856,"The C-terminal domain of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) consists of a conserved region and a variable region, and the variable region has been shown to direct the membrane translocation of cytosolic enzymes. The present work has revealed that the C-terminal domain may also be involved in kinase-receptor interaction that is primarily mediated by the conserved region. Truncation of the C-terminal domain or deletion of the conserved region in this domain of GRK2 resulted in a complete loss of its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin and in an obvious decrease in its sensitivity to receptor-mediated phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. On the contrary, deletion of the Œ≤Œ≥ subunit binding region in the C-terminal domain of GRK2 did not significantly alter the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate rhodopsin. In addition, the recombinant proteins that represent the C-terminal domain and the conserved region of GRK2 could inhibit GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin and receptor-mediated activation of GRK2 but not GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the peptide substrate. Furthermore, the conserved region as well as the C-terminal domain could directly bind rhodopsinin vitro. These results indicate that the C-terminal domain, or more precisely, the conserved region of this domain, is important for enzyme-receptor interaction and that this interaction is required for GRK2 to catalyze receptor phosphorylation. The C-terminal domain of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) consists of a conserved region and a variable region, and the variable region has been shown to direct the membrane translocation of cytosolic enzymes. The present work has revealed that the C-terminal domain may also be involved in kinase-receptor interaction that is primarily mediated by the conserved region. Truncation of the C-terminal domain or deletion of the conserved region in this domain of GRK2 resulted in a complete loss of its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin and in an obvious decrease in its sensitivity to receptor-mediated phosphorylation of a peptide substrate. On the contrary, deletion of the Œ≤Œ≥ subunit binding region in the C-terminal domain of GRK2 did not significantly alter the ability of the enzyme to phosphorylate rhodopsin. In addition, the recombinant proteins that represent the C-terminal domain and the conserved region of GRK2 could inhibit GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin and receptor-mediated activation of GRK2 but not GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the peptide substrate. Furthermore, the conserved region as well as the C-terminal domain could directly bind rhodopsinin vitro. These results indicate that the C-terminal domain, or more precisely, the conserved region of this domain, is important for enzyme-receptor interaction and that this interaction is required for GRK2 to catalyze receptor phosphorylation. Interaction between the conserved region in the C-terminal domain of GRK2 and rhodopsin is necessary for GRK2 to catalyze receptor phosphorylation.Journal of Biological ChemistryVol. 275Issue 23PreviewPage 8471, Fig. 2: The symbols at the top and bottom of the figure were incorrect.

Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). A common feature of this family is multi-site phosphorylation of receptor substrates in response to agonist occupancy (2.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation promotes the binding of arrestin, thereby uncoupling the receptor from G proteins and terminating receptor signaling (1.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Based on sequence and functional similarities, the GRK family has been divided into three subfamilies: the rhodopsin kinase subfamily (RK or GRK1), the Œ≤-adrenergic receptor kinase subfamily (GRK2 and GRK3), and the GRK4 subfamily (GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6). Recently, a splice variant of human GRK1 (termed GRK1b) has been identified (3.Zhao X. Huang J. Khani S.C. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5124-5131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and a candidate cone opsin kinase (termed GRK7) has been cloned from cone- and rod-dominant mammalian retinas (4.Weiss E.R. Raman D. Shirakawa S. Ducceschi M.H. Bertran P.T. Wong F. Kraft T.W. Osawa S. Mol. Vis. 1998; 4: 27PubMed Google Scholar). GRKs share a similar structural organization: a centrally located catalytic domain, an N-terminal domain, and a C-terminal domain. The N-terminal domains of GRKs, which are similar in size (‚àº185 amino acids), is believed to be responsible for receptor recognition. The C-terminal domains, which share a fair degree of structural homology but vary in length, can be divided further into two subdomains: a relatively conserved region and a variable region (1.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 2.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The variable region in the C-terminal domain of GRKs contains the site of several posttranslational modifications and regulatory protein-protein interactions, which appear to be involved in the membrane and receptor targeting of GRKs (1.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 2.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Different GRKs adopt different approaches to promote their membrane association, an event that is critical for receptor interaction. For example, the membrane localization of GRK2 and GRK3 is mediated by cooperative binding with the Œ≤Œ≥ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate via their pleckstrin homology domains (5.Pitcher J.A. Inglese J.F. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar, 6.Koch W.J.

Recent studies have demonstrated that GRKs are subject to several modes of calcium-dependent regulation that provide the potential for feedback regulation and signaling cross-talk (9.Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). GRK1 activity in the visual system is inhibited by a Ca2+-binding protein, recoverin. Calcium binding to recoverin promotes its association with GRK1, which inactivates the kinase and thereby reduces its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin (10.Klenchin V.A. Calvert P.D. Bownds M.D. J.

GRK2 and GRK5 are subject to regulatory phosphorylation via protein kinase C, a Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent kinase (13.Chuang T.T. Le Vine III, H. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18660-18665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14.Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Calmodulin is also a potent inhibitor of GRK activity with the following selectivity: GRK5 (IC50 ‚àº 50 nm) > GRK6 ‚â´ GRK2 (IC50 ‚àº 2 Œºm) ‚â´ GRK1 (16.Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recent studies also suggest that GRKs may have more diverse protein-protein interactions within the cell (9.Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the cytoskeletal protein tubulin binds to and is phosphorylated stoichiometrically by GRK2 and GRK5 (17.Carman C.V. Som T. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20308-20316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and that a specific interaction between GRKs and the integral membrane protein caveolin results in potent inhibition of GRK activity (18.Carman C.V. Lisanti M.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8858-8864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which GRKs specifically recognize and phosphorylate activated receptors and the roles of three domains of GRKs in GRK-mediated phosphorylation remain poorly understood. This study investigates the role of the C-terminal domain of GRK2 in receptor phosphorylation. Our results suggest that the conserved region within this C-terminal domain directly participates in the interaction with activated receptors, which is indispensable for receptor phosphorylation. The Escherichia coli expression plasmid of GRK2 was constructed by inserting the cDNA of bovine GRK2 (19.Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar) into pET3a. The cDNA was amplified using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques, including the ExpandTM High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The amplified fragment with the introduced restriction sites was inserted into the expression vector pET3a through theNdeI/BamHI sites. The C-terminal-truncated mutants of GRK2, N1 (1‚Äì457) and N2 (1‚Äì546), were engineered using standard polymerase chain reaction techniques by introducing a stop codon at the expected site. The mutant with 88 internal amino acids deleted (ŒîCC, deletion of 458‚Äì545) was constructed as follows: a 1.4-kilobase fragment encoding the N-terminal 457 amino acid residues (1‚Äì457) and a 0.6-kilobase fragment encoding the C-terminal 144 residues (546‚Äì689) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction. Simultaneously, a new XbaI site with a silent mutation was introduced at both the 3‚Ä≤-end of the large fragment and the 5‚Ä≤-end of the small fragment. These two fragments were then ligated and cloned into the NdeI/BamHI-cleaved pET3a. The GST fusion proteins of the C-terminal domain (amino acids 457‚Äì689, termed C1), the G protein Œ≤Œ≥ subunit binding region (amino acids 546‚Äì689, termed C2), and the conserved region in the domain (amino acids 457‚Äì545, termed CC) of GRK2 were made by introducing the corresponding cDNA fragments into pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by expression in E. coli. Wild-type GRK2 was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using the phage T7 RNA polymerase-based system described by Studier and Moffatt (20.Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). After isopropyl-1-thio-Œ≤-d-galactopyranoside (10 Œºm) induction at 22 ¬∞C for 24 h in tyrptone-phosphate medium, proteins were extracted as described previously (21.Yang Q.H. Wu C.L. Lin K. Li L. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 10: 320-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmDTT, and 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme. The high speed supernatant of the extract from 1 liter of culture was loaded onto a Q-Sepharose FF column (2.5 √ó 10 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which was pre-equilibrated with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol). GRK2 was not absorbed by Q-Sepharose and flowed through the column. The flow-through was pooled and applied to a Blue-Sepharose 4B (prepared in this laboratory) column (2 √ó 8 cm) followed by washing with ‚àº100 ml of 200 mm NaCl in Buffer A. GRK2 was then eluted with 1 m NaCl in Buffer A. The protein was concentrated by precipitation with 70% saturation of ammonium sulfate and chromatographed on an Ultrogel AcA34 column (2.5 √ó 100 cm). The peak fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE, and the fractions containing pure GRK2 protein were pooled and stored at ‚àí20 ¬∞C in 50% glycerol. All the above purification steps were performed at 4 ¬∞C. The three mutant proteins (N1, N2, and ŒîCC, see the schematic representation in Fig. 3 A) were expressed under the same condition as that of the wild-type GRK2. N1 and N2 were purified to homogeneity by the same procedures used for the wild-type enzyme except that, at the final step, a Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column was used instead of the Ultrogel AcA34 column. ŒîCC was partially purified by using a Q-Sepharose FF column and a Blue-Sepharose column. The expression plasmid for fusion protein was transformed into the E. coli strain DH12s and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-Œ≤-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm) at 22 ¬∞C for 16 h. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity absorption on GSH-Sepharose 4B (prepared in this laboratory) and eluted with 5 mm GSH as described (22.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5046) Google Scholar). Purified fusion proteins were dialyzed to remove GSH and incubated with thrombin in the ratio of 1:500 (w/w, thrombin/fusion protein) at 25 ¬∞C for 1‚Äì3 h. GST tags were then removed using GSH-Sepharose beads. Urea-treated rod outer segments (ROS) were prepared as described (23.Chen C.Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The prepared ROS showed negligible endogenous kinase activity and consisted of >80% rhodopsin as assessed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). A truncated form of rhodopsin with 19 amino acid residues deleted from the C terminus (329G-Rho) was made using endopeptidase Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) cleavage as described (23.Chen C.Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complete conversion to 329G-Rho was verified by SDS-PAGE, which showed a single protein band of 32 kDa that could not be phosphorylated by GRK2 (data not shown). The peptide (RRREEEEESAAA) was synthesized by CyberSyn (Alston, PA). A stock peptide solution was prepared and adjusted to pH 7.4 with Tris base. Various concentrations of peptide (0‚Äì1 mm) were incubated with GRK2 or its mutants (100‚Äì400 ng), Œ≤Œ≥ subunits (0‚Äì200 nm, kindly provided by Dr. A. Smarka, University of Rochester, NY), 329G-Rho* (0‚Äì3 mm) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mm [Œ≥-32P]ATP (‚àº1 cpm/fmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a final volume of 20 Œºl at 30 ¬∞C for 30 min or the indicated time and stopped by addition of 4 Œºl of 60% trichloroacetic acid. The quenched reactions were centrifuged at 48,000 √ó g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were transferred to a 2- √ó 2-cm square of P81 paper (Whatman, Clifton, NJ) followed by five washes in 75 mm ice-cold phosphoric acid as described previously (25.Cook P.E. Neville M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). GRK2 activity was defined as the difference in phosphate incorporation in the presence and absence of peptide. Phosphorylation reactions contained, in a total volume of 20 Œºl, urea-treated ROS (0‚Äì10 Œºm), Œ≤Œ≥ subunits (0‚Äì200 nm), and GRK2 (0‚Äì200 ng) in 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm[Œ≥-32P]ATP (‚àº0.5 cpm/fmol). Reactions were bleached with light at 30 ¬∞C for 1‚Äì3 min and stopped with 20 Œºl of 2√ó SDS sample buffer and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (26.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled receptor bands were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and excised and counted to determine the number, in picomoles, of phosphate incorporation. GRK2 C-terminal GST fusion proteins (5 Œºg each) as described above were mixed, respectively, with 50 Œºl of 50% slurry of GSH-Sepharose beads in the presence of 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 ¬∞C, then 5 Œºg of the light-activated rhodopsin pretreated with 1% Triton X-100 was added and the mixture was incubated for another 2 h. After washed four to five times with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmKCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% Triton X-100, the beads were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-rhodopsin antibody (Anti-hodopsin (opsin), RET-P1; Leinco Technologies Inc., Ballwin, MO) and SDS-PAGE, respectively, to detect retention of rhodopsin on the beads and amount of the GRK2 C-terminal GST fusion proteins. The bovine GRK2 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) using the phage T7 RNA polymerase-based system. The enzyme was purified from the cellular extract sequentially using Q-Sepharose FF, Blue-Sepharose 4B, and Ultrogel ACA-34 column chromatography as described under ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures.‚Äù The enzyme was finally purified to homogeneity, as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig.1). About 3 mg of GRK2 was obtained with an approximate yield of 30% from 1 liter of tryptone-phosphate medium. Because it had never been described previously that GRKs were expressed heterologously in prokaryotic cells, doubts arose as to whether the property of GRK2 expressed in E. coli is similar to that expressed in eukaryotic cells. As shown in Fig.2 A, the enzyme expressed inE. coli specifically phosphorylated rhodopsin in a light-dependent fashion and the rate of the phosphorylation was markedly enhanced by about 10-fold by the addition of G protein Œ≤Œ≥ subunits. The kinetic analysis revealed that the enzyme had aK m of 7.8 ¬± 1.4 Œºm and a maximal velocity of 447 ¬± 33 nmol min‚àí1mg‚àí1 for Rho* (Table I). As reported previously, the K m and V max values were, respectively, 6 Œºm and 72 nmol min‚àí1mg‚àí1 for the enzyme purified from bovine cerebral cortex (27.Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. Staniszewski C. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9026-9032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were 14.5 Œºm and 3017 nmol min‚àí1mg‚àí1 for the enzyme expressed inSf9 cells (28.Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that GRK2 preferentially phosphorylates peptides containing acidic residues on the N-terminal side of a serine or threonine, and the synthesized peptide RRREEEEESAAA was a good peptide substrate for GRK2 (23.Chen C.Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B, this peptide could be phosphorylated by the E. coli-expressed enzyme, and the phosphorylation was efficiently activated by 329G-Rho*, a truncated form of Rho*. In addition, Œ≤Œ≥ subunit itself did not affect the peptide phosphorylation but dramatically enhanced the329G-Rho*-activated peptide phosphorylation (Fig.2 B). These results, consistent with the work of Kim et al. (29.Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15412-15418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Chen et al.

Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on the enzyme expressed in Sf9 cells, demonstrate that the recombinant GRK2 purified from bacterial cells has properties very similar to those of the enzyme expressed in eukaryotic cells.Table IComparison of activities of the wild-type and N2 forms of GRK2 for Rho* phosphorylationKinetic parametersEnzyme formsWild-typeN2Vmax(nanomoles of Pi/min/mg)447 ¬± 33409 ¬± 45K m(Œºm)7.8 ¬± 1.440.1 ¬± 4.5Wild-type and N2 forms of GRK2 were expressed, purified, and assayed as described under ‚ÄúExperimental Procedures.‚Äù The kinetic parameters for rhodopsin were measured by incubating 2‚Äì20 Œºmrhodopsin and 200 ng of each form of GRK2 at 30 ¬∞C for 2 min in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmEDTA, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm [Œ≥32P]ATP (‚àº0.5 cpm/fmol).

As schematically represented in Fig. 3 A, GRK2 consists of three domains, the N-terminal domain (amino acids 1‚Äì184), the central catalytic domain (amino acids 185‚Äì455), and the C-terminal domain (amino acids 456‚Äì689). The C-terminal domain of GRKs is involved in membrane translocation of the enzymes (1.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Much attention so far has been paid to the distinctive structure in the C-terminal domains of respective GRKs such as the CAAX motif in GRK1 that directs farnesylation (30.Lorenz W. Inglese J.

However, little heed was given to the region within the C-terminal domain that is rather conserved among the six GRK members (filled with slanted line in Fig. 3 A).

Similarly, Koch et al. (6.Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that removing 57 or 127 amino acids from the C terminus of GRK2 (truncated amino acid residues from 563 or 633, respectively) significantly diminished the basal activity for phosphorylation of rhodopsin. This was presumably due to either protein misfolding or the failure of the interaction of the kinase with the receptor substrate. In order to test whether the C-terminal domain of GRK2 plays an important role in the receptor phosphorylation, we first constructed the N1 mutant, which lacks the C-terminal domain (deleted amino acid residue from 458, Fig. 3 A). The N1 mutant was expressed inE. coli and purified to homogeneity as described above (Fig.1). The effect of deletion was then analyzed by examining the kinase activity of this mutant toward the peptide substrate as well as rhodopsin. Compared with wild-type GRK2, N1 had approximately 60% of the activity on synthesized peptide (Fig. 3 C), which suggested that deletion of the C-terminal domain had no significant effect on the activity of catalytic domain and the global conformation of the enzyme. However, as shown in Fig. 3 B, N1 completely lost the ability to phosphorylate receptor Rho*, even when the mutant was used in excess amount (data not shown). On the other hand, N1 still could be activated by 329G-Rho* in phosphorylating the peptide substrate (Fig. 3 D) but to a lesser extent (3-fold) than the wild-type GRK2 (14-fold). This suggests that the C-terminal domain contributes to the interaction between the enzyme and the receptor. Because the loss of the ability of N1 to phosphorylate Rho* is not due to the malfunction of the catalytic center, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the C-terminal domain is involved in the interaction with rhodopsin and that this interaction is required for receptor phosphorylation. To further investigate which region in the C-terminal domain is responsible for the possible interaction with Rho*, two GRK2 mutants, N2 and ŒîCC, were constructed. As shown by the schematic presented in Fig. 3 A, N2 retains the conserved region of the C-terminal domain (deleted amino acid residue from 547), whereas ŒîCC lacks the conserved region (deletion of 88 amino acid residues, 458‚Äì545, within the C-terminal domain). N2 was also purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1). But the purified form of ŒîCC was very susceptible to aggregation and precipitation (data not shown) so that partially purified ŒîCC was used instead. The kinase activities of N2 and ŒîCC toward the peptide substrate were determined. Compared with the wild-type form, N2 has virtually the same activity, whereas ŒîCC has about 35% of the activity (Fig.3 C). In addition, N2 was activated by 329G-Rho* to the extent close to that of the wild-type enzyme, whereas the activated extent for ŒîCC was similar to that for N1 (Fig.3 D). These results suggest that the two deletional mutants do not show significant changes in the conformations of their catalytic domains and/or the global conformations of the enzymes. Unlike N1 and ŒîCC, N2, which contains the conserved region of the C-terminal domain, did catalyze the phosphorylation of rhodopsin (Fig.3 B). In comparison with the wild-type enzyme, N2 had a higher K m and a slightly lowerV max for rhodopsin (Table I). Based on the results for the three forms (N1, N2, and ŒîCC) of GRK2, it was reasonable to postulate that the conserved region in the C-terminal domain of GRK2 is responsible for the possible interaction between the C-terminal domain and receptor. As expected, N2 was not stimulated by Œ≤Œ≥ subunits (Fig. 3 B), because this mutant lacks the Œ≤Œ≥ binding region. To further analyze the role of the C-terminal domain we used a novel approach. Three respective fragments, as schematically represented in Fig. 5 A, containing the whole C-terminal domain (C1, amino acid residues 457‚Äì689), the sole Œ≤Œ≥ subunit binding region (C2, amino acid residues 547‚Äì689), and the conserved region (CC, amino acid residues 457‚Äì546), respectively, were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli. The fusion proteins were isolated by GSH-Sepharose affinity chromatography. C1, C2, and CC were separated from the GST and recovered as described (Fig.4). Their effects on wild-type GRK2 and N2 mutant-mediated phosphorylation were investigated. As shown in Fig.5 C, all three fragments showed little effect on the activity of the wild-type or N2-mediated phosphorylation of the peptide substrate. However, C1 and CC significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of rhodopsin by GRK2 or its N2 form. In the presence of 1 Œºm C1 or CC, the activities of both the wild-type and N2 mutant were reduced to 40‚Äì60%. As the concentration of C1 or CC rose to 5 Œºm, only 10‚Äì20% of the activity remained (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, C2 did not affect the activity of wild-type GRK2 or N2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin. Similar results were also obtained by using GST-tagged C1, C2, and CC (data not shown). The negligible effect of C1 or CC on GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the peptide suggested that the observed inhibitory effects of C1 or CC on the rhodopsin phosphorylation were probably due to their competitive binding to rhodopsin with GRK2.Figure 4SDS-PAGE of C1, C2, and CC forms of GRK2. The fragments of the C-terminal domain (C1), the Œ≤Œ≥ binding region (C2), and the conserved region (CC) were expressed, respectively, as GST fusion proteins and purified by affinity chromatography. The three fragments were separated from GST-tag by digestion with thrombin. GST was then removed by another affinity chromatography step.

After extensive washing of the beads, retention of Rho* was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-rhodopsin antibody. We found that C1 and CC, but not C2, could bind Rho* (Fig.6). The result clearly demonstrates that the C-terminal domain of GRK2 can interact with Rho* via its conserved region. Based on all the findings in this work, we concluded that the interaction between this conserved region and receptor Rho* is essential for phosphorylation of the receptor by GRK2. As mentioned above, 329G-Rho* activated N1 and N2 as well as the wild-type GRK2 on peptide phosphorylation (Fig. 3 D), and GRK2 mutants C1 or CC could bind rhodopsin (Fig. 6), which likely accounted for its inhibition of the GRK2-mediated receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). Based on these observations, C1 or CC should also have some effects on the receptor-activated peptide phosphorylation by GRK2. As shown in Fig.7, the 329G-Rho*-mediated activation of the wild-type GRK2 and N2 mutant was greatly reduced by C1 as well as CC as expected. As a control, the C2 fragment does not have any effect on these enzymes (Fig. 7). The activation of wild-type GRK2 or its N2 form was reduced to 13‚Äì19% in the presence of 5 Œºm of C1 or CC. However, GRK2 N1, which lacks the whole C-terminal domain, was not affected by any of three fragments (Fig. 7). The results indicate that the interaction between C1 or CC and rhodopsin is highly site-specific and that the GRK2 mutants C1 and CC interfere with the interaction between the wild-type/N2 mutant GRK2 and rhodopsin. It has long been known that the C-terminal domain of GRK2 plays an important role in the translocation of the cytosolic enzyme to the membrane (5.Pitcher J.A. Inglese J.F. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L.

In this work we unraveled a novel function of this domain in receptor phosphorylation. Here different approaches were employed, including C-terminal deletional mutagenesis, analysis of effects of the separate C-terminal domain on the function of GRK2, and in vitro testing of binding of the C-terminal domain with the receptor. Our experiments, with purified proteins, also minimized the potential interferences from other factors involved in the kinase-receptor interaction. Our data clearly demonstrated: 1) Truncation of the C-terminal domain of GRK2 resulted in a complete loss of its ability to phosphorylate the receptor and significant impairment of its sensitivity to the receptor-mediated activation of peptide phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and D); 2) The GRK2 mutant C1, which encompasses the C-terminal domain, inhibited GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of rhodopsin but did not inhibit GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the peptide substrate (Fig. 5); 3) The activation of GRK2 by 329G-Rho* was greatly diminished by the C-terminal domain fragment (Fig. 7); and 4) Rhodopsin was specifically coprecipitated with the GST-tagged C-terminal domain (Fig.6). These results indicate that the C-terminal domain of GRK2 is involved in enzyme-receptor interaction and that this interaction is necessary for GRK2 to catalyze receptor phosphorylation. Previous work had focused on the distal region of the C-terminal domain, which has little homology among different GRK members and was involved in receptor targeting and membrane association (1.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar, 2.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proximal region of this domain is rather conserved and includes a proline-rich motif (PPXXP) and putative sites for kinase autophosphorylation (2.Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Beyond this, little had been known about this conserved region until recently when Yu et al. (35.Yu Q.M. Cheng Z.J. Zhao J. Zhou T.H. Wu Y.L. Ma L. Pei G. Cell Res. 1998; 8: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) reported that GRK1, with deletion of the C-terminal 39 amino acid residues (which included part of the conserved region), lost its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin but retained its ability to phosphorylate peptides. Our current work on GRK2 revealed that this conserved region is important for enzyme-receptor interaction, which was required for phosphorylating receptor by GRK2. This was demonstrated by the results derived from the three C-terminal domain deletional mutants. Among these mutants only N2 retained its ability to phosphorylate rhodopsin (Fig. 3 B). N2 is the only one that includes the conserved region. In addition, the conserved region (CC) rather than the Œ≤Œ≥ binding region (C2) inhibits the activity of GRK2 for rhodopsin (Fig.5 B) and 329G-Rho*-mediated activation of GRK2 (Fig. 7), and CC rather than C2 could bind with rhodopsin in vitro (Fig. 6). Koch et al. (6.Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the Œ≤Œ≥ activation of GRK2 was inhibited by a GRK2 C-terminal GST fusion protein (protein I, residues 467‚Äì689) and a 28-mer peptide corresponding to residues 643‚Äì670 (peptide G). Protein I encompasses the conserved region and the Œ≤Œ≥ binding region, and peptide G corresponds to the last 28 amino acids of the Œ≤Œ≥ binding region. They observed that the inhibitory potency of protein I was one order of magnitude greater than peptide G (IC50 of 7.7 and 76 Œºm, respectively) (6.Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In connection with the data presented in our study, we believe that the much stronger inhibitory effect of protein I was caused by its competitive binding to the receptor with GRK2 through the conserved region. The conservation of the region in the C-terminal domain adjacent to the catalytic domain suggests that this region possesses conserved functions among GRK members. One of the functions, as we have demonstrated, may be the involvement in the GRK2-rhodopsin interaction. It remains to be determined whether the same region is critically involved in the functional interaction of other GRKs and receptors. Such investigation is underway in our laboratory. We greatly thank Dr. Alan Smarka for the generous gift of purified G protein Œ≤Œ≥ subunits and Dr. Dianqing Wu for critical reading of this paper."
