https://openalex.org/W2033169664,"Transcription factor (TF) DNA sequence preferences direct their regulatory activity, but are currently known for only ∼1% of eukaryotic TFs. Broadly sampling DNA-binding domain (DBD) types from multiple eukaryotic clades, we determined DNA sequence preferences for >1,000 TFs encompassing 54 different DBD classes from 131 diverse eukaryotes. We find that closely related DBDs almost always have very similar DNA sequence preferences, enabling inference of motifs for ∼34% of the ∼170,000 known or predicted eukaryotic TFs. Sequences matching both measured and inferred motifs are enriched in chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) peaks and upstream of transcription start sites in diverse eukaryotic lineages. SNPs defining expression quantitative trait loci in Arabidopsis promoters are also enriched for predicted TF binding sites. Importantly, our motif ""library"" can be used to identify specific TFs whose binding may be altered by human disease risk alleles. These data present a powerful resource for mapping transcriptional networks across eukaryotes."

Gire et al. describe Ebola epidemiology on the basis of 99 whole-genome sequences, including samples from 78 affected individuals. The authors analyzed changes in the viral sequence and conclude that the current outbreak probably resulted from the spread of the virus from central Africa in the past decade. The outbreak started from a single transmission event from an unknown animal reservoir into the human population. Two viral lineages from Guinea then spread from person to person into Sierra Leone.

We demonstrate the creation of structural metamaterials composed of nanoscale ceramics that are simultaneously ultralight, strong, and energy-absorbing and can recover their original shape after compressions in excess of 50% strain. Hollow-tube alumina nanolattices were fabricated using two-photon lithography, atomic layer deposition, and oxygen plasma etching. Structures were made with wall thicknesses of 5 to 60 nanometers and densities of 6.3 to 258 kilograms per cubic meter. Compression experiments revealed that optimizing the wall thickness-to-radius ratio of the tubes can suppress brittle fracture in the constituent solid in favor of elastic shell buckling, resulting in ductile-like deformation and recoverability."

Using a systematic approach, we identified 3,118 small-molecule biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in genomes of human-associated bacteria and studied their representation in 752 metagenomic samples from the NIH Human Microbiome Project. Remarkably, we discovered that BGCs for a class of antibiotics in clinical trials, thiopeptides, are widely distributed in genomes and metagenomes of the human microbiota. We purified and solved the structure of a thiopeptide antibiotic, lactocillin, from a prominent member of the vaginal microbiota. We demonstrate that lactocillin has potent antibacterial activity against a range of Gram-positive vaginal pathogens, and we show that lactocillin and other thiopeptide BGCs are expressed in vivo by analyzing human metatranscriptomic sequencing data. Our findings illustrate the widespread distribution of small-molecule-encoding BGCs in the human microbiome, and they demonstrate the bacterial production of drug-like molecules in humans.

When chemists split water, they're also more interested in making fuel, and the simplest product is hydrogen (a combination of protons and electrons). One challenge is keeping the reactive hydrogen and oxygen product streams separate. Rausch et al. present a scheme that captures the protons and electrons in a molecular cluster of silico-tungstic acid. Later, they expose the cluster to platinum, coaxing the acid into releasing hydrogen. Eliminating the mixing risk increases the potential for household use. Science , this issue p. 1326"

Such peacekeeping requires glycosylated proteins (proteins with attached carbohydrate chains) present on the epithelial cell surface, but how glycosylation occurs is unclear. Goto et al. find that fucosylation (a type of glycosylation) of gut epithelial cells in mice requires gut microbes (see the Perspective by Hooper). This process also requires innate lymphoid cells there, which produce the cytokines interleukin-22 and lymphotoxin, presumably in response to microbial signals. These cytokines signal epithelial cells to add fucose to membrane proteins, which allows the détente between microbes and immune cells to continue.

https://openalex.org/W1985136634,"Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 provide both effective pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of HIV-1 infection in murine and nonhuman primate models, suggesting their potential use in humans. Although much is known about the role of variable domains in the neutralization breadth and potency of these bNAbs, the contribution of Fc domains to their activities is, by contrast, poorly characterized. Assessment of the in vivo activity of several bNAbs revealed that FcγR-mediated effector function contributes substantially to their capacity to block viral entry, suppress viremia, and confer therapeutic activity. Enhanced in vivo potency of anti-HIV-1 bNAbs was associated with preferential engagement of activating, but not inhibitory FcγRs, and Fc domain-engineered bNAb variants with selective binding capacity for activating FcγRs displayed augmented protective activity. These findings reveal key roles for Fc effector function in the in vivo activity of anti-HIV-1 bNAbs and provide strategies for generating bNAbs with improved efficacy."

Hofmann et al. asked smartphone users to report their encounters with morality (see the Perspective by Graham). Most moral judgment experiments are lab-based and don't allow for conclusions based on what people experience in their daily lives. This field experiment revealed that people experience moral events frequently in daily life. A respondent's ideology influenced the kind of event reported and the frequency, which is consistent with moral foundations theory. Science , this issue p. 1340 ; see also p. 1242"
https://openalex.org/W2155765704,"A dichotomous choice for metazoan cells is between proliferation and differentiation. Measuring tRNA pools in various cell types, we found two distinct subsets, one that is induced in proliferating cells, and repressed otherwise, and another with the opposite signature. Correspondingly, we found that genes serving cell-autonomous functions and genes involved in multicellularity obey distinct codon usage. Proliferation-induced and differentiation-induced tRNAs often carry anticodons that correspond to the codons enriched among the cell-autonomous and the multicellularity genes, respectively. Because mRNAs of cell-autonomous genes are induced in proliferation and cancer in particular, the concomitant induction of their codon-enriched tRNAs suggests coordination between transcription and translation. Histone modifications indeed change similarly in the vicinity of cell-autonomous genes and their corresponding tRNAs, and in multicellularity genes and their tRNAs, suggesting the existence of transcriptional programs coordinating tRNA supply and demand. Hence, we describe the existence of two distinct translation programs that operate during proliferation and differentiation."

Like plants in a jungle, these cells have to compete for access to light. Gan et al. found that one species of such cyanobacteria, Leptolyngbya , survives on the scraps of leftover light that other photosynthetic cells can't use. When the light is crowded out by competing organisms, Leptolyngbya changes the pathways in its cells that make the light-harvesting molecules and remodels them into structures that can use redder light at longer wavelengths that is unused by other cells.

These findings provide a framework for understanding circuit-level mechanisms underlying opponency between innate behaviors, with implications for their perturbation in psychiatric disorders. Animals exhibit a broad range of innate behaviors that are essential for their survival and reproduction. These include responses to predators or prey, social behaviors among conspecifics, as well as solitary behaviors such as self-grooming (Tinbergen, 1951Tinbergen N. The Study of Instinct. Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, New York, NY1951Google Scholar). The control of innate social behaviors, while observed throughout the animal kingdom, is of particular importance in social species such as humans (Stanley and Adolphs, 2013Stanley D.A. Adolphs R. Toward a neural basis for social behavior.Neuron. 2013; 80: 816-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Abnormalities in social behaviors are associated with several psychiatric disorders (Couture et al., 2010Couture S.M. Penn D.L. Losh M. Adolphs R. Hurley R. Piven J.

An important brain region implicated in the control of innate social behaviors is the medial amygdala (MeA) (Kondo, 1992Kondo Y.

The MeA is one of over a dozen subdivisions of the amygdala (Pitkänen et al., 1997Pitkänen A. Savander V. LeDoux J.E.

It is located only two synapses away from the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a sensory epithelium that detects pheromonal signals (Dulac and Torello, 2003Dulac C. Torello A.T.

Thus, the MeA is situated at an early stage in sensory information processing, suggesting that it may function at a relatively high level in behavioral decision hierarchies (Tinbergen, 1951Tinbergen N. The Study of Instinct. Clarendon Press/Oxford University Press, New York, NY1951Google Scholar). MeA neurons are active during social behaviors such as fighting and mating and in response to chemosensory cues, as evidenced by induction of c-fos, a surrogate marker of neuronal activity (Choi et al., 2005Choi G.B.

The conclusion that the MeA plays a role in social behavior leaves open the question of how it performs this function. On the one hand, the MeA may control social behaviors in a positive-acting manner. In the simplest version of this hypothesis, activation of MeA neurons in response to chemosensory cues would promote social behavior, while in the absence of such activity social behavior would not occur (Figure S1A available online). However, the MeA is known to contain heterogeneous neuronal subpopulations (Bian et al., 2008Bian X. Yanagawa Y. Chen W.R. Luo M.

Modular genetic control of sexually dimorphic behaviors.Cell. 2012; 148: 596-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), whose functions in social behavior are unknown. This raises the possibility that the MeA may control social behaviors in a more complex manner that involves distinct cell types, which may have different or even opponent roles (Figure S1B). Here, we have investigated the cellular control of social behavior by performing functional manipulations of distinct neuronal subpopulations within the posterior dorsal subdivision of MeA (MeApd) (Canteras et al., 1995Canteras N.S. Simerly R.B. Swanson L.W. Organization of projections from the medial nucleus of the amygdala: a PHAL study in the rat.J. Comp.

Cerebral hemisphere regulation of motivated behavior.Brain Res. 2000; 886: 113-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Our experiments reveal that GABAergic neurons in MeApd promote aggression as well as two other innate social behaviors, mating and social grooming. In contrast, neighboring but nonoverlapping glutamatergic neurons in MeApd (and adjacent LHA) promote repetitive self-grooming, an asocial behavior. Moreover, the glutamatergic neurons inhibit social behaviors, in a manner independent of their effect to promote self-grooming. Conversely, GABAergic MeApd neurons suppress self-grooming, in both social and nonsocial contexts. Thus, the MeApd controls both social and repetitive asocial behaviors, via nonoverlapping subpopulations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons, respectively, each of which exerts both positive-acting and antagonistic, negative-acting influences. The MeApd has been implicated in social behaviors (Newman, 1999Newman S.W. The medial extended amygdala in male reproductive behavior. A node in the mammalian social behavior network.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 1999; 877: 242-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, Swanson, 2000Swanson L.W. Cerebral hemisphere regulation of motivated behavior.Brain Res. 2000; 886: 113-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). As a first step toward dissecting the function of MeApd, we focused on offensive intermale aggression between conspecifics, a prototypic social behavior (Adams, 2006Adams D.B. Brain mechanisms of aggressive behavior: an updated review.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 2006; 30: 304-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, Blanchard et al., 2003Blanchard R.J. Wall P.M.

Pharmacol. 2005; 526: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We confirmed that MeApd exhibits elevated expression of c-fos in resident males that had recently attacked an intruder (Figures 1A–1D ). To determine whether c-fos expression is associated with attack, or simply with exposure to conspecific sensory cues, we compared its induction during aggression versus social investigations that did not lead to attack (Figures 1B and 1C). Social investigation in the latter cases occupied ∼40% of the total observation period and was associated with an ∼3-fold increase in c-fos expression. However, the level of c-fos expression in MeApd following episodes of attack was much higher (Figures 1B–1D). Thus, MeApd is active during both social investigation and attack, but more strongly so during the latter, similar to our recent observations in the ventrolateral subdivision of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl) (Lee et al., 2014Lee H. Kim D.-W. Remedios R. Anthony T.E. Chang A. Madisen L. Zeng H. Anderson D.J. Scalable control of mounting and attack by Esr1+ neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus.Nature. 2014; 509: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Although lesion studies have suggested that MeApd is involved in aggression, the evidence regarding the valence of its influence is contradictory. Therefore, it was not clear whether activation of MeApd neurons would promote or inhibit attack. Moreover, while MeApd is activated by pheromonal signals (Chamero et al., 2007Chamero P. Marton T.F. Logan D.W. Flanagan K. Cruz J.R. Saghatelian A. Cravatt B.F. Stowers L.

On the one hand, this transformation might occur in structures downstream of MeApd, such as VMHvl (Lee et al., 2014Lee H. Kim D.-W. Remedios R. Anthony T.E. Chang A. Madisen L. Zeng H. Anderson D.J.

To distinguish between these alternatives, we injected wild-type C57BL/6N male mice with a mixture of AAV viruses encoding Cre (CMV-Cre) and a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) (Boyden et al., 2005Boyden E.S.

Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar) (Figures 1E and S2A). The ChR2 virus (AAV-EF1α-FLEX-ChR2-2A-hrGFP) contained a nuclear hrGFP reporter (Lee et al., 2014Lee H. Kim D.-W. Remedios R. Anthony T.E. Chang A. Madisen L. Zeng H. Anderson D.J. Scalable control of mounting and attack by Esr1+ neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus.Nature. 2014; 509: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), allowing visualization of ChR2-expressing cell bodies (Figures 1E, 1F and S2A). Successful photostimulation of MeApd neurons in vivo via an implanted optic fiber (Aravanis et al., 2007Aravanis A.M. Wang L.-P. Zhang F. Meltzer L.A. Mogri M.Z. Schneider M.B. Deisseroth K. An optical neural interface: in vivo control of rodent motor cortex with integrated fiberoptic and optogenetic technology.J. Neural Eng. 2007; 4: S143-S156Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar) was confirmed by double labeling for hrGFP and c-fos (Figures 1F–1G). We examined next the behavioral effects of optogenetic stimulation of MeApd neurons in resident mice in their home cage under infrared light, using the resident-intruder assay (Blanchard et al., 2003Blanchard R.J. Wall P.M. Blanchard D.C. Problems in the study of rodent aggression.Horm. Behav. 2003; 44: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We focused our studies on offensive aggression, a form of aggression that consists of biting and tussling and is initiated by resident animals (see Experimental Procedures). To avoid any intruder-initiated aggression, a more submissive mouse was used as the intruder (see Experimental Procedures). The sessions were video recorded in a customized chamber with two synchronized infrared video cameras at a 90° angle (Figures 1H and S3). Optogenetic activation of MeApd elicited intense, time-locked attack toward intruder males, castrated males, and females (Figures 1I and 1J; Movie S1). To reliably measure the level of time-locked activation of attack that is induced by optogenetic stimulation, we minimized the baseline aggression level by group housing resident animals prior to the virus injection and fiber implantation (see Experimental Procedures). In these ChR2-expressing males, attack was triggered toward male intruders in 100% of ChR2-expressing animals and over 60% of the trials; attack was also triggered toward castrated males and female intruders (Figures 1K and 1L). Attack evoked by optogenetic stimulation included both biting and tussling (Movie S1), similar to the pattern of naturally occurring attack behavior in unmanipulated animals (Kruk, 1991Kruk M.R. Ethology and pharmacology of hypothalamic aggression in the rat.Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1991; 15: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, Kruk et al., 1998Kruk M.R. Westphal K.G.

Biobehav. Rev. 1999; 23: 359-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Furthermore, attack was initiated at the onset and ceased after the offset of photostimulation, with short latencies (Figures 1M and 1N). Episodes of attack occupied 45%–60% of the photostimulation period (Figure 1O). Animals expressing a control EYFP virus in MeApd failed to show any photostimulation-evoked aggression (Figures 1I, 1K, 1L, and 1O). These data indicate that activation of MeApd neurons using a generic promoter can promote aggression. To determine whether attack can be triggered by optogenetic stimulation of a specific, genetically defined population within MeApd, we sought to identify lines of Cre recombinase-expressing mice that could be used to manipulate distinct subsets of MeApd neurons. MeApd consists of both vGAT+ (GABAergic) and vGLUT2+ (glutamatergic) neurons (Choi et al., 2005Choi G.B. Dong H.-W. Murphy A.J. Valenzuela D.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Swanson L.W. Anderson D.J. Lhx6 delineates a pathway mediating innate reproductive behaviors from the amygdala to the hypothalamus.Neuron. 2005; 46: 647-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar), but they are differentially distributed along the medio-lateral axis: vGAT+ neurons are distributed throughout MeApd whereas vGLUT2+ neurons are preferentially enriched in the medial region (Bian et al., 2008Bian X. Yanagawa Y. Chen W.R. Luo M. Cortical-like functional organization of the pheromone-processing circuits in the medial amygdala.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 99: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Figures 2A–2D ). We therefore investigated whether GABAergic and/or glutamatergic neurons might contain aggression-promoting cells. We first asked whether GABAergic and/or glutamatergic neurons are activated during attack, using c-fos induction. Existing antibodies to GABAergic markers do not provide cellular resolution in the MeA (data not shown), precluding a quantitative comparison with c-fos expression. Therefore, we generated double heterozygous male mice that expressed both vGAT-Cre (Vong et al., 2011Vong L. Ye C. Yang Z. Choi B. Chua Jr., S. Lowell B.B. Leptin action on GABAergic neurons prevents obesity and reduces inhibitory tone to POMC neurons.Neuron. 2011; 71: 142-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) and a Cre-dependent reporter ZsGreen (Ai6) (Madisen et al., 2010Madisen L. Zwingman T.A. Sunkin S.M. Oh S.W. Zariwala H.A. Gu H. Ng L.L. Palmiter R.D. Hawrylycz M.J. Jones A.R. et al.A robust and high-throughput Cre reporting and characterization system for the whole mouse brain.Nat. Neurosci. 2010; 13: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (3847) Google Scholar), which provides strong cell body labeling. Double labeling for c-fos and ZsGreen in males that had recently attacked an intruder (Figures 2A–2D) revealed, surprisingly, that more than 90% of the c-fos+ neurons were ZsGreen+, suggesting the majority of c-fos+ neurons induced by attack are vGAT+ (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2E). In contrast, in double-transgenic animals that expressed vGLUT2-Cre and ZsGreen, <10% of the c-fos+ neurons were ZsGreen+ following attack (Figures 2C–2E). Furthermore, ∼30% of the vGAT+ neurons were c-fos+, whereas ∼3% of the vGLUT2+ neurons were c-fos+ (Figure S2E). In control animals that did not experience social interactions, little overlap was observed between c-fos+ and ZsGreen+ neurons (data not shown). These data suggest that neurons in MeApd that are activated during attack behavior are predominantly vGAT+. To determine whether attack could be triggered by optogenetic activation of GABAergic neurons in MeApd, we injected vGATCre/+ male mice with a rAAV virus encoding a Cre-dependent ChR2 (Figures 2F and S2B). Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in acute MeA brain slices confirmed that photostimulation elicited action potentials from ChR2-expressing vGAT+ cells with high fidelity (Figures 2G–2I). Successful photostimulation of ChR2-expressing vGAT+ neurons in vivo via an implanted optic fiber was confirmed by double labeling for hrGFP and c-fos (Figures 2J–2L). Optogenetic stimulation of vGAT+ neurons in MeApd triggered intense attack in all ChR2-expressing animals (Figures 2M and 2N; Movie S2). Attack was triggered toward male intruders in over 90% of the trials and toward castrated males and female intruders in 75%–80% of the trials (Figure 2O), with short latency relative to the onset of photostimulation (Figures 2P and 2Q). When light pulses were delivered under optimal conditions (the resident facing the intruder and within half a body-length) (Lee et al., 2014Lee H. Kim D.-W. Remedios R. Anthony T.E. Chang A.

https://openalex.org/W2017746705,"The balance between oxidative and nonoxidative glucose metabolism is essential for a number of pathophysiological processes. By deleting enzymes that affect aerobic glycolysis with different potencies, we examine how modulating glucose metabolism specifically affects hematopoietic and leukemic cell populations. We find that a deficiency in the M2 pyruvate kinase isoform (PKM2) reduces the levels of metabolic intermediates important for biosynthesis and impairs progenitor function without perturbing hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), whereas lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) deletion significantly inhibits the function of both HSCs and progenitors during hematopoiesis. In contrast, leukemia initiation by transforming alleles putatively affecting either HSCs or progenitors is inhibited in the absence of either PKM2 or LDHA, indicating that the cell-state-specific responses to metabolic manipulation in hematopoiesis do not apply to the setting of leukemia. This finding suggests that fine-tuning the level of glycolysis may be explored therapeutically for treating leukemia while preserving HSC function."

The central dogma of molecular biology states that genetic information encoded in DNA is first transcribed by RNA polymerase, then translated by ribosomes into proteins. However, the DNA sequence of a gene provides little information for predicting when, where, and to what extent its associated RNA and protein products will be expressed. Since the advent of microarray technology, comprehensive gene expression patterns—i.e., the transcriptome—can be precisely and comprehensively quantified across large populations. Unfortunately, transcript levels generally have only modest correlation with the levels of corresponding proteins (Ghazalpour et al., 2011Ghazalpour A. Bennett B. Petyuk V.A. Orozco L. Hagopian R.

Treusch S. Shockley A.H. Bloom J.S. Kruglyak L. Genetics of single-cell protein abundance variation in large yeast populations.Nature. 2014; 506: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Skelly et al., 2013Skelly D.A. Merrihew G.E.

As proteins in most cases are more directly responsible than transcripts in the regulation of cellular pathways—and ultimately phenotypic traits—there is a critical need for efficient, large-scale, and accurately quantitative proteomics methods to complement transcriptomic data sets. Over the past decade, the development of discovery mass spectrometry (“shotgun”) has allowed the first large-scale studies on quantitative proteomics. In this approach, protein extracts are cleaved into short peptide sequences, which are then chromatographically separated and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. This allows the untargeted discovery of thousands of peptides, but if the number of unique peptide fragments in a sample significantly exceeds the number of available sequencing cycles (as in whole proteome extracts), any individual peptide will be inconsistently sampled across repeat analyses. This reduces the technical reproducibility but moreover means that the number of peptides consistently quantified across all (or most) samples decreases as the study size increases (Karpievitch et al., 2012Karpievitch Y.V. Dabney A.R. Smith R.D. Normalization and missing value imputation for label-free LC-MS analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13: S5Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Consequently, discovery mass spectrometry strategy has yielded mixed results in large population studies (Ghazalpour et al., 2011Ghazalpour A. Bennett B. Petyuk V.A. Orozco L. Hagopian R. Mungrue I.N. Farber C.R. Sinsheimer J. Kang H.M.

Quantitative trait loci mapping of the mouse plasma proteome (pQTL).Genetics. 2013; 193: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), particularly as specific peptides of interest cannot be targeted, and the most consistently identified peptides are biased toward those of higher abundance (Callister et al., 2006Callister S.J. Barry R.C. Adkins J.N. Johnson E.T. Qian W.J. Webb-Robertson B.J. Smith R.D. Lipton M.S. Normalization approaches for removing systematic biases associated with mass spectrometry and label-free proteomics.J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To overcome these hurdles, selected reaction monitoring (SRM) was developed, which perfects technical reproducibility and allows consistent multiplexed quantitation of target proteins by deploying a mass spectrometric measurement assay that is specific for each targeted peptide (Lange et al., 2008aLange V. Picotti P. Domon B. Aebersold R. Selected reaction monitoring for quantitative proteomics: a tutorial.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2008; 4: 222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). Thus, hundreds of target peptides can be consistently and accurately quantified across large populations of samples. Recent studies in yeast have shown that the proteins and transcripts of genes are typically controlled by different, distinct mechanisms (Albert et al., 2014Albert F.W. Treusch S. Shockley A.H. Bloom J.S. Kruglyak L. Genetics of single-cell protein abundance variation in large yeast populations.Nature. 2014; 506: 494-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, Picotti et al., 2013Picotti P. Clément-Ziza M.

Reiter L. et al.A complete mass-spectrometric map of the yeast proteome applied to quantitative trait analysis.Nature. 2013; 494: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, these hypotheses have not been well tested in mammalian genetic reference populations (GRPs) through multilayered transcriptomic and proteomic strategies. Large GRPs are frequently used to determine to which extent phenotypic variation is driven by genetic variants (i.e., heritability), and to subsequently identify genes driving such variation. These genes can be identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) or by quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, approaches that have been applied to various species and have led to the successful identification of dozens of major allelic variants (Andreux et al., 2012Andreux P.A.

In mammals, the murine BXD family is the largest and most well-studied GRP, consisting of ∼150 recombinant inbred strains descended from C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2) (Andreux et al., 2012Andreux P.A.

Using 40 strains of this population on both chow (CD) and high fat (HFD) diets, we have obtained major metabolic phenotypes and established a multilayered data set focused on 192 metabolic genes expressed in the liver. For all genes, we know the sequence variants, transcript levels, and protein levels in all cohorts. These data are further supplemented with targeted metabolite analysis in the liver and serum, generating the first large-scale multilayered quantitative picture of any cellular process in the BXD population. We first selected 192 metabolic proteins for study, with particular focus on genes regulating mitochondria and general energy metabolism. For each gene, synthetic peptides were generated based on established assays (Picotti et al., 2010Picotti P. Rinner O. Stallmach R. Dautel F. Farrah T. Domon B. Wenschuh H. Aebersold R. High-throughput generation of selected reaction-monitoring assays for proteins and proteomes.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 43-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A) to accurately quantify each protein across all cohorts. To validate peptide measurements, we compared the coefficients of variation (CV) among technical and biological peptide replicates. Both technical and biological replicates showed a high degree of reproducibility (CV ∼ 0.09 and 0.12, respectively), indicating the quantification of targeted peptides is sufficiently accurate across large, diverse populations. More importantly, the results for biological replicates reveal nearly equally high overall reproducibility (r > 0.98; Figure 1B), suggesting low biological variance within each cohort, particularly relative to cross-cohort variance (CV ∼0.33); 82.1% of the quantified peptides are highly variable (CV > 0.20), indicating that the biological error (i.e., variation within a cohort) is much smaller than the variation induced by differences in genotypes and diet. We observed nearly complete quantification of all 192 proteins across all cohorts, with only ∼60 missing peptide counts out of ∼15,000 measurements (i.e., 99.6% completion; Figure 1C, top). This completion is similar to the level of completeness achieved by microarrays (Figure 1C, bottom) and is a major contrast to shotgun-acquired proteomics, which typically have completeness of ∼70% (Karpievitch et al., 2012Karpievitch Y.V. Dabney A.R. Smith R.D. Normalization and missing value imputation for label-free LC-MS analysis.BMC Bioinformatics. 2012; 13: S5Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). It has been well established that transcriptomic networks of many metabolic processes covary quite well, e.g., within the electron transport chain or within the citric acid cycle (Ihmels et al., 2002Ihmels J. Friedlander G. Bergmann S. Sarig O. Ziv Y. Barkai N. Revealing modular organization in the yeast transcriptional network.Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). At the protein level, proteins that function in common biological processes or that localize to the same functional modules are also reported to be subject to a similar regulatory process and generally covary (Foster et al., 2006Foster L.J. de Hoog C.L. Zhang Y. Zhang Y. Xie X. Mootha V.K. Mann M. A mammalian organelle map by protein correlation profiling.Cell. 2006; 125: 187-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). To validate and identify which of these 192 proteins vary synchronously, we computed the robust Spearman correlation network for all protein pairs using the full SRM data set (Figure 1D). The resulting network contained 82 correlated nodes (proteins) with 211 edges in 3 main enrichment clusters. As expected, proteins within ontologies are highly correlated such as for mitochondria (Figure 1Da) and lipid metabolism (Figure 1Db). Within Figure 1Da are five of the six measured proteins involved in mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) (HSPD1, HSPE1, HSPA9, CLPP, and LONP1, indicated in red), along with three of the four measured NADH dehydrogenase genes (NDUFA1, NDUFB3 and NDUFS6, in blue) and four of the eight measured mitochondrial-encoded proteins (MT-CYB, MT-CO2, MT-CO3, and MT-ND3, in black). Meanwhile, proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism are enriched in the same cluster (Figure 1Dc). These results show that functionally related proteins tend to be coordinately regulated at a protein level and that coregulation of protein abundance is strongly maintained for certain processes. To validate the biological significance of these function-based covariation clusters, we further investigated one: the UPRmt network (elaborated in Figure 6). With the general protein measurements validated, we generated a global overview of how genotype and diet influence differential transcript and protein expression (Figure 2A; numerical values listed in Table S1 available online). At the genetic level, transcripts and proteins map to an equivalent number of significant QTLs: we detected 65 significant transcript QTLs (eQTLs—blue lines at the center) and 57 significant protein QTLs (pQTLs—red lines at the center). However, though the total number of eQTLs and pQTLs are roughly equivalent, the predominant type of regulation was very different: 74% of the eQTLs are cis-mapping (ratio of solid to dashed blue lines), versus only 31% of pQTLs (ratio of solid to dashed red lines). This indicates a closer connection between a transcript and its gene than a protein and its gene. In general, trans-mapping proteins and transcripts mapped evenly across the genome, not yielding any clear “hot spots” for these metabolic genes (sample magnification of QTLs mapping to chromosome 5 is shown in Figure 2B). Within each diet, we found proteins and transcripts to be nominally correlated for ∼25% of genes (i.e., Spearman correlation p value < 0.05; Figure 2C, diets considered separately), similar to findings in other species and populations (Foss et al., 2007Foss E.J. Radulovic D. Shaffer S.A. Ruderfer D.M. Bedalov A. Goodlett D.R. Kruglyak L. Genetic basis of proteome variation in yeast.Nat.

Of the correlated transcript-peptide pairs (46 in CD, 55 in HFD), 31 correlate significantly in both cohorts, whereas 70 pairs correlate in only one dietary cohort. Correspondingly, while ∼50% of genes were affected by diet, transcripts were more frequently influenced (84 of 189) than proteins (37 of 192), with only 21 genes affected at both the transcript and protein levels (Figure 2D). Genes that were the most strongly affected by diet at the transcript level (Figure 2E) tend to be similarly affected at the protein level (Figure 2F)—e.g., Cyp3a11 is higher in CD—though exceptions are frequent, e.g., Srebf1 mRNA is induced by HFD, but unaffected at the protein level, while in another counterexample, the HFD cohorts have more ETFDH protein, but less of the transcript. Thus, while transcripts and proteins are moderately covarying estimations of their gene’s activity and typically have covarying responses to external factors (e.g., diet), these trends are too weak to support the measurement of any one particular transcript to serve as a proxy for the protein (or vice versa) without prior knowledge. Of the 192 target genes, 79 map to a significant eQTL or pQTL in at least one dietary condition. A strong majority of significantly mapped QTLs, ∼80%, are unique to either the transcript level or protein level (Figure 3A). At the transcript level, 28 genes map to cis-eQTLs, 20 of which are in both diets, while 17 transcripts map as trans-eQTLs, none of which are observed in both diets. Together, we observed 65 significant eQTLs stemming from 45 distinct genes (Figure 3B, left; the 20 distinct genes that map cis in both diets contribute 40 significant eQTLs). The range of transcript variance within a diet was a strong predictive factor for observing an eQTL. Transcripts in the least variable quartile (range < 1.5-fold from the lowest to the highest expressing BXD strain) contained only 10% of the significant QTLs. In contrast, the second quartile (range 1.5- to 1.65-fold) contained 17%, the third quartile (range 1.65- to 2.0-fold) contained 29%, and the top quartile (range ≥ 2.0-fold) contained 41% of the significant QTLs.Figure S1Further Overlap of cis-eQTLs and cis-pQTLs, Related to Figure 3Show full captionThe extended selection of genes with cis-pQTLs and cis-eQTLs.

(A, B) Similar to Dhtkd1 and Nnt, Tymp and Gclm also have strong cis-eQTLs, cis-pQTLs, and correlate strongly between the mRNA and protein level, and are not significantly influenced by diet. At the protein level, 57 significant pQTLs stem from 48 distinct proteins (Figure 3B, right). In striking contrast to transcript regulation, only 13 distinct proteins map to cis-pQTLs, five in both diets, while 36 proteins map as trans-pQTLs. No trans-pQTLs are consistent across diets, although three proteins significantly map to separate trans-pQTLs in both diets (Cd44, Acss2, and Ndufs6), and one (Hmgcs1) maps to both cis- and trans-pQTLs. Together with transcript data, we could moderately predict pQTLs: of the 28 genes with cis-eQTLs, 12 correlated well (r > 0.40) between the transcript and protein. Of these 12 genes, five (Dhtkd1, Nnt, Tymp, Gclm, and Bckdhb) map significantly as pQTLs and eQTLs in both diets (Figures 3C, 3D, S2A, and S2B; Bckdhb in Figure 4B), and four (Acox1, Mfn1, Mri1, and Pm20d1) map as pQTLs and eQTLs in at least one diet. Interestingly, three proteins mapped as cis-pQTLs and correlated with their transcript, but did not have associated eQTLs (Hmgcs1, Car3, and Acsf2), suggesting the genetic variant driving these changes manifests more prominently at the protein level than at the transcript level (e.g., Figure 3E).Figure 4Metabolic Consequences of BCKDHB and DHTKD1Show full caption(A) BCKDHB is the E1b subunit of the BCKD complex, which irreversibly converts several BCKAs.(B) Bckdhb mRNA has the strongest eQTLs of the 192 target genes examined in the liver and has among the strongest pQTLs.

(F) Serum 2-AA maps as an mQTL in both diets to proximal chromosome 2, the location of DHTKD1. Diet also plays a clear role in the consistent identification of cis-QTLs. For the 20 genes with cis-eQTLs identified in both diets, HFD significantly affects the levels of only one (Pmpcb; Figure 3F). Conversely, for the eight genes mapping to an eQTL in only one diet, the levels of only three are affected (Ndufs2, Acads, and Aldh4a1). Similar trends are observed at the protein level: of the five cis-pQTLs found in both diets, none are affected by diet, while for the eight genes with cis-pQTLs in only one diet, only the levels of one (Hmgcs1) are affected. This relationship is similar for trans-eQTLs: of the 17 genes with trans-eQTLs, only four are influenced by diet (whereas ∼50% of total transcripts are influenced by diet). However, diet does not appear to strongly influence trans-pQTLs, where 11 of the 39 are affected by diet, a similar proportion to the overall effect, recalling that ∼20% of proteins have levels influenced by diet (Figure 2D). Together this suggests diet can change the genetic factors regulating these genes without changing their overall levels. While high expression variability is associated with stronger QTLs, it is not a definitive predictor, e.g., Mup3 is highly variable, strongly affected by diet, and consistently expressed between mRNA and protein, but does not map to a QTL in any measurement (Figure 3G). Therefore, while the ability to predict peptide levels based on transcript measurements on a systems scale is quite powerful (the ∼25% to ∼37% of correlated transcript-peptide pairs is much better than the ∼5% expected by chance), the probability to fail of any one particular gene is quite high. These chances can be adjusted somewhat—perturbations dramatically affecting transcript levels are more likely to manifest at the protein level and vice versa—but even so, prior research must be established before gene expression can be confidently considered a proxy for protein levels in targeted genetic studies. This also indicates that applying quantitative proteomic data to pathways established at the transcript level can indicate new links that were previously obscured. To characterize the cellular function and potential physiological relevance of the pQTLs, we first collated all Entrez (Maglott et al., 2005Maglott D. Ostell J. Pruitt K.D. Tatusova T. Entrez Gene: gene-centered information at NCBI.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D54-D58Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) and UniProt (Magrane and Consortium, 2011Magrane M. Consortium U.

As the BXDs have extensive historical phenotype and metabolite data available on GeneNetwork (Wang et al., 2003Wang J. Williams R.W. Manly K.F. WebQTL: web-based complex trait analysis.Neuroinformatics. 2003; 1: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), we performed a phenome-wide association study to determine if any collected phenotype data mapped at least suggestively (likelihood ratio statistic [LRS] ≥ 12) as clinical QTLs (cQTL) to the same loci. A handful of phenotypic connections in the BXDs were supported by literature, including a link between Nnt and insulin (Wong et al., 2013Wong N. Morahan G. Stathopoulos M. Proietto J. Andrikopoulos S. A novel mechanism regulating insulin secretion involving Herpud1 in mice.Diabetologia. 2013; 56: 1569-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and between Car3 and subcutaneous adipose mass (Mitterberger et al., 2012Mitterberger M.C.

However, for the majority of pQTLs, no established cQTLs mapped to the same loci. We thus selected the two genes with the most significant and novel pQTLs in both diets for follow-up analysis and validation—Bckdhb and Dhtkd1.Table 1pQTLs Link to PhenotypesProteinDietLRSQTL Area [Mb]GeneFunctionPhenotypeDHTKD1CD43Chr2: 3–8cislysine catabolismReye syndrome, glucose regulationDHTKD1HFD41Chr2: 3–8cislysine catabolismReye syndrome, glucose regulationNNTCD37Chr13: 119–120cisNADPH regenerationinsulin secretionGCLMHFD34Chr3:118–124cisglutathione synthesisdetoxification, ischemia, anemiaNNTHFD31Chr13: 119–120cisNADPH regenerationinsulin secretionPRPS1CD31Chr6: 61–6673nucleotide synthesisarts syndromeGPX1CD30Chr11: 119–12270glutathione peroxidasedetoxification, cardiomyopathyPM20D1HFD29Chr1: 134–137ciszinc binding (putative)tuberculosis sensitivityMT-ND3CD28Chr3: 11–1821complex I subunitLeigh syndromeCMASCD28Chr7: 95–10570sialic acid adhesionfibrosarcoma, dermatomyositisMRI1CD28Chr8: 88–90cistyrosine phosphorylationcell invasion regulationNDUFS6CD27Chr3: 11–1821complex I subunitlactic acidosisPUM2HFD27Chr10: 106–1097RNA bindingdevelopment, cell differentiationBCKDHBCD26Chr9: 83–85cisBCAA degradationmaple syrup urinary diseaseBCKDHBHFD24Chr9: 83–83cisBCAA degradationmaple syrup urinary diseaseTYMPCD24Chr15: 89–90cisthymidine phosphorylationangiogenesis, mtDNA regulationRPL18ACD24Chr3: 25–3133ribosome 60S subunithepatitis susceptibilityCAR3CD24Chr3: 14–21ciscarbon dioxide hydrationlaryngeal disease, adipogenesisDAKHFD24Chr4: 128–13034dihydroxyacetone kinase, FMNglycerolipid metabolismNDUFA4HFD24Chr11: 33–405complex I subunitglucose regulationACADSCD23Chr5: 67–7642beta oxidation, short chainSCAD deficiencyHMGCS1HFD23Chr4: 80–8410cholesterol synthesischolesterolemiaFASNCD23Chr5: 137–13938fatty acid synthesisobesityGCLMCD23Chr3: 118–124cisglutathione synthesisischemia, anemiaABCE1CD23Chr13: 114–12128ribonuclease L inhibitorviral load, RNA stabilityABCB8CD23Chr5: 23–25cismito membrane transporteriron homeost"

To uncover its mechanism of action, an active derivative of P7C3 was modified to contain both a benzophenone for photocrosslinking and an alkyne for CLICK chemistry. This derivative was found to bind nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the conversion of nicotinamide into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Administration of active P7C3 chemicals to cells treated with doxorubicin, which induces NAD depletion, led to a rebound in intracellular levels of NAD and concomitant protection from doxorubicin-mediated toxicity. Active P7C3 variants likewise enhanced the activity of the purified NAMPT enzyme, providing further evidence that they act by increasing NAD levels through its NAMPT-mediated salvage."

Frishkoff et al. compared bird diversity over 12 years in three different kinds of landscape in tropical Central America. They mapped their data onto the bird evolutionary tree and found that more evolutionary branches were lost in intensive agricultural landscapes than in mixed landscapes. In turn, mixed landscapes lost more evolutionary branches than forest reserves. This is not just because of species loss; in fact, mixed agricultural landscapes contained similar numbers of species to those in forest reserves. Evolutionary history is lost because the more evolutionarily distinct species—those with fewer extant relatives and a longer evolutionary history—are more likely to become extinct in agricultural land.

https://openalex.org/W1965643794,"Cyclic di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP) is a broadly conserved second messenger required for bacterial growth and infection. However, the molecular mechanisms of c-di-AMP signaling are still poorly understood. Using a chemical proteomics screen for c-di-AMP-interacting proteins in the pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, we identified several broadly conserved protein receptors, including the central metabolic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (LmPC). Biochemical and crystallographic studies of the LmPC-c-di-AMP interaction revealed a previously unrecognized allosteric regulatory site 25 Å from the active site. Mutations in this site disrupted c-di-AMP binding and affected catalytic activity of LmPC as well as PC from pathogenic Enterococcus faecalis. C-di-AMP depletion resulted in altered metabolic activity in L. monocytogenes. Correction of this metabolic imbalance rescued bacterial growth, reduced bacterial lysis, and resulted in enhanced bacterial burdens during infection. These findings greatly expand the c-di-AMP signaling repertoire and reveal a central metabolic regulatory role for a cyclic dinucleotide."
https://openalex.org/W2096320478,"Misfolded proteins of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are retrotranslocated into the cytosol, polyubiquitinated, and degraded by the proteasome, a process called ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). Here, we use purified components from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to analyze the mechanism of retrotranslocation of luminal substrates (ERAD-L), recapitulating key steps in a basic process in which the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1p is the only required membrane protein. We show that Hrd1p interacts with substrate through its membrane-spanning domain and discriminates misfolded from folded polypeptides. Both Hrd1p and substrate are polyubiquitinated, resulting in the binding of Cdc48p ATPase complex. Subsequently, ATP hydrolysis by Cdc48p releases substrate from Hrd1p. Finally, ubiquitin chains are trimmed by the deubiquitinating enzyme Otu1p, which is recruited and activated by the Cdc48p complex. Cdc48p-dependent membrane extraction of polyubiquitinated proteins can be reproduced with reconstituted proteoliposomes. Our results suggest a model for retrotranslocation in which Hrd1p forms a membrane conduit for misfolded proteins."

Accurate modeling of RNA structure and stability has far-reaching impact on our understanding of RNA functions in human health and our ability to design RNA-based therapeutic strategies. Results The Vfold server offers a web interface to predict (a) RNA two-dimensional structure from the nucleotide sequence, (b) three-dimensional structure from the two-dimensional structure and the sequence, and (c) folding thermodynamics (heat capacity melting curve) from the sequence. To predict the two-dimensional structure (base pairs), the server generates an ensemble of structures, including loop structures with the different intra-loop mismatches, and evaluates the free energies using the experimental parameters for the base stacks and the loop entropy parameters given by a coarse-grained RNA folding model (the Vfold model) for the loops. To predict the three-dimensional structure, the server assembles the motif scaffolds using structure templates extracted from the known PDB structures and refines the structure using all-atom energy minimization. Conclusions The Vfold-based web server provides a user friendly tool for the prediction of RNA structure and stability. The web server and the source codes are freely accessible for public use at “http://rna.physics.missouri.edu”."

Producing lactic acid and H2O2, lactobacilli are believed to play an important role in prevention of colonization by and growth of pathogens. However, to date, there have been no reported studies characterizing how lactobacilli interact with Chlamydia trachomatis, a leading sexually transmitted bacterium. In this report, we demonstrate inactivation of C. trachomatis infectivity by culture media conditioned by Lactobacillus crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii, known to be dominating organisms in the human vaginal microbiome. Lactobacillus still cultures produced lactic acid, leading to time- and concentration-dependent killing of C. trachomatis. Neutralization of the acidic media completely reversed chlamydia killing. Addition of lactic acid into Lactobacillus-unconditioned growth medium recapitulated the chlamydiacidal activity of conditioned media. The H2O2 concentrations in the still cultures were found to be comparable to those reported for the cervicovaginal fluid, but insufficient to inactivate chlamydiae. Aeration of Lactobacillus cultures by shaking markedly induced H2O2 production, but strongly inhibited Lactobacillus growth and lactic acid production, and thus severely affected acidification, leading to significantly reduced chlamydiacidal efficiency. These observations indicate lactobacilli inactivate chlamydiae primarily through maintaining acidity in a relatively hypoxic environment in the vaginal lumen with limited H2O2, which is consistent with the notion that women with higher vaginal pH are more prone to sexually transmitted C. trachomatis infection. In addition to lactic acid, formic acid and acetic acid also exhibited potent chlamydiacidal activities. Taken together, our findings imply that lowering the vaginal pH through engineering of the vaginal microbiome and other means will make women less susceptible to C. trachomatis infection."

One of the primary means by which the UPR alleviates this stress is by reducing protein flux into the ER via a general suppression of protein synthesis and ER-specific mRNA degradation. We report here an additional UPR-induced mechanism for the reduction of protein flux into the ER, where mRNAs that encode signal sequences are released from the ER to the cytosol. By removing mRNAs from the site of translocation, this mechanism may serve as a potent means to transiently reduce ER protein folding load and restore proteostasis. These findings identify the dynamic subcellular localization of mRNAs and translation as a selective and rapid regulatory feature of the cellular response to protein folding stress."

The aim of the present study was to identify and validate new serum biomarkers and demonstrate their potential usefulness for early diagnosis of colon cancer. Methods The study was organized in three sequential phases: 1) biomarker discovery, 2) technical and biological validation, and 3) proof of concept to test the potential clinical use of selected biomarkers. A prioritized subset of the differentially-expressed genes between tissue types (50 colon mucosa from cancer-free individuals and 100 normal-tumor pairs from colon cancer patients) was validated and further tested in a series of serum samples from 80 colon cancer cases, 23 patients with adenoma and 77 cancer-free controls. Results In the discovery phase, 505 unique candidate biomarkers were identified, with highly significant results and high capacity to discriminate between the different tissue types. After a subsequent prioritization, all tested genes (N = 23) were successfully validated in tissue, and one of them, COL10A1, showed relevant differences in serum protein levels between controls, patients with adenoma (p = 0.0083) and colon cancer cases (p = 3.2e-6). Conclusion We present a sequential process for the identification and further validation of biomarkers for early detection of colon cancer that identifies COL10A1 protein levels in serum as a potential diagnostic candidate to detect both adenoma lesions and tumor. Impact The use of a cheap serum test for colon cancer screening should improve its participation rates and contribute to decrease the burden of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2069116752,"Increased lipogenesis is a hallmark of a wide variety of cancers and is under intense investigation as potential antineoplastic target. Although brisk lipogenesis is observed in the presence of exogenous lipids, evidence is mounting that these lipids may adversely affect the efficacy of inhibitors of lipogenic pathways. Therefore, to fully exploit the therapeutic potential of lipid synthesis inhibitors, a better understanding of the interrelationship between de novo lipid synthesis and exogenous lipids and their respective role in cancer cell proliferation and therapeutic response to lipogenesis inhibitors is of critical importance. Here, we show that the proliferation of various cancer cell lines (PC3M, HepG2, HOP62 and T24) is attenuated when cultured in lipid-reduced conditions in a cell line-dependent manner, with PC3M being the least affected. Interestingly, all cell lines - lipogenic (PC3M, HepG2, HOP62) as well as non-lipogenic (T24) - raised their lipogenic activity in these conditions, albeit to a different degree. Cells that attained the highest lipogenic activity under these conditions were best able to cope with lipid reduction in term of proliferative capacity. Supplementation of the medium with very low density lipoproteins, free fatty acids and cholesterol reversed this activation, indicating that the mere lack of lipids is sufficient to activate de novo lipogenesis in cancer cells. Consequently, cancer cells grown in lipid-reduced conditions became more dependent on de novo lipid synthesis pathways and were more sensitive to inhibitors of lipogenic pathways, like Soraphen A and Simvastatin. Collectively, these data indicate that limitation of access to exogenous lipids, as may occur in intact tumors, activates de novo lipogenesis is cancer cells, helps them to thrive under these conditions and makes them more vulnerable to lipogenesis inhibitors. These observations have important implications for the design of new antineoplastic strategies targeting the cancer cell's lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2015121260,"The origin of chordates has been debated for more than a century, with one key issue being the emergence of the notochord. In vertebrates, the notochord develops by convergence and extension of the chordamesoderm, a population of midline cells of unique molecular identity. We identify a population of mesodermal cells in a developing invertebrate, the marine annelid Platynereis dumerilii, that converges and extends toward the midline and expresses a notochord-specific combination of genes. These cells differentiate into a longitudinal muscle, the axochord, that is positioned between central nervous system and axial blood vessel and secretes a strong collagenous extracellular matrix. Ancestral state reconstruction suggests that contractile mesodermal midline cells existed in bilaterian ancestors. We propose that these cells, via vacuolization and stiffening, gave rise to the chordate notochord."

Mutations in Ft cadherins are found in a variety of tumors, and it is presumed that this is due to defects in either Hippo signaling or PCP. Here, we show Drosophila Ft functions in mitochondria to directly regulate mitochondrial electron transport chain integrity and promote oxidative phosphorylation. Proteolytic cleavage releases a soluble 68 kDa fragment (Ft(mito)) that is imported into mitochondria. Ft(mito) binds directly to NADH dehydrogenase ubiquinone flavoprotein 2 (Ndufv2), a core component of complex I, stabilizing the holoenzyme. Loss of Ft leads to loss of complex I activity, increases in reactive oxygen species, and a switch to aerobic glycolysis. Defects in mitochondrial activity in ft mutants are independent of Hippo and PCP signaling and are reminiscent of the Warburg effect."

The fluid can easily be collected, thereby offering new opportunities such as the development of self tests. Our objective was to identify a CVF protein biomarker for cervical cancer or its precancerous state. Methods A differential proteomics study was set up using CVF samples from healthy and precancerous women. Label-free spectral counting was applied to quantify protein abundances. Results The proteome analysis revealed 16 candidate biomarkers of which alpha-actinin-4 (p = 0.001) and pyruvate kinase isozyme M1/M2 (p = 0.014) were most promising. Verification of alpha-actinin-4 by ELISA (n = 28) showed that this candidate biomarker discriminated between samples from healthy and both low-risk and high-risk HPV-infected women (p = 0.009). Additional analysis of longitudinal samples (n = 29) showed that alpha-actinin-4 levels correlated with virus persistence and clearing, with a discrimination of approximately 18 pg/ml. Conclusions Our results show that CVF is an excellent source of protein biomarkers for detection of lower female genital tract pathologies and that alpha-actinin-4 derived from CVF is a promising candidate biomarker for the precancerous state of cervical cancer. Further studies regarding sensitivity and specificity of this biomarker will demonstrate its utility for improving current screening programs and/or its use for a cervical cancer self-diagnosis test."

Test-retest reliability of eight physical activity summary variables was assessed using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and Kappa scores for continuous and categorical variables respectively. In a separate study, the validity of three survey-reported physical activity summary variables was assessed by computing Spearman correlation coefficients using accelerometer-derived reference measures. The Bland-Altman technique was used to determine the absolute validity of survey-reported time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Results In the reliability study, ICC for time spent in different domains of physical activity ranged from fair to substantial for walking for transport (ICC = 0.59), cycling for transport (ICC = 0.61), walking for recreation (ICC = 0.48), cycling for recreation (ICC = 0.35), moderate leisure-time physical activity (ICC = 0.47), vigorous leisure-time physical activity (ICC = 0.63), and total physical activity (ICC = 0.56). The proportion of participants estimated to meet physical activity guidelines showed acceptable reliability (k = 0.60). In the validity study, comparison of survey-reported and accelerometer-derived time spent in physical activity showed strong agreement for vigorous physical activity (r = 0.72, p<0.001), fair but non-significant agreement for moderate physical activity (r = 0.24, p = 0.09) and fair agreement for MVPA (r = 0.27, p = 0.05). Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean overestimation of MVPA of 87.6 min/week (p = 0.02) (95% limits of agreement −447.1 to +622.3 min/week). Conclusion The TPAQ provides a more comprehensive assessment of physical activity and travel behaviours and may be suitable for wider use. Its physical activity summary measures have comparable reliability and validity to those of similar existing questionnaires."
https://openalex.org/W2050459107,"A global map of health R&D activity would improve the coordination of research and help to match limited resources with public health priorities, such as combating antimicrobial resistance. The challenges of R&D mapping are large because there are few standards for research classification and governance and limited capacity to report on R&D data, especially in low-income countries. Nevertheless, based on developments in semantic classification, and with better reporting of funded research though the Internet, it is now becoming feasible to create a global observatory for health R&D."
https://openalex.org/W2012525423,"Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with a defective intestinal barrier and enhanced adaptive immune responses against commensal microbiota. Immune responses against food antigens in IBD patients remain poorly defined. Methods IgG and IgA specific for food and microfloral antigens (wheat and milk extracts; purified ovalbumin; Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis lysates; mannan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were analyzed by ELISA in the serum and feces of patients with Crohn's disease (CD; n = 52 for serum and n = 20 for feces), ulcerative colitis (UC; n = 29; n = 17), acute gastroenteritis/colitis (AGE; n = 12; n = 9) as well as non-inflammatory controls (n = 61; n = 39). Results Serum anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA) and anti-B. fragilis IgG and IgA levels were increased in CD patients whereas antibody (Ab) levels against E. coli and food antigens were not significantly different within the patient groups and controls. Subgroup analysis revealed that CD patients with severe diseases defined by stricturing and penetrating lesions have slightly higher anti-food and anti-microbial IgA levels whereas CD and UC patients with arthropathy have decreased anti-food IgG levels. Treatment with anti-TNF-α Abs in CD patients was associated with significantly decreased ASCA IgG and IgA and anti-E. coli IgG. In the feces specific IgG levels against all antigens were higher in CD and AGE patients while specific IgA levels were higher in non-IBD patients. Anti-food IgG and IgA levels did not correlate with food intolerance. Summary In contrast to anti-microbial Abs, we found only minor changes in serum anti-food Ab levels in specific subgroups of IBD patients. Fecal Ab levels towards microbial and food antigens show distinct patterns in controls, CD and UC patients."
https://openalex.org/W1981890926,"Easily screening markers for early detection of chronic heart failure (CHF) are lacking. We identified twenty differently expressed proteins including orosomucoid 1(ORM1) in urine between patients with CHF and normal controls by proteomic methods. Bioinformatics analyses suggested ORM1 could be used for further analysis. After verification by western blotting, the urinary levels of ORM1 were quantified with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by correcting for creatinine expression. The ORM1-Cr was significantly elevated in CHF patients than normal controls (6498.83 ± 4300.21 versus 2102.26 ± 1069.24 ng/mg). Furthermore, a Spearman analysis indicated that the urinary ORM1 levels had a high positive correlation with the classification of CHF, and the multivariate analysis suggested that the urinary ORM1 content was associated with the plasma amino-terminal pro- brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (OR: 2.106, 95% CI: 1.213-3.524, P = 0.002) and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification (OR: 3.019, 95% CI: 1.329-4.721, P<0.001). In addition, receiving operating curve (ROC) analyses suggested that an optimum cut-off value of 2484.98 ng/mg with 90.91% sensitivity and 85.48% specificity, respectively, could be used for the diagnosis of CHF. To sum up, our findings indicate that ORM1 could be a potential novel urinary biomarker for the early detection of CHF."
https://openalex.org/W2114259959,"To determine the axial length requiring adjustment of measured circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL) thickness to account for ocular magnification during spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).In this prospective study, 148 eyes of 148 healthy student volunteers were imaged by two examiners using three-dimensional SD-OCT. In 54 randomly selected eyes, total cpRNFL thickness was measured with and without adjustment for ocular magnification to establish intra-examiner and inter-examiner measurement error. The 148 eyes were then divided into three groups according to the error values: control group (difference in the corrected and uncorrected total cpRNFL thickness was within the measurement error range), thinner group (the corrected total cpRNFL thickness was less than the uncorrected one), and thicker group (the corrected total cpRNFL thickness was more than the uncorrected one). The cutoff values of axial length between the control and the other groups were calculated by receiver operating characteristic analysis.Measurement error ranged from 4.2 to 5.3 µm; the threshold value was defined as 5.3 µm. The cutoff values of axial length between the thinner and the control groups and between the control and the thicker groups were 23.60 (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.959) and 25.55 (AUC = 0.944) mm, respectively.Axial lengths shorter than 23.60 mm and longer than 25.55 mm require adjustment of measured cpRNFL thickness to account for ocular magnification during SD-OCT.UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (http://www.umin.ac.jp/) under unique trial number UMIN000013248 (date of registration: 02/24/2014)."
https://openalex.org/W1971282974,"Occupational exposure to (benzene, toluene and xylene, BTX is common in the Chinese workplace. Chronic occupational exposure to benzene is associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. This study investigates changes in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and DNA methylation in subjects occupationally exposed to a BTX. Blood DNA samples and exposure data were obtained from subjects with different levels of exposure, including 132 decorators, 129 painters, and 130 unexposed referents in a container-manufacturing factory in Shenzhen, China. Occupational exposure assessment included personal monitoring of airborne benzene, toluene and xylene. Hematological parameters were measured and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay was used to detect DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG), DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) including DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b, methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2(MBD2). PARP1 assay was used to measure PARP activity. Airborne levels of benzene, toluene and xylene in the two exposed groups were significantly higher than those of controls (P<0.001). The two exposed groups (decorators, painters) showed decreased PARP1, DNMTs and MBD2 expression relative to controls (P<0.05), and PARP activity was also decreased (P<0.05). Decreased PARP1, DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b and MBD2 mRNA expression was correlated with increased airborne BTX (Pearson's r: −0.587, −0.314, −0.636, −0.567 and −0.592 respectively, P<0.001). No significant differences in hematological parameters and CBMN were found among the three groups. Together, these results suggest that decreased DNMTs, MBD2 and PARP1 might be involved in the global hypomethylation associated with BTX exposure, and the imbalance of PARP/PARG might participate in the down-regulation of DNMTs. This is the first human study to link altered poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation patterns, which reproduce the aberrant epigenetic patterns found in benzene-treated cells, to chronic occupational exposure to BTX."
https://openalex.org/W2054628467,"De-novo reverse-engineering of genome-scale regulatory networks is a fundamental problem of biological and translational research. One of the major obstacles in developing and evaluating approaches for de-novo gene network reconstruction is the absence of high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions. To establish a foundation for assessing the accuracy of de-novo gene network reverse-engineering, we constructed high-quality genome-scale gold-standard networks of direct regulatory interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that incorporate binding and gene knockout data. Then we used 7 performance metrics to assess accuracy of 18 statistical association-based approaches for de-novo network reverse-engineering in 13 different datasets spanning over 4 data types. We found that most reconstructed networks had statistically significant accuracies. We also determined which statistical approaches and datasets/data types lead to networks with better reconstruction accuracies. While we found that de-novo reverse-engineering of the entire network is a challenging problem, it is possible to reconstruct sub-networks around some transcription factors with good accuracy. The latter transcription factors can be identified by assessing their connectivity in the inferred networks. Overall, this study provides the gene network reverse-engineering community with a rigorous assessment of the accuracy of S. cerevisiae gene network reconstruction and variability in performance of various approaches for learning both the entire network and sub-networks around transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2042167980,"Integration of information by convergence of inputs onto sensory cortical neurons is a requisite for processing higher-order stimulus features. Convergence across defined peripheral input classes has generally been thought to occur at levels beyond the primary sensory cortex, however recent work has shown that this does not hold for the convergence of slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting inputs in primary somatosensory cortex. We have used a new analysis method for multi-unit recordings, to show convergence of inputs deriving from the rapidly-adapting and Pacinian channels in a proportion of neurons in both primary and secondary somatosensory cortex in the anaesthetised cat. We have validated this method using single-unit recordings. The secondary somatosensory cortex has a greater proportion of sites that show convergence of this type than primary somatosensory cortex. These findings support the hypothesis that the more complex features processed in higher cortical areas require a greater degree of convergence across input classes, but also shows that this convergence is apparent in the primary somatosensory cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2162186596,"Isometric contractions induced by neuromuscular electrostimulation (NMES) have been shown to result in a prolonged force decrease but the time course of the potential central and peripheral factors have never been investigated. This study examined the specific time course of central and peripheral factors after isometric NMES-induced muscle damage. Twenty-five young healthy men were subjected to an NMES exercise consisting of 40 contractions for both legs. Changes in maximal voluntary contraction force of the knee extensors (MVC), peak evoked force during double stimulations at 10 Hz (Db10) and 100 Hz (Db100), its ratio (10∶100), voluntary activation, muscle soreness and plasma creatine kinase activity were assessed before, immediately after and throughout four days after NMES session. Changes in knee extensors volume and T2 relaxation time were also assessed at two (D2) and four (D4) days post-exercise. MVC decreased by 29% immediately after NMES session and was still 19% lower than the baseline value at D4. The decrease in Db10 was higher than in Db100 immediately and one day post-exercise resulting in a decrease (−12%) in the 10∶100 ratio. On the contrary, voluntary activation significantly decreased at D2 (−5%) and was still depressed at D4 (−5%). Muscle soreness and plasma creatine kinase activity increased after NMES and peaked at D2 and D4, respectively. T2 was also increased at D2 (6%) and D4 (9%). Additionally, changes in MVC and peripheral factors (e.g., Db100) were correlated on the full recovery period, while a significant correlation was found between changes in MVC and VA only from D2 to D4. The decrease in MVC recorded immediately after the NMES session was mainly due to peripheral changes while both central and peripheral contributions were involved in the prolonged force reduction. Interestingly, the chronological events differ from what has been reported so far for voluntary exercise-induced muscle damage."
https://openalex.org/W2002426720,"It is difficult to derive all qualitative proteomic and metabolomic experimental data in male (pollen tube) and female (pistil) reproductive tissues during pollination because of the limited sensitivity of current technology. In this study, genome-scale enzyme correlation network models for plants (Arabidopsis/maize) were constructed by analyzing the enzymes and metabolic routes from a global perspective. Then, we developed a data-driven computational pipeline using the ""guilt by association"" principle to analyze the transcriptional coexpression profiles of enzymatic genes in the consecutive steps for metabolic routes in the fast-growing pollen tube and stigma during pollination. The analysis identified an inferred pattern of pollen tube-stigma ethanol coupling. When the pollen tube elongates in the transmitting tissue (TT) of the pistil, this elongation triggers the mobilization of energy from glycolysis in the TT cells of the pistil. Energy-rich metabolites (ethanol) are secreted that can be taken up by the pollen tube, where these metabolites are incorporated into the pollen tube's tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which leads to enhanced ATP production for facilitating pollen tube growth. In addition, our analysis also provided evidence for the cooperation of kaempferol, dTDP-alpha-L-rhamnose and cell-wall-related proteins; phosphatidic-acid-mediated Ca2+ oscillations and cytoskeleton; and glutamate degradation IV for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling activation in Arabidopsis and maize stigmas to provide the signals and materials required for pollen tube tip growth. In particular, the ""guilt by association"" computational pipeline and the genome-scale enzyme correlation network models (GECN) developed in this study was initiated with experimental ""omics"" data, followed by data analysis and data integration to determine correlations, and could provide a new platform to assist inachieving a deeper understanding of the co-regulation and inter-regulation model in plant research."
https://openalex.org/W1970814686,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common form of congenital human birth anomalies and a leading cause of perinatal and infant mortality. Some studies including our published genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CHD have indicated that genetic variants may contribute to the risk of CHD. Recently, Cordell et al. published a GWAS of multiple CHD phenotypes in European Caucasians and identified 3 susceptibility loci (rs870142, rs16835979 and rs6824295) for ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) at chromosome 4p16. However, whether these loci at 4p16 confer the predisposition to CHD in Chinese population is unclear. In the current study, we first analyzed the associations between these 3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 4p16 and CHD risk by using our existing genome-wide scan data and found all of the 3 SNPs showed significant associations with ASD in the same direction as that observed in Cordell's study, but not with other subtypes- ventricular septal defect (VSD) and ASD combined VSD. As these 3 SNPs were in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Chinese population, we selected one SNP with the lowest P value in our GWAS scan (rs16835979) to perform a replication study with additional 1,709 CHD cases with multiple phenotypes and 1,962 controls. The significant association was also observed only within the ASD subgroup, which was heterogeneous from other disease groups. In combined GWAS and replication samples, the minor allele of rs16835979 remained significant association with the risk of ASD (OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.08-1.38, P = 0.001). Our findings suggest that susceptibility loci of ASD identified from Cordell's European GWAS are generalizable to Chinese population, and such investigation may provide new insights into the roles of genetic variants in the etiology of different CHD phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2048599514,"Nonlinear optical microscopy was used to image the localization of astaxanthin accumulation in the green alga, Haematococcus pluvialis. Polarization-in, polarization-out (PIPO) second harmonic generation (SHG) and third harmonic generation (THG) microscopy was applied to study the crystalline organization of astaxanthin molecules in light-stressed H. pluvialis in vivo. Since astaxanthin readily forms H- and J-aggregates in aqueous solutions, PIPO THG studies of astaxanthin aggregates contained in red aplanospores were compared to PIPO THG of in vitro self-assembled H- and J-aggregates of astaxanthin. The PIPO THG data clearly showed an isotropic organization of astaxanthin in red aplanospores of H. pluvialis. This is in contrast to the highly anisotropic organization of astaxanthin in synthetic H- and J-aggregates, which showed to be uniaxial. Since carotenoids in vitro preferentially form H- and J-aggregates, but in vivo form a randomly organized structure, this implies that astaxanthin undergoes a different way of packing in biological organisms, which is either due to the unique physical environment of the alga or is controlled enzymatically."
https://openalex.org/W2090223618,"We have characterized the RNA-binding protein RBP33 in Trypanosoma brucei, and found that it localizes to the nucleus and is essential for viability. The subset of RNAs bound to RBP33 was determined by immunoprecipitation of ribonucleoprotein complexes followed by deep sequencing. Most RBP33-bound transcripts are predicted to be non-coding. Among these, over one-third are located close to the end of transcriptional units (TUs) or have an antisense orientation within a TU. Depletion of RBP33 resulted in an increase in the level of RNAs derived from regions that are normally silenced, such as strand-switch regions, retroposon and repeat sequences. Our work provides the first example of an RNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of gene silencing in trypanosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1977729218,"Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is strongly associated with sleep disturbances. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy improves subjective but not objective sleep parameters in patients with GERD. This study aimed to investigate the association between GERD and sleep, and the effect of PPI on sleep by using a rat model of chronic acid reflux esophagitis.Acid reflux esophagitis was induced by ligating the transitional region between the forestomach and the glandular portion and then wrapping the duodenum near the pylorus. Rats underwent surgery for implantation of electrodes for electroencephalogram and electromyogram recordings, and they were transferred to a soundproof recording chamber. Polygraphic recordings were scored by using 10-s epochs for wake, rapid eye movement sleep, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. To examine the role of acid reflux, rats were subcutaneously administered a PPI, omeprazole, at a dose of 20 mg/kg once daily.Rats with reflux esophagitis presented with several erosions, ulcers, and mucosal thickening with basal hyperplasia and marked inflammatory infiltration. The reflux esophagitis group showed a 34.0% increase in wake (232.2±11.4 min and 173.3±7.4 min in the reflux esophagitis and control groups, respectively; p<0.01) accompanied by a reduction in NREM sleep during light period, an increase in sleep fragmentation, and more frequent stage transitions. The use of omeprazole significantly improved sleep disturbances caused by reflux esophagitis, and this effect was not observed when the PPI was withdrawn.Acid reflux directly causes sleep disturbances in rats with chronic esophagitis."
https://openalex.org/W2094301391,"Chronic diseases impose a tremendous global health problem of the 21st century. Epidemiological and public health models help to gain insight into the distribution and burden of chronic diseases. Moreover, the models may help to plan appropriate interventions against risk factors. To provide accurate results, models often need to take into account three different time-scales: calendar time, age, and duration since the onset of the disease. Incidence and mortality often change with age and calendar time. In many diseases such as, for example, diabetes and dementia, the mortality of the diseased persons additionally depends on the duration of the disease. The aim of this work is to describe an algorithm and a flexible software framework for the simulation of populations moving in an illness-death model that describes the epidemiology of a chronic disease in the face of the different times-scales. We set up a discrete event simulation in continuous time involving competing risks using the freely available statistical software R. Relevant events are birth, the onset (or diagnosis) of the disease and death with or without the disease. The Lexis diagram keeps track of the different time-scales. Input data are birth rates, incidence and mortality rates, which can be given as numerical values on a grid. The algorithm manages the complex interplay between the rates and the different time-scales. As a result, for each subject in the simulated population, the algorithm provides the calendar time of birth, the age of onset of the disease (if the subject contracts the disease) and the age at death. By this means, the impact of interventions may be estimated and compared."
https://openalex.org/W1968078302,"Carboxymethyl α-cyclodextrin immobilized Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (CM-α-CD-Fe3O4) were synthesized for the selectively adsorptive extraction of five phenylarsonic acids including p-amino phenylarsonic acid, p-nitro phenylarsonic acid, p-hydroxy phenylarsonic acid, p-acylamino phenylarsonic acid and p-hydroxy-3-nitro phenylarsonic acid in chicken tissue. Using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS), a highly sensitive analytical method was proposed for the determination of five phenylarsonic acids. It was shown that CM-α-CD-Fe3O4 could extract the five phenylarsonic acids in complex chicken tissue samples with high extraction efficiency. Under the optimal conditions, a high enrichment factor, ranging from 349 to 606 fold, was obtained. The limits of detection (LODs) (at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3) were in the range of 0.05–0.11 µg/kg for the five phenylarsonic acids. The proposed method was applied for the determination of five target phenylarsonic acids in chicken muscle and liver samples. Recoveries for the spiked samples with 0.2 µg/kg, 2.0 µg/kg and 20 µg/kg of each phenylarsonic acids were in the range of 77.2%–110.2%, with a relative standard deviation (RSD) of less than 12.5%."
